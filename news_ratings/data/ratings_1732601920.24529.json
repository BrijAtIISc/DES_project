        "text": "An Early Look at Black Voters\u2019 Views on Biden, Trump and Election 2024\nBlack voters are more confident in Biden than Trump when it comes to having the qualities needed to serve another term\n\nVoters cast their ballots at a polling place in downtown Chicago on April 2, 2019. (Kamil Krzaczynski/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nTerminology The terms Black Americans and Black adults are used interchangeably throughout this report to refer to U.S. adults who self-identify as single-race Black and say they have no Hispanic background. Black Americans include those who are registered to vote, not registered or are unsure. Discussions and charts limited to registered voters will be labeled as such and they will be referred to as Black voters. Democrats and Democratic leaners are respondents who identify politically with the Democratic Party or who identify politically as independent or with some other party but lean toward the Democratic Party. Republicans and Republican leaners are respondents who identify politically with the Republican Party or who identify politically as independent or with some other party but lean toward the Republican Party. (In later uses, the terms Democrat and Republican are inclusive of those who lean to each party.)\n\nBlack voters will play a key role in determining the outcome of the 2024 presidential election. And while Black voters remain overwhelmingly Democratic and support Joe Biden over Donald Trump by a wide margin, Biden\u2019s advantage among this group is not as wide as it was four years ago.\n\nToday, American voters are about evenly split between the two major political coalitions, both in their partisan identification and in their presidential vote preference.\n\nBut Black voters remain largely aligned with the Democratic Party (83% identify with or lean to the Democrats), and 77% of Black registered voters say they would prefer to vote for Biden over Trump in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nAt the same time, Black voters are very critical of Trump. Most say he was a poor or terrible president (72%). And many Black adults think he broke the law in his alleged efforts to change the outcome of the 2020 election (65%).\n\nDespite their support for Biden and criticism of Trump, about half of Black voters (49%) say they would replace both Biden and Trump with different candidates if they had the ability to decide. This is similar to the share of all voters who say this.\n\nBlack voters consistently align with the Democratic Party\n\nCurrently, 83% of Black registered voters identify as or lean Democratic, while 12% are Republican or lean Republican. This share is slightly smaller than the 88% who associated with the Democratic Party in 2020. Still, the vast majority of Black voters have consistently identified with or leaned toward the Democratic Party over the last 30 years.\n\nSimilar shares of Black men (81%) and Black women (84%) are affiliated with or lean toward the Democratic Party. Roughly eight-in-ten or more Black men and women have consistently identified with or leaned toward the Democratic Party since 1994.\n\nAlthough the majority of Black voters across education levels are Democrats, there has been a slight decrease in affiliation with the Democratic Party among those with college degrees in recent years. While 93% of Black voters with college degrees identified with or leaned toward the Democratic Party in 2012, that number had decreased to 85% in 2020 and then 79% in 2023.\n\nOverall, older voters have tended to be more Republican than younger voters in recent decades, but this is not true for Black voters. While 7% of Black voters 50 and older currently identify as or lean Republican, 17% of Black voters under 50 are aligned with the Republican Party. This is not new, as younger Black voters have tended to be more Republican than older Black voters over the last 25 years.\n\nWhen it comes to the significance of the 2024 presidential election\u2019s outcome, 55% of Black voters say it really matters who wins. Fewer say it does not matter (17%) or are somewhere in between (28%) in their views of the upcoming election\u2019s importance.\n\nBlack voters\u2019 preferences\n\nAs of April 2024, the majority of Black voters say they would vote for or lean toward Joe Biden (77%). Fewer say they would vote for or lean toward Donald Trump (18%).\n\nAmong all registered voters, 49% favor Trump while 48% support Biden.\n\nThe wide margin between Black voters\u2019 preference for Democratic candidates over Republican candidates is nothing new. In 2016, there was an 85 percentage point difference in the share of Black voters who voted for Hilary Clinton (91%) over Trump (6%). And in 2020, Biden (92%) had a wide advantage over Trump (8%) among Black voters.\n\nThe current margin of support for Biden (59 points \u2013 77% to 18%) is lower than it was in 2020 or for Hillary Clinton in 2016, according to Pew Research Center validated voter studies.\n\nYounger Black voters are more likely than older Black voters to say they would vote for Trump. While about two-thirds of Black voters under 50 favor Biden (68%), 29% support Trump. Black voters 50 and older favor Biden by a wider margin (84% vs. 9%).\n\nHowever, this pattern is reversed among all registered voters: Older voters are slightly more likely than younger voters to prefer Trump (51% vs. 46%), while younger voters prefer Biden (52% vs. 46%).\n\nMany Black voters are dissatisfied with the Biden-Trump matchup\n\nAbout half of Black voters (49%) say they would replace both Trump and Biden with different candidates if they had the ability to do so. An identical share of all registered voters say this.\n\nFewer Black voters say they would keep Biden and replace Trump with a different Republican (36%). Even fewer say they would keep Trump and replace Biden with a different Democrat (8%). And only 6% say they would keep both candidates.\n\nLike the rest of U.S. voters, Black voters differ on this question by age and education. Younger Black voters (57%) are more likely than older voters (37%) to say both candidates should be replaced. And a larger share of older than younger Black voters say they would keep Biden and replace Trump (42% vs. 22%).\n\nNearly 60% of Black voters with a college degree say they would replace both candidates if they had the ability, while 45% of those without a degree say the same.\n\nBlack voters\u2019 views on Biden and Trump as presidents\n\nA majority of Black Americans (55%) approve of the way Joe Biden is handling his job as president.\n\nThis is a shift from a January 2024 Pew Research Center survey, when Black adults were evenly split in their ratings of Biden\u2019s job performance (49% disapproved, 48% approved).\n\nBiden\u2019s ratings among Black Americans were far more positive earlier in his term. For instance, in a March 2021 Center survey, 87% approved of his job performance.\n\nDespite shifts among Black Americans in their ratings of Biden, they are still more likely than other racial and ethnic groups and the U.S. public overall (35%) to approve of Biden\u2019s job performance.\n\nBlack voters are more confident in Biden than Trump\n\nIn further assessments of his presidency, 46% of Black voters say Biden is a great or good president. Far fewer say Trump was great or good during his time in office (12%). And a large majority of Black voters say Trump was a poor or terrible president (72%). Only 19% say the same about Biden.\n\nBlack voters are also much more confident that Biden has the qualities to effectively serve another term as president. A majority of Black voters (56%) are extremely or very confident that Biden respects the country\u2019s democratic values, and half are confident that he acts ethically as president. No more than 8% of Black voters say Trump has either of these qualities.\n\nAlthough most Black voters don\u2019t express much confidence about the mental and physical fitness of either Trump or Biden, they are more confident in Biden. About a third of Black voters (34%) say Biden has the mental fitness needed to serve another term as president, and 26% say the same about his physical fitness. Only about one-in-ten say this about Trump.\n\nBlack voters are more likely than other racial and ethnic groups and the general public overall to say Biden has the mental and physical fitness to serve another term.\n\nTrump\u2019s election-related criminal charges\n\nBeyond their critical views about Trump as president, the majority of Black Americans (65%) also believe he broke the law in an effort to change the outcome of the 2020 election. They are more likely than other racial and ethnic groups \u2013 and the U.S. public overall (45%) \u2013 to hold this view.\n\nBlack Americans\u2019 policy priorities\n\nFor Americans overall, the economy (73%) sits at the top of the list of policy priorities for the president and Congress in 2024.\n\nHowever, for Black Americans, improving the education system (79%) and ensuring Social Security is financially sound (74%) are just as important as strengthening the economy (76%).\n\nClear majorities of Black Americans also say reducing health care costs (72%), dealing with the problems of poor people (70%), reducing crime (68%) and addressing issues around race (65%) should be top priorities.\n\nForeign policy priorities\n\nWhen it comes to international issues, most Black Americans (82%) say it is more important for President Biden to focus on domestic policy than on foreign policy (13%). Most adults in the U.S. share this view, with 83% saying domestic policy is more important.\n\nHowever, when it comes to long-range foreign policy goals, Black adults are more likely than the general public to say that preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction (73% vs. 63%), reducing the spread of infectious diseases (70% vs. 52%) and dealing with global climate change (52% vs. 44%) should be top priorities.\n\nCORRECTION (May 20, 2024): Due to an editorial error, a previous version of the report overstated the share of Black adults who say Trump broke the law in seeking to change the outcome of the 2020 election. It was 65%.",

Because of the large influx of misinformation, Taiwan has taken a public crowdsourcing approach to combatting misinformation, using both fact-checking ChatBots and public dataset called CoFacts. Combining CoFacts with large-language models (LLM), we investigated misinformation across three platforms (Line, PTT, and Facebook) during the 2024 Taiwanese presidential election. We found that most misinformation appears within China-friendly political groups and attacks US-Taiwan relations through visual media like images and videos. A considerable proportion of misinformation does not question U.S. foreign policy directly. Rather, it exaggerates domestic issues in the United States to create a sense of declining U.S. state capacity. Curiously, we found misinformation rhetoric that references conspiracy groups in the West.\n\nimage by mohamed_Hassan on Pixabay\n\nResearch Questions What are the misinformation narratives surrounding the election in Taiwan and how do they target international relations with the United States?\n\nWhat geographical or temporal patterns emerge from misinformation data?\n\nWho are the targets of these misinformation narratives and through what modalities? Essay Summary We leveraged a dataset of 41,291 labeled articles from Line, 911,510 posts from Facebook, and 2,005,972 posts and comments from PTT to understand misinformation dynamics through topic modeling and network analysis.\n\nThe primary form of misinformation is narratives that attack international relations with the United States (henceforth referred to as US-skepticism), specifically referencing the economy, health policy, the threat of war through Ukraine, and other U.S. domestic issues.\n\nTemporal and spatial evidence suggests VPN-based coordination, focused on U.S. issues and addresses.\n\nMisinformation is most common among pan-Blue and ROC identity groups on social media and is spread through visual media. These groups share many themes with conspiracy groups in Western countries.\n\nOur study shows the prevalence of misinformation strategies using visual media and fake news websites. It also highlights how crowdsourcing and advances in large-language models can be used to identify misinformation in cross-platform workflows.\n\nImplications\n\nAccording to Freedom House, Taiwan has one of the highest indices for free speech in Asia (Freedom House, 2022). Additionally, due to its contentious history with China, it receives significant foreign interference and misinformation, especially during its presidential elections. Due to the large influx of dis- and misinformation, Taiwan has developed many strategies to counter misleading narratives, including fact-checking ChatBots on its most popular chatroom app (Chang et al., 2020). Under this information environment, the 2024 Taiwanese presidential election emerged as one of the most divisive elections in Taiwan\u2019s history, featuring at one point a doubling of presidential candidates in a typically two-party race, from two to four. As such, Taiwan is regarded as a \u201ccanary for disinformation\u201d against elections in 2024, as a first indicator to how foreign interference may take place in other democracies (Welch, 2024).\n\nIn this paper, we study the misinformation ecosystem in Taiwan starting a year prior to the election. First, our findings highlight the interaction between misinformation and international relations. As was reported in The Economist and The New York Times, a considerable portion of the misinformation spread in Taiwan before the 2024 election is about US-skepticism, which aims at undermining the reputation of the United States among Taiwanese people (\u201cChina is flooding Taiwan with disinformation,\u201d 2023; Hsu, Chien, and Myers, 2023). This phenomenon is significant because it does not target specific candidates or parties in the election but may indirectly influence the vote choice between pro- and anti-U.S. parties. Given the US-China global competition and the Russia-Ukraine ongoing conflict, the reputation of the United States is crucial for the strength and reliability of democratic allies (Cohen, 2003). Hence, it is not surprising that misinformation about the United States may propagate globally and influence elections across democracies. However, our findings surprisingly show that US-skepticism also includes a considerable number of attacks on U.S. domestic politics. Such content does not question the U.S. foreign policy but undermines the perceived reliability and state capacity of the United States. Here, state capacity is defined as whether a state is capable of mobilizing its resources to realize its goal, which is conceptually different from motivation and trust.\n\nUS-skepticism is commonly characterized as mistrusting the motivations of the United States, as illustrated in the Latin American context due to long histories of political influence (see dependency theory; Galeano, 1997), but our findings suggest that perceived U.S. state capacity is also an important narrative. As most foreign disinformation arises from China, this indicates a greater trend where authoritarian countries turn to sharp power tactics to distort information and defame global competitors rather than winning hearts and minds through soft power. Sharp power refers to the ways in which authoritarian regimes project their influence abroad to pierce, penetrate, or perforate the informational environments in targeted countries (Walker, 2018). In Taiwan\u2019s case, China may not be able to tell China\u2019s story well, but can still influence Taiwanese voters by making them believe that the United States is declining. Our findings suggest that future work analyzing the topics and keywords of misinformation in elections outside the United States should also consider the US-skepticism as one latent category, not just the politicians and countries as is common with electoral misinformation (Tenove et al., 2018). These findings are corroborated by narratives identified by a recent report including drug issues, race relations, and urban decay (Microsoft Threat Intelligence, 2024).\n\nAdditionally, our research investigates both misinformation and conspiracy theories, which are closely related. Whereas misinformation is broadly described as \u201cfalse or inaccurate information\u201d (Jerit & Zhao, 2020), a conspiracy theory is the belief that harmful events are caused by a powerful, often secretive, group. In particular, conspiracy communities often coalesce around activities of \u201ctruth-seeking,\u201d embodying a contrarian view toward commonly held beliefs (Enders et al., 2022; Harambam, 2020; Konkes & Lester, 2017). Our findings also provide evidence of transnational similarities between conspiracy groups in Taiwan and the United States. Whereas the domestic context has been explored (Chen et al., 2023; Jerit & Zhao, 2020), the intersection of partisanship and conspiracy groups as conduits for cross-national misinformation flow deserves further investigation.\n\nSecond, our findings reemphasize that an IP address is not a reliable criterion for attributing foreign intervention. Previous studies on Chinese cyber armies show that they use a VPN for their activities on Twitter (now X) (Wang et al., 2020) and Facebook (Frenkel, 2023). Commonly known as the Reddit of Taiwan, PTT is a public forum in Taiwan that by default contains the IP address of the poster. Our analysis of PTT located a group of accounts with US IP addresses that have the same activity pattern as other Taiwan-based accounts. Therefore, it is likely that these accounts use VPN to hide their geolocation. Our results provide additional evidence that this VPN strategy also appears on secondary and localized social media platforms. Our results suggest that the analysis of the originating location of misinformation should not be based entirely on IP addresses.\n\nThird, our findings show that text is far from the only format used in the spread of misinformation. A considerable amount of misinformation identified on Facebook is spread through links (47%), videos (21%), and photos (15%). These items may echo each other\u2019s content or even feature cross-platform flow. Proper tools are needed to extract and juxtapose content from different types of media so that researchers can have a holistic analysis of the spread and development of misinformation (Tucker et al., 2018). Such tools are urgent since mainstream social media has adopted and highly encouraged short videos\u2014a crucial area for researchers to assess how misinformation spreads across platforms in the upcoming year of elections. This understanding is also important for fact-check agencies because they must prepare for collecting and reviewing information on various topics found in multiple media types across platforms. Crowdsourcing, data science, expert inputs, and international collaboration are all needed to deal with multi-format misinformation environments.\n\nWith prior studies showing that the aggregated fact checks (known as wisdom of the crowds) perform on par with expert ratings (see Arechar et al., 2023; Martel et al., 2023), our case study also evidences how crowdsourcing and LLM approaches can not only quickly fact-check but also summarize larger narrative trends. In Taiwan, this takes form of the CoFacts open dataset, which we use to identify misinformation narratives. CoFacts is a project initiated by g0v (pronounced \u201cgov zero\u201d), a civic hacktivism community in Taiwan that started in 2012. CoFacts started as a fact-checking ChatBot that circumvents the closed nature of chatroom apps, where users can forward suspicious messages or integrate the ChatBot into private rooms. These narratives are then sent to a database. Individual narratives are subsequently reviewed by more than 2,000 volunteers, including teachers, doctors, students, engineers, and retirees (Haime, 2022). As a citizen-initiated project, it is not affiliated with any government entity or party.\n\nCrucially, these reviews provide valuable labels that are used to train AI models and fine-tune LLMs. The dataset is available open source on the popular deep-learning platform HuggingFace. Just as AI and automation can be used to spread misinformation (Chang, 2023; Chang & Ferrara, 2022; Ferrara et al., 2020; Monaco & Woolley, 2022), it can also help combat \u201cfake news\u201d through human-AI collaboration.\n\nFindings\n\nFinding 1: The primary form of misinformation is narratives that attack international relations with the United States (henceforth referred to as US-skepticism), specifically referencing the economy, health policy, the threat of war through Ukraine, and other U.S. domestic issues.\n\nThe status quo between China and Taiwan is marked by Taiwan\u2019s self-identification as a sovereign state, which is in contrast to China\u2019s view of Taiwan as part of its territory under the \u201cOne China\u201d policy. As brief context, China has claimed Taiwan as its territory since 1949, but the United States has helped maintain the status quo and peace after the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950. After democratization in 1987, Taiwan\u2019s politics have been dominated by a clear blue-green division. The blue camp is led by Kuomintang (Nationalist Party, KMT hereafter), the founding party of the Republic of China (ROC, the formal name of Taiwan\u2019s government based on its constitution) who was defeated by the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and retreated to Taiwan in 1949. The green camp is led by the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which pursues revising the ROC Constitution and changing the country\u2019s name to Taiwan. The political cleavage between the blue and green camps is dictated by Taiwan\u2019s relationship with the PRC and the United States. The blue camp\u2019s position is that the PRC and ROC are under civil war but belong to the same Chinese nation, and thus the blue camp appreciates military support from the United States while enhancing economic and cultural cooperation with the PRC. The green camp believes that the necessary conditions for Taiwan to be free and independent are to stand firmly with the United States and maintain distance from the PRC. After 2020, the two major camps\u2019 insufficient attention to domestic and social issues caused the rise of nonpartisans and a third party, the Taiwan People\u2019s Party (TPP or the white camp), which strategically avoids discussing foreign policies. In the 2024 election, the ruling DPP party (green) was reelected with 40% of votes for the third consecutive presidency (from 2016 to 2028), while KMT (blue) and TPP (white) received 33% and 26% of votes, respectively.\n\nThe U.S. \u201cOne China\u201d policy since 1979 indicates that the United States opposes any change to the status quo unless it is solved peacefully. This has motivated the PRC to persuade Taiwanese citizens to support unification using misinformation targeted at China-friendly political groups, as the cost of unification would be greatly reduced if sufficient Taiwanese citizens opposed U.S. military intervention. This history between the United States and Taiwan serves as the foundation of US-skepticism. In the literature, US-skepticism in Taiwan is composed of two key psychological elements: trust and motivation (Wu & Lin, 2019; Wu, 2023). First, many Taiwanese no longer trust the United States after the United States switched diplomatic ties from Taiwan (ROC) to the PRC in 1979. Many blue-camp supporters doubt the commitment of the United States to send troops should China invade, per the Taiwan Relations Act (Wu & Lin, 2019). Second, Taiwanese citizens question Taiwan\u2019s role as a proxy in a potential war with China instead of sincerely protecting democracy and human rights in Taiwan (Wu, 2023).\n\nThe CoFacts dataset contains 140,314 articles submitted by Line users, which are then fact-checked by volunteers as rumor (47%), not a rumor (21%), not an article (19%), and opinion (13%). Here, rumor is synonymous with misinformation. Using the CoFacts dataset, we trained a BERTopic model to identify 34 forms of misinformation and then ranked them by their overlap with the word \u201celections\u201d in Mandarin Chinese (George & Sumathy, 2023; Nguyen et al., 2020).

Top misinformation narratives identified using BERTopic, then ranked by their salience to the 2024 Taiwanese presidential election.\n\nMany of these narratives are directly related to political parties or the democratic process. For instance, the highest-ranked topic is attacking the incumbent party (the DPP) at 18.1%, which contains 2,371 total posts. The subsequent misinformation topics focus on policy issues and specific narratives\u2014international relations, issues of marriage and birth rate, vaccines, nuclear energy, biometrics, egg imports, and the war in Ukraine. These are known cleavage issues and overlap with the eight central concerns during the election cycle\u2014economic prosperity, cross-strait affairs, wealth distribution, political corruption, national security, social reform/stability, and environmental protection (Achen & Wang, 2017; Achen & Wang, 2019; Chang & Fang, 2023).\n\nWe focus on the third type of misinformation, which is the relationship between Taiwan, the United States, and China. US-skepticism is not only the largest at 10,826 individual posts, but one flagged by journalists, policymakers, and politicians as one of the most crucial themes. This is a relatively new phenomenon in terms of proportion, which aims to sow distrust toward the United States (\u201cChina is flooding Taiwan with disinformation,\u201d 2023). In contrast, questioning the fairness of process (i.e. ballot numbers) and policy positions (i.e. gay marriage) are common during elections. However, US-skeptical misinformation diverges in that there is no explicit political candidate or party targeted. By sampling the topic articles within this category and validating using an LLM-summarizer through the ChatGPT API, we identified three specific narratives:\n\n(a) The United States and the threat of war: Ukraine intersects frequently in this topic, with videos of direct military actions. Example: \u201cDid you hear former USA military strategist Jack Keane say the Ukrainian war is an investment. The USA spends just $66,000,000,000 and can make Ukraine and Russia fight\u2026 Keane then mentions Taiwan is the same, where Taiwanese citizens are an \u2018investment\u2019 for Americans to fight a cheap war. The USA is cold and calculating, without any actual intent to help Taiwan!\u201d\n\n(b) Economic atrophy due to fiscal actions by the United States: These narratives focus on domestic policy issues in Taiwan such as minimum wage and housing costs. Example: \u201cThe USA printed 4 trillion dollars and bought stocks everywhere in the world, including Taiwan, and caused inflation and depressed wages. Be prepared!\u201d\n\n(c) Vaccine supply and the United States: While some narratives focus on the efficacy of vaccines, several describe the United States intentionally limiting supply during the pandemic. Example: \u201cTaiwanese Dr. Lin is a leading scientist at Moderna, yet sells domestically at $39 per two doses, $50 to Israel. Taiwan must bid at least $60! The United States clearly does not value Taiwan.\u201d\n\nThese narratives reveal a new element to US-skepticism: state capacity. As previously mentioned, state capacity is defined as whether a state is capable of mobilizing its resources to realize its goal. The Ukraine war and vaccine supply narratives both question the United States\u2019 motivations in foreign policies and perceived trustworthiness. Meanwhile, the economic atrophy narrative is based on the United States\u2019 domestic budgetary deficit and downstream impact on Taiwanese economy. These narratives frame U.S. state capacity as declining and imply that the United States could no longer realize any other commitment due to its lack of resources and capacity. The goal of such a narrative is to lower the Taiwanese audience\u2019s belief that the United States will help. But such a narrative does not include keywords of its target group (e.g., Taiwan) nor the PCR\u2019s goal (e.g., unification) and only works through framing and priming as an example of sharp power.\n\nThe specific focus of misinformation narratives related to the United States is composed of Ukraine (28.8%), the economy and fiscal policies (33.1%), technology (25.2%), and vaccine supply (9.9%). Misinformation related to state capacity takes up approximately 52.4%, more than half of all narratives (see Figure A1, part a in the Appendix). In all narratives, political parties are only referenced 27.8% of the time with the DPP the primary target (26.2%), which is almost half of the proportion for state capacity. China is only mentioned in tandem with the United States in 38.4% of the posts (see Figure A1, part b in the Appendix).\n\nFinding 2: Temporal and spatial evidence suggests VPN-based coordination, focused on U.S. issues and addresses.\n\nOnce we identified the top misinformation narratives using Line, we investigated information operations or coordination. Line is one of Taiwan\u2019s most popular communication apps featuring chatrooms (similar to WhatsApp), with 83% usage. One limitation of Line is that although we can analyze message content, Line chatrooms can be seen as conversations behind \u201cclosed doors\u201d\u2014platforms cannot impose content moderation and researchers have no access to the users themselves nor to the private chatroom in which users engage with misinformation (Chang et al., 2020). PTT, on the other hand, provides a public forum-like environment in which users can interact. Figure 1 shows the co-occurrence network of users who post comments under the same forum. Each circle (node) represents a user who posts on PTT. If two users make mutual comments on more than 200 posts, then they are connected (form a tie). Intuitively, this means if two users are connected or \u201cclose\u201d to each other by mutual connections, then they are likely coordinating or have extremely similar behaviors. The placement of the users reflects this and is determined by their connections.\n\nFigure 1. Co-occurrence network of PTT commenting users based on the posts, with at least 200 co-occurrences. Colors are determined through the Louvain community detection algorithm.\n\nUsing the Louvain algorithm (Traag, 2015), a common method to identify communities on social networks, five communities emerged from our dataset. Each community is colored separately, with clear clusters, except for teal which is more integrated. In particular, the yellow cluster is significantly separate from the others. This means they share significant activity amongst their own community, but less so with other communities. This suggests premeditated coordination rather than organic discussion, as the users would have to target the same post with high frequency. Prior studies have shown analyzing temporal patterns can provide insight into information operations. Specifically, overseas content farms often follow a regular cadence, posting content before peak hours in Taiwan on Twitter (Wang et al., 2020) and YouTube (Hsu & Lin, 2023).\n\nTo better understand the temporal dynamics on PTT, we plotted the distribution of posts and comments over a 24-hour period. Specifically, we focused on the top two countries by volume\u2014Taiwan and the United States. Figure 2, part a shows the time of posting. Taiwan\u2019s activity increases from 6 in the morning until it peaks at noon (when people are on lunch break), then steadily declines into the night. In contrast, posts from the United States peak at midnight and 8 a.m. Taipei time, which corresponds to around noon and 8 p.m. in New York, respectively. This provides an organic baseline as to when we might expect people to post.\n\nFigure 2. Temporal density of a) postings and b) comments. The coordinated group (green) represents the suspicious group from Figure 1 and has a sharp increase of activity at 10 a.m. sharp and a mixture of Taiwanese and US hours.\n\nHowever, in Figure 2, part b, while the distribution for Taiwan (blue) remains unchanged, the peak for the United States (orange) occurs at the same time as Taiwan. One explanation is that users are responding to posts in Taiwan. The second is that users in Asia\u2014potentially China\u2014are using a VPN to appear as if they are in the United States. This coincides with a report by Meta Platforms that found large numbers of CCP-operated Facebook accounts and subsequently removed them (Frenkel, 2023).\n\nThe more curious issue is when considering the activity of the yellow group from Figure 1, the temporal pattern (green) shows a sharp increase in activity at 10 a.m., which then coincides with both the peaks for Taiwan (12) and the United States (22). The sudden burst of activity is consistent with prior findings on content farms from China, where posting behavior occurs when content farm workers clock in regularly for work (Wang et al., 2020). While it is difficult to prove the authenticity of these accounts, the structural and temporal aspects suggest coordination. Figure A2 in the appendix shows further evidence of coordination through the frequency distribution of counts for co-occurring posts. For the US-based group, a distribution akin to a power law appears, commonly found within social systems (Adamic & Huberman, 2000; Chang et al., 2023; Clauset et al., 2009). In contrast, the coordinated group features a significantly heavier tail, with a secondary, \u201cunnatural,\u201d peak at around 15 co-occurrences.\n\nTo better understand the content of these groups, Table A1 shows the summary of comments of each group and the originating post, using a large-language model for abstractive summarization (see Methods). We report the top points for comments and posts in Table A1. The coordinated community focuses on businessman Terry Gou, who considered running as a blue-leaning independent. The comments attack the incumbent DPP and their stance toward foreign policy. One popular post features President Tsai\u2019s controversial meeting with Kevin McCarthy, then the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives. When a journalist asked McCarthy if he would \u201cinvite President Tsai to Congress\u2026 or\u2026 Washington,\u201d McCarthy replied, \u201cI don\u2019t have any invitation out there right now. Today we were able to meet her as she transits through America, I thought that was very productive.\u201d While this was positively framed, the title of the post itself was translated as \u201cMcCarthy will not invite Tsai to the United States\u201d (Doomdied, 2023). This takes on a common tactic in misinformation where statements are intentionally distorted to produce negative framings of a particular candidate.\n\nComments from U.S. IP addresses between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. focus on the potential alliance between the KMT and TPP. These posts are KMT-leaning with criticism toward both Lai and Ko, who are two oppositional candidates to the KMT. Some users argue that while the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is a negative force, the United States is not automatically a positive force, as the United States does not explicitly support Taiwan\u2019s international recognition or economic integration. In general, both posts and comments express that Taiwan should not rely too heavily on either China or the United States. This echoes the element of trust in the US-skepticism from the historical experience between ROC and the United States.\n\nBoth the U.S.-based and coordinated groups appear as blue-leaning audiences. What differentiates the first and second case is clear evidence of misinformation in the former through inaccurate framing. While US-skepticism may be a valid political stance, if the ambient information environment contains inaccurate information, then the democratic deliberative process is at risk. The case of US-skepticism is also one where stance and truth-value are often conflated, which may influence the process of voter deliberation.\n\nFinding 3: Misinformation is most common among pan-Blue and ROC identity groups on social media and is spread through visual media. These groups share themes with conspiracy groups in Western countries.\n\nLastly, we considered the groups in which misinformation is common and the way misinformation is delivered. To do so, we queried CrowdTangle using the titles and links from the CoFacts dataset specific to US-Taiwan relations. This yielded 4,632 posts from public groups. Table 2 shows the groups ranked by the total number of misinformation articles identified.\n\nThere are two themes to these groups. First, they are often pan-Blue media outlets (CTI News), politician support groups (Wang Yo-Zeng Support Group), and ROC national identity groups (I\u2019m an ROC Fan). The second type is somewhat unexpected but extremely interesting; it consists of groups that espouse freedom of speech (Support CTI News and Free Speech) and truth-seeking (Truth Engineering Taiwan Graduate School), topics often regarded as conspiracies. These topics are reminiscent of those in the West, such as the rhetoric around \u201cfake news\u201d and \u201ctruthers,\u201d and paint a transnational picture of how misinformation coalesces. The second largest group is Trump for the World, which supports a politician known to court conspiracy theory groups such as QAnon. These groups also serve as the \u201ccapacity\u201d element of US-skepticism, implying that the United States is in trouble for its domestic issues and is not a reliable partner to Taiwan. Furthermore, these groups have sizable followings\u2014ranging from 8,279 to 43,481.

Top public Facebook groups containing references to US-skepticism misinformation.\n\nLastly, we found that the majority of misinformation contains some form of multimedia, such as video (36%) or photos (15%), as shown in Figure 3, part a. Only 1% is a direct status. This may be due to CrowdTangle not surfacing results from normal users, but the ratio of multimedia to text is quite high. This aligns with extant studies showing the growth of multimodal misinformation (Micallef et al., 2022) and also user behavior in algorithm optimization (Chang et al., 2022; Dhanesh et al., 2022; Pulley, 2020)\u2014posts with multimedia tend to do better than posts with only text.\n\nMoreover, 47% contain a URL. Figure 3, part b shows one of the top domains containing misinformation (beyondnews852.com) after filtering out common domains such as YouTube. The site is named \u201cBeyond News Net\u201d and is visually formatted like a legitimate news site to increase the perceived credibility of information (Flanagin & Metzger, 2007; W\u00f6lker & Powell, 2021). The ability to rapidly generate legitimate-looking news sites as a tactic for misinformation may become a challenge for both media literacy and technical approaches to fight misinformation.\n\nFigure 3. Modalities of US-skeptical misinformation on Facebook public groups. Figure 3a shows the top modalities of misinformation. Figure 3b shows a popular template website that hosts misinformation (beyondnews852.com).\n\nMethods\n\nWe utilized three unique misinformation datasets\u2014Line, Facebook, and PTT\u2014with dates between 01/12/2023 and 11/10/2023. The CoFacts dataset includes 140,193 received messages, 96,432 that have been labeled as misinformation, facts, opinion, or not relevant. Of this, 41,564 entries are misinformation. The CoFacts dataset is not only methodologically useful but exemplifies a crowd-sourced approach to fact-checking misinformation as an actual platform intervention. Moreover, it is public and transparent, allowing for replicability. Using a subset of articles and posts containing misinformation, we trained a topic model using BERTopic (Grootendorst, 2022). On a high level, using BERTopic involves five steps: 1) extract embeddings using a sentence transformer, 2) reduce dimensionality, 3) cluster reduced embeddings, 4) tokenize topics, and 5) create topic representation.\n\nWe conducted several trials, experimenting with parameters such as different sentence transformer models and minimum cluster sizes for the HDBSCAN clustering algorithm. The model used to extract topics for this paper utilized paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2 for our sentence embedding model (Reimers & Gurevych, 2019), had a minimum cluster size of 80 for the clustering algorithm, and used tokenize_zh for our tokenizer. Our model yielded 34 topics. We also trained a model based on latent-Dirichlet allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003), but found the BERTopic results to be more interpretable. We then labeled all messages to indicate whether they included reference to the election or not, and ranked the topics by their election-related percentage to measure electoral salience. For our subsequent analysis, we focused on topic 3 (see Table 1), which captures general discourse about the relations between the United States, China, and Taiwan.\n\nThe Facebook dataset was extracted using CrowdTangle. We queried posts containing links and headlines from topic 3. We also cross-sectioned these links and headlines with a general election-based dataset with 911,510 posts. This yielded a total of 4,632 of posts shared on public Facebook groups and 227,125 engagements. Due to privacy concerns, it is not possible to obtain private posts from users on their own Facebook timelines, private groups, or messages. However, public groups are a good proxy for general discourse, in addition to providing ethnic or partisan affiliations via their group name (Chang & Fang, 2023). In other words, while CoFacts provides the misinformation narratives, Facebook public groups give insight into the targets of misinformation.\n\nLastly, we scraped PTT using Selenium. Commonly known as the Reddit of Taiwan, PTT is unique in that it contains the IP address of the poster, though this could be shrouded by proxy farms or VPNs. First, we scraped all posts that contained reference to the United States and the election, which yielded 22,576 posts and 1,983,396 comments, all with IP addresses, addresses provided by PTT, and the time of posting. We expanded the scope of this analysis as we were interested in the general discourse directly related to the United States, and the geospatial and temporal patterns that arose.\n\nDue to the large amount of data, there are three general approaches we could have taken\u2014local extractive summarization with LLMs, local abstractive summarization with LLMs, and server-based abstractive summarization (such as ChatGPT). Local extractive summarization is a method that embeds each of the input sentences and then outputs five of the most representative sentences. However, this approach is often too coarse, as it returns sentences with the highest centrality but does not summarize general themes across all the different comments or posts. On the other hand, abstractive summarization works by considering the entire context by ingesting many documents and then summarizing across them. This provides a more generalized characterization of key themes. However, the input size is the primary bottleneck as large-language models can only ingest so many tokens (or words), which also need to be held in memory\u2014the case for our project, as we are summarizing more than 10,000 posts.\n\nTo circumvent these issues, we sampled the maximum number of posts or comments that could fit within 16,000 tokens and then made a query call using the ChatGPT API. This provided a summary based on a probabilistic sample of the posts and comments.",

        "text": "US 2024 election: What to expect in Kentucky's primaries\nAll of Donald Trump's top opponents for the Republican nomination for president dropped out of the race weeks ago, but the whole gang will be back together on Kentucky's primary ballot Tuesday.\n\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis, former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie all suspended their campaigns after Kentucky finalized its ballot in January, as did pastor Ryan Binkley.\n\nTrump has easily won nearly every Republican contest so far, but Haley has won a significant number of votes in several recent primaries, including Maryland (20%) and Nebraska (18%) this week.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's opponents in Kentucky are author Marianne Williamson and U.S. Representative Dean Phillips. Democrats can also vote for \u201cuncommitted,\u201d which has attracted protest votes in other states.\n\nKentucky voters will also decide six primaries for the U.S. House. One race to watch is the 4th Congressional District Republican primary. Representative Thomas Massie, who backed DeSantis\u2019 presidential bid and co-sponsored a motion to remove House Speaker Mike Johnson, is facing a challenge from Eric Deters, a staunch Trump supporter. However, Deters hadn\u2019t reported raising any money as of the latest filing deadline and placed fourth in the 2023 gubernatorial primary.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at what to expect on Tuesday.\n\nPrimary day\n\nKentucky will hold presidential primaries and will also choose nominees for the U.S. House, the state legislature and the state Senate. Polls will close locally at 6 p.m. across the state. However, Kentucky is nearly cut in half by time zones; most of it falls in the Eastern time zone, while 41 counties in the western part of the state are on Central time.\n\nWho gets to vote\n\nKentucky has a closed primary system, which means that only voters registered with a political party may participate in that party\u2019s primary. Democrats may not vote in the Republican primary or vice versa. Independent or unaffiliated voters may not participate in either primary.\n\nDelegate allocation rules\n\nKentucky Republicans allocate their 46 delegates proportionally to any candidate who receives more than 15% of the vote, meaning any of Trump's opponents could qualify for delegates. They could also splinter the anti-Trump vote, increasing Trump\u2019s chances of being the only candidate to receive 15% of the vote and therefore the only candidate to receive any delegates.\n\nKentucky\u2019s 53 pledged Democratic delegates are allocated according to the national party\u2019s standard rules. Twelve at-large delegates are allocated in proportion to the statewide vote, as are six PLEO delegates, or \u201cparty leaders and elected officials.\u201d The state\u2019s six congressional districts have a combined 35 delegates at stake, which are allocated in proportion to the vote results in each district. Candidates must receive at least 15% of the statewide vote to qualify for any statewide delegates, and 15% of the vote in a congressional district to qualify for delegates in that district.\n\nDecision notes\n\nWhile Republican state parties that hold primaries this late in the cycle tend to embrace a winner-takes-all system for delegate allocation, Kentucky Republicans are dividing their delegates proportionally among candidates who receive at least 15% of the vote.\n\nFor signs that a candidate not named Trump could reach that 15% threshold, look to suburban areas like Louisville and Lexington. Those areas \u2014 Jefferson and Fayette counties \u2014 are also the biggest sources of GOP votes in the state.\n\nIn the 2020 presidential primary, \u201cuncommitted\u201d and Trump were the only two options on the Republican ballot. Statewide, \u201cuncommitted\u201d received 13% of the vote in the GOP primary. In Jefferson County, however, \u201cuncommitted\u201d received 23%.\n\nIn the 4th Congressional District \u2014 which runs along the Ohio River, sharing its northern boundary with Indiana and Ohio \u2014 the United Democracy Project, a group that has criticized Massie for his record on Israel, had spent $328,672 on the race as of last Tuesday. However, those ads have not supported an alternative candidate.\n\nThe AP does not make projections and will declare a winner only when it\u2019s determined there is no scenario that would allow the trailing candidates to close the gap. If a race has not been called, the AP will continue to cover any newsworthy developments, such as candidate concessions or declarations of victory. In doing so, the AP will make clear that it has not yet declared a winner and explain why.\n\nKentucky mandates a recount if the top candidate wins by less than 0.5 percentage point. However, that recount rule does not apply to the presidential race. Candidates can ask for a recanvass of the vote, which entails retabulating the vote totals, if the margin is less than 1 percentage point. However, to request a recount, in which each ballot is hand-counted, a court must approve and prescribe the procedure.\n\nWhat do turnout and the advance vote look like?\n\nAs of March 31, there were 3,487,292 registered voters in Kentucky. Of those voters, 43% were Democrats and 46% were Republicans.\n\nIn 2022, 17% of voters cast their ballots before Election Day.\n\nHow long does vote-counting usually take?\n\nIn the 2023 primary election, the AP first reported results at 6:03 p.m. Eastern time, or three minutes after the first polls closed. The election night tabulation ended at 9:56 p.m. with about 98% of total votes counted.\n\nAre we there yet?\n\nAs of Tuesday, there will be 168 days until the November general election.",

The former president has continuously said falsely that the 2020 election was stolen.\n\nThose claims spurred the 6 January 2021 insurrection, during which participants stormed the Capitol building as lawmakers were in the midst of certifying the election results. Trump is facing a variety of charges related to alleged election meddling.\n\nWhen asked by host Kristen Welker: \u201cWill you accept the election results of 2024, no matter what happens, senator?\u201d Rubio replied: \u201cNo matter what happens? No.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s an unfair election, I think it\u2019s going to be contested \u2026 by either side.\u201d\n\nWelker kept pushing Rubio to answer whether he would contest the results \u201cno matter who wins\u201d.\n\n\u201cWell, I think you\u2019re asking the wrong person,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cThe Democrats are the ones that have opposed every Republican victory since 2000, every single one.\u201d\n\nWelker repeatedly pointed out that Democrats who had issues with election results nevertheless conceded. Rubio, in turn, asked repeatedly whether Welker had asked Democrats this same question.\n\nRubio \u2013 who did certify the 2020 election results, and said on that day that \u201cdemocracy is held together by people\u2019s confidence in the election and their willingness to abide by its results\u201d \u2013 would not directly respond to whether Trump\u2019s unwillingness to accept election results served to undermine confidence in democracy.\n\nHe also refused to criticize Trump for his comments on Florida\u2019s six-week abortion ban, during which Trump called the law a \u201cterrible thing, a terrible mistake\u201d \u2013 despite also repeatedly claiming credit for overturning the federal protection for abortion.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Stakes \u2014 Presidential Transition Free newsletter We will guide you through the aftermath of the US election and the transition to a Trump presidency Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We are not like the Democrats where, unless you are in favor of their bills that basically say, \u2018Let\u2019s just put in all this fancy language, but it\u2019s not meaningful in terms of any restrictions.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe played coy about whether he would agree to be Trump\u2019s running mate in the 2024 presidential election, saying he had not discussed the possibility with Trump, but adding: \u201cI think anyone who\u2019s offered that job, to serve this country in the second highest office, assuming everything else in your life makes sense at that moment, if you\u2019re interested in serving the country, it\u2019s an incredible place to serve.\u201d",

        "text": "An obscure provision of Ohio law could keep Biden off the ballot in November \u2022 Ohio Capital Journal\nPresident Joe Biden might not appear on the November 2024 presidential ballot in Ohio. Ohio law requires that presidential candidates be certified \u2013 that is, the state must be notified that presidential candidates have been officially nominated \u2013 90 days before the general election in order to get on the ballot. That is the earliest deadline of any state.\n\nBut the Democratic National Convention that will formally nominate Biden won\u2019t open until nearly two weeks after Ohio\u2019s Aug. 7 deadline. The Republican National Convention will wrap up nearly three weeks before the deadline, so Donald Trump won\u2019t have a problem getting on the ballot.\n\nThe 90-day deadline has often caused trouble since its adoption in 2010. Only in 2016 did both parties\u2019 conventions take place before the Ohio cutoff date. Both conventions took place after the deadline in 2012 and 2020, and legislators extended the deadline both times. This is the first time that only one convention comes too late, but Republicans could well be affected in the future.\n\nThere are ways to resolve this problem, as two other states with early deadlines have already done. Washington state officials said they will accept a provisional certification of Biden\u2019s nomination before the convention. And Alabama\u2019s Legislature shortened its deadline so that Biden could qualify for the ballot there.\n\nNeither solution seems likely in Ohio, where Republicans may be seeking to make life harder for the Democrats\u2019 presidential nominee. The attorney general says the state can\u2019t accept a provisional certification. And the Legislature couldn\u2019t come up with a timely fix to the law.\n\nOhio laws generally take effect 90 days after passage. So a change to the deadline had to pass by May 9, but the Legislature wound up doing nothing. Here\u2019s how that played out.\n\nDivided GOP controls Statehouse\n\nRepublicans have supermajorities in both houses of the Ohio Legislature, yet they couldn\u2019t agree on how to proceed.\n\nThe Ohio Senate passed a bill, but only after adding what Democrats viewed as a poison pill that would have banned foreign nationals from contributing to campaigns for or against ballot measures. Republicans objected to a Swiss national\u2019s rumored contributions to a successful campaign last year in which voters approved a reproductive-rights amendment to the state constitution.\n\nThe House had planned to consider a different proposal but never voted on anything before leaving town on May 8 for two weeks.\n\nThis reflects the Ohio GOP\u2019s bitter divisions. The House speaker won his position with support from only a minority of his caucus. The Senate president will switch to the House next year because of term limits and has hinted he will challenge the speaker.\n\nThe Legislature could still pass an emergency law to change the deadline, but emergency laws require a two-thirds vote in both houses. The chances of that happening are uncertain at best.\n\nSo, Democrats might have to file a lawsuit to get Biden on the ballot.\n\nWhat\u2019s the precedent?\n\nAs a constitutional law scholar, I believe Democrats would have a strong argument that using an arbitrary and unusually long deadline to bar a major-party presidential candidate violates voting and associational rights under the First and 14th amendments. But success is not guaranteed.\n\nSuch a lawsuit would rely on two U.S. Supreme Court cases that rejected state efforts to bar presidential candidates from the ballot.\n\nA 1983 decision struck down Ohio\u2019s old law that required independent candidates to qualify more than six months before the election. And a March 2024 ruling rejected Colorado\u2019s effort to exclude former President Donald Trump from its primary ballot.\n\nThose cases may be helpful in making the Democrats\u2019 case, but they don\u2019t dictate a win. The 1983 decision overturned a law that treated independent presidential candidates much less favorably than party candidates. Ohio\u2019s 90-day deadline treats all candidates the same.\n\nAnd the Colorado case involved the state\u2019s unilateral determination that Trump was ineligible for office as an insurrectionist under the 14th Amendment. Ohio\u2019s 90-day rule says nothing about whether a candidate is constitutionally disqualified.\n\n\u2018Nobody seems to know why\u2019\n\nThose differences might not matter. Even if they do, a lawsuit still could win.\n\nOhio\u2019s 90-day deadline is not only arbitrary, I believe that it is irrational. Nobody seems to know why the state extended the deadline from 60 to 90 days in 2010. The change came in an obscure provision of a 341-page bill.\n\nThe 90-day deadline has been a problem in almost every presidential election since then. The Legislature waived the deadline in 2012 and 2020, when both parties\u2019 conventions fell after the cutoff date, and those elections ran smoothly. So the state can\u2019t justify sticking with the 90-day rule this year when only one party is holding its convention after the deadline.\n\nBiden probably won\u2019t carry Ohio in any event. But having both major-party candidates on the ballot is necessary for a fair presidential election.\n\nEveryone involved keeps saying that Biden will appear on the November ballot. But, at least for now, the law says otherwise.\n\nJonathan Entin, Professor Emeritus of Law and Adjunct Professor of Political Science, Case Western Reserve University\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

A wave of coups has washed across the Sahel and West Africa, leaving authoritarians in power in numerous countries. In addition, the continent has served as a stage for the escalating great-power competition between China, Russia, and the United States. U.S. engagement with Africa has long been deprioritized in Washington, with successive administrations devoting scant attention and resources to advancing democracy and resolving conflicts. Thus far, the Biden administration has maintained this pattern, which reflects the persistent tension between an interests-based and values-based U.S. foreign policy. Nevertheless, there are a few actions the United States can take to reinvigorate democracy and stabilize the region, such as emphasizing development and diplomacy over military responses and stepping up cooperation with allies and partners to reduce the influence of China and Russia.",

        "text": "Rethinking U.S. Africa Policy Amid Changing Geopolitical Realities\nOngoing instability in the Sahel \u2014 involving worsening insurgent violence, deepening great-power competition, and frequent coups \u2014 is exposing weaknesses in U.S. Africa policy.1 In fact, nearly four years into what U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres called an \u201cepidemic\u201d of coups,2 the United States and its closest Western allies and regional partners still lack a coherent and coordinated strategy to defend democracy in Africa without sacrificing security interests and geopolitical influence. Whether and how to engage with post-coup regimes in Africa exemplifies the enduring friction between a values-based and an interests-based U.S. foreign policy.\n\nWidespread democratic backsliding could have long-term and lasting geopolitical and security implications for the region and for the United States and its allies, who are quickly losing their influence on the continent. Historically, strategic priorities elsewhere have drawn Washington\u2019s attention away from Africa, resulting in minimal engagement with the region. As such, U.S. Africa strategy has not received the attention and resources needed to manage deteriorating political and security developments on the continent. America\u2019s current Africa policy is being overtaken by events and is ill suited to adequately address the coup pandemic. Years of counter-terrorism work on the continent are going by the wayside, along with strategic partnerships and relationships built over decades of evolving engagement, due to the coup pandemic and new state leaders being less willing to host Western counter-terrorism forces.\n\nIn this article, we outline what we see as the main challenge for U.S. Africa policy today \u2014 which we call the Africa policy trilemma, or the difficulty of simultaneously promoting democracy, combatting violent extremism, and engaging in great-power competition. This trilemma echoes Cold War dilemmas, but with counter-terrorism supplanting combatting local communist forces. We argue that Washington must learn from its mistakes during the Cold War, particularly the tendency to separate democracy promotion from security interests and sacrifice the former in the name of the latter. In an era of great-power competition with authoritarian rivals, the United States should bolster efforts to promote democracy and economic prosperity. Prioritizing more diplomacy and development could help to prevent the growing militarization of U.S. Africa policy seen in recent years.\n\nThis article proceeds in three sections. First, we review recent governance, security, and geopolitical developments across Africa. The second section examines the history of U.S. Africa policy and engagement related to democracy promotion, counter-terrorism, and great-power competition. We conclude with a number of policy recommendations the United States could adopt to reinvigorate Africa policy to better enable democratization in the future.\n\nDemocratic Decline in Africa\n\nAfrica has suffered more democratic decline than any other region of the world since 2020.\n\nFor a time, Africa appeared poised to become a showpiece for freedom\u2019s \u201cinevitable\u201d worldwide progression after the Cold War.3 In the first two decades after the Cold War, many African countries caught the third wave of democracy.4 From 1975 to 2014, the number of African countries democratizing exceeded those autocratizing, with the peak wave of democratization occurring in the early to mid-1990s.5 As a result, the share of African states that are \u201cclosed autocracies\u201d (the least democratic regime type, according to the Regimes of the World classification) fell from over 60 percent in 1988 to 11 percent by 2007. By contrast, whereas fewer than 4 percent of African countries could claim to be democracies in 1988, nearly 40 percent could by 2016.6\n\nIn recent years, however, an autocratic counter-wave has washed over Africa. According to the Sweden-based V-Dem project, democracy has suffered more in Africa than any other world region since 2020. The share of autocratizing countries in Africa rose from less than 5 percent in 2008 to over 30 percent in 2020, while the share of democratizing countries fell from 20 percent in 2014 to only 7 percent by 2020. Since 2020, there has been a marked decline of electoral democracies and a re-emergence of \u201cclosed autocracies,\u201d with the latter now ruling one-fifth of African states.7 By 2023, half of the continent\u2019s population lived under autocratic rule according to Freedom House, a Washington, DC\u2013based nonprofit group, while only 7 percent lived in \u201cfree\u201d countries.8\n\nDemocracy faces challenges across the continent, but the areas that have slid the most toward autocracy in recent years are northern Africa, the Sahel, and, to a lesser extent, western Africa. In 2023, the west and the south were the most democratic regions in Africa, with average electoral democracy scores around 0.5 on a scale of 0 to 1 (with 1 being the most democratic). By contrast, average electoral democracy scores were only 0.34 in central-east Africa, 0.29 in the Sahel, and 0.28 in northern Africa.9\n\nBetween 2013 and 2023, electoral democracy scores increased in 17 of Africa\u2019s 54 countries but declined in 37 countries. The biggest democratic declines over this decade were in Burkina Faso, which saw its electoral democracy score fall by 0.4, followed by Libya (-0.35), Tunisia (-0.29), Mauritius (-0.27), Niger (-0.24), and Comoros (-0.23). Coups in 2022 caused the declines in Burkina Faso, as did a July 2023 coup for Niger. Libya has been mired in civil war since the Arab Spring. Tunisia, the only democratic success story to emerge from the Arab Spring, saw those gains reversed since President Kais Saied\u2019s takeover in 2021.10 Flawed elections and corruption have characterized the more gradual democratic backsliding in Mauritius and Comoros.11\n\nDespite the rash of coups, support for democracy among the public remains high but has weakened.\n\nThe triggers for what Nigerian President Bola Tinubu called \u201cautocratic contagion\u201d in the Sahel and west Africa have been coups, which have made a comeback in Africa since 2020 after years of decline.12 According to the Colpus dataset, nine successful military coups have struck Africa since 2020.13 Of these, three toppled democratic governments \u2014 in Mali (2020), Burkina Faso (2022), and Niger (2023). Two coups were designed to ensure the survival of autocratic rule and block democratization \u2014 in Chad (2021) and Sudan (2021). Another two coups ousted autocrats \u2014 an aspiring autocrat in Guinea (2021) and an established one in Gabon (2023) \u2014 only to install new authoritarian regimes. Two more reflected splits among coup factions \u2014 in Mali (2021) and Burkina Faso (2022). There have been an additional five coup attempts in the region since 2020, including one in April 2023 that brought Sudan\u2019s rival coup factions to civil war.14\n\nSince 2020, virtually all coups have taken place within a so-called coup belt across the Sahel and west Africa. The August 2023 coup in Gabon was the lone exception (see figure 1). As The Economist recently noted, \u201cYou can now walk across nearly the widest part of Africa, from the Atlantic to the Red Sea, passing only through countries that have suffered coups in the past three years. But it would be unwise \u2014 you might well be kidnapped.\u201d15\n\nFigure 1: Geographic distribution of coups in Africa in 2020\u201323\n\nDespite the rash of coups, support for democracy among the public remains high but has weakened.16 According to Afrobarometer, an independent research network based in Ghana, nearly 70 percent of survey respondents across 34 African countries preferred democracy to any other system of government. Large majorities in most countries also still reject military and one-party rule across the continent \u2014 only in Burkina Faso do most respondents favor military rule.17 Yet support for democracy has dropped in some countries. For example, between 2014\u201315 and 2021\u201322, support for democracy fell by 36 percent in Mali, 26 percent in Burkina Faso, 21 percent in South Africa, and 15 percent in Guinea.18 Meanwhile, perceptions of corruption by elected officials and rising armed conflict have led opposition to military rule to soften in the region,19 especially among youth. In 2021\u201322, only 38 percent of Africans said they were satisfied with the way democracy works in their country, down from 46 percent in 2014\u201315.20\n\nPopular support for transparent elections remains strong across Africa. Three-quarters of respondents to Afrobarometer\u2019s 2021\u201323 survey believed elections were the best method for choosing state leaders. However, support for elections has fallen in some places over the past decade such as Tunisia and Burkina Faso. At present, only Lesotho lacks a solid majority that supports elections.21 National elections occurred in three African countries in the first four months of 2024 and are scheduled to occur in 11 more African countries over the rest of the year.22\n\nMeanwhile, none of Africa\u2019s new military juntas appear willing to relinquish power any time soon. In September 2023, for example, Mali\u2019s junta postponed the transitional presidential election scheduled for February 2024 due to unexplained \u201ctechnical reasons\u201d and also refused to hold legislative elections.23 Soon after, Ibrahim Traor\u00e9, the junta leader in Burkina Faso, said that holding elections in 2024 was \u201cnot a priority\u201d and that they would not be held until the security situation in the country had improved.24 As of May 2024, neither junta has committed to a timeframe for new presidential elections.25 Only in Chad did the authorities promise elections for 2024, but only after shepherding a new constitution allowing de facto President Mahamat Idriss D\u00e9by, who came to power through a military junta, to stand in those elections.26\n\nRising Violent Extremism and Islamist Terrorism\n\nThe 2020s have also witnessed rising violent extremism and Islamist terrorism in Africa.\n\nPolitical instability in the region is contributing to an already poor security situation. Half of all intra-state armed conflicts worldwide took place in Africa (26 of 52) in 2022.27 Two-fifths of the top 50 countries ranked in the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data 2024 Conflict Severity Index are in Africa,28 with the Sahel, Sudan, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo among the top ten conflicts appearing on the associated 2024 \u201cconflict watchlist.\u201d29 Overall, armed conflict violence has greatly increased in Africa since 2020, with fatalities more than quadrupling, from fewer than 25,000 to well over 100,000 across the continent in 2022. Armed conflict deaths in Africa now exceed levels last seen in the late 1990s and early 2000s during the height of the Second Congo War, which was the deadliest civil war since 1945.30\n\nFour of Africa\u2019s five deadliest ongoing armed conflicts \u2014 those with over 1,000 fatalities in 2022 \u2014 involved insurgencies by Islamist violent extremist organizations, namely the al-Qaeda\u2013aligned Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin in Mali and Burkina Faso, the Islamic State in Nigeria, and al-Shabaab in Somalia.31 While most civil wars in Africa in the 1990s involved ethno-linguistic cleavages, the last two decades have seen a rise of religiously framed civil war.32\n\nThe rising African death toll from 2020 to 2022 was due mainly to the outbreak of civil war in Ethiopia in 2020 and, since 2022, to insurgencies in Burkina Faso, Mali, and elsewhere.33 Armed conflicts involving groups associated with the Islamic State have spread across the region, emerging in Niger (2015), Nigeria (2015), Chad (2017), Burkina Faso (2019), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (2019), Mozambique (2019), Mali (2022), and Uganda (2022).34\n\nInstances of organized political violence in Africa have increased the most in recent years in Africa\u2019s post-2020 \u201ccoup belt\u201d: the Sahel. The number of political violence events in this region has risen from only a few hundred a year prior to 2012 to around 2,000 per year from 2013 to 2018, then increased steeply since 2019 to nearly 12,000 in the most recent 12 months to March 2024. Though central/eastern Africa also has seen major increases in political violence since 2012, only the Sahel has continued to see rising violence into 2024, according to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data conflict index.35 As a result, the epicenter of global terrorism \u201chas now conclusively shifted out of the Middle East and into the Central Sahel region,\u201d according to the Global Terrorism Index. Sub-Saharan Africa accounted for 47 percent of global terrorism deaths in 2023, more than South Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa combined. Five of the 10 countries most affected by terrorism in 2023 are in Africa: Burkina Faso (first place), Mali (third), Somalia (seventh), Nigeria (eighth), and Niger (tenth).36\n\nAlthough American policymakers had hoped to avoid the same fate as France, in part by \u201cplaying nice\u201d and cooperating with the juntas, this strategy appears to have largely failed by this spring.\n\nThe three most terrorism-afflicted countries in the Sahel \u2014 Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger \u2014 have also suffered coups since 2020. In each case, observers have argued that the incumbent government\u2019s inability to successfully tame their terrorism problem and safeguard national security was at least a contributing if not a driving factor in each coup.37 In all three countries, the newly installed juntas promised to prioritize restoring domestic security and order. Despite these promises, insurgencies in the Sahel have worsened following coups. Across the central Sahel, conflict fatalities from political violence increased 38 percent in 2023, and civilian fatalities grew 18 percent in 2022. More than 8,000 people were killed in Burkina Faso last year. In Niger, Islamic State Sahel Province forces have stepped up attacks since the coup in July 2023.38 In January 2024, Mali\u2019s junta withdrew from a peace agreement with separatists, which has spurred widespread violent attacks on civilians by government forces and Russia\u2019s Wagner group.39\n\nThe case of Sudan is even more instructive of the vicious cycle of coups, autocratization, and civil war. In 2019, a mass uprising by pro-democracy forces managed to trigger a military coup ousting Sudan\u2019s long-time dictator Omar Bashir. Hopes ran high for a democratic transition after continuing protests led the coupmakers to agree to a new constitution and transition timetable.40 A military coup in October 2021 blocked the promised transition to a civilian-led government. Subsequent infighting among security force elites for power within the military junta led to a failed coup attempt by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces against the Sudanese Armed Forces last April, which sparked a devastating civil war leading to at least 13,000 fatalities.41\n\nAs Africa has become a more important front in America\u2019s so-called global war on terror, governments in the region have sought greater security assistance from external powers. Initially, many turned to the United Nations, France, and the United States. The United States expanded its military presence and sought cooperative security partnerships in Africa. For example, in 2019, U.S. Air Base 201 in Niger, the drone base in Agadez that the United States built to the tune of $110 million, and Camp Baledogle, a Soviet-era air base the United States refurbished to support operations against al-Shabaab, both became operational to support regional counter-terrorism operations.42\n\nRecent political developments in the Sahel, enabled by coups and great-power competition, threaten U.S. counter-terrorism interests. Africa\u2019s new military juntas have sought to reduce their dependence on Western democracies and have sought counter-insurgency assistance and patronage from non-democratic actors like Russia\u2019s Wagner Group, recently rebranded as the Africa Corps, which is now directed by a Russian military intelligence unit.43 The latter has increasingly been relied upon to counter insurgency in Mali as French and U.N. peacekeeping forces have been forced to withdraw from the region.44 Although American policymakers had hoped to avoid the same fate as France, in part by \u201cplaying nice\u201d and cooperating with the juntas, this strategy appears to have largely failed by this spring. In March 2024, the junta in Niamey publicly revoked the military cooperation agreement with the United States and ordered U.S. troops to leave. After negotiations to stay failed, the Biden administration agreed to the request.45 By May 2024, even before U.S. troops had pulled out, Russian troops moved into U.S. Air Base 101 in Niamey.46 In April, the United States was also forced to withdraw dozens of troops based in N\u2019Djamena, which had deployed to Chad since 2021 as part of a U.S. special operations task force.47 U.S. Africa Command head Gen. Michael Langley warned that the loss of U.S. bases in the region will \u201cdegrade our ability to do active watching and warning, including for homeland defense.\u201d48\n\nIntensifying Great-Power Competition\n\nAfrica has become a major site of great-power competition. U.S. efforts to promote democracy and enhance security in Africa are complicated by rising regional great-power competition with China and Russia.49 This global competition pits liberal against authoritarian states with differing visions of international order.50 After the Cold War, linkage to and leverage of the democratic West were associated with greater advances for democracy, whereas weak Western leverage opened the door to \u201ccompetitive authoritarianism\u201d and democratic backsliding across the developing world.51 Now Africa\u2019s new juntas and would-be strongmen are seeking to rely on autocratic major power patrons for regime security. Russia and China, in turn, have an interest in making the world and region \u201csafe for autocracy.\u201d52\n\nRussia and China have cultivated friends and influence on the continent as part of a broader geopolitical struggle with the United States over power and influence in the developing world.53 Indeed, Africa may be a testing ground for the resilience of the liberal international order. For example, Gen. Laura Richardson, the commander of U.S. Southern Command, believes that rising competition with Russia and China in Africa may be a harbinger of things to come in the Western Hemisphere in the next five to seven years.54\n\nThe influence of powerful Western states is now contested or in decline across much of Africa. During the Cold War, France and the United Kingdom had predominant economic and military influence in their former colonies on the continent. However, China\u2019s exploding economic and diplomatic engagement in Africa in recent decades has enabled its influence on the continent to grow rapidly, in many cases now exceeding that of the former European colonial powers or the United States.55 For example, China surpassed the United States as Africa\u2019s largest trade partner in 2008. China\u2019s $300 billion in trade with Africa in 2023 was four times the U.S.-Africa trade. Similarly, French and U.S. outward investment in Africa dwarfed China\u2019s until 2017, but since then China has become the largest source of investment on the African continent.56 As a result, China has more leverage to potentially subvert democracy or prop up autocrats in Africa.57\n\nThe influence of France \u2014 America\u2019s closest external partner on the continent in recent decades \u2014 in Francophone Africa is now in freefall. France\u2019s condemnation of coups led to diplomatic fallouts with the new juntas in Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger. These three countries created the Alliance of Sahel States, a mutual defense pact, in September 2023.58 In August 2022, the last of several thousand French troops withdrew from Mali, marking the end of Operation Barkhane, a decade-long counter-insurgency campaign.59 In February 2023, France withdrew its troops from Burkina Faso.60 On Sept. 27, 2023, two months after Niger\u2019s coup, France agreed to withdraw its ambassador and 1,500 troops.61 France has been forced to shift the base of its counter-insurgency operations in Africa to Chad.62 In December 2023, Mali and Niger revoked tax cooperation treaties with France.63 In April, Burkina Faso expelled French diplomats.64\n\nRussia has capitalized on anti-French sentiment and French withdrawals in the Sahel.65 The new Sahel alliance \u2014 Africa\u2019s new \u201choly alliance\u201d \u2014 is poised to become \u201ca vehicle for Russian influence in the heart of Africa.\u201d66 Russia\u2019s Africa policy has emphasized military engagement, drawing from its historical role as one of the largest arms suppliers to Africa. Since 2018, Russia has also deployed private military contractors to 31 African countries.67 The most prominent of these is the Wagner Group, which moved into the Central African Republic in 2018 and expanded its presence across Africa in subsequent years.68 In return for a \u201cregime survival package,\u201d the Wagner Group \u2014 recently rebranded the Africa Corps or Expeditionary Corps \u2014 is seeking access to strategically important natural resources such as timber, gold, uranium, and lithium.69 In May 2023, only months after expelling French troops, Burkina Faso\u2019s military leaders hailed Russia as a strategic ally.70 Last December, Russia re-opened its embassy in Burkina Faso, which was shuttered in 1992.71 Moscow also struck a new military cooperation deal with Niger. In April 2024, 100 instructors from the Africa Corps arrived in Niger.72 Africa Corps personnel reportedly hope to take over the U.S. base in Agadez, which U.S. troops must now vacate.73\n\nThe rise of Russian and Chinese influence and decline of democracy in the region over the last decade are mutually reinforcing.\n\nUnlike Russia, China has focused on economic engagement in Africa \u2014 like it has elsewhere \u2014 and funding infrastructure development through its Belt and Road Initiative. China\u2019s investment and aid without attaching conditions such as political and economic reforms \u2014 unlike some powerful Western countries \u2014 have attracted many African leaders who have come to resent what is perceived as Western meddling in internal affairs.74 Beijing may also have greater ambitions for military engagement and security cooperation on the continent.75 China opened its first overseas military base in Djibouti in 2017 and seeks another base in west Africa on the Atlantic coast.76 China has deployed private security contractors in 15 African states since 2018.77 China has been ambivalent toward the coup trend in Africa and has sought to reinforce its existing influence.78 In response to the 2017 coup that ousted Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, for example, Chinese President Xi Jinping backed Emmerson Mnangagwa, invited him to Beijing for a state visit in April 2018, and increased investment in Zimbabwe.79 China also seeks to promote its norms and values through professional military education in Africa.80\n\nThe rise of Russian and Chinese influence and decline of democracy in the region over the last decade are mutually reinforcing.81 The number of disinformation campaigns in the region quadrupled from 2022 to 2023, with foreign state sponsors led by Russia and China responsible for most. Russia alone has sponsored disinformation to undermine democracy in 19 African states, more often than not with the Wagner Group directly involved. For example, Russian networks \u201chelped prime and promote\u201d the coups in Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger, whose new military juntas have in turn also become major sponsors of disinformation in west Africa.82 China\u2019s propaganda in Africa likewise perpetuates anti-U.S. and anti-democratic narratives.83\n\nAssessing the Evolution of U.S. Africa Policy\n\nHistorically, American engagement with Africa has been episodic because Africa has never been seen as strategically important.84 The U.S. State Department only established a separate regional bureau for Africa in 1958.85 During the first half of the Cold War, U.S. Africa policy was one of minimal economic and military engagement aimed at avoiding major commitments in the region.86 In the latter Cold War from the mid-1970s, Africa received relatively more attention from U.S. policymakers (but not necessarily more resources) as U.S.-Soviet struggles for political influence intensified across the Global South. North Africa, and Egypt in particular, garnered the highest priority as they were seen as more relevant to the more strategically important Middle East.87 For example, after the Camp David Accords in 1979, Egypt became a top recipient of U.S. foreign aid. Egypt\u2019s special status is also reflected in the fact that it is the only African state included under the U.S. Central Command theater covering the greater Middle East since the 1980s. By contrast, U.S. attention and commitments in sub-Saharan Africa have always lagged behind. Only six U.S. presidents since World War II have ever made official state visits to sub-Saharan Africa, the first being Jimmy Carter in 1978 and the last being Barack Obama in 2015.88\n\nThroughout the Cold War, as in other regions, U.S. Africa policy focused on great-power competition \u2014 namely, containing Soviet and communist influence. Fear of Soviet encroachment animated American interventions in Africa.89 For example, after the Soviets and Cubans backed left-wing forces in the Angolan civil war, Washington backed right-wing National Union for the Total Independence of Angola rebels.90 Likewise, after the Soviet Union backed Ethiopia in the Ogaden War in 1977\u201378, the United States seized the opportunity to gain Somalia as an ally. In exchange for access to military bases, the United States gave aid to President Siad Barre and turned a blind eye to the dictator\u2019s human rights abuses.91 America\u2019s security interests in Africa were limited, with Libya\u2019s state sponsorship of terrorism a nuisance. Democracy promotion was never a central U.S. objective in Africa during the Cold War.92\n\nWith the collapse of the Soviet Union and end of the Cold War great-power competition, the United States pursued constructive but modest efforts at democracy promotion and conflict resolution in Africa, with mixed success in the 1990s. U.S. diplomacy played a supporting role in the peaceful end of apartheid in South Africa.93 Though the Clinton administration created the U.S. Agency for International Development\u2019s Office of Transition Initiatives in 1994 with a mission to support peace and democracy in Angola and elsewhere,94 a shrinking U.S. foreign aid budget meant only modest investment in democracy aid.95 Meanwhile, humanitarian interventions were marked by failure in Somalia and inaction in Rwanda, leading the United States to stand on the sidelines of Africa\u2019s civil wars.96 In 1998, to signal U.S. commitment, President Bill Clinton became the first U.S. president since Carter to visit sub-Saharan Africa.97 Clinton\u2019s signature regional economic policy, the African Growth and Opportunity Act, has expanded duty-free access to the United States from Africa since 2000.98\n\nAfter the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, U.S. Africa policy increasingly focused on counter-terrorism with Africa a theater of the global war on terror. In 2002, the United States gained its first and only permanent military base in Africa, Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti. In 2007, building on existing regional counter-terror programs,99 the United States created Africa Command, the first new geographic combatant command since standing up Central Command in the 1980s.100 The Bush administration also more than tripled U.S. economic aid to sub-Saharan Africa from $2.25 billion in 2001 to $7.6 billion by 2008. Support for aid increases was based in part on the notion that underdevelopment increased the risk of state collapse and the emergence of Islamic extremist groups such as al-Shabaab. Bush also argued that increased humanitarian aid for Africa was a moral imperative.101 Much of the new aid commitments were for the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief program and a new Millennium Challenge Account to reward poor countries with good governance.102 Unlike during the Cold War, when most aid went to North Africa, the biggest foreign aid increases were in sub-Saharan Africa and the Sahel. Still, largely preoccupied with the U.S.-led wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Bush administration did little to directly intervene in Africa\u2019s conflicts, including in Darfur and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, instead preferring to let U.N. peacekeepers take the lead.\n\nMany observers hoped the inauguration of America\u2019s first black president would signal a new era of U.S.-Africa relations.103 However, the Obama years were characterized by plateaued levels of aid and attention to the region as the administration sought to address fiscal pressures while making Asia a strategic priority for the United States.104 Despite this, the Bush-era trend of growing U.S. military presence in Africa continued, as reflected in the growing numbers of troops and advisors, status of forces agreements, and temporary bases.105 Yet little progress was made in countering violent extremism as deepening military engagement in Africa was not matched by investments in diplomacy, development, or democracy promotion.106\n\nBiden sought to give a new tone to Africa policy, replacing Trump\u2019s transactional \u201cAmerica First\u201d diplomacy with the promise of \u201cmutually respectful relations.\u201d\n\nIn 2017 and 2018, after a period of continuity in Africa policy punctuated by a few diplomatic blunders, great-power competition with China and Russia became more central to the Trump administration\u2019s Africa strategy.107 In December 2018, National Security Advisor John Bolton unveiled \u201cProsper Africa,\u201d a new initiative aimed at competing with the perceived growing Chinese and Russian influence in the region.108 The plan promised to double flagging U.S.-Africa trade and investment and compete with Chinese Belt and Road Initiative investments.109 In 2019, the U.S. International Development Finance Cooperation was established to drive private investment in the developing world, especially Africa.110 But without adequate funding, the reality never matched the ambitious rhetoric of \u201cProsper Africa.\u201d111 By the end of his term, Trump tried to limit Washington\u2019s footprint on the continent, both economically and militarily. He \u201cpared back efforts to fight jihadis in Cameroon, Niger, and Nigeria\u201d and in December 2020 ordered U.S. troops to withdraw from Somalia.112 As a result, by 2021, official U.S. troop levels in Africa \u2014 which had peaked at just over 5,000 in 2017 \u2014 had fallen to pre-9/11 era levels of closer to 1,200\u20131,300 troops in 2019 and 2020.\n\nUpon coming to office, the Biden administration did not prioritize Africa, though in a 2020 Foreign Affairs article, Biden said that \u201cwe need to do more to integrate our friends in Latin America and Africa into the broader network of democracies and to seize opportunities for cooperation in those regions.\u201d113 Biden sought to give a new tone to Africa policy, replacing Trump\u2019s transactional \u201cAmerica First\u201d diplomacy with the promise of \u201cmutually respectful relations.\u201d To that end, Biden lifted Trump\u2019s Muslim travel ban, which affected many African countries.114 In May 2022, at the request of the Pentagon, Biden reversed Trump\u2019s December 2020 order and authorized hundreds of special operations forces to redeploy to Somalia.115 In December 2022, Biden convened the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit in Washington, where he announced more humanitarian aid for the region116 and several new initiatives, including a \u201c21st Partnership for African Security\u201d and \u201cAfrican Democratic and Political Transitions\u201d initiative.117 The summit\u2019s agenda has framed Biden\u2019s Africa policy ever since. Late in 2022, the Biden administration named Ambassador Johnnie Carson as a new special presidential representative for U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit implementation.118 Nevertheless, there has been no major increase in overall U.S. foreign aid to Africa in the Biden years.119\n\nThe Need for Actionable U.S. Policy\n\nThe Biden administration still lacks a coherent and robust strategy for promoting democracy, countering violent extremism, and competing with China and Russia in Africa.\n\nIn August 2022, the Biden administration published the \u201cU.S. Strategy Toward Sub-Saharan Africa.\u201d120 It identified four objectives of U.S. strategy in the region: foster openness and open societies, deliver democratic and security dividends, advance pandemic recovery and economic opportunity, and support conservation, climate adaptation, and energy transition. Rhetorically, the strategy calls \u201ccontinuity\u201d in Africa policy as insufficient. It claims to \u201creframe the region\u2019s importance to U.S. national security interests.\u201d One reason for Africa\u2019s heightened importance is China and Russia\u2019s use of the region \u201cto challenge the rules-based international order.\u201d In addition, the strategy notes growing economic interests, with the African Continental Free Trade Area set to make Africa one of the largest free trade areas in the world (and make Africa the fifth largest economy in the world). We agree with much of the strategy\u2019s rhetoric. The question, of course, is how to translate such lofty principles into actionable policy.\n\nIn a September 2023 speech at the U.N. General Assembly, Biden spoke about the need to defend democracy around the world, especially in west Africa. The United States, Biden said, stands \u201cwith the African Union and ECOWAS [the Economic Community of West African States] and other regional bodies to support constitutional rule. We will not retreat from the values that make us strong. We will defend democracy.\u201d121 This echoed the 2022 National Security Strategy\u2019s emphasis on \u201cdemocratic competition,\u201d or efforts to defend democracy and help democracies demonstrate the superiority of the democratic way of life over autocratic alternatives.122\n\nIn practice, the Biden administration\u2019s expressed commitment to democratic values in Africa has been in tension with interests-based foreign policy goals, including countering violent extremism. For example, in September 2023, Washington struck a short-lived deal with Niger\u2019s new military junta \u2014 which, last July, toppled Mohamed Bazoum\u2019s democratically elected government123 \u2014 to resume operations from the U.S. drone base at Agadez.124 Though failure to quickly declare and oppose anti-democratic coups undermines U.S. credentials as a reliable patron of democracy,125 the United States hesitated triggering cuts in military aid and training critical to countering terror in the Sahel, so Washington did not acknowledge a coup had taken place in Niger until October 2023.126 The gap between Biden\u2019s rhetoric and initial U.S. reaction to Niger\u2019s coup reflects an enduring perceived trade-off that the United States faces in confronting democratic backsliding in the region. The developments in Niger also indicate that Washington\u2019s current approach is not working. In March 2024, Niamey revoked the status of forces agreement with the United States and ordered American troops to leave, potentially creating a vacuum Russia and China want to fill.\n\nBeyond Niger, U.S. Africa policy now faces a trilemma of promoting democracy and combatting terrorism while simultaneously competing with authoritarian rivals for geopolitical influence. Washington aspires to do all three efforts well but can effectively only do two things at any given time. As geopolitical competition intensifies, the United States faces resistance that it last encountered during the Cold War, when it also had an uneven track record of defending democracy. We now see a reinvigorated Cold War\u2013era debate over whether Washington should practice double standards for illiberal regimes in Africa that may share security or geopolitical interests with the United States.127 During the Cold War, this meant tolerating right-wing dictatorships whose collapse might empower communists. At present, the concern is similar, as not tolerating friendly dictatorships might undermine U.S. security interests or empower anti-American forces.\n\nBut without a roadmap or clear set of principles, U.S. policymakers are reacting ad hoc to each coup.\n\nBiden\u2019s 2022 Africa strategy says relatively little about how to promote democracy or deter and reverse coups in the region. On the one hand, it says that the United States will condemn coups (historically, it has not) and incorporate human rights abuses by security forces into bilateral talks. The strategy also says the United States will use both positive inducements and punitive measures such as sanctions. But without a roadmap or clear set of principles, U.S. policymakers are reacting ad hoc to each coup. The result is hesitation, paralysis, and inconsistency \u2014 the United States has only \u201ccalled a coup a coup\u201d half of the time since 2009.128 For example, although coup leaders from Sudan, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Guinea were denied invitations to attend the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit in December 2022, Mahamat D\u00e9by, who seized power in Chad in April 2021, was invited.\n\nRevitalizing and Recalibrating U.S. Policy\n\nU.S. Africa policy needs to be revitalized and recalibrated to respond to the spreading post-2020 coup pandemic head on because doing so makes the region safer for democracy and more stable \u2014 regardless of who occupies the Oval Office.\n\nWashington should at long last shed the habit of giving Africa short shrift in terms of attention and resources. Wars in Ukraine and Gaza understandably occupy much policymaker attention. But the United States should not ignore the fate of democracy or security developments in Africa. In a world of transnational security threats, African insecurity also threatens U.S. security interests. Terrorist threats to American citizens have often emanated from Africa, from the time Osama bin Laden set up al-Qaeda\u2019s operations in Sudan in 1992 (until 1996)129 to the 1998 twin embassy bombings that killed a dozen Americans (and 200 Africans) to today, when al-Qaeda and Islamic State\u2013linked groups are spread throughout the continent and kill or kidnap Americans for ransom.130 In 2020, al-Shabaab attacked a Kenyan military base, killing a U.S. servicemember and two U.S. government contractors.131 Even more alarming is the arrest of an al-Shabaab member taking flight lessons in the Philippines who was, according to the Department of Justice, \u201cconspiring to hijack aircraft in order to conduct a 9/11-style attack in the United States\u201d \u2014 illustrating there is a transnational threat from at least one group on the continent.132\n\nThe United States also cannot sit idly by while an onslaught of coups in Africa chips away at democratization, generates chaos and instability, and creates new opportunities for unrest that America\u2019s rivals have shown they know how to exploit. For example, terrorist attacks rose 30 percent in the aftermath of the 2021 coup in Mali, after the new government turned to Wagner for security assistance and ordered the French and the U.N. to leave the country, greatly limiting Washington\u2019s ability to provide support.133 One observer claims that Wagner\u2019s presence in Mali \u201chas strengthened and energized jihadi groups, providing them with not only a recruitment tool, but a much more favorable operating environment in Mali.\u201d134 This development could happen in other places where Russia\u2019s presence and influence are on the rise.\n\nThe Biden administration says that Africa is a priority, but its actions suggest otherwise. While the United States has not lost all of its influence in Africa, failing to truly prioritize the region to compete with Russia and China could risk undermining U.S. values and interests. To compete effectively will require sustained engagement, more fiscal resources, and a rebalanced Africa strategy that reduces the yawning gap between rhetorical commitment to democracy and America\u2019s tepid response to coups.\n\nThere are no easy or quick solutions to the Africa policy trilemma, but hard choices need to be made and priorities set and clarified.135 The reality of the last four years suggests a more assertive and deliberate strategy is needed in countries where the United States is still welcome. In short, the United States should find more ways to demonstrate to its African partners, and the African people, that Washington is a dependable democratic advocate and preferred security partner. Here are four policy ideas to that end.\n\nFirst, prioritize engaging friendly African partners and democracies, especially in the littorals.\n\nThe United States should focus on increasing engagement with the littoral countries of Benin, Togo, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, and Ghana as well as Cameroon and Nigeria. Many of the littoral nations in west Africa have seen attacks by Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wa al-Muslimeen and the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara in their northern regions \u2014 with Cote d\u2019Ivoire being the site of a major al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb attack in 2016.136 Historically, the United States has had good relationships with these countries, and they are probably open to increased military cooperation. In fact, Washington is presently exploring options for drone basing in the littorals.137 At the same time, Russia is trying to deepen its military ties in this region with countries that are still friendly to Washington;138 Washington needs to prioritize and expedite engaging with these nations to maintain its relevancy as a security partner and defender of democracy in the region.\n\nCameroon and Nigeria have been fighting violent extremist organizations for close to two decades. Security cooperation between the United States and Nigeria came to a head in 2014 over concerns about human rights abuses. However, with its huge population, large economy, and plentiful natural resources, Nigeria\u2019s importance on the continent is apparent.139 Washington should continue to improve these relationships.140 Moscow is currently in talks with Abuja about how to deepen bilateral cooperation.141 But all of these countries are still open to U.S. engagement, and Washington can prove to its regional partners that it is still serious about providing security assistance and intensifying engagement. In short, Washington should try to contain democratic backsliding and Russian and Chinese influence from expanding farther beyond the Sahel into the littorals and neighboring countries.\n\nSecond, rebalance the \u201c3Ds\u201d of democracy, defense, and diplomacy. Maintain investment in defense cooperation while increasing investment in development and democracy in the region.\n\nWhile Washington claims to take a comprehensive approach to Africa, balancing development, diplomacy, and defense,142 the tripod of the \u201cthree Ds\u201d is out of balance. America\u2019s Africa policy is too passive and lacks sufficient investment in development and diplomacy. There remain clear benefits to continued defense cooperation across Africa,143 including supporting diplomatic efforts to deepen Washington\u2019s relationships on the ground. Defense cooperation should remain an important part of U.S. strategy on the continent. However, now more than ever, Washington needs to expand diplomatic and development tools of statecraft to better curb the coup pandemic, nudge military juntas to quickly restore democratic rule, improve partnerships, and protect African and U.S. interests. A heightened focus on development, investment,144 trade, education, strengthening democratic institutions, and supporting free and fair elections should accompany existing military engagement. Where to focus these efforts? Start in countries under threat by violent extremist organizations \u2014 which have yet to turn to Russia for support.\n\nOn the diplomatic front, one sensible place to start would be for the U.S. president to visit Africa \u2014 as Biden promised but failed to do in 2023.145 The bare minimum next step should be to fill remaining vacancies in the State Department\u2019s key ambassadorial posts. Biden\u2019s nominee for ambassador to the African Union, Stephanie S. Sullivan, has not been confirmed despite being nominated nearly two years ago.146 The special envoy for the Sahel position is also vacant, and filling it should be a priority. The United States has recently named Tom Perriello as a new special envoy for Sudan.147 Yet Washington still lacks a high-level regional point person for strengthening democratic institutions.148 Without a coordinated regional diplomatic effort being run out of the State Department with the full public support of the White House, America\u2019s anti-coup diplomacy has been hampered. A higher-level special envoy focused on rolling back recent coups and preventing future coups by strengthening democracy and weakening the tolerance for coups is needed. The envoy should be empowered to engage in regional shuttle diplomacy and give the United States a more central role coordinating regional anti-coup diplomacy with regional partners, embassies, and regional international organizations such as the Economic Community of West African States and the African Union.\n\nWhile these are worthy aid initiatives, they should be better funded to seriously compete with Russia and China.\n\nRegarding economic statecraft, growing fiscal constraints and polarization in the U.S. Congress make a large-scale development initiative for Africa akin to the Marshall Plan politically if not fiscally infeasible in the near term.149 Biden\u2019s 2024 budget included about $8 billion for Africa, roughly the same as over the past decade.150 What could be politically possible are more moderate increases in aid given more strategically to promote democratic development and counter Russian and Chinese influence, both multilaterally with select partners and bilaterally by scaling up funding for the Millennium Challenge Corporation and the State Department\u2019s Human Rights Democracy Fund for Africa.151 In August 2023, as part of the supplemental appropriations request for Ukraine aid, the Biden administration asked for $200 million for a \u201cCountering Russian Malign Actors in Africa Fund\u201d to bolster aid in countries vulnerable to Russian influence. Just this spring, that request was pared back to only $25 million in Biden\u2019s fiscal year 2025 budget proposal. Biden\u2019s request also includes $400 million for a \u201cCountering the People\u2019s Republic of China Influence Fund\u201d and funds for a Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, echoing Trump\u2019s \u201cProsper Africa\u201d to compete with China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative.152 While these are worthy aid initiatives, they should be better funded to seriously compete with Russia and China.\n\nThird, develop a playbook for consistently navigating coup responses.\n\nThe primary tools used to counter recent coups \u2014 limited Economic Community of West African States sanctions and suspended African Union memberships \u2014 are not working.153 In January 2024, Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger all announced they were leaving the Economic Community of West African States.154 With the recent decline of anti-coup norms,155 coup plotters today recognize \u201cthe West is no longer the only game in town.\u201d156 They see a more permissive environment to make coups stick. Given the presence of other external patrons, U.S. sanctions alone probably will not work. The only way to change coup makers\u2019 cost-benefit calculus short of military intervention is to invest in more active diplomacy and economic assistance tied to democratic progress.\n\nA new U.S. approach should focus on creating positive incentives for military juntas to quickly return to democratic rule. In the immediate wake of a coup, the United States needs to quickly declare it, not ignore it. Prior research has shown that the credible threat of strong international responses can make coups rarer and pressure post-coup military juntas to restore civilian rule quickly.157 Greater flexibility in response is needed to reduce incentives for rhetorical hedging by U.S. policymakers. A more flexible coup response policy would, depending on facts on the ground, proscribe some but not all forms of aid and cooperation (such as democracy aid).158\n\nIn the medium term, credible offers of greater economic or military aid for restoring democratic rule quickly could help incentivize coup leaders to establish transitional governments sooner. Democratic donors must coordinate so that such aid offers that are conditional on democratic progress are still attractive despite competing offers of aid from Russia and China. To ensure the United States and its allies are not training the next generation of coup leaders,159 military engagement must shift \u201caway from the delivery of tactical weapons and towards a \u2018governance-first\u2019 policy that leads with support for institution building aimed at fostering civilian control and responsible use.\u201d160\n\nLong term, America\u2019s goal should be to offer credible commitments to carrots for democratization, which at the same time do not drive coup regimes to seek support from Russia or China. Rather than just a strategy of containment, Washington should consider a Kennedy-style \u201calliance for progress.\u201d After the Cuban revolution, the United States sought to neutralize the appeal of communist revolution by bolstering non-communist states with more development aid.161 We propose a similar non-militarized strategy to counter autocracy in Africa today.\n\nFourth, coordinate more closely with Western allies and regional partners.\n\nWashington should do more with its close Western partners on the continent, including coordinating funding aid and investment packages to counter Russia and China. Since 2013, Washington has worked closely with Paris in the Sahel to provide transport, aerial refueling, and intelligence.162 Washington should coordinate more with France so future agreements enable continued work toward shared geopolitical and security objectives \u2014 at least in the countries that have not rejected France and could benefit from additional assistance like the littorals, Cameroon, and Nigeria. Washington should also seek to cooperate with the United Kingdom and other close Western allies who share an interest in regional stability and countering authoritarian regimes and could be cajoled to take a deeper interest in the continent. For example, Britain has slashed aid to Africa in recent years.163 The United States should advocate such cuts be reversed as part of a concerted effort to restore Western linkage and leverage. Washington can work with European allies to bypass hostile juntas and support African civil society.164\n\nConclusion\n\nAmidst the ongoing coup pandemic and shifting geopolitical landscape, U.S. Africa policy needs a paradigm shift to center democratic competition and more consistently and better support democracies. The United States should find new ways of demonstrating to its African partners, and the African people, that Washington is a dependable and preferred partner. Rather than sacrifice democracy in the name of other strategic interests, as the United States was prone to do during the Cold War, Washington now needs to commit to the defense of democracy as the default means of competing with authoritarian major power rivals across the Global South and Africa.\n\nJohn Chin is an assistant teaching professor of political science in the Carnegie Mellon Institute for Strategy and Technology at Carnegie Mellon University.

        "text": "Trump or Biden? Either way, US seems poised to preserve heavy tariffs on imports\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 As president, Donald Trump imposed a 25% tariff on foreign steel, which hurt Clips & Clamps Industries, a Michigan auto supplier \u2014 raising its materials prices, making it harder to compete with overseas rivals and costing it several contracts.\n\nJeff Aznavorian, the company president, thought he might enjoy some relief once Joe Biden entered the White House. Instead, Biden largely preserved Trump\u2019s tariffs \u2014 on steel, aluminum and a mass of goods from China.\n\n\u201cIt was a little surprising that an ideologically different administration would keep the policies so intact,\u2019\u2019 Aznavorian said, recalling how a previous Democratic president, Bill Clinton, had fought for freer trade. \u201cThat\u2019s just so different from a 2024 Biden administration.\u2019\u2019\n\nTrump and Biden agree on essentially nothing, from taxes and climate change to immigration and regulation. Yet on trade policy, the two presumptive presidential nominees have embraced surprisingly similar approaches. Which means that whether Biden or Trump wins the presidency, the United States seems poised to maintain a protectionist trade policy \u2014 a policy that experts say could feed inflation pressures.\n\nLast week, in fact, Biden announced some new tariffs, on Chinese electric vehicles, advanced batteries, solar cells and other products, that he said would keep Beijing from flooding the United States with cheap imports.\n\nThe protectionist tilt of the two presidential contenders reflects the widespread view that opening the nation to more imports \u2014 especially from China \u2014 wiped out American manufacturing jobs and shuttered factories. It\u2019s an especially potent political topic in the Midwestern industrial states that will likely decide who wins the White House.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the election, it\u2019s obvious,\u2019\u2019 said William Reinsch, a former trade official now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cWhere are the deciding states? Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin \u2014 right there, you can see that trade is going to have an outsize role.\u2019\u2019\n\nIn their own ways, the two candidates have ditched a U.S. commitment to relatively frictionless trade \u2014 low barriers and scant government interference \u2014 that were a bedrock of American policy for decades after World War II. The idea was that free trade would hold down costs and aid consumers and businesses across the world.\n\nIn recent years, though, the perception grew that while free trade benefited households and companies, it hurt workers, with American jobs falling victim to cheaper foreign labor.\n\n\u201cThe once nearly unanimous Washington consensus on free trade is dead,\u201d Robert Lighthizer, who was Trump\u2019s lead trade negotiator, crowed in his 2023 book, \u201cNo Trade Is Free.\u2019\u2019\n\nYet like free trade, trade protectionism carries its own economic price. It can raise costs for households and businesses just as the nation is struggling to fully tame inflation. It tends to prop up inefficient companies. It spurs retaliation from other nations against American exporters. And it typically sours relations with allies and adversaries alike.\n\nTrump, who brazenly labeled himself \u201cTariff Man,\u2019\u2019 tried to pummel America\u2019s trading partners with import taxes, vowing to shrink America\u2019s trade deficits, especially with China.\n\nHe did pressure Mexico and Canada into rewriting a North American trade deal that Trump insisted had destroyed U.S. manufacturing jobs. He also persuaded China to agree to buy more American farm goods. But his efforts didn\u2019t revive the manufacturing base \u2014 factory jobs make up a smaller share of U.S. employment than they did before his presidency \u2014 or shrink America\u2019s trade deficits.\n\nTrump has vowed more of the same in a second term. He\u2019s threatening to impose a 10% tariff on all imports \u2014 and a 60% tax on Chinese goods.\n\n\u201cI call it a ring around the country,\u2019\u2019 Trump said in an interview with Time magazine.\n\nMark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, warns that the consequences would be damaging. Trump\u2019s tariff plans, Zandi said, \u201cwould spark higher inflation, reduce GDP and jobs and increase unemployment, all else equal.\u201d\n\nA year after the import taxes were imposed, Zandi estimates, average consumer prices would be 0.7 percentage points higher than they would otherwise be. A report out Monday, from Kimberly Clausing and Mary Lovely of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, estimates that for families in the middle of the U.S. income distribution, Trump\u2019s tariff proposals would amount to a tax of at least $1,700 a year.\n\nFor his part, Biden favors subsidizing such key industries as chipmaking and EV manufacturing to give them a competitive edge. It\u2019s a stance that reflects worry that China\u2019s rising military and technological might imperils America\u2019s national security. As last week\u2019s announcement showed, Biden isn\u2019t averse to new tariffs, either. His top trade negotiator, Katherine Tai, has opened an investigation into Chinese trade practices in the shipbuilding industry, likely a prelude to imposing further sanctions on Beijing.\n\n\u201cThe laissez-faire economic model of trade wasn\u2019t working for the United States,\u2019\u2019 said Elizabeth Baltzan, a senior adviser to Tai. \u201cWe want to correct for that. The measures you take in order to get a fairer (economy) may involve measures that could be labeled protectionist. But I think you have to ask what you\u2019re protecting\u201d \u2014 notably working-class communities.\n\nDani Rodrik, a Harvard economist who was an early critic of the globalization of the 1990s and 2000s, views Biden trade policies more favorably than he does Trump\u2019s approach.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s was knee-jerk and incoherent; there is little evidence that his trade restrictions on China did any good to workers or the middle class in the U.S.,\u2019\u2019 Rodrik said.\n\nBy contrast, he said, \u201cBiden\u2019s approach is strategic and based on rebuilding U.S. manufacturing capacity and investing in the green transition, so fundamentally strengthening the U.S. economy rather than crass protectionism.\u201d\n\nEither way, a consensus formed in recent years that U.S. trade policy had to change. Moving factories to low-wage countries like Mexico and China in the 1990s and early 2000s, critics say, fattened corporate profits and enriched executives and investors but devastated American factory towns that couldn\u2019t compete with cheap imports.\n\nDavid Autor, a leading economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and two colleagues concluded in a 2016 paper that from 1999 to 2011, cheap Chinese imports wiped out 2.4 million American jobs.\n\nMore recently, China\u2019s rise as America\u2019s No. 1 geopolitical rival has created a bipartisan effort to reduce America\u2019s reliance on Beijing for supplies of everything from pharmaceuticals to \u201crare earth\u2019\u2019 minerals for electric cars and cellphones.\n\nThough this sea change in policy may have started with Trump, discontent with free trade and with an increasingly combative China had been building for years. One of Trump\u2019s first presidential acts was to dump a free trade agreement the Obama administration had negotiated with 11 Pacific Rim countries.\n\nThen Trump really got going. He imposed taxes on foreign washing machines and solar panels. Next, he labeled steel and aluminum imports a threat to national security and hit them with tariffs.\n\nFinally, he started perhaps the biggest trade war since the 1930s: He hammered $360 billion of Chinese products with tariffs for Beijing\u2019s efforts to surpass U.S. technological supremacy through illicit tactics, including cybertheft. China lashed back with retaliatory taxes of its own: It targeted American farmers, in particular, to try to hurt Trump\u2019s constituency in rural America.\n\nDid Trump\u2019s tariff war achieve anything?\n\nA study by Autor and colleagues at the University of Zurich, Harvard and the World Bank concluded that Trump\u2019s import taxes failed in their goal to return jobs to the American heartland. The tariffs, the study found, \u201cneither raised nor lowered U.S. employment\u2019\u2019 where they were supposed to protect jobs.\n\nWorse, the retaliatory taxes imposed by China and other nations on U.S. goods had \u201cnegative employment impacts,\u2019\u2019 especially for farmers. These were only partly offset by billions in government aid that Trump bestowed on farmers to cushion their pain.\n\nThe Trump tariffs also damaged companies that relied on supplies that were affected by the tariffs. In Plymouth, Michigan, Clips & Clamps doesn\u2019t even use much imported steel. Yet it was still hurt by the tariffs because they allowed American steel producers to raise their prices.\n\n\u201cOur raw material prices here in the United States tend to be 20% higher than Europe and Mexico and 40% to 60% higher than China,\u2019\u2019 Aznavorian said. His overseas rivals, he said, enjoy \u201csignificantly cheaper\u2019\u2019 costs.\n\nIf Trump\u2019s trade war fizzled as policy, though, it succeeded as politics. Autor\u2019s study found that support for Trump and Republicans running for Congress rose in the areas most exposed to the import tariffs \u2014 the industrial Midwest and manufacturing-heavy Southern states like North Carolina and Tennessee.\n\nAfter entering office, Biden retained many of Trump\u2019s trade policies and made no effort to revive Obama\u2019s old Pacific Rim trade pact. He kept Trump\u2019s steel and aluminum tariffs, while letting some trading partners avoid it until they reached a quota. He also retained China tariffs. Biden even turned up the heat on Beijing by restricting its access to advanced computer chips and the equipment to make them.\n\n\u201cTrade and national security have been combined into one thing,\u2019\u2019 Reinsch said. \u201cThis is the first time we\u2019ve had an adversary that posed both an economic and a security challenge. The Soviet Union was a security challenge, but it was never an economic threat. Japan was an economic threat in the \u201980s, but it was never a security threat; they were an ally. China is both, and it\u2019s been complicated trying to figure out how to deal with that.\u2019\u2019\n\nBiden\u2019s China policies are \u201cgrounded in national security,\u2019\u2019 said Peterson\u2019s Lovely. \u201cThat makes it harder to critique because national security is always this black box that only those with the highest security clearance get to see.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe Biden administration has rankled some U.S. allies by offering subsidies to encourage U.S. companies to manufacture goods in America. Under Biden\u2019s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, for instance, auto buyers can receive a $7,500 tax credit for purchasing an electric vehicle. But the credit applies only to EVs assembled in North America. And the full credit goes only to EVs in which at least 60% of battery parts are made in North America and 50% of the \u201ccritical minerals\u2019\u2019 used in the vehicle \u2014 like cobalt, copper and lithium \u2014 come from the United States or a country with which the U.S. has a free trade deal.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that the United States develop its own clean energy sector, in collaboration with its allies and partners, thereby not becoming dependent on Chinese technologies,\u2019' said Wendy Cutler, a former U.S. trade negotiator who is vice president of the Asia Society Policy Institute. \u201cWhen trade is increasingly being weaponized, it\u2019s important that the U.S. does not become overly dependent on China for strategic products.\u2019\u2019\n\nBiden\u2019s initiatives \u2014 including incentives to produce green technology and computer chips in the United States \u2014 have spurred what looks like a surge of investment in manufacturing. Karen Dynan of the Peterson Institute has reported that investment in U.S. factories surged at an 80% annual rate in the January-March period compared with the final three months of 2023, helping fuel the economy\u2019s unexpectedly strong performance.\n\nThe United States seems unlikely to reverse its tilt toward protectionism anytime soon. China, struggling to revive its own economy, is trying to export its way out of trouble, threatening to overwhelm world markets with cheap EVs and other products.\n\nAs for Aznavorian, he hopes the U.S. mends trade relations with its allies.\n\n\u201cWe need friendly trade partners in order to compete against China,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nYet when it comes to China and other U.S. adversaries, Aznavorian said, he\u2019s convinced that protectionist trade policies are \u201cdefinitely here to stay.\u2019\u2019",

        "text": "\u2018No equivalence\u2019: Biden defends Israel after ICC requests arrest warrants\nUS president insists Israel and Hamas cannot be compared after ICC seeks warrants over alleged Israeli war crimes.\n\n\u2018What\u2019s happening is not genocide\u2019 says Biden after ICC seeks warrants\n\nUnited States President Joe Biden has defended Israel against war crimes charges in the world\u2019s top courts.\n\nBiden\u2019s remarks came after Karim Khan, the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC), said he was seeking arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Minister of Defence Yoav Gallant over alleged war crimes committed during the war in Gaza.\n\n\u201cLet me be clear, we reject the ICC\u2019s application for arrest warrants against Israeli leaders,\u201d Biden said at a Jewish American Heritage Month event at the White House on Monday, the same day Khan announced he was applying for the arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant, as well as Hamas leaders over alleged war crimes.\n\n\u201cThere is no equivalence between Israel and Hamas,\u201d Biden added. Hours earlier, he had issued a strongly-worded statement saying that the ICC warrants were \u201coutrageous\u201d.\n\nIsrael is also facing a separate case on alleged genocide at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which was brought by South Africa.\n\nBiden said that Israel is not committing genocide in Gaza.\n\n\u201cContrary to allegations against Israel made by the International Court of Justice (ICJ), what\u2019s happening in Gaza is not genocide. We reject that,\u201d Biden said in his speech.\n\nIn January, the ICJ ruled there was a plausible risk of genocide in Gaza, ordering Israel to take a series of provisional measures, including preventing any genocidal acts from taking place.\n\nWhile Biden\u2019s defence of Israel was met with warm applause at the White House event, his election campaign has been marred by pro-Palestinian protests across the US, with some antiwar advocates labelling the president \u201cGenocide Joe\u201d.\n\nPanel of experts\n\nThe ICC prosecutor outlined specific charges against Netanyahu and Gallant, including \u201cstarvation of civilians as a method of warfare\u201d and \u201cextermination\u201d, although he said his full investigation was ongoing.\n\nKhan also applied for arrest warrants for three Hamas leaders \u2013 Yahya Sinwar, Mohammed Diab Ibrahim al-Masri (also known as Deif) and Ismail Haniyeh \u2013 for war crimes and crimes against humanity, including extermination and murder, the taking of captives, torture, rape and other acts of sexual violence.\n\nThe charges were supported by evidence prepared by a panel of experts that included international human rights lawyer Amal Clooney.\n\nIn a statement issued on the report prepared by the experts, Clooney wrote, \u201cI do not accept that any conflict should be beyond the reach of the law, nor that any perpetrator should be above the law.\u201d\n\nSome US Republican lawmakers were even more forceful in their criticism of the ICC prosecuting Israel on Monday.\n\n\u201cMy colleagues and I look forward to make sure neither Khan, his associates nor their families will ever set foot again in the United States,\u201d Republican Senator Tom Cotton wrote on X.\n\nThe ICC is the world\u2019s first permanent international war crimes court and its 124 member states are obliged to immediately arrest the wanted person if they are on a member state\u2019s territory.\n\nThe US is not a member of the ICC and its \u201cbiggest leverage\u201d could be to pressure its allies \u2013 mostly European nations which are signatories to the ICC \u2013 to not act on the warrants, said Al Jazeera\u2019s Heidi Zhou-Castro, reporting from Washington, DC.\n\nIsrael is not a member of the ICC. Nor are China and Russia.\n\nInternational reactions to the ICC prosecutor\u2019s plan to issue arrest warrants have been mixed.\n\nIn comments delivered to the United Nations Security Council, Switzerland\u2019s UN envoy Pascale Baeriswyl said his country \u201cfully supports the court and stresses the importance of respecting its independence\u201d.\n\nThe ICC issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin in March 2023 over alleged war crimes in Ukraine, but Monday\u2019s step marked the first time the court has sought to intervene in the conflict in the Middle East.",

        "text": "Election deniers moving closer to GOP mainstream, report shows, as Trump allies fill Congress\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 In the hours after the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, Ohio\u2019s then-Republican senator, Rob Portman, voted to accept President Joe Biden\u2019s win over the defeated former president, Donald Trump, despite Trump\u2019s false allegations that Biden only won because of fraud.\n\nBut as Trump charges toward his rematch with Biden in 2024, Portman has been replaced by Sen. JD Vance, a potential vice presidential pick who has echoed Trump\u2019s false claims of fraud and said he\u2019ll accept the results this fall only \u201cif it\u2019s a free and fair election.\u201d\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Tim Scott and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, other possible VP picks, also declined to object to Biden\u2019s victory over Trump, but have been less committal this year. Rubio said recently if \u201cthings are wrong\u201d with November\u2019s election, Republicans won\u2019t stand by and accept the outcome.\n\nAnd the new speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, helped organize Trump\u2019s failed legal challenge to Biden\u2019s win. He demurred when asked if he believed the 2020 election was legitimate during an event with other Trump allies about the upcoming election.\n\nAs Trump makes a comeback bid to return to power, Republicans in Congress have become even more likely to cast doubts on Biden\u2019s victory or deny it was legitimate, a political turnaround that allows his false claims of fraud to linger and lays the groundwork to potentially challenge the results in 2024.\n\nWhat to know about Trump\u2019s second term:\n\nStaffing the administration: Here are the people Trump has picked recess appointments Follow all of our coverage as Donald Trump assembles his second administration.\n\nA new report released Tuesday by States United Action, a group that tracks election deniers, said nearly one-third of the lawmakers in Congress supported in some way Trump\u2019s bid to overturn the 2020 results or otherwise cast doubt on the reliability of elections. Several more are hoping to join them, running for election this year to the House and Senate.\n\n\u201cThe public should have a real healthy dose of concern about the real risk of having people in power who\u2019ve shown they\u2019re not willing to respect the will of the people,\u201d said Lizzie Ulmer of States United Action.\n\nThe issue is particularly stark for Congress given its constitutional role as the final arbiter of the validity of a presidential election. It counts the results from the Electoral College, as it set out to do on Jan. 6, 2021, a date now etched in history because of the violent assault on the U.S. Capitol by a pro-Trump mob.\n\nIn its report, States United found that in Congress, 170 representatives and senators out of 535 lawmakers overall can be categorized as election deniers. Heading into the fall elections, two new Senate candidates and 17 new House candidates already are on the ballot this fall seeking to join them.\n\nIt\u2019s not just Congress that has been seeded with people who supported trying to overturn Trump\u2019s 2020 loss, but the highest ranks of the Republican Party.\n\n\u201cThis is deeply alarming,\u201d said Wendy Weiser, the vice president for democracy programs at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University. \u201cA democracy can only function if the participants commit to accepting the results of popular elections. That is it. That\u2019s the entire political system.\u201d\n\nThe former president picked Michael Whatley, who has echoed Trump\u2019s election lies, to become co-chairman of the Republican National Committee, with his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump. Christina Bobb, who was recently indicted for her alleged involvement in a scheme to recruit fake electors in Arizona, has been named the RNC\u2019s head of \u201celection integrity.\u201d\n\nUnder Trump\u2019s direction, the RNC is making the elections process its top priority, bringing in the new personnel and adding resources, said Danielle Alvarez, an adviser to both the Trump campaign and the party committee.\n\nRioters loyal to President Donald Trump rally at the U.S. Capitol in Washington on Jan. 6, 2021.

Recounts, audits and reviews in the battleground states where he contested his loss all affirmed Biden\u2019s victory, and courts rejected dozens of lawsuits filed by Trump and his allies.\n\nStates United\u2019s report details how successful election deniers have been in bolstering their congressional ranks. It examines the results of congressional party primaries in the 13 states that have held them this year and found that in each state, at least one election denier has made it to the general election for a House or Senate seat.\n\nThe report defines election deniers as people who falsely claimed Trump won in 2020, spread misinformation about that election or took steps to overturn it, or refused to concede a separate race. It finds that at least 67 will be on the ballot in the House in November, including 50 incumbents. Three will be running for the Senate \u2014 one of whom, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, is an incumbent.\n\nThere have been high-profile losses among election deniers, as well. Last week in West Virginia, Republican Rep. Carol Miller, who also voted against accepting Biden\u2019s victory, successfully fended off a primary challenge from Derrick Evans, who was convicted of a felony civil disorder charge after storming the Capitol on Jan. 6. Numerous election deniers in 2022 lost bids for swing state offices such as governor or secretary of state that would have given them direct power over voting in 2024.\n\nStill, the movement has grown by dominating Republican primaries. In the race for the nomination to challenge Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown in Ohio, businessman Bernie Moreno, who has previously said Trump was \u201cright\u201d to call 2020 \u201cstolen,\u201d won his primary. In Indiana, Republican Sen. Mike Braun voted to certify Biden\u2019s win, but he will step down this year to run for governor and is poised to be replaced by Rep. Jim Banks, a prominent election denier who easily won the GOP primary in that state.\n\nThe report classifies neither Rubio or Scott as election deniers, but skepticism about the trustworthiness of voting has become an organizing GOP principle, particularly for the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.\n\nBefore becoming the House speaker, Johnson recruited colleagues to support a lawsuit, which ultimately failed, filed by Trump\u2019s allies to overturn his 2020 loss.\n\nMore recently Johnson met with Trump at the former president\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort to shore up his own political support amid a far-right rebellion seeking to oust him as speaker. He emerged promising House legislation that would be designed to stop immigrants in the country illegally from voting.\n\nDuring a press conference on the Capitol steps to announce the bill, the speaker acknowledged it\u2019s hard to prove that certain immigrants are wrongfully casting ballots. Election experts say it is extremely rare for immigrants who are ineligible to vote to break federal law to do so.\n\nWhile Congress passed legislation putting in safeguards to better protect against interference after the Capitol attack, it\u2019s lawmakers who will ultimately be asked to accept the 2024 results from their states.\n\nVance stood by his recent remarks. And Rubio said he expects there will be lawsuits in jurisdictions where the final tallies are close, as sometimes happens.\n\n\u201cWhen people ask me, \u2018Are you going to accept the outcome?\u2019 I think what some people are arguing is if there\u2019s things wrong with this election, we\u2019re going to point it out,\u201d Rubio said in a short interview.\n\n___\n\nRiccardi reported from Denver.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to fix the spelling of the last name of the States United spokeswoman, Lizzie Ulmer.",

This is a problem of today,\" said John Cohen, the former intelligence chief at the Department of Homeland Security, and now an ABC News contributor. \"Foreign and domestic threat actors have fully embraced the internet, and they are increasingly using advanced computing capabilities like artificial intelligence to conduct their illegal operations.\"\n\nAlready, those attempting to target elections have done so \"by conducting cyber-enabled hack-and-leak campaigns, voice spoofing, online disinformation campaigns, and threatening or plotting attacks against symbols of the US elections,\" the bulletin said.\n\nAnd now, the analysis warns, the innovative abilities of generative AI can be used against future elections.Those tools can be exploited \"to confuse or overwhelm voters and election staff to disrupt their duties\" by creating or sharing \"altered\" or deepfaked pictures, videos or audio clips \"regarding the details of Election Day, such as claiming that a polling station is closed or that polling times have changed, or to generate or promote other tailored false information online.\"\n\nIn this June 28, 2019, file photo the Department of Homeland Security seal is seen during a news conference in Washington. Carolyn Kaster/AP, FILE\n\nOn the eve of the New Hampshire primary in January, a robocall seeming to impersonate the voice of President Joe Biden circulated, encouraging recipients of the call to \"save your vote\" for the November general election, rather than participate in the state's primary, according to audio obtained at the time by ABC News.\n\nThat \"generative AI-created audio message\" was specifically flagged in the DHS analysis, which also noted \"the timing of election-specific AI-generated media can be just as critical as the content itself, as it may take time to counter-message or debunk the false content permeating online.\"\n\n\"This may be one of the most difficult elections for Americans to navigate finding ground truth in our lifetimes,\" said Elizabeth Neumann, a DHS assistant secretary during the first years of Donald Trump's presidency, and now an ABC News contributor. \"It's not just whether a politician is telling you the truth, but you won't even be able to trust your own eyes at the images you're seeing in your social media feeds, in your email and possibly even traditional media, if they don't do a good enough job vetting the material.\"\n\nThe 2024 race has been marked by increasingly toxic rhetoric, and the intermingling of inflammatory campaign trail hyperbole and courtroom theatrics, as Trump faces four criminal cases in which he maintains his innocence. Hate speech, misinformation and disinformation are running rampant on social media and in real life -- even as rapidly evolving technology remains vulnerable, experts said. Meanwhile, wars in the Middle East and Ukraine continue overseas, dividing Americans' views on foreign policy, with the conflicts rippling out in protests at major U.S. college campuses from coast to coast.\n\n\"Threat actors can attempt to exploit deepfake videos, audio content, or other generative AI media to amplify discontent,\" the DHS analysis said. \"A well-timed deepfake or piece of AI-generated media for a targeted audience could spur individuals to take action that may result in violence or physical disruptions directed toward the elections or candidates.\"\n\nThe threat landscape has grown \"more diverse and more complex,\" and protecting the integrity of U.S. elections faces more challenges than ever due to the accelerating sophistication of artificial intelligence, top intelligence officials told lawmakers last Wednesday.\n\n\"Using every tool we have is critical as the challenge is expanding,\" Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines told a Senate committee holding a hearing focused on threats to the 2024 elections. \"There are an increasing number of foreign actors, including non-state entities who are looking to engage in election influence activities,\" she said, adding \"relevant emerging technologies, particularly generative AI and big data analytics, are increasing the threat by enabling the proliferation of influence actors who can conduct targeted campaigns.\"\n\nDirector of National Intelligence Avril Haines testifies before a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on worldwide threats, at Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., May 2, 2024. Craig Hudson/Reuters\n\n\"Innovations in AI have enabled foreign influence actors to produce seemingly authentic and tailored messaging more efficiently, at greater scale,\" Haines added. \"Even as the threat landscape is becoming increasingly complicated, it is my view that the U.S. government has never been better prepared to address the challenge,\" in part thanks to lessons learned from the 2016 presidential election.\n\nAuthorities at every level need to be ready to defend against artificial intelligence disseminating fake news at this delicate moment, experts said.\n\n\"One of the most important things we need to be doing now is educating and preparing the public. Because they will be the people who are being targeted with this content -- the public is the intended target -- and the objective is to influence how people behave,\" Cohen said.\n\n\"State and local officials need to have a plan, so that when this content is detected, they can use trusted sources of communication to counteract and correct inaccurate information. Once that content hits, it's going to spread across the online media ecosystem rapidly, and has to be counteracted immediately,\" Cohen added. \"Law enforcement and our security community have been slow to adapt to this rapidly evolving threat environment. We're still using the strategies of yesterday to deal with a threat of today. In a way, it's bringing a knife to a gunfight.\"",

        "text": "Iran\u2019s president has died in office. Here\u2019s what happens next\nEditor\u2019s Note: A version of this story appears in CNN\u2019s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region\u2019s biggest stories. Sign up here.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nOnce seen as a likely successor to Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader, President Ebrahim Raisi has died in office, leaving the Islamic Republic\u2019s hardline establishment facing an uncertain future.\n\nAn ultraconservative president, 63-year-old Raisi was killed Sunday, along with Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian and other high-ranking officials, in a helicopter crash in Iran\u2019s remote northwest. Their death comes at a delicate time for a country that faces unprecedented challenges at home and from abroad.\n\nThe Islamic Republic\u2019s economy remains crippled by American sanctions, its young population is becoming growingly restive, and the country faces increasingly belligerent adversaries in the Middle East and beyond.\n\nRaisi\u2019s death will \u201ctrigger elections at a time when the IRI (Islamic Republic of Iran) is at the nadir of its legitimacy and zenith of its exclusionary policies,\u201d Ali Vaez, Iran Project Director at the International Crisis Group think tank, said on X.\n\nHere\u2019s what comes next.\n\nIran's First Vice President Mohammad Mokhber speaks during Iran's government cabinet on Monday in Tehran, Iran. Iran's Presidency/WANA/Reuters\n\nWho steps in as president?\n\nPower has now been transferred to Mohammad Mokhber, who had served as Raisi\u2019s vice president and was on Monday approved as acting president by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the final arbiter of domestic and foreign affairs in the Islamic Republic.\n\nNot as well known as Raisi, Mokhber is \u201canother administrator,\u201d Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa program at the Chatham House think tank in London, told CNN\u2019s Becky Anderson. \u201cHe is close to the IRGC, close to the levers of power,\u201d Vakil said, adding that he is likely to present a model of \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d in the coming days.\n\nBut the country must, by law, hold elections within the next 50 days. On Monday, Iranian state news IRNA said Iran\u2019s presidential elections will take place Friday, June 28. Candidates can register from May 30 to June 3, and campaigning will run from June 12 until the morning of June 27, it added.\n\nExperts say that the elections are likely to be hastily organized, with poor voter participation. In March, Iran recorded its lowest electoral turnout since the Islamic Republic\u2019s founding in 1979, despite government efforts to rally voters ahead of the ballot.\n\nThat vote \u2014 for seats in the parliament, or Majles, and the 88-member Assembly of Experts, which is tasked with picking the Supreme Leader \u2014 brought in mostly hardline politicians.\n\n\u201cThe population has by and large lost faith in the idea that change can come through the ballot box,\u201d Trita Parsi, co-founder and Executive Vice President of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft in Washington, DC, wrote Sunday on X.\n\nRescue team members work at the scene of the helicopter crash carrying Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi in Varzaghan, in northwestern Iran on Monday. Azin Haghighi/Moj News Agency/AP\n\nThe March election also barred more moderate politicians from running \u2014 including former President Hassan Rouhani, once a regime stalwart \u2014 tightening the small circle of hardliners to continue the Supreme Leader\u2019s conservative rule after he dies.\n\n\u201cReal alternatives to Iran\u2019s hardliners have simply not been allowed to stand for office in the last few elections,\u201d Parsi said on X, adding that \u201cthose alternatives have in the eyes of the majority of the population lost credibility anyways, due to the failure to deliver change.\u201d\n\nUntil the Supreme Leader is replaced, however, little change is expected to follow Raisi\u2019s death, particularly on foreign policy.\n\n\u201cIt is really the Supreme Leader and the Revolutionary Guards who make the final decisions, and even in the region mostly implement Iran\u2019s regional policy,\u201d Vaez said, adding that \u201coverall we will see more continuity than change.\u201d\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN reporter details transition of power in Iran following fatal crash 01:07 - Source: CNN\n\nWhat are the longer-term implications of Raisi\u2019s death?\n\nRaisi\u2019s death has raised questions about who will eventually succeed Iran\u2019s 85-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the most powerful man in the country.\n\nThe Iranian clerical establishment had invested heavily in Raisi during his presidency, seeing him as a potential successor to Khamenei. Observers say he had been groomed to be elevated to the Supreme Leader\u2019s position.\n\nRaisi\u2019s death will create \u201ca succession crisis in Iran,\u201d Karim Sadjadpour, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, wrote on X.\n\nThe late president upheld some of the regime\u2019s most hardline policies, quashing the 2022 mass protests that sought to challenge repressive laws, such as the compulsory hijab.\n\nAccording to the constitution, the 88-member Assembly of Experts picks the successor to the Supreme Leader after his death. Members of the Assembly itself are, however, pre-vetted by Iran\u2019s Guardian Council, a powerful 12-member body charged with overseeing elections and legislation.\n\nThe Assembly of Experts has become increasingly hardline over the years. In the March vote, Raisi was re-elected to the assembly, and the Guardian Council barred Rouhani from contesting a seat.\n\nWhile there are procedures to selecting the Supreme Leader, discussions about successions are always \u201cvery opaque,\u201d Vakil said, adding that they take place \u201cwithin a very close circle of individuals.\u201d\n\nSome have pointed to the incumbent Supreme Leader\u2019s son Mojtaba Khamenei, a midlevel cleric, as a potential contender for the top post, but that would be a shift from the principles of the Islamic Republic, which overthrew a repressive monarchy in 1970 and has prided itself for shaking off hereditary rule.\n\nAllowing Mojtaba to replace his father may, however, spur theories that Raisi\u2019s death was not accidental, Sadjadpour said.\n\nRaisi\u2019s rivals are also likely to try to fill the vacuum he leaves, Vaez said.\n\n\u201c(This) definitely throws all the plans that offices of the Supreme Leader probably had out the window,\u201d Vaez told CNN\u2019s Paula Newton.\n\nHe added, however, that Iran has no shortage of political actors who are \u201csubservient and belong to the old guard of the Islamic Republic\u201d who can replace Raisi.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback What's next after the death of Iran's president? 03:56 - Source: CNN\n\nHow will it impact Iran\u2019s foreign relations?\n\nRaisi and Amir-Abdollahian oversaw a turnaround in Iran\u2019s relations with its Arab neighbors, helping normalized relations with longtime foe Saudi Arabia, with China\u2019s assistance. But they also saw the Islamic Republic initiate a large-scale direct attack on Israel for the first time, after a suspected Israeli attack on an Iranian diplomatic compound in Syria. That prompted Israel to launch an unprecedented retaliation, bringing the shadow war between the two nations out into the open.\n\nExperts say that Raisi\u2019s death is unlikely to have an impact on the regime\u2019s foreign policy, which is almost exclusively the domain of the Supreme Leader.\n\nIran\u2019s foreign policy is decided by the Supreme National Security Council and can be vetoed by the Supreme Leader, Mohammad Ali Shabani, Iran expert and editor of the Amwaj.media news outlet, told CNN\u2019s Anderson. \u201cWe will see continuity in terms of how Iran approaches the regional files, collaboration with regional allies.\u201d\n\nHe added that a similar trajectory is likely to be seen on the nuclear program.\n\nCould the upcoming presidential election bring change to Iran?\n\nSome experts say that the election presents an opportunity for the regime to bring back sidelined moderates. While Khamenei is likely to maintain conservative rule, he \u201chas always emphasized voter turnout as a litmus test of the legitimacy of the system,\u201d Shabani said. \u201cThat election can be a watershed moment for Iran.\u201d\n\nRaisi came to power in elections that many Iranians saw as a foregone conclusion. With moderate candidates squeezed out, voter turnout was extremely low, highlighting the regime\u2019s waning legitimacy.\n\n\u201cIf the Supreme Leader chooses to use these early elections as a watershed moment to open up the political space, to get people to vote again, that could be a massive gamechanger,\u201d Shabani said, adding that this would also impact succession to the Supreme Leader.\n\nWhat are the funeral plans?\n\nMulti-day funeral ceremonies for Raisi will begin on Tuesday in Tabriz and continue in Qom, Tehran and Mashhad, according to Mohsen Mansouri, the head of the funeral planning committee and and Iran\u2019s vice president of executive affairs.\n\nSpeaking to state television on Monday, Mansouri said funeral prayers will begin in the northwestern city of Tabriz at 9:30 a.m. local time on Tuesday. There will be a procession from the Tabriz Martyr\u2019s Square to the Tabriz Mosallah (prayer hall).\n\nLater on Tuesday, the bodies of the victims of the helicopter crash will be transferred to the holy Shiite city of Qom, where funeral prayers will take place at 4:30 p.m. local time (9 a.m. ET) outside the Fatima Masumeh Shrine. Afterwards, on Tuesday evening, the bodies will be transferred to Tehran\u2019s Grand Mosallah Mosque, according to Mansouri.\n\nOn Wednesday, large ceremonies are planned in Tehran at the Grand Mosallah. One or two other ceremonies will be announced later, according to Mansouri.\n\nOn Thursday morning, funeral prayers will begin in Birjand, South Khorasan province, where Raisi served as the Supreme Leader\u2019s representative. Later on Thursday, Raisi\u2019s body will be transferred to the Imam Reza shrine in Mashhad where Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei will conduct prayers over Raisi\u2019s body, according to Mehr news.\n\nOn Thursday night, Raisi\u2019s body will be buried in Mashhad, according to Mansouri.\n\nMansouri also announced the closure of offices on Wednesday all over the country, and said the governors in the provinces where processions will take place can declare public holidays on Wednesday.",

        "text": "The first Biden-Trump debate will be in Atlanta, a city rich with political drama\nAfter it appeared voters wouldn\u2019t get the chance to see the Democratic and Republican presidential candidates square off this year, President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump last week agreed to two debates.\n\nThe first debate will take place June 27 in Atlanta, Georgia. It\u2019s welcome news for the city of Atlanta, which was one of three finalists bidding to host the 2024 Democratic National Convention. It ultimately lost out to Chicago, but it wasn\u2019t for lack of political drama within the state.\n\nAtlanta became an epicenter of conspiracy theories and \u201celection fraud\u201d alleged by the Trump campaign during the 2020 election. Fulton County is now the site of the former president\u2019s election inference case. And the battleground state carries major electoral weight, having flipped blue for the first time in nearly 30 years during the last presidential election.\n\nThe location of the debate has history for Trump and will likely give him and Biden plenty to spar over.\n\nMore:Biden and Trump to debate in Atlanta, announces CNN\n\nTrump\u2019s history with Fulton County, Georgia\n\nIt\u2019s fitting that the debate will be held at CNN\u2019s studios, nestled in the center of Fulton County. The studios are less than a mile from the State Farm Arena, which served as a ballot processing site during the 2020 election.\n\nState Farm Arena quickly became the subject of conspiracy theories about illicit votes spread by Trump and his associates on social media in the hours following the election. Trump claimed that surveillance video showed election workers staying after hours and removing \u201csuitcases full of ballots\u201d from under a table.\n\nThe truth was much simpler. A plumbing issue at the arena had delayed Election Day operations, forcing some election workers to stay late to continue processing ballots. After a lengthy investigation by multiple agencies, it was determined that no fraud took place.\n\nThe Fulton County courthouse\n\nFormer President Trump is now intimately familiar with the Fulton County Courthouse, just half a mile from the site of the upcoming debate.After an investigation by the Fulton County District Attorney\u2019s Office, Trump became the first former president to be indicted on felony charges in Georgia. He and 18 allies were charged with trying to interfere with the 2020 presidential election in Georgia after pressuring state officials to overturn the results.\n\nProsecutors in Georgia proposed August 5 as a start date for the trial.\n\nGeorgia\u2019s potential as a swing state\n\nThe Georgia State Capitol, located a mile from the debate stage, played a significant role in the 2020 election.\n\nIt was where Biden was certified as the first Democrat to win Georgia in almost three decades, defeating Trump by nearly 12,000 votes.Georgia will remain a crucial swing state for the candidates in the 2024 election. Both Trump and Biden have made multiple stops to the Peach State during their reelection campaigns, showing just how important these votes are to the candidates.",

        "text": "Why Gen Z\u2019s vote matters in 2024\nIn the 2020 presidential election, the youth vote was at a record high. In 2024, with a rematch looming, a repeat doesn\u2019t seem likely.\n\nA poll from the Harvard Kennedy School suggests Gen Z may be less likely to vote in 2024. Only 49% of under-30 voters \u201cdefinitely\u201d planned to cast a ballot, down from the 54% of young Americans under 30 who voted in 2020.\n\nBut elections experts say that Generation Z can play a crucial role in deciding the November vote. Nearly 41 million Gen Zers can help elect a president this year, including 8 million who will be able to vote for the first time, according to data from Tufts\u2019 Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement CIRCLE.\n\n\u201cTheir vote does matter, not just for president, but even for president it matters,\u201d said Margaret Susan Thompson, an associate professor of political science and history at Syracuse University. \u201cAnd even if you live in a state that seems clearly one, red or blue, it may not be. But, not every election is going to be that kind of exciting election. But it\u2019s still important. It does make a difference.\u201d\n\nSince the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, states now make laws about abortion. This issue brought many voters out for the mid-term elections, where voter turnout for Gen Z was higher in their first midterm than in other generations. Abortion is a top issue to Gen Z, according to CIRCLE, a finding that did not surprise Thompson.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re the ones who are more likely to need the kinds of health services that are threatened or that have already been threatened in various parts of the country,\u201d she said. \u201cSo for purely self-interested reasons, I think there are reasons to vote.\u201d\n\nIssues that matter\n\nGen Z is outspoken about issues that matter to them, including social justice and reproductive rights, said Jessica Ronan-Frisch, the program manager at Rutgers University\u2019s Center for Youth Political Participation.\n\n\u201cYoung adults, especially Gen Z, they\u2019ve really seen protesting and contacting their elected officials and advocating with their elected officials as a way to make a change,\u201d she said.\n\nFrequent topics in national elections like Social Security or Medicare may not resonate with younger voters, Ronan-Frisch acknowledged. The people who come out to vote tend to control the issues conversations during campaigns.\n\n\u201cThe more young people that vote, there will be a greater shift in what the priorities are,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd the more young people vote, the more likely they are to see a candidate who thinks like they do when it comes to making policies.\n\n\u201cThis generation specifically is the most diverse, the most educated,\u201d Ronan-Frisch said. \u201cAnd they also have the most experience. Politics vary directly in their lives, and I think the more that they turn out, the more and more diverse that our electorate can look like and they can look like them and speak to their needs and their values as well.\u201d",

        "text": "Trump\u2019s campaign says it will begin accepting contributions through cryptocurrency\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump \u2018s presidential campaign said Tuesday it would begin accepting donations in cryptocurrency as part of an effort to build what it calls a \u201ccrypto army\u201d leading up to Election Day.\n\nThe Trump campaign launched a fundraising page that allows \u201cany federally permissible donor the ability to give\u201d to its political committees using any crypto asset accepted through the Coinbase cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nThe announcement promotes Trump\u2019s message that he is a crypto-friendly candidate, and also appeals to a core group of young male voters who are increasingly likely to dabble in digital assets. It came as Trump\u2019s defense rested in his hush money case in New York.\n\nCryptocurrencies are a digital asset that can be traded over the internet without relying on the global banking system.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign is accepting a range of popular cryptocurrencies that include Bitcoin, Ether and US Dollar Coin, and also include the low-value coins that tend to be popular with Internet personalities like Shiba Inu Coin, and Dogecoin.\n\nREAD MORE: Biden and Democrats raised $51 million in April, far below Trump and the GOP\u2019s $76 million\n\nBillionaire Elon Musk, most notably, is considered a fan of the latter two, traded on markets as DOGE and SHIB.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear whether the Trump campaign will hold onto the crypto or will immediately sell it, and what sort of fees it may pay to liquidate. While the campaign says it plans to follow U.S. election laws, the anonymous nature of cryptocurrencies can make it tricky to confirm the funds are coming from who they say they are.\n\nTrump has already received millions in cryptocurrency personally through his Trump Digital Trading Cards non-fungible token projects and his MAGA coin, which was released last August.\n\nJulia Krieger, a spokeswoman for Coinbase, told The Associated Press that \u201ccrypto is nonpartisan and moves money forward because it\u2019s cheaper and faster,\u201d adding that the Coinbase platform is open to all candidates this election season.\n\nA representative from President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign did not respond to an Associated Press request for comment on whether it will begin accepting cryptocurrency donations.\n\nWhile some states don\u2019t allow cryptocurrency donations in state races under existing campaign finance laws, the Federal Election Commission does allow committees to receive bitcoin as contributions.\n\nA 2014 advisory opinion issued by the commission concluded that bitcoin is \u201cmoney or anything of value\u201d within the meaning of the law and political committees should value the contribution based on the market value of bitcoin at the time the contribution is received.\n\nThe presidential campaign for independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. currently accepts bitcoin donations.\n\nIn conventional money, Biden and the Democratic National Committee said Monday that they raised more than $51 million in April, falling well short of the $76 million that Trump and the Republican Party reported taking in for the month.\n\nAssociated Press reporter Ken Sweet in New York contributed to this report.",

        "text": "What to know about Mohammad Mokhber, who is stepping in as interim president of Iran\nWhat to know about Mohammad Mokhber, who is stepping in as interim president of Iran\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption AP AP\n\nIranian President Ebrahim Raisi, Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian and several other government officials were killed in a helicopter crash on Sunday, leaving the country in leadership limbo at a time of especially high regional tensions.\n\nAfter their deaths were confirmed by state media on Monday, Iran's supreme leader, Ali Khamenei \u2014 who is the highest-ranking political and religious leader in the republic \u2014 announced five days of mourning and a new interim president: Mohammad Mokhber.\n\nThe president is Iran's second-ranking \u2014 but top-elected \u2014 official. Mokhber is expected to hold that role temporarily since Iran's constitution requires that a new election must be held within 50 days of the death of a sitting president.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nRobin Wright, a joint fellow at the U.S. Institute of Peace and the Wilson Center, says Raisi's death may not shake up the day-to-day running of the country, but rather its longer-term future, as the hardliner was widely considered a potential successor to 85-year-old Khamenei.\n\n\"There will be a process that's in place, they will find a new president, but the scramble behind the scenes will be very, very interesting,\" she told Morning Edition.\n\nMokhber, 68, is part of the three-person council charged with organizing that election.\n\nAt a Monday meeting, he urged top Iranian officials to continue their work without disruption, the Washington Post reported.\n\n\"The framework and foundations of the system are strong, and there will not be the slightest problem in the administration of the country under the permanent shadow of the leadership,\" Mokhber said.\n\nHe most recently served as first vice president of Iran, the most senior of a dozen such positions. He's kept a relatively low profile despite holding a series of prominent roles in Iran's government and charitable foundations, including those with ties to Khamenei, and has been sanctioned by both the U.S. and European Union.\n\nHere's what else to know about him.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nHis tenure as top deputy included a wartime visit to Moscow\n\nMokhber, who holds a Ph.D. in international law, was appointed first vice president when Raisi was elected in 2021.\n\nAccording to the revised Iranian constitution of 1989, the president's first deputy can be tasked with \"the responsibilities of administering the affairs of the Council of Ministers and coordination of functions of other deputies,\" with the president's approval.\n\nThe first vice president will also assume \u2014 with the approval of the supreme leader \u2014 the \"powers and functions\" of the president in the case of their death, dismissal or absence.\n\n\"The Council, consisting of the Speaker of the Islamic Consultative Assembly, head of the judicial power, and the first deputy of the President, is obliged to arrange for a new President to be elected within a maximum period of fifty days,\" reads Article 131.\n\nIn his role as first vice president, Mokhber traveled within Iran to shore up political support, including visiting the site of a 2022 building collapse that killed dozens and fueled accusations of corruption against those involved in the permitting process. He also had a hand in international diplomacy, receiving visiting leaders from places like Syria and China.\n\nVice presidents tend to hold a relatively low profile in Iran, though Mokhber did generate some headlines during his tenure.\n\nHe was part of a team of Iranian security officials who visited Moscow in October 2022, months into Russia's war with Ukraine, to discuss weapons deliveries. Reuters reported that the group agreed to provide more surface-to-surface missiles and drones to Russia's military.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that during that visit, Mokhber blamed NATO for the killing of Ukrainians and proposed an Iranian-Russian working group to undermine Western sanctions.\n\n\"We have been under these sanctions for 40 years and did not allow them to undermine the government of the country or to seriously affect us,\" he said of Iran, suggesting they had much to teach Moscow.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Dmitry Astakhov/AP Dmitry Astakhov/AP\n\nMokhber was a key player in a network of charities with ties to the state\n\nMokhber's official biography touts his \"experience in numerous management positions,\" including with several foundations and the production of Iran's first COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nMokhber has played a key role in several charitable trusts tied to the Iranian state, known as bonyads.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Department has described them as \"opaque, quasi-official organizations generally controlled by current and former government officials and clerics that report directly to the Supreme Leader.\" It says a lack of accountability has \"allowed systemic corruption and mismanagement to grow unchecked,\" accumulating wealth without benefiting the Iranian people as promised.\n\nUnited Against Nuclear Iran, a U.S.-based nonprofit advocacy organization, says Mokhber spent a large part of his career working at \"important Bonyads implicated in Iran's ballistic missile and nuclear programs, terrorism, corruption, mismanagement, human rights violations, and sanctions evasion.\"\n\nMokhber was most recently the head of Setad, an investment fund linked to Khamenei. Its full name is Setad Ejraiye Farmane Hazrate Emam, also known as the Execution of Imam Khomeini's Order (EIKO). It was established by Khamenei's predecessor and derives many of its assets from property seized from Iranian citizens, according to Reuters.\n\nMokhber joined Setad as its chief executive in 2007. The U.S. imposed sanctions on the organization in 2013, calling it a \"massive network of front companies hiding assets on behalf of the Government of Iran's leadership.\"\n\nYears later, during the height of the pandemic, Mokhber oversaw Setad's effort to make a COVID-19 vaccine, through one of its foundations. The Associated Press says \"only a fraction\" of its promised tens of millions of doses \"ever made it to the public, without explanation.\"\n\nThe U.S. sanctioned Setad \u2014 which it calls EIKO \u2014 again, along with Mokhber personally, in 2021.\n\n\"EIKO has systematically violated the rights of dissidents by confiscating land and property from opponents of the regime, including political opponents, religious minorities, and exiled Iranians, while, according to its leader Mohammad Mokhber, being tasked by the Supreme Leader to implement a resistance economy,\" the Treasury Department said at the time, describing an economy that tries to circumvent sanctions.\n\nMokhber was also among a group of seven Iranians that the European Union sanctioned in 2010 for involvement in \"nuclear or ballistic missiles activities.\" He was removed from the list two years later.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nMokhber has also held senior roles in Sina Bank and the Mostazafan Foundation, both of which have been subject to U.S. sanctions.\n\nThe Treasury Department has said Khameini uses the Mostazafan Foundation \u2014 a conglomerate of holdings in key sectors including finance, energy and mining \u2014 to \"reward his allies under the pretense of charity.\"\n\nDuring Mokhber's tenure at Mostazafan, he ended up embroiled in a legal battle between two mobile phone service providers \u2014 Turkcell and MTN \u2014 looking to enter the Iranian market, the AP reports. Turkcell ultimately alleged in legal filings that Mokhber used \"improper influence up to and including negotiating with and on behalf of the Supreme Leader in MTN's favor.\"\n\nMokhber also joined Iran's Expediency Council in 2022. The group advises the supreme leader and settles disputes over legislation between Iran's parliament and the Guardian Council, which consists of six experts in Islamic law and six experts in constitutional law.\n\n\"If his past is any indication of his future, his current role in the elected branch of government will be used to perpetuate corruption, implement a resistance economy, and punish regime enemies,\" says United Against Nuclear Iran.",

        "text": "Mexicans living in the U.S. vote early in their homeland's historic presidential election\nDALLAS \u2014 Both of Mexico\u2019s front-running presidential candidates are women \u2014 and voters like Diana Garcia of Dallas say they are excited and \u201cproud\u201d to elect the country\u2019s first female president.\n\nGarcia is among the more than 675,000 Mexicans living abroad \u2014 the majority of them in the U.S. \u2014 who are registered to vote and have the voter identification needed to participate in the election, according to the National Electoral Institute.\n\nWith early voting already underway ahead of Election Day on June 2, Mexicans living in the U.S. are getting ready to participate in Mexico\u2019s national election, one of the most consequential in the country's recent history.\n\nWhile their numbers may seem low compared to the nearly 98 million people registered to vote in Mexico, \u201cthat doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re less important,\u201d Ibero-American University professor and Mexican political scientist Mario Campos said, adding that there has been an increased interest in engaging these voters, \u201cwhich is a positive sign.\u201d\n\nMany Mexicans in the U.S. have already voted by mail, online and in-person at selected consulates \u2014 effectively participating in Mexico's \"largest election in its history,\" according to Lila Abed, acting director of the Mexican Institute at the Wilson Center, a nonpartisan research organization.\n\nVoters are also electing all 628 seats in both chambers of Congress and tens of thousands of local positions, according to the National Electoral Institute.\n\nCampos said the voting by U.S.-based Mexicans seems to respond to a broader effort centered on leveraging the cultural connections between Mexicans residing abroad and their homeland to strengthen economic and political ties between Mexico and the U.S., where 97% of those who have left Mexico live.\n\n\u201cWe have fought for over 20 years to see the voice of Mexicans in the United States counted and for the vote to be made more accessible,\" said Francisco Moreno, co-founder and executive director of the Council of Mexican Federations, a coalition of 14 groups representing the interests of Mexicans living in the U.S.\n\nThe stakes of electing the first female president\n\nIn this election, voters will mainly decide if Mexico\u2019s path forward is strengthening its traditional government structures or reforming them entirely, according to Campos.\n\n\u201cThese are very different views,\u201d Campos said. \u201cThe election results will have consequences that are going to lead the country in very different directions.\u201d\n\nClaudia Sheinbaum, the presidential candidate from Mexico's governing political party, Morena \u2014 founded by her mentor and the outgoing president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador \u2014 has centered her campaign on \"convincing voters that the country is heading in the right direction\" and that a vote for her will ensure continuity on social programs said to have helped lift millions out of poverty and reduce violent crimes, according to Campos.\n\nSheinbaum, the former mayor of Mexico City, is a physicist and climate scientist and is of Jewish heritage.\n\nL\u00f3pez Obrador significantly increased public spending during his term to pay for programs that provide cash payments to older citizens and young people attending school, as well as for food assistance to the neediest. Significant reforms to Mexico\u2019s pension system are also expected to go into effect right before Election Day next month.\n\nFor Clara Mej\u00eda Orta, 30, pensions are among the top issues motivating her to vote by mail from Los Angeles, the American city with the highest number of Mexican nationals with valid voter identifications.\n\n\"A lot of my family members have worked their entire life and are about to retire, but they can't,\" she said. \"There's no money to pay their pensions.\"\n\nWhile Sheinbaum's platform may appear to echo Mejia Orta's concerns over prioritizing pensions, Mej\u00eda Orta said she feels conflicted about the candidate's potential handling of economic and immigration issues that also matter to her. Before mailing her ballot in, Mej\u00eda Orta plans on getting additional insight from her family in Mexico to make her final choice.\n\nSheinbaum has said that Mexicans who live abroad are crucial to translating foreign policy into \"internal well-being\" for Mexico, according to Gabriela Cuevas, a former senator and Morena member.\n\nRemittances sent by Mexicans living abroad are considered one of Mexico\u2019s main sources of income, L\u00f3pez Obrador has said. A recent BBVA report found remittances to Mexico grew 7.6% in 2023, reaching $63.3 billion. Almost all (96%) came from the U.S.\n\n\"The community of Mexicans in the United States not only sends a lot of remittances,\" Cuevas said in Spanish. \"We must support them, protect them and leverage their skills so that they can contribute to the economy, to academia, to sciences.\"\n\nJennifer Chavez Ramirez, first row-left, stands with other DACA recipients in Mexico City in 2022. She plans to vote for Sheinbaum. Courtesy Jennifer Chavez Ramirez\n\nJennifer Chavez Ramirez of Los Angeles said she plans to vote for Sheinbaum and will be casting her ballot online, an option that is widely available to any Mexican living abroad who has registered. In previous elections, the online option was offered only in selected Mexican states.\n\nChavez Ramirez, 28, is a recipient of DACA, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and said she has good memories of Sheinbaum from when she visited Mexico City in 2022 through \u201cadvance parole,\u201d a program that allowed her to travel to Mexico and ensured that she would be allowed to return to the U.S.\n\nChavez Ramirez said Sheinbaum welcomed her and other Mexican undocumented young immigrants who've been in the U.S. since they were children and are able to work and study under the DACA program.\n\n\"She acknowledged the challenges we face in the United States, and offered encouragement and support,\" Chavez Ramirez said. \"It is important for our experiences and voices to be taken into consideration on both sides of the border.\"\n\nL\u00f3pez Obrador's Morena party dominated in the 2018 election after positioning itself as an alternative against the traditional political parties that had long governed Mexico such as the conservative National Action Party, or PAN, the small progressive Democratic Revolution Party, and the old-guard Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI. This is a big reason why Morena's \"vision of government\" centers around reforming Mexico's judicial system and local governments, according to Campos.\n\nBut presidential candidate X\u00f3chitl G\u00e1lvez of the opposition coalition Broad Front for Mexico \u2014 which is made up of more traditional political parties \u2014 has been working to convince voters that continuing the Morena regime \"puts the country at risk,\" Campos said.\n\nG\u00e1lvez's party argues that health care access and economic development have stalled under Morena and crime rates remain high.\n\nJorge \u00c1lvarez M\u00e1ynez, the Citizen Movement party's presidential candidate, is running a distant third in the polls.\n\nA first for in-person voting\n\nThis is the first election in which Mexican nationals abroad were able to vote in-person in selected Mexican consulates in the U.S., Canada and Europe.\n\nOn Monday, Garcia and about 100 other voters cast their ballots for G\u00e1lvez at the Mexican Consulate in Dallas, the U.S. city with the second-highest number of Mexican nationals with valid voter identifications.\n\nIn Dallas, Mexican citizens hold marea rosa, or pink wave signs, in support of presidential candidate X\u00f3chitl G\u00e1lvez. Courtesy Diana Garcia\n\nThey all dressed in pink and carried signs that read \"marea rosa,\" Spanish for \"pink wave,\" in support of the movement led by the Broad Front for Mexico coalition.\n\nSupporters of the \"marea rosa\" believe L\u00f3pez Obrador is destroying democracy in Mexico, Garcia said, accusing the president of dismantling government institutions and militarizing the country.\n\nTo Garcia, Sheinbaum \u201cis a puppet\u201dof L\u00f3pez Obrador and a vote for her is also a vote for him, she said.\n\nA sampling of materials and instructions for Mexicans who are voting from abroad. Courtesy Clara Mej\u00eda Orta\n\nJuan Hernandez, a former secretary of migrant and foreign affairs in Guanajuato, Mexico, is a vocal supporter of G\u00e1lvez. Hernandez, who is half Mexican and half American, said he plans to vote online.\n\nHe believes G\u00e1lvez, a senator and tech entrepreneur of Indigenous heritage, represents the change \u201cMexicans are desperate for,\u201d Hernandez said in Spanish. \u201cThat\u2019s why migrants leave the country, because they lack the opportunities they deserve in Mexico. They leave for the U.S. to seek better jobs, to escape crime and find security.\u201d\n\nAs a Mexican national in the U.S., Jorge Leal has consistently voted in Mexico's elections by mail.\n\n\u201cA big part of why I vote, knowing my vote as a binational citizen is not as impactful yet, is to honor the work of groups that emerged in the 1980s and \u201990s and were created by Mexican immigrants in areas like South East Los Angeles to amplify the community\u2019s voice,\" Leal, a history professor at the University of California, Riverside said.\n\nNicole Acevedo reported from New York, Cora Cervantes from Los Angeles, and Kayla McCormick from Dallas.",

        "text": "Til November, he's the world's most interesting man\nAndy Crosby is the guy you want at your dinner party in the next few months. With about six months until \"Decision 2024,\" he's elbows deep in presidential polls, scouring their methodology, debunking them when necessary.\n\nCrosby, who is an assistant professor in the School of Public Policy, became immersed with surveys and polls about 10 years ago. He teaches survey research at UCR, and he designs, consumes, or analyzes polls and surveys every week, even when it isn't a presidential election year.\n\n\"Although we rely on polling and survey research to inform us on a wide variety of public policy matters, relatively less energy has been dedicated to understanding how to better create and consume surveys,\" said Crosby, who joined UCR's faculty in fall 2023. \"My goal is to work with students and the broader community to help people be more prepared to both design and consume surveys.\"\n\nWith the presidential primaries and elections approaching, the numbers of polls is increasing - which means Crosby is spending a lot more time comparing polls. Many leading polls have Donald Trump edging out Joe Biden. But are those polls any good? And is it too early to pay any attention to polls? It's a good time to check in with UCR's resident polling expert.\n\nStories in the past couple days have asserted Trump is leading Biden in five of six key states. How do you access the methodology behind these polls?\n\nSiena College/New York Times is a trusted pollster and I trust the results of these polls. Their sampling methodology allows for more precise results (for example, the polls are stratified by party to make sure that the poll reaches voters from each party) and they are transparent with both their findings and methods. As a consumer of this poll, it should be reassuring to see the extensive disclosure of both their findings and methods.\n\nWhat did the polls tell us about a Biden-Trump election in May 2020?\n\nMost major polls had Biden leading Trump, although the margin varied somewhat by poll and by date. For example, a Washington Post-ABC News poll conducted May 25-28, 2020 showed Biden leading Trump, 53-43 percent.\n\nIn the May 19 USA Today, columnist Rex Huppke asserts: \u201cAnyone using polling data to assert anything with even a modicum of certainty is a fool.\u201d He is referring to the fact presidential elections are six months out. Is he right?\n\nTo some degree. Polls represent a snapshot in time. I generally view polls today as accurate for what they are trying to measure \u2013 that is, what voters think today. I would not yet use current polls to predict the outcome in November. Voters do sometimes change their minds between May and November. Part of the reason they may change their mind is due to events that occur during that time \u2013 for example, we will likely have at least two presidential debates that may help to inform voters on which candidate more closely represents their views. As such, polls closer to the election are likely to be more accurate.\n\nIn what proximity to presidential elections is it worth tuning in to polls?\n\nEven though current polls will not necessarily predict the outcome of the November election, I view current polls as valuable. These polls tell us what voters think now \u2013 for example, what they feel the biggest issues are facing the country. That said, if I wanted to predict the election, the polls as we get closer to the election will likely be the most accurate. Recent research demonstrates this increase in accuracy over time and argues that the optimal lead time is approximately two to three months prior to the election, depending on how much error one is willing to accept. I also expect to see a large increase in the number of polls in the last 100 days prior to the election based on previous data.\n\nIs there data that speaks to the historical accuracy of polls six months before a presidential election?\n\nPolls six months prior to the election tend to have larger errors, with six months out still including a considerable amount of error. As I mentioned above, recent research suggests that two to three months out is an optimal lead time.\n\nWhat do the polls tell us about the effect Robert F. Kennedy Jr. may have on the election returns?\n\nThe polls tell us that Kennedy certainly has support among the electorate, but I would use caution translating that into election returns at this point. Part of the reason for this is that Kennedy is not yet on the ballot in all 50 states, although he has an active effort to achieve ballot access in more states. Once we have a fuller picture of Kennedy\u2019s ballot access, we can start to better gauge the potential effect of Kennedy\u2019s candidacy on elections.\n\nWhat are your favorite polls, and why?\n\nI personally admire the work of NORC at the University of Chicago. More generally, polls that use probability sampling (that is, random selection) are generally considered among the highest-quality polls. These polls are generally considered more accurate than nonprobability samples (for example, approaching someone in a mall and asking them questions), which have become more popular in recent years. Transparency about polling methods (for example, knowing who sponsored the research) is also extremely important. The American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) Transparency Initiative is the gold standard for this type of disclosure, and I would trust polls that are a member of the AAPOR TI more than polls that are not.\n\nAre there widely quoted polls for which you question the methodology?\n\nSometimes the answer to this question depends more on the method than the outlet. Even national media outlets (such as the Washington Post) sometimes report the results of polls that use different methods for different stories. I generally use extra caution with polls that do not use probability sampling and/or polls that disclose their methods. The difference in accuracy between randomly sampling registered voters and walking up to people in the mall can be stark. Similarly, if you as a consumer of a poll or survey cannot find basic information about how the poll was conducted (e.g., who was sampled, who funded the poll), I would be reluctant to trust the results of that poll.\n\nIs it more difficult to poll voters accurately today than it once was? Easier?\n\nIn general, high-quality polls are quite accurate today, and have been for quite some time. The difference between today and past years is that response rates are going down \u2013 for example, telephone response rates today are typically less than 10%. Although lower response rates do not necessarily mean lower quality results, more effort and resources may be needed to reach the same quality estimate.",

        "text": "6 key facts about abortion laws and the 2024 election\n6 key facts about abortion laws and the 2024 election\n\nLoading...\n\nIn the nearly two years since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, abortion access has been in an almost constant state of flux.\n\nState laws keep changing \u2013 with new bans taking effect in some places while new protections are enacted in others. And there have been a slew of lawsuits and ballot measures that may motivate voters come November.\n\nHere are 6 facts about where things currently are with abortion and the election.\n\n1. About half of states restrict abortion.\n\nIn 14 states, there are total bans on abortion, with very limited exceptions in cases such as rape or to save the life or health of the mother. A few more states \u2013 including Florida \u2013 have six-week bans, and often that's so early in a pregnancy most people don't yet know they're pregnant. Another half dozen states have restrictions that limit abortion after 12, 15, 18 or 22 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nIn the states that ban or severely restrict abortion access, the number of abortions has dropped drastically.\n\nBut legal challenges and ballot initiatives mean the map could keep shifting. So far, voters will be weighing in on the right to an abortion in four states: Colorado, Florida, Maryland and South Dakota. Six more states are in the process of getting it on the ballot, including Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, Arizona, Arkansas and Montana.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n2. Bans are affecting where doctors work.\n\nIdaho illustrates how abortion bans can affect a state's broader health care system. Doctors are leaving the state, and three maternity wards have closed since the abortion ban took effect there.\n\n\"We lost 58 obstetricians either to moving out of state or retiring, and in that same time period, only two OB-GYNs moved into Idaho,\" says Dr. Sara Thomson, an OB-GYN in Boise. \"That is not really a sustainable loss-to-gain ratio.\"\n\nIt's not just Idaho \u2013 a lot of hospital systems in states with abortion bans are having recruiting problems. The Association of American Medical Colleges earlier this month reported a decrease in medical students applying to residencies in states that limit abortion access. Essentially, these early career doctors are saying they don't want to practice medicine with the threat of fines, jail time, and the loss of their medical license.\n\n3. Abortions are actually increasing nationally.\n\nSince the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the number of abortions in the U.S. has continued to grow.\n\n\"We are seeing a slow and small, steady increase in the number of abortions per month and this was completely surprising to us,\" says Ushma Upadhyay, who co-leads the Society of Family Planning's WeCount project. According to their recent report, in 2023 there were, on average, 86,000 abortions per month compared to 2022, when there were about 82,000 abortions per month. \"Not huge,\" says Upadhyay, \"but we were expecting a decline.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nA major factor in the uptick in abortions nationwide is the rise of telehealth, made possible in part by regulations first loosened during the coronavirus pandemic. Telehealth abortions now make up nearly 1 in 5 of all abortions in the U.S. Patients don't need to take off work and go to a clinic, they can connect with providers over text messages, phone calls or video, no matter where they live. Abortion medication is then mailed to them at home.\n\nJohn Seago, president of Texas Right To Life, is concerned with the rise of abortions and increased access through telehealth.\n\n\"I'm afraid that we are going to wake up in 20 years and just kind of realize that we won in Dobbs, and then we've been losing ever since,\" Seago says. He told NPR his group is currently working on how to bring criminal and civil challenges to tamp down on the number of abortions.\n\n4. Some states have moved to make abortion access easier.\n\nAbortion was heavily regulated even while Roe v. Wade was the law of the land, and states like Michigan, Colorado, California, Minnesota and others have made moves to undo some of those regulations.\n\nThey are passing laws to get rid of waiting periods and gestational limits, and they are allowing more types of providers like nurse practitioners, for instance, to perform abortions. Some states have stockpiled mifepristone, one of the medicines that can be used for abortion, in case access is curtailed federally in the future.\n\nNew York City made an abortion hub as part of its health department, including a hotline and chat for people to find out where to get an abortion and how to get funding to cover the costs.\n\n5. \"Shield laws\" create new access in untested legal terrain.\n\nAnother way some states have expanded abortion access is by passing \"shield laws.\" These are laws that say doctors and nurses in states where abortion is legal can't be prosecuted by another state if they provide abortion across state lines. They apply if a woman travels to another state for an abortion or if the abortion provider mails pills to someone in a state with restrictions.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nLauren, who is 33 and lives in Utah, got a telehealth abortion from a provider in a state with shield laws. Lauren got pregnant on birth control and decided quickly that she couldn't afford another child. (NPR is not using her last name because she's worried about professional repercussions.)\n\nAbortion is technically legal in Utah until 18 weeks, but Lauren chose an online company called Aid Access, that provides telehealth abortion for people in all 50 states.\n\n\"In my situation, I felt more at ease than I would in a physician's office and more comfortable, to be honest,\" she explains. \"Especially with a provider within the state of Utah \u2013 I feel like there's always a judgmental indication or undertone.\"\n\nShe filled out a form online with questions about how far along she was and her medical history, connected with a doctor via email and text messages, and received abortion medication in the mail. She had her abortion at home.\n\nSome anti-abortion rights groups are hoping to test the legality of shield laws by bringing charges against a doctor, but that hasn't happened yet.\n\n6. The Supreme Court could shake things up again.\n\nThere are two major decisions on abortion pending right now before the Supreme Court.\n\nOne is about the abortion pill mifepristone. The Court could restrict this drug for the whole country and totally change access to medication abortion through telemedicine. Court watchers think it won't go that way, but no one knows for sure.\n\nThe other case is about abortion in emergency situations and it centers on Idaho's medical exception. It's a fight over whether federal or state law should have priority. The oral arguments left legal analysts unsure about which way the Court was leaning.\n\nBoth of these decisions are expected in late June or early July, just a few months before the election. Regardless of what the justices decide, it's going to catapult abortion back into the headlines a few months before the election.\n\n",

        "text": "Vanderbilt Poll: Majority of Tennessee voters now pro-choice, gender gap developing on key issues\nThings to know:\n\nThe majority of Tennessee registered voters consider themselves definitely or somewhat pro-choice , including 93 percent of Democrats , 54 percent of Independents and 30 percent of non-MAGA Republicans\n\nDiffering attitudes between men and women on key state issues could prove influential on public policy in Tennessee and appears to be part of potentially significant national trend\n\nIVF and proposed gun control legislation have bipartisan approval\n\nSixty percent of Tennessee voters favor legalizing marijuana for recreational use\n\nThe semiannual, statewide Vanderbilt Poll showed in its most recent survey that slightly more than half of the state\u2019s voters support a woman\u2019s right to an abortion, that there is significant bipartisan support of IVF procedures as well as modest gun control legislation, and that views about many state and national issues differ significantly by gender.\n\n\u201cThis latest Vanderbilt Poll suggests that there continues to be misalignment between the actions of the state legislature and a majority of registered voters on a number of key policies,\u201d said John Geer, co-director of the Vanderbilt Poll, senior advisor to Chancellor Daniel Diermeier, professor of political science and holder of a Gertrude Conaway Vanderbilt Chair. \u201cAnd we also see evidence of a substantial difference by gender in attitudes on important issues that could be part of a larger, more influential national trend.\u201d\n\nThe Vanderbilt University survey of 1,003 Tennessee registered voters was conducted in English from April 26 to May 9, 2024.\n\nDecade-long trend toward pro-choice continues\n\nThe poll revealed that current state abortion laws, which are some of the strictest in the country, are not in line with an overall majority of voters. Tennessee is one of 14 states that have banned nearly all abortions. The state legislature adopted an explicit medical exemption to the law in August 2023.\n\nThe Vanderbilt Poll revealed that 52 percent of registered voters consider themselves \u201cdefinitely\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d pro-choice, supporting a woman\u2019s right to choose. These results are part of a statewide shift toward a pro-choice majority. In the May 2014 poll, 45 percent of Tennesseans considered themselves \u201cdefinitely\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d pro-choice, and in the May 2022 poll, 48 percent of Tennesseans thought of themselves as definitely or somewhat pro-choice.\n\n\u201cThere is clear evidence that Tennessee is a \u2018pro-exception\u2019 state, with voters accepting of the right to choice in cases such as rape, incest, the health of a mother or fetal viability, but now the state has also moved into pro-choice camp,\u201d Geer said.\n\n\u201cRepublicans remain very much pro-life,\u201d Geer added, \u201cbut we do see a slight shift across the state to a pro-choice stance, which likely is a reaction to the Dobbs decision in 2022. Many Tennesseans considered themselves pro-life until the Dobbs case overturned Roe v. Wade.\u201d\n\nThe differences across parties are clear. Among Democrats, 93 percent are pro-choice. Independents stand at 54 percent. Fifty-seven percent of all women, across political identities, identify as pro-choice. In contrast, a large majority of non-MAGA Republicans (69 percent) and MAGA Republicans (78 percent) view themselves as pro-life.\n\n\u201cSince the fall 2022 poll, we have asked respondents who label themselves as Republican if they identify more with the Republican Party or the MAGA movement,\u201d said Vanderbilt Poll Co-Director Josh Clinton, who holds the Abby and Jon Winkelried Chair at Vanderbilt and is a professor of political science. \u201cThat divide between MAGA and non-MAGA Republicans often illuminates significant differences, even within largely conservative labels such as \u2018pro-life.\u2019\u201d\n\nAnother reproductive issue\u2014in vitro fertilization\u2014reflected strong bipartisan agreement. The long-used technique to help those struggling with infertility has garnered more attention since the Alabama Supreme Court ruled embryos created through IVF should be treated as children.\n\nEighty-two percent of Tennessee registered voters said that IVF should be legal. There were strong majorities regardless of political affiliation, leading with Democrats (94 percent), followed by Independents (85 percent), then non-MAGA Republicans (80 percent) and MAGA Republicans (69 percent).\n\n\u201cThis widespread support should give the state legislature and the governor a reason to be more active on the IVF issue,\u201d Geer said. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that voters, regardless of party affiliation, want this option to remain legal.\u201d\n\nThe overarching support for the legality of IVF may be buoyed by the lack of strong views about whether the technique has moral implications. More than half of all respondents (58 percent) believe IVF is not a moral issue, with 29 percent believing it is morally acceptable and 10 percent saying they think it is morally wrong. Along those lines, a clear majority (58 percent) of respondents report thinking IVF is acceptable to allow same-sex parents to have a child, and 65 percent of respondents say unused embryos should not be considered children.\n\nGender divide on many issues\n\nIn addition to the gender gap that exists around positions on abortion, the Vanderbilt Poll revealed several other notable variations between men and women on high profile issues such as gun laws, vaccines, Medicaid expansion, state official approval and the presidential election. These gaps could be politically impactful, locally and nationally.\n\n\u201cThis poll shows a nearly 20-point gap between the views of men and women on many major policy issues, particularly on public health, that we have not seen before,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cThe differences we see among registered voters on issues related to reproductive issues, gun restrictions, the expansion of Medicaid and willingness to get a vaccine for serious illnesses suggests that differences in opinion by gender may have important implications for both voting and policy decisions, in our state and across the country.\u201d\n\nLooking toward the general election, former President Donald Trump is the choice of 47 percent of Tennessee voters, with current President Joe Biden at 29 percent. Men choose Trump at a rate 11 points higher than women, while women choose Biden at a rate 12 points higher than men.\n\n\u201cWhile there is no reason to doubt that Trump will win the solid Republican state of Tennessee regardless of what happens in the current trials based on the latest Vanderbilt Poll,\u201d Clinton said, \u201cwhat seems more important is how the gender differences we are finding in Tennessee may impact the presidential race in swing states such as Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania\u2014where large differences in policy views between men and women could be more decisive.\u201d\n\nAlthough Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R.-Tenn, polls clearly ahead of her challenger, State Rep. Gloria Johnson, D.-Knoxville, for the upcoming U.S. Senate election (51 percent to 40 percent, respectively), the Vanderbilt Poll shows a significant difference between men and women voters. While men heavily favor the incumbent senator, women prefer Johnson over Blackburn 49 percent to 43 percent.\n\nA poll question about Medicaid expansion also uncovered some stark differences between men\u2019s and women\u2019s attitudes. The majority of state voters (62 percent) are in favor of Medicaid expansion, with women (70 percent) significantly stronger in their support than men (54 percent).\n\nGun issues see both agreement and polarization\n\nThere is consistent bipartisan agreement on some specific gun legislation and gun reform issues across the state, but attitudes toward arming teachers at school are sharply split across party lines.\n\n\u201cThere continues to be bipartisan support for modest gun control in the state beyond the policies that the state legislature has decided to enact,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cWhile allowing teachers to carry weapons is an area where opinion is very much divided, there are other policies we asked about receiving strong bipartisan support that were left on the table\u2014including restricting access to individuals with a significant risk of harming themselves or others.\u201d\n\nMore than three-quarters (76 percent) of Tennesseans are in favor of passing laws that temporarily restrict access to guns for individuals who are at high risk of harming themselves or others, in order to reduce the risk of gun-related violence. Democrats (90 percent) are overwhelmingly in favor of these types of laws, with a majority of non-MAGA Republicans (75 percent), Independents (73 percent) and MAGA Republicans (64 percent) in agreement. Across all political affiliations, 81 percent of women strongly agree with these measures, compared with 70 percent of men.\n\nViews on allowing public school teachers and school staff in Tennessee to carry concealed handguns on school grounds are, overall, split evenly (47 percent support, 47 percent oppose). MAGA Republicans (77 percent) and non-MAGA Republicans (71 percent) skew heavily in support of the option of armed teachers, while only 11 percent of Democrats and 47 percent of Independents are in favor.\n\nCurrent Tennessee law allows individuals to carry a handgun, openly or concealed, without a permit. Seventy-one percent of voters do not favor extending state law to allow people to similarly carry long guns\u2014such as hunting rifles. However, the poll reveals a wide gap in support by political identification, with 48 percent of MAGA Republicans in support but only 2 percent of Democrats in support. A 20-point gap exists between the support shown by women (17 percent) and men (37 percent).\n\nPerceptions of illness drive vaccine adoption\n\nVanderbilt Poll results indicate Tennesseans are much less willing to receive \u201cmedically recommended\u201d vaccines than they are to receive vaccines either for \u201cserious illnesses\u201d\u2014such as pneumonia, meningitis and shingles\u2014or diseases uncommon in the United States, such as malaria.\n\nSeventy-six percent of respondents say they are extremely, very or somewhat likely to take a vaccine to prevent a serious illness. Democrats are most likely to get vaccinated in these cases (92 percent), but there also are majorities within Independents (74 percent), non-MAGA Republicans (70 percent) and MAGA Republicans (54 percent) at least somewhat willing to be vaccinated against serious illness. The survey uncovers a 19-point division among men (42 percent) and women (61 percent) who are extremely or very likely to take vaccines for serious illness.\n\nWhen respondents were asked about their willingness to get all \u201cmedically necessary\u201d vaccinations, willingness to get vaccinated drops by 12 points to 64 percent. Democrats remain very open to all vaccines, with 92 percent reporting they would get medically recommended vaccinations. In contrast, nearly 70 percent of Republicans indicate they are not likely or completely unwilling to get these vaccines.\n\nDemocracy under attack\n\nThe Vanderbilt Poll results show that nearly two-thirds (63 percent) of Tennesseans agree that the United States democracy is under attack. There is less agreement about the source of that threat.\n\nRepublicans perceive the Democratic Party as most responsible for an assault on our democracy. Republicans also view China as a serious threat.\n\nFor Democrats, the Republican Party stands out as the biggest perceived threat to democracy. But rather than China, Democrats viewed Russia as a bigger threat.\n\nOther notable findings\n\nOverall, Tennessee registered voters, regardless of whether they have school-age children, are very evenly split on school vouchers that would use state funds to help pay tuition at private or religious schools. When asked if they approve of the concept, 45 percent of respondents are in favor of vouchers, 46 percent oppose them and 9 percent say they neither support nor oppose them. If school vouchers became available, 49 percent of voters are very or somewhat likely to use them, and 50 percent say they would not. MAGA Republicans (71 percent) are, by a wide margin, the group most likely to use the voucher, while only 26 percent of Democrats would take advantage of the option.\n\n\u201cThese results show that vouchers remain a controversial issue,\u201d Geer said. \u201cIt is a complex and complicated topic,\u201d he added, \u201cthat makes the issue difficult to measure in a poll.\u201d\n\nMore than one-third of Tennessee voters (34 percent), including almost half of MAGA Republicans (47 percent), report that they believe the federal government releases chemicals and related substances into the atmosphere to control the weather, evidenced by \u201cchemtrails\u201d in the sky.\n\nThe Vanderbilt Poll indicates that 43 percent of state voters think it is at least somewhat likely that FBI operatives organized and intentionally encouraged the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Nearly a quarter of MAGA Republicans (23 percent) believe it is extremely likely that the FBI was an agitator in these events, while more than half of Democrats (54 percent) think it is not at all likely there was FBI involvement.\n\n\u201cThese results speak to the current political situation where Democrats and Republicans are seeing the world in very different ways,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cWhen partisans differ so dramatically about basic facts about the world, this makes it harder for voters to come together on policy. There are opportunities to exploit certain information sources for political gain, but hopefully politicians and public officials choose to be responsible and point people toward accurate, reliable information so that we can have debates about policy and not about what facts are true.\u201d\n\nGov. Bill Lee\u2019s overall approval rating by state voters stands at 54 percent, with MAGA Republicans (83 percent) and non-MAGA Republicans (81 percent) registering the most support and Democrats offering the least at 18 percent. The governor\u2019s overall approval percentage has dipped noticeably since a high of 65 percent approval in May 2021. Democrats\u2019 approval of Lee is 16 percent.\n\nLess than half (46 percent) of voters approve of the job that the Tennessee legislature is doing. This contrasts noticeably with May 2020 Vanderbilt Poll results, which showed a 60 percent approval rating.\n\n\u201cBecause of recent actions by the Tennessee legislature, overall approval of the assembly and the governor remain low, by historical standards,\u201d Geer said. \u201cState government appears to be paying a bit of a penalty for pursuing policies that are out of touch with Tennesseans.\u201d",

        "text": "Cuba\u2019s Role in U.S. Presidential Elections\nExecutive Summary Few countries have figured as prominently in U.S. elections over the years as Cuba. From the first presidential campaign after the Cuban Revolution in 1959 to the 2020 contest, candidates have brought up Cuba to criticize their opponent for being soft on communism and weak on foreign policy, or to appeal to Cuban American voters in the battleground state of Florida. Indeed, in half the presidential elections since 1960, incumbent presidents have allowed perceived electoral pressure to bend their Cuba policy, by either tightening sanctions or retreating from dialogue. This perceived electoral pressure has severely distorted U.S. foreign policy toward Cuba. Since 1959, that policy has angered our allies, pushed Cuba closer to America\u2019s geopolitical competitors, worsened Cuban human rights, and enabled the Cuban regime to rally nationalist support. This is despite the fact that Cuban Americans have decided only a single election since 1960. Indeed, as this paper demonstrates, the electoral influence of Cuban Americans has been much more limited than generally supposed. The United States\u2019 brief opening to Cuba during Barack Obama\u2019s presidency proved to be an anomaly. President Trump quickly reversed much of his predecessor\u2019s policies in order to curry favor with the Cuban American voting constituency in Miami, based on promises he made during his 2016 campaign. President Biden, despite his rhetoric during the 2020 election, has left most of Trump\u2019s sanctions in place. Washington should change course, pursuing a Cuba policy that serves U.S. national interests overall, not the parochial interests of the Cuban American population in Miami. The United States and Cuba share common interests across a number of issues that can serve as the basis for productive engagement. The United States should lift the economic embargo, or at least minimize its scope to allow greater commercial, cultural, and people-to-people engagement. For more than 60 years, the embargo has failed to overthrow the Cuban regime or foster positive change. Relaxing it would improve the lives of the Cuban people and provide new investment opportunities for American businesses. The deep cultural ties and shared interests between the United States and Cuba imply that the normalization of relations should be the ultimate policy goal. Realizing that ambition will not be easy politically, but, as Florida becomes more solidly Republican and less of a battleground state, the electoral costs of doing so are rapidly diminishing. The United States needs a foreign policy for Cuba, not a policy driven by short-term electoral calculations.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIntroduction\n\n\u201cCuba is not a foreign policy question. Cuba is a domestic issue.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Brent Scowcroft, National Security Adviser to President George H. W. Bush\n\nCampaigning in 2020, Joe Biden promised to resume Barack Obama\u2019s policy of normalizing relations with Cuba \u201cin large part.\u201d But Democrats lost big in Florida, partly because Cuban American voters made a sharp turn to the right. That setback made the Biden White House reluctant to reverse the draconian economic sanctions Donald Trump imposed on the island, despite the crippling damage done to Cuba by the COVID-19 pandemic. As the 2024 campaign ramps up, the State Department still designates Cuba as a state sponsor of terrorism, blocking its access to international financial institutions. Foreign and domestic companies still face the threat of U.S. federal lawsuits if they dare to do business with Cuba. A range of restrictions limit U.S. residents who might want to visit Cuba. Biden has continued policies aimed at choking off Cuba\u2019s access to oil, blocking Cuban contracts to provide medical services to third countries, and punishing Europeans who visit Cuba by denying them a visa waiver to enter the United States.\n\nAs foreign policy, the results have been counterproductive, to say the least. This constellation of measures has catalyzed the largest migration crisis since 1959, with over 450,000 Cubans arriving in the United States in the past two years. It has angered Latin American and European allies, and, out of desperation, has driven Cuba closer to U.S. global rivals Russia and China. And while it has exacerbated the post-pandemic humanitarian crisis in Cuba, it has done nothing to improve human rights or the prospects of a democratic opening. Such are the consequences of an international issue becoming a domestic political football.\n\nSixteen Elections and Counting\n\nFew countries have figured as prominently in U.S. elections over the years as Cuba. From the first presidential campaign after the triumph of the revolution in 1959 to the 2020 contest, candidates have raised the issue either to criticize their opponent for being soft on Cuba and foreign policy generally, or to appeal to Cuban American voters in the battleground state of Florida. As Susan Eckstein has noted, there is an \u201cethnic electoral policy cycle\u201d in U.S. policy toward Cuba.1 In election years, policy is far more likely to be driven by electoral concerns, resulting in tougher sanctions or an end to efforts to improve relations. There have been 16 U.S. presidential elections between 1960 and 2020. On six occasions, sitting presidents have tightened sanctions during an election year to bolster their party\u2019s electoral prospects:\n\nIn 1960, encouraged by Vice President and Republican candidate Richard Nixon, Dwight D. Eisenhower imposed the first trade sanctions on Cuba.\n\nIn 1964, to blunt attacks from Barry Goldwater, Lyndon B. Johnson prohibited travel to Cuba and successfully pressured the Organization of American States to adopt mandatory sanctions.\n\nIn 1992, George H. W. Bush signed the Cuban Democracy Act, further tightening the embargo, after challenger Bill Clinton endorsed it.\n\nIn 1996, Clinton signed the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act (Helms-Burton), adding new sanctions and codifying the embargo into law.\n\nIn 2004, George W. Bush imposed limits on travel and family remittances to defuse criticism from Cuban American hard-liners.\n\nIn 2020, Donald Trump did the same in hopes of mobilizing the same Cuban American constituency.\n\nOn only a single occasion has a U.S. president relaxed sanctions during an election year; in 2016, Barack Obama eased elements of the embargo as part of his broader policy of normalizing relations because he had abandoned the policy of coercive diplomacy in its entirety.2\n\nElections campaigns are not a healthy environment for diplomacy, either. On four occasions, impending U.S. elections have derailed efforts to improve relations between Washington and Havana:\n\nIn 1964, Lyndon B. Johnson abandoned John F. Kennedy\u2019s incipient dialogue with Cuba for fear of looking soft.\n\nIn 1976, Gerald Ford halted Henry Kissinger\u2019s normalization negotiations when Ronald Reagan attacked the talks as appeasement during the Republican primary campaign.\n\nIn 1979\u201380, Zbigniew Brzezinski convinced Jimmy Carter that his policy of normalization made him look soft.\n\nIn 1996, Bill Clinton reneged on his promise of dialogue after the shootdown of the Brothers to the Rescue aircraft.\n\nIn half the presidential elections since 1960, incumbent presidents have allowed perceived electoral pressure to bend their Cuba policy, either by tightening sanctions or retreating from dialogue.\n\nIn short, in half the presidential elections since 1960, incumbent presidents have allowed perceived electoral pressure to bend their Cuba policy, either by tightening sanctions or retreating from dialogue. Despite this relative consistency in policy outcomes, the politics around the Cuba issue have not been static. In the 65 years since the Cuban revolution, there have been four major shifts in the dynamics of how Cuba plays in domestic U.S. politics.\n\nIn the campaigns from the 1960s to the 1980s, Cold War themes predominated. Cuba was framed as a proxy for the Soviet Union, and a tough policy toward Cuba was seen as the hallmark of a strong foreign policy generally.\n\nThe collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War coincided with the emergence of Cuban Americans as a significant voting bloc, shifting how U.S. presidential candidates dealt with the issue. Whereas the focus on national security in earlier elections targeted the general electorate, from the 1990s onward, candidates\u2019 appeals focused on Cuban American voters with a theme of democracy and human rights.\n\nBefore 1992, Democrats saw Florida as a solidly Republican state, rarely competitive in presidential elections, and they paid scant attention to the growing Cuban American voting bloc. Bill Clinton\u2019s 1992 campaign, however, aimed to compete in Florida by appealing to Cuban Americans with a Cuba policy tougher than George H. W. Bush\u2019s. Although he did not carry Florida in 1992, he did in 1996, establishing Florida as a battleground state. Moreover, he won enough Cuban American votes that Democratic presidential candidates would follow the Clinton \u201ctough on Cuba\u201d playbook for the next three election cycles.\n\nBarack Obama broke with this conventional wisdom in 2008 by appealing to moderate members of the Cuban American community with a policy of engagement. To the surprise of many Democratic operatives, he was even more successful than Clinton, winning half the Cuban American vote in Florida in 2012, setting the stage for his dramatic decision to normalize relations with Havana in 2014. His decision to end 60 years of hostility was applauded around the world and unexpectedly popular at home, even among many Cuban Americans.\n\nThen Donald Trump, in an effort to mobilize the conservative Cuban American base of the Florida Republican Party, turned back the clock, undoing most of what Obama had done. A shift to the right in Cuban American opinion in response to Trump\u2019s leadership, and a new wave of disaffected immigrants reconfigured politics in the community, cowing moderate leaders who had supported Obama\u2019s opening.\n\nBiden has responded with a bizarre hybrid approach, relaxing some of Trump\u2019s sanctions but leaving most in place\u2014an impossible compromise between Obama\u2019s policy of coexistence and Trump\u2019s policy of regime change. The administration\u2019s watchword has been to be \u201ctough on the regime\u201d while \u201csupporting the Cuban people\u201d3\u2014as if it were possible to bankrupt the government without immiserating the population.\n\nCuba as a Cold War Symbol\n\nFrom the triumph of the revolution in 1959 through the 1980s, Cuba was both a focal point and symbol of the Cold War rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union. Because no administration was able to roll back the revolution or bend Cuban behavior to its will, Cuba was a convenient issue for challengers in presidential campaigns to invoke as an example of the incumbent administration\u2019s foreign policy weakness.\n\nIn 1960, John F. Kennedy accused the Eisenhower\u2013Nixon administration of having lost Cuba to communism (turning the tables on Republicans, who in the 1950s accused Democrats of having lost China). From August 1960 through Election Day, Cuba was a staple of Kennedy\u2019s stump speech, offered as one example in a long line of policy failures by Eisenhower and Nixon. \u201cIf you can\u2019t stand up to Castro, how can you be expected to stand up to Khrushchev?\u201d Kennedy taunted Vice President Richard Nixon on the campaign trail.4Kennedy even made Cuba the main focus of his opening statement in the fourth presidential debate.\n\nWorried that Castro\u2019s anti-American rhetoric and shift toward Moscow made him look soft, Nixon became one of the government\u2019s most outspoken advocates for economic sanctions and the paramilitary invasion that became the Bay of Pigs fiasco in 1961. Nixon wanted to launch it before the November election. \u201cIt would have been a cinch\u201d to win the election if the Eisenhower administration had been able to overthrow Fidel Castro in the closing days of the presidential campaign, explained a top Nixon campaign aide.5\n\nOnce in office, Kennedy established the basic architecture of the policy of regime change, deploying paramilitary forces, launching a wide range of covert operations, and imposing a comprehensive economic embargo that remains in place today. Washington no longer resorts to paramilitary attacks on the island (although some Cuban exiles occasionally make forays ashore), but the rest of Kennedy\u2019s policy framework has proven remarkably resilient despite having failed to achieve its stated aim.\n\nKennedy\u2019s policy framework has proven remarkably resilient despite having failed to achieve its stated aim.\n\nAs Goldwater\u2019s campaign got underway in the fall of 1963, he criticized Kennedy for promising Moscow that the United States would not attack Cuba, part of the deal that ended the 1962 missile crisis. Goldwater proposed establishing a government-in-exile at Guant\u00e1namo Naval Station and building a new exile army for yet another invasion.6Kennedy, by contrast, hoped to exploit Fidel Castro\u2019s anger over the withdrawal of Soviet missiles by offering rapprochement if Cuba would kick out the Soviets.\n\nAfter Kennedy was assassinated, President Lyndon B. Johnson broke off the talks that Kennedy had initiated. He \u201cdid not want to appear soft on anything, especially Cuba,\u201d National Security Adviser McGeorge Bundy told his staff.7Instead, Johnson successfully pushed a reluctant Organization of American States to impose mandatory sanctions against Cuba, breaking off all diplomatic and commercial relations.\n\nVietnam dominated the 1968 and 1972 presidential campaigns, but in 1975, Ronald Reagan mounted a primary challenge to President Gerald Ford, attacking the whole architecture of d\u00e9tente, especially Ford\u2019s policy toward Cuba and the Panama Canal. Reagan accused Ford and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger of \u201cworking for months, for almost a year, to buddy up to Castro, to relax tensions and have relations with Castro\u2019s Cuba.\u201d8He was not wrong. Having scored a diplomatic coup with his opening to China, Kissinger sought to extend normalization to Cuba, and negotiations to that end were underway.9\n\nReagan declared he would not talk to the Cuban government until Castro kicked out the Soviets, agreed to let the United States keep Guant\u00e1namo Naval Station, restored democratic rights, and stopped \u201cexporting his revolution to other countries.\u201d10Ford countered by breaking off Kissinger\u2019s negotiations. \u201cLet me say categorically and emphatically,\u201d he declared during a campaign stop in Florida, \u201cthe United States will have nothing to do with Castro\u2019s Cuba\u2014period.\u201d11\n\nAsked later what had derailed Kissinger\u2019s attempted rapprochement, a Cuban official replied, \u201cYour elections.\u201d12\n\nWhen Jimmy Carter assumed office, he reopened the normalization dialogue with Havana, but it was soon derailed by Cuba\u2019s military involvement in Africa. Warned by National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski that Havana\u2019s African adventures made the president look weak, Carter retreated to the traditional policy of hostility as the 1980 election approached.\n\nIn 1980, Reagan renewed his attack on d\u00e9tente and again held up Cuba as proof of the incumbent\u2019s weakness. \u201cIt\u2019s time to stop pretending that d\u00e9tente with the Soviet Union is still alive while it arms Cubans to the teeth and sends them to secure Soviet beachheads in the third world,\u201d Reagan said in his stump speech. \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t we blockade Cuba and then say to the Soviets, \u2018When your troops get out of Afghanistan, we will drop the blockade around Cuba?\u2019\u201d Carter had been foolish, Reagan said, to offer Cuba \u201ca hand of friendship\u201d to normalize relations.13\n\nThe Mariel migration crisis in the summer of 1980 shifted the debate from Cuba\u2019s alleged role as a Soviet proxy to its threat to border security. Carter\u2019s inability to control the southern border\u2014following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the seizure of American hostages in Iran\u2014reinforced the public\u2019s perception that the president was incapable of defending U.S. interests. \u201cCarter couldn\u2019t get the Russians to move out of Cuba,\u201d Reagan quipped, \u201cso he\u2019s moving out the Cubans.\u201d14\n\nCuba Becomes a Domestic Political Issue\n\nThe 1980 election marked an inflection point after which presidential candidates targeted their messages on Cuba not to the electorate as a whole but to one specific bloc of highly motivated voters\u2014Cuban Americans in Florida. The theme of Cuba as a proxy for the Soviet Union disappeared with the end of the Cold War. But the Cuban exilio still cared deeply about U.S. policy toward the island. They put their money and their growing electoral power behind candidates who agreed with them\u2014and punished those who did not.\n\nThe 1980 election marked an inflection point after which presidential candidates targeted their messages on Cuba not to the electorate as a whole but to one specific bloc of highly motivated voters\u2014Cuban Americans in Florida.\n\nBefore the 1980s, the Cuban diaspora in the United States was too small to make any difference in presidential elections, but the first stirrings of political activism were visible more than a decade earlier. With the passage of the Cuban Adjustment Act in 1966, more and more exiles became permanent residents and then citizens. As the community faced the reality that there was little chance of deposing Fidel Castro, activist members turned their attention first to local and then national politics. Miami was home to both Cuban Americans for Nixon in 1968 and 1972, and Cuban Americans for McGovern in 1972.\n\nThe number of eligible Cuban voters in Florida was still too small in the 1960s and early 1970s to affect the outcome of most statewide elections. In 1968, eligible Cuban voters were only 1 percent of the eligible Florida electorate, and only about half of those were registered.15But the rate at which they were registering foreshadowed their future influence, and it did not bode well for Democrats. In predominantly Cuban precincts in Miami-Dade in 1968, Nixon and segregationist Alabama Governor George Wallace, running as an independent, together won 60 percent of the Cuban American vote. (see table 1).16\n\nBy 1976, the number of Cuban American eligible voters in Florida had doubled since the 1970 Census, comprising about 4 percent of the state\u2019s eligible voters. Those seeking naturalization jumped four-fold from previous years. \u201cThere was a time when becoming an American citizen was regarded by some older leaders as unpatriotic,\u201d explained Alfredo Duran, Bay of Pigs veteran and chair of the Florida Democratic Party. \u201cNow, everybody wants to have an American passport and the right to vote.\u201d17For the first time, Cuban American voters were a large enough constituency\u2014some 23 percent of registered Republicans in Dade County\u2014to potentially decide Florida\u2019s Republican primary.\n\nPresidential candidates campaigning in South Florida learned to expect questions about their stance on Cuba. A 1983 poll found that intensely anti-Castro attitudes dominated the Cuban American community. Seventy-eight percent agreed that the United States should provide arms and training to groups trying to overthrow Castro, and two-thirds favored a U.S. invasion of the island.18 From 1993 to 2016, the Florida International University poll of Cuban Americans in South Florida asked how important a candidate\u2019s position on Cuba was in determining their vote. Consistently, majorities ranging from 64 to 78 percent deemed it important, and 37 to 48 percent deemed it very important.19\u201cPerhaps only in South Florida\u2019s Cuban community could candidates for city council, circuit judge, and state legislator win or lose an election solely on the basis of their foreign policy platforms,\u201d wrote Miguel Gonz\u00e1lez-Pando in his history of the Cuban American community.20\n\nGerald Ford won the 1976 Florida primary with 53 percent of the vote to Reagan\u2019s 47 percent, but Reagan won the Cuban American vote handily, 71 to 29 percent.21Four years later, Reagan went after the Cuban American vote aggressively. Campaigning in Miami\u2019s \u201cLittle Havana\u201d on the eve of the Florida Republican primary, Reagan attended the annual Calle de Ocho festival, laid a wreath at the monument to the exiles killed at the Bay of Pigs, and then held a news conference limited to Cuban American journalists, where he criticized the Carter administration for \u201charassing \u2026 those who are sympathetic with the freeing of Cuba\u201d\u2014a reference to federal investigations of a wave of terrorist bombings and assassinations by Cuban exile paramilitary groups in New York and Miami.22In November 1980, Reagan carried Florida 55 to 35 percent, winning 80 percent of the Cuban American vote (see table 1).\n\nCreating a constituency\n\nEarly in the first Reagan administration, Richard V. Allen, Reagan\u2019s national security adviser, encouraged a group of wealthy exiles to create the Cuban American National Foundation (CANF), which became one of the most powerful ethnic foreign policy organizations in the United States. It so dominated Cuban American politics in South Florida that it was known to all simply as \u201cla Fundaci\u00f3n.\u201d23The Cuban American community went from being a relatively small, disorganized electorate only influential in primaries, to being a highly organized political force and key component of the Republican base in Florida general elections. It also provided vocal support for Reagan\u2019s policies toward Cuba and Central America.\n\nThe Cuban American community went from being a relatively small, disorganized electorate only influential in primaries, to being a highly organized political force and key component of the Republican base in Florida general elections.\n\nIn the year leading up to the 1984 election, 75 percent of new Cuban American voters registered as Republicans in Dade County, and the total number of registered Republicans among Cuban Americans overtook the total number of Democrats. In November, Reagan won between 88 and 93 percent of the Cuban American vote in Florida. \u201cReagan\u2019s anti-Communist rhetoric is so strong that the Cubans are simply in love with him,\u201d admitted Alfredo Duran.24\n\nThe 1988 campaign offered conservative Cuban Americans an opportunity to flex their newfound political muscle. Reagan imposed no new sanctions on Cuba during his second term and negotiated the resumption of a migration agreement suspended since 1984. \u201cReagan came into office like Rambo, but now he is acting more like Mickey Mouse,\u201d groused Tomas Garcia Fuste, news director at Miami\u2019s most popular Spanish-language radio station.25On a campaign trip to Miami for George H. W. Bush, Reagan was met by 250 angry protesters while airplanes circled overhead with banners reading, \u201cNo Negotiations with Cuba\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t Play with Words\u2013Stop Talking With Castro.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs far as this administration is concerned, freedom for Cuba, liberty for her people, is a non-negotiable demand,\u201d Reagan promised at the campaign event. \u201cSo long as Cuba remains an inhuman communist dungeon \u2026 there cannot and must not be any normalization of relations.\u201d26\n\nCuban Americans\u2019 frustration with the Reagan-Bush administration\u2019s Cuba policy did not redound to the benefit of Democrats, however. \u201cThe idea that Cuba has been abandoned as a priority foreign policy goal is a cause of great disgust, I guess, or dissatisfaction,\u201d noted Miami Mayor Xavier Su\u00e1rez, but \u201cnot enough to make anyone switch to the opponents.\u201d27Another Cuban American put it this way: \u201cMost of us are one-issue voters, and we vote for the candidate who hates Castro the most. And this time that\u2019s clearly Bush.\u201d28In the general election against Michael Dukakis, Bush won 85 percent of the Cuban American vote in Florida (see table 1).\n\nClinton-Bush, 1992: The Cuban Democracy Act\n\nThe 1992 presidential election was a watershed for the Cuba issue in U.S. presidential elections. The Cuban American community\u2019s anti-communism had led it to support Republicans by wide margins, so Democrats paid little attention to it before 1992. Moreover, Florida was not generally regarded as a swing state. Since Harry Truman\u2019s victory in 1948, Democrats had won the state only twice (Johnson in 1964 and Carter in 1976). Walter Mondale made just one campaign stop in Florida after his nomination in 1984, and Dukakis scaled back campaign operations there two months before the 1988 election.\n\nAs former governor of Arkansas, Bill Clinton was determined to break the Republicans\u2019 hold on the South, and Florida was among his targets. Florida\u2019s electorate was more heterogeneous than that of other Southern states\u2014retirees from the Northeast, Latinos from various countries, Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Haitians, and more. Population growth also made it more important. In 1960, it had just 10 electoral votes; by 1992, it had 25\u2014the fourth largest behind California, New York, and Texas. For a Republican, finding a path to victory without Florida had become nearly impossible.\n\nThe political weight of Cuban Americans had also grown dramatically during the Reagan-Bush years. \u201cIn a close general election in which Cuban-Americans turn out more heavily than anyone else, they can give a Republican candidate a net gain of up to six percentage points,\u201d noted Robert Joffee, director of the Mason-Dixon Florida Poll.29Clinton did not expect to win the Cuban American vote, but he aimed to win enough of it that the Democrats\u2019 advantage among the elderly, non-Cuban Latinos, and African Americans would carry the state.\n\nEarly in the campaign, Clinton saw an opportunity to outflank President Bush on the right. A bill to tighten the embargo, the Cuban Democracy Act, was working its way through Congress, sponsored by two Democrats, Representative Robert Torricelli of New Jersey and Senator Bob Graham of Florida. President Bush opposed the bill because its extraterritorial provisions threatened to damage relations with U.S. allies.\n\nOn April 23, 1992, Clinton attended a fundraiser at Victor\u2019s Caf\u00e9 in the heart of Little Havana with 300 of Miami\u2019s wealthiest Cuban Americans. \u201cI think this administration has missed a big opportunity to put the hammer down on Fidel Castro and Cuba,\u201d Clinton told the largely Republican audience. \u201cI have read the Torricelli-Graham bill and I like it.\u201d Clinton\u2019s campaign raised $125,000 that evening.30\n\nClinton\u2019s gambit was carefully orchestrated by Torricelli and Cuban American National Foundation President Jorge Mas Canosa. Mas sent word to Clinton in March that if he would endorse the CDA, Mas would open the doors to the Cuban American community for him, which, not coincidentally, would pressure Bush to support the bill.31\n\nIt worked. Less than two weeks after Clinton\u2019s Miami endorsement, Bush announced that he, too, supported the CDA. Signing the bill in Miami, Bush declared, \u201cFor freedom to rise in Cuba, Fidel Castro must fall. \u2026 Our policy is the only way to put it, plain and simple: Democracy, Mr. Castro, not sometime, not someday, but now.\u201d32Clinton, however, had established his bona fides as tough on Cuba. In September, 13 Cuban American members of the Dade County Republican Party Executive Committee broke with their party to endorse Clinton because they believed he would do more to rid Cuba of Fidel Castro than Bush.33 Less than a week before the election, CANF leaders issued a statement praising Clinton\u2019s \u201cdeep-seated commitment to continue exerting pressure on the Castro regime.\u201d Most importantly, the statement concluded, \u201cWe need not fear a Bill Clinton administration.\u201d34\n\nNevertheless, on Election Day, most Cuban Americans still voted their traditional Republican loyalty; Bush won 71 percent of their votes to just 22 percent for Clinton (see table 1). Bush carried Florida by only 100,000 votes, a victory so narrow that Cuban Americans could rightly claim credit for it, but Clinton won nationwide. The lesson that Democratic political operatives took from 1992 was that a tough stand on Cuba could erode Republican support among Cuban Americans enough to put Florida in play, forcing Republicans to devote time and money there instead of elsewhere. Florida had become a swing state.\n\nClinton-Dole, 1996: Helms-Burton\n\nIn 1994 and 1995, President Clinton signed migration agreements with Cuba to stanch the flow of undocumented refugees that began with the \u201crafters crisis\u201d in the summer of 1994 when thousands of Cubans, desperate to escape the economic depression in Cuba caused by the collapse of European Communism, tried to reach the United States on homemade rafts. To prevent Clinton from taking further steps to improve relations, Republican Senator Jesse Helms and Congressman Dan Burton introduced the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act (known simply as Helms-Burton). It was designed to block foreign investment in Cuba, tighten the embargo, and prohibit its repeal until Cuba became a free-market democracy. At first, Clinton opposed the bill and threatened to veto it because it infringed on the president\u2019s constitutional authority to make foreign policy.\n\nThen, on February 24, two Cessna aircraft from the Cuban American group Brothers to the Rescue were shot down by Cuban MiG fighters as they approached Cuban airspace. All four pilots were killed. The shootdown drastically altered the political environment in Washington. \u201cClinton has tried to cozy up to Castro for three years,\u201d charged Republican senator and presidential candidate Robert Dole.35Campaigning in Miami with the Florida primary just weeks away, Dole demanded that \u201cthe murderers\u201d responsible for the shootdown be indicted, convicted, and executed.36\n\nIn the White House, the president\u2019s political advisers argued that he had no choice but to sign the Helms-Burton bill despite his objections to it. On March 12, 1996, Clinton signed it into law and handed the pen to Jorge Mas Canosa as a souvenir. \u201cSupporting the bill was good election-year politics in Florida,\u201d Clinton wrote in his autobiography, \u201cbut it undermined whatever chance I might have if I won a second term to lift the embargo in return for positive changes within Cuba.\u201d37\n\nIn November, Clinton won between 35 and 40 percent of the Cuban American vote\u2014the best showing since Jimmy Carter in 1976\u2014although he carried Florida by such a wide margin that he would have won the state even if he had done no better in 1996 among Cuban Americans than he had in 1992. The result reinforced the conventional wisdom among Democrats that they had to be just as tough as Republicans on Cuba so that Cuban Americans would vote based on other issues, where Democrats held the advantage.38\n\nGore\u2013Bush, 2000: Eli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez\n\nThe 2000 presidential campaign had just begun when five-year-old Eli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez was found floating in an inner tube in the Florida Strait on Thanksgiving Day, 1999. His mother and 10 others drowned when a small smugglers\u2019 boat capsized en route from Cuba to Miami. The Immigration and Naturalization Service released the boy into the custody of his great-uncle Lazaro Gonz\u00e1lez in Miami, but his father in Cuba, Juan Miguel Gonz\u00e1lez, wanted his son back. The \u201cMiami relatives,\u201d as they came to be known, refused to give him up. Eli\u00e1n became a symbol to the Cuban American community in Miami. A Miami Herald poll found that 91 percent of Cuban Americans in South Florida believed that Eli\u00e1n should stay in the United States.39 \u201cSince the Bay of Pigs, there hasn\u2019t been an issue of this level of importance to Cuban American voters,\u201d said Washington pollster Rob Schroth.40\n\nAfter determining that Eli\u00e1n\u2019s father was a good parent, the Clinton administration ruled that Eli\u00e1n should be returned to him.41Angry Republicans on Capitol Hill introduced legislation to give Eli\u00e1n U.S. citizenship, accusing the Clinton administration of wanting to \u201cappease the Castro regime.\u201d42Republican presidential candidates George W. Bush and John McCain argued that Eli\u00e1n\u2019s father should be required to come to the United States to claim custody, and Bush voiced support for the congressional effort to make Eli\u00e1n a citizen by an act of Congress.43On the Democratic side, Al Gore said that he favored \u201cwhatever is in the best interests of the child,\u201d without venturing an opinion as to what that might be.44\n\nIn April, Juan Miguel Gonz\u00e1lez did come to the United States to pick up Eli\u00e1n, but the Miami relatives ignored a federal order to surrender him. Alex Penelas, the Democratic mayor of Miami-Dade County, warned that Cuban Americans would hold Gore accountable if Clinton returned Eli\u00e1n to Cuba. The Cuban American National Foundation threatened to work actively to defeat Gore. \u201cIf Eli\u00e1n gets sent back,\u201d said Jim Nicholson, chair of the Republican National Committee, \u201cthe Cuban community will remember which party wanted to hand a small child back to Fidel Castro across a barbed-wire fence.\u201d45\n\nAs the Department of Justice negotiated with the Miami relatives, Gore suddenly broke with the administration, declaring that Eli\u00e1n should stay in the United States.46 Gore\u2019s gambit was so obviously designed to appeal to Cuban American voters that it reinforced one of his major weaknesses\u2014the public\u2019s perception that he was an unprincipled opportunist. Gallup found that the public disapproved of Gore\u2019s handling of Eli\u00e1n\u2019s case by a two-to-one margin.47\u201cHe turned off a great number of voters nationally because they considered him to be pandering to the Cuban-American community,\u201d said pollster Sergio Bendixen, \u201cand he didn\u2019t gain any Cuban-American support.\u201d48\n\nAt 5:15 a.m. on April 22, 2000, an Immigration and Naturalization Service SWAT team broke into the Miami relatives\u2019 house and spirited Eli\u00e1n away. For many Cuban Americans, the forcible removal of the boy from his Miami relatives and his return to Cuba produced a deep sense of betrayal. Gore tried to recover by picking Democratic Senator Joe Lieberman of Connecticut as his running mate. Lieberman had been a close friend of CANF president Jorge Mas Canosa, who died in 1997. In 1988, donations from CANF\u2019s directors helped Lieberman narrowly defeat incumbent Senator Lowell Weicker; from then on, Lieberman was one of the top recipients of campaign donations from Cuban American hard-liners.49\n\nCampaigning in Little Havana, Lieberman pledged that a Gore administration would not relax sanctions on Cuba.50Gore declared himself \u201ca hard-liner,\u201d adding, \u201cI do not favor any openings to the Castro government.\u201d51But Lieberman\u2019s friendship with the Cuban American right was not enough to overcome the trauma of Eli\u00e1n\u2019s return to Cuba. \u201cIt was humiliating to Cuban Americans,\u201d noted pollster Sergio Bendixen, \u201cand the 2000 election was payback.\u201d They called it \u201cel voto castigo\u201d\u2014the punishment vote.52In November, Al Gore won only about 23 percent of the Cuban American vote, losing Florida and the presidency by just 537 votes.\n\n\u201cI had worked for eight years to strengthen our position in the state and among Cuban Americans,\u201d Bill Clinton lamented in his memoir, \u201cand the Eli\u00e1n case had wiped out most of our gains.\u201d53\n\nKerry\u2013Bush, 2004: The Commission for Assistance to a Free Cuba\n\nThe pivotal role that Cuban Americans played in George W. Bush\u2019s razor-thin victory in 2000 raised expectations that Bush would toughen U.S. sanctions. When, after three years in office, nothing much had changed, conservative Cuban Americans became increasingly disaffected. In July 2003, 13 Florida legislators, 11 of them Cuban Americans, wrote to Bush, warning that if he did not deliver on his campaign promise to increase pressure on Cuba, \u201cWe fear the historic and intense support from Cuban American voters for Republican federal candidates, including yourself, will be jeopardized.\u201d54Governor Jeb Bush, the president\u2019s brother, underscored the seriousness of the political risk by publicly acknowledging that Washington had no \u201ccoherent policy\u201d toward Cuba.55\n\nA March 2004 Univision poll of South Florida Hispanic voters, a majority of whom were Cuban, disapproved of the job Bush had done \u201cpromoting democracy and regime change\u201d in Cuba. A second poll of Miami-Dade Republican voters found that while 88 percent supported Bush, 70 percent agreed that he had not done enough to pressure Cuba, suggesting that his support was soft. \u201cThere will be a real fight for the Cuban exile vote,\u201d predicted pollster Bendixen.56\n\nDemocratic aspirants saw Cuban American frustration as an opportunity. As if on cue, they began toughening their own stance on Cuba. Three years earlier, Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, had said that a reassessment of the embargo was \u201clong overdue,\u201d and that U.S. policy remained frozen \u201cbecause of the power of the Cuban American lobby.\u201d But in September 2003 on Meet the Press, when asked if he would lift U.S. sanctions, he replied, \u201cI don\u2019t like Fidel Castro. I wouldn\u2019t just give him a reward for nothing, no.\u201d Instead, Kerry suggested increasing U.S. support for dissidents.57\n\nPresidents have a unique advantage in a campaign. Challengers can only make promises; the president can act. On May 6, 2004, Bush\u2019s special presidential Commission on Assistance to Free Cuba issued its first report, recommending a menu of policy options \u201cto bring about an expeditious end to the Castro dictatorship.\u201d58 President Bush promptly accepted them all.\n\nThe new sanctions had a significant impact on Cuban Americans, restricting both family travel and remittances. The new policy was the product of an intense debate inside the administration between those who advocated even tougher measures like cutting off remittances entirely, and those who feared the humanitarian impact that would have on Cuban families.59The final policy package was a political gamble. By catering to Cuban American hard-liners\u2019 demands to put maximum pressure on the Castro government, Bush risked alienating members of the community whose ability to visit family and send remittances was being limited. This was not a small group. A 2004 poll by Florida International University among Cubans living in South Florida found that 36.5 percent had visited Cuba and 53.6 percent had sent family remittances.60\n\nIn fact, a significant part of the community opposed the restrictions; even the Cuban American National Foundation criticized them.61 A Southwest Voter Registration Education Project poll found that while 59 percent of Cuban Americans supported Bush\u2019s policy overall, 37 percent opposed limiting family visits to once every three years, and 64 percent opposed the elimination of emergency visits. Responses were polarized between older, Cuban-born respondents who arrived in the United States before 1980 on the one side, and younger, more recent arrivals and respondents born in the United States on the other. The older group, who had fewer immediate family still on the island, favored the harsh sanctions by wide margins.62 Sanction supporters were more likely to be naturalized U.S. citizens, more likely to be registered to vote, and more likely to turn out to vote, than sanctions opponents.\n\nA month after the new sanctions were unveiled, a Bendixen poll found that Kerry was leading Bush 40 to 29 percent among Cubans who arrived after 1980 (with 31 percent undecided) and by 58 to 32 percent among Cuban Americans born in the United States (10 percent undecided). But among those who arrived before 1980, who constituted two-thirds of Cuban American eligible voters, Bush held a dominant 89 to 8 percent lead, with just 3 percent undecided. Those favoring Kerry constituted just 25 percent of the Cuban American electorate.63Bush\u2019s gamble had paid off.\n\nKerry tried to exploit the split in the community by reorienting his appeal toward opponents of Bush\u2019s sanctions, attacking the new initiative as a \u201ccynical and misguided ploy for a few Florida votes\u201d that \u201cpunishes and isolates the Cuban people.\u201d As an alternative, he offered \u201cselective engagement,\u201d including \u201cprincipled travel\u201d by Cuban Americans, unlimited remittances, and educational and cultural exchanges.64 It didn\u2019t work. Bush won 75 percent of the Cuban American vote in Florida to John Kerry\u2019s 25 percent, and once again, the state gave Bush his Electoral College majority (see table 1). But Kerry\u2019s strategy of appealing to moderate Cuban Americans with a policy supporting family engagement foreshadowed Barack Obama\u2019s approach four years later.\n\nObama\u2013McCain, 2008: Appealing to moderates\n\nBarack Obama took a radically new approach to Cuba, abandoning the traditional Democratic strategy of trying to be tougher than Republicans. Instead, he offered a policy of diplomatic and people-to-people engagement focused on Cuban American families, arguing that the policy of the previous 50 years had failed. The electoral logic underlying Obama\u2019s strategy was still aimed at winning enough Cuban American votes to put Florida in play, but Obama\u2019s appeal was new, premised on the shift in Cuban American opinion produced by demographic change.\n\nThe electoral logic underlying Obama\u2019s strategy was still aimed at winning enough Cuban American votes to put Florida in play, but Obama\u2019s appeal was new, premised on the shift in Cuban American opinion produced by demographic change.\n\nWhen Florida International University began polling Cuban Americans in South Florida in 1991, 87 percent favored continuing the U.S. embargo. By 2007, support had fallen to 58 percent. In 1993, 75 percent opposed selling food to Cuba, and 50 percent opposed selling medicine. By 2007, solid majorities\u201462 percent and 72 percent respectively\u2014supported both.65\n\nExiles who arrived in the United States in the 1960s and 1970s, the \u201chistorical exile,\u201d came as political refugees, motivated principally by their opposition to the socialist direction of the revolution. Those who arrived in the Mariel exodus in 1980 and afterwards were more likely to have left for economic reasons and to have maintained ties with family on the island. A 2007 poll found that fewer than half of those who arrived before 1985 were sending remittances to the island, whereas three-quarters of more recent arrivals were. In 2007, the voter registration rate for those who arrived before 1985 was over 90 percent, whereas for post\u2013Cold War arrivals who were citizens, the rate was only 60 percent.66 But as more and more of the post\u20131980 immigrants obtained citizenship, and as the number of Cuban Americans born in the United States rose (reaching half the Cuban American electorate by 2010), the electoral potential of the community\u2019s moderate wing became unmistakable. In 2008, Cuban Americans were 6.6 percent of the Florida electorate.\n\nBush\u2019s 2004 limits on family visits and remittances brought these differences in the community to the surface. In late 2006, 20 Cuban American organizations, including the Cuban American National Foundation, called on Bush to relax restrictions on travel and humanitarian assistance.67 By 2007, 64 percent of Cuban Americans in South Florida wanted the restrictions lifted, and 41 percent reported that the restrictions had an impact on them personally.68\n\nObama laid out his Cuba policy in a 2007 opinion editorial in the Miami Herald, taking pains to assure Cuban Americans he was not soft on the Castros. \u201cA democratic opening in Cuba is, and should be, the foremost objective of our policy,\u201d he wrote. But he criticized Bush\u2019s policy as \u201cposturing\u201d that had further entrenched the regime by cutting off outside contact, especially with Cuban Americans. \u201cCuban-American connections to family in Cuba are not only a basic right in humanitarian terms,\u201d Obama wrote, \u201cbut also our best tool for helping to foster the beginnings of grass-roots democracy on the island.\u201d He promised to lift all restrictions on family travel and remittances and to pursue \u201caggressive and principled diplomacy\u201d to convince the Cuban government to begin a process of democratization in exchange for better relations with Washington.69 McCain, by contrast, opposed any changes in Bush\u2019s policy, promising to keep the embargo in place and attacking Obama\u2019s willingness to open a dialogue with Cuban leaders.70\n\nObama\u2019s position on family engagement was in sync with the evolving views of the Cuban American National Foundation\u2019s leadership, led since the death of founder Jorge Mas Canosa by his son Jorge Mas Santos. In May 2008, CANF invited Obama, Clinton, and McCain to address its Cuban Independence Day celebration. Only Obama accepted. \u201cIt\u2019s time for more than tough talk that never yields results. It\u2019s time for a new strategy,\u201d Obama declared to a crowd of some 900. \u201cThere are no better ambassadors for freedom than Cuban Americans.\u201d71 He received several standing ovations. Just two weeks before the election, Jorge Mas Santos published an op-ed in the Miami Herald echoing Obama\u2019s critique of the Bush-McCain policy and endorsing a new strategy very much like Obama\u2019s.72\n\nIn November, Obama matched Bill Clinton\u2019s 1996 mark by winning roughly 35 percent of the Cuban American vote in Florida, proving the effectiveness of his appeal for engagement. Exit polling found that while 84 percent of South Florida Cuban American voters 65 or older voted for McCain, 55 percent of those 29 or younger backed Obama.73Yet as innovative and successful as Obama\u2019s strategy proved to be, it made no difference in the outcome of the election. Voters nationwide punished the Republican Party for the 2008 financial crisis, giving Obama a winning margin of 192 votes in the Electoral College, making Florida\u2019s electoral votes irrelevant. Obama carried Florida, but by such a large margin that he would have won the state even if he had drawn just 20 percent of the Cuban American vote.\n\nObama\u2013Romney, 2012: Invisible island\n\nDuring his first year in the White House, Obama kept his campaign promise to lift all restrictions on Cuban American travel and remittances, renewed diplomatic conversations with Havana on issues of mutual interest, and declared to other hemispheric heads of state at the Summit of the Americas that he wanted a \u201cnew beginning\u201d in U.S.-Cuban relations. But before his new policy could gain momentum, it was stopped dead in December 2009 by the arrest in Cuba of USAID \u201cdemocracy promotion\u201d subcontractor Alan Gross.74Relations remained frozen for the next three years.\n\nDomestic issues\u2014recovery from the 2008 Great Recession and the controversial Affordable Care Act (a.k.a. Obamacare)\u2014dominated the campaign agenda in 2012. The topic of Cuba flared briefly during the Republican primaries as Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich vied for the Cuban American primary vote, but it was not a prominent issue in the general election. Obama\u2019s pro-family policies on travel and remittances were popular in Miami, and he had done little else because of Gross\u2019s imprisonment. On more than a half-dozen campaign trips to Florida, Obama never once mentioned Cuba, and even though the final presidential debate was held in Florida and devoted to foreign policy, there was not a single question about Cuba.\n\nClinton\u2013Trump, 2016: The art of the deal\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s 2014 decision to reestablish diplomatic relations and begin a broader process of normalizing relations with Cuba set in motion a series of events lasting for the rest of his term in office. In 2015 and 2016, the administration announced regulatory reforms relaxing elements of the embargo, removed Cuba from the list of state sponsors of international terrorism, and restored full diplomatic relations. Cuba was invited to the Seventh Summit of the Americas, where Obama and Ra\u00fal Castro met for their first substantive discussion. In just two years, Washington and Havana signed 22 bilateral accords on issues of mutual interest. In 2016, Obama became the first U.S. president to visit Cuba since Calvin Coolidge in 1928.\n\nRepublican presidential aspirants in 2016 were nearly unanimous in their opposition to Obama\u2019s opening. Every new development in the normalization process prompted more hyperbolic Republican denunciations, especially from the two Cuban American candidates, Republican Senators Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas.75Rubio called Obama \u201cthe single worst negotiator we have had in the White House in my lifetime,\u201d arguing that the president gave the Cuban government \u201ceverything it asked for\u201d and got nothing in return. \u201cI am committed to doing everything I can do to unravel as many of these changes as possible,\u201d he added.76Cruz, burnishing his own Cuban American credentials, said of the new policy, \u201cFidel and Ra\u00fal Castro have just received both international legitimacy and a badly-needed economic lifeline from President Obama.\u201d77Republican Governor Jeb Bush of Florida called the opening a \u201cmisstep\u201d that \u201cundermines America\u2019s credibility and undermines the quest for a free and democratic Cuba.\u201d78Donald Trump was equivocal.\n\nAt first, Cuba did not gain traction as a major campaign issue because support for Obama\u2019s opening was so widespread. A CBS\u2013New York Times poll taken right after the December 17, 2014, announcement found that 54 percent of the public approved of both reestablishing diplomatic relations and allowing trade with Cuba, while only 28 percent disapproved. Other polls found similar results.79Seven months later, support for Obama\u2019s policy had grown, with 73 percent of the public in favor of diplomatic relations and 72 percent in favor of ending the embargo, according to a Pew Research poll. A majority of Republicans agreed (56 percent and 59 percent in favor respectively), as did even self-identified conservative Republicans (52 percent and 55 percent in favor).80\n\nMoreover, the new policy found significant support among Cuban Americans. A Bendixen & Amandi national poll in March 2015 found 51 percent of Cuban Americans in support of normalization and a plurality of 47 percent in favor of lifting the embargo. Those living in Florida supported Obama\u2019s policy (52 percent in favor, 40 percent opposed).81A Florida International University poll in the summer of 2016, after Obama\u2019s trip to Cuba, found that support for normalization among Cuban Americans in South Florida had grown to 56 percent and support for ending the embargo to 54 percent.82\n\nHillary Clinton, who had taken a tough stance on Cuba in the 2008 campaign, now embraced normalization. In July 2015, she gave a major speech in Miami echoing Obama\u2019s argument that the embargo was a failure that should be ended, and she promised to expand on his policy of engagement. She did not shy away from arguing that engagement would weaken the Cuban regime and hasten its demise. The embargo had only strengthened the hand of hard-liners in Havana, \u201chelping the regime keep Cuba a closed and controlled society rather than working to open it up to positive outside influences,\u201d she said. \u201cEngagement is not a gift to the Castros\u2014it\u2019s a threat to the Castros.\u201d83\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s campaign was never heavy on policy details, and Cuba was no exception. At first, he supported Obama\u2019s policy, albeit with a caveat. \u201cFifty years is enough,\u201d he said in late 2015. \u201cThe concept of opening with Cuba is fine, but we should have made a better deal.\u201d84A few months later, during the March 2016 Republican primary debate, he stumbled through a question about Cuba, concluding, \u201cI would want to make a good deal, I would want to make a strong, solid, good deal because right now, everything is in Cuba\u2019s favor. \u2026 All we do is keep giving. We give and give and give. \u2026 I would probably have the embassy closed until such time as a really good deal was made and struck by the United States.\u201d85Less than two weeks later, he told CNN that he would probably maintain diplomatic relations. \u201cMaybe it won\u2019t work out, but I will tell you, I think Cuba has a certain potential, and I think it\u2019s OK to bring Cuba into the fold.\u201d86\n\nTrump said little more about Cuba until September 2016, when Newsweek magazine broke the story that, in 1998, Trump secretly explored the possibility of opening business operations in Cuba, in violation of the U.S. embargo, and then tried to disguise the illegal activity as an allowable charitable project.87At that same time, Trump was flirting with running for president on Ross Perot\u2019s Reform Party ticket, and delivered a fiery speech to Cuban Americans in Miami, denouncing Fidel Castro as \u201ca killer\u201d and pledging to maintain the embargo.88The Clinton campaign jumped on the story as yet another example of Trump\u2019s dishonesty and habit of putting his personal business interests ahead of the national interest.89Trump hurried to Miami to shore up his support among Cuban Americans and shortly thereafter announced a new Cuba policy via Twitter: \u201cThe people of Cuba have struggled too long. Will reverse Obama\u2019s executive orders and concessions towards Cuba until freedoms are restored.\u201d90\n\nCampaigning in Miami, Trump and Pence both pledged to roll back Obama\u2019s policy in its entirety.91\u201cAll of the concessions that Barack Obama has granted the Castro regime were done with executive order, which means the next president can reverse them,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd that is what I will do unless the Castro regime meets our demands.\u201d92In October, Trump was endorsed by the Bay of Pigs Veterans Association.\n\nIn the end, Trump\u2019s appeal to Cuban Americans had limited success. According to exit polls, he won somewhere between 52 percent and 54 percent of their votes, only slightly better than Mitt Romney had done in 2012.93By contrast, in the predominately white rural counties along the I-4 corridor and in the Florida panhandle, Trump crushed Clinton by huge margins. Trump won Florida the same way he won Pennsylvania, Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin: white blue-collar workers, fed up with politics and politicians ignoring their needs, turned out in record numbers for him.94\n\nYet Trump believed he owed Cuban Americans a political debt. When Fidel Castro died on November 26, 2016, President-Elect Trump condemned the Cuban leader. \u201cI join the many Cuban Americans who supported me so greatly in the presidential campaign \u2026 with the hope of one day soon seeing a free Cuba.\u201d95Two days later, he tweeted, \u201cIf Cuba is unwilling to make a better deal for the Cuban people, the Cuban/American people and the U.S. as a whole, I will terminate deal.\u201d96\n\nBiden\u2013Trump, 2020: Do no harm\n\nPresident Trump kept his 2016 campaign promise to reverse Obama\u2019s policy of engagement. Speaking to a cheering crowd of Cuban exiles in Miami on July 17, 2017, Trump declared, \u201cEffective immediately, I am canceling the last administration\u2019s completely one-sided deal with Cuba.\u201d He imposed an initial round of sanctions limiting \u201cpeople-to-people\u201d educational travel and prohibiting transactions with a long list of Cuban enterprises managed by the armed forces, including major hotels where most U.S. tour groups stayed.97In September, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson downsized the U.S. embassy in Havana after two dozen U.S. personnel reported suffering unexplained neurological symptoms\u2014the so-called Havana Syndrome.98The embassy\u2019s consular section stopped processing Cuban visa requests and suspended both the Family Reunification Program and the refugee program. Immigrant visas issued at the Havana Embassy fell from 9,752 in FY 2017 to just 29 in FY 2018 and zero in FY 2019 and 2020.99Pressured by Marco Rubio, Tillerson also expelled an equivalent group of Cuban diplomats from Washington.\n\nIn 2019, the Trump administration launched a \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign to cut off Cuba\u2019s principal sources of foreign currency in hopes of collapsing the Cuban economy and the regime along with it. To deter foreign investors, Trump activated Title III of the 1996 Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act, enabling U.S. nationals, including Cuban Americans, to sue Cuban, U.S., or foreign companies in U.S. federal court for using property nationalized after the 1959 revolution. The administration targeted Cuba\u2019s energy supply by imposing sanctions on companies shipping Venezuelan oil to Cuba. The State Department pressured countries to cancel their medical assistance contracts with Cuba or risk losing U.S. assistance, and conservative governments in Brazil, Ecuador, Bolivia, and El Salvador quickly obliged.\n\nTrump\u2019s most serious sanctions focused on travel and remittances. The administration eliminated the people-to-people travel category entirely, blocking most non-Cuban American travelers. It severed commercial and charter air links to all Cuban cities except Havana, and halted visits by U.S. cruise ships, which carried some 800,000 people to Cuba in 2018. Remittances, unlimited under Obama, were capped at $1,000 per quarter, and, just weeks before the 2020 presidential election, Trump blocked Cuban Americans from wiring funds through Western Union.\n\nTrump\u2019s policies won praise from the Cuban American right, but two years into his administration, opinion in South Florida was still divided. A 2018 Florida International University (FIU) poll found the community evenly split on whether to keep the embargo (51 percent in favor, 49 percent against), and large majorities favored maintaining diplomatic relations, food and medicine sales, unrestricted travel, and people-to-people educational exchanges.100 Two years later, however, an FIU poll in the middle of the 2020 presidential campaign revealed a significant shift toward tougher policies. Support for the embargo had jumped to 60 percent. Seventy-two percent favored the policy of maximum pressure to bring about regime change, and 66 percent supported Trump\u2019s handling of the Cuba issue. Fifty-nine percent said they would vote for Trump, compared to just 25 percent for Biden. Among the most important findings was that recent arrivals from Cuba\u2014usually a moderate constituency that wanted to maintain ties with family on the island\u2014were now identifying with Republicans.101\n\nBut it was an Equis Research poll eight months earlier, in November 2019, that shaped Joe Biden\u2019s campaign strategy on Cuba. The poll confirmed a dramatic shift among Cubans who arrived in the United States after the 1994 rafter crisis, a group that had been strong supporters of Obama\u2019s opening. During the Trump administration, this cohort turned against engagement, switching to the Republican Party and Donald Trump. From 2014 to 2019, the Democrats\u2019 share of registered Cuban American voters fell from 30 to 15 percent.102Equis offered several mutually reinforcing explanations for this dramatic shift: Trump\u2019s hard-line policies had re-energized the right; Republican charges that socialist Democrats would destroy America resonated with exiles who had fled socialist regimes; and the \u201cdisinformation-heavy\u201d Spanish-language media bubble in South Florida, especially the rise of social media influencers like Trump cheerleader Alex Otaola, spread outlandish conspiracy theories. Taken together, these developments created a highly partisan pro-Republican milieu into which new arrivals from Cuba (and Venezuela and Nicaragua) were being socialized.103\n\nDespite the daunting polling numbers, Equis recommended that the Biden campaign fight for Cuban American support, arguing, \u201cBiden doesn\u2019t need to win the Cuban vote, but the electoral math requires him to compete for increased support.\u201d That, however, was not the lesson the campaign took from the data.104\n\nThe Biden campaign\u2019s central focus was to rebuild the \u201cblue wall\u201d in the Midwest\u2014\u2013 Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania\u2014that Hillary Clinton lost to Trump in 2016 by a combined total of just 77,744 votes. Florida and North Carolina were also seen as competitive, but the campaign was slow to build its infrastructure in Florida, prompting bitter complaints from organizers on the ground.105Once it got going, the Florida campaign targeted traditional Democratic supporters\u2014seniors, African Americans, and non-Cuban Latinos\u2014to maximize turnout in the midst of COVID. It did not make a major effort to contest Trump\u2019s support among Cuban Americans. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen firsthand that Democrats have abandoned the battlefield,\u201d complained Democratic pollster Fernand Amandi.106\n\nOn the issue of Cuba, Biden faced a dilemma. As Obama\u2019s vice president, he could hardly repudiate one of Obama\u2019s signature diplomatic achievements. But the shift in Cuban American opinion suggested that embracing normalization was no longer good politics. The result was a strategy of \u201cdo no harm.\u201d The campaign tried to say as little as possible about Cuba, convinced that anything Biden said would lose Cuban American votes without gaining any elsewhere. When polling in the months before Election Day found Biden trailing Trump among Cuban Americans by 30 to 40 points, the campaign had even less incentive to invest in chasing their votes.107\n\nWhen Biden had to talk about Cuba, he followed Obama\u2019s 2008 formula of focusing on Cuban American families. \u201cAmericans\u2014and especially Cuban-Americans\u2014can be our best ambassadors for freedom in Cuba,\u201d he said, cribbing a line from Obama\u2019s 2008 speech to the Cuban American National Foundation. \u201cTherefore, as president, I will promptly reverse the failed Trump policies that have inflicted harm on the Cuban people and done nothing to advance democracy and human rights.\u201d108 Asked directly if he would return to Obama\u2019s policy of engagement, he answered, \u201cYes, I would \u2026 in large part.\u201d109When Trump imposed sanctions on remittance service providers in the closing weeks of the campaign, the Biden camp denounced it for \u201cdenying Cuban Americans the right to help their families.\u201d110\n\nTrump\u2019s Florida strategy built on the strategy Ron DeSantis and Rick Scott used in their races for governor and U.S. Senate in 2018, when they accused Democrats of being socialists.111By tying all Democrats to self-avowed Democratic socialists Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Republicans were able to mobilize the Cuban, Venezuela, and Nicaraguan diasporas that had fled socialism in their home countries.\n\nCuba jumped back into the headlines when Biden was selecting his running mate. Among the finalists was Democratic Representative Karen Bass of California, who, as a young woman, had traveled to Cuba several times with the Venceremos Brigade solidarity group. As a member of Congress, she had a long record of supporting engagement with Cuba. Florida Democrats were appalled at the prospect of her on the ticket. \u201cFairly or unfairly, Karen Bass\u2019s history on this subject makes Bernie Sanders look like Ronald Reagan,\u201d said pollster Amandi.112 Biden himself did not regard her history as disqualifying, he told aides, because he believed the election would be won or lost in the Midwest, not Florida.113Even after Biden named Senator Kamala Harris as his running mate, Donald Trump was still using Bass as a foil, tweeting in October, \u201cJoe Biden is a PUPPET of CASTRO-CHAVISTAS like Crazy Bernie, AOC and Castro-lover Karen Bass. \u2026 Biden is weak on socialism.\u201d114\n\nOn Election Day, Biden and the Democrats took a beating among Cuban American voters. Trump won more than 60 percent of their vote in Miami-Dade, and Democrats lost two House seats in South Florida with large Cuban populations (FL 26th and 27th) to Cuban American Republicans. However, Biden\u2019s unerring focus on the Midwest proved to be a winning formula. He carried Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania by a combined total of just 255,425 votes, giving him an Electoral College majority. Trump\u2019s gains among Cuban Americans accounted for only a third of the margin of Biden\u2019s loss in Florida, so while the campaign\u2019s decision not to compete aggressively for their votes ran up Trump\u2019s totals, it made no difference in the statewide outcome.\n\nBiden\u2013Trump, 2024: Promises unkept\n\nJoe Biden did not keep his promise to return to Obama\u2019s policy of engagement. For over a year, he did nothing. Finally, in May 2022, under pressure from Latin American leaders poised to boycott the Summit of the Americas, Biden removed restrictions on family remittances and relaxed some travel regulations, steps Obama had taken during his first weeks in office. In 2023, the consular section of the U.S. Embassy resumed processing immigrant visas. But the looming 2024 campaign caused the administration to renege on a promise to relax regulations to help Cuba\u2019s emerging private sector. Congressional Democrats who supported Obama\u2019s opening began referring to the \u201cTrump\u2013Biden\u201d Cuba policy.115\n\nIn the Republican primary debates, the issue of Cuba did not come up, even during the debate held in Miami. But in a competing rally in Hialeah, where a majority of residents are Cuban Americans, Donald Trump played to the crowd. \u201cWe have some great Cubans here, and nobody ever did more for Americans who love Cuba than a gentleman named Donald J. Trump when he was president,\u201d Trump congratulated himself. He claimed that his \u201ctough sanctions\u201d had Cuba on the cusp of collapse until Biden came in and \u201cblew it.\u201d The Cubans \u201cwere ready to do anything for our Cuban Americans and for me,\u201d he fantasized. \u201cYou were going to be taking it over very quickly.\u201d116\n\nRecent polls have confirmed the continuing shift in Cuban American opinion away from support for engagement with Cuba. A 2022 Florida International University poll showed Democrats in South Florida outnumbered by Republicans two-to-one in party registration. Support for the embargo has rebounded to 63 percent, with recent immigrants almost as strongly in favor as early ones. Cuban Americans overwhelmingly opposed President Biden\u2019s Cuba policy, 72 percent to 28 percent\u2014even though Biden\u2019s policy was only marginally different from Trump\u2019s. Cuban American antipathy toward Democrats reaches across a wide range of policy issues, foreign and domestic.117\n\nIn the White House, political calculations remain unchanged from the 2020 campaign: do nothing on Cuba because anything positive entails political costs with no offsetting gains. Speaking at the U.S. Institute for Peace in September 2022, the NSC adviser on Latin America, Juan Gonzalez, observed that Latin America, more than most regions, involved \u201cvery huge domestic equities. \u2026 It\u2019s hard to take the politics out of some of the considerations when you\u2019re trying to drive policy.\u201d118The chances that Biden would take action to reduce sanctions on Cuba before the 2024 election are nearly nil.\n\nIn the White House, political calculations remain unchanged from the 2020 campaign: do nothing on Cuba because anything positive entails political costs with no offsetting gains.\n\nAnother reason for the campaign\u2019s caution is the Florida Senate race, where Republican Rick Scott is running for reelection. Scott\u2019s low popularity makes him one of the few vulnerable Republican incumbents in 2024, whereas several Democrats are facing tough reelections, putting the party\u2019s Senate majority in jeopardy. If there is even an outside chance that Democrats could pickup a Senate seat in Florida to offset expected losses elsewhere, the Biden campaign will do nothing on Cuba that might complicate that race.\n\nBarring some unforeseen crisis, Cuba itself is not likely to be a major issue in the 2024 campaign. Biden will say as little as he can get away with, and since he has left most of Trump\u2019s sanctions in place, there are few things about his Cuba policy that Republicans can easily attack. Instead, Republicans are certain to reiterate the strategy that was so effective in the 2018, 2020, and 2022 election cycles\u2014the charge that Democrats are socialists bent on destroying America.\n\nA look at the electoral landscape explains why both Democrats and Republicans focus on Florida. Most of the electoral map of the United States is predetermined. In 2020, there were only eight states in which the winner\u2019s margin of victory was less than 5 percentage points: Georgia (0.24 percent), Arizona (0.31 percent), North Carolina (1.35 percent), Nevada (2.39 percent), Florida (3.36 percent), and the Democrats\u2019 \u201cblue wall\u201d of Wisconsin (0.63 percent), Pennsylvania (1.16 percent), and Michigan (2.78 percent). Apart from these battleground states, Democrats begin the race almost assured of 226 of the 270 electoral votes needed to win; Republicans begin with 187. Of the battleground states\u2019 123 electoral votes, Republicans have to win more than two-thirds to put together a majority. Florida\u2019s importance is magnified by its size. If Republicans lose Florida\u2019s 29 electoral votes, they can afford to lose only one other small swing state (Arizona, Nevada, or Wisconsin).\n\nThis electoral math is why Republicans see Florida as a must-win state and why Democrats continue to contest it, even though it is the swing state where Republicans had the largest margin of victory in 2020. Biden\u2019s 2024 campaign indicated it would focus on holding the states they won in 2020 (the blue wall plus Arizona and Georgia), and make a push for Florida and North Carolina.119 A referendum on abortion rights will be on the ballot in Florida in November 2024, which is likely to spur Democratic turnout. \u201cFlorida\u2019s back in play,\u201d Florida Democratic Party Chairwoman Nikki Fried told the Washington Post, and the Biden campaign reacted by promising to invest more resources to contest the state.120This is essentially the same strategy Democrats have followed ever since 1992: put Florida in play to force Republicans to expend time and money there rather than in other swing states.However, the ability of Democrats to actually threaten Republicans in Florida has been declining. Hillary Clinton lost the state to Trump in 2016 by 112,911 votes; Biden lost it by 371,686 votes. In 2022, Governor Ron DeSantis beat Charlie Crist by 1.5 million votes, and Senator Marco Rubio beat Val Demings by 1.3 million. According to exit polls, 67 percent of Cuban Americans voted for Rubio in the 2022 midterm elections, and 69 percent for DeSantis.121\n\nCuban American Republicans\n\nCuba policy used to be decisive in determining how Cuban Americans voted. FIU polls from 1993 to 2016 found big majorities saying it was important, and many of them declaring it very important. But the salience of the issue was lowest among those who had arrived recently or were born in the United States, and highest among the oldest age cohort. That suggests that as the older generation passes from the scene and the proportion of the community born in the United States grows, the salience of Cuba policy for Cuban American voters may gradually decline.\n\nAs the older generation passes from the scene and the proportion of the community born in the United States grows, the salience of Cuba policy for Cuban American voters may gradually decline.\n\nIn 2018, the FIU poll replaced the question about the importance of Cuba policy with one asking respondents to rank the importance of about 10 issues. In three successive polls, Cuba policy ranked far behind healthcare, the economy, and immigration. Except for those over age 76, respondents ranked Cuba policy last or near last in all three polls. No doubt some of the difference between the early and later polls results from the change in question wording, but it does suggest that Democrats could appeal to Cuban Americans on the basis of issues other than Cuba.But as the salience of the Cuba issue declines, Cuban Americans look increasingly like other Republican voters. Even though Trump\u2019s 2020 margin of victory among Cuban Americans was reminiscent of the historic margins Republicans won in the 1990s and early 2000s, Cuban American support over and above the support Republican candidates have received from the general electorate has fallen substantially since 2004 (see table 2). That suggests that a candidate\u2019s stance on Cuba may not make as much of a difference to Cuban American voters as their partisan identification, as Guillermo Grenier has argued.122\n\nThe \u201chistoric exile\u201d was always conservative on foreign policy, especially toward Cuba, and gravitated toward Republican presidential candidates who typically were the most anti-communist. Their belief that President Kennedy doomed the Bay of Pigs invasion by withholding air support made them open to Republican appeals. A 1970 survey found that members of the community preferred the Republican Party to Democrats 73 percent to 16 percent, with many citing the Bay of Pigs as the reason.123\n\nBut the partisan identification of Cuban Americans as Republicans was not foreordained. As their voter registration increased, Republicans and Democrats split the new voters roughly equally into the 1970s, and Democrats could win local contests.124 In 1976, Jimmy Carter narrowly lost the Cuban American vote to Gerald Ford, 48 to 52 percent.125But traditional Democratic constituencies saw the rise of Cuban Americans as a threat to their control of the party and resisted it, whereas Florida Republicans opened their arms to the community, seeing them as a building block for a Republican majority. The Republican Party worked for years to establish itself as the party of Cuban Americans in Florida, while Democrats have generally conceded the field, making little effort to build links in the community.126As a result, Democrats have little prospect in the short term of making major inroads into the increasingly Republican Cuban American community.\n\nDoes Florida Make a Difference?\n\nDespite the intensity with which both parties have focused on Florida for the past 30 years, Florida has rarely been decisive in determining the outcome of U.S. presidential elections. And Cuban Americans have only occasionally been decisive in deciding the outcome in Florida. Prior to 1992, the number of eligible Cuban American voters in Florida was not enough to make a difference in the general election because margins of victory were consistently larger than the Cuban American vote in its entirety. Even as the number of Cuban voters grew during the 1980s, the size of Reagan\u2019s and Bush\u2019s margins of victory were far too big in 1980, 1984, and 1988 for Cuban Americans to have made the difference (see table 3).\n\nDespite the intensity with which both parties have focused on Florida for the past 30 years, Florida has rarely been decisive in determining the outcome of U.S. presidential elections.\n\nThat changed in 1992, when Bill Clinton lost Florida, winning only about 22 percent of the Cuban vote despite his best efforts. He would have carried the state had he won just 37 percent (as he nearly managed to do four years later). Nevertheless, his relative success compared to prior Democratic candidates inaugurated the Democrats\u2019 quadrennial quest to cut into the Republicans\u2019 margin with the Cuban community. Gore\u2019s poor showing among Cuban Americans was decisive both in Florida and in the Electoral College in the dramatic and, for Democrats, traumatic 2000 election. Kerry\u2019s 2004 race with Bush was close enough nationally that Florida once again made the difference in the Electoral College, but Kerry lost Florida by a wide margin.\n\nObama carried Florida in 2008, winning about 38 percent of the Cuban vote, but his margin statewide was large enough that McCain would have needed a Reaganesque vote share of 85 percent among Cuban Americans to have won the state, and he still would have lost nationwide. In his second campaign, Obama did even better against Mitt Romney, splitting the Cuban American vote almost evenly. This time, Obama\u2019s margin statewide was small enough that Romney could have flipped Florida had he won just 6 percent more of the Cuban vote than he did. But he still would have lost the White House.\n\nHillary Clinton took about 47 percent of the Cuban American vote in 2016, which was better than any other Democrat except Obama in 2012, but her losses in white blue-collar counties were so large that she would have needed a record 57 percent of the Cuban vote to win the state. Even that would not have made up for the loss of the Democrats\u2019 \u201cblue wall\u201d in the Midwest. Four years later, Biden lost Florida by such a wide margin that he would have needed 65 percent of the Cuban American vote to carry the state. But, having rebuilt the \u201cblue wall,\u201d he didn\u2019t need Florida.\n\nIn short, although Florida has been regarded as a battleground state since 1992, and both parties have identified Cuban Americans as a key constituency to be courted, the record shows that Cuban Americans in Florida have decided only one presidential election since 1960. In the 16 U.S. elections since Fidel Castro rode into Havana in 1959, Florida\u2019s electoral votes have made the difference only twice\u2014in 2000 and 2004 (see table 4). In all the other elections, either the winner of Florida lost the general election (1960, 1992, 2020), or the electoral count was so lopsided that even if the victor had lost Florida, he would have won the general election anyway. Cuban Americans have arguably been the decisive vote in Florida only in 1992, 2000, and 2012. In short, there has only been one election since 1960 in which Cuban Americans made the difference in Florida and in which Florida decided the election\u20142000, the election that continues to haunt Democratic political operatives with a kind of electoral posttraumatic stress disorder.\n\nConclusion \u2013 What Would a Foreign Policy Toward Cuba Look Like?\n\nAt the outset of the second Clinton administration, his foreign policy team was grappling with how to repair relations with Havana after the shootdown of the Brothers to the Rescue aircraft and the passage of the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act (Helms-Burton). In a meeting of senior National Security Council staff, every idea tabled was met with the objection that Miami would never accept it. Finally, National Security Adviser Sandy Berger interrupted. \u201cLet\u2019s pretend we\u2019re the president\u2019s foreign policy advisers,\u201d he suggested, with a hint of sarcasm.127\n\nA Cuba policy that serves the national interests of the United States rather than the parochial interests of the Cuban American right in Miami, or the political fortunes of would-be presidents, would begin with an acknowledgment that the current policy of hostility is not going to depose the Cuban government\u2014something that ought to be self-evident after 65 years of trying in vain. A realistic foreign policy would instead be based on identifying and building upon areas of common interest, while recognizing and managing areas of disagreement like human rights.\n\nA Cuba policy that serves the national interests of the United States\u2026would begin with an acknowledgment that the current policy of hostility is not going to depose the Cuban government.\n\nIn the field of national security, the United States and Cuba share a common interest in combating transnational crime\u2014narcotics trafficking, human trafficking, money laundering, etc.\u2014and the Cubans have historically proved to be reliable partners. Engagement would also provide Havana an opportunity to avoid dependence on the United States\u2019 global rivals Russia and China, and would give Cuba an incentive to cooperate in the search for peaceful solutions to the conflicts in Venezuela and Nicaragua, as it did successfully in Angola in the 1980s and recently in Colombia.\n\nThe United States and Cuba share common interests on a wide range of other issues as well, transnational problems that near-neighbors can only effectively tackle together\u2014environmental protection, the impacts of climate change, public health, plant and animal safety, aviation and maritime safety, etc. During his last two years in office, President Obama concluded 22 bilateral agreements with Cuba on a range of these issues, but many of them have been moribund since the Trump administration.\n\nLifting the economic embargo, or curtailing its scope as Obama did, would help jump-start the Cuban economy, improve the lives of the Cuban people, stimulate the emergent private sector, and open new trade and investment opportunities to U.S. businesses. It might even create a favorable environment for discussing compensation for nationalized property\u2014discussions that began under Obama but were shuttered by Trump.\n\nFinally, the United States and Cuba have deep cultural ties stretching back more than a century and a half, links that have grown more profound as the Cuban American population has expanded. Despite the difficulties of traveling to Cuba, nearly a million U.S. residents visit annually, many of them to see family. Cultural and educational exchanges are rich, though they, too, must run the gamut of government regulations. Cuban and U.S. professionals in medicine, education, agriculture, environmental science, and many other fields actively collaborate despite embargo restrictions that make it harder than it should be. The interests of both countries would be best served by sweeping away all these impediments to engagement, letting ordinary citizens build the bridges of reconciliation that the two governments have had such a hard time constructing.\n\nIn 2024, a policy like this can seem like a bridge too far. But not so long ago, the United States took the first steps down this path, during the last two years of the Obama presidency. The progress made in just 24 months was substantial, though was not without its setbacks, and the domestic political response was more positive than even the policy\u2019s authors expected. Asked what made Obama\u2019s dramatic break with the past possible after so many decades of hostility, Ben Rhodes, who led the U.S. negotiating team, gave a surprisingly simple answer: leadership and political will.128The normalization of relations with Cuba happened, he said, because it was something the president was determined to do.",

        "text": "Inflation, election lies and racial tension weigh on voters in Georgia swing county: \u2018We all got to eat\u2019\nLess than six months before the US presidential election on 5 November, anxiety over the economy looms large. While official figures show a significant recovery since the pandemic, many Americans aren\u2019t buying it. As election day approaches, the Guardian is dispatching reporters to key swing counties to gauge how they are feeling \u2013 and how they might vote.\n\nRows of pecan and peach trees frame the scenery throughout Peach county, Georgia, a rural area of central Georgia, about 100 miles south of Atlanta. A field of yellow school buses pack a lot on the way into Fort Valley, the county\u2019s seat, where the buses used across the US are manufactured.\n\nPeach county is a swing county in what has emerged as one of the most important swing states in the presidential election. And, according to a March 2024 poll conducted by Emerson College, the economy is the most important issue to Georgia voters. About 32% of those polled said the economy was their top priority, trailed by immigration at 14% and healthcare at 12%.\n\nIn 2020, Joe Biden won the state of Georgia by 0.2 percentage points. Donald Trump won Peach county by just over 500 votes, 51.8% to 47.2%. Emerson\u2019s last poll found 46% of voters in Georgia currently support Trump to 42% supporting Biden, with 12% undecided \u2013 setting the state, and Peach county, on course for another nail-biting election where views on the economy will be key.\n\nFor Victoria Simmons, a retired local newspaper editor who lives in Byron, the economy is a top issue. \u201cPeople can hardly afford to buy groceries and are losing hope,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to be focusing more on our own country rather than sending millions to places like Ukraine.\n\n\u201cIf the election is fair and there is no tampering, I believe we will see a Trump victory,\u201d she said.\n\nLike many in the US, Anna Holloway, a retired professor in Fort Valley, doesn\u2019t seem enamored by either candidate. She identifies as a \u201cclassical liberal\u201d and campaigned and voted for the independent Evan McMullin in 2016, but voted for Biden in 2020 and said she intended to do so again.\n\n\u201cI am opposed to big government but voted for Biden and will do so again just because he\u2019s less likely to fracture our political system than Donald Trump,\u201d she said.\n\nInflation remains a big concern for everyone. LeMario Brown, 38, a former city council member in Fort Valley and local pecan farmer, has seen prices rise first-hand. It costs tens of thousands of dollars and years of work to get a pecan farm into production, not including costly and difficult to obtain insurance to cover any crop losses due to natural disasters.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if we\u2019re Republican or Democrat, we all got to eat,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also knows how important just a few votes in the county can be. He came up short in the 2021 election for mayor of Fort Valley by just 19 votes.\n\nBorn and raised in Fort Valley, Brown explained the transitions in the area he had seen over the years and his hopes for improving the local economy and retaining young people and graduates of the local historically Black university, Fort Valley State University.\n\nBrown has been involved with a local non-profit started in 2018, Peach Concerned Citizens, an organization focused on non-partisan civic engagement efforts including voter registration, increasing voter turnout, increasing US census engagement and responses in Peach county and surrounding counties, and educating voters so they have the necessary information to be able to vote and do so informed of who and what they are voting on.\n\n\u201cMost individuals are standoffish because politics are like religion,\u201d said Brown. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to offend, Democrats or Republicans, but most of the time once you engage a person from a social standpoint, they tell you what the issues are if you\u2019re listening because it\u2019s either they\u2019re going to do what they want to do, or we don\u2019t have enough money to do this, or my light bill or gas is too high, so if you listen you\u2019re going to figure what issues you can actually tackle.\u201d\n\nFor all this talk of crisis and the loss of hope at the top level, Peach county \u2013 like the rest of the US \u2013 appears to be doing well. The unemployment rate in the region is just 3.3%, below the US average of 3.9%. Inflation is also trending below the national average. But those macro trends don\u2019t seem to be cutting through locally where people are still feeling the pinch of price rises on everyday living and interest rates seem stuck at heights unseen in 20 years.\n\nWith the state\u2019s voters splitting evenly between Republicans and Democrats, the candidates are fighting for the 18% of voters Pew Research reported don\u2019t lean either way.\n\n\u201cWe have some independent voters and I\u2019ve heard the stories of: \u2018Well, it\u2019s the lesser of two evils, Biden isn\u2019t doing that, Trump is doing this, Trump is going to do that, Trump isn\u2019t doing that, Biden will do that.\u2019 It\u2019s kind of mixed, but I think it all stems back to economics,\u201d Brown added. \u201cPeople want to be able to pay the light bill, put gas in the car, feed their family, the basic necessities of being a productive citizen in the community.\u201d\n\nBut the economy will not be the only issue on the ballot come November. Georgia was also one of the main states where Trump supporters focused their efforts to try to overturn the 2020 election. And for Tim Waters, the chairman of the Peach County Republicans, the number one issue concerning voters in Peach county in 2024 will be corruption, from the local to the federal level.\n\nThe 2020 election \u201cwas stolen and everybody knows it was stolen\u201d, said Waters. \u201cThey just keep up this lying nonsense.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople are sick and tired of the corruption from the absolute travesty of going after Donald Trump again and again and again. That\u2019s why this cabal is trying to destroy this country. People are waking up to it. They\u2019re sick and tired of it and they want change and they want it now,\u201d said Waters. \u201cThat is absolutely what I\u2019m seeing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re still going to cheat again in the elections,\u201d said Waters. \u201cI do not trust the secretary of state. I don\u2019t trust the attorney general of the state of Georgia, Chris Carr, and I do not trust the governor, Brian Kemp. He\u2019s out there at Davos when he should be here focusing on his constituents.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Stakes \u2014 Presidential Transition Free newsletter We will guide you through the aftermath of the US election and the transition to a Trump presidency Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The county has a population around 28,000, 45% Black and 51% white. Racial and economic demographics largely segregate the county, the Black population centered around the county seat of Fort Valley, with the white, higher-income population predominantly concentrated in the parts of the city of Byron that fall in the county\u2019s north-eastern boundary.\n\nDemocrats have traditionally won Black votes in Georgia by overwhelming margins. Trump has been courting Black voters despite a long record of racist remarks and some recent polls have suggested he is gaining ground with Black voters. Kattie Kendrick, a retiree and CEO of Peach Concerned Citizens, politely noted that Trump\u2019s old remarks could be an issue come November.\n\n\u201cBack when I grew up in the country, all of the children played together. The thing I didn\u2019t like, no disrespect to anyone, but when they turned 16, we had to call them mister and miss, but we were playing together all this time and all of a sudden,\u201d said Kendrick.\n\nShe noted the resurgence of racism and division in politics, such as Trump telling the far-right extremist group Proud Boys to \u201cstand back and stand by\u201d during a 2020 presidential debate.\n\n\u201cI think what happened was it was there all the time, but they pulled the rug back, it became more of an accepted norm and it should never be. I don\u2019t think people should be fake or phoney, but I don\u2019t think we were put here to be mean to each other either,\u201d added Kendrick.\n\nShe founded the non-profit in 2018 after she ran for a seat on the county commission in 2016 and noticed some of the civic engagement and outreach gaps in the region, in Peach county and other nearby counties as well including Crawford, Taylor, Marion and Lee counties.\n\nKendrick cited numerous issues facing the county, from economic inequities in development and resources and the pressing need for medical coverage, doctors and expansion of Medicaid.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of people who only believe they need to vote in a presidential election but the president doesn\u2019t necessarily pave the roads, streets, the utility bills, so we try to get information out to the people where it affects them right now,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Rev Leon Williams, pastor at the Fairview CME church in Fort Valley, knows that inflation has hurt people but he hopes that voters will put the current situation in perspective.\n\n\u201cWe just came through Covid-19 where nobody could work, no products were available, so what do you expect when something like that happens? Prices are going to go up, products will be hard to find, supply will be limited, you expect this, it\u2019s going to take time for us to get over that,\u201d said Williams.\n\nVoters should \u201clisten to the parties and see what they say what they will do\u201d and not all the negative attacks on the opposition, he said.\n\n\u201cOur main focus as I see it is to get the people out to vote, motivate people to get out to vote. That is who is going to win, the people more motivated to vote. The Black community, you don\u2019t need to tell them how to vote, they can listen and see what\u2019s being said,\u201d added Williams.\n\nAs November\u2019s election inches nearer, Williams worries about the already heated political environment and where it will lead. \u201cI don\u2019t like the direction everything is going right now. Of course, we have problems, but we can work them out,\u201d said Williams. \u201cThose who you divide and want to put down, where are you going to put them? We all have to live here, so we need to find some kind of way to get along instead of getting divided.\u201d",

        "text": "Nikki Haley says she\u2019s voting for Trump in November\nCNN \u2014\n\nFormer South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley plans to vote for Donald Trump, she said Wednesday in her first public remarks since exiting the Republican presidential primary more than two months ago.\n\nHaley said Trump \u201chas not been perfect\u201d on policies important to her, including foreign policy, immigration and the economy, but President Joe Biden \u201chas been a catastrophe.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo I will be voting for Trump,\u201d said Haley, who served as US ambassador to the United Nations under the former president.\n\nHaley\u2019s remarks about the 2024 race came during a Q&A session following a speech at the conservative Hudson Institute in Washington, DC, where she now serves as the Walter P. Stern chair.\n\nHaley said she has \u201cno regrets\u201d about her GOP primary bid: \u201cWe left it all on the field.\u201d\n\nShe also thanked the primary voters who have continued to back her even after her departure from the race \u2014 a potential warning sign for Trump. And she reiterated the call she\u2019d made when exiting the race in March for the former president to reach out to those voters.\n\n\u201cTrump would be smart to reach out to the millions of people who voted for me and continue to support me, and not assume that they\u2019re just going to be with him. And I genuinely hope he does that,\u201d Haley said.\n\nEarlier this year, Haley and Trump were engaged in what had become a bitter primary feud. Haley, at one point, questioned the former president\u2019s mental fitness. She told CNN in January that Trump and Biden were \u201cequally bad.\u201d\n\nHer critiques of Trump during the primary grew even sharper after the former president mocked the absence of her deployed husband and called for all of her donors to be \u201cpermanently barred from the MAGA camp.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn that moment, he showed that with that kind of disrespect for the military, he\u2019s not qualified to be the president of the United States, because I don\u2019t trust him to protect them,\u201d Haley said in February.\n\nThen, days before dropping out, she said she no longer believed she was bound by the Republican National Committee pledge to support the party\u2019s eventual presidential nominee.\n\n\u2018Dangerous worldview\u2019\n\nAs she ventured back onto the political stage Wednesday, after two months out of public view, Haley didn\u2019t mention Trump in her Hudson Institute speech \u2014 only addressing the former president when asked about him afterward.\n\n\u201cA dangerous worldview has risen on both sides of the aisle,\u201d she said in her remarks. \u201cOnce again, it threatens our prosperity and security. We need to take this seriously.\u201d\n\nShe offered full support for Israel\u2019s war with Hamas and strongly criticized Biden for placing conditions on military aid to the country.\n\n\u201cBiden thinks he\u2019s stopping a war,\u201d Haley said. \u201cIn fact, he\u2019s dragging out a war, emboldening terrorists and making other wars more likely.\u201d\n\nShe was also critical of her fellow Republicans, urging the party to support military aid for Ukraine and Israel. But she did not criticize GOP members by name and praised House Speaker Mike Johnson for the recent passage of a military aid package.\n\n\u201cSending weapons to Ukraine and Israel isn\u2019t foreign aid,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s an investment in a world in which authoritarian dictators cannot run roughshod over free countries.\u201d\n\nSince leaving the race in March, the former South Carolina governor has spent time reconnecting with her family, aides say, including her husband, Michael, who returned from a yearlong overseas deployment.\n\nYet even in her absence, she\u2019s been winning votes in one Republican primary after another. Her lingering support has exposed a potential challenge Trump faces to unifty the party in suburban areas of swing states \u2013 such as outside Philadelphia, where Haley received nearly 25% of the vote in both Chester and Montgomery counties.\n\nWhile Trump has not extended an olive branch to Haley or her supporters, the Biden campaign has closely studied the Republican primary results, aides say, even in deep-red states such as Indiana, where Haley received about 22% of the vote earlier this month. The Biden campaign has sought to reach Haley\u2019s supporters through television and digital ads in hopes of reminding them of Trump\u2019s insults aimed at their candidate.\n\n\u201cThe campaign has the opportunity to target and engage high-information Republican voters like Nikki Haley supporters or other voters who voted for Donald Trump in \u201920, but voted for Democratic candidates in \u201822 across battleground states,\u201d a top Biden adviser told CNN.\n\nThe Biden campaign argued Wednesday that Haley\u2019s backing of Trump doesn\u2019t change the choice before voters. \u201cNothing has changed for the millions of Republican voters who continue to cast their ballots against Donald Trump in the primaries and care deeply about the future of our democracy, standing strong with our allies against foreign adversaries, and working across the aisle to get things done for the American people \u2013 while also rejecting the chaos, division and violence that Donald Trump embodies,\u201d campaign communications director Michael Tyler said in a statement.\n\n\u201cOnly one candidate shares those values, and only one campaign is working hard every day to earn their support \u2013 and that\u2019s President Biden\u2019s.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an open question how many of those voters backing Haley in primary contests are lodging a temporary protest against Trump or actually open to supporting Biden.\n\nRepublican Rep. Ralph Norman of South Carolina, who endorsed Haley in the primary before switching his support to Trump, said he believes she should be on the GOP ticket.\n\n\u201cFor Nikki Haley, in Indiana, to pull over 20% and not be on the ballot is amazing,\u201d Norman told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s why she would make a great VP candidate. And I made that pitch to President Trump and also to Nikki Haley.\u201d\n\nNorman said that while Haley has not expressed interest in joining Trump\u2019s ticket, he believes she would be interested.\n\n\u201cPolitics is an interesting game. People can forget the past and look forward to the future,\u201d Norman said.\n\nFor his part, Trump has said Haley \u201cis not under consideration\u201d but said he wished her well.\n\nAs other former Republican contenders have fallen in line behind Trump, Haley has intentionally kept her distance \u2013 not hostile, but also not hungry for his adulation.\n\nThe two have not spoken since her concession speech in March.\n\nOne longtime Haley friend told CNN that Trump \u201cknows how to reach her if he wants to make amends and try to start winning over her supporters.\u201d\n\nHaley\u2019s next steps are uncertain. She has neither ruled in \u2013 nor ruled out \u2013 a potential 2028 presidential bid. In her speech Wednesday, she offered few clues, even as she struck an optimistic note to the future.\n\n\u201cWe are blessed to live in America,\u201d Haley said. \u201cAnd as every generation of Americans proves, we always rally to defend that blessing.\u201d\n\nThis story and headline have been updated.\n\nCNN\u2019s Kit Maher contributed to this report.",

        "text": "Opinion: We Germans are making Trump \u2018thunderstorm\u2019 plans\nCourtesy CNN/Thomas Ernst\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: Anna Sauerbrey is the foreign editor at German newspaper Die Zeit. The views expressed in this commentary are her own.\n\nBerlin CNN \u2014\n\nIt\u2019s 9.00 a.m. on a Sunday morning in early Spring, and we are waiting for the kids to come out onto the soccer field. Some of us are holding coffee cups. We have all gotten up early to take our fourth and fifth graders to this south-eastern district of Berlin, where they will be playing the K\u00f6penicker FC in just a bit.\n\nThe conversation revolves around school and recent vacations, as I ask my fellow soccer moms and dads about the US election, explaining that I am working on a piece for CNN opinion. Do they follow US politics? And what do they think about it?\n\n2024: the view from afar Each month leading up to the US election, a CNN Opinion writer in a different country explores how locals view America and why the choice of the next president matters to them.\n\nRead also: \u2018The view from Taiwan: I\u2019d rather raise my child here than America.\u2019\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very worried,\u201d says J\u00f6rg, who has been with our club forever and whose 18-year-old son Miguel is our kid\u2019s coach. J\u00f6rg works service shifts for a local train company and whenever his hours allow, he tells me, he watches the late-night political talk shows which frequently discuss the possibility of a second Donald Trump presidency.\n\n\u201cTo me,\u201d he goes on, \u201cTrump seems like the leader of a sect. His supporters would follow him whatever he does. That\u2019s scary.\u201d If Trump is elected, J\u00f6rg is convinced, he would withdraw American troops from Europe and stop aid to Ukraine.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m scared, too,\u201d says Eda, who teaches politics at a Berlin middle school, and Piero agrees. Piero is an urban researcher and lecturer from Italy and has been living in Berlin for many years now. Both Piero and Eda follow US news closely, like J\u00f6rg.\n\nPiero says many things about this election remain incomprehensible to him. He is startled by the Biden-Trump rematch. \u201cThe Democrats have failed to build a successor when there was still time,\u201d he says. \u201cThat I just don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\nIn the four years since Joe Biden and Donald Trump last went head-to-head in a presidential debate - pictured here in October, 2020 - Germans have been reassessing their dependence on the US. Jim Bourg/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSix months ahead of the vote, this soccer field conversation reflects the German view of the US elections quite well. Conversations do not necessarily circle around it naturally outside the Berlin politics bubble. After all, there are enough things to worry about: the war in Gaza, the war in Ukraine, finding a plumber in an economy increasingly marked by labor shortage and making ends meet after a period of high inflation.\n\nBut when I ask about it, I often find that American politics is there at the back of people\u2019s minds. The election is like a thunderstorm in the distance that might or might not come down on us, and many people monitor its path.\n\nThe war on Europe\u2019s doorstep\n\nUS elections have always been intensely reported on in Germany, but this time, there\u2019s an added sense of tension. Since Russia began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Germany and Europe\u2019s long-time security dependence on the United States is at the heart of the political debate.\n\nEuropean countries have started to step up. Germany has increased its defense spending, is building its defense industry and has spent billions on military and financial aid to Ukraine.\n\nStill, without US support, Ukraine\u2019s situation \u2013 and therefore, Europe\u2019s \u2013 would be dire. The US is both our lifeline and a vulnerability. And people sense it.\n\nAt a campaign rally earlier this year, Donald Trump recalled how he once told a European leader he would \u201cencourage\u201d Russia \u201cto do whatever the hell they want\u201d to any NATO member country that didn\u2019t pay their \u201cbills\u201d - meaning, if they didn\u2019t live up to their NATO spending pledges.\n\nDespite the obvious, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has recently taken to publicly playing down the importance of the US elections to Germany and Europe. Asked about the future of NATO if Trump wins, at a press conference in late April, he said he was \u201cfairly confident\u201d that NATO would remain stable \u201cin the next decades.\u201d\n\nRussia's war in Ukraine has forced German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to upturn the country's decadeslong military-light foreign policy. But he has also faced criticism for the slow pace of weapons delivered to Ukraine. Michael Kappeler/picture alliance/Getty Images\n\n\u201cThere will be new presidents all the time,\u201d Scholz said casually, referring to the United States.\n\nIt was a rather obvious attempt to soothe the worries of German citizens such as my fellow soccer mums and dads, but if you ask me, it\u2019s futile. I also find it unlikely that the Chancellor\u2019s exaggerated composure reflects his true thinking.\n\nWhen I speak to officials within the German administration, I pick up a rather different mood. Many are busy bracing for the known \u2013 and unknown.\n\nBracing for the Trump thunderstorm\n\nIt\u2019s a Monday night, in an office somewhere in a vast labyrinth of uniform corridors in a large government building in Berlin. A somewhat tired looking senior government official sits down in an armchair to discuss how Germany is preparing for the outcome of the US elections, for both possible outcomes, as he stresses several times. He asks not to be named, to discuss sensitive matters.\n\nFirst, he says, there are efforts to try to get to know and build relations with people close to Trump, Republican senators, representatives and governors. In September last year, Germany\u2019s foreign minister Annalena Baerbock herself went on a long tour, touching down, amongst other places, in Texas, where she met with Governor Greg Abbott. Many other German diplomats and officials are touring the US, too, particularly the south and center, to connect.\n\nSecond, he says, the administration is trying to build awareness in Germany\u2019s business world that things might get rough, especially in case Trump wins. German US-watchers and diplomats widely expect Trump would slap new tariffs on European goods imported to the US and think he might try to force European companies to cooperate more closely with the US on containing China. But even during a second Biden administration, things might get tougher, the official says. He also expects Congress to stay volatile even if Biden wins.\n\nThird, Germany is raising the question of what happens if Trump is elected, in meetings with its close European allies, such as Poland and France, the official says. \u201cIf Donald Trump is reelected, we have to try to stick together in the European Union, and Poland, France and Germany would have to lead the way,\u201d he says. If Europe manages to \u201cstick together,\u201d its chances to extract concessions from Trump might be better than many doomsday analysts currently think, he adds. After all, the US depends on the European market, too.\n\nEuropean Union flags fly in front of the European Central Bank in Frankfurt, earlier this year. While EU leaders agree that more money should go to arming Ukraine, there have been divisions over how to finance it. Kirill Kudryavtsev/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIt\u2019s an optimistic view, based on the assumption that Trump will act rationally, as a deal-maker, if elected. But what if this assumption is wrong? What if Trump tries to take America out of NATO or creates a \u201cdormant NATO,\u201d a NATO existent only in name?\n\nEven if Biden is re-elected, or Trump proves to be more rational than feared, America\u2019s democratic backsliding in the past decade has already deeply impacted how German society views America - and will likely continue to do so, no matter what the outcome of the elections is.\n\nThe American dream no more\n\nBack on the soccer field, my conversation with Eda turns to sports. Eda is wearing a Dallas Mavericks shirt. Later that day, the Mavericks will play the LA Clippers, and Eda is a huge NBA fan. She has never been to the US but says she has vowed to go if the Mavericks ever get to the finals, no matter how expensive the tickets.\n\nLike many in our generation \u2013 on the cusp of Generation X and Millennial - Eda and I are very much into American culture. Through all the ups and downs in US-German political relations, we agree, America has stayed a big dream.\n\nWe were politically socialized during George H. Bush\u2019s presidency, in fact the first time I ever went to a demonstration as a girl was to protest the first Gulf war.\n\nBut we also remember the euphoria when America elected Barack Obama to be its first Black president. Obama was venerated like a star in Germany, and many of the other parents on the soccer field remember vividly when he came to Berlin in 2008, how traffic came to a standstill because 200,000 flocked to the Siegess\u00e4ule, the Victory Column, to see him.\n\nThen-US President Barack Obama is given a rock star welcome on his visit to Berlin in 2008. Heinz M. Jurisch/ullstein bild/Getty Images\n\nUS-German relations have never been just about trade, military cooperation, or the nuclear umbrella. It is also America\u2019s soft power, its cultural-political allure, that has brought generations of Germans to view it as natural partner.\n\nEurope\u2019s hard right is watching America closely\n\nIn the past decade, however, that sentiment has shifted. For many younger generation Germans, America has become something of a dark force that fuels anti-democratic movements, rather than the light that emanates from the beacon of freedom.\n\nOn a Friday afternoon, Schahina Gambir gives me a call. She is a representative for the Green party at the Bundestag. Gambir was born in Kabul in 1991 and has grown up in a rural area in northern Germany. She is a member of the committee for foreign affairs but also works on human rights issues.\n\nThe US elections, she says, will of course have an impact on Europe\u2019s security. But they will also be felt in German society. \u201cDebates in the US resonate here and could shift Europe further to the right,\u201d she says. \u201cRight-wing networks in Europe have connections to right-wing networks in the US. US conspiracy theories spread here and have fueled, for example, the anti-vaxxer-scene here in Germany.\u201d\n\nAs a young woman, she says, she is also worried the US debate on abortion rights could influence Europe. \u201cThe United States were one of the first countries to legalize abortion in 1973, they were a model for others. Now, they are moving backwards,\u201d she says of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade.\n\nDemonstrators gather against state abortion regulations in New York City, in May 1972. There are fears in Germany that the overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022 could inspire similar moves in Europe. Bob Parent/Getty Images\n\n\u201cI am worried that the rights we have thought of as established, as a given, might be questioned, here, too, like they are in the United States,\u201d says Gambir. Not just abortion rights, she adds, but also the rights of queer communities and people of color.\n\nAs a 32-year-old, Gambir does remember the Obama years. She has travelled to the US, her sister lives in New York and loves it. Many of today\u2019s German teenagers and college students, however, only know the US as Trump country, a once great democracy on a slippery slope. Another Trump presidency would not only put Germany\u2019s security at risk, but also manifest this view of the US for another four years.\n\nOn the soccer field that day, our kids easily win their game. Eda and her son leave rather content. Later, she sends me a message: The Dallas Mavericks have lost. She adds a crying emoji.",

        "text": "Biden, Trump rematch: Here's how the presidential election may disrupt the stock market\nJoe Biden and Donald Trump 2024 Brendan Smialowski | Jon Cherry | Getty Images\n\nThe stock market has yet to price in a potential outcome in the presidential election, a rematch between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump. In general, election years are not great for the stock market leading up to voting day, David Woo, CEO of research firm Unbound, said Wednesday in a session during CNBC's Financial Advisor Summit. But this year is an exception, Woo explained. \"This year we're up 12% so far. This is the best-performing year for the S&P 500 [in] an election year since [the] 1980 election,\" Woo said. Looking back to 1928, the S&P 500 returned an average 7.5% in presidential election years, versus an average 8% in non-election years, according to a March analysis from J.P. Morgan Private Bank. \"Given this is going down in history as probably the most consequential and contentious election in the U.S. in 100 years, it's kind of difficult to believe that the market is trading with the election in mind,\" Woo said.\n\nWhat Biden, Trump could mean for the stock market\n\nWhile domestic issues are usually determinative in presidential elections, the coming race will likely be focused on international issues, said Woo. Both candidates will enter office with a budget deficit of $1 trillion, meaning \"whoever is going to be the next president is going to be facing a real serious constraint,\" said Woo. \"When it comes to fiscal policy, frankly speaking, I don't think there will be a huge difference.\"\n\nInstead, the differentiator will depend on the candidate's stance on foreign policy, he said. Defense spending might increase under a Biden administration, signaling a potential boost for defense stocks, Woo said. Meanwhile, emerging markets \"may be more bullish\" under a Trump administration, he said. \"I think Trump is going to come back with a more transactional approach in dealing with American adversaries,\" said Woo, who believes the Republican candidate us going to revisit the Phase 1 Trade agreement between China and Russia as the \"starting point\" of any negotiation deal between the U.S. and China. Elsewhere, energy stocks might benefit under Biden more so than Trump. \"Everybody thinks Donald Trump is going to be bullish for energy ... that's completely untrue,\" Woo said. \"It was actually not until Biden became president and energy stocks soared because geopolitical risks went through the roof,\" he said. Meanwhile, all polls are pointing toward a Trump reelection, Steve Kornacki, National Political Correspondent at NBC News and MSNBC, said during the summit. \"Donald Trump in the average is leading Biden by 1.1 points nationally,\" he said, as Trump has made gains among Hispanic and African American voters, as well as younger, nonwhite voters. \"That accounts for why Donald Trump is polling better now than he did four years ago,\" he said.\n\nWhen the market gets volatile during elections\n\nHistorically, potential election outcomes have a minimal impact on financial market performance in the medium and long term, according to an analysis by investment strategists at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. They studied market data from the past 75 years and identified patterns that repeated themselves during election cycles. Yet delays in verifying an election winner have negatively affected riskier asset classes in prior races, according to the analysis. \"The stock market does not like uncertainty whatsoever,\" said Douglas A. Boneparth, a certified financial planner, president and founder of Bone Fide Wealth, a wealth management firm based in New York City.\n\nIf things are delayed and there's not a \"clear-cut winner,\" that uncertainty can lead to market volatility, he said. \"But it's very hard to predict what the market is going to do based on simply who's going to get elected.\" Overall, the stock market has done well under both presidents, said Boneparth: \"No one's crying over how well the market has done in either administration.\"\n\n'You're probably going to make a mistake'",

Notably, billionaire Elon Musk is fan of the latter two coins, traded on markets as DOGE and SHIB.\n\nIts not yet clear if the Trump campaign will retain the cryptocurrency or sell it immediately, as well as what fees might be incurred during liquidation. Although the campaign intends to comply with US election laws, the anonymous nature of cryptocurrencies can complicate the verification of the source of the funds.\n\nThe former US President has already received millions in cryptocurrency personally through his Trump Digital Trading Cards non-fungible token projects and his MAGA coin released last August, as per AP reports.\n\n\u201cCrypto is nonpartisan and moves money forward because its cheaper and faster. The Coinbase platform is open to all candidates this election season,\u201d Coinbase spokeswoman Julia Krieger told The Associated Press.\n\nThe presidential campaign for independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is also accepting bitcoin donations, while Joe Biden's campaign team did not respond to AP's queries whether it is also welcoming contributions through cryptocurrency.\n\nWhile some states prohibit cryptocurrency donations in state elections under current campaign finance laws, the Federal Election Commission permits committees to accept bitcoin as contributions.\n\nA 2014 advisory opinion from the commission determined that bitcoin qualifies as \"money or anything of value\" under the law. Political committees are advised to value bitcoin contributions based on its market value at the time the contribution is received.",

        "text": "Scenes From a MAGA Meltdown: Inside the \u201cAmerica First\u201d Movement\u2019s War Over Democracy\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they\u2019re published.\n\nStanding in a cafe decorated with tiny American flags and antique cabinets as big as bodyguards, Peter Meijer paused as he considered what to say to the man in the \u201cStand for God\u201d shirt who had just called for his bodily harm.\n\nIt was a snowy morning in February. Meijer was the keynote speaker at a coffee-and-donuts meeting hosted by the Republican Party chapter in Kent County, Michigan, the most populous county on the west side of the state. Dressed in a candidate-casual uniform of jeans, a flannel shirt and an outdoorsy blazer, Meijer was seeking the Republican nomination for an open U.S. Senate seat, a race that could determine control of Congress\u2019s upper chamber, in a state that could decide the presidential election. If Republicans wanted to win in November, Meijer told the 40-odd people in attendance, they needed to move on from the past and focus on their shared enemy.\n\n\u201cIs there anyone who thought that Jan. 6th was good for the Republican Party?\u201d he asked. \u201cDid it help us win in 2022?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t gonna win,\u201d someone yelled. \u201cIt was rigged.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe election was stolen,\u201d another person said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nI watched this exchange from a table near the back of the room. Until that moment, the crowd met Meijer\u2019s stump speech with polite nods and gentle applause. But when he brought up elections and Jan. 6th, the mood turned from Midwest nice to hostile.\n\nNot long ago, this setting was friendly terrain for Meijer. For decades, voters here rewarded sensible, pro-business, avowedly conservative politicians. Meijer fit the archetype of a West Michigan Republican when he first ran for Congress in 2020. He was also basically Michigan royalty as an heir to the Meijer grocery store fortune. In one of the state\u2019s most competitive districts, he won his debut congressional race by a comfortable 6-point margin.\n\nAt the Kent County event, however, many attendees seemed to feel nothing but scorn for him. That anger flowed from a single decision Meijer had made in Congress: He voted to impeach then-President Donald Trump. In response, he faced a far-right primary challenger who had served in the Trump administration and said Biden\u2019s 2020 victory was \u201csimply mathematically impossible.\u201d Meijer narrowly lost. Now, as a Senate candidate, he was trying to make amends, even pledging to vote for Trump \u2014 whom he had once called \u201cunfit for office\u201d \u2014 if the former president won the Republican nomination. But to some, he was still a traitor.\n\n\u201cHow did you vote to impeach Trump when he said in his [Jan. 6] speech, \u2018I want a peaceful demonstration,\u2019\u201d a man angrily asked. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to go any further than that to know that he was right and that he shouldn\u2019t have been impeached.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was there,\u201d another man called out. \u201cWe were peaceful.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo shouting now,\u201d the emcee said.\n\nThen-Rep. Peter Meijer, a Republican, voted in 2021 to impeach President Donald Trump. Credit: Kent Nishimura/Los Angeles Times/Getty Images\n\nOne audience member accused Meijer of taking a bribe in exchange for his impeachment vote.\n\nAnother challenged him to name five \u201cpolitical prisoners from Jan. 6\u201d who were \u201csitting in prison and falsely accused.\u201d I watched Meijer struggle to complete a sentence before being cut off.\n\nA third person pointed a finger at him as he questioned whether Meijer was actually in the Capitol complex on Jan. 6, 2021, as he\u2019d claimed.\n\n\u201cI have a photo I took in the House,\u201d Meijer said, trying to defend himself without sounding defensive. Mostly, he listened wide-eyed, sipping coffee from a Styrofoam cup.\n\nAn older woman asked, in a gentler tone, if Meijer would redo his impeachment vote if he could. Would he at least have abstained instead of voting \u201cyes\u201d?\n\nMeijer responded by saying that when he was in Congress, someone had once joked that they\u2019d throw him off a bridge if he ever voted \u201cpresent.\u201d\n\nA deep voice rang out on the far side of the room. The man in the \u201cStand for God\u201d shirt.\n\n\u201cSorry?\u201d Meijer said, not hearing him.\n\nThe man repeated himself: \u201cYou should\u2019ve gotten thrown off the bridge.\u201d\n\nA crowd gathers outside the Capitol at a pro-Trump protest on Jan. 6, 2021.

The most important fault line in the party now is democracy itself. Today\u2019s Republican insurgents believe democracy has been stolen, and they don\u2019t trust the ability of democratic processes to restore it.\n\nThis phenomenon is evident across the country, in Georgia and Nevada, in Arizona, Idaho and Florida. But it\u2019s perhaps the starkest in Michigan, a place long associated with political pragmatism and a business-friendly GOP, embodied by governors George Romney, John Engler and, most recently, Rick Snyder. It was a son of Michigan, former President Gerald Ford, who once said, \u201cI have never mistaken moderation for weakness, nor civility for surrender.\u201d\n\nI grew up in Michigan. My own political education and my early years as a journalist coincided with a stunning Republican resurgence in my home state. Over several decades, Michigan\u2019s dynastic families \u2014 the DeVoses and Meijers and Van Andels on the west side, the Romneys and Fords on the east \u2014 poured money and manpower into the Michigan Republican Party, building it into one of the most vaunted political operations in the country. They transformed Michigan from a bastion of organized labor that leaned Democratic into a toss-up state that, until recently, had a right-to-work law and put Republicans in control of all three branches of government for eight of the last 14 years. Michigan Republicans were so successful that other states copied their tactics. As Dick DeVos, heir to the Amway fortune and a prolific Republican donor, once told a gathering of conservative activists, \u201cIf we can do it in Michigan, you can do it anywhere.\u201d\n\nProPublica Get Our Top Investigations Subscribe to the Big Story newsletter.

I watched as thousands of political newcomers, whose sole qualification appeared to be fervor of belief, declared war on the Republican establishment that had been so dominant. Calling themselves the \u201cAmerica First\u201d movement, these unknowns treated the DeVoses and other party leaders as the enemy. I had covered the DeVoses and the Michigan Republican Party long enough to know that they were not just pro-business but staunch conservatives who wanted to slash taxes, abolish regulations and remake the public education system in favor of vouchers and parochial schools. Yet the new \u201cAmerica First\u201d activists disparaged prominent Michigan Republicans as \u201cglobalist\u201d elites who belonged to a corrupt \u201cuniparty\u201d cabal. That cabal had denied Trump a rightful second term and needed to be purged from the party.\n\nWith a consequential election looming, I traveled back to Michigan earlier this year to understand how this all happened. I sought out the activists waging this struggle, a group of people who don\u2019t trust institutions or individuals except Trump and one another \u2014 and sometimes not even that. Could they triumph over the elites? I found chaos, incompetence, strife, a glimpse of a future post-Trump Republican Party and, all around me, danger for our system of government and the state of the country.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t keep going through election after election like this where a large plurality of the country just does not accept the outcome of the majority and refuses to abide by it,\u201d said Jeff Timmer, a former executive director of the Michigan Republican Party who now works with the anti-Trump Lincoln Project. \u201cThat\u2019s when the system falls apart.\u201d\n\nTrump at a 2024 rally in Waterford Township, Michigan Credit: Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nA Call From God\n\nAfter Peter Meijer\u2019s event in Kent County, I drove west toward Lake Michigan to meet a plumber named Ken Beyer for lunch. Barrel-chested and with a neatly trimmed goatee, Beyer is in his late 50s but looks younger. He\u2019s disarmingly earnest, the kind of guy who\u2019d offer to help you fix a flat tire in a snowstorm. In less than two years, Beyer had risen from a political nobody to a district chair in the state GOP and a leader of the \u201cAmerica First\u201d movement in Michigan. He is known for his fiery videos, in which he might equate a rival to Adolf Hitler or warn that \u201cthe storm is upon us.\u201d Like many of his \u201cAmerica First\u201d allies, he questions whether democracy still exists in this country. \u201cI don\u2019t know if any election is fair anymore,\u201d he said.\n\nOver chicken tenders and iced tea, Beyer, a church-going Christian, told me about a series of what he saw as divine revelations that had delivered him to this point. The pandemic and 2020 election had shaken him. He no longer recognized his own country. He feared that the moment had come, he said, \u201cwhere freedom and the American dream end.\u201d\n\nKen Beyer, a Republican district chair, feels he is on a divine mission. Credit: Nick Hagen for ProPublica\n\nHis next revelation happened on Jan. 6, 2021. Because he was convinced that Democrats stole the White House from Trump, he had gone to Washington to make his voice heard and show support for the president. Standing on the steps of the Capitol, he encountered a reporter with the conservative outlet Newsmax who needed help carrying gear. Beyer grabbed a tripod and backpack and filled in as a makeshift field producer for one of the biggest events of the 21st century. \u201cWhat God wanted me to do,\u201d he later said, \u201cwas help capture the history of what\u2019s happening and get the truth out of what really was going on there.\u201d\n\nBack in Michigan, Beyer enlisted the help of a young videographer who had produced content for Beyer\u2019s plumbing business, and together they churned out videos about COVID-19 (overblown), election fraud (rampant) and the \u201ctruth\u201d of Jan. 6 (\u201ca big prayer meeting\u201d). He read about disturbing allegations about voting-machine software changing votes. He listened to poll workers allege that mysterious suitcases of mail-in ballots had arrived overnight at the state\u2019s largest ballot-processing site in downtown Detroit (a claim that was later debunked). The more he heard, the more he came to believe that his home state had been central to the Democrats\u2019 plan to steal the 2020 election.\n\nIn his free time, Beyer urged Republican lawmakers to investigate the allegations of fraud made by Trump and his allies. Most Republicans brushed him off. A few, like Peter Meijer, had openly turned on Trump, voting for impeachment or dismissing Trump\u2019s stolen-election theories. Beyer couldn\u2019t understand it. \u201cWhy weren\u2019t they fighting for him?\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to more experienced people in the party, there was a simple answer: Many of the claims brought forward weren\u2019t true. A long-awaited investigation by a Republican-led state Senate committee found \u201cno evidence of widespread or systematic fraud\u201d in Michigan.\n\nIf Republicans wouldn\u2019t act, Beyer reasoned, then they were just as bad as the Democrats. Trump supporters in other states had also encountered Republican indifference in response to Trump\u2019s fraud allegations. What were they supposed to do now?\n\nRepublican Party delegates listen to a speaker at a state GOP convention. Credit: Nick Hagen for ProPublica\n\nThe Re-Founding Fathers\n\nA solution arrived in the form of the \u201cprecinct strategy.\u201d It was a plan promoted by former Trump adviser Steve Bannon to ensure that the political establishment in both parties didn\u2019t \u201csteal\u201d future elections. Precincts are the smallest geographical unit in American elections. In Michigan, there are roughly 4,700 precincts typically made up of a few thousand active registered voters. Each precinct elects at least one delegate as its representative to a county convention, and sometimes three or four. In all, there are upwards of 8,000 delegate positions in Michigan.\n\nIf a state political party is a pyramid with a chairperson at the top, precinct delegates occupy the lowest, broadest tier. Until recently, it was an obscure position. Thousands of the seats often sit empty. If enough Trump supporters filled them, Bannon said, they could form a majority within the party, elect allies to leadership positions and, eventually, take control.\n\nKen Beyer had never heard of a precinct delegate until he stumbled across the website for MI Precinct First, a group inspired by Bannon\u2019s plan. He decided to run. He believed that this, too, must be part of God\u2019s plan for him. \u201cI believe that He\u2019s using people like me throughout the United States to become the re-founding fathers,\u201d he told me.\n\nThe precinct strategy proved successful. In Michigan, thousands of new activists, many recruited by \u201cAmerica First\u201d groups, became precinct delegates in 2022. In Ottawa County, a deeply conservative enclave along Lake Michigan, the number of delegates leapt from 170 to 330. The same trend played out in other battleground states. \u201cThe Trump apparatus did very little correct except infiltrate the party right down to the precinct level,\u201d said Timmer, the former executive director of the Michigan Republican Party. \u201cNot just in Michigan but all over.\u201d\n\nThe first test for the new \u201cAmerica First\u201d delegates came in late August 2022. In Michigan, the voters select most nominees for elected office in a normal primary election. But for two key positions with oversight of elections \u2014 attorney general and secretary of state \u2014 the precinct delegates decide the party\u2019s nominees at a statewide convention. These conventions were often sleepy affairs, the outcome predetermined. But this time, when the party\u2019s chair, a wealthy donor and former U.S. ambassador named Ron Weiser, took the stage, the cavernous ballroom filled with boos and jeers.\n\n\u201cHow many of you believe we can sweep in November?\u201d Weiser asked.\n\n\u201cWith the new people!\u201d a woman wearing a \u201cKeep America Great\u201d hat yelled. \u201cWith \u2018America First\u2019!\u201d\n\nOver the opposition of Weiser and other longtime party operatives, the \u201cAmerica First\u201d contingent nominated two election deniers for attorney general and secretary of state. Matthew DePerno, a combative lawyer who had promoted a viral yet baseless theory about voting fraud in tiny Antrim County, Michigan, vowed to use the power of the attorney general\u2019s office to investigate election crimes. Kristina Karamo, a tall, commanding woman in her late 30s with a breathless speaking style, was the \u201cAmerica First\u201d pick for secretary of state. A community college instructor and live-trivia host, Karamo had come to prominence after she testified before the Michigan Legislature about irregularities involving ballot counting and voting machines she said she\u2019d witnessed as a poll challenger in Detroit in 2020.\n\nThe party convention nominated Kristina Karamo, who has argued that the 2020 election was illegitimate, to be the GOP secretary of state candidate in 2022. Credit: Nic Antaya/The Washington Post/Getty Images\n\nAs a show of political force, nominating DePerno and Karamo was impressive. As an electoral strategy, it was disastrous. Both candidates were trounced in November, and Michigan Democrats won control of all three branches of government for the first time in more than 30 years.\n\nDePerno conceded defeat right away. Karamo did not. To outside observers, her stance was laughable: She had lost by 615,000 votes, roughly the population of Detroit. But Beyer and many other \u201cAmerica First\u201d delegates saw Karamo\u2019s actions as brave and principled, the opposite of DePerno\u2019s cowardly and hypocritical concession. Several months later, she and DePerno ran against each other to be the next chair of the Michigan Republican Party. DePerno won endorsements from Trump and Mike Lindell, the MyPillow CEO and a funder of the election-fraud movement. But the delegates rallied behind Karamo and delivered her the victory. In just two years, Bannon\u2019s precinct strategy had gone from a quixotic scheme to a reality.\n\nNo sooner had Karamo won than paranoia set in. Standing on the convention floor just before her victory, a well-connected precinct delegate approached Beyer to deliver a message. \u201cHe says, \u2018Leadership is going to let you guys have this one,\u2019\u201d Beyer recalled. Karamo would be chair, in other words, because party leaders let it happen. Why\u2019d they do that, Beyer asked. \u201cBecause they believe that they can make her fail quicker than they can Matt DePerno.\u201d\n\nFile Number One\n\nA state political party is like the HVAC unit of American politics. When it does its job, you don\u2019t think about it. It hums away in the background, as unsexy as it is essential. State parties recruit candidates to run for office. They mobilize voters. They raise money that helps candidates spread their message and win elections.\n\nKaramo had other priorities when she took over the Michigan Republican Party. Top of the list: \u201celection integrity.\u201d She created a new \u201celection security operations\u201d team to recruit hundreds of volunteers as poll challengers, dropbox monitors and recount specialists, and to serve on county canvassing boards, which certify the final vote count. To oversee this work, she enlisted grassroots activists best known for filing a lawsuit that accused Detroit\u2019s election clerk of running an \u201cillegal election\u201d in 2022. (A judge dismissed the case, calling it \u201cfrivolous\u201d and \u201crife with speculation.\u201d) Training and embedding \u201cAmerica First\u201d activists in every part of the election process was critical to the future of the party and the state. \u201cOtherwise,\u201d one of Karamo\u2019s advisers told a group of activists, \u201cthe big money is going to come right back in and start doing all this for us and selecting all the candidates for us again.\u201d\n\nKaramo\u2019s plan to \u201csecure\u201d elections had two objectives: Not only did she and her team hope to catch future cheating by the Democrats, but they sought revenge against the Republican establishment. To do that, Karamo turned to a lawyer and political outsider named James Copas. He was given a special project: write a new constitution for the state Republican Party that would give as much power as possible to precinct delegates. People like Ken Beyer.\n\nThere was no greater priority for Karamo\u2019s team. \u201cIf you were to look in my records, I opened 82 different project files,\u201d Copas told me. \u201cThe constitution was file number one.\u201d\n\nKaramo showed little interest in the day-to-day work of running the party. Bills went unpaid, emails unanswered. When members of the party\u2019s state committee, in effect the board of directors, questioned her, she ignored them or removed them from leadership positions. Even her allies were critical. \u201cI can tell you unequivocally that there was no chance that Kristina was qualified to be the chair,\u201d Copas said. \u201cSo what? She was elected.\u201d (Karamo did not respond to multiple requests for comment.)\n\nNear the end of 2023, Copas circulated a draft of his proposed overhaul of the party constitution. The new constitution proposed a radical change: Eliminate open primary elections and replace them with closed caucuses. Under the current system, about a million people voted in an August GOP primary to choose nominees for local elected offices, state legislative seats, judgeships and federal House and Senate races. Instead of those million or so voters casting ballots, fewer than 10,000 precinct delegates \u2014 the same precinct delegates who had powered Karamo to victory \u2014 would meet behind closed doors and select the candidates.\n\nThe aim of this proposal, said Joel Studebaker, who was Karamo\u2019s chief of staff, was to break up the \u201ccorruption club\u201d that had ruled Michigan Republican politics for far too long. \u201cWe want something that\u2019s pure,\u201d he told me. \u201cThe best answer for that is putting power in the hands of the people.\u201d The irony, critics pointed out, was that Karamo\u2019s proposal would disenfranchise far more people than it empowered.\n\nA portion of the preamble and introduction of a proposed new version of the Michigan Republican Party\u2019s constitution Credit: Obtained by ProPublica\n\nThere was another reason the closed-caucus model appealed to the \u201cAmerica First\u201d faithful: It meant there was no need for voting machines, mail-in ballots, high-speed scanners or any of the other technologies that election-fraud believers had spent the last two years railing against. \u201cYou\u2019re eliminating cheating in the election system,\u201d Beyer told me.\n\nThe backlash was fierce. \u201cNothing says \u2018we respect democracy\u2019 like cutting out millions of Michigan voters,\u201d wrote one prominent Michigan conservative activist.\n\nKaramo\u2019s proposed voting reforms and the party\u2019s dire finances plunged the organization into turmoil with the 2024 elections less than a year away. Even some of Karamo\u2019s own supporters turned against her. Privately, a group of delegates discussed whether to urge her to step down for the good of the party. Karamo had no plans to resign. If her enemies wanted her gone, they would have to try to remove her.\n\nAnd so they did: On Jan. 6, 2024, a group of anti-Karamo delegates on the Republican state committee invoked party bylaws and voted to remove Karamo as chair. Two weeks later, the same faction elected former U.S. representative Pete Hoekstra to replace her.\n\nFormer U.S. Rep.

Credit: Nick Hagen for ProPublica\n\nUp From the Ashes\n\nBy the time Trump walked onstage in Waterford Township, Michigan, in mid-February with his red hat pulled low, the Michigan Republican Party was a national punchline. Karamo had refused to leave office, saying the vote to oust her was \u201cillegitimate.\u201d An unsigned statement issued by the state GOP called it a \u201cpolitical lynching.\u201d Her critics filed a lawsuit in state court to enforce the removal vote, and Karamo said only a judge\u2019s order could make her leave. In the meantime, she urged her followers to travel to Detroit on March 2 for a special convention. There, they would vote on her controversial plan to rewrite the Michigan GOP\u2019s constitution.\n\nAt his mid-February rally, Trump waded into the chaotic mess that was the Michigan Republican Party despite his supporters urging him not to. He described Hoekstra as \u201cyour new Michigan Republican Party chairman,\u201d a line that was greeted with a mix of cheers and boos. The boos continued as Trump said he\u2019d recommended Hoekstra for the job. \u201cI said, \u2018Do you think you could ever get this guy Hoekstra? He\u2019s unbelievable,\u2019\u201d Trump said.\n\nThe Trump campaign seemed to recognize that the longer Karamo remained in charge, the weaker the state party was and the less chance he had to win Michigan. For both Trump and Biden, Michigan is arguably a must-win state.\n\nStill, some of Trump\u2019s most ardent supporters saw his support for Hoekstra as a betrayal. \u201cI\u2019m not happy with Mr. Trump right now,\u201d one voter said at a Republican town hall I attended. \u201cI think he should keep his nose out of Michigan politics.\u201d When I asked Beyer what he thought, he said he suspected Trump was playing a double game. \u201cIf you know anything about election integrity, you know it\u2019s a rigged program here,\u201d he said. For Trump to win, \u201che\u2019s gotta join the riggers.\u201d I heard a Karamo supporter say she had read on \u201cTruth\u201d \u2014 meaning Truth Social, the social media platform partly owned by Trump \u2014 that Trump hadn\u2019t even written the endorsement of Hoekstra that appeared on his account.\n\nAround the time of Trump\u2019s visit to Michigan, I went to hear Karamo speak in Saginaw County, an hour and a half north of Detroit. The event was part of a barnstorming tour of the state meant to rally her supporters and assure them that she remained the party\u2019s legitimate leader. To her supporters, the date of the vote to remove her, Jan. 6, 2024, had taken on a mythological quality \u2014 it was the new Jan. 6. Their Jan. 6. The audience sat rapt as Karamo told them that it wasn\u2019t just 2020 and 2022 that were rigged. \u201cOur election system has been corrupted for decades. There\u2019s an entire network protecting the corrupt system.\u201d\n\nAt the end of her remarks, she reminded her supporters to go to Detroit on March 2. The date had taken on an outsize significance. Not only would delegates choose which presidential candidate received Michigan\u2019s 39 remaining delegates on the path to the Republican nomination, but they would vote on Karamo\u2019s constitution plan. Hoekstra, who was calling himself the rightful chair, was planning a separate event on the same day in Grand Rapids. The schism in the party would be on full display.\n\nA few days before the dueling conventions, a judge issued a preliminary ruling that Karamo had been properly removed. The Detroit convention was called off, and her constitutional overhaul was shelved for the time being. With Karamo\u2019s event canceled, Beyer, now a regional GOP chairman as well as a delegate, said he would carry the torch for the \u201cAmerica First\u201d movement. In an act of defiance aimed at \u201cAdolf\u201d Hoekstra, as Beyer called him, he and Studebaker announced their own miniconvention.\n\nOn the morning of March 2, Beyer picked me up at a Wendy\u2019s on the drive to his breakaway convention. A deluge of text messages lit up his phone as we drove down the highway. Beyer told me that the theme for Hoekstra\u2019s convention was \u201cUp From the Ashes.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fitting,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause they lit the match. They don\u2019t like the new group of people that have come in over the last two years.\u201d He paused. \u201cThey\u2019re burning down the Republican Party to get rid of people like me.\u201d\n\nAfter Beyer and Studebaker had run their protest convention, they jumped in Studebaker\u2019s truck and drove to Hoekstra\u2019s event in Grand Rapids. There, Studebaker ran into some operatives aligned with Trump\u2019s team in Michigan. Studebaker was furious with them and with Trump for abandoning Karamo and for, as he saw it, thwarting the will of the delegates.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to lose Michigan if he keeps doing this,\u201d Studebaker said. The delegates will still vote for Trump, he added, but they\u2019re not going to knock doors and they\u2019re not going to give money. They might tune out of state and national elections and focus on local races.\n\nThe operatives were unmoved. \u201cWe gotta go,\u201d one of them said. \u201cTrump stuff.\u201d\n\nA constituent wearing a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat at a state Republican convention in early March. Credit: Nick Hagen for ProPublica\n\nA Future Without Trump\n\nNot long afterward, Trump disappointed his grassroots followers again. In Michigan\u2019s high-stakes Republican Senate contest, Trump endorsed Mike Rogers, a former representative, all but assuring that Rogers would clinch the nomination in the August primary.\n\nAs for Peter Meijer, that throw-you-off-the-bridge exchange in the cafe in February had proved prophetic: His comeback bid was doomed. In late April, he dropped out.\n\nTrump\u2019s endorsement of Rogers left his supporters mystified. Like Meijer, he had been a vocal critic of Trump, once calling the former president \u201cmore gangster than presidential.\u201d He had chaired the powerful House intelligence committee, which led Trump followers to label him a member of the \u201cdeep state.\u201d A former aide to Trump had tweeted: \u201cCan\u2019t imagine a worse or more dangerous \u2018Republican\u2019 candidate for Senate than Mike Rogers.\u201d\n\nJim Copas, who quit his role with the party shortly before Karamo was forced out, told me he was disgusted with Trump\u2019s actions. \u201cI\u2019ve lost complete faith in the state GOP and I\u2019ve lost complete faith in the national GOP,\u201d he said. Speaking of Trump, he added: \u201cTo be honest, I think Don has learned a little bit about being a politician and he\u2019s forgotten his soul.\u201d\n\nBeyer hadn\u2019t given up on Trump. He still \u201cloved\u201d the man, he said, but he wasn\u2019t taking direction from Trump. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna always listen to him,\u201d Beyer told me. \u201cI\u2019m not part of a cult.\u201d\n\nHe had his own plans. In one of our last conversations, he laid out a more religious, more uncompromising version of the \u201cAmerica First\u201d movement. He had started his own PAC called Faith Family Freedom and he planned to target the precinct delegates around the state who had opposed Karamo and replace them with \u201cAmerica First\u201d allies in the next round of delegate elections this August. He had already signed up 350 supporters in various counties, he said, to help with his efforts.\n\nIf the Republican establishment \u2014 the DeVoses and the Meijers, Pete Hoekstra and the people who had voted to remove Karamo \u2014 fought him and his compatriots, Beyer stood ready. \u201cThey\u2019re not after Trump. They\u2019re not after Kristina,\u201d he told me. \u201cThey\u2019re after me. They\u2019re after everybody like me. That\u2019s what this is all about.\u201d",

        "text": "Will RFK Jr. qualify for the June presidential debate?\nThe 2024 election is already positioned to make history \u2014 Donald Trump is a convention away from becoming the first former president since 1892 to win a party\u2019s nomination after leaving office, while his contest against President Joe Biden is the first presidential rematch since 1956. And now the debates, too, have broken with the past: Last week, CNN announced that Biden and Trump had agreed to meet on June 27, which, should it happen, would mark the earliest-ever general election debate in a presidential race. CNN\u2019s event and a Sept. 10 debate announced by ABC News also circumvent the Commission on Presidential Debates, which has managed the process since 1988. This was something of a rare bipartisan move: The Republican National Committee had quit the CPD in 2022, Biden\u2019s team wanted no audience and both campaigns desired an earlier debate than the CPD\u2019s 2024 proposal called for.\n\nHaving secured their parties\u2019 presumptive nominations for some time now, Biden and Trump are eager to face off and pitch their respective cases to American voters. But the potential for a third candidate to qualify has made a Biden-Trump debate anything but a foregone conclusion. Both CNN and ABC News laid out rules that could open the door for independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to participate \u2014 a possibility that seemingly frustrated Biden\u2019s team. Were that to happen, Kennedy would be the first third-party presidential contender to make a debate since 1992. To qualify, candidates must attract at least 15 percent support in four national polls that meet CNN and ABC News\u2019s respective standards, while also having ballot access in enough states to theoretically win 270 electoral votes \u2014 thresholds Kennedy has not yet met.\n\nSo how close is Kennedy to making it? We\u2019ve taken a look at his standing in both polls and ballot access ahead of the June debate to see where things stand and just how realistic his chances are of qualifying for the initial event \u2014 even if doing so could end up scuttling the debates, should Biden opt out.\n\nTwo polls down, two to go\n\nAt this point, Kennedy looks to be halfway to meeting the polling requirement for CNN\u2019s June 27 debate. CNN established a window for eligible polls from March 13 through June 20, while also laying out 12 pollsters and/or media outlets whose surveys would be acceptable for the purposes of qualification. The rules also mandate that eligible polls measure views among registered or likely voters.\n\nBased on surveys released since mid-March that meet CNN\u2019s requirements, Kennedy has two qualifying polls to his name: A pair of late April surveys from CNN/SSRS and Quinnipiac University, each of which found Kennedy attracting 16 percent among registered voters. In eight other eligible polls that tested Kennedy, he fell short of 15 percent.\n\nThat Kennedy already has two qualifying polls makes it a very real possibility that he could end up with four by June 20. For one thing, he came very close to 15 percent in some other qualifying surveys, including 14 percent in the registered voter samples of Marquette University Law School\u2019s late March survey and Quinnipiac\u2019s latest poll. More broadly, Kennedy is polling just above 10 percent in 538\u2019s national polling average, so accounting for the variance we see from poll to poll, further 15 percent results are perfectly plausible. Additionally, the rules allow for multiple polls from the same pollster or sponsor to count toward qualification, so Kennedy would be able to count future polls from CNN/SSRS and Quinnipiac at that level of support.\n\nAt the same time, there might only be a handful of additional polls released in time to count for the CNN debate. Looking at recent national surveys, the universe of pollsters and sponsors who meet CNN\u2019s standards includes about a dozen potential pollster/sponsor combinations that might release polls between now and late June. The most regular is Quinnipiac, which just released a survey today and puts out a national poll on a monthly basis, more or less, so it might offer one more survey before the debate. The between-poll timing for other outlets tends to be longer, so it\u2019s hard to say how many more polls might come out in time for debate qualification. Of course, interest in the debate could drive media outlets and polling firms to ramp up their survey output as well. CNN/SSRS, with a direct connection to the first debate, would have a clear tie-in motivating the pollster and sponsor to put another poll in the field before late June.\n\nBallot access could be more complicated\n\nThe murkier part of the qualification rules lies in the requirement that candidates must also be on enough ballots to theoretically win 270 electoral votes, the minimum necessary to capture a majority in the Electoral College. At first blush, this rule would seemingly exclude Biden and Trump, because their parties won\u2019t formally nominate them until after the CNN debate \u2014 the GOP convention is in July, the Democratic confab in August. However, CNN appears to have made allowances for the reality that Biden and Trump are their parties\u2019 presumptive nominees. As a result, there\u2019s every expectation that both, as the two major-party nominees, will be on the ballot in all 50 states and Washington, D.C., totaling all 538 electoral votes in the Electoral College.\n\nKennedy, on the other hand, has a long way to go to secure ballot status in enough states to reach 270 electoral votes. Five states worth 35 electoral votes have confirmed to ABC News that Kennedy has made their ballots: Delaware, Hawaii, Michigan, Oklahoma and Utah. Kennedy\u2019s campaign claims that it has made the ballot in 10 other states worth 166 electoral votes, including the most vote-rich states of California and Texas. Overall, this would bring Kennedy to a potential total of 201 electoral votes, 69 electoral votes short of debate qualification if each of those states confirms that he has qualified by June 20, with additional states needed to make up the difference.\n\nHistorically, high-profile third-party or independent contenders like Ross Perot in 1992 and 1996 and John Anderson in 1980 made all 51 ballots, and Kennedy seems likely to eventually make the ballot in most places. But in past cycles, questions about ballot access usually had been answered by the time the general election debates rolled around. The unprecedented early date for the first 2024 debate casts doubt on whether Kennedy can attain ballot access in enough states in time to qualify. His campaign says it will have submitted signatures in enough states for 270 electoral votes, but that doesn't mean Kennedy's name will officially be on the ballot in each of those states by then.\n\nAfter all, the timing for each state\u2019s electoral administration to confirm that Kennedy has qualified will vary. For instance, Kennedy\u2019s campaign said it submitted nearly 246,000 petition signatures in Texas, more than twice as many as the roughly 113,000 required. The Texas secretary of state\u2019s office confirmed on May 13 that Kennedy\u2019s campaign had turned in its signatures, but it did not give a timeline for how long it would take to check their validity, so it\u2019s unclear whether the state\u2019s ballot status process will make Kennedy\u2019s status official in time for the debate. Furthermore, six other states where Kennedy has claimed-but-unconfirmed ballot status have deadlines in July or August for submitting signatures. There\u2019s no guarantee that each of these states will have formally placed Kennedy\u2019s name on the ballot in time, either.\n\nTo this point, consider the example of Perot\u2019s first presidential bid around the time he suspended his campaign on July 16, 1992 (he later jumped back into the race in early October). News reports at the time found that he had qualified for the ballot in 24 states worth 257 electoral votes, slightly less than the 270-majority mark. This is not necessarily an apples-to-apples comparison with Kennedy, who has accepted already-established ballot lines from minor parties in California, Delaware and Michigan in a way Perot did not in 1992 (California\u2019s secretary of state hasn\u2019t confirmed Kennedy\u2019s ballot access yet, but the American Independent Party has nominated him there). So while some states have changed their rules and timelines for ballot qualification since 1992, the Perot example demonstrates how realistic it would be for a major third-party contender to not necessarily have ballot access in enough states to meet the 270 mark by late June, despite easily getting there by November.\n\n***\n\nOver the next month, Kennedy could qualify for the June 27 debate. That would be a history-making event: Only twice since the dawn of presidential debates in 1960 has a third-party candidate made a general election debate stage. In 1992, Perot participated in all three debates against incumbent President George H.W. Bush and Democrat Bill Clinton. In 1980, Anderson debated Republican Ronald Reagan once without the participation of incumbent President Jimmy Carter, who refused to take part because Anderson had been invited.\n\nCould an incumbent once again skip out on a debate in 2024? And would a withdrawal by Biden scuttle the debate altogether? Ahead of the debate announcement, Biden\u2019s campaign seemed under the impression that it had only agreed to a one-on-one with Trump, making it possible that Biden could decide to withdraw should Kennedy qualify (Trump has said he\u2019d be open to Kennedy joining in). On the one hand, skipping out on a debate could make Biden look bad. On the other hand, his campaign wants to emphasize to voters that the election is, realistically, going to be a two-horse race. A Kennedy lectern, no matter how historical, would defeat that purpose.",

        "text": "Conservative activist launches campaign for people\u2019s veto of national popular vote law \u2022 Maine Morning Star\nCitizens and Republican lawmakers have launched a \u201cpeople\u2019s veto\u201d campaign in an attempt to repeal a measure that would pledge Maine\u2019s Electoral College votes to the winner of the national popular vote for president.\n\nOrganizers will now need to collect a little over 67,000 signatures by early August to put the issue on the ballot.\n\nLD 1578, which would make Maine part of the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, was approved by the Legislature in April, with the Democratic majority at the State House largely supporting the measure and Republicans mostly opposing it. States in the compact pledge their electoral votes to the presidential candidate with the most overall votes across the country rather than to the person that wins that particular state.\n\nGov. Janet Mills let the bill go into law without her signature, making Maine the 17th state to approve the agreement. If the people\u2019s veto effort fails and Maine indeed joins the compact, states with 209 total electoral votes will have ratified the agreement.\n\nThe compact would only actually be implemented if states with a total of 270 electoral votes join. That\u2019s because 270 electoral votes represents a simple majority in the Electoral College, meaning that the compact would guarantee that the winner of the national popular vote is elected president if it takes effect.\n\nFor proponents of the compact, the basic idea is to avoid situations like Donald Trump\u2019s victory in 2016 or George W. Bush\u2019s win in 2000, where the candidate with fewer overall votes was elected president by virtue of their Electoral College majority. Trump and Bush are both Republicans, and the GOP holds an advantage under the current Electoral College landscape, according to the Cook Political Report.\n\nBut some are not happy about the idea of Maine joining the compact, and the Secretary of State\u2019s office confirmed that it received a filing for a people\u2019s veto of the national popular vote bill on May 10 submitted by James DuPrie of Lebanon. Several Republican state lawmakers (Reps. Jeffrey Adams of Lebanon, David Boyer of Poland, John Andrews of South Paris and Barbara Bagshaw of Windham) also appear on the filing.\n\nIn an interview, DuPrie argued that moving to the national popular vote would minimize Mainers\u2019 voting power in presidential elections. (The current system provides smaller states with more statistical influence than a national popular vote structure would). As a result, he said Mainers deserve a say on the matter.\n\n\u201cRegardless of whether or not you think the popular vote is a good idea, that is not a decision that should be coming from the top,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not a legislative decision, that\u2019s a decision that should come from the voters.\u201d\n\nDuPrie \u2014 who said he has been active in local politics and within the Maine GOP but hasn\u2019t spearheaded a statewide referendum before \u2014 also believes the popular vote is the wrong way to elect a president. Under that system, he argued that big cities would have a stronger sway over the results than places like Maine. Still, he said that critique is of secondary importance to allowing voters to have a say via a referendum.\n\nIn pushing for the bill, however, proponents have cast the national popular vote compact as a basic democracy reform and argued that the candidate with the most total votes should win the presidency. Supporters also say the compact would safeguard the principle of one person, one vote and move the country away from a system that currently magnifies the influence of a small handful of swing states at the expense of other states such as Maine.\n\n\u201cI for one believe that my vote is not worth more, nor is it worth less, than any other adult American who exercises their right to vote regardless of which U.S. state that they happen to live in,\u201d Sen. Nicole Grohoski (D-Hancock) said in March.\n\nAs the people\u2019s veto effort gets underway, DuPrie acknowledged that the campaign has little time to waste. State law provides 90 days from the adjournment of the legislative session to turn in at least 67,682 valid signatures \u2014 equal to 10% of the votes cast for governor in 2022 \u2014 meaning the campaign has until Aug. 8.\n\nDuPrie said the goal is to have every polling location staffed with signature-gatherers for the state\u2019s June 11 primary elections, although he admitted that might be difficult. The campaign will also be attending other political events and gatherings like town fairs to try to collect the necessary number of petitions.\n\nOnce the signatures are turned in, the Secretary of State\u2019s office has 30 business days to review them. If the office determines the petition benchmark has been met, LD 1578 would be stayed and the question of whether Maine will join the national popular vote compact would go to the voters.\n\nHowever, Secretary of State\u2019s office spokesperson Emily Cook said the issue can\u2019t go on this year\u2019s ballot if notice of the referendum is given fewer than 60 days before the general election. Therefore, signatures would have to be verified and a proclamation for a people\u2019s veto referendum sent out by Sept. 6 for the issue to appear on the November 2024 ballot.\n\nGiven that, Cook said whether the people\u2019s veto appears on the November ballot depends on \u201cwhen the signatures are turned in and how quickly we are able to review them.\u201d If the campaign gathers the needed signatures but they aren\u2019t reviewed in time for the issue to go on the 2024 ballot, it would be voted on during the next statewide or general election in Maine.\n\nDuPrie said his primary focus right now is on the signature-collecting effort. However, he said he\u2019d prefer the referendum to happen in 2024 because it\u2019s a presidential year where voter turnout is likely to be higher.",

        "text": "Election 2024: Your Ballot's in the Mail\nSince its founding, A Grand Alliance to Save Our Public Postal Service has led the charge in advocating for expanded services as a means to save the Post Office, to cement its role in our society, and to fend off efforts to slash postal services.\n\nIf you\u2019ve somehow missed the widespread TV ads and lawn signs that have popped up recently, 2024 is a presidential election year. That means one critical expanded postal service is going to be put to the test in the months ahead: Vote-by-Mail.\n\nThis year will be a critical one for Vote-by-Mail advocates for a number of reasons. Access to mail-in and early voting has grown significantly in recent years. Advocates of the public Postal Service have an important job to do of assuring voters that the postal system is a safe, secure, and reliable way for them to cast their vote.\n\nThere are serious threats to voting rights in general, and to Vote-by-Mail in particular, which are sure to be hallmarks of this year\u2019s political campaigns. Defeating those who would like to see Vote-by-Mail fail is also critical to its long-term success, its contribution to the Postal Service, and to the vibrancy of our democratic institutions.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s look at how Vote-by-Mail has expanded in recent years. In the 2000 general election, just 21 states allowed for \u201cno-excuse\u201d mail-in voting, representing less than 40 percent of all eligible voters. This year, voters in 36 states and Washington, DC can exercise their right to vote by mailing in their ballot.\n\nBut, while Vote-by-Mail has become more accessible for more American voters, serious threats remain to its existence. Perhaps most visibly, one of the two major presidential candidates continues to rail against Vote-by- Mail. After attempting to discredit it as \u201cfraudulent\u201d and calling the Postal Service \u201ca joke\u201d during the 2020 election, former President Trump has continued his assault on mail-in balloting, claiming recently, \u201cany time the mail is involved, you\u2019re going to have cheating.\u201d\n\nThose claims, of course, have been thoroughly discredited. From court cases to academic studies, every serious observer has concluded that voting by mail is one of the safest and most secure methods of casting one\u2019s vote. What\u2019s more, while there\u2019s ample evidence that shows Vote-by-Mail increases overall voter participation, it has also been shown to have no meaningful benefit to one political party over another.\n\nIf the damaging rhetoric wasn\u2019t enough, political lawyers have been busy in court trying to make mail-in voting more difficult in the upcoming election. While states have generally made efforts to expand the use of Vote-by-Mail, opponents of our democratic rights are attempting to use the courts to claw back this expansion of our voting rights.\n\nOf course, the 2020 election was a singularly important moment for Vote-by-Mail. During the height of the pandemic, more than 65 million people relied upon the Postal Service to ensure they could vote in the general election. And, despite the threats of Covid and the politically-charged atmosphere, postal workers delivered in record fashion, delivering 97 percent of ballots within their service standards and 99.7 percent of all ballots within seven days. To defeat those who are attacking our democracy, and attacking our public Postal Service, we\u2019ll need to do it again in 2024.\n\nMany Grand Alliance members will be actively engaged in voter turnout efforts in the upcoming election. As postal workers, you can do your part by ensuring your neighbors, friends, and pro-postal allies that postal workers are committed to serving our country again in this year\u2019s election. \u25a0",

        "text": "Americans have mixed views about how the news media cover Biden\u2019s, Trump\u2019s ages\nPresident Joe Biden in 2023 and then-President Donald Trump in 2021. (Jim Watson/AFP and Brendan Smialowski/AFP, both via Getty Images)\n\nAt age 81, Joe Biden is already the oldest president in American history. But former President Donald Trump, who will turn 78 in June, will become the oldest person ever elected president \u2013 surpassing Biden \u2013 if he wins back the White House this year.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise, then, that the ages of the candidates have been a major topic of conversation in news coverage of the 2024 presidential election. A new Pew Research Center survey finds that Americans have mixed feelings about the way news organizations are handling the issue for each candidate, with views sharply divided by political party.\n\nHow we did this To examine Americans\u2019 perceptions of news coverage of the 2024 U.S. presidential candidates, Pew Research Center surveyed 8,709 U.S. adults from April 8 to April 14, 2024. Everyone who completed the survey is a member of the Center\u2019s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. This way nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. Read more about the ATP\u2019s methodology. Here are the questions used for this analysis, along with responses, and the survey methodology. Pew Research Center is a subsidiary of The Pew Charitable Trusts, its primary funder. This is the latest analysis in Pew Research Center\u2019s ongoing investigation of the state of news, information and journalism in the digital age, a research program funded by The Pew Charitable Trusts, with generous support from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation.\n\nOverall, similar shares of U.S. adults believe news organizations are giving too much attention (32%) or too little attention (29%) to Biden\u2019s age. An additional 38% think the media cover Biden\u2019s age about the right amount.\n\nBy comparison, Americans are less likely to say the news media are overemphasizing Trump\u2019s age (19%) and more likely to think that news organizations give it about the right amount of attention (49%).\n\nThe same survey found that a larger share of American voters express confidence that Trump has the physical and mental fitness needed to be president than say the same about Biden.\n\nAmericans\u2019 opinions on news coverage are split along party lines. Each party\u2019s supporters tend to say that the opposing candidate\u2019s age is getting too little attention.\n\nNearly half of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (46%) say news organizations are giving Trump\u2019s age too little attention, compared with just 14% of Republicans and GOP leaners.\n\nThe numbers are virtually flipped when it comes to Biden: 48% of Republicans say Biden\u2019s age is getting too little attention, while only 12% of Democrats say the same.\n\nWhen it comes to coverage of their own party\u2019s candidate, patterns within each party differ. While 48% of Democrats say that Biden\u2019s age is getting too much attention, far fewer Republicans (23%) hold this view about Trump. Instead, most Republicans (63%) say Trump\u2019s age is getting about the right amount of attention.\n\nAny differences between older and younger Americans are much smaller than the gaps between partisans. Among Americans ages 65 and older, for example, 34% say news organizations give Biden\u2019s age too little attention. That compares with 29% of those ages 50 to 64, 27% of those ages 30 to 49 and 26% of adults under 30.\n\nNote: Here are the questions used for this analysis, along with responses, and the survey methodology. Senior Researcher Kirsten Eddy and Research Assistant Emily Tomasik contributed to this analysis.",

However, calculating the percentage of voter turnout could be tricky because Democrats and unaffiliated voters were allowed to vote in the caucus.\n\nThe Idaho Secretary of State\u2019s Office reports there are 125,585 registered Democratic voters in the state. Based only on the pool of 125,585 Democratic voters, turnout could be calculated at about 1.9%, but that calculation would ignore the fact that some unaffiliated voters did vote in the Democratic caucus. The Democratic Party did not indicate the number of unaffiliated voters who cast ballots Thursday.\n\nAcross the Gem State, there are 273,862 unaffiliated voters, according to the Idaho Secretary of State\u2019s Office.\n\nAt any rate, Biden\u2019s victory was never in doubt. As the incumbent president, Biden had already secured enough delegates to clinch the Democratic Party\u2019s nomination for president.\n\nThe presidential caucus is new for Idaho voters this year because the Idaho Legislature seemingly unintentionally eliminated the presidential primary election in Idaho by passing House Bill 138 during the 2023 legislative session. The Idaho Republican Party held its presidential caucus on March 2. The Idaho Republican Party announced that former President Donald J. Trump won Idaho\u2019s GOP caucus.\n\nVoters, officials say they prefer a primary election rather than a presidential caucus\n\nSeveral Democratic caucus goers and elected officials told the Idaho Capital Sun that they would prefer to vote for president in a primary election instead of a separate caucus.\n\nNeed to get in touch? Have a news tip? CONTACT US\n\n\u201cIt seems pretty easy, but I don\u2019t know why we have primaries and a caucus,\u201d voter Sally Davies-Sexton told the Idaho Capital Sun after casting her vote for Biden at the Timberline High School caucus site in Boise on Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s just having two events, and then this is not exactly around the corner.\u201d\n\nIdaho\u2019s primary election, which did not feature presidential candidates, took place earlier in the week on Tuesday.\n\nVoter Mary Ruckh has volunteered as a poll worker and served as a chief elections judge at a polling site during Tuesday\u2019s Idaho primary election. Ruckh rode her bicycle to the Timberline High School caucus site to vote for Biden, but said she would have preferred to vote in a primary election. Primary elections are run by county elections offices and the state, while a caucus is run by the political parties.\n\n\u201cA primary \u2013 it\u2019s so much more structured, it\u2019s under the egis of government,\u201d Ruckh said.\n\nRuckh did say this year\u2019s Democratic presidential caucus was a major improvement over the most recent Democratic caucus in 2016, which was marred by long lines that many voters endured for hours.\n\nIdaho House Minority Leader Ilana Rubel, D-Boise, told the Sun on Thursday that the Idaho Legislature needs to reinstate a presidential primary.\n\n\u201cWe very much wanted a primary, because we were really concerned about the limitations on a caucus and whether that would restrict full participation,\u201d Rubel said.\n\n\u201cI certainly hope before the next presidential race that we are able to restore a primary,\u201d Rubel added.\n\nIdaho Democratic Party rules allowed voters who will turn 18 years old by the Nov. 5 general election to register to vote and vote in Thursday\u2019s presidential caucus.\n\nKennedy Fletcher, a 17-year-old first-time voter, received a round of applause from Democratic volunteers and other voters when she turned in her ballot Thursday night at Timberline High School. Fletcher told the Sun she is supporting Biden because of the clear differences between him and Trump.\n\n\u201cI like getting involved politically. I know who I am going to vote for and everything, and I am really excited to vote in the actual presidential election,\u201d Fletcher said.\n\nIdaho Democratic Party Chair Lauren Necochea, who is also the outgoing House assistant minority leader, said she wasn\u2019t surprised to see Biden perform strongly in Thursday\u2019s caucus. Necochea said the party will unify strongly behind Biden heading into the Nov. 5 Election Day.\n\n\u201cPresident Biden is the only person who has beaten President Trump in a presidential election,\u201d Necochea said.\n\nIdaho Democrats allowed absentee voting, media coverage\n\nWhile the Idaho Republican Party\u2019s March 2 caucus required voters to participate only in person, the Idaho Democratic Party allowed voters request and mail in an absentee ballot if they were unable to attend due to military or religious service, work, disability, illness, child care obligations or the inability to travel.\n\nThe Idaho Democratic Party also allowed news reporters to observe the caucus and interview voters. The Idaho Republican Party did not allow news reporters who are not affiliated with the Republican Party to observe its caucus.",

The growth in registered voters is not spread equally around the state, but follows recent changes in general population growth.\n\nU.S. President\n\nThe latest polls: Three new polls released this last week prior to the election again show the Harris-Walz Democratic ticket leading the Trump-Vance Republican ticket here in Minnesota:\n\nA new KSTP/SurveyUSA poll, conducted Oct. 24-28, shows Vice President Kamala Harris leading former President Trump by eight percentage points (51 percent to 43 percent).\n\nThe latest MinnPost/Embold Research poll, conducted Oct. 16-22, shows the presidential race in Minnesota statistically tied, with Harris\u2019 three percentage point lead over Trump well within the survey\u2019s margin of error.\n\nThe Cooperative Election Study, an academic research consortium based out of Tufts and Harvard Universities, released their massive biennial pre-election survey which included Minnesota and 12 other states. This survey, conducted Oct. 1-25 by YouGov, found Harris up by ten percentage points among their model of likely voters in Minnesota.\n\nAdding these results to the 16 other polls conducted in Minnesota since President Joe Biden dropped out of the race brings the state\u2019s polling average to a six percentage point advantage for the Harris campaign, with an average of 49 percent of voters supporting the Democratic ticket and 43 percent supporting the Republican ticket.\n\nLooking only at the five polls conducted in October, Harris\u2019 average lead is just over seven percentage points in Minnesota.\n\nNote: Three firms not so far included in our tracking publicly released poll results for Minnesota on Nov. 1, 2 and 4, respectively. Although all three show results similar to other polls, at this time we are not adding these late-breaking polls to our trendline and average, due to either questionable methods, potential bias and/or lack of transparency around the methodology.\n\nTechnically, when taken on their own the results of 12 of the 19 polls taken in Minnesota to date are within the margin of error. So, given the closeness of the race and relatively small sample sizes, any of these 12 polls cannot definitively say that Harris is ahead. This is especially the case given that four percent of likely voters remain undecided according to polls taken in September and into October. The error margins also mean, however, that Harris\u2019 current lead could be even larger than reflected in any given poll result.\n\nThe consistency of Harris\u2019 lead across all polls, however, and the statistically significant lead in four of the most recent five polls, suggests that she would prevail in the state if the election were held today.\n\nMPR News' voter guide Everything you need to know to prepare for voting in Minnesota's local, state and federal elections\n\nThe picture has improved for the Democratic ticket in the state since President Biden withdrew from the race on July 21. Prior to that time polling had generally shown Biden with a slight lead in Minnesota \u2014 3 percentage points on average \u2014 but that ultimately the race was too close to call when factoring in the undecided voters and the error margins or credibility intervals that accompanied each poll\u2019s results.\n\n\n\nElection forecasts: Leading election forecasters have rated the race for Minnesota\u2019s 10 electoral votes as follows.\n\nThe Economist : Very likely Democrat\n\nHarris has a 90 percent chance of winning Minnesota as of their Oct. 28 daily update. Nationally their model has the race \u201cextremely close\u201d with Trump winning 54 of 100 election simulations.\n\nABC News/538 : Likely Democrat\n\nAs of their Oct. 28 daily update Harris has an 81 percent chance of winning in Minnesota. Their forecast for the state was updated from \u201cleans Democrat\u201d on Aug. 23. Nationally 538 has Trump slightly ahead with a 54 percent chance of winning.\n\nSabato\u2019s Crystal Ball /UVA Center for Politics: Likely Democrat\n\nAs of Sept. 25. UVA updated the state from \u201cleans Democrat\u201d on Aug. 20. Nationally UVA has the race as too close to call.\n\nInside Elections : Leans Democrat\n\nAs of their Aug. 29 update.

Nationally NPR has the race as too close to call.\n\nBackground: Minnesota has the nation\u2019s longest streak among all states for favoring a Democrat for president. A Republican has not won the presidential race in Minnesota since 1972, when Republican President Richard Nixon defeated Democratic nominee George McGovern by 5.5 percentage points. In 2020, Democrat Joe Biden won the state by a margin of 7.1 percentage points over then-President Donald Trump. In 2016, Trump also lost the state, but only by 1.5 percentage points.\n\nBoth the Democrats and Republicans have faced setbacks in this year\u2019s presidential campaign:\n\nHarris announced that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz would be her vice presidential running mate on Aug. 6. Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who was running for president as an independent, announced that he was suspending his candidacy and backing Trump on Aug. 23. Technically Kennedy remains on the ballot in some states, including Minnesota.\n\nOther candidates on Minnesota\u2019s ballot this fall are Chase Oliver and Mike ter Maat (Libertarian Party); Jill Stein and Samson Kpadenou (Green Party); Claudia De la Cruz and Karina Garcia (Socialism and Liberation); Rachele Fruit and Dennis Richter (Socialist Workers Party); Cornel West and Melina Abdullah (Justice for All); Shiva Ayyadurai and Crystal Ellis (Independent). Minnesotans also have the opportunity to write-in candidates of their choosing.\n\nJump to: President | Senate | CD1 | CD2 | CD3\n\nCD4 | CD5 | CD6 | CD7 | CD8\n\nU.S. Senate\n\nThe latest polls: Incumbent Sen. Amy Klobuchar leads Republican challenger Royce White by twelve percentage points, 52 percent to 40 percent, in a poll of Minnesota likely voters conducted Oct. 16-22 by Embold Research on behalf of MinnPost.\n\nThe next most recent poll, by Redfield and Wilton Strategies on behalf of The Telegraph, found a narrower race, with Klobuchar ahead by only seven percentage points. Redfield and Wilton\u2019s polling in the state has consistently found the race tighter than have other pollsters; their five polls to date show Klobuchar ahead by an average of seven points, compared to Klobuchar\u2019s 13.5 point average lead in the seven other polls conducted on the race since June.\n\nRedfield and Wilton also find considerably more Minnesota voters undecided about the race. The results of The Telegraph/Redfield and Wilton polls have been surprising given the contrast with the other public polls conducted on the race so far this year. For example, the MPR News | StarTribune | KARE11 Minnesota Poll and a poll by MinnPost and Embold Research, both published in Sept., showed Klobuchar with an 11 percentage point lead.\n\nThe results of the Telegraph\u2019s polls regarding Minnesota\u2019s presidential race are similar to the results from other pollsters, and nothing obvious in their stated methodology excludes them from our tracker. We have requested comment on their Senate race findings, but have yet to hear back.\n\nMPR News' voter guide:\n\nPolls conducted in June and earlier showed Klobuchar ahead of Joe Fraser by 10 to 17 percentage points. Fraser was also running for the seat as a Republican until losing to White in the August primary.\n\nElection forecasts: Leading election forecasters have rated Minnesota\u2019s U.S. Senate race as follows:\n\nThe Economist : Solid Democrat\n\nAs of their Oct. 27 daily update their predictions show Sen. Klobuchar has a 96% chance of winning. Nationally, their model favors Republicans winning control of the Senate, winning 70 in 100 of their model simulations.\n\nABC News/538 : Solid Democrat\n\nAs of their Oct. 27 daily update (specifically, their model shows Sen. Klobuchar with a 98% chance of winning).

Nationally IE forecasts that Republicans will win 2-4 seats, thereby narrowly gaining control of the Senate.\n\nCook Political Report : Solid Democrat\n\nAs of their Oct. 21 update. Nationally Cook forecasts that 51 seats will be held by Democrats, 49 by Republicans.\n\nSabato\u2019s Crystal Ball, UVA Center for Politics: Safe/Solid Democrat\n\nAs of their Oct. 24 update. Nationally UVA forecasts that Republicans will gain control of the Senate, specifically that 51 seats will be held by Republicans, 48 by Democrats and that one seat is too close to call.\n\nIncumbent job approval: Sen. Klobuchar has enjoyed strong job approval ratings from Minnesota voters ever since she assumed office. The most recent KSTP/WDIO/KAAL poll done by Survey USA shows that 54 percent of Minnesota voters approve of Klobuchar\u2019s job performance as senator and 36 percent disapprove.\n\nBackground: Incumbent DFL Sen. Amy Klobuchar is seeking reelection to the seat she has occupied since 2007. She won her last election in 2018 by a 24 percentage point margin.\n\nPrior to the Minnesota Republican Convention in mid-May, the GOP\u2019s presumed challenger to Klobuchar was Navy veteran Joe Fraser, who was running with the encouragement of prominent Republicans in Washington. Delegates to the convention, however, endorsed Royce White, a podcaster and former professional basketball player. White also prevailed in the Aug. 13 primary, firming his position as Klobuchar\u2019s challenger in the race.\n\nJump to: President | Senate | CD1 | CD2 | CD3\n\nCD4 | CD5 | CD6 | CD7 | CD8\n\nCongressional District 1\n\nMinnesota U.S. House District 1 Elisabeth Gawthrop | APM Research Lab\n\nBackground: In 2022 Republican Rep. Brad Finstad prevailed by 11.5 percentage points in an open race against DFL challenger Jeff Ettinger.\n\nThis year Finstad faces DFLer Rachel Bohman, who touts herself as a \u201cRochester native \u2026 a former local elected official on the Rochester Township Board \u2026 a former Assistant County Attorney \u2026 [and] most importantly, a mom.\u201d\n\nWhile, two other Republicans \u2014 Gregory Goetzman and Shawn Tweten \u2014 officially filed for the seat, Finstad easily won in the Aug. 13 Republican primary.\n\nThis southern Minnesota district \u2014 which includes regional centers Albert Lea, Mankato, Rochester (home of Mayo Clinic) and Worthington \u2014 has been represented by a Republican since 2019 when the seat was vacated by current Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (DFL).\n\nNote that along with all districts in the state, the boundaries of the 1st Congressional District changed somewhat in 2022, remaining a majority Republican district according to 2020 presidential voting patterns, but just slightly more favorable for the DFL.\n\nPolling: No public polling to report for the race in this district.\n\nElection forecasts: Leading election forecasters have rated the race in Minnesota\u2019s CD1 as follows:\n\nABC News/538 : Solid Republican\n\nAs of their Oct. 27 daily update.

Angie Craig has held the seat for three terms after flipping the seat in a successful challenge of Republican Jason Lewis in 2018. In 2022, Craig was reelected by a 5 percentage point margin over Republican challenger Tyler Kistner.\n\nCraig\u2019s main challenger this year is Joe Teirab, a former Marine, Harvard Law graduate and former federal prosecutor. Republicans had endorsed Tayler Rahm in the race, but in July Rahm stepped down to serve as senior advisor leading the Trump campaign in Minnesota.\n\nIn addition, two other candidates have officially filed to run for the seat; DFLer Marc Ives and Constitutional Conservative Thomas William Bowman. Craig and Teirab easily won their respective party primary elections on Aug. 13.\n\nNote that along with all districts in the state, the boundaries of the 2nd Congressional District changed somewhat in 2022, remaining a majority DFL district according to 2020 presidential voting patterns, and moving just slightly more favorable for the DFL.\n\nPolling: A KSTP/SurveyUSA poll conducted Oct. 7-13 among 556 likely voters in the Second District found a close race: Forty-nine percent of voters favored Craig while 41 percent favored Teirab and three percent favored independent Tom Bowman. Craig\u2019s 9 point lead is just beyond the survey\u2019s credibility interval, and seven percent of voters indicated that they were undecided.\n\nElection forecasts: Leading election forecasters have rated the race in Minnesota\u2019s CD2 as follows:\n\nABC News/538 : Likely Democrat\n\nAs of their Oct. 27 daily update.

Dean Phillips has held this seat \u2014 which includes many of Minneapolis\u2019s northern, western and southern suburbs \u2014 since flipping it from Republican Erik Paulsen in 2018. The seat is now open since Phillips backed out to mount a now-discontinued run for president.\n\nDespite the fact that Phillips was reelected by a 19 percentage point margin in 2022, Republicans are hoping to reclaim the district. Tad Jude, a former Democrat who served in the Minnesota Legislature and later as a county commissioner and judge, was endorsed by the district\u2019s GOP in late April. State Sen. Kelly Morrison, a physician, is the DFL\u2019s candidate.\n\nNote that along with all districts in the state, the boundaries of the 3rd Congressional District changed somewhat in 2022, remaining a majority DFL district according to 2020 presidential voting patterns, and moving just slightly more favorable for the DFL.\n\nPolling: No public polling to report for the race in this district.\n\nElection forecasts: Leading election forecasters have rated the race in Minnesota\u2019s CD3 as follows:\n\nABC News/538 : Solid Democrat\n\nAs of their Oct. 27 daily update.

Betty McCollum since 2001. That makes her the longest-serving member of the state\u2019s federal delegation. In 2022, she prevailed over Republican challenger May Lor Xiong by 35 percentage points.\n\nXiong as well as fellow Republican Gene Rechtzigel officially filed to challenge McCollum for the seat, but Xiong won the Republican primary on Aug. 13.\n\nNote that along with all districts in the state, the boundaries of the 4rth Congressional District changed somewhat in 2022, remaining a strong DFL district according to 2020 presidential voting patterns.\n\nPolling: No public polling to report for the race in this district.\n\nElection forecasts: Leading election forecasters have rated the race in Minnesota\u2019s CD4 as follows:\n\nABC News/538 : Solid Democrat\n\nAs of their Oct. 27 daily update.

Ilhan Omar since 2018. She became the first refugee, first Somali-American and, along with Michigan\u2019s Rashida Tlaib, first Muslim woman elected to Congress.\n\nIn 2022, Omar prevailed in the general election by 50 percentage points. In this heavily DFL-leaning district she faced a more challenging threat in the 2022 primaries from former Minneapolis city council member Don Samuels, winning by only 2 percentage points.\n\nSamuels challenged Omar in the DFL primaries again in 2024. In addition, two other DFL candidates \u2014 Abena A. McKenzie and Nate Schluter \u2014 officially filed for the seat. Omar prevailed in the Aug. 13 DFL primary, receiving 56 percent of the vote.\n\nIraq-born journalist and activist Dalia al-Aqidi is the Republican challenger.\n\nNote that along with all districts in the state, the boundaries of the 5th Congressional District changed somewhat in 2022, but remained the state\u2019s strongest DFL district according to 2020 presidential voting patterns.\n\nPolling: No public polling to report for the race in this district.\n\nElection forecasts: Leading election forecasters have rated the race in Minnesota\u2019s CD5 as follows:\n\nABC News/538 : Solid Democrat\n\nAs of their Oct. 27 daily update.

In 2022, Emmer prevailed over DFL challenger Jeanne Hendricks by 44 percentage points.\n\nHendricks, \u201ca nurse anesthetist, mom of two adult children, and community activist\u201d won the DFL endorsement in May. In addition, Austin Winkelman, who is currently pursing undergraduate studies in business, formally filed his candidacy as a DFL candidate for the seat.

Michelle Fischbach in 2020. Even before Fischbach won the seat, the district leaned right, voting for President Trump by a wide margin in 2016.\n\nIn 2022 Fischbach was reelected with a 39 percentage point margin. She faces a primary challenge from businessman Stephen Boyd. Neither was endorsed at the spring GOP district convention, but Fischbach won the Aug. 13 primary, receiving nearly two-thirds of the district\u2019s Republican votes.\n\nAJ Peters, a scientist, business owner and educator, is the DFL\u2019s endorsed candidate for the district.

In 2018, Republican Rep. Pete Stauber successfully flipped this long-time DFL stronghold in a 6 percentage point open-seat victory over DFLer Joe Radinovich.\n\nStauber has successfully defended the seat in the two elections since then, including a 14-point victory over DFL challenger Jen Schultz in 2022.\n\nSchultz, a former state legislator, is challenging Stauber again this year. In addition, DFLer John Munter and Republican Harry Welty officially filed as candidates for the seat, but on Aug. 13 Stauber and Shultz each easily won their respective party primaries.\n\nNote that along with all districts in the state, the boundaries of the 8th Congressional District changed somewhat in 2022, remaining a majority Republican district according to 2020 presidential voting patterns, but just slightly more favorable for the DFL.\n\nPolling: No public polling to report for the race in this district.\n\nElection forecasts: Leading election forecasters have rated the race in Minnesota\u2019s CD8 as follows:\n\nABC News/538 : Solid Republican\n\nAs of their Oct. 27 daily update.

        "text": "In key Oregon swing district, US House candidates face uphill battle for moderate vote\nCampaign images of Republican U.S. Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer, left, and Democrat Janelle Bynum, candidates in Oregon\u2019s 5th Congressional District race in November 2024. Courtesy of the campaigns / OPB\n\nThe stage is set, and it\u2019s a rematch.\n\nTHANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor\n\nThe candidates for Oregon\u2019s 5th Congressional District \u2014 state Rep. Janelle Bynum and Republican U.S. Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer \u2014 have gone head-to-head twice before in Oregon House races in the Portland suburbs.\n\nBut now they\u2019ll face off in a new territory, a swing district that in 2022 was decided by just two percentage points. In a presidential election year all but certain to divide Americans along national party lines, political experts say these two candidates will confront unique challenges appealing to a key group: moderate voters.\n\nIn the 2022 general election, more than a quarter of the votes in Oregon\u2019s 5th Congressional District \u2014 nearly 100,000 people \u2014 came from people who registered as non-affiliated or with the Independent Party, according to Oregon Secretary of State voter registration data.\n\nRelated: Primary election: Get the latest news and see detailed vote counts\n\nAs of this month, about 40% of the region\u2019s registered voters are non-affiliated or independent, data show. That\u2019s 214,703 people, or about 20,000 more than the same time in 2022.\n\n\u201cIf the race proves to be very close, then a small middle ground that may consist of people who might be willing to shift their view may prove to be important,\u201d said Richard Clucas, a political science professor at Portland State University.\n\nHouse Republicans represent 16 districts that President Joe Biden won in 2020. Oregon\u2019s 5th Congressional District is one of them. That places this year\u2019s election in the national political crosshairs, a race that experts say could once again be decided by a slim margin.\n\nBynum has won each time the candidates have battled before. Repeatedly, she touted this fact in her victorious primary campaign against Jamie McLeod-Skinner over the past few months. But those victories came in a much smaller, suburban area around Happy Valley in Clackamas County.\n\nNow she\u2019ll face Chavez-DeRemer in a district that includes large swaths of rural Oregon, communities that have historically favored Republicans and were key to the U.S. representative\u2019s victory in 2022.\n\nTHANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor\n\nThough she lost in Clackamas, Multnomah and Deschutes counties in 2022, the Chavez-DeRemer\u2019s most resounding victories came in Linn and Marion counties, which encompass many of the district\u2019s smallest communities.\n\nAnd Bynum will face additional challenges wooing voters who might be frustrated with Portland\u2019s direction and disenchanted with the state\u2019s Democratic establishment, many of whom have endorsed her.\n\n\u201cDemocrats control the state in Oregon, so she will be kind of associated with that,\u201d said Ben Gaskins, a political science professor at Lewis & Clark College. \u201cAnd to the degree that voters see the state government and the local government as a failure, that\u2019s something that she\u2019s going to be associated with and something that Chavez-DeRemer is definitely going to try to connect her to.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cBynum will have to toe a careful line.\u201d\n\nAnd so will Chavez-DeRemer, experts say. Gathering support from moderate voters could prove difficult given her endorsement of former President Donald Trump and her backing of Louisiana Rep. Mike Johnson as speaker of the House of Representatives, who Democrats have labeled an extremist.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t get away from the connection with Donald Trump,\u201d Gaskins said. \u201cHe looms large over politics everywhere, and in a swing race she will be connected to him.\u201d\n\nAt her election watch party on Tuesday, Bynum wasted no time associating Chavez-DeRemer with Trump, his Make America Great Again movement and the fall of abortion rights in America.\n\nShe criticized the congresswoman\u2019s voting record on reproductive rights issues, adding she \u201cproudly endorsed Donald Trump while gutting funding for the critical services that Oregonians rely on.\u201d Bynum\u2019s statement was met with a chorus of boos from her supporters.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what Lori Chavez-DeRemer has to combat against, to show she\u2019s not just a national, go-along player,\u201d Jim Moore, a political science professor and administrator at Pacific University, said in April.\n\nTo garner support, experts say they expect Chavez-DeRemer to focus on local issues \u2014 housing affordability, child care, homelessness \u2014 and her accomplishments in Congress, rather than national politics. But avoiding the connection with Trump might prove impossible.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure there will be millions that will be spent that will be reminding voters of her past behavior,\u201d said Clucas. \u201cShe\u2019s going to have to find somewhere to make inroads to the other side, so it does make sense to try to moderate her perspective and downplay some things. But it seems like Trump doesn\u2019t always like people who try to distance themselves from him.\u201d\n\nIn a statement Tuesday kicking off the general election, Chavez-DeRemer touted an analysis that indicated she had the second-most bipartisan voting record in Congress.\n\n\u201cAs an independent voice for Oregon, I\u2019ve worked across the aisle to lower costs, tackle the fentanyl crisis, and reduce crime,\u201d Chavez-DeRemer said. \u201cI\u2019m honored to have such a strong coalition of support from Oregonians of all backgrounds \u2014 Republicans, Democrats, and Independents \u2014 and I\u2019ll continue fighting tirelessly to grow our movement so we can keep building a better Oregon by advancing commonsense solutions.\u201d",

        "text": "Trump again vows to deport millions of migrants. Could he really do it?\n\"It's going to be a mess,\" one immigration expert told ABC News.\n\nTrump again vows to deport millions of migrants. Could he really do it?\n\nHe said he would do it in his first term.\n\nNow, with immigration a top issue for voters in November, Donald Trump says, if elected again, he's determined to carry out his threat: to round up and deport millions of migrants living in the U.S. without legal permission.\n\nTo do so, the former president said he would use local law enforcement and the National Guard to find such migrants living across the U.S. He also hasn't ruled out building detention camps on U.S. soil or activating the military as part of the effort.\n\n\"On Day 1 of my new administration, I will seal the border, stop the invasion of people pouring through our border and send Joe Biden's illegal aliens back home where they belong,\" Trump said at a recent rally in Wildwood, New Jersey. \"They have got to be sent home.\"\n\nIt's a proposal immigration experts and advocates say is extreme, and would have major consequences if implemented.\n\n\"It's going to be a mess and it's going to be a nightmare,\" David Leopold, a former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, told ABC News. \"There is no economic or social rationale for it other than a hateful ideology.\"\n\nRepublican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump gestures to the crowd during a campaign rally in Wildwood, N.J., May 11, 2024. Matt Rourke/AP\n\nThere are about 11 million unauthorized migrants living in the U.S., according to the most recent estimates from the Department of Homeland Security. The overwhelming majority of the population (79%) have been in the country since before 2010, DHS found -- though the report contains numbers through 2022, before the historic influx in border crossings.\n\nData from the immigration advocacy group FWD.us found that 22 million people in the U.S. live in a mixed-status household where at least one undocumented person lives with U.S. citizens, green card holders or other lawful residents.\n\n\u201cThese policies will touch every single American,\u201d said Kica Matos, the president of the National Immigration Law Center.\n\n\"We're talking about broken communities, families being separated, racial profiling, the trampling of our Constitution, an economic impact -- not to mention the diplomatic and the logistical challenges that this agenda will have on our nation,\" she told ABC News.\n\nThe National Immigration Law Center challenged previous Trump policies, like those that resulted in family separation at the border and efforts to ban immigrants from Muslim countries and to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). Matos said their team has been strategizing since the start of the year in anticipation of a \"possible Trump 2.0\" to challenge any mass deportation plan he may try to enact.\n\nThe last time there was a mass deportation of migrants in the U.S. was in the 1950s under President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who expelled roughly 1 million Mexican undocumented immigrants, many of whom were temporary or seasonal workers, on trains, buses and cargo ships. Trump has pointed to Eisenhower's aggressive actions -- dubbed at the time using the slur \"Operation Wetback\" and later criticized as inhumane -- as a model for his pledge.\n\nGroups of migrants of different nationalities arrive at the Rio Grande, to cross it and surrender to the American authorities in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico on Feb. 19, 2024. Christian Torres/Anadolu via Getty Images\n\nBut in addition to legal roadblocks, any mass removal effort would face huge logistical hurdles: limited detention space, thousands of enforcement personnel needed and heavy case backlogs.\n\n\"The overall capacity is nowhere near what would be necessary to carry out the plans as they've been detailed today,\" said Jorge Loweree, the managing director of programs and strategy at the American Immigration Council.\n\n\"I think people just do not understand how labor intensive this process is, especially in a country of our size and a country of our diversity,\" said Muzaffar Chishti, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute. \"That it's almost impossible to spot an unauthorized worker in the mixed communities that we have and that it takes a lot of personnel resources even to execute a warrant against a single person.\"\n\n\"So given all those constraints, people will soon understand that's easier said than done,\" Chishti said. \"It's clearly used for political purposes and we may not hear it again after the election.\"\n\nPeople hold signs and flags at a \"close the border\" rally in Boston, MA, May 4, 2024. Joseph Prezioso/AFP via Getty Images\n\nIn fact, Trump similarly pledged a mass deportation of undocumented migrants during his 2016 campaign and it was never carried out.\n\nThis cycle, Trump has ratcheted up his rhetoric against immigrants. He's gone so far as to suggest migrants are \"poisoning the blood of our country\" and, without evidence, to claim they are largely coming from \"prisons, jails, mental institutions, from insane asylums.\" In addition to mass deportations, he's also suggested ending birthright citizenship (a right to citizenship for children born in the U.S. to parents living in the country illegally that is currently guaranteed by the 14th Amendment) and reimposing travel bans.\n\nSome observers worry Trump would go further in executing his anti-immigrant agenda if granted another four years as commander in chief.\n\nTrump's vowed to expand executive authority and install public servants loyal to him and his vision. And while the courts were a major backstop during his first administration, Trump reshaped the federal judiciary by appointing hundreds of judges and several Supreme Court justices.\n\nPlus, it appears he now has more buy-in from Republicans on Capitol Hill. Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican who was once a champion of immigration reform, recently reversed his stance to support Trump's deportation plan.\n\n\"I think they learned some hard lessons in the first term about the agencies and about the courts, and how some of their schemes can be slow walked,\" Leopold said of Trump's team. \"So, I think they will be going into the second term with a lot more knowledge and how to actually run the government and implement their plans.\"",

The former defense secretary spoke at a special event at DefenseTalks, presented by DefenseScoop . He said he believes the nation\u2019s election systems are perhaps the most secure they\u2019ve ever been against cyberattacks .",
        "text": "Gen. Mattis on foreign influence operations: The US has never been \u2018more vulnerable\u2019\nA former defense secretary gave a stark warning Wednesday about how vulnerable he believes the nation is to foreign influence amid the upcoming 2024 election cycle.\n\nRetired Gen. Jim Mattis said during a special appearance at DefenseTalks, presented by DefenseScoop, that while election systems and voting infrastructure are perhaps the most secure they\u2019ve ever been against cyberattacks, \u201cthe bigger problem and the one that I think that we are very vulnerable to right now is the influence operations.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to influence operations, I think I\u2019ve never seen the country more vulnerable and a more lucrative place for the enemy to go after than right now,\u201d Mattis, who led the Pentagon during the early part of the Trump administration, said in an on-stage interview.\n\nMattis pointed out that this isn\u2019t a secret, with evidence of Russia and China in particular revving up their \u201cpropaganda machines,\u201d not only targeting the U.S. but other democracies like France and Germany as well, with disinformation. And increasingly those adversaries are using advanced tech, like artificial intelligence, to boost those influence ops.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd yet, because of the divisive state of U.S. politics and culture going into the 2024 election, \u201cwe\u2019re going to have people who are trying to increase the tribalism, increase the distrust between Americans. And right now with the level of ideological disarray in our country, in Beijing and Moscow, the leaders are cheering us on as we tear each other down and we use scorching rhetoric,\u201d he said, adding that they will \u201ctake it to the limit of what they can do to make distrust between you.\u201d\n\nThat said, Mattis has great confidence in the cybersecurity of the nation\u2019s election infrastructure, saying he believes there\u2019s a \u201c99.9% chance\u201d there won\u2019t be actual meddling in the voting systems and that vote counts will be accurate.\n\nMattis also touched on the evolving domain of cyber within the U.S. military. While he wasn\u2019t a fan of an idea that\u2019s growing in popularity to split cyber out from the services and create a new, independent military branch to support it, he did call for the nation\u2019s leaders to find a model that would give the Department of Defense and U.S. Cyber Command a bigger role in the case of a cyberattack on the homeland and its critical infrastructure.\n\nBeyond that, he also talked down the notion that recent advances in technology have dramatically shifted the nature of defense and warfare, saying \u201cthe fundamental nature of warfare has not yet changed in the last 10,000 years.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe promise of these technologies is just enormous right now. And I\u2019m no Luddite, I want the highest tech, the most reliable technology in the world,\u201d Mattis said. However, he contended that \u201chistory would tell you that technology has not delivered ever with the promise it seems to, except perhaps with the nuclear weapons at the end of World War II.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat said, he warned: \u201cYou have to stay alert with artificial intelligence and machine learning \u2014 that could actually change\u201d things in big ways, though that remains to be seen.\n\nUltimately, regardless of the technology at hand \u2014 whether that\u2019s the use of tanks in World War II or drones in today\u2019s conflicts \u2014 the most important element is integration, Mattis said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to look at technology as one tool in the toolbox. Take full advantage of it, but make certain you\u2019re integrating it right. And that has to do with innovation, it has to do with the thinking, the education of the officers and NCOs in your military,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot that goes into something like that, not just about technology alone.\u201d",

        "text": "The Increasing Trumpification of TikTok\nDonald Trump isn\u2019t on TikTok.\n\nAnd he may not need to be, as his allies and surrogates transform it in his favor. The social-media platform, though still regarded as a hub for Democratic voices and liberal causes, has seen an uptick of right-wing, pro-Trump influencers since the last presidential election.\n\nThe increase comes as President Biden signed legislation that would force a sale of TikTok by its Chinese owner or would have it banned in the U.S. That law has triggered a backlash from young voters who backed Mr. Biden overwhelmingly in 2020, some of whom are also opposing his administration\u2019s support of Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. An internal analysis within TikTok found nearly twice as many pro-Trump posts as pro-Biden ones on the platform since November: 1.29 million pro-Trump posts versus 651,000 pro-Biden posts.\n\n\u201cIf we allow the Democrats and the leftist organizations and leftist influencers to have a monopoly on the content that\u2019s produced on TikTok, we will lose the next generation of Americans,\u201d said C.J. Pearson, a social-media influencer with nearly 149,000 followers on TikTok who co-chairs the Republican National Committee\u2019s youth advisory council.\n\nBut TikTok still presents challenges as the former president seeks to regain the White House.\n\nAmong the right, TikTok\u2019s reach remains overshadowed by that of other social media platforms. Although a super PAC backing Mr. Trump joined TikTok this month, it remains unclear whether his unpopularity with young voters, who are on the platform in large numbers, will make it difficult for him to find widespread support. And Republican politicians \u2014 including Mr. Trump \u2014 have largely resisted joining the platform, with many having vocally opposed it.",

        "text": "As Trump campaigns, he's spreading QAnon posts anew. Some call that 'playing with fire'\nAs Donald Trump heads toward a November rematch election against President Joe Biden, his online posts are reinvigorating a key element of his support from years past: the conspiracy theory known as QAnon.\n\nWhile QAnon largely faded from the spotlight after Trump left office, he has newly amplified the ideas on his social media platform, Truth Social.\n\nSince the site launched two years ago, Trump has reposted or promoted QAnon-affiliated accounts more than 800 times, ensuring their messages will be widely seen, according to a new study from liberal watchdog group Media Matters shared exclusively with USA TODAY.\n\nExperts say the support amounts to a tacit endorsement of a dangerous movement that has been linked to criminal acts ranging from the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot to isolated cases of violence and even murder.\n\nThe Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment about QAnon. While he was president, Trump spoke favorably of the movement and today he encourages QAnon chants and plays a song associated with QAnon at rallies.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s almost to be expected that \u2013 especially with the polling being close \u2013 that the Trump campaign is going to be back to its old tricks of trying to \u2026 cater to some of the conservative movement\u2019s fringes,\u201d said Jared Holt, senior research analyst at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue.\n\nBut amplifying QAnon is dangerous, Holt said, especially at a moment when the nation is already so polarized. \u201cIt\u2019s playing with fire,\u201d he said.\n\nQAnon began as a set of anonymous posts on fringe online message boards. A user or users, identifying themselves as a mysterious whistleblower called Q, claimed to work inside the Trump administration.\n\nThe posts alleged world affairs were controlled by a vast conspiracy of Democrats \u2013 who also worshiped Satan and abused children \u2013 and that Trump was part of a secret plan to vanquish them. Mass arrests, known by followers as \u201cThe Storm,\u201d were coming at any moment.\n\nNo evidence ever emerged to support any of these beliefs. But the idea of Q, and key catchphrases from Q\u2019s posts, became elements of popular culture in a world captivated by the daily dramas of the Trump campaign and administration.\n\nQAnon banners and T-shirts made frequent appearances at Trump\u2019s rallies. And after the country voted Trump out of office, rioters carried QAnon banners into the Capitol as they tried to prevent the certification of the election.\n\nMainstream audiences heard less about Q after Trump left the White House and was banned from the platform then known as Twitter. QAnon-affiliated accounts were also banned wholesale from several major social media platforms. But the beliefs, which had always been so sprawling they could fold in nearly any conspiracy theory, never went away.\n\nNow Trump's string of reposts may be driving renewed interest as an election that could put him back into the White House moves closer, experts told USA TODAY.\n\nOne key QAnon slogan has been \u201cWhere we go one, we go all\u201d (or \u201cWWG1WGA\u201d for short). Another is \u201cNothing can stop what is coming\u201d (or \u201cNCSWIC\u201d for short), referring to the idea that Trump will eventually expose the conspirators. Media Matters found Trump\u2019s more recent posts shared these phrases with his 7 million followers on Truth.\n\nThe recent barrage of posts should be alarming to everyone, said Logan Strain, who started tracking QAnon as an amateur online researcher in 2018, and has become a widely quoted writer and expert on the subject. Under the pseudonym Travis View, he co-hosts the podcast \u201cQAnon Anonymous,\u201d which has spent years examining the long-term effects of the conspiracy theory and interviewing people who study it.\n\n\u201cWe should find it outrageous that there is a presidential candidate, who is leading the polls, who is actively, consciously encouraging an extremist movement that is responsible for real-world violence and the destruction of the personal lives of the people who believe in it,\u201d Strain said.\n\nQAnon beliefs have torn families apart\n\nAJ Rose, 44, knows firsthand just how powerful and pervasive the QAnon conspiracy theory still is in communities across the country.\n\nIn East Tennessee, she says she\u2019s surrounded by QAnon followers who are deeply distrustful of the government and blindly put their faith in the former president. QAnon duped two of her family members.\n\n\u201cA lot of people trust Trump based on the fact that he was the president at one time, so his words carry a lot of weight and, unfortunately, those are some pretty dangerous words,\u201d Rose said. \u201cThe government has turned its back on people who are impoverished, people who have health problems, people who have mental health problems, physical problems. So if you hear somebody say, \u2018I hate the government, too. Look at what it\u2019s doing to me. It\u2019s coming after me. But I\u2019m going to fix it.\u2019 That QAnon magnet is very strong.\u201d\n\nHow QAnon radicalized AmericansDark forces raged during the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2020 election\n\nSo strong, in fact, that it ensnared her 67-year-old mother, Anita Rose, a widow, Republican and retired journalist. After a sudden death in the family made her emotionally vulnerable, Rose became a follower of Trump, then QAnon.\n\nAnita Rose was grieving and looking for answers, her daughter says. She thought Trump was the nation\u2019s salvation. It didn\u2019t help that Trump and QAnon had already gained a forceful grip over Anita Rose\u2019s elderly father, a military veteran who was exposed to Agent Orange during the Vietnam War.\n\nAnita Rose says she became convinced that Trump was defending the country against a ring of pedophiles. Her daughter helped her see the truth. \u201cI don\u2019t believe he is doing that anymore,\u201d she said.\n\nAJ Rose knew she got through to her mom when the picture of Trump praying in front of the American flag disappeared from the refrigerator.\n\n\u201cA lot of terrible things have come out of QAnon,\u201d Rose said. She ticked off examples including the Capitol attack and Pizzagate \u2013 in which unfounded claims that Democrats were running a child sex trafficking ring out of a Washington pizza parlor led to a man storming the restaurant with an assault rifle.\n\n\u201cI am racking my brain trying to think of something good that has come from QAnon but there really isn\u2019t anything. It hasn\u2019t brought our country together or helped families or spread good information people need to know about health. It has not done any of that. But it is hurting.\u201d\n\nPainful stories of QAnon tearing apart families abound.\n\nMike Rothschild, author of the 2021 book, \u201cThe Storm is Upon Us: How QAnon Became a Movement, Cult, and Conspiracy Theory of Everything,\u201d says American families pay a high price when their loved ones are radicalized.\n\n\u201cThere are people who have ruined their families, ruined their lives, lost their jobs, and wound up in prison because they're enmeshed in this ecosystem,\u201d Rothschild said. \u201cA lot of these people are really in pain and looking for some kind of explanation for why the world is the way it is \u2013 they just found it in the wrong place.\u201d\n\nQAnon fostered loyal Trump following\n\nDuring Trump's presidency, QAnon supporters wore \"Q\" paraphernalia to his rallies and held large \"Q\" signs. Seizing on a loyal constituency, Trump and his campaign began courting QAnon followers even after the FBI identified QAnon as a fringe conspiracy theory very likely to motivate \u201csome domestic extremists to commit criminal, sometimes violent activity.\u201d\n\nSeveral people have even cited QAnon as the rationale for seemingly inexplicable murder cases. A California QAnon believer and surf instructor shot and killed his two young children with a speargun in 2021, telling authorities he had been enlightened by QAnon and that he needed to kill his children to prevent them from growing into monsters. In 2022, a Michigan man \u2013 whose daughter said he had fallen down a \u201crabbit hole\u201d of QAnon conspiracy theories \u2013 shot his family, killing his wife and gravely injuring his daughters.\n\nMore often, QAnon has led to politically motivated acts, especially crimes committed during the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021. Some rioters carried QAnon banners during the Capitol attack, and dozens of people arrested for their roles in the Jan. 6 insurrection were obsessed with the conspiracy theory.\n\nQAnon followers have lit wildfires, vandalized monuments and buildings and been arrested with bombs and weapons. Believers have launched cults and been charged with attempted coups. The conspiracy theory has inspired extremist movements as far away as Japan and Germany.\n\nAt the same time, QAnon researchers say, the conspiracy theory has always provided a perfect pool of supporters for the former president.\n\nIn earlier years, Trump amplified accounts that promoted QAnon hundreds of times on the social media site then known as Twitter, until he was banned from the service for two years.\n\nSince his reinstatement on the site now called X, Trump has not posted about Q, instead using his own social media platform to amplify the conspiracy theory.\n\nTrump has declined to disavow or condemn QAnon. When asked in public settings, he has said he isn\u2019t really aware of the movement but praised QAnon followers for supporting him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard these are people that love our country,\u201d he said at a White House press briefing in August 2020. \u201cI don\u2019t really know anything about it, except that they do supposedly like me.\u201d\n\nTold that QAnon supporters believe Satan-worshiping, pedophile Democrats control the \u201cDeep State,\u201d and only Trump could vanquish them, he responded, \u201cI haven\u2019t heard that, but is that supposed to be a bad thing or a good thing? If I can help save the world from problems, I\u2019m willing to do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump is the star player in the QAnon show,\u201d said Megan Squire, deputy managing editor of the Southern Poverty Law Center\u2019s Intelligence Project. \u201cHe loves anybody that's a fan of him \u2013 that\u2019s always been the case.\u201d\n\nQAnon finds new reach on Truth Social\n\nOn Truth Social, a heavily partisan platform owned by Trump Media & Technology Group, Trump\u2019s namesake social media company in which he owns a majority stake, QAnon is only a click or a tap away.\n\nKash Patel, a Trump adviser and board director at Truth Social\u2019s parent company, said in 2022 on a right-wing video webcast that the site was intentionally incorporating QAnon messages \u201cto capture audiences.\u201d\n\nQAnon-affiliated accounts there brag about how many times Trump has \u201cre-truthed\u201d them, as shares are called. Hashtags herald \u201cThe Great Awakening,\u201d when Democrats are arrested and Trump seizes a second term in office.\n\nIn September 2022, Trump shared an image of himself wearing a Q-shaped lapel pin along with the phrase: \u201cThe storm is coming,\u201d a QAnon catchphrase for the period of unrest preceding the Great Awakening when Trump triumphs over the forces of evil in a final battle.\n\nOver the last year, Trump has amplified QAnon-affiliated accounts on Truth Social nearly 350 times.\n\nOne post linked to a Rumble video that showed QAnon content. Trump commented: \u201cIncredible video!\u201d Another said, \u201cDo it, Q!\u201d\n\nMedia Matters identified Truth Social accounts as promoting QAnon if it found they shared slogans, posts described as being from \u201cQ\u201d or imagery related to QAnon.\n\nTruth Social has welcomed QAnon influencers, said Alex Kaplan, a senior researcher at Media Matters who compiled the report.\n\n\u201cIn the early months, Truth Social was really boosting these accounts, including one just called \u2018Q,\u2019\u201d Kaplan said. \u201cThey were playing footsie with Q from the start.\u201d",

        "text": "Texas Man Sentenced to Prison for Actions During Jan. 6 Capitol Breach\nWASHINGTON\u2014A Texas man was sentenced to prison today after he was convicted of multiple felony and misdemeanor charges related to his conduct during the Jan. 6, 2021, breach of the U.S. Capitol. His actions and those of others disrupted a joint session of the U.S. Congress convened to ascertain and count the electoral votes related to the 2020 presidential election.\n\nAlex Kirk Harkrider, 36, of Carthage, Texas, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth to 24 months in prison, 24 months of supervised release, and ordered to pay $2,000 in restitution.\n\nHarkrider was convicted of felony charges of civil disorder, obstruction of an official proceeding, entering and remaining in a restricted building or grounds with a deadly or dangerous weapon, and disorderly and disruptive conduct in a restricted building or grounds with a deadly or dangerous weapon on Jan. 2, 2024, following a stipulated bench trial before Judge Lamberth. In addition to the felonies, Harkrider was also found guilty of misdemeanor charges of theft of government property, disorderly conduct in a Capitol building, and parading, demonstrating, or picketing in a Capitol building.\n\nAccording to the stipulated facts, Harkrider traveled from his home in Texas to Washington, D.C., with his friend and co-defendant, Ryan Nichols, based on their belief that the 2020 presidential election was fraudulent. Harkrider and Nichols exchanged text messages in the preceding days, planning and organizing for the trip. In one message, Nichols sent Harkrider a photograph of body armor and pricing, stating that the body armor would protect against various bullets. In another series of messages to Harkrider, Nichols stated, \u201cDad and I are building a gun container in the truck today. Just know I have intel that Washington will be a warzone. Big possibility that actual battle goes down.\u201d\n\nCourt documents say that Harkrider and Nichols each brought two firearms with them on their trip, transporting them in the box built for Nichols\u2019 truck. On the night of Jan. 5, 2021, Harkrider and Nichols attended a rally on the streets of Washington, D.C.\n\nOn Jan. 6, 2021, Harkrider and Nichols attended the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally at the Ellipse and then marched toward the U.S. Capitol building. Harkrider and Nichols both wore body armor. Harkrider was armed with a tactical tomahawk axe. The two joined a large crowd of rioters that had gathered in front of an arched entrance to the Lower West Terrace doors, also known as the Tunnel. This was the site of some of the most violent assaults on law enforcement officers on January 6th. Rioters at the Tunnel battled officers for hours as they attempted to storm the Capitol building.\n\nAt approximately 3:56 p.m., Harkrider and Nichols pushed with the crowd against law enforcement officers in the Tunnel in synchronized movements. Harkrider then took hold of a red canister, held it above his head for more than ten seconds, and passed it to other members of the crowd. The canister was identified as a stolen police canister of O.C. spray. Harkrider and Nichols then continued to push with the crowd against the officers, rocking back and forth as the crowd chanted, \u201cHeave! Ho!\u201d\n\nAt about 4:13 p.m., Nichols observed another rioter attempting to break a window to the Capitol with a stolen canister of police pepper spray. Nichols and Harkrider then entered the Capitol through a broken window, specifically entering Room ST-2M. Before entering the Capitol, Harkrider pumped his fist in the air. Harkrider and Nichols then emerged from the room and stood on a window ledge. From the ledge, Nichols, using a bullhorn, shouted to other rioters, \u201cGet in the building, this is your country, get in the building, we will not be told \u2018No\u2019,\u201d \u201cThis is the second revolution,\u201d \u201cThis is not a peaceful protest,\u201d and \u201cIf you have a weapon, you need to get your weapon!\u201d\n\nHarkrider and Nichols exited the Capitol building at about 4:35 p.m. As he was leaving, Harkrider picked up a broken piece of government furniture from the Capitol and took it to his home in Texas. Authorities later recovered the stolen item during the execution of a search warrant.\n\nThe FBI arrested Harkrider on Jan. 18, 2021, in Texas.\n\nNichols was sentenced to 63 months in prison on May 2, 2024, for his role in the events of January 6th.\n\nThis case was prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Columbia and the Department of Justice National Security Division\u2019s Counterterrorism Section. Valuable assistance was provided by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of Texas.\n\nThis case was investigated by the FBI\u2019s Dallas and Washington Field Offices. Valuable assistance was provided by the Metropolitan Police Department and the U.S. Capitol Police.\n\nIn the 40 months since Jan. 6, 2021, more than 1,424 individuals have been charged in nearly all 50 states for crimes related to the breach of the U.S. Capitol, including more than 500 individuals charged with assaulting or impeding law enforcement, a felony. The investigation remains ongoing.\n\nAnyone with tips can call 1-800-CALL-FBI (800-225-5324) or visit tips.fbi.gov.",

        "text": "Donald Trump or Joe Biden? US stock market expert predicts presidential poll's surprising result basis indices movement\nSo who's winning US election, scheduled for 5 November 2024? On the back of a stiff neck on neck competition between Joe Biden and Donald Trump stock market has proven to be a reliable indicator in the past. Economist survey: Trump has a 45% chance of winning the poll as compared to Biden who holds a 44% chance to win.(AFP)\n\nRecent surveys of prominent prediction markets have shown a wide range of probabilities regarding President Joe Biden's chances of winning re-election, fluctuating from below 38% to as high as 76%.\n\nAccording to an Economist survey, Trump has a 45% chance of winning the poll as compared to Biden who holds a 44% chance to win.\n\nMethodology of the poll prediction\n\nTo gain insight into alternative indicators, Mark Hulbert conducted an analysis encompassing various economic, financial, and sentiment measures. This analysis included the U.S. stock market, real GDP, the Conference Board\u2019s consumer-confidence index, and the University of Michigan\u2019s consumer-sentiment survey, focusing on their year-to-date changes leading up to Election Day.\n\nAmong these indicators, only the stock market demonstrated a significant correlation with the incumbent party's likelihood of victory, a correlation statistically significant at the 95% confidence level.\n\nAnalysis findings predict a Joe Biden victory\n\nHis findings show a clear relationship between the year-to-date performance of the stock market and the probabilities of the incumbent party retaining the presidency. He shows how historical data since the establishment of the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 1896 supports this correlation.\n\nBased on this historical correlation and the Dow's current year-to-date price-only gain of 5.6%, President Biden's chances of winning re-election stand at 58.8%. These odds will adjust accordingly if the stock market experiences further gains or losses leading up to Election Day.\n\nHulbert argues, even without the ambiguity of electronic prediction markets, it's challenging to argue that their track records surpass that of the stock market. Limited sample sizes hinder the ability to establish statistically significant patterns. For instance, the Iowa Electronic Markets (IEM), one of the oldest prediction instruments dating back to 1988, has only nine presidential elections in its track record.",

        "text": "America\u2019s Most Trusted News Anchors Are \u2026\n\u201cThe gatekeepers are gone,\u201d Colin Jost told a roomful of journalists at the White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner on April 27, before pivoting to the punchline: \u201cDid you know that 90 percent of people now get their news exclusively from social media? And that must be true because I saw it in a random guy\u2019s TikTok.\u201d\n\nFor those (ever fewer) media gatekeepers who have major reach, trust is currency. And there\u2019s still a halo effect for those TV stars with broadest viewership \u2014 i.e., network TV hosts \u2014 particularly evening and morning show anchors for NBC and ABC, a new THR/Morning Consult poll shows. The survey, conducted May 4-5 among a sample of 2,239 U.S. adults, asked opinions about 40-plus major TV news stars, as well as surveyed trends about America\u2019s fractured media diet during a presidential campaign year.\n\nAmong those several dozen high-profile names, Lester Holt, who has held the NBC Nightly News chair for nine years, has the highest share of respondents, 65 percent, saying they placed \u201ca lot\u201d or \u201csome\u201d trust in the anchor, leading the poll.\n\nEmma McIntyre/Getty Images; Mike Coppola/Getty Images; Cindy Ord/Getty Images\n\nHolt\u2019s reputation may precede him, as the last time THR partnered with decision intelligence firm Morning Consult on this media trust survey, in 2018 during the height of the Donald Trump presidency, the Nightly News anchor also claimed the most trusted distinction. And this time he improved his stature by a couple of percentage points.\n\nElsewhere on the broadcast evening desk, ABC\u2019s World News Tonight anchor David Muir (63 percent) is the runner-up, while CBS Evening News anchor Norah O\u2019Donnell sits at 53 percent on that \u201ca lot\u201d or \u201csome\u201d trust measure.\n\nDimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images; Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images; Cindy Ord/Getty Images; Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images; Paul Morigi/Getty Images\n\nAmong the morning show personalities included in the survey, ABC\u2019s Good Morning America anchor Robin Roberts (64 percent) and NBC\u2019s Today staple Al Roker (64 percent) led the way. As a side note: 52 percent of respondents in the survey say it\u2019s \u201cvery\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d important that the outlet where they get their political news is also \u201centertaining,\u201d which could be a bonus for both daytime talkers as well as late night shows.\n\nDimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images; Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images; Hannity: Terry Wyatt/Getty Images\n\nOn cable news, CNN\u2019s Who\u2019s Talking to \u2026 host Chris Wallace and Anderson Cooper (also a broadcast staple on CBS\u2019 60 Minutes) both saw 60 percent of respondents say they have \u201ca lot\u201d or \u201csome\u201d trust in them. Cooper also saw an increase of several percentage points in overall trust since the 2018 survey was taken.\n\nGiven the highly polarized audiences of the Big 3 cable nets, it\u2019s worth noting: 58 percent of respondents who identify as Joe Biden voters in 2020 say they \u201ctend to consume news from a wide variety of sources,\u201d which is about 6 percentage points higher than self-identified Donald Trump 2020 voters. (More on the survey methodology here.)\n\nDave Kotinsky/Getty Images; Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images; Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images; Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nLeading the most divisive names in TV news is Tucker Carlson, the ousted Fox News anchor who now posts on X and his own site. He has the highest share of respondents, 49 percent, saying they trust the anchor \u201cnot much\u201d or \u201cnot at all.\u201d Also polarizing, by that measure: Fox News anchor Sean Hannity (45 percent), former Fox and NBC personality Megyn Kelly (40 percent), Fox News host Laura Ingraham (38 percent), former CNN host Don Lemon (35 percent) and MSNBC host Joy Reid (35 percent).\n\nA few stats that speak to the echo chamber of 2024 political news: 40 percent of those surveyed \u201cstopped watching a news program\u201d because they \u201cdisagreed with a political view presented.\u201d Of the 18-34 age group, that figure is higher, at 46 percent in the poll.\n\nAnd 20 percent of respondents say it\u2019s \u201cvery important\u201d when deciding where to get political news to choose an outlet that \u201cpresents views that are similar to mine.\u201d Hence, Fox News and MSNBC typically lead the way in linear TV total audience ratings versus CNN (although CNN will point out that it boasts higher monthly unique visitors online than its rivals).\n\nOlivier Douliery-Pool/Getty Images; Rob Kim/Getty Images; Roy Rochlin/Getty Images\n\nIf parsing the data looking strictly at who is the most trusted on each major cable network, these names arrive at the top: MSNBC\u2019s most trusted name is veteran Ali Velshi (55 percent, four points higher than Rachel Maddow), anchor Harris Faulkner (53 percent) led for Fox News and the aforementioned Wallace (formerly of Fox) earned the distinction for his CNN interview show.\n\nJamie McCarthy/Getty Images\n\nHow did Jon Stewart, now back in the chair at The Daily Show, compare with other late night hosts who also fit in the newsmaker mold? CBS\u2019 Late Show host Stephen Colbert had the same \u201ca lot / some\u201d trust score (57 percent) but had a slightly higher negative score (29 percent), while NBC\u2019s Late Night host Seth Meyers had a 49 percent trust score and 27 percent of respondents saying they had \u201cnot much\u201d or \u201cnot at all\u201d trust in him.\n\nIs it a surprise that network news is perceived as more trustworthy than cable news? Maybe not given the Big 3 cable news networks are more associated with partisanship. It may be beside the point: About 39 percent of respondents say they get their political news from social media daily \u2014 it\u2019s a higher percentage than all other traditional news types (network news, cable, radio, online sites, newspapers).\n\nHow Much Do You Trust \u2026\n\nWhat about the rest of the TV news names? Here\u2019s a network-by-network, personality-by-personality look at the survey, ranked by the highest combined \u201ca lot / some\u201d score and, if there\u2019s a tie, factoring in the \u201cnot

        "text": "Misinformation Swirled During Taiwan's 2024 Elections\nBody\n\nWith more than 70 countries hosting national elections, 2024 is the biggest election year in history, according to The Economist.\n\nBut how misinformation impacts elections, especially with the rise in content generated by artificial intelligence, continues to be of concern.\n\nA research team examined misinformation narratives on social media in 2023 regarding the Taiwanese presidential election on January 13, 2024. They were especially interested in how narratives targeted relations between Taiwan and the United States.\n\nMisinformation targeted mistrust and skepticism toward the U.S. rather than U.S. foreign policy directly, according to the study, which was published in the Harvard Kennedy School Misinformation Review.\n\n\n\nTo examine misinformation across three platforms: Line\u2014the most popular messaging app in Taiwan; PTT\u2014the Taiwanese equivalent of Reddit; and Facebook, the researchers applied large language models\u2014AI algorithms like ChatGPT that can understand and generate text and other content.\n\nWhen Line users come across content that may be dubious, they have the option to forward it to the Cofacts chatbot, a third-party, crowd-sourced platform in which content is fact-checked by volunteers.\n\nOf the 140,300 Line posts relating to the Taiwanese election, which were fact-checked by Cofacts and analyzed by the researchers, nearly 11,000 posts focused on issues relating to Taiwan, the U.S., and China, making it the most prominent fact-checked topic.\n\nThe study found that misinformation toward the U.S. contained various narratives, such as the U.S. and the threat of war, especially regarding Ukraine; economic decline due to fiscal actions by the U.S.; and the vaccine supply and the U.S.\n\nFor example, some posts suggested that the U.S. deliberately limited the COVID-19 vaccine supply during the pandemic while others stated that U.S. vaccine doses were cheaper domestically than what Taiwan had to pay.\n\nThis misinformation may have been planted on social media to damage the United States\u2019 reputation and credibility and \u201clower the Taiwanese audience\u2019s belief that the U.S. will help,\u201d according to the researchers, as prior research has provided evidence of such actions.\n\nThe team found that much of the misinformation on U.S.-Taiwan relations circulated most prominently within China-friendly political groups and referenced U.S.-based conspiracy groups.\n\n\u201cMore than half of the misinformation content on the U.S. relating to Taiwan\u2019s recent presidential election in our datasets was multimodal,\u201d says lead author Herbert Chang \u201918, an assistant professor of quantitative social science at Dartmouth. \u201cWith so much visual content, our results contribute to the literature and concerns about the impact of AI-generated content on elections.\u201d\n\nBy tracking misinformation activity and the location of where the content was posted, the data showed that some users in China and other areas in Asia deliberately masked their geolocations by using virtual private networks to make it look like they were based in the U.S., when in fact that was not the case.\n\nTaiwan\u2019s politics have typically been marked by two parties, the Nationalist Party led by Kuomintang, or KMT, and known as the blue camp, which reflects a more pro-integration sentiment towards China, and the Democratic Progressive Party, known as the green camp, which has wanted to change the country\u2019s name from the Republic of China to Taiwan and modify the constitution. A third party, the Taiwan\u2019s People\u2019s Party, emerged in 2020 with a call for greater attention to domestic and social issues and less emphasis on foreign relations. The analysis builds on research studying social media discourse and support for the presidential candidates, published in PNAS Nexus earlier this year.\n\nLai Ching-te of the DPP was inaugurated on May 20 as Taiwan\u2019s president, as the DPP won the election for a third consecutive presidency with 40% of the votes. The KMT received 33% of the votes and the TPP received 26% with strong support among 20-somethings.\n\n\u201cThis election not only demonstrates the increased importance of international relations in voter choice around the world, at a time of heightened geopolitical conflict, but also how AI can be used to identify and fight misinformation, not just create it,\u201d says Chang.\n\nAustin Wang at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and Yu (Sunny) Fang at Barnard College also served as co-authors of the study.",

        "text": "Are Russia and North Korea planning an 'October surprise' that aids Trump?\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Biden administration is increasingly concerned that the intensifying military alliance between Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un could vastly expand Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear capabilities and increase tensions in the Asia-Pacific region, six senior U.S. officials told NBC News.\n\nU.S. officials are also bracing for North Korea to potentially take its most provocative military actions in a decade close to the U.S. presidential election, possibly at Putin\u2019s urging, the officials said.\n\nThe timing, they said, could be designed to create turmoil in yet another part of the world as Americans decide whether to send President Joe Biden or former President Donald Trump back to the White House.\n\n\u201cWe have no doubt that North Korea will be provocative this year. It\u2019s just a matter of how escalatory it is,\u201d a U.S. intelligence official said.\n\nThe first test firing of the North Korean Hwasongpho-16B, a new type of intermediate-range fueled ballistic missile, on April 2. KCNA / AFP - Getty Images file\n\nU.S. intelligence officials accused Russia of interfering in the 2016 election to help elect Trump. The Biden administration had tense relations with Russia, which collapsed after it invaded Ukraine in 2022.\n\nAfter the publication of this story, Steven Cheung, a Trump campaign spokesman, said \u201cthe only \u2018October surprise\u2019 will be the look of shock\u201d among reporters when Trump wins re-election.\n\nWith Putin expected to visit North Korea to meet with Kim in the coming weeks, U.S. officials expect them to solidify a new deal to expand transfers of military technology to Pyongyang.\n\n\u201c2024 is not going to be a good year,\u201d said Victor Cha, senior vice president for Asia and Korea chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a bit of a roller coaster.\u201d\n\nA burgeoning alliance\n\nU.S. intelligence officials believe Putin is providing North Korea with nuclear submarine and ballistic missile technology in exchange for Pyongyang\u2019s sending Russia large amount of munitions for its war in Ukraine, the senior U.S. officials said. North Korea provides Russia with more munitions than Europe provides to Ukraine, including millions of artillery shells.\n\nOfficials are also concerned that Russia might help North Korea complete the final steps needed to field its first submarine able to launch a nuclear-armed missile.\n\nIn September, North Korea unveiled a submarine, based on an old Soviet model, but U.S. officials said Pyongyang was most likely exaggerating its capabilities. They said the submarine still needed additional technology before it could deploy or launch a nuclear-armed missile.\n\nDespite repeatedly offering to begin talks without any conditions, the U.S. has had no significant dialogue with the Kim regime for three years, the officials said. The administration reached out to North Korea again this year, but it did not respond.\n\nA Russian artillery unit fires a D-30 howitzer toward Ukrainian positions on Jan. 26, 2023. RIA Novosti / Sputnik via AP\n\nU.S. officials said they do not have an entirely clear understanding of the types of technology Russia is supplying North Korea. Unlike weapons transfers that can be physically tracked, sharing of military technology is not as easily detected.\n\n\u201cThe higher-end Russia technical assistance comes in forms that are very difficult indeed to monitor,\u201d a senior administration official said.\n\nU.S. officials cautioned that the North Korean ammunition is most likely old and unreliable. But North Korea sent the artillery at a time when Ukraine was struggling with stockpiles and had to ration ammunition, so the influx gave Russia an advantage on the battlefield.\n\nThe officials said that in exchange for the ammunition it is providing Moscow, North Korea wants Russia to provide it with ballistic missile parts, aircraft, missiles, armored vehicles and other advanced technologies.\n\nIn recent months North Korea has continued to advance its missile program, including testing a solid-fuel engine for a hypersonic missile and other incremental advances that together have made its missile program more reliable, U.S. officials warn.\n\nPyongyang has long sought a long-range ballistic missile able to fly thousands of miles and then re-enter the atmosphere with the payload intact. U.S. officials warn that Russia could now be helping it achieve the final steps. A nuclear-capable missile with survivable re-entry vehicles would present a significant challenge for U.S. missile defense systems.\n\nU.S. officials also said there has been increased activity at one of the North Korean nuclear test facilities, which could indicate preparations for another test. Satellite images published in April by Beyond Parallel, a project examining the Korean Peninsula at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, showed activity at Tunnel No. 3 at the Punggye-ri nuclear facility.\n\nThe group said that \u201cboth the United States and South Korea have assessed North Korea as having completed all the required preparations for conducting a seventh nuclear test from the tunnel.\u201d\n\nThe Biden administration has been expecting a nuclear test from North Korea for some time. The U.S. recently prepared contingency plans for how to respond if Kim takes aggressive actions in the demilitarized zone with South Korea or shells South Korea\u2019s border islands, which he has not done since 2010.\n\n\u201cWe are going to be ready and prepared,\u201d the senior administration official said, noting the administration\u2019s coordination with South Korea and Japan.\n\nU.S. officials said they are also concerned that Moscow could help North Korea with its domestic manufacturing of weapons and even create a defense industrial base partnership.\n\nAn 'October surprise'?\n\nWhether or not Putin encourages Kim to take provocative actions designed to create a so-called October surprise in the U.S. presidential election, a second senior administration official said Russia might hesitate to such a step. The official said China, which has also grown closer to Russia and helped Putin wage his war in Ukraine, typically does not want instability in the region.\n\nStill, U.S. officials concede there is much about the Russia-North Korea alliance \u2014 and where it could go from here \u2014 that they do not know. Increased tensions in the Asia-Pacific region would come after two wars have broken out since Biden took office: one in Ukraine and the other between Israel and Hamas.\n\nTrump has argued that both wars are a result of Biden\u2019s leadership and would not have happened were he in office. Biden White House officials vehemently dispute that claim.\n\nThe increasingly close relationship between Putin and Kim represents a major shift from when Russia worked with the U.S. in the past to try to rein in North Korea. Now, Moscow is using its veto power on the U.N. Security Council to give Pyongyang cover to evade sanctions enforcement measures intended to constrain its nuclear program.\n\n\u201cThis is an enormous shift,\u201d the second senior administration official said.",

        "text": "Congress eyes new online privacy bills ahead of 2024 elections\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The presidential election is a little more than five months away, but key Republicans and Democrats in Congress see a critical window to pass sweeping legislation to shield the online data of both children and adults from Big Tech companies.\n\n\u201cI believe that there\u2019s a moment here where, on behalf of the American people, Congress needs to act,\u201d House Energy and Commerce Committee Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., said in an interview on the steps of the Capitol.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a recognition, on behalf of protecting our kids online, in protecting all Americans, that we need to ensure that there are privacy rights in place \u2026 and that our identity is being protected online and that we\u2019re in control of our data,\" she said.\n\nThe Energy and Commerce subcommittee that oversees online data will take the first step in trying to advance the privacy legislation, holding a markup Thursday on the American Privacy Rights Act, broad legislation that includes privacy protections for kids and adults, as well as the Kids Online Safety Act.\n\nThe bills would head to the full Energy and Commerce Committee in June before possible votes on the House floor.\n\nMcMorris Rodgers, who is close to Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said Johnson has not committed to holding a floor vote on the privacy bill. But it\u2019s expected to have strong bipartisan support given that she worked on it for months with a fellow powerful Washington state lawmaker, Senate Commerce Committee Chair Maria Cantwell, a Democrat.\n\nListen to McMorris Rodgers\u2019 interview on the \"Chuck Toddcast\" here.\n\nA revised draft bill was announced this week to address critics\u2019 concerns.\n\nThe American Privacy Rights Act would create national consumer data privacy rights and set federal standards for securing people\u2019s data rather than have a patchwork of state laws. Among other things, the legislation would require companies to be clear about how they use people\u2019s data and \u201cgive consumers the right to access, correct, delete, and export their data,\u201d according to a bill summary. The bill would also limit how companies collect and use data and ban transferring certain data to third parties without consent.\n\nThe measure includes the bipartisan bill to protect kids' and teens' online data, known as COPPA 2.0.\n\n\u201cI see the American Privacy Rights Act as foundational to protecting kids online, foundational to protecting our individual identity online,\u201d McMorris Rodgers said.\n\nThe bipartisan privacy bill is gathering momentum just weeks after McMorris Rodgers and Cantwell reached a compromise on legislation that forces TikTok\u2019s Chinese owner, ByteDance, to sell the popular video-sharing app or face a ban in the U.S. President Joe Biden signed the TikTok bill into law as part of a larger national security package.\n\nPassing the privacy package would be a huge legislative win for McMorris Rodgers, who is retiring after nearly two decades in Congress. And some lawmakers believe the pair of chairwomen can build on their TikTok success, even though the election is in full swing and partisan attacks are flying on Capitol Hill and the campaign trail.\n\n\u201cI like them both; they\u2019re both really competent,\u201d said Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., a former House member who has worked with both on their respective committees.\n\n\u201cAn election year can be seen two ways: a reason not to [act] and a compelling reason to act. People care about their privacy; it\u2019s a huge issue, and they care about us standing up to tech to protect them,\u201d Welch added. \u201cSo I think it\u2019s good election-year politics for both parties.\u201d\n\nSen. Todd Young, R-Ind., another Commerce Committee member, said that he is still reviewing the bill but that he \u201cconceptually\u201d backs comprehensive national data privacy legislation.\n\n\u201cI think there may be a window of opportunity,\u201d Young said in an interview. \u201cThis obviously is a challenging issue, which is why it\u2019s taken a number of years, without resolution, to come up with a national standard.\n\n\"But I think between our continuing U.S.-China competition and the recent legislative successes we\u2019ve had on that front and the emergence of a veritable AI revolution,\" he said, \"those two things could create some renewed enthusiasm on this issue.\u201d\n\nDuring the push to reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration this month, Democrats and Republicans on the Senate Commerce Committee huddled on the chamber floor and discussed ways to move the privacy package forward, said Sen. Ben Ray Lujan, D-N.M., who took part in the talks.\n\n\u201cI believe there is room and there is momentum and support to get this done before the end of the calendar year,\u201d Lujan said.\n\nNot all House and Senate commerce committee members are on board yet. Ted Cruz of Texas, the top Republican on the Senate Commerce Committee, is reviewing the updated legislation; he pointed to his statement last month in response to a first draft bill revealed in April: \"I cannot support any data privacy bill that empowers trial lawyers, strengthens Big Tech by imposing crushing new regulatory costs on upstart competitors or gives unprecedented power to the FTC to become referees of internet speech and DEI compliance.\"\n\n\"DEI\" is the initialism for \"diversity, equity and inclusion\" measures.\n\nAnd Rep. Anna Eshoo, D-Calif., who represents parts of Silicon Valley, sent a memo to Cantwell detailing concerns about the April draft legislation. Eshoo does not want federal law to pre-empt stricter state privacy laws, like those in California. And in a post-Dobbs ruling world, in which the Supreme Court struck down the federal right to abortion, Eshoo wants to eliminate any potential loopholes in the legislation that could expose women\u2019s reproductive health data. Her team is still reviewing the new version of the bill.\n\n\u201cI scrubbed the draft, went through it, spoke to experts, and I sent it to the chair and ranking member, as well as any member that asked me what I thought,\u201d Eshoo said Wednesday.",

        "text": "US election: its impact on Europe\nUS election: its impact on Europe\n\nFri, 24th May 2024\n\nThe November 2024 US presidential election will be extremely close. Our forecast is a win for the Democratic incumbent, Joe Biden, but a victory for his Republican predecessor, Donald Trump, cannot be discounted.\n\nThe US is the EU\u2019s largest trade and investment partner, and European NATO members are reliant on US security guarantees, so the future of US trade and defence policy will be highly consequential for Europe.\n\nWe expect a hawkish approach to China regardless of who wins the election, putting pressure on the EU to align. On green policy, Mr Trump would row back on global goals, but with some upside risks for European firms.\n\nThe outlook for US security guarantees should Mr Trump retake the presidency is the issue causing the most consternation in Europe in the run-up to the US election. Mr Trump is often unpredictable, but his criticism of countries that do not meet NATO\u2019s target of defence spending amounting to 2% of GDP has been consistent. In recent comments he has taken his long-standing characterisation of these countries as \u201cfreeloaders\u201d to another level by suggesting that the US might not come to their aid in the event of a Russian invasion, as NATO\u2019s Article 5 requires. This has prompted much concern: in 2023, 20 of the 31 NATO members failed to meet the 2% spending target (although the countries bordering Russia, Belarus or Ukraine all did, bar Norway). Mr Trump has even floated the idea of the US withdrawing from NATO; however, this is highly unlikely, as it would need congressional approval.\n\nWhat we consider more likely from a Trump presidency is a spate of decisions aimed at putting severe pressure on European NATO members to step up their spending and become more autonomous in defence. This could include withdrawing from joint exercises, reducing the number of US troops on the ground, cutting relevant spending and continuing to sow doubts about the US\u2019s commitment to Article 5 of the alliance. In response, we would expect a more serious push in the EU towards boosting defence capabilities, including greater co-operation with the UK (where the defence spending target has recently been raised to 2.5% of GDP). Still, there are limitations to what could be achieved in the short to medium term given the degree of fragmentation in the current EU system, as well as bureaucratic and industrial bottlenecks. US military contractors stand to benefit most.\n\nUkraine\u2019s future in the balance\n\nThe most consequential security policy shift that we could expect from a Trump presidency concerns the level of US support for Ukraine. Under a Biden administration we would expect aid to be eroded to a level sufficient to stabilise the front lines, but not enough for Ukraine to regain the land currently occupied by Russia (about one-fifth of the country). Under Mr Trump uncertainty is high, but we would expect a sharper reduction in military and financial support in order to force Ukraine to the negotiating table to end the war quickly. The risk, depending on how this is handled, is that it could damage the credibility of the Western countries that had promised to back Ukraine, undermine Western security guarantees more generally and potentially embolden expansionist powers. Fear of Russian revisionism in the Baltic states and Moldova would spike in this scenario. NATO is already considering a plan to lock in \u20ac100bn of spending for Ukraine over five years.\n\nA potential shock to US-EU trade\n\nOn trade policy, we would expect Mr Biden, for the most part, to co-operate with allies and compete with rivals. Mr Trump, in contrast, would probably prefer to compete with everyone, while also being less predictable and more antagonistic than Mr Biden. This is significant because the two economies are highly integrated: the US is the EU\u2019s largest trade partner (buying a fifth of EU exports in 2023) and its largest investment destination. The US also ran trade deficits\u2014which Mr Trump abhors\u2014with 20 of the 27 EU member states last year. In this context, Mr Trump\u2019s threat to impose a blanket 10% tariff on all of the US\u2019s trading partners represents a major potential shock to the EU economy. Of course, such a course of action would face both legal and congressional hurdles, so its feasibility remains far from clear\u2014and even if implemented, the EU might be able to secure exemptions. In the worst-case scenario, if tariffs were imposed and the EU retaliated with tariffs on US goods, this would be highly inflationary, damaging growth in both economies.\n\nWe see three specific issues to watch on the US-EU trade policy front:\n\nUS tariffs on EU steel (at 25%) and aluminium (at 10%) are currently suspended until 2025. Mr Biden would probably keep these suspended as leverage in ongoing trade negotiations. Mr Trump would probably reimpose them immediately. This would exacerbate the EU\u2019s decline in global market share for such energy-intensive goods, after an initial hit when European gas prices spiked in 2022.\n\nare currently suspended until 2025.

This would exacerbate the EU\u2019s decline in global market share for such energy-intensive goods, after an initial hit when European gas prices spiked in 2022. US tariffs on automotive imports were a threat during Mr Trump\u2019s first presidency, and, although they were not imposed by the necessary deadline in 2019, could make a reappearance should he win a second term. EU carmakers would be vulnerable.\n\nwere a threat during Mr Trump\u2019s first presidency, and, although they were not imposed by the necessary deadline in 2019, could make a reappearance should he win a second term. EU carmakers would be vulnerable. Plans for digital services taxes (DSTs) are currently on hold during negotiations on the OECD\u2019s global tax deal. We expect that Mr Biden would keep the US involved in this, even though he might not finally endorse the treaty. In contrast, Mr Trump would probably exit the agreement\u2014prompting the suspended DSTs to be imposed. These would be most damaging for US tech firms, and could prompt a tit-for-tat trade war.\n\nIndustrial policy: green subsidies and China de-risking\n\nOn climate policy, a win for Mr Trump would mean a significant shift in the US stance. Mr Biden and Mr Trump have opposing views on climate change, with Mr Biden prioritising investment in green technologies and renewable energy in the almost US$400bn Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), while Mr Trump has promised to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, the international climate change treaty, and invest in fossil fuels. There would be upside risks for investment in Europe from Mr Trump\u2019s plans to slow down IRA subsidies for investments in renewable energies, batteries and electric vehicles (EVs), as these have been drawing investment away from European firms. However, the bigger picture is that for the EU, losing the US as an ally in the fight against climate change would be a severe hit, as this would be likely to jeopardise global efforts to avoid a tipping point in temperatures. It could also embolden those in the EU pushing for short-term economic interests to be prioritised over the green transition.\n\nOn China, both candidates agree (roughly speaking) on a hawkish position, with Mr Biden announcing 100% tariffs on Chinese EVs in May. Under either president, European countries will come under pressure to clarify and harden their positions on China, with the current disunity (Germany versus France, and Hungary versus the rest of the EU) creating friction in the US-EU relationship. The shape of this would vary, though, with Mr Biden pushing for a multilateral position (painful for Europe given its greater economic exposure to China), and Mr Trump\u2019s unilateral decision-making presenting unpredictable risks (such as Chinese goods flooding into the EU as a result of new tariffs on exports to the US). In particular, Mr Trump\u2019s threat to revoke China\u2019s \u201cmost-favoured nation\u201d status and raise tariffs on all Chinese goods by up to 60% would have major repercussions for Europe.\n\nWe see two specific issues to watch on the industrial policy front:\n\nThe EU\u2019s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) is now being phased in, with duties to be levied from 2026. For Mr Trump, this would be an automatic point of contention with the EU\u2014even though the US will not be much disadvantaged by this, as its production of the goods affected is not highly carbon-intensive. It might even benefit, with its exports being taxed less than emerging market equivalents.\n\nis now being phased in, with duties to be levied from 2026.

It might even benefit, with its exports being taxed less than emerging market equivalents. Co-operation on diversifying suppliers of critical minerals would continue under Mr Biden, probably through the EU-US Trade and Technology Council (TTC), where this has already begun. Under Mr Trump the TTC would probably not survive. However, shared US and EU progress on de-risking critical mineral supply chains away from China could potentially be achieved on a transactional rather than a co-operative basis.\n\nThe analysis and forecasts featured in this article are available in EIU\u2019s Country Analysis service.

        "text": "Arizona secretary of state calls threats to election officials \u2018domestic terrorism\u2019\nThe rising threats against US elections officials are a form of domestic terrorism, the secretary of state in the presidential campaign battleground state of Arizona has said.\n\n\u201cTerrorism is defined as a threat of violence for a political outcome,\u201d Adrian Fontes said in remarks recorded for an NBC Meet the Press episode airing on Sunday morning. \u201cThat\u2019s what this is, and \u2026 we do have to address it for what it is.\u201d\n\nFontes\u2019s comments came as he formed part of a Meet the Press panel of top elections officials from states whose voters could decide in November whether Joe Biden serves a second term in the White House or Donald Trump returns to the presidency.\n\nThe Guardian has reported how Arizona\u2019s most populous county, Maricopa, has taken extraordinary measures to protect its staff and the counting of ballots. Election workers there endure a daily torrent of hateful and menacing messages over email and social media as Trump and his Republican supporters continue to lie that Biden and his Democratic allies fraudulently stole the 2020 presidential race from him.\n\nFontes, a Democrat and retired US marine, told Meet the Press that such abuse was not enough to get him \u201coff of his post\u201d personally. But, he added: \u201cI will say \u2026 it has [affected] not just us but our families as well.\n\n\u201cYou know, when you have to tell your neighbors, \u2018Hey, pay attention, if something happens, the kids might have to come over,\u2019 or to have go-bags ready, or to any number of these things so many people across the country have had to suffer through \u2013 that\u2019s a problem,\u201d Fontes said. \u201cOne of the ways that I have been looking at this and addressing this is telling the really hard truth. And that is this: threats against elections officials in the United States of America is domestic terrorism.\u201d\n\nThe label of domestic terrorism is one that both the political left and right in the US constantly argue over.\n\nFor instance, federal prosecutors have avoided seeking domestic terrorism sentences for Trump supporters convicted of carrying out the deadly attack on the US Capitol after his defeat to Biden. But agencies laid the groundwork to level domestic terrorism charges against mainly liberal activists protesting against a proposed police training center in Atlanta known as Cop City.\n\nFontes said he was optimistic that the justice department was \u201creally ramping up and starting to prosecute\u201d threats aimed at election officials. Notably, in March, a Massachusetts man who had threatened to blow up Fontes\u2019s office in 2021 was handed three and a half years in prison, marking one of the most severe federal punishments yet handed down for the wave of violent threats against ballot workers driven by Trump\u2019s stolen election lies.\n\nTrump\u2019s attempts to subvert the legitimacy of Biden\u2019s victory in 2020 has been at the center of several of the more than 80 state and federal criminal charges pending against him across a total of four indictments in various jurisdictions.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working with law enforcement across the country to really start to address these things,\u201d Fontes said of election-worker security. \u201cIt\u2019s not too little, too late \u2013 but we do have to address it for what it is.\u201d",

        "text": "Could RFK Jr., Libertarian Party team up? How it could be a game-changer for him\nThe candidate previously ruled out joining forces with the Libertarian Party.\n\nCould RFK Jr., Libertarian Party team up? How it could be a game-changer for him\n\nIndependent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has previously ruled out joining the Libertarian Party -- but as the party's national convention takes place this weekend, there's speculation that they could join forces in a move that could be a boon to Kennedy's ballot-access efforts.\n\nIn April, Kennedy told ABC News that \"we're not gonna have any problems getting on the ballot ourselves so we won't be running Libertarian.\"\n\nBut the Libertarian Party, whose national convention takes place in D.C. this weekend and culminates with the party's delegates voting on Sunday to determine who it will nominate for the party's presidential ticket, had openly explored the possibility of nominating Kennedy as its candidate.\n\nIf the party's delegates vote for Kennedy, and if Kennedy reconsiders his recalcitrance to join with the party, it would mean he could possibly get on the ballot in enough states to theoretically net the 270 Electoral College votes needed to potentially qualify for the presidential debate state -- and even win the presidency.\n\nABC News has confirmed, through state election offices' websites or spokespeople, that the Libertarian Party has 2024 election ballot access in at least 37 states, including key battlegrounds such as Pennsylvania and Arizona.\n\nIndependent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. speaks at a rally, May 13, 2024, in Austin, Texas. Sergio Flores/AFP via Getty Images\n\nWith those 37 states, the party's nominee could theoretically get a maximum of 380 Electoral College votes if the candidate won them all.\n\nThe Libertarian Party has previously qualified for the ballot in all 50 states and Washington, D.C., in some previous elections, including the 2020 election. Candidates and parties alike still have time to qualify for many state ballots, with some deadlines months away and some filing windows not even open yet.\n\nThe Libertarian Party's 37 confirmed states is more than double the 15 states where the Kennedy campaign currently says it has taken the steps to make in on the ballot. Those states are Utah, New Hampshire, Hawaii, Nevada, Michigan, North Carolina, Idaho, Nebraska, Iowa, California, Delaware, Ohio, Oklahoma, Texas and New Jersey.\n\nElections offices in five of those states -- Utah, Michigan, Hawaii, Delaware, and Oklahoma -- have confirmed so far to ABC News that Kennedy or the party his campaign launched, \"We the People,\" has qualified for the ballot.\n\nKennedy has ballot access in three additional states -- Georgia, Arizona and South Carolina -- thanks to the American Values 2024 super PAC, which supports Kennedy but cannot coordinate directly with the campaign.\n\nWith those 18 states, Kennedy could theoretically get a total of 237 Electoral College votes.\n\nIndependent U.S. presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. addresses the audience during a campaign event, May 19, 2024, in Aurora, Colo. Kevin Mohatt/Reuters\n\nHaving a path to 270 Electoral College votes is among the criteria needed to qualify for the upcoming June 27 presidential debate, which will air on CNN.\n\nThere are other requirements as well, including polling thresholds. Both CNN and ABC News, for its own upcoming debate, are also requiring candidates to place at 15% in four separate national polls in a specific window as part of their respective debate qualification requirements.\n\nKennedy may be close to achieving the polling requirement by CNN's standards. A national poll from Marquette University Law School published Thursday found former President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump effectively tied among registered voters in a five-way theoretical matchup, while Kennedy netted 17%.\n\nThe Marquette poll was likely the third poll that could help Kennedy qualify, after he polled over 15% in two April polls -- from CNN/SSRS and Quinnipiac University, respectively -- that also fall within CNN's stated window.\n\nAt least five Libertarians who spoke with ABC News at the convention on Friday said Kennedy's nomination is unlikely.\n\n\"Let me tell you, there is no appetite for the type of politician that is Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. He is an establishment politician who's basically a warmed-over Democrat who doesn't like the medical establishment,\" said Chase Oliver, one of the Libertarian presidential candidates.\n\n\"I can tell you right now, if Robert Kennedy walked on the stage and said I want to be the nominee, he would get around to boos,\" he added.\n\nBut on Thursday night, Libertarian Party Chair Angela McArdle didn't rule out the fact that Kennedy could be nominated.\n\n\"There are still talks about it happening, so I really don't know ... I think we'll find out at the last minute,\" McArdle told NewsNation.\n\nABC News' Will McDuffie, Brittany Shepherd, Isabella Murray, and Soorin Kim, and 538's Geoffrey Skelley, contributed to this report.",

        "text": "Good news for Catholics in this year\u2019s \u2018Third Party Election\u2019\nDissatisfaction with the two leading American presidential candidates \u2014 and their two respective political parties \u2014 is nothing new.\n\nPew Research Center recently reported that about half of eligible voters would rather not vote for either candidate, and those who are voting will do so against the candidate they loathe, rather than for the candidate they support.\n\nSince 2010, Gallup has found that only about 1 in 4 Americans identify as Republican and 1 in 4 as Democrat, while 2 in 4 Americans identify as politically independent. But the levels of dissatisfaction with either side is remarkable: Rates of independent identification are tied for the all-time highs in the history of the Gallup poll.\n\nPew\u2019s finding last month that about half of Americans would replace both Biden and Trump if they could.\n\nThis has been borne out by the presidential candidate polls, and is notable due to the strength of third party candidates, particularly Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nIn the battleground state of Wisconsin, for instance, Biden is polling 38%, Trump 38%, Kennedy 9%, and \u201cother\u201d a substantial 15%. Similar numbers are found in battleground states like Michigan, Arizona, and Pennsylvania.\n\nOverall, Kennedy is polling at just over 10% nationally, more than enough to be a major factor in the election. Indeed, both major presidential candidates seem annoyed by the numbers third party candidates are achieving. That is probably one reason they both recently agreed to scrap the Committee on Presidential Debates in favor of an agreement with CNN that will likely keep third party candidates off the debate stage.\n\nBut we shouldn\u2019t let the cynical and manipulative political powers that be cut us off from considering third party candidates. The entrenched two-party system has been bad for the country \u2014 and even worse for Catholics \u2014 for some time now.\n\nIt has pushed millions to the negative and toxic place (with the help of social media, which also rewards negativity and toxicity) of voting against someone rather than voting for someone. It has poisoned our ideas about politics, turning it into a kind of Machiavellian game of 4-D chess about how to maneuver to defeat the \u201cbad guy.\u201d\n\nAt times, it has misled Catholics into thinking that the Democratic party or Republican party \u2014 or candidates like Donald Trump or Joe Biden \u2014 represent the truths of the Catholic faith.\n\nSadly, the right vs. left secular political fight-to-the death has been imported and even absorbed into certain places in the Church \u2014 reflected by the fact that bishops, theologians, and even parishes are often classified as \u201cconservative\u201d or \u201cliberal.\u201d\n\nBut Catholicism, which is ever ancient, ever new \u2014 the product of both the Holy Spirit's inspiration of centuries of tradition coming out of the first-century Middle East \u2014 cannot be made to fit into the dominant modes of secular U.S. politics.\n\nYet the temptation toward political idolatry pushes many Catholics to see their brothers and sisters in Christ as political enemies on \u201cthe other side\u201d to be defeated \u2014 rather than fellow Temples of the Holy Spirit to be loved as siblings.\n\nIn this column and in other places, I\u2019ve tried to self-consciously push back against this kind of idolatry. Through careful and consistent application of the vision of Christ\u2019s Church, we can move in political spaces in ways that are faithful and not hateful. Nonviolent and not vindictive. Healing and not destructive.\n\nPart of that call is to refuse to play the power game of our secular politics. Refuse to choose between two unacceptable options. In the past that might have been difficult, but this election is a real opportunity for Catholics to vote their conscience. Both major candidates are terrible. Both parties are corrupt and incoherent. We don\u2019t need to choose between them.\n\nIdentify as a pro-life Catholic? Feeling the pressure to pick the lesser of two evils here? This has been one of the reasons Catholics have dutifully played their role in the Republican vs. Democrat idolatrous duopoly. And, truth be told, there may have been times in the past where it could have made a certain amount of sense.\n\nBut Roe is gone. And, as Lila Rose of Live Action has pointed out, Trump\u2019s new feckless position on abortion is not pro-life. (Nor, of course, are his positions on torture, the death penalty, hooking up with porn stars while one\u2019s wife is pregnant, and so on.)\n\nFor his part, Biden \u2014 a Roman Catholic \u2014 has been prioritizing abortion in his campaign, saying that it should be a constitutional right. His vice president became the first person in that office to visit an abortion clinic. Neither of the two major candidates are pro-life.\n\nIndeed, the only presidential candidate who is genuinely pro-life is Peter Sonski of the young and fast-growing American Solidarity Party (ASP). If you haven\u2019t yet checked out that party, and especially if you are fed up with the options you have with Biden and Trump, I encourage you to give them a first look.\n\nBut even if the ASP isn\u2019t for you, we should refuse to stay trapped in a self-perpetuating, antagonistic two-party system that is undermining so much that is good about this country and the Church. Staying within the bounds of that system is a choice; U.S. Catholics can and should make different and better choices.\n\nHappily, this election is setting up to be the best one in a long time for doing precisely this.",

        "text": "Florida Man Convicted of Assaulting Law Enforcement and Other Charges During Jan. 6 Capitol Breach\nWASHINGTON \u2013 A Florida man was convicted today of assaulting a Prince George's County Police Officer, felony civil disorder, and six misdemeanor offenses, two of which involve physical violence on Capitol grounds during the Jan. 6, 2021, breach of the U.S. Capitol. His actions and the actions of others disrupted a joint session of the U.S. Congress convened to ascertain and count the electoral votes related to the 2020 presidential election.\n\nU.S. District Judge Carl J. Nichols found Jesse James Rumson, 38, of Lecanto, Florida, guilty of civil disorder and assaulting, resisting, or impeding certain officers, both felony offenses, following a bench trial in District Court.\n\nIn addition to the two felonies, Rumson was found guilty of six misdemeanor offenses, including entering and remaining in a restricted building or grounds, disorderly and disruptive conduct in a restricted building or grounds, engaging in physical violence in a restricted building or grounds, disorderly conduct in a Capitol building, act of physical violence in a Capitol building, and parading, demonstrating, or picketing in a Capitol building.\n\nJudge Nichols will sentence Rumson on Sept. 5, 2024.\n\nAccording to evidence presented during the trial, on Jan. 5, 2021, Rumson drove with a friend from his home in Lecanto, Florida, to Washington, D.C., and on January 6th, attended the Stop the Steal Rally at the Ellipse and, for the first half of his day, was wearing a large headpiece that appeared to be from a panda costume.\n\nAfter the rally, Rumson marched with the crowd down Pennsylvania Avenue toward Capitol grounds. By approximately 2:00 p.m., Rumson was among the thousands of rioters that had breached the Capitol\u2019s restricted perimeter, which was denoted by bike rack barricades with \u201cAREA CLOSED\u201d signs, among other things. As he stood on the Lower West Terrace, near the northwest stairs, Rumson could see rioters battling the outnumbered United States Capitol Police (USCP) officers. Rumson could also see and hear the crowd that was encouraging the rioters to push the officers backward, forcing them to retreat up the steps.\n\nRumson then climbed the Northwest Stairs underneath the scaffolding. Around 2:42 p.m., after seeing and hearing another rioter smash in the windows of the Parliamentarian Door and unlatch it from the inside, Rumson bolted to that door, launched himself over the railing to the stairs leading up to it, and entered the Capitol building in his panda headpiece. After an altercation with the police inside the building, Rumson emerged from the same door in handcuffs 13 minutes later, this time without the panda headpiece and backpack, and with red eyes and skin from pepper spray.\n\nThe FBI arrested Rumson on Feb. 27, 2023, in Florida.\n\nDuring courtroom proceedings, Judge Nichols found that Rumson\u2019s version of the events of January 6th, to be \u201cabsurd\u201d and \u201cpatently incompatible with the objective evidence and testimony.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Columbia and the Department of Justice National Security Division\u2019s Counterterrorism Section are prosecuting this case. The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Middle District of Florida provided valuable assistance.\n\nThe FBI\u2019s Jacksonville and Washington Field Offices investigated this case. Valuable assistance was provided by the Citrus County (FL) Sheriff\u2019s Office, the U.S. Capitol Police and the Metropolitan Police Department.\n\nIn the 40 months since Jan. 6, 2021, more than 1,424 individuals have been charged in nearly all 50 states for crimes related to the breach of the U.S. Capitol, including more than 500 individuals charged with assaulting or impeding law enforcement, a felony. The investigation remains ongoing.\n\nAnyone with tips can call 1-800-CALL-FBI (800-225-5324) or visit tips.fbi.gov",

And safeguards are in place for mailed ballots. Yet distrust in the system remains high among Republican voters.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re automatically going to have fraud.\u201d\n\nSince his rise to the heights of politics nine years ago, former U.S. President Donald Trump has continuously denounced mail-in voting as a concrete example of what he claims is endemic fraud in American elections.\n\nWithout evidence, he has depicted mail voting as an open portal in many states, an easy way for Democrats, foreign countries, or unauthorized immigrants to shovel millions of fake, election-flipping votes into the electoral system.\n\nRecently his message has changed, as campaign advisers worry that President Joe Biden has built a large mail-in advantage in swing states. Absentee and early voting are \u201cgood options,\u201d said a post on Mr. Trump\u2019s Truth Social account this week.\n\nBut it may be difficult to undo what attacks have already accomplished. Suspicion about mail-in voting has become deeply entrenched among Republicans. Sixty-two percent of GOP and GOP-leaning voters oppose allowing people to vote using mailed ballots without an excuse, according to a 2023 Associated Press/NORC Center for Public Affairs poll. Among Democrats, the opinion is almost reversed: About 70% support no-excuse mail voting.\n\nElection officials from both parties say mail-in ballots are a secure and effective means of increasing American participation in elections. It is true that many states relaxed restrictions on mail-in use for the 2020 election. But that was due to the COVID-19 pandemic, officials say, not a conspiracy to tilt the vote for Mr. Biden.\n\nIn Voting We Trust? Loading the player... To some degree, members of one major political party or the other have historically swung into distrust mode when it comes to elections \u2013 typically (and predictably) when their own parties have been down. What\u2019s different now: One side is stuck on denialism. That\u2019s despite a lack of evidence that fraud exists on a scale that could change an election, especially on the national level. Veteran Washington-watcher Peter Grier joins host Gail Chaddock to talk about mistrust \u2013 and about the fact that it might not really run nearly as deep as many seem to think.\n\nExperts add that they believe trust in mail-in votes \u2013 and in U.S. elections overall \u2013 can be rebuilt with communication and education. Transparency about how mail-in ballots are distributed, handled, and counted could counteract disinformation that calls the practice into question.\n\nVoting used to happen \u201cin view of the public,\u201d says Derek Lyons, president of Restoring Integrity and Trust in Elections and a former counselor to the president in the Trump administration. With voting by mail, a process that takes place in private, \u201ceven if it\u2019s all happening perfectly, people have to be able to trust it.\u201d\n\nGregory Bull/AP/File Election workers process ballots at the Clark County Election Department, Nov. 10, 2022, in Las Vegas. Republican lawsuits after the 2020 election failed to show evidence of widespread fraud that could have affected outcomes in the presidential race.\n\nHow mail-in voting has grown, in all 50 states\n\nEight states and Washington, D.C., allow all elections to be conducted entirely by mail. Beyond that, states allow a varying amount of voting by mail, from permitting counties to opt in to allowing mostly mail elections for small jurisdictions.\n\nAll states, though, offer some degree of mail voting, whether it be mailed absentee ballots for voters who cannot make it to the polls on Election Day or no-excuse-needed mail ballots. Twenty-eight states allow any voter to request and cast a mail ballot.\n\nWhile mail voting isn\u2019t new across the board, it is new in some jurisdictions, or newly expanded. During the pandemic, nearly every state increased its use of mail-in voting, and many of those expansions remain today.\n\nSo for people in areas where voting by mail was less common prior to the pandemic, public perception may still be catching up to the new reality of their electoral systems.\n\nIn states where voting by mail is newer, \u201ca lot of people don\u2019t want to give up that experience of voting in person and that sense of satisfaction and even that sense of community of being there physically with other voters that comes with going to the polls,\u201d says Michael Morley, a law professor and election law expert at Florida State University.\n\nNationally, use of mail voting more than doubled from the 2016 to the 2020 presidential elections, from 20% to 43% of ballots cast. In the 2022 midterms, held as the COVID-19 pandemic was abating, mail votes fell back to 31% of the total.\n\nSafeguards against fraud for mailed ballots\n\nIn general, voters must request a mail ballot. In a handful of states, ballots are automatically mailed to registered voters. Any ballot that\u2019s returned is cross-checked with details on the state\u2019s voter rolls, including matching the signature on the ballot with the signature on file for that voter. Ballots are disqualified for any number of discrepancies, including if the signatures differ.\n\nEvery person on a state\u2019s centralized voter list who is sent a mail ballot is flagged so that they cannot vote twice \u2013 once via the post office, once in person. Many states print bar codes on ballot envelopes that allow voters to track their ballot and see whether it has been received. The codes are also helpful in post-election audits.\n\nBallot design can serve as an additional safety measure. To be counted, fake ballots would need to mimic the size, print, paper weight, envelope, and other characteristics of genuine ballots. Yet those can differ county to county, and election to election.\n\nIn addition some states have outlawed the gathering and submitting of mail-in ballots by third parties, known as \u201cballot collecting\u201d or as \u201cballot harvesting\u201d to its opponents. The theory behind the bans is that the practice is particularly vulnerable to vote tampering.\n\nHow distrust has risen\n\nIn the U.S. electorate as a whole, trust in mail-in voting has declined somewhat in recent years. Just prior to the 2020 election, 56% of voters were strongly or somewhat in favor of allowing people to vote by mail instead of in person without requiring them to give a reason, according to the AP-NORC survey. A few months after the 2022 midterms, that measure had slid to 47% of voters.\n\nBut that change was driven largely by Republicans souring on the practice. In 2023, 24% of GOP voters were strongly or somewhat in favor of no-reason mail-in voting, as opposed to 71% of Democrats and 47% of independents, according to AP-NORC numbers.\n\nThe irony is that mail-in voting was established first in Western states, many of which now trend conservative. Their wide-open spaces and low population density can make getting voters to the polls on a single Election Day more difficult than in the relatively crowded East.\n\n\u201cUntil 2020, voting by mail was embraced by both parties almost equally,\u201d says David Becker, executive director of The Center for Election Innovation and Research.\n\nJohn Locher/AP/File People wait in line to vote at a polling place Nov. 8, 2022, in Las Vegas.\n\nTwo aspects of mail-in ballots raise particular concern among critics. One is that the ballot is cast outside the public eye, making it easier for someone to coerce the voter to vote a particular way, or for an impersonator to cast the ballot to begin with. The second is that their delivery method is not rock-solid secure, raising concerns about the vote being tampered with or lost entirely.\n\nOverall, election-related fraud is \u201cvery, very rare,\u201d says Professor Morley. Yet experts generally agree that fraud related to mail-in voting is more frequent than in-person voting abuses.\n\nIn 1997, cases involving absentee and mail-in ballot fraud resulted in well-publicized convictions in Georgia and Florida. More recently, in Bladen County, North Carolina, political operative Leslie McCrae Dowless paid people to collect absentee ballots from voters\u2019 doorsteps, and then fill in votes and forge signatures in an attempt to stuff the box for GOP candidate Mark Harris in a 2018 congressional election.\n\nIt is difficult to tamper with ballots on a scale large enough to have an effect on anything but elections with a small number of voters, however. In state or national elections, even close finishes often involve margins of hundreds or thousands of votes.\n\nIt is easy to notice discrepancies of that size.\n\n\u201cIf you want to become a five-to-10-year tenant of the federal prison system, committing bulk mail voting fraud is a really great way to do it,\u201d says Mr. Becker.\n\nThe polarization of a voting method\n\nThe most outspoken critic of mail-in ballots in the United States is, of course, former President Trump. He railed against the practice during his 2016 campaign, but his anti-mail-in rhetoric exploded in intensity as the 2020 presidential election neared. In July 2020, then-President Trump suggested in a social media post that the upcoming vote be postponed, since \u201cUniversal Mail-in Voting\u201d would make it \u201cthe most INACCURATE & FRAUDULENT Election in history.\u201d\n\nSubsequently he publicly warned that millions of mail-in ballots would be printed by foreign countries, resulting in a \u201crigged\u201d election, and that Democrats were mailing out \u201c80 million unsolicited ballots\u201d so they could \u201charvest\u201d votes to elect Mr. Biden.\n\nThose charges were false. There remains no documented evidence of widespread fraud in 2020. Election officials from both parties have testified that the vote was free and fair, as have numerous former Trump administration appointees. The Trump campaign lost virtually every court case it filed in the wake of Mr. Trump\u2019s loss.\n\nBut Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks found a receptive audience among his supporters. Since 2020, he has continued to denounce the election results in general and mail ballots in particular.\n\nThus attitudes toward mail-in voting are now politically polarized, like attitudes about COVID-19 vaccines, climate change, and abortion. Voters\u2019 opinions are based not just on their personal views but also on the attitudes of the leaders of their political team.\n\nThat makes changing them doubly difficult. What might otherwise be grumbling discontent has been raised to party dogma.\n\n\u201cHaving a presidential candidate refuse to accept the election\u2019s outcome intensified everything, added whole new dimensions to everything,\u201d Professor Morley says.\n\nAndrew Selsky/AP/File John Kennedy, hired by Marion County, Oregon, through a staffing service, accepts a voter's ballot near the county clerk's office in Salem Nov. 7, 2022. Oregon voters can mail in their votes or drop them off at official locations.\n\nHow to build trust in voting by mail\n\nAs the nation heads into the 2024 election, the surprise is that many state and national Republican officials would like Mr. Trump to reverse his message and plug GOP participation in mail-in balloting.\n\nThey are looking for any edge they can gain against a Democratic Party that has long embraced the practice.\n\nIn April, Donald Trump Jr., the former president\u2019s son, was featured in two ads promoting mail-in voting that ran in Pennsylvania, a crucial battleground.\n\nIn May, the former president printed a pro-mail-in post on his Truth Social account. \u201cABSENTEE VOTING, EARLY VOTING, AND ELECTION DAY VOTING ARE ALL GOOD OPTIONS,\u201d said the post.\n\nBut in person, Mr. Trump continues to deliver a mixed message. At a recent rally in Wisconsin, the state\u2019s GOP chairman and other officials took the stage first and urged attendees to embrace early voting, whether in person or by absentee ballot. Mr. Trump, however, hammered the Wisconsin voting system when he took the stage, saying he would have won the 2020 election in the state if not for fake absentee ballots in Milwaukee.\n\n\u201cWe won the state by a lot,\u201d Mr. Trump told the crowd, though in reality he lost it to Mr. Biden by some 21,000 votes.\n\nWhether Republicans will change their minds about mail-in voting now remains to be seen. In 2022, the percentages of GOP voters who used the option did tick upward somewhat.\n\nFor election officials, sticking to basics might help with voters suspicious of the sudden expanse of the practice in the pandemic years, says Mr. Lyons.\n\n\u201cTest the machines, secure the drop boxes, verify identities, send ballots only to people who asked for them,\u201d he says. \u201cThese are simple things that you can do to shut down the ability for people to call the election into question after the fact.\u201d\n\nOther experts emphasize the need for education.\n\nOver the years, election officials have seen their roles expand from essentially event managers, to include the need to be information technology specialists, then cybersecurity experts, and now outreach coordinators, says Wendy Underhill, director of elections and redistricting at the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve found themselves spending more time on the education process, and they are always welcoming to groups\u201d who want to learn about ballot design and printing, and then how ballots are collected, processed, counted, and collated, says Ms. Underhill.\n\n\u201cThe communications piece is just more prominent than it was\u201d a decade ago, she says.\n\nThat outreach is key, because most people simply feel comfortable with what\u2019s familiar, says Ms. Underhill, whether that\u2019s mail or in-person voting.\n\nIf people have doubts about election integrity generally, Scott Schwab, secretary of state of Kansas, has a clear answer: \u201cWork the polls.\u201d\n\nHands-on experience as a voting station volunteer is \u201cthe biggest advocate we have\u201d to dispel doubts about whether U.S. elections are secure, says Mr. Schwab.\n\nElection education has always been an important responsibility of election officials, says Mr. Schwab. But as times change, \u201cthe way we do it has changed.\u201d\n\nDeepen your worldview\n\nwith Monitor Highlights. By signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy Already a subscriber?

The video explanations, flyers, and information sessions election officials host across the country are all important.\n\nBut there\u2019s no substitute for actually working an election. When people do that, they report being surprised by the complexity of elections and the levels of security, he says.",

        "text": "Ohio governor calls special session to pass legislation ensuring President Biden is on 2024 ballot\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) \u2014 Ohio\u2019s Republican Gov. Mike DeWine said Thursday that he is calling a rare special session of the General Assembly next week to pass legislation ensuring that President Joe Biden is on the state\u2019s 2024 ballot.\n\nThe special session was called for Tuesday.\n\n\u201cOhio is running out of time to get Joe Biden, the sitting President of the United States, on the ballot this fall. Failing to do so is simply unacceptable. This is ridiculous. This is (an) absurd situation,\u201d DeWine said.\n\nThe question of whether Biden will appear on the ballot has become entangled in a partisan legislative fight to keep foreign money out of state ballot campaigns, a year after cash tied to a Swiss billionaire boosted a successful effort to enshrine abortion rights in the solidly red state\u2019s constitution.\n\nThe Democratic National Convention, where Biden is to be formally nominated, falls after Ohio\u2019s ballot deadline of Aug. 7. The convention will be held Aug. 19-22 in Chicago.\n\nSince Ohio changed its certification deadline from 60 to 90 days ahead of the general election, state lawmakers have had to adjust the requirement twice, in 2012 and 2020, to accommodate candidates of both parties. Each change was only temporary.\n\nThis year lawmakers were unable to come up with a fix by the May 9 cutoff set by Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose.\n\nWhat to know about Trump\u2019s second term:\n\nStaffing the administration: Here are the people Trump has picked recess appointments Follow all of our coverage as Donald Trump assembles his second administration.\n\nDeWine said he spoke to LaRose on Thursday and he said we\u2019re \u201cup against a wall.\u201d LaRose told him next Wednesday is the drop-dead deadline.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve waited. I\u2019ve been patient. And my patience has run out,\u201d DeWine said.\n\nDeWine said his proclamation will allow for passing a Senate version of the bill that also bans foreign nationals from contributing to Ohio ballot measures.\n\nThe proposal has been described as a \u201cpoison pill\u201d in the fractured Ohio House, where Republicans rely on Democratic votes for pass some legislation.\n\nIn a statement, a spokesman for Senate President Matt Huffman encouraged House leadership to allow a vote on House Bill 114.\n\n\u201cWe agree with the Governor. It is time to protect Ohio\u2019s elections by outlawing foreign campaign contributions, while at the same time fixing the Democratic Party\u2019s error that kept Joe Biden off the November ballot,\u201d the statement said.\n\nDeWine spokesman Dan Tierney said after the governor spoke that a \u201cclean\u201d House bill that would change the ballot deadline on a permanent basis also could be considered.\n\nOhio House Democratic leader Allison Russo said via the social platform X that money from foreign donors is already illegal and the real issue is dark money going to candidates.\n\n\u201cGOP strategy: change the rules when you can\u2019t win,\u201d Russo said. \u201cThey\u2019re terrified when citizens use their voice w/ direct democracy, so now they want to completely upend citizens\u2019 ability to fund ballot initiatives. Any talk of \u201cforeign money\u201d is a red herring.\u201d\n\nState Democratic Party Chair Elizabeth Walters accused GOP lawmakers of politicizing the process and disenfranchising Ohioans.\n\n\u201cWe must pass the Ohio Anti-Corruption Act, which would require dark money groups to identify their funders, disclose their spending, and strengthen the ban on foreign money,\u201d Walters said in a statement.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, Republican politicians who hold supermajorities in both chambers at the statehouse must put politics aside and pass a clean bill to put Joe Biden on the ballot,\u201d she continued. \u201cDespite Republicans\u2019 political gamesmanship, we\u2019re confident Joe Biden will be on the Ohio ballot.\u201d\n\nRepublican state House Speaker Jason Stephens said lawmakers have language that bans foreign influence from ballot issue campaigns without hurting the rights of citizens.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to real solutions that will actually pass both chambers next week and solve problems,\u201d Stephens said in a statement.\n\nAnd fellow Republican JD Vance, U.S. senator from Ohio, issued a statement saying the calling of a special session is a \u201creasonable compromise.\u201d\n\nVance expressed confidence that former President Donald Trump would beat Biden regardless of whether he\u2019s on the ballot, but he said \u201ca lot of Trump voters might sit at home if there isn\u2019t a real presidential race, and that will really hurt our down ballot races for the Senate and Congress. We need to play chess.\u201d\n\nThe Ohio Republican Party strongly supports DeWine\u2019s decision, chairman Alex M. Triantafilou said.\n\nThere was no immediate response by the Biden campaign to a message requesting comment.\n\nAlabama recently changed its law to ensure Biden will appear on fall ballots. The Alabama bill offered accommodations to the president like those made four years ago for then-President Donald Trump.\n\nThe last time Ohio lawmakers were ordered back to Columbus in a such a manner was in 2004, under Republican Gov. Bob Taft, to consider campaign finance reform",

        "text": "The Housing Market During Election Years\nKey takeaways Despite the common belief that elections negatively impact the housing market, data does not prove out that theory.\n\nThe housing market is influenced by a variety of factors, including supply and interest rates, that have a greater impact than a presidential election.\n\nFor most Americans, election results will have little direct effect on their income and therefore should not significantly impact their decision to buy or sell a home.\n\nAnother presidential election looms, and that means it\u2019s time to debate the quadrennial questions about the future of the republic, the fairness of the Electoral College and the effects of the election on the U.S. housing market.\n\nConventional wisdom holds that the general uncertainty caused by an election pushes many would-be homebuyers to the sidelines. But housing economists say there\u2019s little evidence that elections \u2014 either the run-up to them or the results \u2014 actually affect home values. That assertion is underscored by the statistics.\n\nThe housing market in election years: What history shows\n\nWhile there\u2019s a persistent notion that presidential elections hamper the housing market, recent history tells a different story. There have been nine elections since 1987. Contrary to what many would expect, home price appreciation in those years actually outpaced appreciation in the 28 non-election years since, according to a Bankrate analysis of the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Home Price Index.\n\nCase-Shiller data shows that, on average, home prices have climbed 4.84 percent in election years since 1987. In non-election years, values rose 4.44 percent. That might lead to the conclusion that presidential elections are good for the housing market, but the reality is far more nuanced.\n\nYear Appreciation SOURCE: Case-Shiller Home Price Index 1987 7.22% 1988 7.23% 1989 4.39% 1990 -0.69% 1991 -0.17% 1992 0.82% 1993 2.16% 1994 2.52% 1995 1.79% 1996 2.43% 1997 4.02% 1998 6.44% 1999 7.68% 2000 9.29% 2001 6.68% 2002 9.56% 2003 9.82% 2004 13.64% 2005 13.51% 2006 1.73% 2007 -5.40% 2008 -12.00% 2009 -3.85% 2010 -4.11% 2011 -3.88% 2012 6.44% 2013 10.71% 2014 4.51% 2015 5.20% 2016 5.31% 2017 6.21% 2018 4.52% 2019 3.68% 2020 10.43% 2021 18.87% 2022 5.65% 2023 5.56%\n\nFor instance, the worst year for the housing market in recent decades by far was 2008. Home values plunged 12 percent that year, according to Case-Shiller. That had little to do with Barack Obama\u2019s battle with John McCain \u2014 rather, the drop in home prices was all about economic timing. The historic housing bubble of 2004 to 2007 finally had burst, and the global economy was collapsing.\n\nMeanwhile, one of the best years for home prices was 2004. Home values soared 13.4 percent, a result that was mostly due to the inflating housing bubble, not George W. Bush\u2019s re-election that year.\n\nThe best year for home values since 1987 came in 2021. Values soared 18.9 percent that year amid record-low mortgage rates and the COVID-19 housing boom \u2014 not because it was Joe Biden\u2019s first year in office.\n\n\u201cHistorically, the housing market doesn\u2019t tend to look very different in presidential election years compared to other years,\u201d says Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist at Bright MLS, a large listing service in the mid-Atlantic region. \u201cIt\u2019s really about demographics and the economy.\u201d\n\nWhat drives housing prices?\n\nHome values are driven by a complex combination of factors, including the available supply of housing, the demand for those homes and the trajectory of mortgage rates. It\u2019s not a simple formula, and that complexity leads to plenty of conjecture about the role of various factors that may or may not affect the housing market. Election years are one such factor.\n\n\u201cMany speculate on how presidential elections impact home prices,\u201d says Ken H. Johnson, an economist at Florida Atlantic University. But for all the hypothesizing, there\u2019s no clear evidence that elections much matter: \u201cTo date, there is no statistical evidence that one winning side versus the other has any impact on home prices,\u201d Johnson says.\n\nPresidential candidates often stress their economic plans, but economists generally agree that presidents have little to no influence over a market as broad as the U.S. housing sector.\n\nHousing starts, unemployment, interest rates and a multitude of other factors are more important than what\u2019s happening on the national political scene, says Michael Seiler, a housing economist at the College of William & Mary in Virginia.\n\n\u201cThose other factors overwhelm the presidential election,\u201d Seiler says. \u201cThe president has only so much he or she can do to control the economy.\u201d\n\nIndeed, for a president to truly swing the market, he would need to direct the purchase or sale of large quantities of homes \u2014 something not in the purview of the commander in chief. Presidents do not set mortgage rates either. In one example of the limits of presidential power, Joe Biden in 2020 made a first-time homebuyer tax credit a centerpiece of his housing platform. As of 2024, that policy has yet to be enacted.\n\nShould I buy or sell a house in an election year?\n\nIf you\u2019re considering buying or selling a home, there\u2019s essentially no reason to let campaign season change your plans. If you work for a federal agency and might lose your job if the incumbent loses, then the election affects your finances directly. But for most Americans, the outcome of the election will have little direct effect on their income \u2014 and therefore, you can safely ignore national politics while making your real estate decision.",

On the other end was a AI-generated voice that sounded like Biden and discouraged Democrats from voting.\n\nKramer has also been indicted on criminal charges in four New Hampshire counties, including 13 counts of voter suppression, a felony, and 13 counts of impersonating a candidate, a misdemeanor.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cI hope that our respective enforcement actions send a strong deterrent signal to anyone who might consider interfering with elections, whether through the use of artificial intelligence or otherwise,\" New Hampshire Attorney General John Formella said in a statement announcing the charges.\n\nThe Biden deepfake is the most high-profile example of how the rapid proliferation of generative artificial intelligence, which can quickly and easily produce realistic audio, video, images and text, is creating new avenues for fraud, scams and manipulation.\n\n\"This is unnerving,\" FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel said on Thursday of the New Hampshire robocall. \"Because when a caller sounds like a politician you know, a celebrity you like, or a family member who is familiar, any one of us could be tricked into believing something that is not true with calls using AI technology.\"\n\nThe FCC ruled in February that using AI-generated voices in robocall is illegal.\n\nIn its announcement of the proposed fine, the FCC said Kramer violated federal law by spoofing the number of a local political figure. Kramer will have a chance to respond and offer evidence before the FCC issues a final decision. The agency also proposed a $2 million fine against Lingo Telecom, the company accused of transmitting the robocall.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nNeither Kramer nor Lingo responded to requests for comment. Kramer has said he created the deepfake as a warning about the dangers of AI.",

        "text": "Analysis Shows Trump's Escalated Talk of a 'Rigged' 2024 Election\nPresumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump has cast doubt on the fairness of the 2024 presidential election result significantly more than he had by this time in 2016 or 2020, according to an analysis published Friday in The New York Times.\n\nThe Times found more than 500 instances of Trump falsely accusing Democrats of trying to rig, cheat, or steal the 2024 election, or of having done so in 2020. This is a significant increase from the 2020 cycle, when Trump did so roughly 100 times, and 2016, when he did not begin regularly raising concerns about the election's legitimacy until the final weeks of his campaign against Hillary Clinton.\n\n\"Though the tactic is familiar\u2014Mr. Trump raised the specter of a 'rigged' election in the 2016 and 2020 cycles, too\u2014his attempts to undermine the 2024 contest are a significant escalation,\" the Times reported, based on its search of social media posts, interviews, and records of campaign events.\n\n\n\nIn the 2024 cycle, Donald Trump has escalated his accusations that Democrats are trying to rig or interfere with the election, according to analysis published Friday in The New York Times, which searched social media posts, interviews, and records of campaign events. (Source: The New York Times)\n\nTrump has cast doubt on the upcoming election's fairness about once per day since he announced his candidacy\u2014engaging in a strategy the Times referred to as \"heads, I win; tails, you cheated.\"\n\nDean Baker, an economist at Center for Economic and Policy Research, referred to the Times' findings as a \"big deal\" on social media, while Ian Bremmer, a political scientist at Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs, jokingly said, in response to the article, that 2024 was \"off to a great start.\"\n\nThe Times analysis illustrates that in the 2024 cycle, Trump has broadened his argument about unfairness, suggesting not just that presidential elections are rigged against him but that the Democrats have a strategy of \"election interference\" that includes legal cases against him. After announcing his candidacy in November 2022, Trump began to argue that the legal cases against him \"constituted a 'new way of cheating' in order to 'interfere' in the 2024 election,\" the Times reported. Trump called the appointment of a special counsel to investigate him a \"rigged deal, just as the 2020 election was rigged.\"\n\nIn so doing, Trump has attempted to \"undermine democracy\" by conflating claims of a stolen election and claims of interference by means of legal action, argued Edward Foley, a constitutional law professor at Ohio State University, in Election Law Blog on Friday.\n\nTurning to media criticism, Foley wrote that the Times repeated Trump's mistaken conflation in its new analysis. Though Trump collapses these arguments, the Times should not, he wrote, arguing that the analysis wrongly lumps together two distinct phenomena:\n\n\n\n(1) Trump's false claim that he, not [President Joe] Biden, won more valid votes in enough states for 270 electoral votes in 2020, once allegedly fraudulent and thus unlawful votes are discounted, with (2) Trump's complaints that the electoral process is 'rigged' against him. Perhaps the most famous example of the first category is Trump's brazen assertion on Election Night that 'frankly, we did win this election.' An example in the second category, which the Times cites (without distinguishing it from the first kind of claim) is Trump's assertion that this year's election is 'rigged' because of the Biden [Department of Justice]'s prosecutions of him.\n\nTrump is not alone in preemptively questioning the legitimacy of November's election results. Prominent Republicans are \"already rushing to buy into Trump's 2024 election fraud narrative,\" CNN's Stephen Collinson wrote earlier Friday. Senators such as Ted Cruz (R-Texas), J.D. Vance (R-Ohio), and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) have all failed to commit to honoring the election results despite the fact that \"there is no indication that there will be irregularities in the election,\" Collinson wrote.\n\nIn fact, no leading contenders to be Trump's running mate\u2014a list that includes Vance and Rubio\u2014have committed to accepting the election results if Biden wins, according to NBC News.\n\nTrump has hurt public confidence in elections, a pillar of democracy, in a way that will have long-term ramifications, Richard Hasen, a law professor at University of California, Los Angeles, wrote in Politico in January. \"Without 'loser's consent'\u2014when those on the losing end of an election accept the results as fairly determined\u2014democracy falters. Trump has succeeded in undermining the foundation of that... pillar for everyone, whether or not he's victorious as a candidate in 2024,\" Hasen wrote.\n\n",

        "text": "Why are thousands of people protesting in Taiwan?\nTaipei, Taiwan \u2013 Protests are expected to resume in Taiwan on Friday over a divisive bill that would greatly expand the investigative powers of parliament and has already drawn tens of thousands of people onto the streets.\n\nProtesters gathered outside the legislature on Tuesday to coincide with the first reading of the bill, which legislators took up again on Friday for the second reading.\n\nWhile many democracies have similar provisions for legislative investigations \u2013 like the Watergate investigation in the United States or the phone hacking scandal in the United Kingdom \u2013 protesters say authors of the Taiwan bill have railroaded it through the voting process, and that it lacks the checks and balances necessary to prevent abuse.\n\nCivil society and many legal scholars also oppose the bill, but the Kuomintang (KMT), which is backing it, says the reforms are necessary to \u201cconsolidate and refine\u201d Taiwan\u2019s democracy. A separate bill, that would facilitate an ambitious but controversial infrastructure project to link the island\u2019s east and west coasts, has also drawn the ire of protesters.\n\nThis week\u2019s protests followed a brawl last Friday in the legislature over the same bill \u2013 something of a Taiwanese political tradition.\n\nThe opposition KMT, along with the smaller Taiwan People\u2019s Party (TPP), secured a majority in parliament in January\u2019s election, while William Lai Ching-te, from the rival Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), was elected president.\n\nHere is all you need to know.\n\nWhy is this bill so controversial?\n\nCritics of the bill say its scope is too wide and potentially unconstitutional. The bill would, in theory, grant legislators the power to question, investigate or demand documents from any government official, military general or the president.\n\nThis demand includes a vaguely worded clause about \u201ccontempt of the legislature\u201d, which critics say could be used punitively for asking questions or \u201ctalking back\u201d, criminalising officials who are unwilling to cooperate. Critics also say the bill is duplicating the work of the Control Yuan, a special government body empowered to investigate legislators and audit the government.\n\nCritics fear the bill could threaten Taiwan\u2019s national security, as it might force government officials to disclose critical information, according to Austin Wang, a US-based political scientist specialising in Taiwanese politics.\n\n\u201cIn the bill, the legislators can ask the military to hand in sensitive information, which is problematic since some legislators have been accused of leaking information to China. There is no check-and-balance under this investigation any more,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat about the controversial infrastructure project?\n\nWhile it has drawn fewer headlines, the bill also includes plans for a controversial $61bn infrastructure project that would build a high-speed rail and improve highways on Taiwan\u2019s less-populous east coast. The region is known for its rugged natural beauty, but it is also earthquake-prone and susceptible to typhoons and landslides, which is why the project has yet to be attempted.\n\nWang told Al Jazeera the size of the plan is untenable because it is equivalent to Taiwan\u2019s annual budget. It would take away much-needed funding for Taiwan\u2019s military if it hopes to deter China from a military attack.\n\nHe also said the plan might force Taiwan to take funding from China, which claims sovereignty over the island, and despite regularly threatening Taiwan\u2019s existence, is also its largest trading partner.\n\nWhy are protesters calling the bill undemocratic?\n\nThis topic has been under discussion for some time in Taiwan\u2019s legislative committees, but DPP legislators and critics say the KMT and the TPP are trying to push through their version of the bill without any consultation or input. DPP legislators allege they did not get to see the full text of the bill before it was put forward for a vote.\n\nThe timing of the bill is notable because it coincides with Lai\u2019s inauguration. He took his oath of office on Monday marking the start of an unprecedented third term for the DPP.\n\nThe bill suggests it could be a bumpy political road ahead.\n\nWilliam Stanton, a former director of the American Institute in Taiwan, the de facto US embassy, told Al Jazeera the KMT and TPP appear to be engaged in a power play after losing the presidential election. Traditionally, Taiwan\u2019s legislative agenda has been set by the executive branch of government, but the two parties appear set to shake up the system.\n\n\u201cI think it shows that [the KMT and TPP] see their majority in the Legislative Yuan as basically a backdoor way to undermine the election of Lai Ching-te. It\u2019s unfortunate but that seems to be the case,\u201d Stanton said.\n\nWu Min Hsuan, the co-founder of disinformation monitor Double Think Lab, said protesters were also not pleased about such behaviour.\n\n\u201cPeople are generally concerned that the KMT and TPP can pass any law they want, and take away any kind of deliberation. They don\u2019t need the committee to agree with anything,\u201d Wu said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want a \u2018winner takes all\u2019. We don\u2019t want if you have a majority of the parliament, you can take away that minority\u2019s voice \u2013 because otherwise we don\u2019t need legislators at all.\u201d\n\nWhat does the furore tell us about where Taiwan is heading?\n\nTaiwan has a strong protest tradition and it is not unusual to see people out on the streets, but observers say the latest demonstrations are worth watching.\n\nThe feeling in the air is already reminiscent of 2014\u2019s Sunflower Movement when student protesters occupied the legislature to block a trade bill that would have brought Taiwan closer to China. Much like 2014, the latest protests have drawn students and young people.\n\nThe strong youth showing is also notable for another reason.\n\nDuring election season in December and January, the DPP struggled to attract their usual demographic of younger voters with many drawn to the TPP, which was promising new thinking under the iconoclastic former mayor of Taipei, Ko Wen-je. If the protest continues to grow at the legislature, it could change that narrative.",

South Carolina Conference of the NAACP gerrymandering case in Washington, DC, October 11, 2023. \u00a9 2023 Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call via AP Photo\n\nOn May 23, 2024, the US Supreme Court issued a 6-3 decision that allows racial discrimination in the drawing of voting maps, dismissing the voices of Black voters challenging racial gerrymandering and undermining efforts to build a multiracial democracy in the United States.\n\nThe ruling is inconsistent with international human rights treaties binding on the United States that require the US to protect the right to vote without discrimination and prohibit policies that have the effect of discriminating based on race, whatever their purported intent.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed a lower court ruling that found South Carolina Republican state legislators discriminated against Black voters when drawing recent congressional maps. The lower court found the South Carolina map violated the right to equal protection of the law under the US Constitution.\n\nWhen the South Carolina legislature redrew Congressional District 1 in 2021, it removed hundreds of thousands of residents from the district, including more than 60 percent of Black residents in Charleston County. Even the state\u2019s appointed mapmaker admitted the new map created \u201ctremendous racial disparity.\u201d The result ensures that Black South Carolinians will only have a meaningful chance to elect one of seven representatives to the US Congress, despite making up over one quarter of the state\u2019s population.\n\nBlack voters have argued the new map suppresses their voices, diminishes their political power, and is discriminatory. They asked the courts to provide a remedy for those claims of discrimination and infringement on their voting rights.\n\nThe Supreme Court majority sided with South Carolina Republican legislators who said the map was primarily designed using political voting patterns rather than race. Their decision rejected evidence the lower court used to determine that South Carolina had significantly relied on racial data during its redistricting process.\n\nThe three dissenting Supreme Court justices highlighted the ruling\u2019s devastating implications, warning that the Court was sending a message to state legislatures that they could suppress the votes of minority communities, so long as they created a race-neutral justification for doing so. Justice Elena Kagan wrote, \u201cIn the electoral sphere especially, where \u2018ugly patterns of pervasive racial discrimination\u2019 have so long governed, we should demand better \u2013 of ourselves, of our political representatives, and most of all of this Court.\u201d\n\nCongress should pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which would prevent states with histories of racial discrimination from implementing maps like the one that now stands in South Carolina.",

        "text": "Haley will vote for the Trump \u2018chaos\u2019 that she once decried\nCNN \u2014\n\nThe political calculation has changed again for Nikki Haley.\n\nNot long ago, the former South Carolina governor was arguing that Donald Trump was too old, too chaotic, too \u201cunhinged\u201d and too prone to temper tantrums to be president again and said he couldn\u2019t beat President Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cI feel no need to kiss the ring,\u201d Haley said in February before suspending her primary campaign. \u201cMy political future is of no concern.\u201d\n\nBut on Wednesday, she delivered the implicit endorsement everyone knew was coming sooner or later. Haley said that while Trump had not been \u201cperfect\u201d on issues that matter to her, like foreign policy and the national debt, Biden had been a \u201ccatastrophe.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, I will be voting for Trump,\u201d said the former US ambassador to the United Nations, who served in the ex-president\u2019s Cabinet.\n\nAfter a friendly photo-op in front of the Oval Office fireplace, she left that job in 2018 before she could be tarnished by association with Trump\u2019s mayhem. As 2024 loomed on the calendar, Haley said she would not run for president against her old boss \u2014 then did so anyway \u2014 to Trump\u2019s lingering fury.\n\nBefore losing her home state\u2019s primary to Trump earlier this year, Haley lashed out at Republicans who backed Trump despite privately despairing over him. \u201cIn politics, the herd mentality is enormously strong,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of Republican politicians have surrendered to it. \u2026 Of course, many of the same politicians who now publicly embrace Trump privately dread him. They know what a disaster he\u2019s been and will continue to be for our party. They\u2019re just too afraid to say it out loud.\u201d\n\nNow Haley is saying out loud she\u2019s voting for Trump. But she had little choice but to join the herd if she wants a future in a party dominated by its presumptive nominee. It\u2019s the same decision reached by Ted Cruz, whose wife was once publicly humiliated by Trump but who has long since attached himself to the former president. On Wednesday night, the Harvard Law School graduate, who presently represents Texas in the US Senate, refused an invitation by CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins to unconditionally accept the forthcoming results of the 2024 election.\n\n\u201cLook, if the Democrats win, I will accept the result. But I\u2019m not going to ignore fraud regardless of what happens,\u201d said Cruz, who then, in true Trump fashion, cited baseless claims that the 2020 contest was rife with fraud.\n\nThere\u2019s not much of a path in the alternative: former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, a onetime rising GOP star, became an example of what happens to conservative foreign policy hawks who refuse to temper warnings that Trump is a danger to democracy.\n\nHaley seeks to preserve her future\n\nThere is every sign that Haley wants to run again for president once Trump finally leaves the stage. So repudiating him now would serve no personal political purpose except to end her career on a point of principle. History might applaud her selflessness, but power would likely remain out of her reach.\n\nHaley\u2019s move will reinforce an impression that she always adopts the political course most advantageous to her ambitions. But if Biden wins in November, she can say she predicted Trump would lose. If a Trump second term is a disaster, she\u2019s on the record predicting chaos. She could then be positioned to try to lead the GOP back to the pre-Trump positions on foreign policy and the economy that seem closest to her own beliefs, even if she often seemed in 2024 to be auditioning for the leadership of a party that doesn\u2019t exist in any recognizable form.\n\nFormer Trump national security adviser John Bolton, who has said that Trump should not be let anywhere near the White House again, said he was disappointed by Haley\u2019s decision. \u201cI think she has obviously made a political calculation that it is in her interests to support Donald Trump,\u201d Bolton told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer Wednesday.\n\nHaley \u2013 who won Vermont and Washington, DC \u2013 is not the only younger GOP presidential candidate with still-burning White House dreams to undergo such a transformation. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis lashed out at Trump when his own campaign faded in frigid Iowa in January, then endorsed him on the way out of the race far more quickly than Haley did.\n\nDuring her campaign, Haley argued that both Biden, who is 81, and Trump who turns 78 next month, were both too old to be president and called for cognitive tests for candidates over 75. But her decision to focus only on Biden\u2019s liabilities on Wednesday raises the questions of whether her voters will follow her in Trump\u2019s direction.\n\nSince she suspended her campaign, tens of thousands of voters in GOP primaries have continued to vote for her. This support is a living legacy of a campaign in which she set herself up as a vessel for Republicans who disdain Trump and wanted another candidate. Haley was especially strong in suburban areas where the ex-president struggles most. And the Biden campaign signaled that it would compete for this bloc of wavering GOP voters in November. \u201cThere\u2019s always going to be a place for Haley voters in my campaign,\u201d the president said during a fundraiser in the swing state of Georgia over the weekend.\n\nHowever, many Haley voters confided at events in New Hampshire and Iowa earlier this year that though they preferred her, they\u2019d probably stick with their party as loyal Republicans if Trump beat her to the nomination. In that sense, Haley\u2019s decision \u2013 while dripping with political expedience \u2013 may be one that many of her supporters are also wrestling with.\n\nThe choice for Republicans who dislike Trump and are considering Biden is a more complex question in this election than the previous one. Now, Biden is the incumbent with a list of achievements and policies that directly contradict the core beliefs of many Republicans, including on foreign policy and economics. Memories of the chaos of the Trump administration have also diminished. Traditional national security Republicans may also perceive global war and chaos and Biden\u2019s growing feud with a right-wing Israeli prime minister as a reason not to switch their vote. \u201cA lot of Republicans are making the same calculation because the performance of the Biden administration has been so appalling,\u201d Bolton said.\n\nPolitical ambition behind Haley\u2019s choice\n\nHaley said she\u2019d vote for Trump while speaking at the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank in Washington, during her first major political speech since suspending her Republican presidential campaign.\n\nHer announcement during a Q&A seemed illogical. She had just delivered a hardline speech melding Ronald Reagan\u2019s Cold War hawkishness with the neoconservative notes of the Bush administration yet was promising to vote for an ex-president who has eviscerated both GOP foreign policy codes with his \u201cAmerica First\u201d strategy. Haley argued that she wanted to vote for a candidate who would have \u201cthe backs of our allies and hold our enemies to account and who would secure the border.\u201d But during his first term, Trump often cozied up to US enemies like Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean tyrant Kim Jong Un and spent four years berating US allies in Europe and Asia for freeloading off the United States.\n\nBiden, by contrast, has reinvigorated and expanded US alliances, especially NATO, which Trump despises. The Western alliance now has more direction than at any time since the end of the Cold War. And Trump might talk a good game on immigration, but he recently derailed the most conservative border bill in decades, apparently because he wanted to deprive Biden of an election-year win and preserve his narrative of a nation under siege.\n\nThe tepid nature of Haley\u2019s support for Trump leaves some questions, including whether she will agree to campaign for him and whether she\u2019ll urge her voters to back him. While saying she\u2019d vote for the ex-president, Haley urged him to take steps to reach out to her voters. \u201cTrump would be smart to reach out to the millions of people who voted for me and continue to support me, and not assume that they\u2019re just going to be with him. And I genuinely hope he does that,\u201d she said. Trump has made no effort to appeal to Haley voters during the march to the nomination despite his dire need to court suburban voters. And he was quick to knock down reports recently that the former South Carolina governor could be on his shortlist for the vice presidential nomination.\n\nBut any accommodation between the two political foes would be a reminder that it\u2019s best not to take what happens in presidential primary campaigns too seriously. Haley, after all, went from one extreme to the other during her bid. She spent months offering only the mildest condemnations of Trump, who sought to overturn the 2020 election to stay in power. Like other GOP candidates, she was unable to solve the conundrum of how to run against the ex-president, who is still wildly popular with base voters, while avoiding alienating his supporters. When she did turn fully on Trump amid the snows of New Hampshire, it was as an act of last resort as it became clear she had no route to the nomination.\n\nIn an interview with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on February 1, Haley said Trump had experienced some \u201cconfused moments\u201d in prior days and rebuked the ex-president for a \u201ctemper tantrum\u201d on the night of his New Hampshire primary win when he tried to push her out of the race. During an appearance in Columbia, South Carolina, Haley asked an audience: \u201cDo you really think he is going to win against Joe Biden when he is spending that much on legal fees? He is not.\u201d On February 12, Haley told Tapper that Trump was \u201ccompletely unhinged\u201d and accused the former president of siding with Putin over NATO members.\n\n\u201cRightly or wrongly, chaos follows (Trump),\u201d Haley complained at almost every event. \u201cWe have too much division in this country, and too many threats around the world to be sitting in chaos once again.\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s the \u201cchaos\u201d she\u2019ll be voting for in November.",

Read our privacy policy\n\nA worrying number of Republicans have indicated that they may not accept the outcome of the 2024 presidential election.\n\nThe race is all but certain to be a rematch of the 2020 contest between Joe Biden and Donald Trump, which ended with a clear victory for the Democrat but that Mr Trump refused to accept.\n\nThe outgoing president\u2019s denial sparked months of legal challenges, menacing phone calls and rampant, baseless conspiracy theories about rigged voting machines and lost ballots in support of his spurious narrative that the election had been \u201cstolen\u201d.\n\nopen image in gallery Ted Cruz appeared on CNN in a tense exchange about voter fraud on Wednesday ( CNN )\n\nThe feverish atmosphere boiled over on 6 January 2021 when a mob of Mr Trump\u2019s MAGA supporters stormed the US Capitol, engaging in violent clashes with law enforcement while lawmakers assembled to certify the results fled the legislative complex in fear for their lives.\n\nMr Trump has already alleged that November\u2019s vote may be \u201crigged\u201d, effectively laying the groundwork for further denialism should he lose again.\n\nTrump allies like JD Vance, Lindsey Graham and Dr Ben Carson have said they will accept the outcome of the election so long as it\u2019s \u201cfair\u201d, but a number of fellow prominent GOP members have declined to make a similar commitment. Here\u2019s a look at the Republicans who have signalled they will not accept the results.\n\nElise Stefanik\n\nDuring an interview on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press on 6 January, the New York congresswoman was asked: \u201cWould you vote to certify, and will you vote to certify, the results of the 2024 election no matter what they show?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will see if this is a legal and valid election,\u201d she replied, going on to complain about efforts, then underway, to remove Mr Trump from primary ballot papers in Colorado and Maine citing an anti-insurrectionist clause in the US Constitution.\n\nopen image in gallery New York congresswoman Elise Stefanik complained about \u2018suppression of the American people\u2019 ( AP )\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing so far is that Democrats are so desperate, they\u2019re trying to remove President Trump from the ballot. That is a suppression of the American people.\n\n\u201cAnd the Supreme Court is taking that case up in February \u2013 that should be a nine to zero to allow President Trump to appear on the ballot because that\u2019s the American people\u2019s decision to make this November.\u201d\n\nAsked if that meant she would only accept the results if Mr Trump won, she answered: \u201cNo, it means if they\u2019re constitutional. What we saw in 2020 was unconstitutional circumventing of the constitution, not going through state legislators when it comes to changing election law.\u201d\n\nByron Donalds\n\nThe Florida congressman was interviewed by Axios in March and revealed that if he was Mr Trump\u2019s vice-president and in the same position as Mike Pence found himself on 6 January 2021, he may not act as the former VP did.\n\n\u201cIf you have state officials who are violating the election law in their states... then no, I would not,\u201d Mr Donalds answered, claiming that he \u201cknew\u201d some states did not follow election laws in 2020.\n\nMr Donalds subsequently told Abby Phillip on CNN on 23 May, when the question of accepting this year\u2019s results was put to him: \u201cMy answer is conditional because you want to see the processes of the election go according to law, not according to outside groups and legal cases.\u201d\n\nTim Scott\n\nSpeaking to Meet the Press, South Carolina senator and former primary candidate Tim Scott was asked on 5 May whether he would accept the 2024 results.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, the 47th president of the United States will be President Donald Trump,\u201d he said.\n\nopen image in gallery South Carolina senator Tim Scott can only envisage a Trump victory, he said ( Getty )\n\nPushed for a more emphatic commitment, Mr Scott said simply: \u201cThat is my statement.\u201d\n\nPressed a third time, he repeated: \u201cI look forward to President Trump being the 47th president \u2013 the American people will make the decision.\u201d\n\nDoug Burgum\n\nThe North Dakota governor, who like Mr Scott is a possible running mate for Mr Trump, took a similar line on 5 May.\n\nHe dodged the question on CNN and said that he was \u201clooking forward to next January when Vice-President Harris certifies the election for Donald Trump\u201d.\n\nHe continued: \u201cI mean, the American people are the ones that get to decide these elections, but for both parties and for all Americans, we\u2019ve got to make sure that every county, every precinct is beyond reproach, that everybody can be confident in our country.\u201d\n\nMarco Rubio\n\nAppearing on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press on 19 May, the Florida senator \u2013 once derided by Mr Trump as \u201cLittle Marco\u201d but who now says he would be \u201chonored\u201d to be the presumptive GOP nominee\u2019s VP \u2013 was asked if we would accept the election results of 2024 \u201cno matter what happens\u201d.\n\n\u201cNo matter what happens? No, if it\u2019s an unfair election,\u201d Senator Rubio answered.\n\n\u201cSenator, no matter who wins,\u201d host Kristen Welker persisted.\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019re asking the wrong person,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Democrats are the ones who have opposed every Republican victory since 2000.\u201d\n\nTed Cruz\n\nThe Texas senator got into a tense exchange with CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins on 22 May after she asked him point blank whether he would accept the results of the 2024 presidential election.\n\nMr Cruz called the question \u201cridiculous\u201d, then went on to argue that there was voter fraud in 2020, even if it was not enough to change the outcome of the vote.\n\n\u201cIf the Democrats win, I will accept the result but I\u2019m not going to ignore fraud regardless of what happens,\u201d he added.\n\nIn the same interview, he insisted that Mr Trump \u201cdidn\u2019t\u201d attempt to block the peaceful transfer of power between him and Mr Biden, arguing that the ex-president went quietly (after the conclusion of the Capitol riot).",

        "text": "Trump\u2019s Pattern of Sowing Election Doubt Intensifies in 2024\nTrump\u2019s Pattern of Sowing Election Doubt Intensifies in 2024\n\nFormer President Donald J. Trump has baselessly and publicly cast doubt about the fairness of the 2024 election about once a day, on average, since he announced his candidacy for president, according to an analysis by The New York Times.\n\nThough the tactic is familiar \u2014 Mr. Trump raised the specter of a \u201crigged\u201d election in the 2016 and 2020 cycles, too \u2014 his attempts to undermine the 2024 contest are a significant escalation.\n\nA line chart shows the number of times Donald J. Trump cast doubt on the fairness or integrity of the election during the 2016, 2020, and 2024 election cycles. The line for 2024 shows that Trump started casting doubt months earlier during this election cycle and has made hundreds more statements than in past elections. Three videos on the chart show early instances of Trump casting doubt, in 2016, 2019 and 2022. Mr. Trump first raised questions about the 2016 election in August of that year, about 100 days before the election. Aug. 21, 2016 He did so earlier \u2014 and more frequently \u2014 before the 2020 election. June 26, 2019 But in the 2024 cycle, the falsehoods have been baked in since Mr. Trump announced his candidacy, almost two years before Election Day. They show no signs of subsiding. Nov. 18, 2022\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s refusal to accept the results of the 2020 election had historic consequences. The so-called \u201cBig Lie\u201d \u2014 Mr. Trump\u2019s false claim that the election was stolen from him \u2014 led to the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the United States Capitol and two of four criminal indictments against Mr. Trump, as well as his second impeachment.\n\nBut Mr. Trump had planted seeds of doubt among his followers long before Election Day, essentially setting up a no-lose future for himself: Either he would prevail, or the election would be rigged.\n\nHe has never given up that framing, which no evidence supports, even well after the end of his presidency. And as he seeks to return to the White House, the same claim has become the backbone of his campaign.\n\nLong before announcing his candidacy, Mr. Trump and his supporters had been falsely claiming that President Biden was \u201cweaponizing\u201d the Justice Department to target him. But it took until March of last year for Mr. Trump to settle on a new accusation: that the multiple legal challenges related to Mr. Trump\u2019s business and political activities constituted a \u201cnew way of cheating\u201d in order to \u201cinterfere\u201d in the 2024 election. He has made versions of that accusation more than 350 times.\n\n\u201cThis is a rigged deal, just as the 2020 election was rigged, and we can\u2019t let them get away with it,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Nov. 18, 2022, three days after announcing his 2024 candidacy. His comments were in response to Attorney General Merrick B. Garland\u2019s appointment of a special counsel to supervise the Justice Department\u2019s criminal investigations related to the events leading up to the Jan. 6 riot and Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to keep classified documents at his Florida resort.\n\nBy last summer, Mr. Trump had honed the language and made it a staple of his stump speech: \u201cThey rigged the presidential election of 2020, and we\u2019re not going to allow them to rig the presidential election of 2024.\u201d\n\nThe Times has documented more than 500 campaign events, social media posts and interviews during the 2024 cycle in which Mr. Trump falsely accused Democrats or others of trying to \u201crig,\u201d \u201ccheat,\u201d \u201csteal\u201d or otherwise \u201cinfluence\u201d the next election \u2014 or of having done so in 2020.\n\n\u2018Election interference\u2019 is Trump\u2019s choice accusation in 2024 cycle Mentions of rigging or similar words Mentions of election interference or similar words Mentions of both Trial started in hush-money case Trump charged in classified documents case Trump charged in Jan. 6 and Georgia election interference cases Trump charged in Manhattan hush-money case WEEK TRUMP ANNOUNCED 2024 CAMPAIGN LAST WEEK Mentions of rigging or similar words Mentions of election interference or similar words Mentions of both Trump charged in classified documents case Trump charged in Jan. 6 and Georgia election interference cases Trial started in hush-money case Trump charged in Manhattan hush-money case WEEK TRUMP ANNOUNCED 2024 CAMPAIGN LAST WEEK Mentions of rigging or similar words Mentions of election interference or similar words Mentions of both Week Trump announced 2024 campaign Trump charged in Manhattan hush- money case Trump charged in classified documents case Trump charged in Jan. 6 and Georgia election interference cases Trial started in hush-money case Last week\n\nMr. Trump has adapted the specifics of his accusations with each of the three election cycles. But in each case, his pattern of discourse has followed the same contours. He sows doubt about the legitimacy of the election, and then begins to capitalize on that doubt by alluding to not necessarily accepting the election results \u2014 unless, of course, he wins.\n\nThis rhetorical strategy \u2014 heads, I win; tails, you cheated \u2014 is a beloved one for Mr. Trump that predates even his time as a presidential candidate. He called the Emmy Awards \u201ca con game\u201d after his television show \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d failed to win in 2004 and 2005. And before he officially became the Republican presidential nominee in 2016, he began to float the possibility that the primary contest was, as he said, \u201crigged and boss controlled.\u201d\n\nBy May of that year, Mr. Trump spoke plainly about why he had stashed the argument away. \u201cYou\u2019ve been hearing me say it\u2019s a rigged system,\u201d he said, \u201cbut now I don\u2019t say it anymore because I won.\u201d\n\nLate that summer, with his sights set on the November general election, Mr. Trump tested out a new line, contending that \u201cthe media\u201d was \u201crigging\u201d the election in favor of Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee. His assertions intensified in October after a recording surfaced of him speaking in vulgar terms about women.\n\n\u201cI will totally accept the results of this great and historic presidential election \u2014 if I win,\u201d Mr. Trump said at a rally in 2016, three weeks before Election Day. And though he would end up winning the Electoral College and the presidency, his failure to secure the popular vote led him to form a Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity to \u201cprove\u201d that rampant voter fraud was to blame.\n\nIn December 2019, well into Mr. Trump\u2019s re-election campaign, the Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives impeached him, saying he used the levers of government to solicit election assistance from Ukraine in the form of investigations to discredit Mr. Biden. Mr. Trump subsequently said that Democrats were using the \u201cimpeachment hoax\u201d to \u201cinterfere\u201d in the election.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic gave him a new rallying cry, centered on election integrity: Mail-in ballots were \u201cdangerous,\u201d \u201cfraught with fraud\u201d and were being used to \u201csteal\u201d and \u201crig\u201d the election, he said.\n\nAbout six weeks before Election Day in 2020, Mr. Trump refused to commit to a peaceful transfer of power. \u201cWe want to make sure that the election is honest, and I\u2019m not sure that it can be,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\nThis time, it was half a year before Election Day 2024 \u2014 and after more than a year of pushing the \u201celection interference\u201d line about the criminal charges against him and repeatedly warning that Democrats are \u201ccheating\u201d \u2014 that Mr. Trump again placed conditions on his acceptance of election results.\n\n\u201cIf everything\u2019s honest, I\u2019ll gladly accept the results,\u201d he said in a May 1 interview with The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. \u201cIf it\u2019s not, you have to fight for the right of the country.\u201d",

It's just a matter of how escalatory it is,\" one US intelligence official added.\n\nFollowing the NBC News report, a campaign spokesperson for Donald Trump said, \"The only 'October surprise' will be the look of shock\" among reporters when Trump is reelected.\n\nThe officials' warning comes ahead of a likely meeting between North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un and Putin, which the Kremlin announced earlier this week was \"being prepared.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"President Putin has an active invitation for an official visit to North Korea. The visit is being prepared. We will announce the dates of the trip in due course,\" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Friday, French news agency AFP reported.\n\nRussia and North Korea have developed closer relations since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nFor its part, North Korea has sent munitions to Moscow, ostensibly to help Putin's forces in their war against Ukraine, but also to take advantage of the opportunity to test its equipment on the battlefield, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn return, North Korea \"expects Russia to provide advanced weapons systems and technological know-how to significantly strengthen its defense, nuclear, and space programs,\" the think tank said.\n\nThe six US officials also told NBC News that the Biden administration was concerned that the relationship could lead to significant developments in Pyongyang's nuclear capabilities, increasing tensions in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nHowever, one official said that China likely does not want instability in the region, and Russia might, therefore, hesitate to get involved ahead of the US election.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNevertheless, Rachel Minyoung Lee, a Senior Fellow with the 38 North Program at the Stimson Center, expressed concern that North Korea's strengthening ties with Russia could \"embolden\" Kim to conduct more aggressive military or diplomatic action in the coming years.\n\nNorth Korea's new \"tactical nuclear attack submarine\" at its launch ceremony in 2023. KCNA via REUTERS\n\nNorth Korea has already sent a significant amount of military aid to Russia.\n\nBy November 2023, one South Korean lawmaker said North Korea had sent Moscow more than 1 million artillery shells to bolster its war effort.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut earlier this month, the office of Ukraine's top prosecutor, Andriy Kostin, told Reuters that North Korean-supplied weapons appeared to have a high failure rate.\n\n\"About half of the North Korean missiles lost their programmed trajectories and exploded in the air; in such cases the debris was not recovered,\" Kostin's office said, citing their examination of debris from 21 of around 50 North Korean-supplied ballistic missiles launched by Russia between late December and late February.",

        "text": "Trump holds a rally in the South Bronx as he tries to woo his hometown\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Former President Donald Trump has campaigned in one of the most Democratic counties in the nation, holding a rally in the South Bronx as he tries to woo minority voters days before a Manhattan jury will begin deliberations on whether to convict him of felony charges in his criminal hush money trial.\n\nTrump on Thursday addressed supporters in Crotona Park, a public green space in a neighborhood that is among the city\u2019s most diverse and its most impoverished, a change from the majority-white areas where the Republican holds most of his rallies. While the crowd was not quite as diverse as the South Bronx as a whole, it included large numbers of Black and Hispanic voters, and Spanish was heard throughout the crowd.\n\nTrump, in his speech, cast himself as a better president for Black and Hispanic voters than President Joe Biden as he railed against Biden on immigration, an issue Trump has made central to his campaign. He insisted \u201cthe biggest negative impact\u201d of the influx of migrants in New York is \u201cagainst our Black population and our Hispanic population who are losing their jobs, losing their housing, losing everything they can lose.\u201d\n\nSome in the crowd responded by chanting, \u201cBuild the wall,\u201d a reference to Trump\u2019s push while in the White House to build a U.S.-Mexico border barrier.\n\nWhat to know about Trump\u2019s second term:\n\nStaffing the administration: Here are the people Trump has picked recess appointments Follow all of our coverage as Donald Trump assembles his second administration.\n\nWith Trump confined to New York for much of the last six weeks because of his trial, the presumptive Republican nominee\u2019s campaign has planned a series of local stops across his hometown before and after court. He visited a bodega in Harlem, dropped by a construction site and held a photo op at a local firehouse.\n\nBut the Bronx rally was his first event open to the general public as he insists he is making a play to win an overwhelmingly Democratic state that hasn\u2019t backed a Republican for president since Ronald Reagan in 1984. Besides creating a spectacle of rallygoers and protesters, the rally also gave Trump an opportunity to highlight what he argues are advantages on economic and immigration issues that could cut into key Democratic voting blocs.\n\n\u201cThe strategy is to demonstrate to the voters of the Bronx and New York that this isn\u2019t your typical presidential election, that Donald Trump is here to represent everybody and get our country back on track,\u201d said Florida Republican Rep. Byron Donalds, a potential Trump running mate who grew up in Brooklyn.\n\nThe former president opened his rally with an ode to his hometown, talking about its humble beginnings as a small Dutch trading post before becoming a glamorous capital of culture that \u201cinspired the entire world.\u201d While Trump established residency in Florida in 2019, he reminisced on Thursday about his efforts to revitalize Central Park\u2019s Wollman Rink and people he knew in the real estate business.\n\n\u201cEveryone wanted to be here,\u201d he told the enthusiastic audience. \u201cBut sadly this is now a city in decline.\u201d\n\nFormer President Donald Trump speaks at a rally, Thursday, May 23, 2024, in the Bronx borough of New York.

Ruben Diaz Sr., a former New York City Council member. He also brought up the local rappers Sheff G and Sleepy Hallow, who were indicted last year in a wide-ranging case that includes allegations of attempted murder by the Brooklyn district attorney\u2019s office.\n\nHours before Trump\u2019s rally was set to begin, a long line of supporters decked out in red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats and other Trump gear snaked around the park, waiting for security screening to begin. People were still entering the park well into Trump\u2019s speech, with some eager supporters sprinting up a hill toward the rally site after getting through security.\n\nThe Bronx Democratic Party protested Trump\u2019s appearance with its own event at the park.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump arrives at a rally, Thursday, May 23, 2024, in the Bronx borough of New York.

Amanda Septimo, who represents the South Bronx. \u201cThey talk about the Bronx and everything that\u2019s wrong with it, but they never get to the part that talks about what they\u2019re going to do for the Bronx and we know that Trump is never going to get to that part in his speech.\u201d\n\nBut some locals in the crowd Thursday disagreed.\n\nMargarita Rosario, a 69-year-old who has lived in the borough for over 60 years, said she saw Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York on television the night before suggesting that the Bronx wouldn\u2019t support Trump. It spurred her to show up, holding a Trump flag and a poster that said, \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d\n\n\u201cI got so annoyed with that. I said, \u2018How dare she speak for the whole Bronx?\u2019\u201d Rosario said.\n\nMuhammad Ali, a 50-year-old who lives in the Bronx and said he planned to vote for Trump in November, said he once used to think the former president was a racist but his views have changed.\n\n\u201cWe need a patriotic president at the moment and I find Donald Trump more patriotic for the moment than Joe Biden,\u201d said Ali, an immigrant from Bangladesh and worker for New York\u2019s transportation agency.\n\nAt least one New Yorker in the crowd said he knew Trump from his days as a local billionaire real estate developer.\n\nAlfredo Rosado, 62, said he\u2019d been a Trump supporter since 1998 when he worked for several months as a fill-in summer doorman at Trump\u2019s Trump Tower building.\n\nRosado recounted how Trump had asked his name and stopped to chat. \u201cHe\u2019s the same person you see,\u201d he said of the former president.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign believes he can chip away at Biden\u2019s support among Black and Hispanic voters, particularly younger men who may not follow politics closely, but are frustrated by their economic situations and drawn to Trump\u2019s tough-guy persona.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump speaks at a rally, Thursday, May 23, 2024, in the Bronx borough of New York.

A radio ad fictionalizing a conversation between a Trump campaign volunteer and a Black voter will air on national Black radio stations while a shorter television spot will air in major cities, in swing states and on digital platforms, aiming to reach voters in the Bronx near Trump\u2019s rally.\n\nThe rally comes during a pause in Trump\u2019s criminal hush money trial. Court will resume following the Memorial Day weekend with closing arguments. The jury will then decide whether Trump will become the first former president in the nation\u2019s history to be criminally convicted and whether he will be the first major party presidential candidate to run as a convicted felon.\n\nThe Bronx was once the most Democratic borough in the city. Barack Obama won 91.2% of the borough\u2019s vote in 2012, the highest in the state. Biden won 83.5% of the borough in 2020. Trump garnered only 16% of the vote.\n\nThe area Trump visited is overwhelmingly non-white \u2014 a departure from most of his rally locations. About 65% of residents are Hispanic and 31% Black, according to the U.S. Census data. About 35% live below the poverty line.\n\nAs he wrapped up his speech, Trump said he woke up Thursday uncertain of the reception he\u2019d get in the Bronx.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018I wonder, will it be hostile or will it be friendly?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt was beyond friendly. It was a lovefest.\u201d\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show the rappers were charged last year, not this month.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Zeke Miller in Washington and Liset Cruz in New York contributed to this report.",

        "text": "Governor's races to watch in 2024: North Carolina, New Hampshire and Washington\nWhile the U.S. presidential election will feature a rematch between Biden and Trump, there are several high-profile races, including 11 governor's seats, to watch in November's general election. The majority of the gubernatorial races feature new candidates, giving fresh faces the chance to occupy the governor's mansion in eight states. Here's a look at three state races that USA Today is closely monitoring.\n\nWho's running for North Carolina governor?\n\nThe Tar Heel State's gubernatorial race is at the top of everyone's watch lists, and for good reason. North Carolina is a swing state rife with contradictions and surprises. Exiting Democratic governor Roy Cooper has stood in stark contrast to the state's deeply Republican legislature for the past eight years, winning the statewide vote in 2016 and 2020, while the state itself voted for Donald Trump.\n\nSign up for Your Vote: Text USA TODAY reporters and the elections team by joining our SMS service.\n\nThe state's diversity, rapid population growth, and complex political legacy, ranging from Jesse Helms to Jim Hunt, will all come into play this November. But the scrutiny isn't just due to North Carolina's swing-state status - the contest features a showdown between two heavyweights of the state's political scene, Democratic Attorney General Josh Stein and Republican Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson. Millions of dollars are already pouring into the race.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nStein is hoping to ride on Governor Cooper's popularity and continue the Democratic Party's long-held dominance of the state's governorship. Much of the national attention on the race is attributable to Robinson, who has made controversial remarks on topics including abortion, gun rights, and LGBTQ issues, with none of the scandals seeming to slow his momentum.\n\nWho's running for governor in New Hampshire?\n\nThe impending retirement of New Hampshire's longtime Republican governor Chris Sununu gives Democrats a chance to take the governor's mansion in the famously libertarian state. The moderate Sununu's popularity repeatedly foiled Democrats' attempts to claim the governorship.\n\nThe Granite State's gubernatorial primaries are not until September. On the Democratic side, the front-runners are former Manchester Mayor Joyce Craig and New Hampshire Executive Councilor Cinde Warmington, with restaurant owner and author Jonathan Kiper announcing their candidacy as well. On the Republican side, Former U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte faces former state Senate President Chuck Morse lead the pack, with Make America Jesus Included founder Shaun Fife in the mix as well.\n\nWho's running for governor in Washington?\n\nThe impending retirement of longtime governor Democrat Jay Inslee has left an opening for Republicans to take the governorship in the Democratic stronghold - Biden won the state by 19 points in 2020.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nThe Republican Party's hope is largely pinned on the familiar name of Dave Reichert, a moderate Republican who represented Washington for 14 years in a district that leans Democratic. Presently, 28 candidates have filed to compete in Washington's nonpartisan gubernatorial primary. Reichert's most significant challenge across the aisle will be Democratic Attorney General Bob Ferguson. Other notable contenders include retired veteran Republican Semi Bird and Democratic state Senator Mark Mullett.\n\nAs reported by the Kitsap Sun, the race has already seen plenty of mischief. A local conservative activist contacted some of Washington's 53 residents named Bob Ferguson, and ultimately helped two of the Bobs to file for August's Democratic primary, including paying each of the candidate's nearly $2,000 filing fees. Both alternate Bob Fergusons exited the race after the original Bob, Attorney General Bob Ferguson, sent cease and desist letters and threatened prosecution.\n\nCy Neff reports on Wyoming politics for USA Today.

        "text": "Top Republicans are already rushing to buy into Trump\u2019s 2024 election fraud narrative\nWashington CNN \u2014\n\nTop Republicans are already rushing to buy into a new 2024 election fraud narrative sown by ex-President Donald Trump in their zeal to appease their party\u2019s presumptive nominee.\n\nLeading party figures are increasingly warning they will only recognize the result of November\u2019s presidential vote if there is no fraud. But there is no indication that there will be irregularities in the election. And their warnings come despite many Republican state legislatures taking steps to tighten voting rules \u2014 based on Trump\u2019s lies about fraud in 2020.\n\nThe new Republican trend of casting doubt on the integrity of the 2024 election in advance was exhibited by Sen. Ted Cruz on Wednesday in an interview with CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins. The Texas lawmaker, who in 2016 fell in line behind Trump despite the ex-president\u2019s insults about his father and his wife, falsely stated that the 2020 election was tainted by fraud. Despite Trump\u2019s claims of voting irregularities, multiple courts, including the US Supreme Court, rejected the former president\u2019s claims he was cheated out of power. And Trump\u2019s then-attorney general, William Barr, looked into his claims and decided that there was no widespread fraud that would have changed the result of the election.\n\nBut Cruz told Collins that a question about whether he would accept the results of the 2024 election was \u201cridiculous.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re asking, \u2018Will you promise, no matter what, to agree an election is legitimate regardless of what happens?,\u2019 and that would be an absurd thing to claim,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cWe have an entire election law system: that people challenge elections, elections get overturned, voter fraud gets proven. That happens all the time.\u201d Cruz, who objected to election results in Arizona, which Trump narrowly lost to Biden, on January 6, 2021, went on to suggest there was significant fraud in 2020. And he implied the same could happen this year.\n\n\u201cIf the Democrats win, I will accept the result, but I\u2019m not going to ignore fraud regardless of what happens,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nA sign of Trump\u2019s power\n\nThe equivocating of senior Republicans appears motivated by a fear of crossing Trump, the twice-impeached GOP leader who has the power to end careers in the party simply by turning against an individual lawmaker. The positioning looks a lot like laying the groundwork for a challenge to the fairness of the 2024 election if Trump loses in November. Undermining an election even before it happens represents a grave threat to democracy.\n\nThe attempt to raise the specter of election fraud this year is especially corrosive because of the likelihood that the 2024 vote will be decided in a handful of swing states by mere thousands of ballots and raises the possibility of prolonged legal action by Trump\u2019s camp that would tarnish yet another US election. Trump is still claiming falsely that Mike Pence had the constitutional authority power to overturn the 2020 election result, and the former vice president has been largely ostracized within his party for following the Constitution and overseeing the certification of Biden\u2019s victory.\n\nCruz is just one of the latest senior party figures to try to avoid getting on the wrong side of Trump when asked whether they will accept the result of the 2024 election. The attempt to win Trump\u2019s favor follows an interview that Trump gave to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel newspaper earlier this month. \u201cIf everything\u2019s honest, I\u2019ll gladly accept the results. I don\u2019t change on that,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIf it\u2019s not, you have to fight for the right of the country.\u201d His comments carried the implicit threat that he will decide if he loses, as he did in 2020, that the election was not fair. Trump frequently claims he did better in the popular vote four years ago than any incumbent president, creating a false argument that it was therefore impossible to lose to Biden, who got more votes.\n\nTrump\u2019s renewed election denialism is disturbing for several reasons. First, it mirrors his pre-election spin in 2020, when he suggested that the election might not be fair \u2014 which he later built upon after losing to Biden with a widespread campaign that culminated in the mob attack by his supporters on the Capitol that was designed to thwart the certification of Biden\u2019s victory. Trump often leaves the impression that any election he loses cannot, by definition, be legitimate. His false claims about election fraud in 2020 are now believed by millions of Republican voters despite the fact that he has been indicted twice \u2014 in a federal case and in Georgia \u2014 for his attempts to steal the election and stay in power.\n\nComments like Cruz\u2019s on Wednesday serve to create an expectation among some voters that the coming election will not be fair, even though there is no indication that this, or any other US election, will be tarnished by fraud, which historically has only taken place at very low levels.\n\nRepublican senators try to demonstrate loyalty to Trump\n\nThe Texas senator is far from the only senior party figure to buy into Trump\u2019s claims, a trend that shows the sheer power of Trump in the GOP. It also follows the announcement by former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley on Wednesday that she will vote for Trump despite having called him \u201cunhinged\u201d and unfit to serve in the Oval Office again during her primary campaign earlier this year. Her move appeared to be an attempt to retain viability in the Republican Party for any future run for president.\n\nIt seems like it should be easy for Republicans just to state that they will accept the result of the 2024 election and that US presidential votes in the modern era have not been tainted by fraud. But they can\u2019t seem to do it.\n\nFormer Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, whom Trump mentioned as a possible vice presidential contender on Thursday, said on CNN the same night, \u201cI will accept the results if it\u2019s done in a fair and transparent way,\u201d going on to raise doubts about mail-in voting.\n\nAlso on CNN Thursday night, Florida Rep. Byron Donalds \u2014 who\u2019s also been mentioned as a possible Trump running mate \u2014 was asked if he\u2019d accept the results if Trump loses. \u201cIf the states and localities actually follow the rules and procedures and everybody sees the rules followed, then of course, you accept what\u2019s done,\u201d Donalds said.\n\nEarlier this week, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who ran against Trump in 2016 but has since adopted Trumpian positions, was asked Sunday on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d whether he would accept the result of the election \u201cno matter what happens.\u201d He replied: \u201cIf it\u2019s an unfair election, I think it\u2019s going to be contested by either side.\u201d He claimed that Democrats have \u201copposed every Republican victory since 2000\u201d and added: \u201cIf it\u2019s unfair, we are going to do the same thing Democrats do \u2026 we\u2019re going to use lawyers to go to court and point out the fact that states are not following their own election laws.\u201d\n\nRubio\u2019s comment is misleading because, while there were some claims by small groups of Democrats that the elections of 2004 and 2016 featured some fraud, the Democratic candidates in each case quickly conceded to Republicans, unlike Trump, who has never accepted that he lost. The 2000 election was contested by Republicans and Democrats over a recount controversy in Florida, the pivotal state. The Democratic candidate, then-Vice President Al Gore, eventually conceded after the case was adjudicated by the Supreme Court \u2014 a step that Trump never took as he sought to disrupt the American tradition of peaceful transfers of power.\n\nThe idea that the 2024 election may not be free and fair was also raised recently by Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, who is reported to be on Trump\u2019s shortlist as a potential vice presidential nominee. He told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash on \u201cState of the Union\u201d earlier this month that \u201cI totally plan to accept the results of 2024,\u201d while holding out the possibility that the election may not be fair if Trump were to lose.\n\n\u201cI think that Donald Trump will be (the victor). And if it\u2019s a free and fair election, Dana, I think every Republican will enthusiastically accept the results. And, again, I think those results will show that Donald Trump has been elected president, been reelected president.\u201d\n\nVance argued that parties in the election had to be willing to prosecute their cases if they believed there was election fraud. But academic studies and multiple legal cases have shown that fraud in presidential elections only occurs in isolated cases. That\u2019s not stopping Republicans demonstrating their loyalty to Trump by casting doubt on the integrity of the 2024 election before it even happens.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.",

It has a market cap of 148.84 billion, according to Yahoo Finance. It also assets under management of more than $1 trillion. Schwarzman is the Chairman, CEO, and Co-founder of Blackstone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSchwarzman to vote for \u2018change\u2019 amid rising antisemitism\n\nSchwarzman told Axios that he will vote for Trump to seek a \u201cchange\u201d. He added that rising antisemitism in the United States has also shaped his decision.\n\nSchwarzman said, \u201cThe dramatic rise of antisemitism has led me to focus on the consequences of upcoming elections with greater urgency.\u201d\n\nSchwarzman further said that the US under President Joe Biden was heading in the \u201cwrong direction\u201d.\n\n\u201cI share the concern of most Americans that our economic, immigration, and foreign policies are taking the country in the wrong direction. For these reasons, I am planning to vote for change and support Donald Trump for President. In addition, I will be supporting Republican Senate candidates and other Republicans up and down the ticket,\u201d said Schwarzman.\n\nEven though Schwarzman has endorsed Trump, Axios noted that Blackstone as a company remains bipartisan. John Gay, the Chief Operating Officer (COO), President, and heir-apparent of Blackstone, has endorsed Biden and is a major donor to the Democratic Party. Similarly, Tom Nides, a former US envoy to Israel under the Biden administration, serves as the Vice Chairman for Strategy and Client Relations at Blackstone.\n\nSilicon Valley investors turning against Biden: Report\n\nThe news of Blackstone boss Schwarzman endorsing Biden has come at a time when Silicon Valley investors are also reportedly turning against Biden.\n\nFor his hardliner policies, incendiary rhetoric, and the incitement to a mob on January 6, 2021 that attacked the US Capitol, Trump was long avoided by the Silicon Valley and the US corporate world, but that now appears to be changing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProminent Silicon Valley venture capitalists David Sacks and Chamath Palihapitiya have already announced support for Trump and a fund-raiser for him, according to The New York Times. Moreover, even those who may not be openly endorsing Trump are dissing Biden.\n\nThe report said that Marc Andreessen of Andreessen Horowitz and Shaun Maguire of Sequoia Capital have criticised Biden but have stopped short of supporting Trump. Meanwhile, Keith Rabois of Khosla Ventures is focusing on electing Republicans to Congress.",

Here's what new poll says\nDonald Trump on Thursday received an overwhelming response in a campaign rally in deep-blue South Bronx. And now a new poll shows that the former president is successfully closing the gap with incumbent Joe Biden in New York. Republican presidential candidate and former U.S. President Donald Trump (REUTERS)\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, Trump received only 16 percent of the votes in the Bronx in the 2020 presidential election, whereas Biden received more than 80 percent. Ahead of the upcoming elections, Trump and Republicans have put all their efforts to get the support of Black and Hispanic voters.\n\nIn fact, Trump's campaign and conservative followers in New York are optimistic that the former president will do well in the borough and across the state in an anticipated rematch with Biden. While 65 percent of the Bronx population are Hispanic, nearly 31 percent are Black.\n\nAddressing the Bronx rallygoers, Trump, who was born and raised in New York, assertedthat he was confident he could win the state.\n\n\"I believe that we can win New York State, Don't assume, it doesn't matter just because you live in a blue city. You live in a blue city, but it's going red very, very quickly,\" he said.\n\nAlso Read: \u2018It was a lovefest\u2019, Donald Trump claims \u2018winning over\u2019 Democrat bastion of South Bronx with huge turnout\n\nHere's what new poll says\n\nAccording to a Siena College poll of 1,191 registered voters conducted between May 13 and 15, Biden trails Trump in New York by nine points, 47 percent to 38 percent.

The President and his team have been meeting with CEOs and business leaders, including Target CEO Brian Cornell, to discuss the elevated costs that families face. Target, Walmart, and other grocery chains have begun to answer the President\u2019s call to lower prices for household goods.\n\nWhile Congressional Republicans side with special interests to keep prices high for consumers, President Biden is calling out price gouging and calling on other big corporations to join leaders like Target and Walmart to lower prices and give families more breathing room.\n\nRead more below:\n\nNBC News: Target lowering prices on 5,000 frequently bought items\n\n[Rob Wile, 5/20/24]\n\nTarget said Monday it will lower prices on approximately 5,000 frequently bought items as it seeks to stay competitive amid signs consumers are experiencing price fatigue.\n\nThe company said in a statement that the price cuts are concentrated in grocery staples like milk, meat, bread, fruit and vegetables, as well as paper towels and diapers, with many cuts affecting its company-owned Good & Gather and Everspring brands.\n\nIt had already cut prices on some 1,500 other items.\n\nWashington Post: Grocers are finally lowering prices as consumers pull back\n\n[Jaclyn Peiser, 5/23/24]\n\nIn recent weeks, Target and Aldi have broadcast price cuts on thousands of items, while Walmart unveiled a new private label lineup of quality \u201cchef-inspired food\u201d mostly in the $5-and-under range. [\u2026]\n\nThis week, Target announced it would lower prices on roughly 5,000 items, including staples such as milk, produce, bread and coffee, as well as diapers and pet food. The reductions will \u201ccollectively save consumers millions of dollars this summer,\u201d the company said in a news release.\n\nThe White House \u2014 which has been pressing retailers to lower prices \u2014 took credit for the rollbacks, posting on X: \u201cPresident Biden called on grocery chains making record profits to lower prices for consumers \u2014 and they\u2019re answering the call.\u201d\n\nSince the pandemic, the major chains have been operating at the highest profit margins on groceries in two decades, according to a study by the White House Council of Economic Advisers. An array of federal regulators, Democratic lawmakers and think tanks contend that large retailers have kept prices artificially high, allegedly through coercive tactics like price fixing and price gouging, and industry consolidation.\n\nCNN: Walmart and Target are slashing prices. What does that mean for inflation?\n\n[Crystal Hur, 5/23/24]\n\nAmericans might be noticing markdowns for some everyday essentials during their weekly grocery runs. That doesn\u2019t mean the battle against inflation is won. [\u2026]\n\nNow Walmart is taking things one step further. The superstore said on May 16 that it has rolled back prices on nearly 7,000 items in its stores, noting deflationary trends in general merchandise. Inflation during the first quarter increased at half the rate seen last year, it added. [\u2026]\n\nOn Monday, Target slashed prices on more than 1,500 items, ranging from laundry detergent to cat food to sunscreen, with thousands more price cuts expected over the summer. For example, the price of a pack of 16 Huggies baby wipes fell to 99 cents from $1.19 and roasted nuts from the Good & Gather brand now cost $5.29 from $6.89, according to a press release. [\u2026]\n\nOther retailers including Ikea and Aldi have also reduced prices in recent months.\n\nUSA Today: Target latest retailer to start cutting prices for summer, with reductions on 5,000 items\n\n[Emilee Coblentz, 5/20/24]\n\nTarget announced today that around 5,000 of its frequently shopped items will see prices reduced in the coming weeks. The prices on about 1,500 items have already been cut, and all the remaining price changes will be in place by the end of the summer.\n\n\u201cThese price reductions will collectively save consumers millions of dollars this summer,\u201d Target said in a news release, but it\u2019s also a way for the retailer to stay competitive within the market.\n\nAmong the items discounted will be food products, Memorial Day items, things for Fourth of July fun and of course, back-to-school gear.\n\nMoney: Target Is the Latest Store to Go on a Price-Slashing Spree\n\n[Adam Hardy, 5/21/24]\n\nThe box-store behemoth said Monday that it has already slashed prices on 1,500 popular products, including many grocery staples, with \u201cthousands more price cuts\u201d planned for the summer. In total, about 5,000 products will be discounted once the plan is in full effect.\n\nABC News: Aldi stores focusing on low grocery prices this summer, CEO says\n\n[Yi-Jin Yu, 5/23/24]\n\nEarlier this month, Aldi announced it would cut prices on over 250 summer essentials, including barbecue basics like chicken and steak and other family favorites like frozen blueberries and granola bars.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s focused on, as you can imagine, fresh meat, snacks for the summer road trip and our fresh meat prices are lower than they were last year and our sales are up 30%,\u201d Hart said, adding that low prices are part of the \u201cDNA\u201d of Aldi. \u201cWe\u2019ve got our boneless, skinless chicken breasts at $2.19 a pound. Since we\u2019ve marked that product down, it\u2019s up 50% in movement and that\u2019s just showing the popularity of low prices and the popularity of Aldi is as high as it\u2019s ever been.\u201d\n\n###",

Not anymore. Campaigns must start sooner.\n\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\n\nNot so many years ago, it was traditional for political pros to say the presidential campaign begins after Labor Day in September. People don't say that anymore. Campaigns must start sooner. President Biden and former President Trump acknowledged this reality by scheduling a debate for this June 27. And that is the headline for this story. The decisive part of the election is not this fall. It's this summer. It's now. NPR senior political correspondent Domenico Montanaro is tracking the changing political calendar. Domenico, good morning.\n\nDOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hey. Good morning.\n\nINSKEEP: What's driving the change?\n\nMONTANARO: Well, a big part of that is early voting. I mean, the vast majority of states offer some ability to vote early. Many voters will begin casting ballots just days after the second presidential debate, which is scheduled for September 10. You know, that's a reason that the Biden campaign actually wanted it then. And because of how many people are voting early, the stakes are pretty high to start campaigning, fundraising and advertising earlier than ever. I talked with Mo Elleithee, a veteran of Democratic presidential politics, and here's what he had to say.\n\nMO ELLEITHEE: We don't have election days anymore. We have election month. And it's really forced candidates and campaigns to rethink the cadence of how they campaign, as well as how they allocate resources. So there's no question that if you're waiting for the starting gun to go off on Labor Day, you've already missed half the race.\n\nMONTANARO: Speaking of half, half or more of all votes this year are expected to be cast early.\n\nINSKEEP: Wow. OK, so we already mentioned the earlier debates than ever before. How else is this affecting the campaigns?\n\nMONTANARO: Well, it's having a pretty big impact. I mean, these are two well-known candidates. They're not very well-liked. This is the longest general election in history. And the campaigns are facing a lot of voter malaise, you know? So the campaigns know they need to get voters paying attention and engaged. The Biden campaign in particular are spending millions on ads, door knocking and phone banking, trying to wake people up. Trump's campaign is functioning, I guess we can say, a little bit more lean. And there's a split on the right about the best way to turn out the vote.\n\nINSKEEP: Hasn't Trump himself illustrated that split?\n\nMONTANARO: He has. I mean, he's been a bit all over the place. He's muddied the waters on a lot of this. He made all these false claims after the 2020 election, which courts have proven he lost legitimately. He said falsely that mail-in voting, for example, is a Trojan horse for fraud. Back in February during a rally in Michigan, he encouraged his voters to vote early, but he said this about mail-in voting.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nDONALD TRUMP: Mail-in voting is totally corrupt. Get that through your head.\n\nMONTANARO: OK? But he's done a complete about-face in the past month. Here he was at the end of April in a video he posted to his social media platform.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nTRUMP: Absentee voting, early voting and Election Day voting are all good options. Republicans must make a plan. Register and vote.\n\nMONTANARO: All good options, he said. And that's a big change. There's a split, though, among activists as well. There's one group, Turning Point Action, which is vowing to spend tens of millions of dollars to do Republican turnout. But the group put out a video saying it wants to make Republicans day-of voters. That's exactly what veteran Republican strategists say you should not be trying to do. Strategists like Mike Duncan, for example, who's worked on various campaigns, including for Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell, he was pretty incensed about this idea. Here he is talking on the \"Ruthless\" podcast, which he co-hosts.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"RUTHLESS\")\n\nMICHAEL DUNCAN: Why cut off your nose to spite your face? It's like, the world exists as it is. And there's absentee by mail. There's early voting. And if we lose those, then we lose. We just lose.\n\nMONTANARO: I mean, trying to turn out everyone on Election Day is risky. That's especially true for Republicans because a big portion of Trump's base are white voters without college degrees, and they're among the least likely to vote.\n\nINSKEEP: Yeah. Domenico, I'm thinking about this early election calendar, the way that everything has been moved up, the way the election is effectively now. And that seems like a special challenge for President Biden's people because they're behind. They're behind by about a point in polling averages. Their assumption, what they express is that they're going to pull ahead once voters start to pay attention, once voters see what their choice is. The calendar means they're running out of time to get voters to pay attention.\n\nMONTANARO: Yeah, I think that's a big piece of it. It's a big piece of why they wanted this debate before the conventions, because there's still this sort of sense out there among a lot of Democratic voters and Republican voters, frankly, that maybe this isn't quite the field that you're seeing, maybe it isn't Biden versus Trump. Or they're hoping that it isn't either of these two men. The reality is it is. And I think that a lot of people just don't want to engage in the election because they feel like they wish they had a different choice. But the Biden campaign in particular feels like they need to get Trump's name, his voice out there and put - you know, show the contrast between the two men for this starkly different vision of the country.\n\nINSKEEP: NPR's Domenico Montanaro reporting on the moved-up election. Domenico, thanks so much.\n\nMONTANARO: You're welcome.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 NPR. All rights reserved.

        "text": "What is Project 2025 and what is Trump\u2019s involvement?\nHeavyweight conservatives joined together to create a roadmap for a potential second Trump presidency, and they are working to recruit and train the people who would work in an incoming conservative administration.\n\nProject 2025 details across more than 900 pages how Trump and his allies could dismantle and disrupt the US government. It suggests ridding the federal ranks of many appointed roles and stacking agencies instead with more political appointees aligned with and more beholden to Trump\u2019s policy prescriptions.\n\nLed by the rightwing Heritage Foundation, the project showcases a federal government that cracks down intensely on immigration, vanquishes LGBTQ+ and abortion rights, diminishes environmental protections, overhauls financial policy and takes aggressive action against China.\n\nOver the past few months, Trump has attempted to distance himself from the project after the Heritage president, Kevin Roberts, commented that the US was \u201cin the process of the second American Revolution, which will remain bloodless if the left allows it to be\u201d. But, as many in both parties have noted, Trump\u2019s policies align heavily with Project 2025, which includes a host of former Trump officials and allies as authors and promoters.\n\nHis attempts at disavowal also came as Democrats and the Biden campaign have brought more attention to Project 2025 and its aims as a way to inform voters of what could come with a second Trump term.\n\nKamala Harris, the vice-president and Democratic candidate for president, has cited Project 2025 in recent speeches and statements as evidence of why voters need to return a Democrat to the White House.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump wants to take our country backward,\u201d Harris said in a speech in Milwaukee on 23 July. \u201cHe and his extreme Project 2025 agenda will weaken the middle class. Like, we know we got to take this seriously. And can you believe they put that thing in writing? Read it. It\u2019s 900 pages.\u201d\n\nHarris brought up Project 2025 in her debate with Trump on 10 September, saying there was a \u201cdetailed and dangerous plan called Project 2025 that the former president intends on implementing if he were elected again\u201d.\n\nTrump retorted said he has \u201cnothing to do with Project 2025\u201d.\n\n\u201cI have not read it. I don\u2019t want to read it, purposely. I\u2019m not going to read it,\u201d he said, adding that the ideas in it, from his understanding, are \u201csome good, some bad\u201d.",

Republican presidential nominee was booed by Libertarians at Washington hotel on Saturday night . Trump\u2019s rocky ride underlined challenge to broaden his appeal both left and right on the political spectrum .",
        "text": "\u2018No wannabe dictators!\u2019: Donald Trump booed at Libertarian convention\nDonald Trump, the former US president, has suffered the rare humiliation of getting booed and heckled during a raucous speech to the Libertarian National Convention.\n\nTrump\u2019s rocky ride at a Washington hotel on Saturday night, including cries of \u201cBullshit!\u201d and \u201cFuck you!\u201d, underlined the challenge that the Republican presidential nominee faces to broaden his appeal both left and right on the political spectrum.\n\n\u201cThe fact is we should not be fighting each other,\u201d Trump pleaded. \u201cIf Joe Biden gets back in, there will be no more liberty for anyone in our country. Combine with us in a partnership \u2013 we\u2019re asking that of the libertarians. We must work together. Combine with us. You have to combine with us.\u201d\n\nThe appeal went down like a lead balloon as delegates booed, jeered and shouted insults. It was a stunning rebuke for a man who has become accustomed to cult-like rallies where his every word is cheered to the echo.\n\nThe Libertarian party, which prioritises small government and individual freedoms, typically gains 3% or less of the national vote but its members could yet prove crucial in swing states this November. Trump\u2019s clumsy attempt to court them resulted in him scolding them instead.\n\nTaking the stage, he was confronted by Libertarians, who have their own factional disputes, shouting insults and decrying him for running up huge federal deficits and enriching pharmaceutical companies with the coronavirus vaccine development. A smaller core of diehard Trump supporters clad in \u201cMake America great again\u201d hats and T-shirts chanted \u201cUSA! USA!\u201d. One person unfurled a Palestinian flag.\n\nView image in fullscreen A Libertarian party member shouts protests as Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump addresses the Libertarian National Convention in Washington. Photograph: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAmid this melee, Trump\u2019s appeal to Libertarians to vote for him or join his campaign were repeatedly rebuffed. Referring to the four criminal indictments against him, he joked: \u201cIf I wasn\u2019t a libertarian before, I sure as hell am a libertarian now.\u201d\n\nThe ex-president quoted an article written by political commentator Deroy Murdock arguing that Libertarians should vote for Trump. The crowd again erupted in boos and jeers.\n\nTrump retorted: \u201cOnly if you want to win. Only if you want to win. Maybe you don\u2019t want to win. Maybe you don\u2019t want to win. Only do that if you want to win. If you want to lose, don\u2019t do that. Keep getting your 3% every four years.\u201d\n\nTrump went on to argue that Libertarians should make him their presidential nominee or at least vote for him in the election. Again there were boos and wails of derision. He went on: \u201cThe Libertarians want to vote for me and most of them will because we have to get rid of the worst president in history and together we will.\u201d\n\nThe Republican promised that, if elected, he would put a Libertarian in his cabinet and others in senior posts. Again the crowd made clear its dissent. Ever the salesman, Trump prodded: \u201cPretty good. That\u2019s pretty big.\u201d But this time the old tricks did not work.\n\nAgain Trump chided them for getting 3% in past elections. Competing with chants, he said: \u201cNo, you want to make yourself winners, it\u2019s time to be winners. You have a lot of common sense.\u201d\n\nTrump pressed on with his speech, saying he\u2019d come \u201cto extend a hand of friendship\u201d in common opposition to Biden. That prompted a chant of \u201cWe want Trump!\u201d from supporters, but more cries of \u201cEnd the Fed!\u201d \u2013 a common refrain from Libertarians who oppose the Federal Reserve. One person who held up a sign reading \u201cNo wannabe dictators!\u201d was dragged away by security.\n\nThe ex-president claimed that much of his record was libertarian, citing examples such as tax cuts, slashing bureaucratic red tape, cancelling and defunding federal diversity, equity and inclusion programmes. He promised to appoint Libertarians to a taskforce to \u201crapidly review the cases of every political prisoner who has been unjustly persecuted\u201d by Joe Biden\u2019s administration.\n\nTrump said: \u201cAs everyone knows, it will be my great honour to pardon the peaceful January 6 protesters or, as I often call them, the hostages. They\u2019re hostages. There has never been a group of people treated so harshly or unfairly in our country\u2019s history. This abuse will be rectified and it will be rectified very quickly.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if you vote for me on day one I will commute the sentence of Ross Ulbricht.\u201d The room, where many had been waving \u201cFree Ross\u201d signs, erupted in roars and whistles of approval. Ulbricht was the founder of Silk Road, an online marketplace for the sale of heroin, cocaine, LSD and other illegal drugs, who in 2015 was sentenced to life in prison.\n\nWith that the tide had turned in Trump\u2019s favour and his gamble of addressing the convention was looking less disastrous than it first appeared. The crowd gradually became more muted and supportive.\n\nThe ex-president received further acclaim for pledging to sign an executive order banning federal agencies from censoring free speech, introduce record tax cuts, oppose the Green New Deal and drill for oil and gas, secure the future of crypto and bitcoin currencies and defend religious liberty and gun rights.\n\nStill, not everyone was won over. When Trump said, \u201cI want your support and again, you can either nominate us and put us in the position or give us your vote,\u201d a chorus of boos rose again.\n\nAfterwards one delegate, who gave his name only as Joe, said: \u201cHe\u2019s full of shit.\u201d\n\nGlen Lewis, chairman of the Libertarian Party of Mississippi, said: \u201cIt was a lot of politicking. He came here to tell us to pull our people\u2019s votes towards him using the fear of Joe Biden\u2019s presidency. But real men and women vote on integrity.\u201d\n\nLewis, 54, a military veteran who served in Afghanistan, added: \u201cI went into the group of Trump supporters who could not defend him printing money. They could not defend him giving immunity to the pharmaceutical companies. They could not defend him not stopping wars. I will benefit him with not starting any new ones, but he did not end the ones that were there.\u201d\n\nMichael Fitch, 35, who has been a member of the Libertarian Party since 2012, said he appreciated Trump\u2019s \u201cbravery\u201d in coming to the convention but has no intention of voting for him. \u201cA lot of people like Donald Trump because they think he\u2019s a conservative but he\u2019s not a conservative,\u201d he said. \u201cHe actually raised the deficit \u2013 he spent millions and millions of dollars.\n\n\u201cHe capitulated to the pharma regime. Obviously his base, the Maga revolution, is very anti-lockdown but Donald Trump was the one who did Operation Warp Speed. We can\u2019t let this guy off the hook: if we\u2019re gonna come after [Anthony] Fauci and Biden, Trump\u2019s on the same list. He\u2019s just as complicit as the rest of them. I don\u2019t think his base fully appreciates that and Donald Trump isn\u2019t going to be the one to tell them it.\u201d\n\nJoe Gravagna, 77, a retired computer security worker from Westfield, Indiana, said he voted the Libertarian candidate in 2020 but might consider Trump this time. \u201cI like his ideas on deregulation, de-weaponising the justice system and non-intervention. He\u2019s less of a hawk. I don\u2019t think he likes wars. Anybody worth their salt would not have left Afghanistan with $88bn worth of weapons left behind.\u201d\n\nAmong the committed Republicans in the room was Brandi Bohannon, 37, from Gulf Shores, Alabama. She said: \u201cHe\u2019s different. No wars. He doesn\u2019t get paid off by K Street. He\u2019s honest. He\u2019s feisty.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never had a border this open ever \u2013 what, 8m have crossed? These wars would have never happened under Trump. Russia would never have invaded Ukraine. Israel and Palestine wouldn\u2019t have gone to war. Serbia and Bosnia look like they\u2019re about to go after each other again. So scary times.\u201d\n\nLibertarians will pick their White House nominee during their convention, which wraps up on Sunday. Trump\u2019s appearance also gave him a chance to court voters who might otherwise support independent presidential candidate Robert Kennedy Jr, who gave his own Libertarian convention speech on Friday.",

In 2019, Nauseda beat Simonyte with 66 percent of the vote.\n\nAs president, Nauseda has a semi-executive role, which includes heading the armed forces, chairing the defence and national security policy body and representing the country at NATO and European Union summits.\n\nThe former senior economist with the Swedish banking group SEB, who is not affiliated with any party, won the first round of the election on May 12 with 44 percent of the votes, short of the 50 percent he needed for an outright victory.\n\nSimonyte was the only woman out of eight candidates in the first round and came second with 20 percent.\n\nBoth Nauseda and Simonyte support increasing defence spending to at least 3 percent of Lithuania\u2019s gross domestic product, from the 2.75 percent planned for this year, in the wake of Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion of Ukraine.\n\nLike other Baltic nations, Lithuania worries it could be Moscow\u2019s next target. Russia\u2019s President Vladimir Putin has said he has no intention of attacking any NATO countries.\n\nThe uneasy relationship between Nauseda and Simonyte has also caught the limelight in foreign policy debates, most notably on Lithuania\u2019s relations with China.\n\nBilateral ties turned tense in 2021, when Vilnius allowed Taiwan to open a de facto embassy under the island\u2019s name, a departure from the common diplomatic practice of using the name of the capital, Taipei, to avoid angering Beijing.\n\nChina, which considers self-ruled Taiwan a part of its territory, downgraded diplomatic relations with Vilnius and blocked its exports, leading some Lithuanian politicians to urge a restoration of relations for the sake of the economy.",

Trump made a central issue in the run-up to Election Day.\n\nMr. Trump portrayed himself as the \u201claw and order president\u201d standing up to lawlessness, slamming \u201cweak\u201d liberals and calling demonstrators \u201cdomestic terrorists.\u201d Joseph R. Biden Jr., who charted a centrist course on law enforcement as a senator, vice president and presidential candidate, vowed to address racial inequities in policing while standing behind the police as they battled the rising violence.\n\nFour years later, the nation\u2019s crime rates have shifted. The politics, however, have not budged.\n\nHomicide rates are tumbling from pandemic highs in most cities, funding for law enforcement is rising, and tensions between the police and communities of color, while still significant, are no longer at a boiling point. But property crime, carjackings and smash-and-grab burglaries are up, adding to a sense of lawlessness, amplified on social media and local online message boards.\n\nMr. Trump is re-upping his blunt, visceral appeal to voter anxieties. He declared recently that \u201ccrime is rampant and out of control like never before,\u201d promised to shoot shoplifters, embraced the \u201cback the blue\u201d slogan against liberal changes to police departments \u2014 and even falsely accused the F.B.I. of fabricating positive crime data to bolster Mr. Biden.",

        "text": "Libertarians nominate Chase Oliver for president, spurning both Trump and Kennedy\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Libertarian Party on Sunday nominated party activist Chase Oliver for president, rejecting former President Donald Trump and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. after they each spoke at the party\u2019s convention.\n\nThird parties have rarely been competitive in U.S. presidential elections and the Libertarian candidate four years ago won 1% of the vote. But the party\u2019s decision is getting more attention this year due to the rematch between Trump and Democratic President Joe Biden, which could hinge again on small vote margins in a handful of contested states.\n\n\u201cWe did it! I am officially the presidential nominee,\u201d Oliver posted Sunday on X, formerly Twitter. \u201cIt\u2019s time to unify and move forward for liberty.\u201d\n\nTrump appeared Saturday night in Washington at the convention to give a speech that was repeatedly booed by many in the room. It did not pay off with the endorsement he requested, though his Republican allies on Sunday praised him for choosing to go before an unfriendly crowd.\n\nKennedy got a friendlier reception when he spoke on Friday and attacked both Trump and Biden for how they addressed the COVID-19 pandemic. He had talked up his support for the Libertarians and an endorsement could have helped him expedite the process of gaining ballot access in all 50 states, perhaps the biggest hurdle he faces in qualifying for the first presidential debate in June hosted by CNN.\n\nLibertarians prioritize small government and individual freedoms, with a mix of policy positions that could be seen as liberal, conservative or neither.\n\nWhat to know about Trump\u2019s second term:\n\nStaffing the administration: Here are the people Trump has picked recess appointments Follow all of our coverage as Donald Trump assembles his second administration.\n\nOliver is an activist from Atlanta who previously ran for the U.S. Senate and U.S. House from Georgia. His campaign website calls for major cuts to the federal budget with an eye toward balancing the budget, the abolition of the death penalty, and the closure of all overseas military bases and ending of military support to Israel and Ukraine.",

And with a host of international criminal prosecutions facing him what's the incentive for him to step aside gracefully IF he loses the election?\n\nSCOTT DETROW, HOST:\n\nIn Venezuela, polls show that Nicolas Maduro could lose the July presidential election, which could bring an end to his authoritarian regime. But there's a catch. As John Otis reports, should Maduro leave office, he could face criminal prosecution.\n\nJOHN OTIS, BYLINE: It used to be that, in exchange for leaving power, dictators could go into exile and avoid facing justice for their crimes. That's no longer the case. Founded in 2002, the International Criminal Court, or ICC, can go after ousted leaders no matter where they hide. And that spells trouble for Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. The ICC is investigating his regime for torture, sexual violence and arbitrary detentions.\n\nGEOFF RAMSEY: In Venezuela, there's very real evidence that crimes against humanity have occurred. And under international law, there really can't be any kind of pardon.\n\nOTIS: That's Geoff Ramsey of the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington. He adds that Maduro's legal problems include U.S. indictments for drug trafficking. But while holding Maduro to account is essential, especially for his victims, it could actually get in the way of a democratic transition in Venezuela. Ramsey says that if Maduro thinks he'll lose the July 28 election, he could call it off or rig the results.\n\nRAMSEY: The reality is that Maduro is not going to give up power if he perceives that there's any real risk that he could end up in a jail cell in Miami.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nPRESIDENT NICOLAS MADURO: (Non-English language spoken).\n\nOTIS: During his 11 years in power, Maduro has led Venezuela into its worst economic crisis in history and has nearly snuffed out its democracy. This has prompted nearly 8 million Venezuelans to flee the country.\n\nJUAN GUAIDO: (Non-English language spoken).\n\nOTIS: That's Juan Guaido, who in 2019 was recognized by the U.S. as Venezuela's legitimate president. Speaking from exile in Miami, he says that clearing the path for Maduro's departure should be the No. 1 priority.\n\nGUAIDO: (Non-English language spoken).\n\nOTIS: Guaido claims that average Venezuelans would gladly pay to put Maduro on a plane to Cuba, as long as it's a one-way flight. Until recently, Maduro's grip on power seemed firm. But new polls show opposition candidate Edmundo Gonzalez with a real shot at winning the presidential election, and that has launched a debate over what should happen to Maduro.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nPRESIDENT GUSTAVO PETRO: (Non-English language spoken).\n\nOTIS: Last month, Gustavo Petro, the president of neighboring Colombia and a Maduro ally, weighed in.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nPETRO: (Non-English language spoken).\n\nOTIS: Petro suggested that the loser of Venezuela's election receive a broad range of political, judicial and security guarantees. Opposition figures in Venezuela say they'd be OK with that. In fact, Julio Borges, who led political talks with the regime in 2018, recalled offering Maduro much more if he went into exile.\n\nJULIO BORGES: Choose the country, choose the money, choose the family, choose your friends that you want to have with you. And he always said no.\n\nOTIS: Now escape for Maduro won't be so easy. In 2020, the U.S. put a $15 million bounty on his head for drug trafficking, and soon afterwards, the ICC launched its investigation. Yet, there may be some wiggle room. Four years ago, the U.S. dropped drug-trafficking charges against a former Mexican defense minister to foster better relations with Mexico. Likewise, the U.S. could bend a little with Maduro to promote a smooth transition of power.\n\nJOHN FEELEY: There are many, many little things you could do or signal or trade behind the scenes.\n\nOTIS: That's John Feeley, a former U.S. diplomat in Latin America.\n\nFEELEY: You can make it clear - yep, you're a narcotics trafficker; you ever set foot in the United States, we will arrest you. But you could also send emissaries to say these are several countries where you might live.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Independent, impartial, thorough investigation.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED INTERPRETER: (Non-English language spoken).\n\nOTIS: As for the International Criminal Court, its chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, held a mostly friendly visit with Maduro in Caracas last month. Indeed, Khan could drop his investigation if a new Venezuelan government launched its own inquiry into abuses by the Maduro regime. For his part, Maduro avoids discussing life after the presidency because that would be a sign of weakness, says Leopoldo Lopez. He's a Venezuelan politician who spent three years in Maduro's jails.\n\nLEOPOLDO LOPEZ: It's a very difficult conversation for the Maduro negotiators to engage because once they start talking about this, it's the beginning of a transition, and they know it.\n\nOTIS: However, one Maduro regime hard-liner, Diosdado Cabello, did tackle the subject on his TV program.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"CON EL MAZO DANDO\")\n\nDIOSDADO CABELLO: (Non-English language spoken).\n\nOTIS: Referring to the ruling Socialist Party, he declared, \"the only transition that's going to happen in Venezuela is the transition towards socialism.\" For NPR News, I'm John Otis.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 NPR.

Look at the actions of the campaigns since March 6, a day after Super Tuesday, the unofficial start to the general election this year:\n\nOverall, $72.1 million has been spent on ads (TV, radio, satellite and digital) in that time in the presidential election, according to an NPR analysis of data from AdImpact, which tracks ad spending.\n\nAlmost 70% of that has been spent in the seven key states, especially in Pennsylvania, where $21.2 million has been spent. That means that almost $3 out of every $10 spent is going to one state.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nClearly, the campaigns see the Keystone state as, well, a keystone to this election.\n\nDemocrats are outspending Republicans by more than double \u2014 $49.2 million to $22.1 million.\n\nTake a look at the spending state by state. In every state, President Biden and his allies are outspending former President Donald Trump and the groups boosting him. In some places, Trump hasn\u2019t been on the air at all.\n\nLoading...\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign is the biggest spender of the election so far at $34.2 million and counting. MAGA Inc., an outside group supporting Trump, is second, putting up almost $12 million. Trump\u2019s campaign has spent nearly zilch on ads, just $70,521, as of Friday afternoon.\n\nFour dollars out of every $5 MAGA Inc. has spent has gone to Pennsylvania. The other $1 is mostly going to Georgia, where it\u2019s spending $1.2 million. Trump and allies have not been on the air at all in four of the Lucky Seven: Arizona, North Carolina, Nevada or Wisconsin.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr., who is running as an independent and is getting double-digits in most national polls, has spent a little over $800,000 total on ads.\n\nLoading...\n\nThe most-run ad of the campaign so far is this pro-Biden one about protecting the Affordable Care Act. It\u2019s run 7,700 times in 17 days in all seven states.\n\nIt\u2019s quite the turn, considering that Obamacare was the reason for Democrats getting \u201cshellacked,\u201d as former President Barack Obama put it, in the 2010 midterm elections.\n\nBut that reflects the change in public opinion. Back in January 2014, the ACA\u2019s popularity hit its nadir \u2014 53% unfavorable; just 37% had a favorable opinion of it, according to KFF\u2019s tracking poll. But as of April, 62% have a favorable opinion of the law \u2014 the highest ever.\n\nTerminate | Biden-Harris 2024 YouTube\n\nMAGA\u2019s Inc.\u2019s most-run ad is focused on immigration, but it has started to run this one most in the past week, which is focused on the economy (and makes unfounded claims about Biden\u2019s mental faculties).\n\nOn the issues, abortion has by far been the focus of the most spending and total number of ads. Some $19 million has been spent on abortion messaging, with 50 different ads.\n\nNext on the list (some ads reference more than one of these) are:\n\n",

        "text": "Here\u2019s what every key witness said at Trump\u2019s hush money criminal trial\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 After 22 witnesses, including an adult film actor, tabloid publisher and White House insiders, testimony is over at Donald Trump\u2019s criminal trial in New York.\n\nProsecutors called 20 witnesses. The defense called just two. Trump decided not to testify on his own behalf.\n\nThe trial now shifts to closing arguments, scheduled for Tuesday.\n\nREAD MORE: What to watch for in Trump trial\u2019s closing arguments, from a law school professor\n\nAfter that, it will be up to 12 jurors to decide whether prosecutors have proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Trump falsified his company\u2019s business records as part of a broader effort to keep stories about marital infidelity from becoming public during his 2016 presidential campaign. He has pleaded not guilty and denies any wrongdoing.\n\nA conviction could come down to how the jurors interpret the testimony and which witnesses they find credible. The jury must be unanimous. The records involved include 11 checks sent to Trump\u2019s former lawyer, Michael Cohen, as well as invoices and company ledger entries related to those payments.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at key trial witnesses and what they had to say:\n\nStormy Daniels\n\nAs Trump sat feet away, the adult film actor, writer and director, gave a detailed and at times graphic account of a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump in Nevada in 2006. After they met at a celebrity golf tournament, she said, Trump invited her to dinner but then engaged her in conversation in his hotel room and startled her by stripping to his underwear while she was in the bathroom.\n\n\u201cI felt the room spin in slow motion. I felt the blood basically leave my hands and my feet,\u201d Daniels testified. \u201cI just thought, \u2018Oh, my God, what did I misread to get here?\u2019 Because the intention was pretty clear, somebody stripped down in their underwear and posing on the bed, like waiting for you.\u201d\n\nDaniels said Trump did not physically threaten her, but \u201cmy own insecurities in that moment kept me from saying no.\u201d Daniels said she kept in touch with Trump for about a year in hopes of appearing on his TV show \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d but it never happened.\n\nDaniels spoke about accepting $15,000 for a magazine interview in 2011. The story was not printed at the time but ended up on a gossip website without her consent. Her lawyer, in consultation with Cohen, complained and had the story taken down.\n\nIn 2016, Daniels authorized her manager to shop her story again but found little interest until the release of the infamous \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d recording of Trump boasting about grabbing women\u2019s genitals without their permission.\n\nDaniels told the jury she accepted $130,000 from Cohen in the final weeks of the election in exchange for a legal agreement to keep the claim to herself.\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyers grilled Daniels about her motivation, eliciting testimony that she hates the former Republican president. She pushed back on the defense\u2019s suggestion that her story was fabricated, saying if it was fiction, \u201cI would have written it to be a lot better.\u201d\n\nWATCH: Stormy Daniels clashes with Trump attorneys during 2nd day of testimony\n\nDaniels\u2019 testimony was among the most awaited in the trial. She had shared her story before, but this was the first time she testified about it in front of Trump. Trump\u2019s lawyers objected to much of Daniels\u2019 testimony and twice sought a mistrial, arguing that her feelings of a power imbalance with Trump and her blunt answers about the alleged sexual encounter should not have been put before the jury.\n\nDavid Pecker\n\nA longtime Trump friend, Pecker was the publisher of the National Enquirer and chief executive of its parent company, American Media Inc., during the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nPecker told the jury he agreed to be the \u201ceyes and ears\u201d of Trump\u2019s campaign, looking out for damaging stories so they could be suppressed. He said he agreed to the role \u2014 and to a plan to publish positive stories about Trump and negative stories about his opponents \u2014 at an August 2015 meeting with Trump and Cohen.\n\n\u201cIf there were any rumors in the marketplace about Mr. Trump or his family or any negative stories that were coming out or anything that I heard overall,\u201d Pecker said, \u201cI would call Michael Cohen directly.\u201d\n\nHe said he told the National Enquirer\u2019s editor at the time, Dylan Howard, \u201cthat we are going to try to help the campaign, and to do that, I want to keep this as quiet as possible.\u201d\n\nPecker testified that the company squashed one potential story by paying $30,000 to a Trump Tower doorman. It paid $150,000 to former Playboy model Karen McDougal, to keep her from going public with a claim that she had had a yearlong affair with Trump.\n\nREAD MORE: Ex-tabloid publisher testifies at hush money trial about scheme to shield Trump from damaging stories\n\nBut when Daniels came forward, Pecker said, he told Howard: \u201cI am not a bank, and we are not paying out any further disbursements or monies.\u201d\n\nInstead, he alerted Cohen that Daniels was shopping a story about Trump, and let the lawyer handle it. Trump denies having sex with either McDougal or Daniels.\n\nWhen The Wall Street Journal reported, just days before Election Day, that the Enquirer had paid McDougal, Pecker said Trump was upset, saying, \u201cHow could this happen? I thought you had this under control?\u201d\n\n\u201cOur call ended very abruptly,\u201d Pecker said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say goodbye, which was very unusual.\u201d\n\nKeith Davidson\n\nA lawyer known for representing people trying to sell celebrity sex tapes or other embarrassing information, Davidson negotiated the hush money deals for McDougal and Daniels. He gave jurors an inside look at the negotiations and helped corroborate Pecker\u2019s testimony.\n\nAt first, Davidson said, the National Enquirer was not interested in acquiring McDougal\u2019s story, saying she \u201clacked documentary evidence.\u201d But the tabloid eventually bought it at Pecker\u2019s behest. Davidson said he understood it would never be published because of \u201can unspoken understanding that there was an affiliation\u201d between Pecker and Trump and that the National Enquirer would not run the story \u201cbecause it would hurt Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nDavidson said he dealt directly with Cohen, never with Trump. While Cohen may not have explicitly stated he was working on Trump\u2019s behalf, Davidson said he felt the implication was clear.\n\nDavidson testified that about a month after Trump won the election, Cohen complained in a phone conversation that the president-elect hadn\u2019t yet paid him back for the $130,000 payment to Daniels.\n\nMichael Cohen\n\nCohen, a flawed but vital prosecution witness, testified about working with the National Enquirer to suppress negative stories about Trump. Cohen insisted he was working at Trump\u2019s direction when the lawyer helped orchestrate the payments to McDougal and Daniels.\n\nCohen testified that he kept the detail-oriented Trump updated on the payoffs.\n\nRegarding the decision to pay Daniels, Cohen said Trump felt it was best to buy her silence.\n\n\u201cHe stated to me that he had spoken to some friends, some individuals, very smart people, and that it\u2019s $130,000. You\u2019re like a billionaire. Just pay it. There is no reason to keep this thing out there. So do it,\u201d Cohen said.\n\n\u201cAnd he expressed to me: Just do it. Go meet up with Allen Weisselberg and figure this whole thing out,\u201d Cohen said, referring to the Trump Organization\u2019s chief financial officer at the time.\n\nTestifying over the course of four days, Cohen told the jury he sought Trump\u2019s approval for the Daniels payment because \u201ceverything required Mr. Trump\u2019s sign-off. On top of that, I wanted the money back.\u201d\n\nWhen it briefly looked like the deal with Daniels might fall apart, Cohen said Trump got \u201creally angry with me,\u201d saying, \u201cI thought you took care of this?\u201d\n\nCohen used money he borrowed money from a bank to make the $130,000 payment to Daniels. Trump later reimbursed him. How Trump\u2019s company recorded those reimbursements \u2014 paid out of a Trump trust and personal accounts \u2014 is the core of the prosecution\u2019s case. Cohen said he submitted monthly invoices for a year for legal work he never actually performed, pursuant to a purported retainer agreement that he said did not exist.\n\nCohen said he discussed the reimbursement plan with Trump at the White House in February 2017. He recalled that Trump asked him whether he needed money, then promised a check soon would cover the first two months of invoices, totaling $70,000.\n\nJurors also heard a secret recording Cohen made of a meeting he had with Trump in 2016 in which he briefed his boss about the plan to buy McDougal\u2019s story.\n\nWATCH: How Trump\u2019s legal team is trying to ruin Michael Cohen\u2019s credibility in hush money trial\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyers have fought to discredit Cohen, pressing him on his own criminal history, past lies and his recollection of key details. On cross-examination, Cohen admitted stealing tens of thousands of dollars from Trump\u2019s company by asking to be reimbursed for money he had not spent. Cohen acknowledged once telling a prosecutor he felt that Daniels and her lawyer were extorting Trump. Cohen also insisted he did not actually commit some crimes to which he pleaded guilty in 2018, including bank fraud and tax evasion. In that case, Cohen also pleaded guilty to lying to Congress and to campaign finance violations.\n\nCohen is the linchpin of the prosecution case, the only witness to testify that Trump had direct involvement in arranging his repayment. The verdict could hinge on whether jurors believe him.\n\nHope Hicks\n\nTrump\u2019s former campaign and White House communications director, Hicks testified about the frenetic days after the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d leak as she and Trump\u2019s political advisers tried to contain the fallout. Hicks said she was \u201cvery concerned\u201d about the impact of the tape and she subsequently asked Cohen to chase down a rumor about another potentially damaging recording, which turned out not to exist.\n\nWATCH: What Hope Hicks said on the stand in Trump\u2019s hush money trial\n\nHicks said that after The Wall Street Journal published its article detailing McDougal\u2019s hush money deal, Trump was concerned about how his wife, Melania, would take it.\n\n\u201cHe wanted me to make sure the newspapers weren\u2019t delivered to their residence that morning,\u201d Hicks said.\n\nWhen news of the Daniels payoff started to emerge in 2018, Cohen initially told reporters he made the payment with his own money and without Trump\u2019s knowledge. Hicks said Trump also told her \u201cthat Michael had paid this woman to protect him from a false allegation, and that Michael felt like it was his job to protect him, and that\u2019s what he was doing. And he did it out of the kindness of his own heart.\u201d\n\nShe said, however, that it was \u201cout of character\u201d for Cohen to take such an action on his own.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know Michael to be an especially charitable person or selfless person,\u201d Hicks said. \u201cHe\u2019s the kind of person who seeks credit.\u201d\n\nRobert Costello\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyers called Costello, an attorney and ex-federal prosecutor, as their primary witness in a terse defense case aimed at undermining Cohen\u2019s credibility.\n\nAfter the FBI raided Cohen\u2019s home and office in 2018, Costello offered to become his lawyer. He told the jury that during their first meeting, Cohen paced anxiously, saying his life, and his family\u2019s life, had been \u201cshattered.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe said: \u2018I really want you to explain to me what my options are. What\u2019s my escape route?\u2019\u201d Costello said.\n\nCostello said Cohen also insisted that he had made the Daniels deal on his own, that Trump \u201cknew nothing\u201d about it, and that Cohen had no incriminating information about Trump he could offer to federal prosecutors.\n\n\u201cI swear to God, Bob. I don\u2019t have anything on Donald Trump,\u201d Costello quoted Cohen as saying.\n\nProsecutors countered that Costello, who was close to Trump ally Rudy Giuliani, cozied up to Cohen to keep him loyal to Trump.\n\nIn one email, Costello told Cohen: \u201cSleep well tonight. you have friends in high places,\u201d and relayed that there were \u201csome very positive comments about you from the White House.\u201d\n\nCohen ultimately chose other lawyers.\n\nOther notable witnesses\n\nJeffrey McConney: The Trump Organization\u2019s former controller testified about working with Weisselberg to set up payments to Cohen, including reimbursement for the $130,000 payment to Daniels, a bonus and money for taxes.\n\nRhona Graff: Trump\u2019s former executive assistant testified about adding McDougal\u2019s and Daniels\u2019 contacts to Trump\u2019s contact list in the company\u2019s computer system, the latter listed simply as \u201cStormy.\u201d Graff also said she had a \u201cvague recollection\u201d of seeing Daniels once at Trump Tower.\n\nDeborah Tarasoff: The Trump Organization\u2019s accounts payable supervisor testified about processing the payments to Cohen, including receiving checks that Trump had signed at the White House. Under defense questioning, she acknowledged permission to cut Cohen\u2019s checks came not from Trump himself, but from Weisselberg and McConney.\n\nMadeleine Westerhout: Trump\u2019s White House secretary from 2017 to 2019 testified about Trump signing checks, saying he sometimes would sign without reviewing them.\n\nAssociated Press writers Eric Tucker, Alanna Durkin Richer and Colleen Long in Washington and Michelle L. Price, Jill Colvin, Philip Marcelo and Julie Walker contributed to this report.",

He has so far not named his running mate and there is widespread speculation about potential contenders with several names doing rounds.\n\nIn an interview with News 12 New York, Trump said there are \u201cso many\u201d potential candidates for his running mates. He then went on to name four candidates who he said were doing \u201cfantastic work\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn nearly all surveys so far, Trump has higher ratings than US President Joe Biden. In the latest survey by Emmerson College conducted earlier this month, he leads Biden by 5%.\n\nWho are Trump\u2019s favourite picks for Vice President?\n\nWhen asked to name top contenders for his running mate, Trump dropped four names.\n\nTrump named Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, Dr Ben Carson, Senator JD Vance from Ohio, and Representative Elise Stefanik from New York as his top picks.\n\nOf the four, Carson has been most closely associated with Trump as he was his Secretary of Housing and Urban Development in his first presidency.\n\nIn an interview with News 12 New York, Trump said he did not want to name top candidates as there were \u201cso many\u201d.\n\n\u201cWell, we have so many. I don\u2019t want to do that \u2014 but we have so many! You could take people like Ben Carson, you could take people like Marco Rubio and JD Vance. I mean there are so many! Elise Stefanik is doing a fantastic job. But I can go on for quite a long time. We have many people that will do a really fantastic job,\u201d said Trump.\n\nIs Nikki Haley going to be in Trump\u2019s cabinet?\n\nAfter a fierce contest for the Republican Party\u2019s nomination during which Nikki Haley denounced Trump repeatedly, there are signs that the two could be bridging their differences.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarlier this week, Haley endorsed Trump in the US presidential election. Three days later, Trump said he thinks \u201cshe will going to be in our team\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of the same ideas and same thoughts. I appreciate what she said. I know we had a nasty campaign, it was pretty nasty, but she is a very capable person and I am sure she is going to be on our team in some form,\u201d said Trump.\n\nHaley served as the US Ambassador to the United Nations (UN) during Trump\u2019s presidency (2016-18), but she resigned midway. Then, last year, she launched her presidential campaign that she ended earlier this year. Then, earlier this week, she endorsed Trump in what many people saw as a sign that she could be seeking a place in a second Trump presidency, perhaps even a running mate ticket.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCould there be a wild card entry?\n\nWhile Trump has dropped four names and there are speculations about Haley, there is another Republican leader who may have a wild card entry: Tom Cotton.\n\nCotton is a senator from Arkansas and is a US Army veteran.\n\nCotton has emerged as an unexpected \u201ctop candidate\u201d for Trump\u2019s running mate, according to The New York Times.\n\nTrump has privately said that he sees Cotton as a reliable and effective communicator, as per the newspaper.\n\nThe report further said that the emergence of Cotton as a top contender shows that Trump is \u201cheavily weighing experience and the ability to run a disciplined campaign over other factors\u201d.",

I am officially the presidential nominee,\u201d Oliver posted on X after his nomination was approved. \u201cIt\u2019s time to unify and move forward for liberty.\u201d\n\nThird parties have rarely been competitive in the US presidential election and the Libertarian candidate four years ago won 1 percent of the vote.\n\nBut the party\u2019s decision is getting more attention this year due to the rematch between Trump and Democratic President Joe Biden, which could hinge again on small vote margins in a handful of contested states.\n\nIn a speech on Sunday, Oliver, who is an antiwar activist, pledged to support a \u201cceasefire\u201d as well as the end of \u201cgenocide\u201d in Gaza.\n\nLeading up to his nomination, Oliver said he had received the highest amount of campaign donations among all the Libertarian candidates.\n\nOn Saturday night, Trump appeared in Washington at the Libertarian convention to give a speech that was repeatedly booed by many in the room. It did not pay off with the endorsement he requested, though his Republican allies praised him for choosing to go before an unfriendly crowd.\n\nTrump\u2019s appearance at the gathering, unusual for a Republican candidate, also signalled how seriously he and his campaign take the threat of third-party candidate Kennedy, who has long opposed vaccines and mandates.\n\nKennedy was quickly eliminated from the party\u2019s presidential nomination on Sunday. Still, he got a friendlier reception when he spoke on Friday and attacked both Trump and Biden for how they addressed the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nKennedy had talked up his support for the Libertarians and an endorsement could have helped him expedite the process of gaining ballot access in all 50 states, perhaps the biggest hurdle he faces in qualifying for the first presidential debate in June hosted by CNN.\n\nLibertarians prioritise small government and individual freedoms, with a mix of policy positions that could be seen as liberal, conservative or neither.\n\nOliver is an activist and openly gay politician from Atlanta who previously ran for the US Senate and US House from Georgia.\n\nDuring his Senate campaign in Georgia, he ended up gaining enough votes to deny the two highest vote-getters an outright majority of 50 percent plus one, thus forcing a run-off that was later won by a Democrat. This year, he could again act as a spoiler in the presidential race.\n\nOliver\u2019s campaign website calls for major cuts to the federal budget with an eye towards balancing it, the abolition of the death penalty, and the closure of all overseas military bases and ending of military support to Israel and Ukraine.\n\nHe also promised to appeal to the 41 million young Americans, adding that voters are \u201cfed up by the status quo and negativity\u201d in the Democratic and Republican parties.\n\nOliver will be joined on the ticket by vice presidential candidate Mike ter Maat, according to The Hill, a US news publication.",

        "text": "The main contenders to replace Raisi in Iran\u2019s snap presidential election\nWith a month to go before Iran\u2019s snap presidential election to replace ultraconservative Ebrahim Raisi following his death in a May 19 helicopter crash, a clearer picture is emerging of other conservatives who may become the only approved candidates in the race.\n\nThe Iranian government set the presidential election for June 28, with prospective candidates invited to register during a five-day period beginning Thursday. All candidates must be vetted by the Guardian Council, an unelected body stacked with loyalists of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\nIn reports published Sunday, Iranian state media said the council will announce the approved candidates about two weeks before the vote.\n\nRaisi was elected president in a 2021 vote marred by a record low turnout, with many Iranians disinterested after the Guardian Council barred his most prominent rivals from running. Some observers saw the election of Raisi, a protege of the 85-year-old Khamenei, as a sign of the supreme leader favoring Raisi to become his successor.\n\nOne possible candidate for next month\u2019s race for is acting President Mohammad Mokhber, who had been Raisi\u2019s first vice president and was next in line to assume the presidency upon the president\u2019s death, according to the terms of Iran\u2019s Islamist constitution.\n\nJason Brodsky, policy director for U.S. advocacy group United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI) and a longtime observer of Iranian politics, said he has seen mixed signals about whether Mokhber will register as a presidential candidate. He discussed other likely contenders in an interview for the Monday edition of VOA\u2019s \u201cFlashpoint Global Crises\u201d program.\n\nThis interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.\n\nVOA: What signals should we be looking for regarding whom Supreme Leader Khamenei wants to be the next president?\n\nJason Brodsky, UANI policy director: We have to look at which candidates the Guardian Council disqualifies. In this round of presidential elections, there are a few announced and potential candidates who are being spoken about in Iranian media. I'll list them briefly.\n\nOne is Saeed Jalili, a hard-line figure who was formerly the secretary of the Supreme National Security Council and currently is Khamenei\u2019s representative in the council. Jalili has been in favor of aggressive moves in advancing Iran's nuclear program [which Tehran says is peaceful and Western powers fear it is aimed at developing nuclear weapons]. He already has announced his presidential candidacy.\n\nAnother contender is Ali Larijani, who seems to have a personal desire to run, but is unsure of getting a green light for his candidacy from the ruling governmental system. That is because of his baggage from the 2021 presidential race, when he was disqualified in an embarrassing manner after having served as the speaker of Iran\u2019s parliament.\n\nLarijani is probably the most qualified potential presidential candidate on the field in terms of the number of positions he has had in the Islamic Republic's bureaucracy: culture minister, head of state broadcaster Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB), Supreme National Security Council secretary and speaker of parliament.\n\nAmong other figures seen as presidential contenders is Mehrdad Bazrpash, Iran\u2019s minister of roads and urban development. He is an alum of former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad\u2019s administration. Prior to that, Bazrpash was a member of a student Basij militia organization. He is part of this young generation of \u201chezbollahis\u201d [fervent supporters of the Islamic Republic] that Khamenei has been cultivating.\n\nParviz Fattah, another contender, is head of the state-owned enterprise Execution of Imam Khomeini's Order (EIKO). He also is a former official of Iran\u2019s top military force, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), and a former head of several state foundations and enterprises linked to the economy.\n\nFor example, Fattah led the Mostazafan Foundation charitable trust and the IRGC Cooperative Foundation. He is under multiple U.S. sanctions designations.\n\nVOA: What qualities or qualifications do you think Khamenei is looking for in his next president?\n\nBrodsky: I think Khamenei is laser focused on succession in the Islamic Republic. That is his largest priority. He wants to install someone in the presidency who is a trusted pair of hands during a sensitive moment in the Islamic Republic's history.\n\nLet's not forget that the next Iranian president will be in office for a full four-year term. So, Khamenei is making a long-term placement in this office, and he wants to make sure the presidential office is occupied by someone who will not cause problems for his priorities during a succession process.",

More than half of Americans say they are following news about the 2024 presidential election very or fairly closely . Many Americans are also experiencing fatigue over election coverage .

        "text": "More than half of Americans are following election news closely, and many are already worn out\nJournalists await the \u201cfirst-in-the-nation\u201d midnight vote for New Hampshire\u2019s 2024 primary at The Balsams Resort in Dixville Notch on Jan. 22, 2024. (Sebastien St-Jean/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nA majority of Americans say they are closely following news about the 2024 U.S. presidential election, a slightly higher share than in April 2020. At the same time, many people already say they are worn out by so much coverage of the campaign and candidates, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted this April.\n\nHow we did this To examine Americans\u2019 habits and attitudes toward political and election news and information, Pew Research Center surveyed 8,709 U.S. adults from April 8 to 14, 2024. Everyone who completed the survey is a member of the Center\u2019s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. This way nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The surveys are weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. Read more about the ATP\u2019s methodology. Here are the questions used for this analysis, along with responses, and its methodology. Pew Research Center is a subsidiary of The Pew Charitable Trusts, its primary funder. This is the latest analysis in Pew Research Center\u2019s ongoing investigation of the state of news, information and journalism in the digital age, a research program funded by The Pew Charitable Trusts, with generous support from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation.\n\nHow closely Americans follow election news\n\nMore than half of Americans (58%) say they are following news about candidates for the 2024 presidential election very or fairly closely. Another 28% say they aren\u2019t following it too closely, and 13% aren\u2019t following it closely at all.\n\nThe share of Americans who are closely following election news is slightly higher now than it was in April 2020 (52%). In October 2020, however, that share increased to 75%.\n\nThis year, Republicans and independents who lean toward the Republican Party are slightly more likely than Democrats and Democratic leaners to say they are closely following election news (64% vs. 58%).\n\nAs in past presidential elections, older adults are more likely than younger adults to say they are closely following news about the candidates. Roughly eight-in-ten U.S. adults ages 65 and older (82%) currently say this, compared with 68% of those ages 50 to 64, 48% of those ages 30 to 49, and only 34% of those ages 18 to 29.\n\nFatigue over election coverage\n\nAlthough many Americans are following news about the 2024 presidential candidates, they are also experiencing fatigue over election coverage. About six-in-ten U.S. adults (62%) already say they are worn out by so much coverage of the campaign and candidates, while 35% say they like seeing a lot of this coverage.\n\nThis is similar to the share of Americans who said they felt worn out at later points in the last two presidential election years. In June and July 2016, 59% of Americans said they felt worn out, and in October 2020, 61% felt this way.\n\nAmericans who are following election news closely are less likely than those who aren\u2019t to be worn out by election coverage. Four-in-ten Americans who say they follow news about candidates very closely say they are worn out by so much coverage, compared with 77% of those who say they don\u2019t follow it closely at all.\n\nRepublicans are slightly less likely than Democrats to say they are worn out by election coverage (58% vs. 66%). This gap is driven by conservative Republicans (55%), who are less likely than moderate or liberal Republicans (65%) to feel worn out.\n\nHow Americans come across election news\n\nAmericans are more likely to say they mostly get political news because they happen to come across it (57%) than because they are looking for it (42%).\n\nHowever, there are striking differences on this question by age. Just a quarter of Americans ages 18 to 29 say they mostly get political news because they are looking for it, compared with 60% of those 65 and older \u2013 a gap of 35 percentage points.\n\nThose who say they closely follow news about the 2024 presidential election are also far more likely to actively seek out political news. About six-in-ten U.S. adults who closely follow election news (58%) say they mostly get political news this way, compared with 18% of those who are not closely following election news.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats are equally likely to say they mostly get political news because they look for it (44% vs. 43%). However, independents who do not lean toward either party (21%) are about half as likely to say this.\n\nSources of election news\n\nWe also asked what type of sources Americans get most of their political and election news from. A majority of U.S. adults (62%) say they get most of this news from journalists and news organizations. (The question did not ask how people access that news, such as through TV, print, news websites or social media.)\n\nAround one-in-ten Americans (11%) say they get most political and election news from friends, family and neighbors. Smaller shares say they get most of this news from celebrities and social media personalities (4%), politicians and political parties (3%), and ordinary people they don\u2019t know (2%). An additional 17% say they don\u2019t get most of their political or election news from any of these sources.\n\nThere are a few differences in election news sources by Americans\u2019 age and political party:\n\nOlder Americans are far more likely than younger ones to say they get most political and election news from journalists and news organizations. Around three-quarters of Americans ages 65 and older (78%) say this, compared with 68% of those ages 50 to 64, 55% of those 30 to 49, and 45% of those 18 to 29.\n\nare far more likely than younger ones to say they get most political and election news from journalists and news organizations. Around three-quarters of Americans ages 65 and older (78%) say this, compared with 68% of those ages 50 to 64, 55% of those 30 to 49, and 45% of those 18 to 29. Adults under 30 are significantly more likely than those 65 and older to say they get most of this news from celebrities and social media personalities (10% vs. 1%). They are also more likely to get this news from friends, family and neighbors (18% vs. 6%).\n\nare significantly more likely than those 65 and older to say they get most of this news from celebrities and social media personalities (10% vs. 1%).

        "text": "The Politics of Health Care and the 2024 Election\nHealth \u201creform\u201d \u2013 a somewhat squishy term generally understood to mean proposals that significantly transform the financing, coverage, and delivery of health care \u2013 has a long history of playing a major role in elections.\n\nHarry Truman campaigned on universal health insurance in 1948, but his plan went nowhere in the face of opposition from the American Medical Association and other groups. While falling short of universal coverage, the creation of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965 under Lyndon Johnson dramatically reduced the number of uninsured people. President Johnson signed the Medicare and Medicaid legislation at the Truman Library in Missouri, with Truman himself looking on.\n\nLater, Bill Clinton campaigned on health reform in 1992, and proposed the sweeping Health Security Act in the first year of his presidency. That plan went down to defeat in Congress amidst opposition from nearly all segments of the health care industry, and the controversy over it has been cited by many as a factor in Democrats losing control of both the House and the Senate in the 1994 midterm elections.\n\nFor many years after the defeat of the Clinton health plan, Democrats were hesitant to push major health reforms. Then, in the 2008 campaign, Barack Obama campaigned once again on health reform, and proposed a plan that eventually became the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The ACA ultimately passed Congress in 2010 with only Democratic votes, after many twists and turns in the legislative process. The major provisions of the ACA were not slated to take effect until 2014, and opposition quickly galvanized against the requirement to have insurance or pay a tax penalty (the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d) and in response to criticism that the legislation contained so-called \u201cdeath panels\u201d (which it did not). Republicans took control of the House and gained a substantial number of seats in the Senate during the 2010 midterm elections, fueled partly by opposition to the ACA.\n\nThe ACA took full effect in 2014, with millions gaining coverage, but more people viewed the law unfavorably than favorably, and repeal became a rallying cry for Republicans in the 2016 campaign. Following the election of Donald Trump, there was a high profile effort to repeal the law, which was ultimately defeated following a public backlash. The ACA repeal debate was a good example of the trade-offs inherent in all health policies. Republicans sought to reduce federal spending and regulation, but the result would have been fewer people covered and weakened protections for people with pre-existing conditions. KFF polling showed that the ACA repeal effort led to increased public support for the law, which persists today.\n\nIn the 2020 campaign, health reform was a major issue in the Democratic primaries, with a number of prominent candidates supporting a Medicare for All plan. Joe Biden\u2019s platform was centered instead on building upon the ACA.",

        "text": "US political coalitions in the 2016, 2020 and 2024 president elections\nIn his 1796 farewell address, George Washington cautioned the citizens of the United States against forming political parties, which he claimed could undermine national unity, stoke division and even foment insurrections. Despite this advice, much of the country\u2019s history has been shaped by party rivalry, and in the modern era, the Democratic and Republican parties are considered the only viable electoral options at the national level.\n\nHowever, what each party stands for and which people it represents has changed drastically over time. Once a primarily Southern party that defended the interests of slaveholders, the Democratic Party shifted over the decades to a become a vehicle for labor and civil rights movements. The Republican Party, meanwhile, transformed from a modernizing abolitionist party to one favored by conservative and rural voters in the South. Today, the demographic coalitions that make up each party appear to be shifting yet again, with major implications for the country\u2019s future.\n\nPolitical coalitions in the 2016 presidential election\n\nWhile the Democratic Party was long seen as the party of labor unions and the working class, it began to lose blue-collar white voters in the 1990s following Ronald Reagan\u2019s presidency. Barack Obama successfully compensated for this loss in 2008 and 2012 by bringing together African Americans, Latinos and other racial and religious minorities, as well as progressives, women and younger voters.\n\nObama\u2019s campaign also saw college graduates, previously correlated with higher-income Republican voters, shift toward the Democratic Party in a trend that continues today.\n\nHillary Clinton sought to maintain this Obama coalition in her 2016 campaign against Donald Trump by embracing progressive policies and stressing racial and gender equality. But Obama\u2019s victory also relied on white working-class voters in northern states such as Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, to whom he appealed as an outsider candidate.\n\nTrump successfully peeled away large numbers of these voters with his promises of restoring American industry and rejecting mainstream Republican defenses of free trade. And despite what was often seen as racially divisive campaign rhetoric, Trump outperformed previous Republican candidates among nonwhite voters without college degrees.\n\nClinton picked up support among affluent and married voters in Republican-leaning suburbs, but many of these gains were concentrated in non-battleground states. At the same time, the former first lady could not match Obama in commanding the same high levels of turnout and enthusiasm among Black and young voters. And despite Clinton\u2019s emphasis on the historic nature of her candidacy, white women voters preferred Trump by a small margin. In the end, the Obama coalition proved to be unreliable without the Democratic Party\u2019s traditional blue-collar foundation.\n\nPolitical coalitions in the 2020 presidential election\n\nHaving unsuccessfully run for president since the 1980s, Joe Biden emerged as an unlikely front-runner in a crowded primary field.\n\nDespite being seen as a conservative choice, Biden quickly secured the support of more progressive candidates once he was nominated and adopted some of their positions in his platform. Biden\u2019s bipartisan record and blue-collar background appealed to older voters and suburban moderates, as well as independents and working-class voters. And harnessing Barack Obama\u2019s legacy as his former vice president allowed Biden to resurrect the Obama coalition in a way that Hillary Clinton could not.\n\nWhile Biden may not have been the first choice for many progressive, young and minority voters, the polarizing and controversial nature of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency and fear of his reelection was enough to secure their support.\n\nThe COVID-19 outbreak also proved to be a factor, with Biden a clear favorite among voters who considered the pandemic to be a major concern \u2014 especially in battleground states, where cases spiked before the election.\n\nBiden\u2019s appeal as a candidate managed to stem some of Trump\u2019s momentum among working-class white voters, where the Republican margin narrowed from 36% in 2016 to 32% in 2020.\n\nBut Trump improved his standing with several other voter demographics, some of them unexpected. The Republican candidate solidified his support among white evangelical voters, who were initially divided over his character and personal conduct before coalescing behind him in 2016.\n\nTrump\u2019s support among women also increased by about five percentage points, narrowing the gender gap.\n\nMost surprisingly, Trump made inroads with Latino voters in Southern states, despite his anti-immigration rhetoric. His appeal was particularly notable among Latino men, who preferred Biden by a significantly smaller margin than Latino women. The result was that despite his loss, Trump attracted a more diverse coalition than any Republican candidate in decades.\n\nPolitical coalitions in the 2024 presidential election\n\nThe 2024 presidential election will pit presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden\u2019s reelection campaign against presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, despite the legal challenges facing Trump\u2019s candidacy.\n\nBiden is expected to try to revive the coalition from his previous run in 2020, with messaging focused on reproductive rights, preventing Trump from returning to office and protecting American democracy from the threat of what he calls \"MAGA extremism.\u201d\n\nSuch appeals resonate strongest with college-educated voters, who have now emerged as the core constituency of the Democratic Party. In fact, education has now fully eclipsed income level as one of the strongest indicators of partisan affiliation.\n\nBut although college graduates now make up 41% of the electorate \u2014 far more than in previous decades \u2014 they are also overwhelmingly white.\n\nThe other large bloc that Democrats must rely on are nonwhite voters without college degrees \u2014 a group with markedly different economic interests and social views. It is among these voters that the Republicans stand to gain support by emphasizing cultural conservatism, anti-elitism and economic nationalism.\n\nOver the years, analysts have predicted that demographic trends toward a majority- nonwhite population would doom the Republican Party in the long term. However, the dynamics of the Trump coalition and the rise of Republican leaders like Nikki Haley and support for independent candidates suggest that the Democratic Party may no longer be able to take minority voters for granted.\n\nBoth parties will face unique challenges with key parts of their coalitions. The Biden administration\u2019s support of Israel in its war against Hamas in Gaza, which has killed more than 35,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health authorities, has alienated Arab and Muslim communities and younger Black and Hispanic voters.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump faces multiple criminal cases. And although he has dismissed the charges as partisan, many Republicans say they won\u2019t vote for him if he is convicted.",

We must work together. Combine with us. You have to combine with us.\u201d\n\nKennedy, the son of the former attorney general Robert F Kennedy and running as an independent after initially trying to win the Democratic nomination, earned a warmer reception after pledging to pardon Edward Snowden, the National Security Agency whistleblower now exiled in Russia, and drop espionage charges against Julian Assange.\n\nBut he was eliminated in the first round of Sunday\u2019s voting after winning just 19 votes, 2% of the total. Trump, who was not an official potential nominee, won six write-in votes.\n\nIn his acceptance speech, Oliver took aim at both candidates, as well as Biden.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Stakes \u2014 Presidential Transition Free newsletter We will guide you through the aftermath of the US election and the transition to a Trump presidency Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "text": "Biden celebrates son on Memorial Day as Trump lashes out at his \u2018human scum\u2019 enemies\nJoe Biden and Donald Trump marked the Memorial Day national holiday honoring America\u2019s war dead with jarringly divergent messages that promised to foretell the forthcoming US presidential election campaign as a contest of sharply contrasting characters.\n\nIn a ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, Biden paid tribute to the fallen as heroes who sacrificed themselves in the service of American democracy and ideals. Meanwhile, Trump, taking to his Truth Social site, took a very different tack \u2013 bestowing holiday wishes on those he branded \u201chuman scum\u201d and accused them of trying to destroy the country.\n\nBiden and Trump are neck and neck in national polling for the 2024 presidential election, with Trump often narrowly ahead. Trump is, however, polling more strongly in the key swing states that will decide the contest.\n\nThe targets of Trump\u2019s ire on Memorial Day included the judges who presided over his various trials and a writer who won more than $80m in damages after accusing him of rape.\n\nWhile his predecessor and 2024 opponent fulminated on social media, Biden \u2013 accompanied by Lloyd Austin, the US defense secretary, General CQ Brown, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, and Vice-President Kamala Harris \u2013 visited the the tomb of the unknown soldier at Arlington, final resting place for revered military heroes and US presidents.\n\nIdentifying his own family with the notion of national sacrifice, Biden highlighted his son Beau, attributing his death from brain cancer nine years ago this week to his exposure to burn pits while serving in the military in Iraq.\n\n\u201cThe hurt is still real, still raw,\u201d Biden said, after describing the \u201cblack hole\u201d that opens up for family members who hear the news of the death of a relative serving in wartime.\n\n\u201cI can still hear him saying, \u2018it\u2019s my duty dad, it\u2019s my duty. Duty \u2013 that was the code my son lived by \u2026 the creed the generation of service members have followed into battle on the grounds around us by fallen heroes.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s words seemed calculated to contrast with previous comments attributed to Trump about fallen members of the military, whom he is said to have derided as \u201closers\u201d and \u201csuckers\u201d for allowing themselves to be killed in battle.\n\nIf so, the glaring disparity was further emphasised by Trump\u2019s Memorial Day outburst, which reprised previous holiday volleys of abuse aimed at his enemies and opponents.\n\n\u201cHappy Memorial Day to All, including the Human Scum that is working so hard to destroy our Once Great Country, & to the Radical Left, Trump Hating Federal Judge in New York that presided over, get this, TWO separate trials, that awarded a woman, who I never met before (a quick handshake at a celebrity event, 25 years ago, doesn\u2019t count!), 91 MILLION DOLLARS for \u2018DEFAMATION,\u2019\u201d he wrote.\n\nThat comment was aimed at Lewis Kaplan, the judge in a civil trial brought by the writer E Jean Carroll, who alleged that Trump raped and then defamed her.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Stakes \u2014 Presidential Transition Free newsletter We will guide you through the aftermath of the US election and the transition to a Trump presidency Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "text": "The first Biden-Trump debate of 2024 features new fights between old rivals\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Four years ago, Joe Biden rehearsed for debates at a lectern in the basement of his Delaware home. Now, as president, he can pick a room at the White House, his retreat at Camp David, Maryland, or almost anywhere else in the country.\n\nBut as much as the atmospherics have changed around Biden \u2014 whether it's the room he's in, the ups and downs of the economy or the outbreak of wars in Eastern Europe and the Middle East \u2014 his preparations for rematch debates with former President Donald Trump promise to be remarkably consistent with his 2020 sessions.\n\nTrump is reluctant to practice for debates \u2014 much less engage in the full mock dry runs familiar to most presidential candidates \u2014 according to three people close to him.\n\n\"What's that?\" a Trump aide replied with dry humor when asked about Trump's plans to prepare.\n\nAnd yet on June 27 \u2014 the first time two men who have held the Oval Office meet in a televised presidential debate \u2014 they will have four years' worth of fresh material to battle over. Trump's primary message is that he is strong and Biden is weak. Biden's is that he cares about Americans while Trump cares only about himself.\n\nTrump advisers say he doesn't need formal rehearsals because he spends so much time interacting with voters and the media \u2014 at rallies like the one he held in the Bronx, New York, last week, at pop-ins at local eateries, in one-on-one interviews and in near-daily news conferences at the Manhattan courthouse where he's on trial.\n\nBiden's \"puppet-masters are in full panic trying to figure out how to prop up their feeble candidate,\" Trump spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. \"In contrast, President Trump is out delivering 90-minute speeches to tens of thousands of supporters and taking on tough interview after tough interview, talking about how we're going to bring back the great Trump economy and once again secure our borders.\"\n\nBoth candidates run the risk of making the debate about themselves \u2014 or even too much about their records \u2014 when persuadable voters will be listening to hear about their plans for the future. That's a particularly acute peril for Trump, who rarely passes up a chance to falsely assert that he won the last election.\n\n\"One of the issues here for him is how much is he talking about 2017 through 2020, his own record, how much is he talking about Joe Biden [and] how much is he talking in a forward-looking way about his own second term?\" said a person familiar with his past debate prep sessions. \"Time will tell if he is very forward-leaning. I would certainly recommend it.\"\n\nBiden advisers say his campaign will lay the groundwork for the first debate through paid ads, media coverage and grassroots communications designed to highlight Trump's appointment of Supreme Court justices who voted to overturn abortion protections, his embrace of election conspiracy theories and his efforts to overturn his 2020 defeat, as well as what they say is an economic agenda that would \"make his rich friends richer and jack up costs for the middle class.\"\n\n\"In the month leading up to that first debate, the Biden-Harris campaign will zero in on Trump\u2019s dangerous campaign promises and unhinged rhetoric,\" Biden campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon wrote in a memo last week. \"We will make sure that the voters who will decide this election are reminded of the chaos and harm Trump caused as president \u2014 and why they booted him out four years ago.\"\n\nComparing their presidencies is one lens through which they can be expected to filter battles over the economy, abortion rights, the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, the federal response to the Covid-19 pandemic and the future of American governance.\n\nThe White House and the Biden campaign have yet to finalize the roster of debate-prep participants. But Ron Klain, a former Biden White House chief of staff who keeps a file on every question asked at past presidential debates, will reprise a role he's played as a prep guru for several Democratic presidential candidates.\n\nA source close to Biden said the list of participants is likely to include White House aides Anita Dunn, Mike Donilon, Steve Ricchetti and Bruce Reed; O'Malley Dillon; and campaign co-chair Cedric Richmond. This source also mentioned author Jon Meacham and Michael Sheehan, who coaches Democratic candidates on oratory style, as possible prep helpers.\n\nIt is not yet clear whether Biden lawyer Bob Bauer, who played Trump in 2020 practice sessions, will do that again.\n\nKlain and Dunn both declined to comment for this article, citing their desire to keep the entire effort private.\n\n\"We're not going to discuss,\" Dunn said in a text message.\n\nTo the extent that Trump can be corralled into modified prep sessions, they are likely to be very informal discussions of issues and tactics.\n\n\"Conventional preparations are not something that he thinks he needs to do,\" said the person familiar with past debate sessions. \"Part of it is him wanting to save his best performance for the performance. Part of it is him thinking, 'I\u2019ve got this.'\"\n\nIn their first debate in 2020, Trump took criticism \u2014 even from some fellow Republicans \u2014 for repeatedly interrupting Biden and moderator Chris Wallace of Fox News. Biden laid something of a trap by interjecting in the opening minutes of the debate, which appeared to annoy Trump and goad him into becoming hyper-aggressive.\n\nWhen Biden pressed him to disown the Proud Boys, a white supremacist group, Trump told them to \"stand back and stand by\" in the stretch run to the election. He oddly accused Biden of wanting to get rid of cows.\n\nAt their second and final debate in Nashville, Tennessee, in October of that year, Trump's demeanor was more traditional, and the two men fought more over substance than style.\n\nTrump's inner circle still includes some of the people who helped focus him on the 2020 debates. For example, communications strategist Jason Miller is a senior adviser to his campaign, and Stephen Miller, a top policy adviser in Trump's White House, remains close to him. But two of Trump's three senior advisers, Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, weren't in top positions the last time around.\n\nGone from the debate-prep crowd are then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows; former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie; Bill Stepien, who was Trump's 2020 campaign manager; and Hope Hicks, a longtime Trump aide who isn't working on the campaign.\n\nIt's not clear how much debates affect the outcomes of presidential elections that involve billions of dollars in advertising by campaigns and their allies. But they are rare opportunities for voters to see the candidates side by side, countering each other's arguments on issues and character.\n\nTrump and Biden have agreed to face each other a second time, on Sept. 10, a schedule Biden proposed that leaves 2\u00bd months between meetings.",

        "text": "Libertarian Party nominates gay candidate for 2024 presidential election\nAfter a contentious seven rounds of voting on Sunday, the Libertarian Party nominated Chase Oliver, a gay sales account executive and former U.S. Senate candidate, to run in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nOliver will represent America\u2019s third largest political party, whose endorsement had been solicited by the leading Republican and Independent candidates, Donald Trump and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.\n\nLibertarian candidates typically earn about one percent of the national vote share during presidential elections, though Gary Johnson earned three percent in 2016, and Jo Jorgensen secured more votes than comprised the margin of victory in some 2020 battleground states.\n\nOliver\u2019s third-party candidacy for the U.S. Senate in Georgia in 2022 helped force a runoff election that was won by U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.).\n\nBoth Trump and Kennedy spoke at the Libertarian convention over the weekend, but they only earned a respective 0.65 percent and two percent of the votes from the party\u2019s 900 delegates. (Trump, a write-in candidate, would likely have been ineligible to receive the nomination since he is the presumptive GOP nominee.)\n\nTaking aim at Trump as well as the Democratic nominee, President Joe Biden, Oliver said during his acceptance speech, \u201cWe know that the lesser of two evils continues to give us more evil. But we\u2019re done with that, and so are the voters.\u201d",

Biden's ballot access had been uncertain in Ohio because of a conflict over the president's official party nomination and state election certification deadlines . The DNC's move to hold virtual nominations bypasses the ballot access concerns in the state . Biden has maintained that the president will \"be on the ballot after election after all 50 states\"",
        "text": "Ohio Senate passes GOP-led Biden ballot access bill without Democrats' support\nAs Ohio lawmakers convened on Tuesday for a special session to address President Joe Biden's ability to appear on their general election ballot in November, the Democratic National Committee said it would move to conduct virtual party proceedings to certify Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic Party nominees -- a move that works around Ohio's ballot certification deadline.\n\nOhio's Senate Republicans ultimately passed a bill that would both allow Biden to appear on their general election ballot in November, but also bar foreign contributions to ballot issue campaigns. The latter was a direct response to GOP objections to the \"Issue 1\" campaign last year that constitutionally protected abortion in the state. The move came without Democratic support, however, with members seemingly empowered to vote against the legislation following the DNC announcement.\n\n\"We don't need your fix. The DNC just released a statement several minutes ago that says we're going to hold a virtual vote of our delegates across the country and nominate President Biden to the ballot,\" State Sen. Bill DeMora said on Tuesday. \"We don't want a legislative fix that holds the voters and their rights to the whim of the majority.\"\n\nBiden's ballot access had been uncertain in Ohio because of a conflict over the president's official party nomination and state election certification deadlines. The DNC's move to hold virtual nominations bypasses the ballot access concerns in the state.\n\nOhio law mandates that political parties confirm their presidential candidates 90 days before the general election -- on Aug. 7. While Biden wouldn't have been the official nominee until the DNC convenes on Aug. 19, after the deadline -- however the virtual nomination helps ensure that Biden is nominated before the Aug. 7 deadline.\n\nThe legislation Ohio Senators passed Tuesday extended the deadline to 74 days, which is Aug. 23, following the DNC. The House still needs to take up the bill.\n\nPresident Joe Biden drinks coffee as he visits 1820 Candle Co. in East Palestine, Ohio, Feb. 16, 2024. Andrew Harnik/AP\n\nOhio's Republican Gov. Mike DeWine still urges a legislative remedy to the ballot access concerns.\n\n\"While I understand the Democratic National Committee has just today proposed a work-around to help get President Biden on the Ohio ballot, it is prudent legislation be passed to get this done. As I previously said, we do not want to leave something so basic as having the sitting President of the United States on the ballot to others when this can-and should-be done legislatively. It's the right thing to do,\" DeWine said in a statement.\n\n\"For these reasons, it is important that a bill or multiple bills that accomplish these common-sense measures come to my desk right away this week. It's the right thing to do,\" DeWine added.\n\nOhio Gov. Mike DeWine speaks, May 23, 2024 in Columbus, Ohio. Patrick Orsagos/AP\n\nThe Ohio Senate on Tuesday considered just one bill that combined both the ballot issue fix for Biden and also the banning of foreign contributions to issue campaigns. Democrats had objected to Ohio Republicans' efforts to vote push the two issues through during the special session, arguing that the GOP has made a legislative fix to address ballot certification -- a measure that has been granted to both parties in previous election cycles -- a political one.\n\n\"This special session and the combination of these two bills is a political trade made to try and extract some price to be paid for President Biden being on the ballot,\" said House Democratic Whip Dani Isaacsohn during a House Government Oversight Committee meeting on Tuesday morning.\n\nRepublicans have denied the assertion that they were being \"partisan\" in trying to combine the issues.\n\n\"Which side is really being partisan? Because if we all agree that foreign election interference and foreign contributions into our elections are a problem, then why would somebody vote no on this bill?\" said Republican Sen. Rob McColley.\n\nOhio is the only state where Biden would not qualify to be on the ballot this November. Alabama had also encountered conflicts between their ballot certification and Biden's official nomination, but their legislature unanimously passed a fix in May that was then signed by Gov. Kay Ivey, a Republican.\n\n\"The fact that we couldn't -- like Alabama and any other state that had to deal with the issue this time -- just pass a clean bill and put Biden on the ballot and deal with all the other issues ... separately. But to put them together has been the thing of heartburn for all of us,\" said Senate Minority Leader Nickie Antonio, a Democrat, Tuesday on the floor.\n\nThe special session to fix the issue legislatively was urged by DeWine last week.\n\nDeWine also endorsed the GOP-led initiative to bar foreign money from issue campaigns, however.\n\nThe Biden campaign has maintained that the president will \"be on the ballot in all 50 states.\"\n\n\"Election after election, states across the country have acted in line with the bipartisan consensus and taken the necessary steps to ensure the presidential nominees from both parties will be on the ballot. And this election is no different -- Alabama, with full Republican support, and Washington State are already taking action to ensure that voters can exercise their right to vote for the candidate of their choice in November,\" Charles Lutvak, a spokesman for the Biden campaign, said in a statement to ABC News.\n\nABC News' Mike Pappano contributed to this report.",

[+] Holbrook, Long Island, New York. (Photo by Andrew Lichtenstein/Corbis via Getty Images) Corbis via Getty Images\n\nKey Facts\n\nKennedy and his running mate Nicole Shanahan submitted 135,519 signatures, more than three times what is required, to New York election officials to be placed on the November presidential election ballot, his campaign said Tuesday. Kennedy has officially gained ballot access in seven states\u2014Utah, Michigan, California, Delaware, Oklahoma, Hawaii and Texas\u2014according to his campaign, which said it has collected enough signatures to be placed on the ballot in nine others\u2014New Hampshire, Nevada, North Carolina, Idaho, Nebraska, Iowa, Ohio, New Jersey and New York. Without the backing of an official political party, Kennedy is required to petition for ballot access in most states, though he\u2019s attempted a workaround in several states by soliciting nominations from lesser-known political parties, including the Natural Law Party of Michigan and the American Independent Party in California. While Kennedy hasn\u2019t gained ballot access in enough states to secure the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidential election, his presence on the ballot in just one of the six swing states (Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nevada, Arizona, Georgia and Wisconsin) that are expected to decide the 2024 election could be enough to sway the outcome as President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are consistently polling within single digits of each other. Kennedy\u2019s campaign has also filed lawsuits challenging ballot access rules in several states, including Utah and Maine, and his campaign has admittedly delayed filing petitions until the last minute to avoid challenges from the Democratic Party, his campaign spokesperson Stefanie Spear told the New York Times.\n\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We\u2019re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day\u2019s headlines.

Kennedy\u2019s place on the ballot is dependent on whether the Reform Party can regain its status as a minor political party with the Florida Division of Elections, however, the Florida Phoenix reported. State elections officials cancelled the party in August after it failed to comply with a 2022 audit, the outlet reported, and its application to be recognized again as a minor political party is under review, a Department of State spokesperson told the Phoenix.\n\nTangent\n\nThe DNC filed a complaint against Kennedy with the Federal Election Commission in February, alleging it illegally coordinated with the American Values 2024 PAC backing his candidacy to secure ballot access.\n\nKey Background\n\nKennedy initially launched his presidential bid as a Democrat, but later switched to run as an independent, allowing him to continue his bid if he lost the primary election to Biden. Polls are split on whether Kennedy, a scion of the country\u2019s most famous Democratic family but whose criticism of Covid-19 protocols appeal to Republicans, would draw more votes from Biden or Trump. Kennedy is currently polling at about 10% in the six battleground states in a six-way matchup that also includes independent candidate Cornel West, Libertarian candidate Lars Mapstead and Green Party candidate Jill Stein, along with former President Donald Trump and Biden, according to a recent New York Times/Siena/Philadelphia Inquirer poll.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nRFK Jr. Candidacy Hurts Trump More Than Biden, Poll Reports (Forbes)\n\nRFK Jr. Demands Biden Take \u2018No Spoiler Pledge\u2019 To Drop Out Of Race If Polls Show He Can\u2019t Beat Trump (Forbes)\n\nWhy RFK Jr. Could Hurt Biden More Than Trump\u2014As Democrats Launch Anti-Third Party Campaign (Forbes)",

        "text": "Optimal Cancer-Killing T Cells Discovered\nA team of cancer researchers, led by the University of Houston, has discovered a new subset of T cells that may improve the outcome for patients treated with T-cell therapies.\n\nT cell rendering courtesy GETTY Images\n\nT cell-based immunotherapy has tremendous value to fight, and often eliminate, cancer. The strategy activates a patient\u2019s immune system and engineers a patient\u2019s own T cells to recognize, attack and kill cancer cells. In this way, the body\u2019s own T cells become living drugs.\n\nWhile T-cell immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment, there is still much to learn. Unfortunately, not all patients respond to these therapies, so a better understanding of the properties of engineered T cells is necessary to improve clinical responses.\n\nOne such study, supported by a grant from the National Institutes of Health, is reported in Nature Cancer by the laboratory of Navin Varadarajan, M.D. Anderson Professor in the William A. Brookshire Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. The study uses the patented TIMING (Timelapse Imaging Microscopy in Nanowell Grids) approach which applies visual AI to evaluate cell behavior, movement and ability to kill.\n\nNavin Varadarajan, M.D. Anderson Professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering, leads the team that discovered new cancer-killing T cells.\n\n\u201cOur results showed that a subset of T cells, labeled as CD8-fit T cells, are capable of high motility and serial killing, found uniquely in patients with clinical response,\u201d reports first author and recent UH graduate Ali Rezvan in Nature Cancer. In addition to the UH team, collaborators include Sattva Neelapu and Harjeet Singh, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston; Mike Mattie, Kite Pharma; Nabil Ahmed, Texas Children\u2019s Hospital, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston; and Mohsen Fathi, CellChorus.\n\nTo discover the CD8-fit cells, the team used TIMING to track interactions between individual T cells and tumor cells across thousands of cells and integrated the results with single-cell RNA sequencing data.\n\n\u201cChimeric antigen receptors (CAR) T cells used for the treatment of B cell malignancies can identify T-cell subsets with superior clinical activity. Using infusion products of patients with large B cell lymphoma, we integrated functional profiling using TIMING with subcellular profiling and scRNA-seq to identify a signature of multifunctional CD8 T cells (CD8-fit),\u201d said Rezvan. \u201cWe profiled these cells using single-cell RNA sequencing to identify the CD8-fit molecular signature that could be used to predict durable patient outcomes to T-cell therapies and validated our findings with independent datasets.\u201d\n\nThe team also found that the CD8-fit signature is present in pre-manufactured T cells, longitudinally persists in patients post-infusion, and most importantly, is associated with long-term positive clinical responses. According to the researchers, it is likely that these T cells can drive clinical benefit in other tumors.\n\n\u201cThis work illustrates the excellence of graduate students Ali Rezvan and Melisa Montalvo; and post-doctoral researchers Melisa Martinez-Paniagua and Irfan Bandey among others,\u201d said Varadarajan.\n\nCellChorus, a spinoff from Varadarajan\u2019s Single Cell Lab at UH, is developing the AI-powered TIMING platform. The company recently announced a $2.5 million Small Business Innovation Research grant from the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences of the National Institutes of Health to advance TIMING for cell therapy applications.",

        "text": "Dems say they will get around Biden Ohio ballot issue by holding virtual roll call before deadline \u2022 Ohio Capital Journal\nThe Democratic Party is set to nominate President Joe Biden to be on Ohio\u2019s ballot after a month of controversy, their spokesperson said.\n\n\u201cThe Biden campaign is going to make an announcement today that they have a path to put Joe Biden on the ballot working through the Democrats and the Democratic National Committee to assure that Joe Biden is on the ballot,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Nickie Antonio said.\n\nDNC Chair Jaime Harrison said the party will use a virtual roll call, which would have to take place ahead of its Aug. 19 convention in Chicago and before Ohio\u2019s Aug. 7 deadline to certify the ballot. There is a precedent for this. A virtual roll call was held in 2020 because of the pandemic.\n\n\u201cJoe Biden will be on the ballot in Ohio and all 50 states, and Ohio Republicans agree,\u201d said Harrison, \u201cbut when the time has come for action, they have failed to act every time, so Democrats will land this plane on our own.\u201d\n\nThis comes as the lawmakers in Ohio entered their first day of a special session called by the governor to fix this problem.\n\nOhio requires parties to confirm their presidential candidates 90 days before the Nov. election, which would be Aug. 7. But Biden won\u2019t be the official nominee until the Democratic National Convention, which is on Aug. 19.\n\n\u201cWhile I understand the Democratic National Committee has just today proposed a work-around to help get President Biden on the Ohio ballot, it is prudent legislation be passed to get this done. As I previously said, we do not want to leave something so basic as having the sitting President of the United States on the ballot to others when this can\u2014and should\u2014be done legislatively. It\u2019s the right thing to do,\u201d Gov. Mike DeWine said in a statement.\n\nAntonio is grateful to the DNC, but is concerned about the second reason why DeWine called special session. The governor asked for the lawmakers to address the issue of foreign money in ballot campaigns \u2014 something that the Ohio Elections Commission reports is already illegal. However, there is no enforcement aspect, Senate President Matt Huffman (R-Lima) said.\n\nTuesday, the Senate passed H.B. 271 and the House introduced H.B. 2 \u2014 each meant to address the donations. For both of these options, Democrats say that the Republicans are just mad that they were outraised on the abortion rights amendment last year. That isn\u2019t entirely wrong.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a problem for a long time; It certainly went into overdrive on ballot issues last year. We mentioned in the 10s of millions of dollars that we\u2019re spending,\u201d Huffman said. \u201cYou can\u2019t say on one hand, \u2018Of course, I don\u2019t want foreign money affecting Ohio ballot issues\u2019, but \u2018I don\u2019t want to do anything about it right now.'\u201d\n\nBoth H.B. 271 and H.B. 2 would ban foreign contributions, but also gives more power to the attorney general\u2019s office to investigate alleged foreign contributions \u2014 including a possibility to fly internationally to question people, according to the Democrats.\n\n\u201cTo be clear what I oppose are components of the bill that have absolutely nothing to do with foreign money but are about giving more power for example to the attorney general to play favorites,\u201d House Minority Leader Allison Russo (D-Upper Arlington) said.\n\nH.B. 271 would also make it harder for groups to access the statewide ballot. It requires any group rallying for a cause to register as a PAC, meaning filing disclosures with the government and making it more difficult to collect signatures.\n\nLast week, the Ohio House said it didn\u2019t like these type of rules.\n\n\u201cWe have language that has input from campaign finance experts and important interested parties to deal with the issue. This is language that squarely and directly bans foreign influence in Ohio\u2019s issue campaigns, while not also inadvertently limiting the rights of citizens to have their voices heard,\u201d House Speaker Jason Stephens (R-Kitts Hill) said last week.\n\nDuring a gaggle with Stephens Tuesday, I asked him if he plans to stick by his statement of not limiting the will of the people, or if he would \u201ccompromise\u201d on that.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s always important that when you\u2019re looking at language \u2014 and this is why I think it\u2019s good to have these hearings, to understand so everybody can get a chance to read a piece of language that can be interpreted one way or the other,\u201d Stephens said, not answering the question.\n\nHe did say that this was now being evaluated from a legal standpoint \u2014 explaining the lawmakers need to figure out how to interpret the bills.\n\nThe Senate provision on PACs isn\u2019t in the bill \u2014 but Stephens seemed to suggest that he isn\u2019t ruling it out.\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019ll hear from different members all over the political spectrum, how they feel about changing the law for ballot access,\u201d Stephens said. \u201cI think there\u2019s some who think it\u2019s the right thing to do. There\u2019s others who think it\u2019s not the right thing to do. It\u2019s going to be interesting dynamic here in the house this week and we look forward to the discussion and the debate.\u201d\n\nFollowing this comment, and as his team was trying to get him out of the gaggle, I asked him if he thought it was the right thing to do. He did not answer me, so I asked again. He was then able to walk away from press.\n\nGovernor DeWine is asking for legislation from the lawmakers on his desk by the end of this week. Although Stephens acknowledged that it is holding up bills because they could limit the voter\u2019s voice, Huffman says the lack of movement is related to his relationship with the other party.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that we have a House, in my opinion, that has 67 Republicans, that in many ways is controlled by the Democratic Party,\u201d Huffman said. \u201cAnd as I\u2019ve said, when you have that situation \u2014 it\u2019s going to be very difficult to get decisions.\u201d\n\nThe relationship between Stephens and Huffman is contentious at best \u2014 as the pair are rivals and do not like each other. This Biden debacle has very clearly exacerbated the GOP infighting. Click here to learn more.\n\nThis is the second time that Huffman and his team have publicly called out Stephens for his relationship with Russo regarding the Biden ballot debacle.\n\n\u201cWe encourage the Speaker and Minority Leader to allow a vote,\u201d Senate GOP spokesperson John Fortney had said in a larger statement about the call of special session.\n\nFortney seemingly suggests that Russo is preventing Senate bills from hitting the floor \u2014 despite Stephens having a supermajority of Republicans. Stephens has been accused of being too close with the Democrats and allowing Russo to make decisions. The speaker has denied this, and so has Russo.\n\nHow did we get here?\n\nHere is a timeline.\n\nApril 5: LaRose\u2019s legal team emailed Statehouse Democratic leadership and Ohio Democratic Party Chairperson Liz Walters that there was \u201can apparent conflict\u201d between the nominating deadline and the DNC event, according to an email I obtained.\n\nApril 6-16: For the following weeks, lawmakers went back and forth on what to do.\n\nApril 17: Ultimately, Republicans agreed to actively help the Democrats by making sure Biden was on the ballot.\n\nMay 7: A House committee passed their bipartisan ballot fix proposal out of committee.\n\nThey completely stripped and amended Senate Bill 92 making it a clean bill. It changed the nomination deadline to 74 days, which is Aug. 23. This would likely be a permanent fix. It also allowed for less formal declarations of candidate nomination.\n\nThe main reason why lawmakers often choose to amend bills at the last minute is due to timing. By revising an already passed piece of legislation, one that typically is ready to be passed by the second chamber, the lawmakers fast-track the process of getting it to the governor.\n\n\u201cIt enables the notification to be a lot more flexible, whether it\u2019s email or whatever,\u201d Stephens said about his bill. \u201cThis gives the flexibility.\u201d\n\nThis doesn\u2019t just help the Democrats, Stephens added.\n\n\u201cJust four years ago, we had this issue,\u201d the speaker said. \u201cThe party in power in the White House usually goes last for the convention, so hopefully this will take care of that issue.\u201d\n\nRusso, who has a good relationship with Stephens, was pleased.\n\n\u201cI think everyone agreed this is good for democracy,\u201d Russo said. \u201cWe want people to have full access to the ballot, and that\u2019s good for both parties.\u201d\n\nMay 8: The Senate passed H.B. 114 out of the chamber. It changed the nominating deadline from Aug. 7 to Aug. 23 \u2014 but only for 2024, so it wasn\u2019t a permanent fix.\n\nThe lawmakers also added in S.B. 215, a campaign finance bill. In early March, Republican senators passed legislation meant to stop foreign donations to state and local ballot-issue campaigns. This could be by directly donating from outside the country or by donating to an entity, like a political action committee (PAC).\n\n\u201cMost Ohioans would agree that we shouldn\u2019t have foreign dollars affecting our ballot initiatives,\u201d Huffman said. \u201cForeign money needs to be out of these statewide elections.\u201d\n\nThis addition was unacceptable to the Democrats, Antonio said.\n\n\u201cThe language that has been embedded into 114 is yet another attempt to try to silence the voters of Ohio when they disagree with the supermajority of Republicans and go on their own to put together a ballot initiative,\u201d Antonio said.\n\nIt has provisions that could make it harder for grassroots movements to get on the ballot \u2014 even with U.S. dollars.\n\nIt would require all groups rallying for a cause that is receiving donations and spending money to register as a PAC. This means that groups would have to file disclosures with the government, and it could make it more difficult to collect signatures to get a proposal on a township ballot.\n\nThe bill also prohibits a lawful permanent U.S. resident, also known as a green card holder, from making contributions or expenditures regarding ballot issues or candidates.\n\nAll the Democrats voted no because of S.B. 215. Still, it passed 24-7.\n\n\u201cRepublicans in both the House and the Senate aren\u2019t going to vote for a standalone Biden bill,\u201d Senate President Matt Huffman (R-Lima) said, defending why he put the bills all together.\n\nAcross the Statehouse, the House \u201cinformally passed\u201d its version of the Biden fix, S.B. 92. This means it stays on the calendar but doesn\u2019t actually pass and isn\u2019t put up for a vote. It can be brought up for a vote at a later date.\n\nThe Senate sent over their bill to the House, who ignored it.\n\n\u201cWe had those conversations and ended up not doing it today,\u201d Stephens said about not concurring.\n\nMay 20: House lawmakers introduced H.B. 609. The bill prohibits the committee in charge of a statewide initiative or referendum petition from asking for or knowingly accepting money from a foreign entity or person. It also declares the bill as an emergency.\n\nThis bill has bipartisan support, as it doesn\u2019t have significant negative impacts on local community members, House Minority Whip Dani Isaacsohn (D-Cincinnati) said.\n\nMay 22: When the Senate saw that the House wasn\u2019t taking their bait with H.B. 114, they amended yet another bill to further their elimination of foreign contributions in state ballot campaigns.\n\nH.B. 305, when it comes to campaign finance, does relatively the same as S.B. 215 and H.B. 114.\n\nMay 23: DeWine staged a surprise evening press conference, calling for a special session.\n\n\u201cThis is an extraordinary situation when we have [a] ridiculous situation that we have not taken action to deal with a problem,\u201d DeWine said.\n\nSession will last from Tuesday through the special voting session on Thursday.\n\nSiding with the Senate, the governor urged the House to take up any of their three bills. However, his proclamation did state that legislators can also consider S.B. 92. He did not include H.B. 609, but the document states that lawmakers can review \u201cother similar legislation effectuating this purpose.\u201d\n\nThe House leaders \u2014 both Democrats like Isaacsohn and Republicans like Stephens \u2014 continue to say that it isn\u2019t the foreign interference ban that they are rejecting; it is the new restrictions to access to the ballot for citizens.\n\nStephens says he is willing to compromise \u2014 by making sure that a bill doesn\u2019t \u201climit the rights of citizens to have their voices heard.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor weeks, we have been pushing to find a legislative solution to having President Biden on the ballot. Ultimately, the will to do so wasn\u2019t there in the Republican caucus. Everyone agrees that we need to ban foreign political contributions from ballot issue campaigns in Ohio, and we have been driving towards a solution. We have language that has input from campaign finance experts and important interested parties to deal with the issue.

        "text": "Voter outreach groups targeted by new laws in several GOP-led states are struggling to do their work\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 During the presidential election four years ago, the Equal Ground Education Fund hired over 100 people to go door-to-door and attend festivals, college homecomings and other events to help register voters across Florida. Their efforts for this year\u2019s elections look much different.\n\nA state law passed last year forced them to stop in-person voter registration, cut staff and led to a significant drop in funding. Organizers aren\u2019t sure how robust their operations will be in the fall.\n\nGenesis Robinson, the group\u2019s interim executive director, said the law has had a \u201ctremendous impact\u201d on its ability to host events and get into communities to engage directly with potential voters.\n\n\u201cPrior to all of these changes, we were able to operate in a space where we were taking action and prepare our communities and make sure they were registered to vote \u2014 and help if they weren\u2019t,\u201d he said.\n\nAP AUDIO: Voter outreach groups targeted by new laws in several GOP-led states are struggling to do their work New state laws are making it harder for third party groups to register voters. AP correspondent Jennifer King reports.\n\nFlorida is one of several states, including Kansas, Missouri and Texas, where Republicans have enacted voting restrictions since 2021 that created or enhanced criminal penalties and fines for those who assist voters. The laws have forced some voter outreach groups to cease operations, while others have greatly altered or reduced their activities.\n\nThe Florida law, signed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis last May, imposed a $50,000 fine on third-party voter registration organizations if the staff or volunteers who handle or collect the forms have been convicted of a felony or are not U.S. citizens. It also raised the fines the groups could face, from $1,000 to $250,000, and reduced the amount of time they are able to return registration applications from 14 days to 10 days.\n\nWhat to know about Trump\u2019s second term:\n\nStaffing the administration: Here are the people Trump has picked recess appointments Follow all of our coverage as Donald Trump assembles his second administration.\n\nA federal judge blocked portions of the law earlier this month, including the one targeting felons and those who are not citizens. Even so, the law had a direct effect on the operations of Equal Ground and other voter advocacy organizations in the state before the ruling.\n\nThe League of Women Voters in Florida, one of the plaintiffs, shifted away from in-person voter registration to digital outreach. Cecile Scoon, the league\u2019s co-president, said the law stripped the personal connection between its workers and communities. Digital tools aren\u2019t easy to use when registering voters and can be expensive, she said.\n\nThese organizations are needed because local election officials don\u2019t always provide adequate support and information, said Derby Johnson, a voter in Ormond Beach who attended a recent community event in Daytona Beach organized by Equal Ground. He said it appeared the Florida Legislature was just trying to make it harder for certain communities to register and cast ballots.\n\nDerby Johnson, of Ormond Beach, Fla., asks a question of panelists during the Voters Education 2024 Community Forum, addressing the Florida Legislature\u2019s voter suppression tactics, Thursday, May 16, 2024, in Daytona Beach, Fla.

Among the provisions drawing concern was one that increased criminal penalties for anyone who receives compensation for assisting a voter, which especially affected the ability to recruit high school and college students for voter registration drives.\n\n\u201cThe law contributed to this culture of fear in our elections and being a person who registers voters,\u201d said Stephanie Gomez, the group\u2019s political director.\n\nRepublicans in Kansas overrode a veto by Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly to pass a bill that made it a felony if anyone registering voters impersonated or was assumed to impersonate an election official.\n\nThat forced Loud Light Kansas, a voter outreach group that focuses on minority communities, to stop its registration efforts. Would-be voters typically perceived their staff and volunteers as election workers even when told otherwise, said Anita Alexander, the organization\u2019s vice president.\n\nVoting rights activists Chloe Chaffin, left, and Anita Alexander talk about the work of their Kansas group, Loud Light, at Washburn University, Friday, May 18, 2024, in Topeka, Kan.

The Democratic governor said there has been no evidence in the state of widespread voter fraud or instances of individuals impersonating election officials.\n\nIn Missouri, the state chapter of the League of Women Voters and the Missouri State Conference of the NAACP sued after the state enacted wide-ranging election legislation in 2022.\n\nAmong other things, the new law bans compensation for those who register voters and requires that anyone who helps more than 10 people register must also register with the secretary of state\u2019s office and be a voter themselves. Violators can face criminal penalties.\n\nGenesis Robinson, left, interim executive director of Equal Ground Education Fund and Action Fund, speaks to attendees during the Voters Education 2024 Community Forum, addressing the Florida Legislature\u2019s voter suppression tactics, Thursday, May 16, 2024, in Daytona Beach, Fla.

So, there\u2019s a lot of trepidation, especially in groups that are targeting low-income or communities of color,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you just want to volunteer for one hour on a Saturday morning to help out on your college campus or on an Earth Day or anything, you have to go through this whole process.\u201d\n\nThe Missouri law is on hold while the legal challenge plays out, with a trial set for August.\n\nVoting rights experts expect to see continued attempts to restrict voting and the activities of voter outreach groups in Republican-controlled states, said Megan Bellamy, vice president of law and policy at the Voting Rights Lab.\n\n\u201cThe effort to target third-party voter registration groups is just, unfortunately, one of many policy areas that state legislatures are moving to address,\u201d she said.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press receives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

Also known as the \u201cClearies,\u201d the awards program celebrates the hard work of election offices across the country for programs that took place in 2023. Winning jurisdictions range from counties with 25,000 registered voters to states with over 7 million.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of a busy election year, but 2023 was an opportunity for election officials to implement new programs and test their effectiveness before the increased turnout of the presidential election.

Find the latest updates here.\n\nAs a jury deliberates on former President Donald Trump\u2019s criminal hush money charges in New York, 2 in 3 registered U.S. voters say a guilty verdict would have no effect on whom they plan to vote for in the presidential election, according to a PBS NewsHour/NPR/Marist poll.\n\nOverall, 67 percent of voters said a conviction would make no difference for them in November, including 74 percent of independents. That\u2019s a significantly higher number than the percentage of either Republicans or Democrats who said it wouldn\u2019t change their vote.\n\nIn fact, 25 percent of Republicans said they would be even more likely to vote for Trump if he were found guilty by a jury, while 27 percent of Democrats said they would be less likely to vote for him \u2013 a split that underscores hardened partisan perspectives on candidate Trump.\n\nTo Democratic strategist Simon Rosenberg, if Trump \u201cends up getting found guilty, I think it makes it much less likely for him to win. But [Democrats] don\u2019t need it in order to win.\u201d\n\nRepublican strategist Douglas Heye said he thought a guilty verdict would \u201cgive a subset of voters something to think about, but not a ton of voters.\u201d\n\nNarrow slivers of Republicans \u2013 10 percent \u2013 and independent voters \u2013 11 percent \u2013 said they would be less likely to vote for Trump if he is found guilty.\n\nThe latest poll also asked voters whether Trump being acquitted would affect their vote preference. A large majority \u2013 76 percent \u2013 seemed to see a not-guilty verdict as keeping the status quo, saying that outcome would make no difference to them on Election Day.\n\nBecause the Manhattan court proceedings are not televised, Trump\u2019s trial has gone largely unnoticed by many Americans, said Heye, who noted he has traveled extensively around the country in recent weeks.\n\n\u201cNo one is talking about the trial except people in Washington, D.C. and New York City,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised anymore.\u201d\n\nSurvey data supports that claim. Last month, 55 percent of Americans said they were paying little to no attention to Trump\u2019s hush money trial, according to a May 1 PBS NewsHour/NPR/Marist poll.\n\nThe lack of public interest in Trump\u2019s latest trial is indisputable, Rosenberg said, adding that it highlights how disengaged people remain at this point in the election cycle. \u201cPeople don\u2019t know the economy is growing, not shrinking. Why do we think they\u2019re going to know about Trump\u2019s trials?\u201d\n\nBut that is likely to change as Election Day looms closer, he said.\n\n\u201cAs the American people check in and go through the process of going from being disinterested to becoming a voter, the information they gain is far more likely to benefit [Democrats] than Republicans,\u201d Rosenberg said.\n\nBiden vs. Trump (and the 3rd party factor)\n\nIf the election were held today, 50 percent of national registered voters said they would vote for President Joe Biden, according to this latest poll. Meanwhile, 48 percent said they would vote to reelect former president Donald Trump.\n\nThis head-to-head has remained essentially unchanged for the last two months, and is in line with what many national polls have shown \u2013 \u201ca close, competitive election,\u201d Rosenberg said.\n\nTo Heye, it\u2019s significant that despite Trump being embroiled in scandal for years, the public\u2019s overall enthusiasm for the former president is statistically tied with that for Biden \u2013 a reminder, he said, that both candidates are deeply unpopular. In this latest poll, Biden\u2019s approval rating remains at 41 percent among Americans overall, while his disapproval rating is stuck at 54 percent.\n\n\u201cThat ought to send an alarm bell to Democrats more than Republicans,\u201d Heye said.\n\n\u201cI think the notion that Trump has a lead is not consistent with the data in front of us,\u201d Rosenberg said. A headline-grabbing New York Times/Siena poll in mid-May found Trump had an advantage in a handful of battleground states, such as Arizona and Michigan. More recently, Trump received support from former Republican rival Nikki Haley, who has continued to sap primary votes from the presumptive nominee despite leaving the race in March. Haley\u2019s supporters are seen as a key group to win over, and the Biden campaign has been trying.\n\nSix months ahead of the 2024 presidential election, voters still have a lot of time to decide who should lead the country. About one in four Americans said in this poll that they were not following this election closely, if at all. Rosenberg, who also called the current race a \u201ctrue toss-up right now,\u201d said that once voters begin to examine the records of both presumptive nominees, they will see that Biden \u201chas been a good president\u201d and that \u201cthe country is better off.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, he predicted, voters will find Trump\u2019s \u201cperformance on the stump is far more erratic and disturbing\u201d than in 2016 or 2020, and that \u201chis agenda is far more extreme and dangerous.\u201d\n\nWhen voters were asked to choose from a wider field of candidates, this poll found Trump had a small advantage: 44 percent of voters said they would vote for Trump, 40 percent said they would vote for Biden and 8 percent would vote for independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Kennedy \u2013 who, in the days since this latest poll was conducted, was rejected by Libertarians for their party nomination and also said he opposed the removal of Confederate monuments \u2013 received support from 17 percent of independent voters.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a strong candidate, and he\u2019s not going to be a major public presence in the election,\u201d Rosenberg said, adding that beyond his famous last name, the candidate and his agenda do not appeal to most Democrats. However, \u201cfringe candidates can impact the election,\u201d he said.\n\nEight in 10 national registered voters said they will be \u201cdefinitely voting\u201d in November, though that enthusiasm was less likely among younger voters. Sixty-nine percent of Gen Z and millennials said they will vote without fail, compared to 93 percent of the Silent Generation. In this poll, those younger voters (who seemed in this poll less sure as a generation that they would vote compared to others) favored Biden to Trump in a head-to-head match (52 percent to 46 percent), while the oldest voters preferred Trump to Biden (53 percent to 47 percent).\n\nA growing share of national registered voters say they know who they will vote for in the 2024 presidential election and nothing will change their minds. In this latest poll, 66 percent of national registered voters say they already know which candidate has their vote, up 6 percentage points since April. In another show of the youth enthusiasm gap, Gen Z and millennial registered voters were the most likely to be still weighing their options.\n\nPublic attitudes about the war in Gaza\n\nThe percentage of Americans who think the U.S. provides too much military aid to Israel (35 percent) has risen 4 percentage points since November, according to this latest poll, which was conducted days before a deadly Israeli strike on a civilian camp in the Gazan city of Rafah.\n\nAt the same time, a growing number of Americans feel the U.S. is being overly generous to Palestinians. Twenty-nine percent think the country is doing too much to provide humanitarian aid to Palestinians, up from 22 percent last November. Meanwhile, the percentage who feel the U.S. should do more on humanitarian aid is shrinking, dropping from 40 percent to 29 percent in the last six months.\n\nAnd yet, overall, more than a third of Americans (36 percent) said the U.S. is offering the right amount of humanitarian relief, according to this latest poll.\n\nWhen given a range of options about what the U.S. role should be in the war, roughly half of Americans (48 percent) said the U.S. should support Israel\u2019s right to defend itself against Hamas while also using its influence to encourage Israel to protect Palestinian civilians. To Mary McCord, a former Justice Department acting assistant attorney general for national security, the data suggests there may be more consensus around U.S. policy on the current Israel-Gaza war than some might think.\n\n\u201cPolarization is driven at the margins by people who are more vocal and whose positions get more publicity,\u201d said McCord, a professor of law at Georgetown University. \u201cThey drive the extremes. That creates an impression that\u2019s absorbed by the population that we\u2019re farther apart than the bulk of the population is.\u201d\n\nThough polls are always a snapshot in time \u2013 a survey taken this week, for instance, in the aftermath of the widely condemned Rafah blast, could have shown different results \u2013 the percentage of Americans who say they support Israel defending itself far outflanks the 25 percent of Americans who say the U.S. should withdraw all support for Israel until a cease-fire is secured in Gaza (something 38 percent of Gen Z and millennials supported). It is also substantially more than 23 percent of Americans who say the U.S. should fully support Israel\u2019s military actions against Hamas (an idea supported by 32 percent of the Silent Generation).\n\nThe PBS NewsHour, NPR and Marist Poll conducted a survey on May 21 through May 23 that polled 1,261 U.S. adults with a margin of error of 3.4 percentage points, 1,122 registered voters with a margin of error of 3.7 percentage points and 907 registered voters who definitely plan to vote in November\u2019s general election with a margin of error of 4.1 percentage points.",

        "text": "How Trump's Hush Money Trial Verdict Could Affect 2024 US Presidential Election\nJurors hearing the first-ever criminal trial of a former U.S. president began their deliberations on Wednesday in Donald Trump's hush money case, weighing a verdict with potentially big implications for the 2024 White House race.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up a payment that bought the silence of porn star Stormy Daniels shortly before the 2016 election. Daniels had threatened to go public with her account of an alleged 2006 sexual encounter with Trump, a liaison he denies.\n\nThe New York case is widely seen as the least consequential of the four criminal prosecutions Trump faces. But it has meant the Republican presidential candidate spent more time in court than campaigning in recent weeks, and brought outsized attention to the only case likely to go to trial before his Nov. 5 election face-off with Democratic President Joe Biden.\n\nHere is how three potential outcomes from the jury room -- a guilty verdict, an acquittal or a hung jury -- could affect the presidential campaign.\n\nGuilty\n\nOpinion polls show a guilty verdict could pose significant political danger for Trump in an election that will potentially be decided by just tens of thousands of votes in a handful of battleground states.\n\nOne in four Republicans said they would not vote for Trump if he is found guilty in a criminal trial, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll of registered voters in April. In the same survey, 60% of independents said they would not vote for Trump if he is convicted of a crime.\n\nRepublican and Democratic consultants have mixed views about the impact of a guilty verdict.\n\nWhit Ayres, a Republican pollster, doubts that as many as a fourth of Republicans would actually shun Trump if he's convicted. But Ayres said even if just a small number of more moderate Republicans and independents are turned off by a guilty verdict, it could help Biden in a close election.\n\nHowever, Ayres said the nature of the New York case, which was brought by a Democratic prosecutor and relies on untested legal strategies, will help Trump and fellow Republicans frame a guilty verdict as a political hit job.\n\n\"If I were trying to design a court case that would be easy for Republicans to dismiss as a partisan witch hunt, I would design exactly the case that's being brought in New York,\" Ayres said.\n\nRepublican consultant Tricia McLaughlin, who worked on former Trump primary challenger Vivek Ramaswamy's campaign, said she thought a guilty verdict would have a psychological impact on Trump because he hates losing. It would also divert more financial resources to legal bills because he would be almost certain to appeal a guilty verdict, she added.\n\nBill Galston, an analyst and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington, said he didn't expect a guilty verdict would have a significant impact on the presidential race.\n\n\"In the end, this amounts to lying about sex. I think the view probably of the majority of Americans is that everybody lies about sex,\" said Galston, who has worked on Democratic presidential campaigns.\n\nHe also served in the administration of President Bill Clinton, whose 1990s tenure in the White House was marked by sex scandals.\n\nNot Guilty\n\nConsultants from across the political spectrum agree on one thing: An acquittal would be a huge victory for Trump, especially because he has claimed the trial is a sham political persecution aimed at derailing his presidential bid.\n\nOn the campaign trail, the candidate could use a not-guilty verdict in New York to claim the other cases against him also have no legal merit, McLaughlin said.\n\nTrump faces federal and state charges in Washington and Georgia of trying to overturn his 2020 loss to Biden and federal charges in Florida of mishandling classified documents after leaving the White House in 2021. He has pleaded not guilty in all three cases.\n\n\"It's great fodder for him,\" McLaughlin said. \"He will say, 'I won this sham trial, this witch hunt in New York, and that's what's going to happen with the other trials.'\"\n\nReuters/Ipsos has not polled on how an acquittal would affect voters' views of the presidential race.\n\nKaren Finney, a Democratic consultant who worked in the Clinton White House, said for Trump's core supporters \"an acquittal will make them feel vindicated and validated.\"\n\nBut she said the lurid details that came out in trial testimony and the case's central allegation - that Trump arranged a hush money payment to a porn star - could still damage him even if jurors find him not guilty.\n\n\"What's come out during the case could turn off these suburban women that Trump still has a problem with,\" Finney said, although she said he would play an acquittal as a \"huge victory.\"\n\nThe Biden campaign is preparing a statement to be issued after a verdict that will remind supporters that \"the only way to beat Trump is at the ballot box,\" said an official familiar with the campaign's strategy.\n\nHung Jury\n\nIf the 12 jurors hearing Trump's case can't agree on an unanimous verdict, the result will be a hung jury and the judge will have to declare a mistrial, legal experts say.\n\nTrump will spin a mistrial as a victory, the political consultants and analysts said, but without the validation that an acquittal would give him.\n\nThe trial has kept Trump in the news, something he likes, said John Feehery, a Republican consultant who has worked for congressional leaders. A mistrial would end that, he said, while simultaneously not giving Trump a \"clean bill of health.\"\n\nDemocratic consultant Finney said that, whatever the verdict, Trump is expected to then be free of a gag order imposed by the trial judge. She expects Trump to lash out at his perceived enemies in even harsher ways once the trial concludes.\n\nRegardless of a hung jury, Finney added, the tawdry facts of the case are now in the public domain. A mistrial will also tell voters that at least some jurors believed Trump was guilty, she said.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "What Will the Stock Market Do as Election Nears?\nIn the heart of a political showdown, as the nation edges closer to the 2024 presidential face-off between Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris and her Republican challenger, former President Donald Trump, a different kind of battleground is quietly brewing \u2014 the financial markets. Investors are aligning their sights not just on the political horizon, but on the ripples the election might send through the economic landscape.\n\nAs the election season dominates headlines and newscasts, investors may be tempted to adjust their portfolios to keep pace with the heated clashes and escalated rhetoric. But before taking any meaningful action, it\u2019s important to view things through a historical lens to uncover layers of financial resilience that challenge the notion of election-year market volatility.\n\nHistorical stock market trends during presidential election years\n\nThe historical stock market trends during U.S. presidential election years reveal a fascinating interplay between politics and market performance, shedding light on strategic investment decisions and long-term financial planning. Since 1952, the S&P 500 has experienced an average gain of 7% during presidential election years, as reported in U.S. News & World Report.\n\nSubscribe to Kiplinger\u2019s Personal Finance Be a smarter, better informed investor.

A declining market prior to the election has often been an indicator of the incumbent party's defeat.\n\nA report from BlackRock found that despite the political party in power, the stock market has maintained an average return of 11.6% during election years since 1926, slightly outperforming its overall average annual return. Interestingly, a T. Rowe Price report found that the year following a Democratic win sees an average market gain of 11.3%, compared to 6.6% after a Republican victory.\n\nElection year volatility and investor behavior\n\nElection years bring their own brand of market volatility, which tends to be lower on average, except in the immediate months before and after the election. Notably, the T. Rowe Price report found that market turbulence spikes if the incumbent party is expected to lose but usually stabilizes post-election.\n\nThe government's composition, whether under single-party control or a divided government, has varied impacts on market performance. While single-party dominance shows no significant correlation with market trends, according to a U.S. Bank report, a divided government has been statistically linked to market performance, providing evidence that the balance of power influences market dynamics more than the controlling party itself.\n\nLong-term investment perspective during election cycles\n\nBeyond the electoral cycle, economic indicators such as growth rates, interest rates, inflation and corporate earnings hold more sway over market returns than election outcomes. Therefore, while the election may cause more buzz and excitement, it is important for investors to focus on broader economic trends rather than short-term election-related noise, aligning with long-term strategic investment goals.\n\nHistorical data highlights the minimal long-term effects of elections on market performance, with the S&P 500 showing resilience and positive returns regardless of the electoral cycle. Economic and inflation trends consistently outweigh electoral outcomes, so it is wise to maintain a steady investment approach based on market fundamentals.\n\nInvestors should consider maintaining diversified strategies and avoid making hasty decisions based on short-term volatility, with long-term data reinforcing the value of adhering to a well-considered investment plan. This strategic focus on economic growth, interest rates, inflation and corporate earnings is critical to navigating the uncertainties of election cycles while pursuing long-term financial objectives. Despite the speculative fears and heightened discussions around the immediate impacts of election outcomes, the long-term influence on market performance remains marginal.\n\nSecurities and investment advisory services offered through Osaic Wealth, Inc. member FINRA/SIPC.

        "text": "Early voting starts in 2024 NJ primary election\nCredit: (Colleen O'Dea/NJ Spotlight News)\n\nWednesday is the first day New Jersey voters can go to polling places across the state to cast early in-person ballots in this year\u2019s primary election, which features the presidential race, one U.S. Senate seat and all 12 of the state\u2019s seats in the House of Representatives. And voters can choose party candidates in local and county races.\n\nMore than 235,000 people have already voted in the state, using mail-in ballots. Primary day is next Tuesday, with traditional neighborhood polling sites open from 6 a.m. through 8 p.m.\n\nThis is the first presidential election for which New Jersey has had early in-person voting, first implemented here for the 2021 general election. Since then, the turnout for early machine voting in primaries has been underwhelming, with fewer than 30,000 choosing this method in the first two primaries in which it was offered.\n\nThis year could be different, though, because it is a presidential election year when turnout tends to be highest. And early in-person voting will be open for five days \u2014 Wednesday through Sunday \u2014 instead of three during nonpresidential years. Early polling centers are open 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. through Saturday and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Sunday. Voters can cast ballots at any early-voting location in the county where they live. Locations are listed on the sample ballots sent to registered voters and are available on the state Division of Elections website.\n\nWe\u2019re in this together For a better-informed future. Support our nonprofit newsroom. Donate to NJ Spotlight\n\nMany more voters have embraced mail-in balloting, with the percentage of voters choosing to send ballots or place them in a secure drop box climbing over the years.\n\nThrough last Friday, county clerks had received close to 236,000 paper ballots, about a third of the total mailed to potential voters. As in the past, more Democrats than Republicans used mail-in ballots: More than three-quarters of those already submitted were by registered Democrats.\n\nLackluster turnout\n\nContested House races so far have not proven a major draw for early voters. The most mail-in ballots submitted so far \u2014 more than 43,000 \u2014 were in the 1st District, which includes Camden County, where voters have long embraced mail-in voting. The 3rd District in Burlington, Mercer and Monmouth counties, the only one with an open seat in the June 4 primary, had the second-largest mail-in ballot turnout. But two other races in which incumbents face serious challengers \u2014 the 8th District based in Hudson County and the 9th in Passaic County \u2014 have seen fewer than 10,000 mail-in ballots each so far.\n\nOverall, turnout in New Jersey\u2019s primary elections tends to be low, which some activists blame on the state\u2019s closed primary system. Only those affiliated with one of the major parties can vote for their party\u2019s candidates. Unaffiliated voters can choose to vote for one party\u2019s candidates, but they must affiliate with that party to do so, and most don\u2019t bother.\n\nLast spring, when legislative races topped the balloting, 605,000 people voted in the primary, representing about 10% of all registered voters and nearly 15% of Democrats and Republicans. The last presidential primary, in 2020, had a higher turnout: Nearly 1.47 million people voted, roughly a quarter of all registered voters and about 40% of partisans.\n\nNew Jersey also does not permit same-day voter registration, so only those who are already registered can vote.\n\nPatrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute, said the magnitude of this year\u2019s turnout is unclear.\n\n\u201cPrimary turnout in the past two cycles has been about 26%. This is already more than double what it is in any other year, including years when statewide offices have been up for grabs,\u201d he said. \u201cThere could be a small bump from a presidential protest vote on the Democratic side, but there isn\u2019t an alternative option for Republicans.\u201d\n\nThe candidates\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is the only Republican candidate for president on the primary ballot. On the Democratic side, in addition to President Joe Biden and Terrisa Bukovinac, who is running on an anti-abortion platform, there is a slate of uncommitted delegates. Some Democrats nationally have been voting uncommitted as a protest to try to gain a ceasefire in Gaza and end U.S. military aid to Israel. Nationally, voting uncommitted has drawn more than 10% of the Democratic vote in some states.\n\nThere are contests for both the Democratic and Republican nominations for the state\u2019s open U.S. Senate seat, currently held by Democrat Bob Menendez. Menendez is on trial in federal court, facing corruption and bribery charges, as well as repeated calls to resign his office. He has said he would not run in the primary but may run in November \u201cas an independent Democrat.\u201d\n\nOne of the most competitive House races is for Rep. Andy Kim\u2019s 3rd Congressional District seat.\n\nDemocratic primary ballots will look different this year in part because of that Senate primary. Rep. Andy Kim, who is giving up his 3rd District seat in the House to run for the Senate, filed a federal lawsuit and won an injunction earlier this year that bans the use of the traditional party line ballot on the Democratic side. So in this election, Democratic candidates are being grouped together based on office sought. Because no Republican was originally part of that suit, the judge\u2019s ruling did not apply to GOP ballots and they will be grouped along the party line, as in the past.\n\nKim, considered the front-runner because of party endorsements and a $4 million campaign account, faces labor advocate Patricia Campos-Medina and social-justice activist Larry Hamm in the Democratic primary. On the Republican side, South Jersey hotelier Curtis Bashaw and Mendham Mayor Christine Serrano Glassner are the lead contenders in a four-person field that also includes Justin Murphy and Albert Harshaw. So far Bashaw has outspent Serrano Glassner 4 to 1, but she is hoping Trump\u2019s endorsement of her will win out.\n\nRaces to watch\n\nOne of the most competitive House races is for Kim\u2019s seat in the House. Five Democrats and four Republicans are seeking the nomination. In the Democratic race, Assemblyman Herb Conaway has gotten party endorsements and raised more money, while Assemblywoman Carol Murphy, with whom he serves in the 7th District in the state Legislature, has name recognition and gained the endorsement of the Philadelphia Inquirer. Among the Republican field, Rajesh Mohan has gotten GOP party and leader endorsements, but Shirley Maia-Cusick has raised the most money.\n\nAnd Rep. Rob Menendez (D-8th) is defending his seat against a strong challenge from Hoboken Mayor Ravi Bhalla in the district that covers parts of Hudson, Essex and Union counties. Menendez is the Democratic organization candidate but could suffer both from the lack of the party line ballot and from potential voter backlash against his father and the corruption allegations against him. Bhalla has raised more money than Menendez this cycle, but Menendez had about twice as much money in the bank as of mid-May for final get-out-the-vote efforts and advertising. Kyle Fort Jasey is also on the Democratic ballot.\n\nInformation about all the races, including candidates\u2019 answers to key issue questions, is available at the NJ Spotlight News congressional voter\u2019s guide.\n\nThe elections page includes links to stories about the races, as well as key information about voting, including how to check your voter registration and the locations of polling places and drop boxes.",

        "text": "Trump promises crackdown on pro-Palestinian protests if elected\nTrump tells donors that the student demonstrators are part of a \u2018radical revolution\u2019 and promises to defeat them.\n\nFormer United States President Donald Trump has promised that he will crack down on pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses if he wins the 2024 US presidential election.\n\nEarlier this month, the likely Republican nominee told a small group of predominantly Jewish donors that he would expel student demonstrators, who he claimed were part of a \u201cradical revolution\u201d, from the US if he is elected, according to a report by The Washington Post released on Monday.\n\n\u201cIf you get me elected, and you should really be doing this \u2026 we\u2019re going to set that movement back 25 or 30 years,\u201d Trump said, according to the report, quoting people at the meeting who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nThe former president also praised the New York police for clearing the campus at Columbia University in late April, and said the other cities needed to follow suit, saying \u201cit has to be stopped now\u201d.\n\nStudent protests against the Israeli war on Gaza have rocked the US over the past few weeks, prompting a police crackdown on many campuses and more than 2,000 arrests.\n\nIn mid-April, Columbia University saw a Gaza solidarity encampment, with students urging the institution to divest from companies associated with Israel. This movement spread to campuses in California, Texas, and many other states.\n\nUniversity administrators accused pro-Palestinian demonstrators of using anti-Semitic language and creating an unsafe environment on campus. But students rejected those claims, which they said aimed to distract people from what is happening in the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe majority of Americans below 30 years of age want a ceasefire in Gaza, according to a poll.\n\nDuring the donors\u2019 meeting in New York on May 14, Trump expressed his support for Israel\u2019s right to continue \u201cits war on terror\u201d and highlighted his policies towards Israel if he is elected. He has previously said Israel was \u201closing the PR war\u201d with its actions in Gaza.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re losing the PR war. They\u2019re losing it big. But they\u2019ve got to finish what they started,\u201d Trump said during an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt.\n\nAccording to the report, Trump did not mention Netanyahu, who provoked the Republican\u2019s ire when he acknowledged President Joe Biden was rightfully elected in 2020.\n\nIsraeli attacks on Gaza since the start of the war have killed more than 36,000 people, with 81,026 others wounded and thousands more missing, presumed dead under the rubble. Israel launched its assault on the besieged territory after a Hamas-led attack in southern Israel killed about 1,140 people.",

        "text": "Who is Claudia Sheinbaum, Mexico\u2019s first female president-elect?\nLong tied to outgoing President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, will Sheinbaum be able to carve out a new path?\n\nMexico City, Mexico \u2013 She is poised to become Mexico\u2019s first female president, after winning a historic mandate in the country\u2019s June 2 election.\n\nBut Claudia Sheinbaum faces a challenge: how to distinguish herself from her political mentor, current President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, popularly known as AMLO.\n\nRepresenting the left-leaning Morena party, Sheinbaum campaigned in Lopez Obrador\u2019s image, embracing many of his trademark projects and policies.\n\nBut experts say her personal history and past governing experience offer valuable clues about how her tenure in office might differ from Lopez Obrador\u2019s.\n\n\u201cSheinbaum has always been disciplined and strategic,\u201d said Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera, a Mexican political analyst. \u201cShe\u2019s not going to be as radical as AMLO.\u201d\n\nA mix of academics and politics\n\nThe former head of Mexico City\u2019s government, Sheinbaum was born into a family of Jewish heritage, and she initially followed her parents into the field of science.\n\nShe studied physics and then energy engineering, pursuing research for her doctoral degree at the University of California, Berkeley in the United States.\n\nBut early on, Sheinbaum also mirrored her parents\u2019 commitment to political engagement, becoming involved in student activism. On the campaign trail, she often credits her parents\u2019 involvement in the 1968 student protests as an inspiration for her own work.\n\n\u201cI have always said it: I am a daughter of \u201968,\u201d she wrote on social media in April.\n\nHer transition to a political career came under Lopez Obrador\u2019s wing. In a campaign video chronicling her life, Sheinbaum explained that she and Lopez Obrador often participated in the same protests and activist work, but it was only in 2000, a week after he was elected mayor of Mexico City, that she was formally introduced to him during a meeting at her house.\n\nAfterwards, Lopez Obrador called Sheinbaum with a proposition. \u201cHe told me, \u2018Would you like to be secretary of the environment?\u2019 I told him \u2018yes\u2019.\u201d\n\nIn the decades since, she has campaigned on Lopez Obrador\u2019s behalf, while forging her own academic and political career, including as mayor of Tlalpan.\n\nIn 2018, she became the first woman elected to lead Mexico City, a high-profile position often seen as a launchpad for future presidential bids. She resigned from the post in June 2023 to seek her party\u2019s presidential nomination.\n\nIn the shadow of a popular president\n\nFrom the moment the Morena party tapped her as its nominee last September, Sheinbaum was the frontrunner in the 2024 presidential race.\n\nBut her campaign was buoyed in large part by the popularity of the outgoing president.\n\nThe online survey company Morning Consult has consistently ranked Lopez Obrador among the most popular heads of state currently in power, after India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi \u2014 a fact he is known to repeat in his daily news conferences.\n\nBut Mexican presidents are limited to a single six-year term, and Lopez Obrador is therefore barred from running in the 2024 race.\n\nThe circumstances surrounding his 2018 election were historic, though \u2014 and they continued to cast a shadow over this year\u2019s race.\n\nBorn in the often-overlooked southern state of Tabasco, Lopez Obrador was something of an underdog in 2018, having lost the two previous presidential races. Critics dismissed the then-64-year-old as a populist past his prime.\n\nHis victory, however, was ultimately a landslide: Lopez Obrador was the first candidate since Mexico\u2019s transition to democracy to score more than 50 percent of the vote.\n\nBy contrast, Sheinbaum\u2019s solid lead in the polls \u2014 and her urban, academic upbringing \u2014 projected a different public image, distinct from Lopez Obrador\u2019s dark-horse campaign, according to Correa-Cabrera, the political analyst.\n\n\u201cAside from being a progressive politician, she\u2019s never been distant from the elite,\u201d Correa-Cabrera explained.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s obedient to international institutions and economic systems,\u201d the analyst added, pointing to Sheinbaum\u2019s sunny relationship with Carlos Slim, the wealthiest man in Mexico.\n\nEven Sheinbaum\u2019s leading opponent, Xochitl Galvez, slammed her for her relatively privileged background.\n\n\u201cWhile you were dancing ballet at 10 years old, I had to work,\u201d Galvez told Sheinbaum during a televised debate on May 19.\n\nCorrea-Cabrera also notes that Sheinbaum styles herself more as a pragmatist and less as a firebrand, in contrast to Lopez Obrador. While Lopez Obrador is known to speak off the cuff, for instance, Sheinbaum\u2019s public appearances are more scripted.\n\nRefuting the \u2018puppet\u2019 label\n\nNevertheless, Sheinbaum has long faced criticism that she is \u201cthe puppet\u201d \u2014 la titere \u2014 of the man she hopes to succeed as president.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care about those things the opposition says, that mine would be another Lopez Obrador government,\u201d she told the BBC earlier this year.\n\nLopez Obrador himself addressed the criticisms from the podium at one of his daily press briefings in January.\n\n\u201cThere are no puppets with power,\u201d he said, with a nod to Sheinbaum. \u201cNo one accepts to be manipulated when they reach public office.\u201d\n\nStill, Sheinbaum has adopted many of Lopez Obrador\u2019s signature moves.\n\nIn March, for instance, she released a list of 100 commitments to achieve if elected, her version of a similar list Lopez Obrador released upon taking office, featuring 100 of his top priorities.\n\nSheinbaum\u2019s list repeats her mentor\u2019s antipoverty rallying cry: \u201cFor the good of all, the poor come first.\u201d It also includes the continuation of Lopez Obrador\u2019s controversial Tren Maya or Mayan Train, a $28bn infrastructure project to build a rail line through the Yucatan Peninsula.\n\nLocal activists have criticised the project for destroying thousand-year-old Mayan artefacts and archaeological sites, as well as damaging the natural environment.\n\nBut Lopez Obrador has defended the project as a means of bringing tourist dollars to impoverished areas, though critics have expressed doubt that the local population will ever see genuine cash flow.\n\nCombatting climate change\n\nGiven her career as a scientist, one of the most scrutinised aspects of Sheinbaum\u2019s platform is her stance on climate change.\n\nHer 100 commitments include a goal to \u201cpromote renewable energies\u201d through the construction of wind, solar, geothermal and hydrogen-based sources.\n\nAnd Sheinbaum herself contributed to a 2007 report on climate change that won the Nobel Peace Prize that year.\n\nBut critics have accused her of embracing her party\u2019s environmental platform, which offers no plan to cut fossil fuel emissions and includes further investments in the state-owned petroleum industry, Pemex.\n\nCorrea-Cabrera said Sheinbaum\u2019s \u201ceducation as a climate scientist\u201d is only one part of Sheinbaum\u2019s identity.\n\n\u201cHer political career is a different thing,\u201d Correa-Cabrera explained. She believes Sheinbaum \u201cis going to be following the guidelines of oil and gas [interests] and of the United States and China\u201d once in office.\n\nHowever, Adrian Fernandez, director of the Mexico Climate Initiative, thinks the growing threats that climate change presents, especially to Mexico\u2019s agricultural industry, will force politicians like Sheinbaum to tackle the issue more forcefully.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a question of hope. I am very sure the next president will shift to address climate change because it is a necessity,\u201d he said.\n\nSecurity a top concern\n\nSecurity was also a top concern as Mexican voters prepared to head to the ballot box on June 2.\n\nTyler Mattiace, a researcher at Human Rights Watch in Mexico, voiced scepticism that any candidate would reverse Lopez Obrador\u2019s decision to expand the country\u2019s military, a decision he fears will lead to greater abuses, not greater safety.\n\n\u201cAt this point, you can\u2019t really put the toothpaste back in the tube,\u201d he said.\n\nAlready, Lopez Obrador has granted the military control over several airports and infrastructure projects. He has also attempted to shift control of the civilian-led National Guard to the army, despite court challenges.\n\nBut critics like Mattiace say there are credible allegations that military members often abuse their power \u2014 or enter into corrupt relations with cartels and other criminal organisations.\n\nMexico has seen more than 30,000 murders per year for five straight years. In 2022, the total number of missing people in Mexico surpassed 100,000, a number that Lopez Obrador has publicly disputed.\n\nThe majority of those disappearances \u2014 approximately 97 percent \u2014 are believed to have happened after 2006, when Mexico\u2019s \u201cwar on drugs\u201d began, and Mexican military troops were deployed to the streets, setting off a period of heightened conflict in which the military did anything but address violence.\n\nBoth Sheinbaum and her rival Galvez promised to address the disappearances, as part of their plan to tackle Mexico\u2019s crime.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the only one who can show results in security,\u201d Sheinbaum said in the last debate, citing her track record as head of Mexico City\u2019s government.\n\nShe has also called the \u201cwar on drugs\u201d an \u201cabsurd, terrible decision\u201d and promised to address the root causes of crime through social welfare programmes.\n\nBut voters like Yolanda Moran Isais, whose son Dan Jeremeel Fernandez Moran went missing in 2008, fear Sheinbaum will continue Lopez Obrador\u2019s habit of downplaying the extent of the disappearances.\n\nMoran Isais leads a group of volunteers who search for the missing in the Mexican state of Coahuila. She expressed disappointment that Sheinbaum refused to meet with a nationwide delegation of mothers leading the search effort.\n\n\u201cWhat we need from the next president is recognition,\u201d she said. \u201cSo far, Claudia Sheinbaum has not even acknowledged us.\u201d\n\nBut another searcher, Cynthia Gutierrez from Mexico City, said Sheinbaum might offer hope to the movement. She gave a nod to the prospect of Sheinbaum becoming Mexico\u2019s first female president \u2014 not to mention her identity as a mother and grandmother.\n\n\u201cShe is a woman,\u201d Gutierrez said. \u201cMaybe she will empathise with our cause.\u201d",

        "summary": " The 2024 election is a big year for farm policy as well as farm policy . Congress has yet to pass a farm bill before the presidential election . Some lawmakers are concerned that the farm bill will be trapped in the \u2018lame-duck session\u2019",
        "text": "The Future of Farm Policy and Road to 2024 Election\nWith the 2024 election on the horizon, farm policy is finding itself once again at the center of the discussion.\n\nNot only is 2024 an election year, but after a farm bill extension was passed in 2023, it also became a big year for farm policy as well. As the presidential election nears, it\u2019s more important than ever for rural landowners to know what farm policies are being proposed and how they could impact their agribusiness and the farm community.\n\nIn this article, we explain upcoming farm policy updates, what farmers are saying about it, and how the presidential election could shape its future.\n\n1. Farm Bill\n\nAfter failing to meet the deadline in September 2023, Congress passed a year-long extension, allowing the 2018 farm bill to continue through September 2024. Although some members of Congress expressed optimism that the bill would be passed in December of 2023, we have yet to see promising movement\u2014until recently.\n\nIn May 2024, House Republicans released a $1.5 billion proposal that sparked backlash on both sides of the aisle, mostly due to disagreements regarding nutrition spending and crop insurance reform. \u201cThe farm bill is a safety net for our families and the farmers who feed, fuel, and clothe us. Unfortunately, the bill that\u2019s been proposed by Agriculture Committee Chairman Thompson fails the Heartland in both of these critical missions,\u201d said Nikki Budzinski, an Illinois Representative.\n\nOn the Senate side, Ag Chair Debbie Stabenow revealed a competing framework ahead of the House bill\u2019s release, stating that her bill was a \u201cserious proposal that reflects bipartisan priorities.\u201d\n\nIndustry leaders and lawmakers are watching the clock closely as Congress deliberates over the proposed farm bill policies. Many groups like the Indiana Farm Bureau (INFB) believe reaching a consensus before the election is critical. \u201cDuring a presidential election year, there are fewer legislative days,\u201d said Brantley Seifers, INFB national affairs director. All House members and much of the Senate will be up for re-election, and the fear of the farm bill being trapped in the \u201clame-duck session\u201d is growing.\n\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t pass a farm bill in the second quarter of 2024, who knows when they\u2019re going to get around to it?\u201d Seifers said. \u201cYou just don\u2019t know who you\u2019ll be dealing with.\u201d\n\n2. FARMER Act\n\nThe Federal Agriculture Risk Management Enhancement and Resilience (FARMER) Act aims to increase crop insurance and provide additional protections under the Supplemental Coverage Option (SCO). One of the main bottlenecks for the farm bill has been disagreements over crop insurance\u2014and how much funding should be allocated toward it.\n\nOpponents of increased crop insurance have long maintained that it drains taxpayers while benefiting large corporations and leaving more diversified family farm operations with nothing.\n\n\u201cBoth of the FARMER Act\u2019s proposed changes to crop insurance would drive up taxpayer costs for an already expensive program. The program currently costs billions of dollars each year yet mostly benefits the largest and wealthiest farms, which do not need more taxpayer support,\u201d said Anne Schechinger, EWG\u2019s Midwest director.\n\nSupporters of expanded crop insurance argue it\u2019s a necessary tool that keeps farms afloat in hard seasons. \u201cCrop insurance is the farmer\u2019s number one tool to deal with climate and weather uncertainty,\u201d said Tom Zacharias, National Crop Insurance Services president.\n\nWithout crop insurance, supporters worry our food supply may be at risk. Senator John Hoeven explained: \u201cOur farmers and ranchers produce the highest-quality, lowest-cost food supply in the world and every American benefits from that every single day. It\u2019s brought to us by our farmers and ranchers. Americans spend less of their budget than any other developed country on their food and they have better food and a better choice. It\u2019s national security\u2014we don\u2019t have to worry about food security.\u201d\n\n3. SOLAR Act\n\nOutside of the farm bill, several other proposed legislations are in the works. For example, Illinois Congressman Mike Bost introduced the Securing Our Lands and Resources (SOLAR) Act to protect prime farmland as solar installation rapidly increases in popularity. With the rise of solar energy installation nationwide, concern over protecting agriculturally productive land is growing. In fact, a 2022 study found 83 percent of new solar projects are installed on farmland and ranchlands, with almost 50 percent placed on the most productive, versatile, and resilient land.\n\nSome legislators, like Bost, are concerned that this transition to solar will eliminate more of America\u2019s precious farmland. Others, like a specialty crop farmer in California, argue that solar has become a crucial source of income for farmers and ranchers across the nation, with some estimating landowners could earn $1,200 per acre annually by converting to solar.\n\n4. Ransomware and Cybersecurity\n\nThe U.S. food and agriculture sector dealt with at least 167 ransomware attacks in 2023, but this is nothing new\u2014ransomware attacks have been plaguing the sector for some time. Most notably, the sector was hit with the fourth-largest ransomware attack in history back in 2021, when JBS Foods was forced to pay out an $11 million ransom, and the loss of business caused a meat shortage in a large portion of the Western United States.\n\n\u201cOne could \u2018lose the farm\u2019 because of an unforeseen cyberattack,\u201d said Steve Cubbage, precision ag consultant for Farmobile. \u201cIf you are a farmer who has connected data to the \u2018cloud,\u2019 or the CEO of a co-op, you are a target, and this threat is not going away.\u201d\n\nRansomware attacks are a growing concern, as they have the potential to disrupt agricultural production. This concern has prompted several new bills to help battle the threat.\n\nThe Farm and Food Cybersecurity Act\n\nBipartisan legislation released back in January attempts to address the cybersecurity concerns of our U.S. food system. The Farm and Food Cybersecurity Act aims to strengthen cybersecurity in the agriculture and food sectors by requiring the Secretary of Agriculture to conduct a study of cyber threats every two years and run practice drills every year with help from other agencies, including the Director of National Intelligence. This will help these sectors be more aware of potential threats, fix security weaknesses, and respond better to incidents like ransomware attacks.\n\nFood and Agriculture Industry Cybersecurity Support Act\n\nThe Food and Agriculture Industry Cybersecurity Support Act aims to establish a hub that aids farmers in procuring new technology to protect their operations from hackers.\n\nCybersecurity for Rural Water Systems Act\n\nThe Cybersecurity for Rural Water Systems Act aims to expand existing programs that manage cybersecurity for small water and wastewater utilities.\n\n5. TikTok Ban\n\nLastly, many farmers leveraging TikTok to market their businesses are paying close attention to the recently passed TikTok ban. This bill was included as part of a larger $95 billion package that provided foreign aid to Ukraine and Israel.\n\nTikTok has grown in popularity amongst many young farmers and homesteaders, promoting rural lifestyles and encouraging more young people to seek careers in agriculture. The ban has the potential to deprive these influencers of their platforms. Not only that, but it could potentially deprive farmers of an important online community.\n\n\u201c\u201cI\u2019ve seen times where farmers will post a video with a problem, like some piece of equipment that they\u2019re not sure how to fix, asking for help. And you\u2019ll see the comment section is just filled,\u201d said Joshua Westerfeld, a cattle farmer and TikTok creator with more than 185K followers.\n\nOne cattle farmer, Brian Firebaugh, is suing to ensure TikTok stays in business. \u201cIt\u2019s 100 percent of my customer base,\u201d Firebaugh explained, \u201cWhen you talk about pulling this out, you\u2019re pulling away 100 percent of my customer base.\u201d\n\nThe battle is expected to have real repercussions as different groups attempt to find a middle ground between national security and free speech.\n\nStay Informed on the Latest Farm Policy Updates\n\nFarm policy is ever-changing, and as we edge closer to the election, it is vital for farmers to stay informed on policies that may impact their way of life.

        "text": "Stock Market Performance by President (in Charts)\nAs the next U.S. presidential election nears, investors may be wondering what the implications are for their investments. How will the stock market react if the incumbent (President Biden) wins? What will markets do if the current Democratic administration is replaced by a Republican one? How does the stock market perform when Republicans or Democrats have control of Congress vs when it\u2019s mixed? Although volatility is often heightened during an election year, historically, US stocks have ended the year with gains more frequently compared to non-election years.\n\nThe good news is that over the long-term, the stock market has performed well under all types of presidential administrations. Here are several charts to illustrate the stock and bond market performance by president.\n\nU.S. Stock market performance by president (S&P 500)\n\nUnder both Democratic and Republican presidents, the stock market has generally performed well with an upward trajectory over the long-term. It\u2019s important to keep in mind the myriad of other factors that impact stock market performance aside from who is elected as president of the United States. For example, the September 11th terrorist attacks and the 2008 Great Financial Crisis occurred under President G.W. Bush.\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s term, starting in 2009, began when stock market valuations were near the bottom and as is well documented now, the stock market went on to its longest bull market in history. The impact of policy here can be debated, but the key takeaway is the limited control any administration has and the impact unanticipated and uncontrollable events can have for or against the stock market.\n\nAnnualized U.S. stock market returns during presidential terms\n\nSince 1929, only three presidents have experienced negative returns for the S&P 500 on an annualized basis over the course of their term(s). The average annualized return for a president\u2019s term is over 9.5%.\n\nAnnualized bond returns during presidential terms\n\nAs expected, the volatility in the bond market is much less than equities. Since 1977, only president Biden his tracking to have negative annualized fixed income returns over the course of their administration.\n\nJust like the stock market, the president does not control the bond market, either. Monetary policy, interest rates, and inflation are key factors in driving bond returns. While the president has a say in shaping the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, the process involves a series of checks and balances, much like other aspects of our system. Interest rates, which had generally been declining since the 1980s, increased at their fastest pace in recent history in 2022 as the Federal Reserve seeks to tame inflation.\n\nHow does the S&P 500 perform during election years?\n\nThe markets hate uncertainty more than bad news. A presidential election means the possibility for significant change. Historically, Republicans have valued lower taxes and less regulation (both of which the market likes), but as evidenced in earlier charts, that doesn\u2019t necessarily translate to higher returns during an administration.\n\nInvestment returns during an election year are generally driven by a blend of factors. Here are some:\n\nWhether the incumbent president running for reelection\n\nEconomic/geopolitical climate and expectations\n\nHow close (and unpredictable) the election is\n\nKey issues of candidate and perceived threat to the stock market (e.g. higher taxes, repeal of business-friendly programs, increased regulation)\n\nLikelihood of one party controlling Congress after the election\n\nPerformance of U.S. stocks during election years vs non-election years\n\nAlthough historically the S&P 500 has a higher average annual return during non-election years versus election years (previous chart), election years have historically rewarded investors with gains more often than non-election years (chart below). Since 1926, U.S. stocks ended an election year in the red only four times (17%). All were a result of major geopolitical or financial market events versus the election itself. Contrast this with non-election years, and the S&P 500 experienced annual losses nearly twice as often (30%).\n\nU.S. stock market performance during Democratic, Republican, and mixed party control of Congress\n\nMixed control of the House and the Senate means more roadblocks to either party\u2019s agenda. This leads to slower change or no change at all. Since the markets are afraid of uncertainty, the status quo might be welcome news. The chart below shows how relatively infrequently there\u2019s a mixed Congress. In either case, it\u2019s impossible to identify any trends when zooming out and looking at the bigger picture over time, as long-term investors should. The stock market is not the economy or the White House for that matter.\n\nAccording to data from YCharts, since 1950, the mix by political party in Congress and the White House that yielded the highest average annual returns for the S&P 500 is a Democratic president and divided Congress.\n\nHow to manage your investments during an election year\n\nShould you make changes to your asset allocation during an election year or after a new president is elected? Probably not. Focusing on what you can control is key when investing for the long-term.

        "text": "Missouri Man Pleads Guilty to Assaulting Law Enforcement and Other Charges During Jan. 6 Capitol Breach\nWASHINGTON \u2013 A Missouri man pleaded guilty today to multiple felony and misdemeanor charges, including assaulting law enforcement during the Jan. 6, 2021, breach of the U.S. Capitol. His actions and the actions of others disrupted a joint session of the U.S. Congress convened to ascertain and count the electoral votes related to the 2020 presidential election.\n\nKyler Joseph Bard, 27, of Seneca, Missouri, pleaded guilty to two felonies, including assaulting, resisting, or impeding certain officers and civil disorder. In addition to the felonies, Bard pleaded guilty to four misdemeanors, including entering or remaining in a restricted building or grounds, disorderly or disruptive conduct in a restricted building or grounds, engaging in physical violence in a restricted building or grounds, and act of physical violence at the Capitol building or grounds.\n\nU.S. District Judge Amit P. Mehta will sentence Bard on Nov. 1, 2024.\n\nAccording to court documents, On the morning of Jan. 6, 2021, Bard attended the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally in Washington, D.C., with other individuals near the Washington Monument. After the rally, Bard returned to his hotel and later made his way to the Upper West Terrace of the Capitol, entering and remaining on the restricted grounds. Here, Bard took a picture of a rioter holding up and posing with a sign that read \u201cArea Closed By Order of the Capitol Police Board.\u201d\n\nBy approximately 3:28 p.m., court documents say that Bard was standing on a ledge on the Upper West Terrace where officers had formed a police line as a barrier between the Capitol building and the crowd. At approximately 3:30 p.m., Bard walked on top of the ledge, carrying a megaphone, and shortly thereafter, another individual near him charged the police line and pushed into the officers. In response to seeing this, Bard yelled into the megaphone, \u201cMove! Move! Move! We gotta push! We gotta push! Let\u2019s go! We gotta go! Let\u2019s go!\u201d Bard then turned directly toward the police line, and, as he yelled, \u201cLet\u2019s push!\u201d took several steps and shoved a police officer.\n\nCourt documents say that for approximately 4 seconds, Bard confronted a police officer by physically moving into the officer. Bard then lost his balance and fell backward to the ground. As Bard fell backward, he yelled to the officers, \u201cYou\u2019re all a bunch of pieces of s\u2014.\u201d\n\nThe FBI arrested Bard on Jan. 17, 2023, in Missouri.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Columbia and the Department of Justice National Security Division\u2019s Counterterrorism Section are prosecuting this case. The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Western District of Missouri provided valuable assistance.\n\nThis case was investigated by the FBI\u2019s Kansas City and Washington Field Offices, which identified Bard as BOLO AFO (Be on the Lookout Assault on Federal Officer) #447 on its seeking information photos. Valuable assistance was provided by the U.S. Capitol Police and the Metropolitan Police Department.\n\nIn the 40 months since Jan. 6, 2021, more than 1,424 individuals have been charged in nearly all 50 states for crimes related to the breach of the U.S. Capitol, including more than 500 individuals charged with assaulting or impeding law enforcement, a felony. The investigation remains ongoing.\n\nAnyone with tips can call 1-800-CALL-FBI (800-225-5324) or visit tips.fbi.gov.",

        "text": "The unusual turnout dynamic that could decide the 2024 election\nCNN \u2014\n\nFor decades, Democrats have built their electoral strategies on a common assumption: the higher the turnout, the better their chances of winning. But that familiar equation may no longer apply for President Joe Biden in 2024.\n\nA wide array of polls this year shows Biden running best among Americans with the most consistent history of voting, while former President Donald Trump often displays the most strength among people who have been the least likely to vote.\n\nThese new patterns are creating challenges for each party. Trump\u2019s potential appeal to more irregular voters, particularly younger Black and Latino men, is compelling Democrats to rethink longstanding strategies that focused on mobilizing as many younger and non-White voters as possible without worrying about their partisan allegiance. For Republicans, the challenge will be to build an organization capable of connecting with irregular voters they have not traditionally focused on reaching, particularly in minority communities.\n\n\u201cWhat all this means is this election has volatility,\u201d says Daniel Hopkins, a University of Pennsylvania political scientist who has studied the widening partisan divergence between voters with and without a consistent history of turning out. \u201cWe used to expect that the marginal non-voter, the next voter who turned out if an election was very engaging, didn\u2019t look different from people who did vote. In this case, the crowd that hasn\u2019t gotten engaged looks very, very different.\u201d\n\nMerged results from the three most recent national NBC polls, conducted by a bipartisan team of prominent Democratic and Republican pollsters, for instance, found that Biden leads Trump by 4 percentage points among people who voted in both 2020 and 2022. But among those who voted in 2020 but not 2022, Trump led Biden by 12 percentage points. Trump\u2019s lead swelled to 20 percentage points among those who did not vote in either 2020 or 2022. Fully 65% of those who did not vote in either of the past two elections said they disapproved of Biden\u2019s performance in office.\n\nCombined results from recent national New York Times/Siena College polls likewise have found Biden narrowly leading among potential 2024 voters who turned out in 2020 while trailing Trump by double digits among those who did not vote in their previous contest.\n\nHopkins has conducted perhaps the most ambitious attempt to quantify the divergence between Americans with and without a history of voting. Earlier this year, he and a colleague worked with NORC at the University of Chicago to survey over 2,400 adults about their preferences in the 2024 race. The poll only surveyed people who were old enough to vote in each of the past three elections \u2014 the midterms of 2018 and 2022 and the 2020 presidential race.\n\nThe results were striking. Among adults who had voted in each of the past three federal elections, Biden led Trump by 11 points, and Biden eked out a narrow advantage among voters who participated in two of the past three races. But, the poll found, Trump led Biden by 12 percentage points among those who voted in just one of the past three elections and by a crushing margin of 18 percentage points among those who came out for none of them.\n\nAs important, the pattern held across racial lines. In the poll, Trump ran even with Biden among Latinos who voted in two, one or none of the past three elections, while Biden held a nearly 20-point advantage among those who voted in all three. With Black voters, Biden\u2019s lead was just 10 points among those who did not show up for any of the past three elections, but over 80 points among those who participated in all three.\n\nUsing data from Catalist, a leading Democratic voter targeting firm, Michael Podhorzer, the former political director of the AFL-CIO, reached similar conclusions. He found that in 2020 Biden\u2019s margins over Trump were higher among people who voted in the three previous elections of 2018, 2016 and 2014 than those who voted in some or none of them \u2014 and that the relationship held across racial lines.\n\nHopkins said the gap between habitual and irregular voters in his latest survey was far greater than the difference he found when he conducted a similar poll early in the 2016 race between Trump and Hillary Clinton. Key to this widening chasm, he believes, may be another dynamic: Adults who are less likely to vote are also less likely to follow political news.\n\n\u201cFor more infrequent voters, these are often people who pay less attention to politics and whose political barometer is more the question of how is my family doing economically, how does the country seem to be doing,\u201d Hopkins said. \u201cFor those voters, Donald Trump\u2026is not especially unusual.\u201d By contrast, Hopkins said, a \u201csizable sliver\u201d of habitual voters \u201chave a sense that Trump may be qualitatively different than other political candidates with respect to norm violations and January 6.\u201d For less frequent voters, he added, the equation may be as simple as \u201cthey don\u2019t love what they see with Joe Biden, and if Donald Trump is the person running against Joe Biden, they want change.\u201d\n\nThe NBC polling results buttress that conclusion: It found that among the roughly one-sixth of voters who say they do not follow political news, Trump led Biden by fully 2-to-1.\n\nSeveral analysts caution that while this divergence between high- and low-frequency voters is appearing consistently in polls now, it\u2019s too early to say for certain whether it will persist through Election Day.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s May,\u201d said Republican pollster Bill McInturff, whose firm conducts the NBC poll with a Democratic partner. \u201cThis data matters when people start having to vote.\u201d Democratic strategist Tom Bonier pointed out that public opinion surveys often have enough trouble measuring attitudes among young people and minorities, let alone accurately capturing those who are most disengaged from the political system.\n\nMelissa Morales \u2014 founder and president of Somos Votantes and Somos PAC, groups that mobilize Latino voters \u2014 said that in their outreach campaigns this year, they are not seeing the tilt toward Trump among low-frequency voters evident in these multiple polls. In their work during 2022, she said, \u201cWe were hearing it in the field, with low propensity Latino voters, they were open to Trump, especially [over] the economy.\u201d But, she added, \u201cWe are not hearing that in the field right now\u201d and instead \u201cwhat we are hearing is deep concern about the cost of living, rising costs, and a strong desire to know what the path forward is.\u201d\n\nEven with all these cautions, there are strong reasons to believe that Trump may benefit more from a very large overall turnout this year than Biden would.\n\nThat conclusion is consistent with the other unusual demographic patterns evident in the 2024 election. So far, in almost all polls, Biden is holding a higher share of his 2020 vote among White than non-White voters; he\u2019s also maintaining more of his 2020 level of support with seniors than with young people. Among Whites, Biden, as in 2020, is running much better with those who hold at least a four-year college degree than those who don\u2019t.\n\nBiden\u2019s relative strength among seniors and college-educated White voters means that he\u2019s drawing from two of the most reliable voting blocs in the electorate. In 2020, about 75% of people older than 65 voted, compared to just 54% of young people aged 18-29, according to calculations from Census data by William Frey, a demographer at Brookings Metro. (Even that was a big increase in turnout among young people from the 2012 and 2016 elections.) Far more White voters with degrees turned out than those without them as well.\n\nTurnout was especially modest among the Black and Latino voters who have shown the most receptivity to Trump \u2014 men without a college degree. Only slightly less than half of them voted in 2020, Frey found.\n\nMost experts who study turnout consider it unlikely that as many people will vote this year as in 2020, largely because so many voters hold negative views about both Biden and Trump. After a record 160 million people voted in 2020, Bonier said his preliminary calculation is that turnout in 2024 is more likely to reach between 145-150 million with the possibility that as few as 140 million people will vote. Jeremy Smith, CEO of Civitech, a Democratic voter data and targeting firm, said that the number of people registered to even potentially vote is way down from the total at this point in the 2020 cycle.\n\n\u201cGenerally, if you said there are two possible electorates \u2014 one is 140 million people voting and one is 160 million people \u2014 the high likelihood is that the 140 would be better for Biden,\u201d said Bonier, a senior adviser and former CEO of TargetSmart, a leading Democratic targeting firm.\n\nIf turnout shrinks from 2020, the key question for the two sides will be which voters fall away \u2014 and how many new voters enter the electorate to replace them.\n\nGenerally, Democrats believe that in the Trump era the party benefits when the most habitual voters comprise a larger share of the electorate. Many Democrats believe that a key reason the party exceeded expectations in the 2022 midterm is that the electorate tilted more than anticipated toward these regular voters. The Democratic polling firm Equis Research, which focuses on Latino voters, for instance, found in its post-election analysis that Democrats performed slightly better than expected with that group largely because irregular Latino voters, who were more receptive to Trump, failed to come out.\n\nMichael Madrid, a long-time GOP strategist who has become a fierce Trump critic, said that the disappointing 2022 results for Republicans showed the risk for the party in the turnout patterns that the former president has triggered. Republicans under Trump, Madrid argued, are gaining support among non-White men, particularly Latinos, while shedding support among college-educated White voters, especially women. The danger for the GOP, Madrid said, is that the latter group turns out at a far higher rate than the former (as Frey\u2019s data shows).\n\nGiven that disparity, Madrid argued, Trump \u201cneeds a high turnout\u201d that pulls in less reliable minority voters, especially Latino men. Trump\u2019s conundrum, Madrid said, is that the belligerent rule-breaking persona that attracts those younger non-White men alienates more of the well-educated White women already trending away from him.\n\n\u201cHe is talking to a single young male between video games: He\u2019s got them, they love him,\u201d Madrid said. \u201cBut there are suburban women that you lose by that, who hate that. That\u2019s his dilemma. He gets the turnout, but he also gets the turnoff.\u201d\n\nThe best-case scenario for Trump is that an unusually large number of these irregularly voting working-class minorities come out to vote for him. Given his success in the past two elections at turning out irregularly voting working-class Whites, no one discounts his chances of turning out irregularly voting working-class non-Whites this time. But it\u2019s hardly guaranteed: Though these voters tend to be strongly discontented with the economy, Democrats believe they can loosen Trump\u2019s hold on them by highlighting his views on other issues, such as his pledges to implement a mass deportation effort against undocumented migrants, or to pardon White supremacists convicted in the January 6, 2021, insurrection. And as Podhorzer argued, unhappiness with the economy historically has not proven to be a powerful force in motivating irregular voters to show up.\n\nBut Republicans point out that even if Trump doesn\u2019t win as many of these irregularly voting non-White men as polls show today, he will still benefit if they drift toward third-party candidates or simply choose not to vote. Looking at the Black community, \u201ceven if you don\u2019t buy the potential for Trump to flip lots of votes there, it seems there\u2019s considerable risk of a turnout drop-off that will hit Biden\u2019s raw margins out of big cities in the battlegrounds that Democrats usually depend on,\u201d said GOP pollster Patrick Ruffini.\n\nFor that reason, many voter mobilization experts say Democrats can\u2019t give up on infrequent voters showing receptivity to Trump. Podhorzer pointed out that Democrats can still benefit from high turnout if the campaign\u2019s final weeks focus on the aspects of Trump\u2019s agenda that most alienate the irregular voters who surged to the polls against him in 2020. Morales said the number of low-frequency Latino voters that Somos PAC turned out in Nevada in 2022 exceeded Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto\u2019s margin of victory there, and the group remains committed to reaching those same voters for Biden.\n\n\u201cNot only can we get them out to vote, but when we have a conversation about the contrast and what their votes mean on the issues, we can win those voters over,\u201d Morales said.\n\nAll of these dynamics may prove most volatile with younger voters. Through the 21st century, as first Millennials and now Generation Z have entered the electorate in large numbers, Democrats have unwaveringly operated on the belief that turning out as many young voters as possible would benefit the party.\n\nBut that\u2019s a much more uncertain proposition in 2024, as demonstrated by the latest youth poll from the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics, probably the most in-depth look at attitudes among young people. In the IOP poll this spring, Biden led Trump by nearly 20 points among young adults (aged 18-29) who said they definitely plan to vote in November; that lead was comparable to Biden\u2019s advantage among all young adults in 2020. But Trump\u2019s position steadily improved as the likelihood of voting diminished, with the former president leading Biden by 2-to-1 among those who said they probably would not vote.\n\nThose who indicated they were less likely to vote tended to be young people without a college degree, non-Whites and the very youngest cohort aged 18-24. John Della Volpe, the Institute of Politics\u2019 polling director, pointed out that those youngest adults probably don\u2019t remember much about Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\n\u201cYounger voters today have a different view of Trump,\u201d said Della Volpe, who advised the Biden campaign in 2020 on young voters. \u201cThey were 10, 12, 13 years old when he descended down that escalator, when he blocked Muslims, when he pulled out of Paris [the international climate treaty], when he talked about Charlottesville. They were children. Their values don\u2019t align with his values, but there is less toxicity when you bring up his name. So there is this openness that wasn\u2019t there in the last two elections.\u201d\n\nEven as recently as 2020, Della Volpe said, Democrats could target young people with what politicians in the old big-city machines used to call a \u201cblind pull\u201d \u2014 where a party can focus on turning out everyone in a particular neighborhood because such a high percentage of them will reliably vote for them. This year, he said, with young voters, \u201cit\u2019s definitely more complicated. It\u2019s not a blind pull.\u201d\n\nDella Volpe\u2019s observation underscores how Trump\u2019s strength among irregular voters could force Democrats to reconsider their tactics. Much of the voter registration and turnout work aimed at minority and young voters has historically operated through liberal non-profit organizations that target the broad population in those groups on the assumption that most of them will ultimately favor Democrats.\n\nBut this year, some Democratic strategists worry that casting such a wide net could inadvertently mobilize an unusually large number of peripheral voters who favor Trump. That could compel Democrats to switch more of their registration and turnout efforts toward explicitly partisan programs, which can target voters more precisely based on their partisanship, but which are more difficult to raise money for. \u201cYou are hearing more groups struggling because their thesis has been \u2018I take [non-profit] dollars to get, say, all non-White voters\u2019\u201d to register and turnout, said Smith of Civitech.\n\nFor Republicans, the mirror image imperative is finding ways to organize the irregular Black and Latino voters showing openness to Trump. Republicans don\u2019t have much history of courting those voters, and, ironically, any effort to do so may be impeded by the barriers to voting that many Republican-controlled states have erected since 2020. Republicans also face the complication that Trump\u2019s diversion of large amounts of his fundraising toward his legal defense may mean there\u2019s less money available to invest in on-the-ground campaign operations.\n\nThat may not matter much if the combination of Trump\u2019s ubiquitous media presence and discontent with Biden\u2019s record encourages enough irregular voters open to the former president to turn out in November. Based on the results in 2018, 2020 and 2022, Democrats can feel confident that at least as many habitual voters are hostile to Trump as committed to him, particularly in most of the battleground states that will decide the election. The decisive variable for 2024 may be how many people beyond that inner core of the most reliable voters show up and whether they break for the former president as decisively as most polls now suggest.\n\nCLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to clarify the name of the PAC that turned out Latino voters in Nevada in 2022.",

        "text": "AI and the 2024 Elections \u2013 Ash Center\nIn response to these challenges, Allen emphasized the urgency of addressing misinformation and disinformation and advocated for improved incentive structures in the electoral system. She outlined three key steps to protect the capacity to process information during elections: identifying trusted sources early, guarding against deepfakes by presuming media is fictitious, and prioritizing education to build digital competence in the larger population.\n\nAllen emphasized that new technologies have been leading to misinformation for some time. \u201cWe now live in a world where the capacity to generate misinformation and disinformation absolutely swamps the capacity of fact checkers,\u201d she said. This environment will lead to \u201ca lot of stress tests of our electoral systems all across the globe\u201d in the months ahead.\n\n\u201cMany polls have come out recently showing just how high the anxiety is in the general public about the impact of artificial intelligence on our elections,\u201d said Danielle Allen during a panel session co-hosted by the GETTING-Plurality Research Network a project of the Ash Center\u2019s Allen Lab for Democracy Renovation at HKS, and Connection Science at MIT Media Lab. Participants discussed how to leverage AI\u2019s potential to bolster democratic engagement and strengthen election integrity while addressing the technology\u2019s adverse effects.\n\nIn 2024, a record number of voters will head to the polls. Elections are scheduled to take place in at least 64 countries, collectively representing approximately 49% of the global population. And this year, there\u2019s a noteworthy new development: emerging AI technologies, which have the potential to impact electoral processes and outcomes in a variety of ways.\n\nPotential to dissuade voters\n\nAllen also noted that much of AI\u2019s potential political power lies in campaign strategies that aim to disincentivize people from voting. In response, she urged instituting universal voting and transitioning from plurality voting to ranked-choice voting. \u201cWe can think really hard about our electoral system and make choices for our electoral system that incentivize positive behavior from candidates.\u201d\n\nThreat to election infrastructure, AI panic\n\nNate Persily, Professor of Law at Stanford Law School and former Senior Research Director of the Presidential Commission on Election Administration, described the increased vulnerability of election infrastructure due to AI and other trends. \u201cThe basic rule for AI and democracy is that it amplifies the abilities of all good and bad actors in the system to achieve all the same goals they\u2019ve always had,\u201d he summarized.\n\nPersily expressed greater concern about public perception in 2024 than AI itself. \u201cAI panic is itself a democracy problem,\u201d he argued, as the actual prevalence of deepfakes is minimal but can be greatly expanded by the media. Therefore, the issue with AI and democracy isn\u2019t just the risk of believing false information but the erosion of trust in authentic content. \u201cBut in the end, look, we\u2019ve got paleolithic emotions, medieval institutions, and God-like technology,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so, this technology that we\u2019ve developed is going to have effects on our democracy. But I think it\u2019s of less significance than the sociological factors that are really causing some problems in both U.S. democracy and around the world.\u201d\n\nBalancing privacy and protection\n\nSandy Pentland, Professor of Media Arts and Sciences at MIT, focused on the foundational role of identity and reputation in mitigating online threats and establishing trust. Both Allen and Pentland referenced Taiwan as a model for balancing privacy while protecting against disinformation and online crime. There, users are anonymous on digital media but verified as actual humans. Pentland noted that even crypto exchanges now require identification, which is then kept confidential.\n\n\u201cAnd so, what we have to do is we have to think about, \u2018Can we do that in media?\u2019\u201d Pentland asked. \u201cAnd the answer is pretty [much] yes. We have most of the infrastructure there already to do it.\u201d He contended that the mechanisms used in Taiwan and in crypto exchanges offer a way to understand whom one interacts with without compromising privacy. \u201cI would suggest that we have this sort of fairly radical principle: a complete anonymity in opposition to the ability to track down bad guys and have some sort of knowledge of who it is that we\u2019re dealing with.\u201d",

Texas Republicans have supported changes to make election records easier to access soon after elections.\n\nVotebeat is a nonprofit news organization reporting on voting access and election administration across the U.S. Sign up for Votebeat Texas\u2019 free newsletter here.\n\nThis story was reported in partnership with The Texas Tribune, a member-supported, nonpartisan newsroom informing and engaging Texans on state politics and policy.\n\nTexas\u2019 efforts to make elections more transparent allows the public \u2014 in limited instances \u2014 to pierce the anonymity of the ballot and find out how people voted, undermining the secrecy essential to free elections.\n\nThe choices voters make in the private voting booth can later be identified in some cases using public, legally available records, a review by Votebeat and The Texas Tribune found.\n\nSince 2020, requests for such records have skyrocketed, fueled by unsubstantiated concerns about widespread voter fraud, and Texas lawmakers have supported changes to make election records easier to access soon after elections.\n\nCounty elections administrators, trying to fulfill activists\u2019 demands for transparency, have also made information public that can make it easier to determine how specific people voted.\n\nAn effort to link a voter to specific ballot choices is more likely to succeed in circumstances involving less populous counties, small precincts, and low-turnout elections.\n\n\u201cWhat bothers me is that people cannot vote in secret in the United States,\u201d said Williamson County District Attorney Shawn Dick about the potential lapses in ballot secrecy. \u201cIf people\u2019s ballots don\u2019t remain anonymous, that\u2019s a huge affront to our system of government and our system of elections.\u201d\n\nSeveral election officials said there have been concerns and ongoing discussions about the possibility of people exploiting public records and data to detect or narrow down how individuals voted, particularly in smaller counties.\n\nRelated Top Texas election official acknowledges concerns about threats to ballot secrecy\n\nAnd the Texas Secretary of State\u2019s office has been aware that publicly available information could be used to link a particular ballot to the voter who cast it, according to sources who spoke to Votebeat and the Tribune on the condition of anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to speak publicly on the issue. Nonetheless, state lawmakers have spent the last several years making it easier to mine voter and ballot data.\n\nVotebeat and the Tribune were able to verify and replicate a series of steps to identify a specific person\u2019s ballot choices using public records. But to protect the secrecy of the ballot, the two news outlets are not detailing the precise information needed or the process used to match ballot images with individual voters.\n\nElection administration experts and voter advocates say Texas lawmakers need to find a better balance between transparency and voters\u2019 ballot privacy \u2014 and clarify the roles county elections administrators and the Secretary of State\u2019s office play in getting there.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t share this information, we\u2019re not able to determine whether or not the ballot is secure,\u201d said Bob Stein, a political science professor at Rice University and an election administration expert. \u201cOn the other hand, if people think that these are things that shouldn\u2019t be shared, then their confidence goes down.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, the independent news site Current Revolt published what it said was the image of the ballot that former Republican Party of Texas Chair Matt Rinaldi cast in the March 5 GOP primary, provided by a source it did not name.\n\nThe site did not explain in detail how its source was able to find the ballot and connect it to Rinaldi.\n\nState and county elections offices maintain an array of election records that are available via open records requests and even published online in some instances. That includes which candidates won individual precincts, where and by which method people voted, the original ballots they cast, and electronic images of those ballots. To be clear, voted ballots do not contain a voter\u2019s name or identifying information such as identification numbers or Social Security numbers. Many kinds of identifying information must also be redacted from other election records before they are released.\n\nBut in certain circumstances, finding someone\u2019s ballot is possible by identifying and cross-referencing a series of variables that are public.\n\nThere was no personally identifying information printed on the ballot Current Revolt claimed was Rinaldi\u2019s, so it\u2019s impossible to say with 100% certainty that it was his. Rinaldi has neither confirmed nor denied that it was his ballot.\n\nRinaldi did not respond to requests for comment from Votebeat and the Tribune. The Republican Party of Texas referred Votebeat and the Tribune to a statement it released on social media saying that the party\u2019s legal counsel advised Rinaldi not to comment and that it was \u201cinvestigating potential civil and criminal acts including defamation\u201d against Current Revolt.\n\nThe state\u2019s chief elections officer is Secretary of State Jane Nelson, who is appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Senate. Her agency declined to comment on whether officials there knew about the vulnerability in ballot secrecy. In a public statement last week, Nelson\u2019s office said county elections administrators need to balance ballot secrecy with election transparency \u2014 but the statement provided them no guidance on how to do that.\n\nOn Tuesday, after Votebeat and the Tribune told her office about vulnerabilities with ballot secrecy, Nelson said in an emailed statement that she was advising county elections administrators that \u201cthey have a duty to redact personally identifiable information\u201d but did not detail what that includes or what information may be redacted.\n\n\u201cNo one should have their ballot privacy compromised,\u201d Nelson said.\n\nTexas election records are an open book\n\nTexas stands out among other states for its expansive approach to making election records public, an effort to provide transparency in a state where unsupported theories about election fraud are widespread.\n\nThe public can obtain data from electronic poll books used at individual voting precincts, showing which voters have cast ballots and detailing exactly when they did so; \u201ccast vote records,\u201d the electronic representation of how voters voted; and ballot images, which are copies of actual ballots as marked by voters.\n\nBy law, counties are supposed to redact identifiable information such as Social Security numbers, state identification numbers, birthdates, or phone numbers. In the case of ballots, they are also supposed to react names.\n\nThe push for increased transparency gained momentum after the 2020 presidential election when former President Donald Trump launched a campaign, bolstered by two fellow Republicans, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, to convince voters the 2020 election was stolen from him.\n\nConservative activists searching for proof of voter fraud routinely began requesting original voted ballots and cast-vote records in almost every Texas county.\n\nAt the time, voted ballots, by law, had to be kept secure and were not available for 22 months after an election. But in August 2022, Paxton \u2014 who had tried unsuccessfully to overturn the 2020 presidential election results in four battleground states outside his jurisdiction \u2014 released a non-binding legal opinion advising county officials to release voted ballots as soon as they are counted, while redacting any information that could identify the voter.\n\nAfter at least three counties challenged Paxton\u2019s advice in court, the Texas Legislature rewrote the law.\n\nDuring the 2023 legislative session, lawmakers overwhelmingly passed House Bill 5180, allowing public access to ballot images, cast-vote records, and the original voted ballot just 61 days after election day.\n\n\u201cThis is about giving our citizens confidence in their elections while protecting our election administrators,\u201d the bill\u2019s author, state Rep. Terry M. Wilson, R-Marble Falls, said during a committee hearing on the legislation in April 2023.\n\nSupporters argued this bill was necessary for third-party groups to conduct audits of elections in a timely manner.\n\nChristina Adkins, then acting director of the Secretary of State\u2019s elections division, told lawmakers during the hearing that the bill provided much needed clarity for the state agency.\n\nBut opponents of the legislation noted that election departments in Texas and across the country had seen an increase since the 2020 presidential election in records requests seeking more technical information about an election.\n\nHow Texas safeguards elections \u2014 and what still poses a threat Get the latest reporting on voting technology, misinformation, the push for hand-counting ballots, and more in Votebeat Texas' free newsletter, delivered twice a month.

A spokesperson for Paxton\u2019s office did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nA ballot Dick previously cast in a Texas election was apparently included as evidence in an unrelated lawsuit filed earlier this year, also accusing Texas of ballot security vulnerabilities.\n\nThat lawsuit alleges that Nelson and election officials from three Central Texas counties violated voters\u2019 equal protection rights by allowing the public to track down a voter\u2019s ballot through a unique identification number. The plaintiffs did not describe the method in the lawsuit and declined to share it with Votebeat and the Tribune. It could not be verified.\n\nThe plaintiffs in the lawsuit, including Laura Pressley, have made similar allegations in past lawsuits that courts have dismissed. Since at least 2014, when she lost a race for the Austin City Council, Pressley has frequently sued counties, election administrators, and the Texas Secretary of State for not following the Texas Election Code as she interprets it. She rarely succeeds in court.\n\nShe and her allies have long pushed for the state to get rid of the popular countywide polling place program \u2014 used by more than 90 jurisdictions in the state. The Texas Senate State Affairs Committee is set to hear testimony on election issues, including the use of the program on Wednesday in Austin.\n\nPressley has also advocated for counties to stop using electronic voting equipment and has demanded the use of sequentially numbered, preprinted ballots, which experts say could further threaten ballot privacy.\n\nIf businesses or politicians are able to track down how individuals voted, Dick said, it would change the way those entities target voters for profit and campaign purposes \u2014 and could open the door to voter intimidation.\n\nDick said the issue needs to be resolved immediately but he doesn\u2019t believe the answer is to shut down public access to ballot records and voting information.\n\nOther states, too, have grappled with whether and when to make cast vote records and ballot images public.\n\nIn South Carolina, a judge earlier this month shot down a group\u2019s request to examine voters\u2019 cast vote records from the 2020 presidential election. The judge determined that if the documents become public under the Freedom of Information Act, it would violate voters\u2019 right to a secret ballot in the state.\n\nIn North Carolina, the State Board of Elections recently removed the precinct-level details of election results for each county from its website. The state argued that because of the particularly low turnout in the state\u2019s recent primary, it could be too easy to determine how some people voted.\n\nIn Texas, some county elections administrators say the Legislature needs to craft a law that settles what information must be made public so elections administration is transparent \u2014 as well as what can be withheld, so ballot secrecy is protected. Without that, they say, vulnerabilities will persist.\n\nIn addition, there are other steps lawmakers could take that would make it harder to breach voters\u2019 privacy, said Jennifer Doinoff, Hays County elections administrator and the president of the Texas Association of Elections Administrators.\n\nFor example, she said, they could change the law to raise the minimum number of voters allowed in a precinct, which would make it more difficult to link a ballot to a specific voter. Lawmakers could also rethink how to release information about voters in small precincts, or not release specific polling location records, she said.\n\nAs things stand now, Doinoff said, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a lot of attorney general opinions, and it\u2019s going to be a lot of working with the state legislators to figure out what is releasable and what\u2019s not.\u201d\n\nData journalist Thomas Wilburn contributed to this story.\n\nNatalia Contreras covers election administration and voting access for Votebeat in partnership with the Texas Tribune.

        "text": "American Airlines faces a discrimination suit after removing 8 Black men from flight\nAmerican Airlines faces a discrimination suit after removing 8 Black men from flight\n\ntoggle caption Kiichiro Sato/AP\n\nThree Black men have filed a lawsuit against American Airlines alleging they were victims of \u201cblatant and egregious racial discrimination\u201d after being removed from a flight.\n\nIn a lawsuit filed in federal court Wednesday, the three plaintiffs \u2014 Alvin Jackson, Emmanuel Jean Joseph and Xavier Veal \u2014 say that they and five other Black male passengers were removed from an American Airlines flight from Phoenix to New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy International Airport in January \u201cwithout any valid reason, based solely on their race.\u201d\n\nThe eight men did not know each other and were not seated together on the flight.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, an American Airlines representative approached each of the eight men and told them to leave the plane and return to the gate in order to be rebooked.\n\n\u201cIn fact, once they reached the jet bridge, they saw that several other Black men were also being removed from the plane. In fact, it appeared to Plaintiffs that American had ordered all of the Black male passengers on Flight 832 off the plane,\u201d the lawsuit says.\n\nOnce all eight men were off the plane, they eventually discovered the reason behind their removal \u2014 an employee told the men someone on the plane complained about body odor. Jackson, Joseph and Veal say they were not told they had body odor, according to the lawsuit.\n\nWhen the three men pointed out that they were being treated unfairly due to their race, an American Airlines staff member said she \u201cdid not disagree,\u201d the lawsuit says.\n\nAll eight men were eventually allowed back on the plane nearly an hour after the airline determined there were no available flights going to JFK airport that evening.\n\n\u201cPlaintiffs then had to reboard the plane and endure the stares of the largely white passengers who viewed them as the cause of the substantial delay. They suffered during the entire flight home, and the entire incident was traumatic, upsetting, scary, humiliating, and degrading,\u201d the lawsuit reads.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIn a statement to NPR, American Airlines said it takes all claims of discrimination \"very seriously\" and wants customers to have a \"positive experience\" when they fly with it.\n\n\"Our teams are currently investigating the matter, as the claims do not reflect our core values or our purpose of caring for people,\" the airline said.\n\nJackson, Joseph, and Veal say what happened to them was \"wrong,\" and they say their experience flying with the airline left them embarrassed and humiliated.\n\n\u201cImagine a flight attendant ordering every white person off a plane because of a complaint about one white person. That would never happen. But that is what happened to us,\" the three men said. \"There is no explanation other than the color of our skin ... clearly, this was discrimination.\"\n\nThe lawsuit is the latest in a string of recent incidents in which the airline has faced allegations of racial discrimination.\n\nIn February, a Chicago woman says she was discriminated against after a flight attendant allegedly confronted her after she used the plane\u2019s first-class restroom.\n\nPamela Hill-Veal, who is Black, says that while she and her family were flying first class on Feb. 10 from Chicago to Phoenix, one of the American Airlines flight attendants stopped her as she returned to her seat \u2014 and accused her of slamming the restroom door.\n\n\"The flight attendant stopped me as I was returning to my seat and told me I 'slammed the restroom door and I was not to do it again since passengers were sleeping on the plane,'\" Hill-Veal said in an interview with NPR. She said she never slammed the door.\n\nIn a statement to NPR, American Airlines said it had been in contact with Hill-Veal to learn more about her experience.\n\n\"We strive to ensure that every customer has a positive travel experience, and we take all claims of discrimination very seriously,\" the airline said.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nWhen asked whether it was considering changes in training or policy for its staff, the airline did not respond.\n\nIn 2023, the company drew criticism after two separate incidents \u2014 one involving track star Sha'Carri Richardson and another involving musician David Ryan Harris \u2014 made headlines.\n\nRichardson was forced off her American flight following an argument with a flight attendant. Richardson said the flight attendant was harassing her and trying to intimidate her, Axios reported.\n\nIn a statement to Axios, the airline said it investigates all claims of discrimination, adding, \"American Airlines strives to provide a positive and welcoming experience to everyone who travels with us, and we take allegations of discrimination very seriously.\"\n\nAnd, in September of that year, Harris, who was traveling with his two biracial children, says he was stopped and questioned at Los Angeles International Airport after an American Airlines flight attendant suspected he was trafficking the children.\n\nAfter the incident, Harris posted a statement that he says was given to him by American: \"We and our flight attendant realized that our policies regarding suspected human trafficking were not followed, and through coaching and counseling ... our flight attendant realizes that their interaction and observations did NOT meet the criteria that human trafficking was taking place.\n\nConcerns about discrimination have followed American for several years. In 2017, the NAACP, the nation's oldest civil rights organization, issued an advisory warning Black travelers to be cautious about flying on American Airlines.\n\nThe airline's chairman responded by saying the company does not \"and will not tolerate discrimination of any kind,\" and the advisory was lifted the next year.\n\nDerrick Johnson, president and CEO of the NAACP, told NPR that the details in the latest lawsuit filed are \u201cdisturbing.\u201d He encourages the Black community to continue to \u201cstand up and speak out\u201d against discrimination.\n\n\"Let\u2019s be clear - traveling while Black should not be characterized by humiliation and disparate interruptions. While we recognize a brand\u2019s ability to evolve beyond mistakes of the past, part of that evolution includes continued accountability for any deviation from core values,\" Johnson said.\n\n",

        "text": "Trust in Media 2024: Which news sources Americans trust \u2014 and which they think lean left or right\nThe American news landscape is fractured and polarized, with no outlet singularly gaining the public's attention or trust. Party identification, and to some extent age, divide American media consumption. Most adults say that at least half their news consumption is politics-related, and most major news sources are perceived by Americans as either left- or right-leaning. Democrats are far more likely than Republicans to trust the news in general, as well as to trust most specific outlets. Republicans \u2014 and Americans in general \u2014 are more likely to classify news sources as liberal than as conservative, though there are exceptions. Democrats and Republicans find some common ground when it comes to sources for financial news, but hold vastly different opinions on other news sources, including the two used most often: CNN and Fox News. In our latest poll, we ask Americans about each of 52 news sources, including their use of each in the past month, its trustworthiness, and its ideological lean. In doing so, we revisit questions asked on a similar survey conducted roughly a year ago, in April 2023, with a handful of additions and removals. The results reflect American views on the media and specific news sources \u2014 including opinions of many people who haven't recently gotten news from the outlets. Some news organizations are used more heavily or elicit opinions from more Americans, and these outlets tend to sit at the top and bottom of these charts. The most and least trusted news sources Like in last year's survey, we asked Americans in 2024 whether they find each of more than 50 outlets very trustworthy, trustworthy, untrustworthy, very untrustworthy, or neither trustworthy nor untrustworthy. Using these results, we calculate each outlet's net trust score \u2014 that is, how much more likely Americans are to say the source is trustworthy or very trustworthy than untrustworthy or very untrustworthy. By this measure, The Weather Channel persists as the most trusted news source, as it was in 2022 and 2023: Americans are 43 percentage points more likely to call The Weather Channel trustworthy as they are to call it untrustworthy. The Weather Channel is followed by two public broadcasters: the BBC (+25) and PBS (+22). The Wall Street Journal (+22) ties with PBS for third place, and is the only organization that publishes a newspaper to rank within the top 10 most trusted outlets. By far, the least-trusted outlet included in the poll is the National Enquirer (-44). The outlets trusted least besides the Enquirer are Infowars (-18) and Breitbart News (-13).\n\nThe same five outlets rank as the top five most trusted this year as did last year, in 2023 \u2014 with the BBC moving just ahead of PBS this time. Net trust in most outlets declined slightly this year, after a move in the opposite direction last year from 2022. Overall, trust in outlets polled all three years has changed little \u2014 as has their relative positions for trust. Democrats are far more likely than Republicans to say they trust the news in general, and the same is true for trust in specific news outlets. For 81% of the 52 news sources asked about, a greater share of Democrats trust than distrust them. That's true for just 25% of sources among Republicans. While both Democrats and Republicans generally are more likely to trust certain television networks over print or online outlets, they differ on which networks they place their trust in. Democrats have the most trust in PBS, ABC, CBS, NBC, and CNN, while Republicans particularly trust Fox News, Fox Business Channel, and Newsmax. There is little overlap in the sources that Democrats and Republicans find most trustworthy \u2014 other than The Weather Channel, which is trusted on both sides of the aisle. Just 13% of news outlets are more likely to be trusted than distrusted by members of both parties, and those that are somewhat bipartisan are focused \u2014 at least in name \u2014 on the economy or financial news. These include Business Insider, the Financial Times, Forbes, the Economist, and the Wall Street Journal. There is even less partisan overlap when it comes to the specific news outlets Americans distrust. Only three are deemed more untrustworthy than trustworthy by both Democrats and Republicans: the National Enquirer, Infowars, and the Daily Caller. CNN is the most politically polarizing, with a 96-point difference in net trust between Democrats and Republicans. Other networks that are trusted far more for news by Democrats than by Republicans include MSNBC (82-point difference), NBC (81 points), CBS (78 points), and ABC (76 points). Republicans, on the other hand, have a net trust that is 62 points higher than Democrats' for Fox News, and 51 points higher for Fox Business Channel.\n\nPeople who have recently used each outlet for news are more likely than Americans overall to deem it trustworthy. Among the outlets for which this gap is largest are Al Jazeera (+71 net trust among recent users vs. -11 for Americans overall), Fox Business Channel (+72 vs. -2), OAN (+70 vs. -7), and Comedy Central (+55 vs. -12). These differences could have several causes, including that people tend not to use news they don't trust, that users are more inclined to say they trust the sources they already use, or that users have more familiarity with sources' trustworthiness.\n\nDespite many Americans saying they consume news from social media, more believe it is untrustworthy than trustworthy, though YouTube and Linkedin are regarded slightly better than others. The least trusted social media platforms are TikTok, Facebook, and Snapchat. Truth Social \u2014 Donald Trump's platform \u2014 is the most polarizing, with Republicans being far more likely to trust it than Democrats. Among Republicans, Truth Social is the most trusted platform, but among Democrats, it is the least trusted. Democrats are more likely than Republicans to trust most other social media platforms, with the exception of X (previously Twitter). This marks a shift from last year's survey, which found greater trust in Twitter among Democrats than Republicans. In the past year, Democrats' trust in news from Truth Social and TikTok also has fallen.\n\nAmericans are divided by age over their trust in news from social media far more than over their trust in other sources of news. Adults under 45 are more trusting of news on social media platforms than older adults are \u2014 especially news from Instagram.\n\nThe most liberal and conservative news sources Coming in a presidential-election year with greater supply and demand of political news, this survey included a series of questions about the ideological lean of each news source \u2014 that is, whether the outlet generally is liberal, moderate, conservative, or non-political. We determine a source's net-ideology score based on the difference between the share of Americans who say it is liberal and the share who say it is conservative. Three times as many outlets are classified as liberal than are classified as conservative. The sources most likely to be viewed as liberal are MSNBC, Comedy Central, and CNN. Major print news outlets \u2014 including the Los Angeles Times, the New York Times, and the Washington Post \u2014 also are significantly more likely to be characterized as liberal than as conservative (though still only around one-third of Americans or fewer overall classify each of them as liberal). Fox News, Fox Business, and Breitbart have the most conservative net-ideology scores, followed by Newsmax and OAN. The sources most likely to be seen as moderate are television networks: CBS, NBC, ABC, and BBC. (All though are more likely to be seen as liberal than as conservative.) No outlet is classified as non-political by the majority of Americans; The Weather Channel has the highest share classifying it as non-political (43%). Just one-quarter say ESPN is non-political, and slightly fewer say People or Comedy Central are.\n\nNearly all news organizations are more likely to be viewed as liberal by Republicans than by Democrats. Most Republicans believe the news in general is liberal, and the same is true for many specific news sources. Democrats, on the other hand, are more likely to characterize the news as moderate, though they do differentiate between individual outlets. Some outlets are viewed as right-leaning by Democrats but as left-leaning by Republicans. These include business-focused outlets Bloomberg, the Wall Street Journal, and Forbes, as well as tabloids the National Enquirer and the New York Post. All of the outlets that Republicans consider conservative-leaning, Democrats do as well \u2014 and to an even greater extent. A handful of outlets are considered to have about the same ideological lean by both Democrats and Republicans, including Comedy Central, The Weather Channel, and Newsmax.\n\nThe news outlets that Americans consider to be the most conservative are among the least trusted, according to our survey. No outlet considered conservative has a positive net-trust score. However, some sources perceived as liberal-leaning are also broadly distrusted by Americans overall, including Comedy Central and Al Jazeera. Many of the sources with the highest trust ratings are ones that Americans don't perceive as particularly liberal or conservative, though that also applies to the least trusted overall: the National Enquirer.\n\nWhere Americans get their news Eight in 10 Americans have gotten news from at least one of two sources in the past month: television or social media. The popularity of each format of news consumption is split by age: Younger adults are most likely to have used social media for news, while a majority of older people have relied on television. Age also divides other forms of news consumption, with young adults being more likely to have gotten news from video platforms, and older people from print newspapers. Four in 10 Americans say they've heard about news from a friend, family member, or acquaintance. News apps and websites are also common ways to receive news, followed by radio and podcasts. 16% have used print newspapers for news, including 21% of Americans 45 and older and 11% of younger adults.\n\nAmong the 52 outlets polled about, Fox News (34%) and CNN (32%) top the list in terms of the share of Americans who say they've used each as a source for news in the past month. Other major networks also rank highly in usage, including NBC (29%), ABC (29%), and CBS (28%). The New York Times is the most-read print news source, with 24% saying they've used it for news in the last month. Yahoo News is the most likely to have been used among exclusively online news sources: 20% have used it. Each of the 45 other news sources included in the survey were used by fewer than one in five Americans. Republicans' news sources are somewhat more consolidated than Democrats'; 54% of Republicans say they've used Fox News in the past month, while fewer than 25% of Republicans say the same about any other news source. Democrats use a wider variety of outlets in the poll: About half have recently used CNN (48%) and more than 25% have used each of CBS, NBC, ABC, the New York Times, MSNBC, and the Washington Post. Adults under 45 are somewhat more likely than older Americans to say they've gotten news from the New York Times, and less likely to have gotten it from television networks including CBS, ABC, NBC, and Newsmax.\n\nMore Americans say they've gotten news from social media networks Facebook (40%) or YouTube (39%) than from any of the individual news outlets polled. Younger Americans are especially likely to rely on the social media outlets asked about: 50% of adults under 45 say they've used Facebook for news in the past month, compared to just 31% of older adults. One-quarter of Americans (24%) have seen news in the past month on Instagram, 21% on X (previously known as Twitter), 16% on TikTok, and 11% on Reddit. News aggregation sites also are a common way to consume news, though Americans may not be aware of that category name and what it includes.

        "summary": " Donald Trump was found guilty on all counts in his New York hush-money case on Thursday . Polls show some polls show that this conviction will erode Trump's support . But Democrats should not get too excited about these numbers, says Julian Zelizer .",
        "text": "How Trump\u2019s guilty verdict will impact the 2024 presidential election\nScandals have swirled around former President Donald Trump since his first presidential campaign in 2016. But as of Thursday \u2014 having been found guilty on all counts in his New York hush-money case \u2014 he is now officially a convicted felon. Could that fact cut through all the other headlines and be a game-changer for the 2024 election?\n\nAt first glance, there's some evidence from polls that this conviction will meaningfully erode Trump's support. An April survey from CNN/SSRS found that, while 76 percent of Trump supporters said they would support Trump regardless, 24 percent said they \"might reconsider\" their support for him if he was convicted. And a May poll from Emerson College found that 25 percent of voters said a guilty verdict in New York would make them less likely to vote for Trump.\n\nA few pollsters have also asked two versions of the standard \"who will you vote for?\" question in recent weeks: one straightforward one, and one that asked respondents who they would vote for if Trump was convicted in the New York case. On average, Trump went from leading by 1 percentage point in these polls without considering the conviction to trailing by 6 points with it.\n\nBut Democrats would be wise to not get too excited about these numbers. Take another look at the wording of the CNN/SSRS poll: Twenty-four percent of Trump supporters said they \"might reconsider\" their vote. That's not the same as \"will definitely change\" their vote! In light of this conviction, many Trump supporters might simply have a crisis of confidence about their vote without outright switching to President Joe Biden.\n\nThat's basically what another poll from ABC News/Ipsos found. Like CNN/SSRS, they asked Trump supporters what they would do if Trump was convicted in the New York case, but they provided options for both \"reconsider\" and \"no longer support.\" Sixteen percent said they would reconsider supporting Trump, but only 4 percent said they would no longer support him. (Similar to CNN/SSRS, 80 percent said they would continue to support him.)\n\nLikewise, you should always be careful with polls like Emerson's that ask Americans whether something makes them more or less likely to vote a certain way. Respondents often don't take these questions literally; instead, they use them as a proxy for whether they approve or disapprove of the thing being asked about.\n\nIndeed, over three-quarters of those who told Emerson a conviction would make them \"less likely\" to vote for Trump had told the pollster on a different question that they were already voting for Biden. By contrast, only 11 percent of Trump voters said a guilty verdict would make them less likely to vote for him \u2014 so the potential impact on his actual support is much smaller than it initially appears.\n\nOther polls also support the theory that this conviction won't cause mass defections to Biden. Those horse-race polls I cited above? They don't actually show many Trump voters switching their vote to Biden. Instead, most of the support Trump loses goes into the undecided column or to an unnamed, hypothetical \"someone else\":\n\nOn average, Trump loses 6 points of support after a conviction is taken into account \u2014 but Biden gains only 1 point. \"Someone else\" or undecided gains 5 points. That's consistent with the idea that this conviction will make some Trump supporters squeamish about the idea of pulling the lever for him, so they will stop identifying as Trump supporters for a while \u2014 but most of them won't go so far as to vote for Biden.\n\nAnd that, in turn, could indicate that this drop in Trump's support will be short-lived. Sure, Trump supporters who abandon him after this conviction could conceivably abstain from voting or vote for a third-party candidate. But the best predictor of future behavior is past behavior, so there's also a good chance that they will eventually get over their discomfort and return to Trump's side, especially considering there are still five months left until Election Day \u2014 plenty of time for Trump to spin a narrative that helps voters overcome any hangups about voting for a convicted felon.\n\nWe don't need to search far for a precedent for this. In October 2016, Trump's campaign was blindsided by the infamous \"Access Hollywood\" tape, on which Trump bragged about sexually assaulting women. Polls at the time showed that the tape made some Republicans uncomfortable about supporting Trump, and his national support in 538's polling average at the time fell by about 1 point. But Trump's support quickly recovered: Within three weeks of the tape's release, he was polling better than he was before it.\n\nThat said, even if most Trump defectors only switch to undecided and eventually return to the fold, that doesn't mean the conviction will have zero effect on the race. That average 1-point gain for Biden isn't nothing \u2014 in a close race (which 2024 is shaping up to be), it could mean the difference between winning and losing. But it's also important not to overstate the conviction's impact. If the hush-money trial ends up determining the presidential race, it will likely be because the campaign was a game of inches anyway.\n\nIrena Li contributed research.",

Jane Rosenberg via Reuters\n\nIn October 2016, Pecker also flagged to Michael Cohen that adult film actress Stormy Daniels was shopping a story of her 2006 alleged sexual encounter with Trump, though Pecker declined to buy the story himself.\n\nMichael Cohen testified that he brought the story directly to Trump \u2013 speaking with the then-Republican nominee nearly two dozen times in the month ahead of the election \u2013 and ultimately paid for the story out of his own pocket on Trump's orders.\n\nTrump later reimbursed Cohen in 2017 by making a series of $35,000 payments, labeled in business records as legal expenses pursuant to a retainer agreement.\n\nProsecutors alleged that Trump's description of the payments disguised their true purpose so voters would never learn about the hush-money payment, though a 2018 Wall Street Journal report uncovered the payment.\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump and attorney Michael Cohen during a visit to the Pastors Leadership Conference at New Spirit Revival Center, Sept. 21, 2016, in Cleveland. Evan Vucci/AP\n\n\"Of course, we will never know if this effort to hoodwink the American voter made the difference in the 2016 election, but that's not something we have to prove,\" Steinglass said. \"The point is that the reimbursement to Cohen was cloaked in false business records to hide the conspiracy.\"\n\nA long road to indictment\n\nWhen Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III was conducting his investigation into allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 election, his office referred Trump's lawyer Michael Cohen to federal prosecutors in New York's Southern District.\n\nIt remains unclear what exactly prompted the referral, but by April 2018, the FBI had raided Cohen's office, hotel room, and home. In August of that year, Cohen pleaded guilty to skirting campaign rules when he made payments to Daniels and McDougal.\n\nThe plea deal was seen as a major shock as Cohen has dutifully stood by Trump for years through numerous scandals and legal quandaries.\n\nMichael Cohen, the former lawyer to President Donald Trump, exits the Federal Courthouse in New York City, Aug. 21, 2018. Yana Paskova/Getty Images, FILE\n\nTrump himself was referenced in Cohen's indictment as \"Individual-1\" who directed him to make the payments, but federal prosecutors opted to not charge Trump due to a longstanding guidance against indicting sitting presidents.\n\nWhen Trump left office, prosecutors never reopened their investigation or brought charges against the former president. Next door from the federal prosecutors, Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance Jr. \u2013 who had begun investigating Trump's hush money payments in 2018 \u2013 opted to continue the investigation.\n\nBy 2021, Vance authorized his prosecutors to pursue a criminal indictment based on Trump's exaggeration of his net worth. That investigation was ongoing when Vance left office, leaving the decision to his successor Alvin Bragg.\n\nBragg, however, determined that the case \"wasn't ready for takeoff,\" prompting the resignation of two top prosecutors.\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg listens at news conference in New York, Feb. 7, 2023. Seth Wenig/AP\n\nAt the time, the case appeared dead in the water, but Bragg shook up his legal team and found success in the prosecution of the Trump Organization for a 15-year tax fraud scheme and a guilty plea from Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg. By 2023, a new case theory centered on the testimony of Michael Cohen emerged, and prosecutors successfully convinced a grand jury to indict the former president.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump arrives for an arraignment hearing at NYS Supreme Court, April 4, 2023, in New York. Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images\n\nIn April 2023, Trump became the first current or former president to be criminally indicted. He pleaded not guilty to 34 felony charges of falsifying business records stemming from his hush payment to Daniels.\n\nThe New York indictment became the first of four criminal cases against the former president. The other cases relate to his alleged conduct during the 2020 election and how he dealt with classified documents. He has pleaded not guilty in those cases and denies the charges.\n\nTrump's past takes center stage\n\nAfter months of back and forth, including multiple attempts by Trump's attorneys to have the case dismissed or delay the case, the trial began on April 15.\n\nProsecutors called 20 witnesses \u2013 including some of Trump's closest advisors and deputies \u2013 to try to prove their case against the former president.\n\nProsecutors first called Pecker, who went into detail about the catch-and-kill agreement he made with Trump and Cohen during and after the 2016 campaign.\n\nThe former publisher also described how after securing the presidency, Trump kept tabs on the women he and Cohen had paid off.\n\nRhona Graff, Trump's longtime assistant, testified that she recalled seeing Daniels in the reception of the executive floor of Trump Tower.\n\nDaniels would eventually take the stand, coming face to face with the former president for the first time in over a decade, and recounted their alleged sexual encounter, which Trump continues to deny.\n\n\"I told very few people that we had actually had sex because I felt ashamed that I didn't stop it, that I didn't say no,\" Daniels told jurors.\n\nTrump attorney Susan Necheles got into a heated cross-examination with Daniels questioning the validity of her claims and arguing she was making it up to extort money from Trump.\n\n\"You have a lot of experience of making phony stories about sex appear to be real?\" Necheles asked.\n\nStormy Daniels is questioned by prosecutor Susan Hoffinger before Justice Juan Merchan during former President Donald Trump's criminal trial in Manhattan state court in New York City, May 7, 2024 in this courtroom sketch. Jane Rosenberg via Reuters\n\n\"The sex in the films is very real, just like what happened to me in that room,\" she said on the stand.\n\nThings got even more heated when prosecutors concluded their their case by calling Cohen himself.\n\nCohen contended that Trump ordered him to \"just do it,\" referring to the payoff during the end of the campaign, as word of the alleged affair with Daniels would have been \"catastrophic.\"\n\n\"He stated to me that he had spoken to some friends, some individuals, very smart people. It's $130,000. Just pay it,\" Cohen testified.\n\nDefense attorney Todd Blanche launched an attack on Cohen's credibility noting his previous perjury convictions and lies to the press.\n\nThis courtroom sketch depicts Michael Cohen being examined by defense lawyer Todd Blanche during former U.S. President Donald Trump's criminal trial in Manhattan state court, May 20, 2024, in New York. Jane Rosenberg/Reuters\n\nSpecifically, he accused Cohen of lying about a phone call he said he had with Donald Trump on Oct. 24, 2016, showing phone records that indicated Cohen called Trump's bodyguard.\n\nDefense lawyers presented evidence that Cohen actually made the call to complain to Trump's bodyguard about a teenage prank caller.\n\nCohen, who remained calm during his time on the stand, stood by his testimony and said the bodyguard gave the phone to Trump.\n\nTrump chose not to take the stand in his own defense, however, he was very vocal as the trial unfolded.\n\nDrama inside and outside the court\n\nEver since the indictment was handed down to him, Trump repeatedly lashed out against key players in the case \u2013 including Cohen, Daniels, Bragg and Judge Juan Merchan, the judge presiding over the case \u2013 to the press during rallies and on social media.\n\nTrump's frequent attacks ultimately prompted the Merchan to issue a limited gag order prohibiting Trump from making public comments about the witnesses, jury, and family of Bragg or Merchan.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump's defense lawyer Emil Bove attends a charge hearing with prosecutor Matthew Colangelo before Justice Juan Merchan, during Trump's criminal trial in Manhattan state court in New York, on May 21, 2024. in this courtroom sketch.

Tommy Tuberville and former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy.\n\nJohnson said in a statement after the verdict that it was a \"shameful day in American history.\"\n\n\"This was a purely political exercise, not a legal one,\" he said in a statement. \"President Trump will rightfully appeal this absurd verdict\u2014and he WILL WIN!\"\n\nThe fundraising page for Trump's campaign went down for a few minutes after it was made public following the verdict. The campaign is claiming the platform was shut down \"due to overwhelming amount of support.\"\n\nTrump attended a campaign fundraiser hours after the verdict. \"He was fired up,\" a person exiting the fundraiser told ABC News.\n\nAnother insider told ABC News the mood of the fundraiser was \"very upbeat.\"\n\nWhat's next\n\nThis is not the end of Trump's legal challenges.\n\nThe former president was indicted twice by Special Counsel Jack Smith on federal charges related to Trump's his alleged interference with the 2020 election and alleged keeping of classified government documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate.\n\nTrump is also facing state charges in Fulton County, Georgia, over his alleged interference with the 2020 election.\n\nThe former president has pleaded not guilty to those charges and denied all wrongdoing.\n\nABC News' Aaron Katersky, Rachel Scott, Kelsey Walsh and John Santucci contributed to this report.",

        "text": "Trump could still vote for himself after New York conviction if he\u2019s not in prison on Election Day\nDENVER (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump may be convicted of a felony and reside in Florida, a state notorious for restricting the voting rights of people with felony convictions. But he can still vote as long as he stays out of prison in New York state.\n\nThat\u2019s because Florida defers to other states\u2019 disenfranchisement rules for residents convicted of out-of-state felonies. In Trump\u2019s case, New York law only removes the right to vote for people convicted of felonies when they\u2019re incarcerated. Once they\u2019re out of prison, their rights are automatically restored, even if they\u2019re on parole, per a 2021 law passed by the state\u2019s Democratic legislature.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s conviction on 34 felony counts marks the end of his historic hush money trial. But the fight is far from over. Here\u2019s what to know.\n\nHow did Trump respond? Trump falsely blasted a \u2018rigged trial\u2019 and attacked star witness in a speech on Friday. Follow the AP\u2019s live coverage\n\nTrump falsely blasted a \u2018rigged trial\u2019 and attacked star witness in a speech on Friday. When is the sentencing? July 11, just days before Republicans\n\nJuly 11, just days before Can Trump vote? He may be convicted and reside in Florida, but can still vote\n\nHe may be convicted and reside in Florida, but Will this impact the election? It\u2019s unclear whether Trump\u2019s once-imaginable status as a person convicted of a felony will have any impact at all on voters.\n\n\u201cIf a Floridian\u2019s voting rights are restored in the state of conviction, they are restored under Florida law,\u201d Blair Bowie of the Campaign Legal Center wrote in a post, noting that people without Trump\u2019s legal resources are often confused by Florida\u2019s complex rules.\n\nSo as long as Trump isn\u2019t sent to prison, he can vote for himself in Florida in November\u2019s election.\n\n\u201cHis rights depend on his sentencing,\u201d wrote Michael McDonald, a University of Florida political scientist who\u2019s tracked his state\u2019s felony disenfranchisement rules, on the social media site X, formerly Twitter.\n\nWhat to know about Trump\u2019s second term:\n\nStaffing the administration: Here are the people Trump has picked recess appointments Follow all of our coverage as Donald Trump assembles his second administration.\n\nTrump was convicted Thursday of falsifying business records in a scheme to illegally influence the 2016 election through hush money payments to a porn actor who said the two had sex.\n\nA lifelong New Yorker, Trump established residency in Florida in 2019, while he was in the White House.\n\nEven if he is elected president again, Trump will not be able to pardon himself of state charges in New York. The president\u2019s pardon power applies only to federal crimes.\n\nThe conviction, and even imprisonment, would not bar Trump from continuing his pursuit of the White House. The Republican National Convention, which will open four days after his July 11 sentencing date in New York, adopted rules last year that didn\u2019t include any specific provisions if its presumptive nominee is convicted of a crime.\n\nDelegates could move to change their rules before formalizing Trump\u2019s nomination, but there\u2019s no evidence that a significant faction of the party would try to replace the former president on the GOP ticket. Trump commands loyalty across the GOP base, and the Republican National Committee is run by his loyalists, including his daughter-in-law Lara Trump as co-chair.",

        "text": "Measuring the Swing: Evaluating the Key Voters of 2024\nMethodology: A New Approach to Identifying Swing Voters\n\nThe 2024 presidential election is unique in several ways. For one, it is a rematch of the 2020 election, the first presidential rematch of its kind since 1956, and this time it's between a current and former president. The two leading candidates have nearly universal name recognition, but they are also both relatively unpopular with voters, and there are also several third-party candidates running who are capturing a higher portion of the vote than they did in the previous election cycle.\n\nGiven this dynamic, there are various types of swing voters in the 2024 election: Biden 2020 and Trump 2020 voters who are now considering voting third-party or for the other major party\u2019s candidate, voters who say they\u2019re undecided about whom they\u2019ll vote for, and new or first-time voters who are weighing multiple options, among others. Our scoring method captures various types of swing voters by identifying respondents who show a consistent swing pattern across multiple indicators.\n\nIn recent years, analysts have used various methodologies to identify swing voters, including vote-switchers (Biden-to-Trump or Trump-to-Biden), undecided voters, and those who report similar favorability ratings toward the major candidates.\n\nEach of these indicators is useful, but they all have limitations when solely relied on to determine the swing voters of the 2024 election. Below, we discuss how each of these indicators can exclude voters who should be classified as swing voters (false negatives), and may include voters who are actually set on their vote choice (false positives).\n\nLooking exclusively at those who switch their vote from Biden in 2020 to Trump in 2024 (or vice versa), without also considering other swing indicators, is limiting. This methodology does not include Biden or Trump voters who are now choosing a third-party candidate, Biden or Trump voters who say they are undecided this time around, or new or first-time voters. This methodology also includes vote-switchers who are not necessarily persuadable swing voters, such as voters who say they picked Biden or Trump in 2020 but say they are \u201cdefinitely\u201d voting for the opposite candidate this year.\n\nLooking exclusively at voters who say they are \u201cundecided\u201d about whom they will vote for is also limiting because it does not account for voters who currently lean toward one candidate or the other, but could still change their minds.\n\nAdditionally, \u201cdouble haters\u201d \u2014 voters who say they are unfavorable of both Biden and Trump \u2014 are not fully representative of swing voters on their own. Voters across party lines have expressed dissatisfaction with both major candidates, and about 1 in 3 voters indicate that their vote this year is driven by opposition to the other candidate, rather than approval of the candidate they support. As a result, many voters may be unfavorable of Biden or Trump but are still certain they will vote for them.\n\nTo address the limitations and gaps in these individual metrics, we found that looking at a respondent\u2019s cumulative pattern of responses was most effective at identifying various types of swing voters for the 2024 presidential election.\n\nOur Scoring Method\n\nFrom April 19 to May 4, 2024, Data for Progress conducted 4,923 respondent interviews of U.S. likely voters nationally using web panel respondents pooled over four surveys. The sample was weighted to be representative of likely voters by age, gender, education, race, geography, and voting history. The surveys were conducted in English.\n\nIn our surveys, we asked respondents various questions to create our scoring method. These include:\n\nWhom a respondent voted for in the 2020 presidential election;\n\nWhom a respondent would vote for in a two-way 2024 race between Biden and Trump;\n\nWhom a respondent would vote for in a six-way 2024 race between Biden, Trump, Libertarian candidate Chase Oliver, Green Party candidate Jill Stein, and Independents Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Cornel West;\n\nWhom a respondent would vote for in a generic congressional race between an unnamed Democrat and Republican;\n\nA respondent\u2019s levels of favorability for Biden and Trump on a five-point scale;\n\nA respondent\u2019s level of approval for Biden\u2019s job performance on a five-point scale; and\n\nWhether a respondent says they are considering Biden, Trump, a third-party candidate, and/or not voting in 2024.\n\nIf a respondent meets three of the four indicators below, they are considered a swing voter. (We found that requiring all four indicators to be met was overly restrictive, capturing too few respondents, while requiring just two of the four to be met was overly inclusive, capturing too many).\n\nTheir vote choices between 2020 vote recall, the 2024 two-way ballot, and the 2024 six-way ballot are not consistent. Their vote choices between the 2024 two-way ballot, the 2024 six-way ballot, and generic congressional ballot are not all consistent. They report similar ratings for Biden favorability and Trump favorability, or for Biden job approval and Trump favorability. They say they are considering at least two options in 2024 (Biden, Trump, third-party, not voting).\n\nAs additional controls, we also exclude all voters who say they are \"definitely\" voting for a certain candidate on the six-way ballot, along with voters who say they will \u201cdefinitely not vote\u201d at all in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nWhen applied to four pooled surveys from April 19 to May 4, 2024, this methodology produces a sample of 690 likely voters (14% of the total likely voter sample).",

But the former president spoke to reporters outside the courtroom, calling the trial a \"rigged, disgraceful trial\" and saying that the \"real verdict\" will be rendered on Election Day.\n\nTrump's legal team signaled it would appeal the conviction.\n\nNew York Judge Juan Merchan set sentencing for July 11 \u2014 just four days before the start of the Republican National Convention. Trump faces a maximum sentence of four years in prison, but as a first-time, white-collar offender, no prison time is necessary, and he could receive probation instead.\n\nLoading...\n\nThe jury heard from 22 witnesses during about four weeks of testimony in Manhattan\u2019s criminal court. Jurors also weighed other evidence \u2014 mostly documents like phone records, invoices and checks to Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s once loyal \u201cfixer,\u201d who paid Daniels to keep her story of an alleged affair with the former president quiet.\n\nThe facts of the payments and invoices labeled as legal services were not in dispute. What prosecutors needed to prove was that Trump falsified the records in order to further another crime \u2014 in this case, violating the New York election law that makes it a crime for \u201cany two or more persons [to] conspire to promote or prevent the election of any person to a public office by unlawful means.\u201d The jurors were able to choose whether those unlawful means were violating the Federal Election Campaign Act, falsifying tax returns or falsifying other business records.\n\nTrump\u2019s defense focused intently on the credibility of Cohen and argued that influencing an election is not illegal.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe verdict came more than a year after a grand jury indicted Trump on March 30, 2023, marking the first time a former or sitting president faced criminal charges.\n\nRepublicans dismissed the indictment as an overreach of power by Democratic District Attorney Alvin Bragg, who had brought the charges. On Thursday, following the conviction, Republican elected officials quickly rallied around Trump again.\n\nAt a news conference Thursday evening, Bragg said: \"While this defendant may be unlike any other in American history, we arrived at this trial \u2014 and ultimately today at this verdict \u2014 in the same manner as every other case that comes through the courtroom doors: by following the facts and the law, and doing so without fear or favor.\"\n\n\n\nWhat the jury heard\n\nIn August 2015, two months after Trump announced his 2016 presidential bid, David Pecker, then the publisher of the National Enquirer tabloid, met with Trump and Cohen at Trump Tower, according to testimony from Pecker and Cohen.\n\nAt that meeting, Pecker testified, it was agreed that he would be the \u201ceyes and ears\u201d of the Trump campaign. His job was to look out for negative stories from women that he could \u201ctake off the marketplace\u201d by buying up the rights to the stories but never publishing them.\n\nThe plan, as Pecker outlined it, was that he would suppress these stories and at the same time publish negative stories about Trump\u2019s opponents. Some of these stories, Pecker said, were sent to Trump and Cohen for approval prior to publication.\n\nOver the next year, Pecker said, he carried out this role. His testimony was corroborated by Keith Davidson, an attorney who represented both Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal. In about June 2016, McDougal considered going public with her story of a yearlong affair with Trump. But Pecker bought the rights to that story, with the expectation that he would be reimbursed by Trump. That never happened.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIn early October 2016, according to the testimony of former Trump communications aide Hope Hicks, the campaign was rocked by the release of the Access Hollywood tape, where Trump could be heard boasting, \u201cWhen you\u2019re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab \u2019em by the p****.\u201d\n\nThe next day, according to Pecker, Cohen and Davidson, Daniels threatened to go public with accusations that she'd had a sexual encounter with Trump in 2006 in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite during a celebrity golf tournament.\n\nIn her testimony, Daniels said there was a \u201cpower imbalance\u201d when, after leaving the suite\u2019s restroom, she found Trump on the hotel bed in his underwear. That\u2019s when, Daniels said, they had sex.\n\nShe testified that Trump had dangled a possible role on his TV show The Celebrity Apprentice. This detail \u2014 that the sex wasn\u2019t entirely wanted \u2014 caused the defense to request a mistrial, which was denied. It also provided a motive for Trump to suppress the story. Prosecutors said, \u201cTrump knew what happened in that hotel room\u201d and didn\u2019t want it to come out. The adult-film actor\u2019s testimony also included intimate details of her alleged sexual encounter, some of which Judge Merchan agreed with the defense were not necessary.\n\nAs October 2016 drew to a close, Cohen testified, he frantically opened bank accounts and tried to come up with a way to pay the $130,000 to keep Daniels quiet. But Trump, Cohen said, wanted to delay the payment until after the election, with the idea that after the election, it wouldn\u2019t matter whether Daniels was paid.\n\nThis point, that Trump was making the payment to influence the election by keeping women voters on board, was corroborated by a number of other witnesses. Hicks testified that Trump, by then in the White House, told her that it was better the story came out in 2018, rather than 2016.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nCohen ultimately wired the money himself to Daniels, with the understanding, he said, that he would be repaid by Trump. Cohen testified to a number of conversations with Trump, backed up by phone records, including on the day he wired the payments. But the defense rattled Cohen on cross-examination when it presented evidence that one of the calls that Cohen had said was made through Trump\u2019s bodyguard, Keith Schiller, was instead with Schiller about threats from a 14-year-old prankster.\n\nStill, the heart of the case rested on the testimony of what happened after the election, when the records were falsified, in particular the handwritten notes and documents from the Trump Organization\u2019s former comptroller, Jeff McConney.\n\nMcConney authenticated a key record: the bank statement showing Cohen\u2019s wire transfer. That record included handwritten notes from Cohen and Trump\u2019s former chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, describing the $130,000 payment that would be \u201cgrossed up\u201d to cover Cohen\u2019s taxes. That sum, combined with another reimbursement and a bonus, for a total of $420,000, was paid out over 12 months at a rate of $35,000 per month.\n\nThe payments would be described as pursuant to a \u201clegal retainer.\u201d (Weisselberg, who is serving jail time for perjury in Trump\u2019s civil fraud trial, did not testify.)\n\nOn the stand, Cohen described a repayment scheme that formed the basis of the 34 counts of falsified business records: 11 falsified invoices, 12 falsified ledger entries and 11 checks falsely recording the repayment as legal \u201cretainers.\u201d Nine of the checks were signed by Trump himself.\n\nCohen said he and Weisselberg met and discussed the agreement with Trump shortly before he left for Washington, on or about Jan. 17, 2020. Cohen said Trump approved the deal, saying at the end of the meeting that \u201cit was going to be one heck of a ride\u201d in Washington. Cohen said he and Trump discussed the arrangement again, in early February, in the Oval Office. Photos and White House records corroborated that the two met in the Oval Office at the time.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe defense presented just two witnesses, including Robert Costello, an attorney who wanted to represent Cohen after Cohen\u2019s home and office were searched by the FBI in 2018. Costello had been put on the stand to refute Cohen\u2019s claim that Costello was pressuring Cohen to stay on Trump\u2019s \u201cteam.\u201d But Costello\u2019s emails showed that Trump was deciding which of Cohen\u2019s lawyers he wanted to pay and that Costello was concerned about not giving \u201cthe appearance that we are following instructions from [Rudy] Giuliani or the president,\u201d referring to the former New York City mayor who was Trump\u2019s lawyer at the time.\n\nHow this conviction could affect the 2024 election\n\nTrump has continually blasted any criminal charges he faces as \u201celection interference\u201d affecting his 2024 presidential campaign.\n\nThe hush money case likely is the only one of Trump\u2019s four ongoing criminal cases that will be heard ahead of Election Day in November, since federal trials in Washington, D.C., and Florida, as well as a state case in Georgia, are in various stages of delays.\n\nThis decision in New York is likely to have rippling effects as Trump campaigns as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. For now, the other 54 criminal charges he faces have not turned off potential voters, and among some Republicans, the cases have bolstered support for him. However, a conviction may not play well with independent and swing voters.\n\nThe latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll, from May, showed that 17% of voters surveyed said they would be less likely to vote for Trump if he were convicted, while 15% said they would be more likely to vote for him. And 67% of registered voters nationally said it makes no difference to their vote if Trump is found guilty in his hush money trial.\n\nIan Sams, spokesperson for the White House counsel\u2019s office, said in a statement: \"We respect the rule of law, and have no additional comment.\u201d\n\nSponsor Message\n\nPresident Biden's campaign, however, had a longer statement. \u201cIn New York today, we saw that no one is above the law,\" said spokesperson Michael Tyler. \"There is still only one way to keep Donald Trump out of the Oval Office: at the ballot box. Convicted felon or not, Trump will be the Republican nominee for president.\"",

        "text": "#NeverBiden: What\u2019s the campaign against the US approach to Israel about?\nBoth pro-Palestinian critics of the US approach to the war on Gaza and Israel sympathisers are turning against Biden.\n\nIn the run-up to the 2016 United States presidential election, a set of mainstream Republicans worried about the rise of Donald Trump kicked off what came to be known as the \u201cNever Trump\u201d movement.\n\nIn essence, they were making clear that they were so fundamentally opposed to what Trump \u2013 a property baron-turned-TV personality \u2013 stood for, that they would never vote for him.\n\nNow, a new \u201cNever Biden\u201d movement is starting to erupt in the US as the country heads towards the 2024 election, shaped in good measure by President Joe Biden\u2019s response to Israel\u2019s war on Gaza.\n\nOn social media, it has taken the form of a hashtag \u2013 #NeverBiden. But with some donors signalling unhappiness with Biden\u2019s approach to the war on Gaza, this campaign could have real-world implications for the incumbent president\u2019s bid for re-election at a time when he is already trailing former President Trump in key swing states.\n\nSo what\u2019s behind the Never Biden movement? Are there parallels with the Never Trump campaign? And what\u2019s next?\n\nWhat\u2019s behind the Never Biden movement?\n\nThe #NeverBiden movement first emerged in about 2020 from the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, many of them Bernie Sanders supporters who opposed the candidacy of Joe Biden as he emerged as the presumptive nominee.\n\nBut as Biden won the nomination, and Sanders supported him, that campaign largely withered away.\n\nThen came Israel\u2019s war on Gaza \u2013 and Biden\u2019s response to it \u2013 which has drawn criticism from supporters of both Israel and Palestine.\n\nThe revival of the #NeverBiden hashtag was initially prompted by Biden\u2019s threat to suspend military aid to Israel if were to invade Rafah, Gaza\u2019s southernmost town where 1.5 million Palestinians have been sheltering from the war after they were forced out of other parts of the strip by Israel\u2019s relentless bombardment and ground assaults.\n\nHowever, last week, the Biden administration approved $1bn in military aid to Israel, and the United Nations reports roughly 800,000 people have fled Rafah since Israel launched a military operation in the area on May 6. This does not include the $26bn in military aid to Israel that was approved by Congress late last month.\n\nAnd that continued support for Israel has, in turn, drawn criticism from some influential donors who have traditionally backed Biden\u2019s Democratic Party.\n\nDonors, inflation also reasons for \u2018never\u2019 treatment\n\nIn a replay of the 2016 Never Trump slogan, Biden is now also receiving the \u201cnever\u201d treatment, but for a host of different reasons.\n\nThe state of the election in 2 charts: In 2020, there were more #nevertrump voters. In 2024, there are more #neverbiden voters. https://t.co/P7fq29MwU7 pic.twitter.com/9tIUgGWKhy \u2014 Sarah Isgur (@whignewtons) May 19, 2024\n\nMajor Democratic donor and media mogul Haim Saban sent an email to White House aides in early May criticising the Biden administration for halting some weapon shipments to Israel, while stating, \u201cLet\u2019s not forget there are more Jewish voters who care about Israel than Muslim voters who care about Hamas.\u201d\n\nDemocratic mega-donor Haim Saban wrote an email to Biden's aides Steve Ricchetti & Anita Dunn about Biden's decision to put on hold a weapons shipment to Israel: \"Let's not forget there are more Jewish voters who care about Israel than Muslim voters who care about Hamas\" pic.twitter.com/HdeI9iOL3W \u2014 Barak Ravid (@BarakRavid) May 9, 2024\n\nHowever, on the other political side, George Krupp, a major fundraiser for the Democratic Party told the Financial Times last week, \u201cI absolutely think that Biden needs to suspend arms shipments both for humanitarian and political reasons.\u201d\n\nAnd it isn\u2019t just donors, and the effects on Biden\u2019s re-election campaign coffers.\n\nIn a recent New York Times/Siena Poll, Trump was shown to be leading in five key swing states \u2013 Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan, Arizona, and Nevada \u2013 while Biden appeared to be losing support specifically from young and non-white voters.\n\nLast month\u2019s decision by the White House to forgive $7.4bn in student debt has not reversed the dampening of support for Biden among young people on university campuses who are protesting against Israel\u2019s war on Gaza.\n\nAccording to recent polls support for Israel\u2019s military assault dropped from 50 percent in a November Gallup poll to 36 percent in late March.\n\nBeyond the war on Gaza, Biden is also under pressure from voters over his performance on the economy. In a recent personal and household finance poll by Gallup, 41 percent of participants named inflation as their number one financial problem. This is up slightly from 35 percent a year ago and 32 percent in 2022, when the Biden administration signed the Inflation Reduction Act into law, a centrepiece of the president\u2019s legislative achievements. In 2005, only 10 percent cited inflation as their number one concern.\n\nWhat was behind the Never Trump movement?\n\nIn the lead-up to the US presidential election in 2016, which Trump ultimately won narrowly over the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton, many conservative Republicans felt Trump was unsuitable for the presidency due to his unpredictable temperament, lack of political experience and what some saw as his departure from established conservative values.\n\n\u201cI think \u2018Never Trump\u2019 really sort of crystallised for a minority of Republicans, in that while they are Republicans and will always be Republicans, have no doubt about it, they would just never vote for Trump as a person because they thought that his character is just not fit to be president of the United States,\u201d Louis Perron, political strategist and author of Beat the Incumbent: Proven Strategies and Tactics to Win Elections, told Al Jazeera.\n\nThe Never Trump or Against Trump movement would gain significant momentum when National Review, a conservative political magazine, featured its Against Trump campaign in January 2016, with 22 essays from mainstream conservatives explaining their opposition to Trump.\n\nOur #AgainstTrump symposium will be live on the website at 10pmET pic.twitter.com/A47BD0aJn1 \u2014 National Review (@NRO) January 22, 2016\n\nThen, in March 2016, GOP national security leaders posted an open letter, with more than 100 signatories, opposing the prospect of a Trump presidency.\n\nAs the Republican frontrunner, Trump had defended Russian Vladimir Putin\u2019s leadership while making disparaging remarks about President Barack Obama\u2019s diplomatic efforts with Russia.\n\nTrump said of Putin: \u201cHe is a strong leader. What am I going to say, he\u2019s a weak leader? He\u2019s making mincemeat out of our president.\u201d\n\nRepublicans were also outraged by his disparaging comments about the former US Senator John McCain, who died in August 2018. Trump said in 2015 at the Family Leadership Summit in Ames, Iowa: \u201cHe\u2019s not a war hero. He was a war hero because he was captured? I like people who weren\u2019t captured.\u201d\n\nMcCain, a former Navy pilot, endured five and a half years as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam. He spent two of those years in solitary confinement at the infamous \u201cHanoi Hilton\u201d prison.\n\nIn a scathing speech in March 2016, Mitt Romney, a staunch GOP conservative and former US senator, said: \u201cIf we Republicans choose Donald Trump as our nominee, the prospects for a safe and prosperous future are greatly diminished.\u201d\n\nCould the Never Biden campaign damage the president?\n\nIt\u2019s too early to say whether the movement will actually grow and affect Biden\u2019s 2024 chances, said Perron.\n\nTrump won despite the Never Trump campaign in 2016, and the Never Biden movement in 2020 didn\u2019t stop the former vice president from winning his party nomination and eventually, the presidency.\n\nAnd while there is much evidence of overall disquiet over Biden\u2019s policies, from the Gaza war to the economy, it is unclear whether there is any organised effort \u2013 as opposed to individual attempts \u2013 from within the traditional Democratic establishment to crystallise that sentiment into a campaign against the president.\n\nBroadly, said Perron, a successful political campaign depends on what he called \u201cthe four Ms\u201d:\n\nMessage : A good story that tells you about who you are or who your opponent is.\n\n: A good story that tells you about who you are or who your opponent is. Media: To tell people who you are in an authentic way.\n\nTo tell people who you are in an authentic way. Money: To fund that political campaign.\n\nTo fund that political campaign. Make no mistake: From a poorly timed campaign start or a flawed strategy to poor research for the campaign.\n\nBut according to Perron, the \u201cAchilles\u2019 heel\u201d of any political campaign is often not the slogan but those behind it.\n\n\u201cI think the key here is authenticity. Now, you can have a great slogan, but the messenger is important and has to be authentic when he uses the slogan,\u201d he said.\n\nOne example is the Black Lives Matter campaign, which spread globally after a police officer killed George Floyd in May 2020, leading to protests against racial injustice and police brutality.\n\n\u201cBlack Lives Matter \u2026 it perfectly summarises the message of the movement, has gone viral on the internet and impacted politicians and the political discourse around the world,\u201d said Perron.",

        "text": "Trump\u2019s conviction \u2018a triumph for the rule of law,\u2019 but election impact is unclear, Berkeley scholars say\nA New York jury convicted former President Donald Trump Thursday of 34 counts of falsifying business records in an attempt to cover up an affair he had with an adult film star, part of an effort to keep damaging information from voters before the 2016 election. Berkeley legal and policy scholars described the decision as a historic moment for the country \u2014 but also one of deep uncertainty in its effect on the 2024 election.\n\nAfter the verdict was announced, Berkeley scholars reflected on the significance of the decision and what it might mean for the November election and for American democracy.\n\nBerkeley News: In constitutional and legal terms, what is the overarching significance of this indictment?\n\nErwin Chemerinsky Berkeley Law photo\n\nThe Trump verdict is a triumph for the rule of law. The core of the rule of law is that no one \u2014 not even a president or a former president \u2014 is above the law. Donald Trump repeatedly tried to argue that he was above the law in this case, as well as others.\n\nWhen the grand jury in this case subpoenaed his financial records, he took the case to the Supreme Court, arguing that as president he did not have to provide the information. The Supreme Court ruled against him. He argued to this court that he could not be prosecuted in New York State Court because he took the actions \u2014 writing the checks and falsifying the business records \u2014 when he was president.\n\nThe court rightly rejected this, and the case was tried before a jury. Donald Trump was convicted on all counts because the evidence was overwhelming that he authorized payment of hush money to Stormy Daniels, illegally concealed it as business records, and did so to help his campaign. The legal system worked as it is supposed to with a fair trial before a conscientious judge. The rule of law was upheld.\n\n\u2014 Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the UC Berkeley School of Law and preeminent constitutional scholar\n\nThe former president has been facing extraordinary legal challenges, and now has been found guilty. Thus far, though, his political standing does not seem to be affected. What does this tell us about the mindset of his base? And of the broader electorate?\n\nJake Grumbach\n\nThere is a lot of uncertainty about how Donald Trump\u2019s legal challenges, including this current case, have affected his public support.\n\nOn the one hand, it\u2019s difficult to detect any major downturns in Trump\u2019s support after indictments or prosecutions. This is consistent with U.S. public opinion becoming \u201ccalcified\u201d by partisan polarization \u2014 with vote choice and opinion growing increasingly detached from the \u201cfundamentals\u201d of public policy and how the economy is doing.\n\nOn the other hand, it might be that Trump\u2019s legal challenges have eroded his support gradually in ways that we can\u2019t easily detect statistically. Overall, we\u2019re in uncharted territory when it comes to understanding what is driving American voter behavior.\n\nRegardless of the verdict\u2019s effect on public opinion and voting, this is a big moment in history. A former head of state \u2014 especially one running for reelection \u2014 being found guilty of major crimes is a big deal. Historically, when a fair legal process has determined that a politician is guilty of crimes, it\u2019s helpful for the rule of law if elites exclude that politician from the political system.\n\n\u2014 Jake Grumbach, associate professor at the Goldman School of Public Policy\n\nThis case, and other legal cases focused on Trump, are being closely watched overseas, among both allies and adversaries. In your view, how is this guilty verdict going to be received by global audiences?\n\nSusan Hyde\n\nDemocracy requires rule of law, and former President Trump\u2019s claims of absolute immunity have helped embolden strongmen around the world who have made similar claims that the law does not apply to them, and who have sought to evade regulations aimed at ensuring citizens can exercise their democratic rights.\n\nI don\u2019t know how the world will react, but a case in which Trump is found guilty by a citizen jury for charges related to undemocratic campaign tactics should give others some faith in the potential resilience of democracy and rule of law in the face of those around the world who threaten democracy.\n\n\u2014 Susan Hyde, co-director of the Institute of International Studies and professor of political science\n\nIt\u2019s one of the most profound paradoxes: Former President Trump is accused of sexual transgressions, including sexual assault and adultery, and of lying about these cases, and yet up to this point his popularity among evangelical Christian conservatives seems undiminished. What impact might we expect among those communities from today\u2019s guilty verdict?\n\nDavid Hollinger\n\nI will be surprised if a guilty verdict changes the minds of the evangelical voters who have invested their political capital in him, and who, when they pay attention at all, routinely accept his characterization of all his legal challenges.\n\nThe significance of a guilty verdict in this case is surely with those other voters who have been inclined toward Trump, but have shown discomfort with him displayed, for example, by voting for Nikki Haley.\n\n\u2014 David A. Hollinger, professor emeritus of history\n\nWhat impact do you think a guilty verdict might have on the 2024 presidential election?\n\nEric Schickler\n\nThis situation is so distant from our prior experience that it is impossible to be confident about predictions about the impact on the presidential election.\n\nOur usual theories for understanding American politics would have told us after January 6th, 2021, that there is no way that former President Trump would be the Republican nominee in 2024 \u2014 and that if he were, he would not be running neck-and-neck (and quite possibly ahead of) President Biden.\n\nThe case for it having a substantial impact is rooted in the idea that it may remind more voters of the aspects of the Trump presidency that they disapproved of \u2014 and could help make the election more of a referendum on Trump (and all that goes along with him), as opposed to Biden.\n\nThe case against it having a substantial impact is that Trump has been a central figure in U.S. politics for nearly a decade \u2014 most voters\u2019 views of him solidified years ago. His support has changed little over the past several years, holding up in the face of events that one might have expected to be game-changers.\n\n\u2014 Eric Schickler, political scientist and co-director of the UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies\n\nTrump earlier warned that there could be violence if he was indicted, but that didn\u2019t happen. And yet, many analysts say that Trump is not afraid of soliciting violence if it\u2019s useful to him. Do you think this verdict could precipitate violence, either now or down the road? Why or why not? (Is his base deflating?)\n\nLawrence Rosenthal\n\nThe guilty verdict calls the question that has been with us since at least the Access Hollywood tape of October 2016: With Trump now a convicted felon, will his supporters stay with the man who assured us all he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and lose nary a voter?\n\nThere is also the corollary to this question: Can Trump himself maintain? Courts have by now undermined the historic pillars of his psyche: his money (half a billion for defamation) and his business organization. Now, they threaten his freedom.\n\nThe likelihood of a shift in support \u2014 whether from the base or the Trumpified GOP \u2014 seems slim. But there is a novelty here worth noting. Trump\u2019s central argument throughout the trial and going forward has been that Biden is running the show. But Trump refused to allow this and the rest of his it\u2019s-all-rigged grandstanding/campaigning to be sworn to under oath or subject to cross-examination. In the siloed world of right-wing media, there\u2019s little purchase here. The charge for the Biden campaign is to try to use this damning bit of hypocrisy to peel away support from independents and what remains of traditional \u201crock-ribbed\u201d Republicans.\n\nMeantime, Trump will escalate. Already this week, he\u2019s moved to calling Biden in charge of an assassination plot against him. Trump\u2019s undermining of the judiciary \u2014 a page one tactic from the strongman\u2019s playbook \u2014 will continue apace and foreshadow a Trump Justice Department and his allies on the Supreme Court.\n\nWe will see a lot more of contradictions like Trump\u2019s and the party\u2019s incessant harping on the politics of Judge Merchan\u2019s daughter, in contrast to Republicans having no problem with Supreme Court Justices Alito and Thomas\u2019s assertions that the politics of their wives in no way constitutes an appearance of impropriety.\n\n\u2014 Lawrence Rosenthal, founder of and lead researcher at the Berkeley Center for Right-Wing Studies and author of Empire of Resentment: Populism\u2019s Toxic Embrace of Nationalism\n\nBroadly, what impact might the indictment have on voters? More narrowly, how might it play out among Trump\u2019s base?\n\nGabriel Lenz\n\nMost voters don\u2019t pay much attention to politics and don\u2019t know much about politics. Once in a while, an event breaks through to even the least engaged voters. Trump\u2019s conviction seems like one of these events.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine that among the least attentive, this conviction wouldn\u2019t hurt Trump considerably. Among Trump\u2019s base, however, the conviction may help. It further feeds Trump\u2019s narrative that Democrats are using government to target him unfairly. It may mobilize his base to turn out at higher rates on Election Day and donate more to his campaign.\n\nWhich of these forces wins out on Election Day is anyone\u2019s guess.\n\n\u2014 Gabriel Lenz, professor of political science and author of Follow the Leader? How Voters Respond to Politicians\u2019 Policies and Performance\n\nWhat impact do you think a guilty verdict might have on the 2024 presidential election? Could it damage him among traditional Republicans and conservatives? Could it actually strengthen him?\n\nDan Schnur\n\nFor all of us who knew that it would be impossible for Donald Trump to be elected president after the Access Hollywood video became public in 2016, this should be a moment for caution. But while it\u2019s impossible to predict whether this decision will change the outcome of this year\u2019s election, it\u2019s a bit easier to see some of the ways it might affect the campaign between now and November.\n\nThe Trump campaign has already made it clear that they will use the verdict to motivate their base. But Trump\u2019s supporters were already extremely motivated, so while this may help the campaign\u2019s fundraising, their challenge has always been expanding his support beyond his committed loyalists. This is going to make that task much harder.\n\nThe more important question is whether Biden can utilize this decision to motivate his party\u2019s base. Democratic progressives have been unhappy with the president on many issues, most notably the Gaza War, and they frequently say that they see little difference between the two candidates. The question is whether the Biden campaign can convince them that preventing a convicted felon from becoming president is worth their time and effort.\n\n\u2014 Dan Schnur, lecturer at the UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies",

        "text": "How will Donald Trump's guilty verdict hit his reelection bid? Is his political fallout here?\nNEW YORK \u2013 Former President Donald Trump's 2024 White House campaign now enters unknown territory: Voter reaction to the first major party nominee to be convicted of crimes.\n\nTrump must now convince Americans he deserves a second term even after a New York jury found him guilty of all 34 felony counts tied to falsifying business records as part of a plan to influence the 2016 presidential election.\n\nWhile the challenge is unprecedented, Trump\u2019s approach is very familiar: Attack the legal system.\n\n\"This was a rigged decision, right from day one,\" Trump told reporters at the courthouse on Thursday less than an hour after being found guilty and echoing past comments the Republican has made designed to brace voters for the possibility of a guilty verdict.\n\nExpect that effort to continue now that a jury has found the former president guilty, while supporters of President Joe Biden will likely argue that the unprecedented verdict proves Trump is unfit for another four-year term.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nOn point, the Trump campaign sent out a series of fundraising solicitations within minutes of the verdict. \u201cI am a political prisoner!\u201d he told potential donors.\n\nMore rallies, more fundraisers\n\nSo what comes after Trump's historic conviction?\n\nSentencing will come on July 11, just four days before the start of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee where Trump is set to accept the GOP presidential nomination.\n\nDon't expect that looming decision to stop the former president and his campaign from holding rallies and fundraisers, giving him more chances to argue that the judge and prosecutors played politics in pursuing the hush money case against him.\n\nTrump will also be preparing for a couple of important events. There's a June 27 debate with Biden hosted by CNN in Atlanta, as well as the decision on selecting a running mate. The former president has said he will probably announce his pick at the Republican convention, scheduled for July 15-18 in Milwaukee.\n\nIn the meantime, pollsters associated with Trump and Biden will pore over data to assess how voters react to the first-ever conviction of a former president and current presidential candidate.\n\nOne thing Trump likely won't have to worry about anytime soon: Prison. He plans to appeal the verdict, and that process could drag out for years.\n\nTarget: Independents\n\nThe coming campaign will be directed at a relatively small number of voters: Independents who are on the fence between Trump and Biden.\n\nCampaign officials and independent pollsters have said for months that the verdict will have no impact on Trump partisans; nor will it affect solid Biden voters.\n\nEverybody else? No one really knows how they will react to a convicted felon running for president. After all, it's never happened.\n\nBut even a small percentage turning away from Trump could make a difference in tightly contested battleground states like Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nAt the same time, Trump has suggested that even a guilty verdict could help him because \"the people of the country see this as a rigged deal.\"\n\nIt's a pitch that still has to play out, but the trial itself does not seem to have hurt Trump much. The former president is leading Biden slightly in many polls nationwide and in battleground states, although most of those leads are within margins of error.\n\nDuring the six-week trial, Trump was able to campaign and do fundraisers on Wednesday, the court's off-day, and on weekends. Now look for him to work on the campaign just about every day of the week. That starts with a press conference Trump is planning for Friday at his namesake tower in midtown Manhattan.\n\nThe Biden campaign also enters a new phase\n\nTrump will also have to contend with a more aggressive Biden campaign, which is relishing the idea of running against the former president following a conviction.\n\nDuring the trial, Biden officials said they don't plan to focus exclusively on the guilty verdict, but the full panoply of allegations against Trump.\n\nThe former president has been indicted in three other criminal cases, including two accusing him of trying to steal the 2020 race for the White House. In civil court actions, Trump has been found liable for bank fraud and sexual abuse.\n\nMichael Tyler, the Biden campaign's communications director, said the Trump guilty verdict proves that \u201cno one is above the law,\u201d but the election will be decided on issues like the former president's threat to be a \u201cdictator on day one\u201d and his willingness to promote authoritarianism and violence.\n\n\u201cThere is still only one way to keep Donald Trump out of the Oval Office: at the ballot box,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cConvicted felon or not, Trump will be the Republican nominee for president. The threat Trump poses to our democracy has never been greater.\u201d\n\nOne thing is clear: Trump and Biden's post-conviction playbooks will be put to the test this summer as the candidates both seek a second term.\n\nSarah Longwell, who as founder of the organization Republican Voters Against Trump has conducted many focus groups, predicted that the verdict \u201cwon\u2019t be a public opinion earthquake.\u201d But she said it could still be significant.\n\n\u201cIn an election where inches will matter,\u201d she said, \u201cthis just created a new barrier for undecided swing voters: voting for a convicted felon.\u201d\n\nMore trials? Who knows?\n\nAnother unknown is whether Trump will face another trial before Election Day on Nov. 5.\n\nThe former president is facing federal criminal charges in Washington accusing him of trying to steal the 2020 election from Biden. But that trial was delayed when the Supreme Court agreed to hear Trump's claim that he should be immune from prosecution for presidential actions.\n\nThe court is expected to rule around the start of July, and a decision against Trump could mean a trial before Election Day \u2013 perhaps in the middle of the fall campaign season.\n\nA favorable Trump ruling would almost certainly push the trial past Election Day.\n\nThere are also no trial dates scheduled for Trump in the South Florida federal case over allegations the former president mishandled classified information and obstructed justice and the one in Georgia over his attempts targeting the 2020 election results in the Peach State.",

        "text": "Donald Trump found guilty on all counts in historic NY hush money trial: Recap\nIn a verdict that shook the 2024 presidential campaign, former President Donald Trump was found guilty on all 34 counts in his New York criminal hush money trial. He was convicted of falsifying business records to hide a hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 presidential election. Trump is the first former U.S. president convicted of a crime.\n\nProsecutors charged Trump with falsifying business records. They alleged Trump falsified the records to conceal unlawfully interfering in the 2016 presidential election through the $130,000 hush money payment, making the falsification charges felonies. The crime carries a penalty of up to four years in prison, with sentencing scheduled for July 11, but legal experts previously told USA TODAY the presumptive Republican nominee is likely to get only probation or a shorter sentence.\n\nTrump called the outcome a \"disgrace\" and vowed to keep fighting his conviction.\n\nThe more-than six weeks-long trial against the presumptive Republican presidential nominee \u2212 which featured dramatic clashes between lawyers and witnesses, the judge and Trump \u2212 was the first criminal trial in U.S. history against a former president.\n\nTrump's conviction marks another historic moment, with an uncertain impact on the 2024 presidential election. He is not disqualified from running for office and while polls have suggested a conviction would harm his prospects, prominent Republican supporters quickly rallied to his side.\n\nFollow along with USA TODAY's live coverage here:\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg: 'I did my job'\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said he did not have any response to Donald Trump\u2019s repeated attacks on the prosecutor and his staff, but he praised his office.\n\n\u201cI did my job. Our job is to follow the facts and the law without fear or favor. That\u2019s exactly what we did here,\u201d Bragg said. \u201cI did my job. We did our job. Many voices out there. The only voice that matters is the voice of the jury and the jury has spoken.\u201d\n\n\u2212 Bart Jansen\n\nWill Donald Trump go to jail?\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg dodged a question about whether he would seek jail time when Trump is sentenced July 11.\n\n\u201cWe will speak at that time,\u201d Bragg said.\n\nBragg also declined to say whether he would oppose a request from Trump to remain free while he appeals the verdict. Bragg said prosecutors would respond formally at sentencing July 11.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to let our words in court speak for themselves,\u201d Bragg said.\n\n\u2212 Bart Jansen\n\nTrump still faces criminal prosecution in these other three cases\n\nWith Donald Trump guilty on all charges in his Manhattan hush money trial, he still faces criminal charges in three other cases, including two for allegedly trying to illegally steal the 2020 election he lost to President Joe Biden.\n\nIn all, Trump faced a combined 88 criminal counts, including the 34 in Manhattan that he was convicted of Thursday by a jury. That leaves 54 counts between the three other cases, two of them in federal court that were brought by special counsel Jack Smith on behalf of the Justice Department.\n\nOne of those involves the retention of classified documents. The other federal case overseen by Smith accuses Trump of trying to subvert the 2020 election results.\n\nThe fourth case, in Fulton County, Ga., accuses Trump and 14 co-defendants \u2212 including some of his former lawyers, and administration aides \u2212 of trying to overturn Trump's loss in the Peach State in 2020.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty in all of the cases. None of them have trial dates scheduled, and legal experts largely concur that it's unlikely that any will begin before election day on Nov. 5, a likely rematch between Biden and Trump as the presumptive Republican nominee.\n\n\u2212Josh Meyer\n\nWatch DA Alvin Bragg's press conference live\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg Jr. will hold a press conference Thursday evening following the conviction of Donald Trump.\n\nThe press conference is scheduled to be held at 6:30 p.m. ET at the 8th Floor Training Room in New York, the DA's office said in a release.\n\nYou can watch his comments live here.\n\n\u2212 Anthony Robledo\n\nWhat was Trump found guilty of?\n\nTrump was found guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records.\n\nEach count is tied to a different business record that prosecutors argued Trump was responsible for changing in order to either conceal or commit another crime.\n\nThose records include 11 checks paid to former lawyer Michael Cohen, 11 invoices from Cohen and 12 entries in Trump's ledgers.\n\nThe jury found that Trump authorized a plan to reimburse Cohen for the $130,000 hush money payment issued to Stormy Daniels and spread the payments across 12 months disguised as legal expenses.\n\n\u2212 Kinsey Crowley\n\n'Trump is in a deep hole here': Former federal prosecutor reacts to verdict\n\nKevin O\u2019Brien, a former federal prosecutor now practicing at Ford O\u2019Brien Landy, said Trump could appeal whether the evidence was sufficient to convict him. But Trump can no longer challenge the credibility of witnesses such as former lawyer Michael Cohen and porn actress Stormy Daniels because the jury believed them, O\u2019Brien said.\n\n\u201cTrump is in a deep hole here,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like he gets to start over. That\u2019s not how the appeal system works.\u201d\n\nThe jury weighed the evidence and decided that witnesses such as former lawyer Michael Cohen and porn actress Stormy Daniels were credible.\n\nThe counts each carry maximum sentences of four years, but legal experts say Judge Juan Merchan could give him probation or a shorter sentence as a first-time offender to a non-violent offense. The felony convictions don\u2019t prohibit Trump from campaigning or potentially winning the White House.\n\n\u201cHe could still easily wind up president of the United States,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that would prevent that from happening.\u201d\n\n\u2212 Bart Jansen\n\nCan Trump run for president now?\n\nYes, even after being convicted on felony counts, the Thursday verdict does not impact Donald Trump's ability to seek another term in the White House. The Constitution is pretty clear \u2212 here are the qualifications to serve as president.\n\nBe a natural-born citizen of the U.S.\n\nHave lived in the U.S. for at least 14 years\n\nBe at least 35 years old\n\n\u2212 Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhat happens to Trump now? Trump sentencing date\n\nJudge Juan Merchan has scheduled Trump's sentencing for July 11, and Trump is out free until then.\n\nBecause this is Trump's first felony offense, his sentence is likely to be as light as probation or home confinement. If he does receive a sentence, it would probably be less than a year.\n\nTrump is likely to appeal the conviction. That would push any jailtime until after the election.\n\n\u2212 Kinsey Crowley\n\nWho were the key witnesses in Donald Trump's historic trial\n\nFormer Trump lawyer Michael Cohen was a significant witness testifying that he submitted invoices for \u201clegal expenses\u201d that Trump knew were to reimburse him for paying $130,000 to silence porn actress Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election. But Trump lawyer Todd Blanche accused Cohen of lying on the stand when he testified he notified Trump about the payment to Daniels. In closing arguments, Blanche called Cohenthe \u201cMVP of liars\u201d and \u201cthe embodiment of reasonable doubt.\u201d\n\nDaniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, described the alleged sexual encounter in enough detail that Merchan questioned why defense lawyers didn\u2019t object more to block her testimony. Trump has repeatedly denied he had sex with Daniels and Blanche argued the payment \u201cstarted out as an extortion\u201d whether the allegation was true or not.\n\nDavid Pecker, the former CEO of American Media Inc., which owned the National Enquirer, said he agreed in a meeting with Trump and Cohen in August 2015 to be the \u201ceyes and ears\u201d of Trump\u2019s presidential campaign to buy negative stories about the candidate and never publish them.\n\nPecker acknowledged paying former Playboy model Karen McDougal $150,000 for her story and then refusing to pay for Daniels because Trump hadn\u2019t reimbursed him. Cohen provided a recording, which prosecutor Joshua Steinglass called \u201cjaw-dropping,\u201d of Trump mentioning the $150,000 figure.\n\n\u2212 Bart Jansen\n\nCan Trump go to prison?\n\nYes. Each felony count of falsifying business records \u2212 elevated to a felony because prosecutors proved their purpose was to commit or conceal another crime \u2212 carries a maximum sentence of four years. However, New York caps such sentencing the type of felonies Trump faced \u2013 Class E felonies \u2013 at 20 years.\n\nBut given Trump doesn't have a criminal record and wasn't convicted of a violent crime, such a high sentence is very unlikely, according to legal experts. Several spoke to USA TODAY ahead of the trial about what could happen if Trump were convicted. Nearly all predicted that, if convicted, Trump would get a sentence ranging from just probation to up to four years in prison, and likely falling within the lower end of that range.\n\n\u2212 Aysha Bagchi\n\nDonald Trump reacts to guilty verdict\n\nDonald Trump quickly reacted to the jury's decision finding him guilty on all 34 criminal counts.\n\n\u201cThis is just a disgrace,\u201d Trump told reporters in the hallway outside the courtroom. \u201cWe didn\u2019t do anything wrong. I\u2019m an innocent man.\u201d\n\nTrump ignored shouted questions about whether he would drop out of the presidential campaign.\n\n\u201cThis is long from over,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep fighting. We\u2019ll fight to the end and we\u2019ll win.\u201d\n\n\u2212 Bart Jansen\n\nPeople surrounding courthouse react\n\nOutside the courthouse, anti-Trump demonstrators cheered and drivers honked their horns as news of the guilty verdicts spread. \u201cGuilty!\u201d several people shouted out.\n\n\u2212 David Jackson\n\nJury reaches a verdict\n\nThe jury has reached a verdict in former President Donald Trump's New York criminal hush money trial, which centers on allegations that he falsified business records to hide a hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 presidential election.\n\nJurors confirmed that they had reached a verdict in a note signed by the foreperson at 4:20 p.m. local time. Jurors have requested an extra 30 minutes to fill out forms and take other steps, according to Judge Juan Merchan.\n\nThe former president, his attorneys, prosecutors reporters and others were waiting in near silence in the courtroom as the jury entered the courtroom.\n\n\u2212 Aysha Bagchi\n\nA drama-filled trial\n\nThe six-week trial featured dramatic clashes between lawyers and witnesses, the judge and Trump.\n\nThe testimony included tense moments, such as defense lawyer Todd Blanche accusing Trump\u2019s former lawyer Michael Cohen, of lying on the stand and former Trump spokesperson Hope Hicks breaking into tears.\n\nMeanwhile, Judge Juan Merchan threatened to jail Trump if he continued to violate a gag order against talking about witnesses participating in the case. Merchan also scolded Blanche for an \u201coutrageous\u201d statement in closing arguments that the jury shouldn\u2019t \u201csend someone to prison\u201d based on Cohen\u2019s testimony.\n\nA flock of Republican surrogates showed up to support Trump, and one conspiracy theorist set himself on fire outside the courthouse.\n\n\u2212 Bart Jansen\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this story quoted Trump as saying \"this is far from over.\"",

        "text": "Lawmakers OK bill to require \u2018faithful\u2019 electors in 2024, loosen campaign finance rules\nSPRINGFIELD \u2014 As the 2024 presidential election approaches, Illinois appears likely to join most of the rest of the country in requiring that the state\u2019s Electoral College votes go to the winner of the state\u2019s popular election.\n\nThe measure is part of a broad package of election-related legislation which also includes a provision loosening restrictions on what political parties can do with campaign funds and a state-level response to a controversy in the south suburbs.\n\nThe entire package was approved 51-3 in the Senate, with three Senators voting present. The House was more divided, passing the measure 68-38. The bill now goes to Gov. JB Pritzker for final approval before becoming law.\n\nIn United States presidential elections, voters on Election Day cast a vote for president, but also for electors associated with a particular candidate. Legally, these electors are the ones who actually cast a deciding vote in the presidential election, usually in mid-December.\n\nThe bill would require the state\u2019s electors to take a new pledge prior to appearing on the ballot. Failing to honor the pledge under the proposal would result in them being removed from their position and replaced with an alternate elector.\n\nThese electors have been under increased scrutiny in the past decade, due in large part to the 2016 election, which saw Donald Trump win the presidency despite losing the popular vote \u2013 the fourth such occurrence in U.S. history.\n\nWhile Illinois has never had an elector vote for someone who didn\u2019t win the popular vote, other states have, including seven electors from three states in 2016.\n\nThe legislation concerning the Electoral College is based on model legislation that has been adopted in 12 other states, according to the Chicago-based Uniform Law Commission , which published the model law in 2010.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of it is to make sure the popular vote is protected by electors in the Electoral College,\u201d Rep. Daniel Didech, D-Buffalo Grove said Saturday in an interview.\n\nDidech was not formally a sponsor of the package but is a delegate to the Uniform Law Commission and introduced the model bill as separate legislation last year.\n\nIf the measure is signed, Illinois would join 33 other states with laws in place requiring electors to vote for the candidates that they pledged to support, according to a March analysis of state laws by the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nAfter the 2020 election, while no electors cast \u201cfaithless\u201d votes, the Electoral College again became the focus of controversy. Some allies of Donald Trump allegedly orchestrated a scheme to send a slate of electors outside of the legal process, thereby securing a second Trump term in 2020.\n\nEighteen people, including Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani and former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, were indicted in Arizona state court on charges related to the scheme in April of this year.\n\nParty campaign funds\n\nThe bill also removes a restriction on the way political parties handle primary campaigns. Under the proposal, candidates for state and federal office would be able to accept an unlimited amount of campaign cash from political parties.\n\nCurrently, candidates can receive unlimited support during a general election, but in primaries, parties are capped on contributing to individual candidates. For example, prospective members of the House are limited to $75,000, candidates for Senate and Supreme Court are limited to $125,000, and statewide candidates are limited to $200,000.\n\n\u201cWhat we have now came from another era,\u201d bill sponsor Rep. Maurice West, D-Rockford, said during floor debate on Saturday. \u201cWe do not see the need for that cap any longer.\u201d\n\nThis provision was met with pushback from Republicans, who pointed to former House Speaker Michael Madigan, who is awaiting trial on bribery and racketeering charges. He was known for his use of the Democratic Party of Illinois\u2019 campaign war chest as a lever to exert control over his caucus.\n\n\u201cThe former leader of your Democrat Party, that you want to give all this control, is on the brink of going to prison, we hope. He should,\u201d Rep. Blaine Wilhour, R-Beecher City, said. \u201cWhy in the world would we be making these organizations more powerful than they already are? Were they not powerful enough before?\u201d\n\nThe primary cap was initially codified in 2009 as part of a sweeping reform campaign championed by then-Gov. Pat Quinn. Quinn signed the law less than a year after taking over the governorship from Rod Blagojevich, who was sent to prison for corruption related charges.\n\nReform for Illinois, an advocacy group known for backing ethics and campaign reform, condemned the move in a statement published Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a step backward that will increase legislative leaders\u2019 power over their members while supercharging the election money arms race and depriving constituents of the chance to be represented by more independent candidates,\u201d Alisa Kaplan, the head of the organization, said.\n\nVoter rolls\n\nThe legislation also codifies that the public has access to the state\u2019s voter registration list. The database, which is required by federal law and routinely shared with local governments and political committees, is tightly protected by the Illinois State Board of Elections.\n\nPrior to a 2020 lawsuit brought by the conservative Public Interest Legal Foundation, digital copies of the voter registration database were restricted to only government entities and registered political committees.\n\nThe bill codifies a court order from that lawsuit requiring the public have access to a redacted database \u2013 after paying a fee. Members of the public can also inspect the voter database for accuracy in-person at the Springfield board of elections office.\n\nThe bill also lays out what voter information cannot be used for: \u201cany personal, private, or commercial purpose, including, but not limited to, the intimidation, threat, or deception of any person or the advertising, solicitation, sale, or marketing of products or services.\u201d\n\nThe voter rolls have been the subject of a recent controversy following their allegedly illegal publication on a series of websites that have been characterized as a conservative influence operation.\n\nThose websites are published by Local Government Information Services, a company backed by one-time candidate for governor and longtime Republican activist Dan Proft.\n\nRead more: Election officials to weigh whether Darren Bailey and GOP operative Dan Proft illegally coordinated\n\nLGIS\u2019 publication of the voter information initially included dates of birth. Earlier this month, Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul sued the company for publishing the data. After a court order requiring the company to take down the information, LGIS removed birth dates from their websites.\n\nAs of Wednesday morning, voters\u2019 names and street addresses were still accessible on several of its websites.\n\nIllinois State Board of Elections spokesperson Matt Dietrich told Capitol News Illinois that the voter database provision of the law was written, in part, as a response to the LGIS lawsuit.\n\nSpringfield\u2019s response to \u2018super mayor\u2019\n\nAnother piece would require that the compensation for township supervisors in Cook County may not be increased during a term. An outgoing supervisor would also be prohibited from lowering the salary for their successor without lowering their own salary.\n\nThe bill echoes a situation in Chicago\u2019s south suburbs centered on Dolton Mayor and Thornton Township Supervisor Tiffany Henyard, who styles herself as a \u201csuper mayor\u201d on social media.\n\nLate last year, Henyard proposed a measure that would decrease the salary of Thornton Township supervisor from $224,000 to $25,000, but only for non-incumbents, meaning her salary would remain unchanged, even if she was reelected, according to reporting from Fox32.\n\nWhile West didn\u2019t mention Henyard specifically, he suggested that the measure was in response to a real-world situation that he described as \u201ca way of being spiteful.\u201d\n\nHenyard has also faced criticism for using taxpayer funds for billboards promoting herself and was sued by a local bar which claimed she denied the business a permit because it didn\u2019t contribute to her election campaign.\n\nCapitol News Illinois is a nonprofit, nonpartisan news service covering state government.

        "summary": " Donald Trump is unlikely to be disenfranchised by felony convictions in the New York case . An estimated 4.4 million Americans with felony convictions could not vote in 2022 elections . Trump could seek clemency to restore his voting rights in Florida, where he established his official residency in 2019 .",
        "text": "Can Trump vote in November now that he's been convicted of felony charges?\nFormer President Donald Trump is joining the millions of Americans whose voting rights depend on their criminal records after a New York jury convicted him of felony charges in a hush money case.\n\nBut experts say Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, is unlikely to be disenfranchised by the felony convictions in the New York case, noting that it would come down to whether he goes to prison as part of his sentence.\n\nForty-eight states prohibit some or all Americans with felony convictions on their records from voting, according to the Sentencing Project, and an estimated 4.4 million Americans \u2014 about 2% of the voting-age population \u2014 could not vote in the 2022 elections because of those laws. The group estimates that more than 1 million of them live in Florida, where Trump established his official residency in 2019.\n\nFlorida defers to other state laws when it comes to disenfranchising voters who are tried and convicted elsewhere. That means Florida voters like Trump lose their voting rights only if the states where they were convicted would disenfranchise them for the crimes, too. And if the states of their convictions would restore their voting rights, so would Florida, said Blair Bowie, an attorney at the Campaign Legal Center who advocates for the end of felony disenfranchisement.\n\nNew York prohibits those serving time behind bars for felony convictions from voting, and voting rights are restored as soon as a person leaves prison. Those convicted of felonies who do not go to prison never lose their voting rights.\n\nIn the New York case, \u201cthe only way he wouldn\u2019t be able to vote is if he is in prison on Election Day,\u201d Bowie said.\n\nA 12-person jury on Thursday found Trump guilty on all 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in connection with a hush money payment to adult film actor Stormy Daniels near the end of the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nTrump\u2019s sentencing hearing is scheduled for July 11 and he faces up to four years in prison. But experts say prison time for a first-time, nonviolent offender is less likely. And even if he were ordered to serve time, the inevitable appeals process would most likely delay a sentence well past the election, allowing Trump to cast a ballot for himself in his third presidential bid.\n\nIn the event of Trump's losing his voting rights in Florida, there would also be avenues for him to regain them.\n\nTrump could seek clemency to restore his voting rights in Florida, where Gov. Ron DeSantis \u2014 his former rival in the 2024 GOP presidential primaries \u2014 oversees a process that allows people with felony convictions to regain their voting rights.\n\nBowie said DeSantis typically requires those with felony convictions to complete the terms of their sentencing before they apply, but he has the power to change the rules.\n\nConviction in federal court \u2014 where Trump faces charges in Washington, D.C., in connection with attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election and in Florida for his handling of classified documents \u2014 could pose a greater threat to Trump's voting rights in Florida, she added, as he would need to seek clemency in Florida or a presidential pardon to vote again in the state in that scenario. But it's unclear whether those cases will go to trial before Election Day.\n\nBob Libal, an organizer at the Sentencing Project, said Trump's experience is not unique.\n\n\"The confusion around President Trump's eligibility to vote is representative of a confusion that a lot of people have, and I think that that confusion dissuades people from voting,\" he said.\n\n\u201cIt can be quite complicated. We\u2019re talking about Trump, who\u2019s a person who has access to lots of lawyers, and even here you can tell it\u2019s quite complicated,\u201d Bowie added. \u201cFor the average person who doesn\u2019t have access to attorneys, it can be almost impossible.\u201d",

        "text": "Trump found guilty on 34 felony counts in NY hush money trial \u2022 Nebraska Examiner\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Jurors in New York state court on Thursday found Donald Trump guilty on all 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments to a porn star ultimately to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe first-ever criminal trial of a former U.S. president wrapped up in Manhattan, marking an extraordinary moment in American history not only for a former leader, but for one who is seeking to again hold the Oval Office. Trump, the Republican Party\u2019s presumed 2024 presidential nominee, is now a convicted felon.\n\nThe jury deliberated for more than 11 hours, beginning Wednesday just before 11:30 a.m. Eastern and delivering the verdict to Justice Juan Merchan just after 5 p.m. Thursday, according to reporters at the courthouse.\n\nNebraskans react See sidebar at bottom of story for reaction from Nebraska elected officials and political candidates. Comments will be added as they are issued.\n\nNew York does not allow recording in the courtroom but provides public transcripts of the proceedings. States Newsroom covered the trial in person on May 20.\n\nTrump now faces penalties ranging from probation to up to four years in prison for each charge of falsifying business records in the first degree.\n\nMerchan set a sentencing date for July 11 at 10 a.m. That\u2019s just days before the Republican National Convention, where Trump is expected to be officially nominated as the party\u2019s presidential candidate.\n\nNew York state prosecutors charged 34 felonies against the former president for each of the 11 invoices, 11 checks, and 12 ledger entries tied to reimbursing his former personal lawyer Michael Cohen.\n\nCohen, often referred to as Trump\u2019s former \u201cfixer,\u201d said during trial testimony that he wired $130,000 to adult film star and director Stormy Daniels days before the 2016 election to silence her about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump.\n\nThree criminal cases, two federal and one in Georgia, also still hang in the balance for Trump, but the likelihood of another trial happening before November\u2019s election is slim.\n\nTrump speaks after verdict\n\nTrump briefly spoke to news cameras outside the courtroom, criticizing the proceeding as a \u201crigged, disgraceful trial.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe real verdict is going to be Nov. 5 by the people, and they know what happened here and everybody knows what happened here,\u201d Trump said in remarks live-streamed and cataloged on C-SPAN.\n\nAs he has repeated almost daily for the cameras, Trump again called Merchan a \u201cconflicted\u201d judge and falsely claimed the case \u201cwas done by the Biden administration.\u201d\n\nThe charges were brought by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, whom Trump described during his post-verdict comments as \u201cSoros-funded,\u201d a common mantra from Trump\u2019s party referring to Hungarian-American billionaire philanthropist George Soros.\n\nDuring his roughly three-minute remarks, Trump also referred to immigration at the U.S. Southern border, a major campaign rallying cry for Republicans.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have the same country anymore. We have a divided mess. We\u2019re a nation in decline, serious decline. Millions and millions of people pouring into our country right now,\u201d Trump said before exiting the hallway without answering shouted questions from reporters.\n\nDespite being a convicted felon, Trump will still be able to vote in November in Palm Beach County, Florida, where he is registered, as long as he is not incarcerated.\n\nThat\u2019s because Florida law only bars voting for convicts tried in a separate state if that state also restricts them; a 2021 New York law restored voting rights for convicted felons following a release from prison and regardless if they are on parole, according to reporting by PolitiFact.\n\nHouse speaker sees \u2018shameful day in American history\u2019\n\nRepublicans in Congress and other top GOP officials gathered with Trump at the courthouse for support during the trial, and members of the GOP immediately decried the verdict.\n\nU.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican who was among those who made the trek, released a statement saying the verdict marked \u201ca shameful day in American history.\u201d\n\n\u201cDemocrats cheered as they convicted the leader of the opposing party on ridiculous charges, predicated on the testimony of a disbarred, convicted felon,\u201d Johnson wrote. \u201cThis was a purely political exercise, not a legal one.\u201d\n\nJohnson was referring to the testimony from Cohen, who served time in prison for campaign finance crimes related to hush money payments.\n\nSen. Joni Ernst, an Iowa Republican, blasted it as the result of an unfair political process.\n\n\u201cThis was never about justice. It was always about politics,\u201d she wrote on X. \u201c Americans see through Democrats\u2019 weaponization of our justice system and this sham trial as a desperate attempt to persecute Trump and block his re-election.\u201d\n\nThe Trump campaign almost immediately solicited donations following the verdict, posting a link on his Truth Social platform to his WinRed donation portal.\n\nTrump\u2019s son Eric Trump reacted on X with \u201cMay 30th, 2024 might be remembered as the day Donald J. Trump won the 2024 Presidential Election.\u201d\n\nVideo posted from reporters outside the courthouse showed a black SUV driving slowly outside the courthouse while members of the news media held cameras and some people scattered in the crowd waved Trump flags and shouted \u201cwe love you.\u201d\n\n\u2018The jury has spoken\u2019\n\nIn a Thursday evening press conference, Bragg thanked the jurors and his team of prosecutors.\n\nWhile affirming the case\u2019s historical importance, Bragg said his office worked the case as they would any other, countering the GOP narrative that the case was politically motivated.\n\nThe case was decided on \u201cthe evidence and the law alone,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cDonald J. Trump is guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree to conceal a scheme to corrupt the 2016 election,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhile this defendant may be unlike any other in American history, we arrived at this trial \u2013 and ultimately today at this verdict \u2013 in the same manner as every other case that comes to the courtroom doors: By following the facts and the law, and doing so without fear or favor.\u201d\n\nBragg praised \u201cthe 12 everyday New Yorkers,\u201d who paid careful attention to a complicated documents-based case to reach a unanimous decision. The jurors\u2019 service represented the \u201ccornerstone\u201d of the \u201cphenomenal\u201d U.S. system of justice, he said.\n\nAsked if he wanted to respond to any of the personal attacks Trump launched against him and his prosecution team, Bragg declined.\n\nAnother reporter asked Bragg about criticism of his investigation of the case and his decision to bring a prosecution.\n\n\u201cI did my job. Our job is to follow the facts and the law without fear or favor. And that\u2019s exactly what we did here,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMany voices out there,\u201d he added. \u201cThe only voice that matters is the voice of the jury. And the jury has spoken.\u201d\n\nTrials in limbo in D.C., Georgia, Florida\n\nThe verdict brought to a close the historic first criminal proceeding against a former sitting American president, albeit at the state level.\n\nTrump is currently mired in a fight for absolute immunity from federal criminal charges accusing him of scheming to overturn the 2020 presidential election results.\n\nA U.S. Supreme Court decision on his immunity claim is pending. Justices heard arguments in the case on April 25.\n\nMeanwhile, in Florida, federal District Judge Aileen Cannon has indefinitely postponed the U.S. case against Trump for mishandling and refusing to return classified documents that he hid at his Mar-a-Lago estate after he left office.\n\nTrump faces another state case in Georgia, along with several co-conspirators, on racketeering and conspiracy charges related to the state\u2019s 2020 presidential election results. The case has been held up due to pretrial disputes over alleged misconduct by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis.\n\nBiden campaign reacts\n\nA spokesman for President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign, Michael Tyler, said in a statement that the verdict showed \u201cno one is above the law\u201d and that Trump remained a threat to democracy whom voters should reject.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump has always mistakenly believed he would never face consequences for breaking the law for his own personal gain,\u201d Tyler wrote. \u201cBut today\u2019s verdict does not change the fact that the American people face a simple reality. There is still only one way to keep Donald Trump out of the Oval Office: at the ballot box. Convicted felon or not, Trump will be the Republican nominee for president.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe threat Trump poses to our democracy has never been greater,\u201d Tyler continued. \u201cHe is running an increasingly unhinged campaign of revenge and retribution, pledging to be a dictator \u2018on day one\u2019 and calling for our Constitution to be \u2018terminated\u2019 so he can regain and keep power. A second Trump term means chaos, ripping away Americans\u2019 freedoms and fomenting political violence \u2014 and the American people will reject it this November.\u201d\n\nThe Biden White House had much less to say.\n\nIan Sams, a spokesperson for the White House Counsel\u2019s Office, said in a one-sentence email: \u201cWe respect the rule of law, and have no additional comment.\u201d\n\nMembers of Congress speak out\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, said in a statement the guilty decision from the jurors represented \u201ca devastating defeat for any American who believes in the critical legal tenet that justice is blind.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis verdict will not withstand an appeal, and was only brought as an attempt to interfere with the 2024 election,\u201d Scalise wrote. \u201cThe radical partisan Democrats behind this abuse of our justice system will not prevail. The voters will settle this on November 5th.\u201d\n\nRhode Island Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, chair of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s federal courts subcommittee, released a statement saying that an \u201cindividual who has been convicted of 34 felony counts and shows zero respect for the rule of law is not fit to lead the greatest nation in the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only in honest courtrooms that the former president has been unable to lie and bully his way out of trouble,\u201d Whitehouse said. \u201cAmericans trust juries for good reason.\u201d\n\nNorth Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis posted on social media that he was \u201cshocked by the verdict considering that this case should have never been brought forward.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom the beginning, it was clear that a radical, politically-motivated state prosecutor was using the full weight of his office to go after President Trump at the same time he turned a blind eye to violent criminals,\u201d Tillis wrote. \u201cI expect and hope that President Trump will appeal this verdict to address fundamental questions, including whether President Trump received a fair trial and whether the Manhattan D.A. even had jurisdiction on a federal election matter.\u201d\n\nMinnesota Democratic Rep. Betty McCollum said the jury\u2019s decision showed that America\u2019s justice system functioned the way it was supposed to.\n\n\u201cToday our system of justice worked, and former President Trump was found guilty on all 34 counts by a jury of American citizens,\u201d McCollum wrote on social media. \u201cNo person is above the law.\u201d\n\nA \u2018sham\u2019 or an \u2018affirmation\u2019?\n\nIowa Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds wrote in a statement the trial was a \u201csham.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor years, Democrats like Alvin Bragg have been trying to put President Trump in jail with complete disregard for our democracy and the will of the American people,\u201d Reynolds wrote. \u201cThe only verdict that matters is the one at the ballot box in November where the American people will elect President Trump again.\u201d\n\nFlorida Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz wrote on social media that the jury\u2019s guilty verdict wasn\u2019t political.\n\n\u201cA former president being convicted is nothing to be celebrated, but it is an affirmation that nobody is above the law,\u201d Moskowitz wrote. \u201cThis verdict was reached by a jury of Trump\u2019s peers, by citizens of the American justice system, not by a judge or by a political opponent.\u201d\n\nOhio Republican Rep. Jim Jordan, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, rejected the verdict, writing on social media it was a \u201ctravesty of justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Manhattan kangaroo court shows what happens when our justice system is weaponized by partisan prosecutors in front of a biased judge with an unfair process, designed to keep President Trump off the campaign trail and avoid bringing attention to President Biden\u2019s failing radical policies,\u201d Jordan wrote.\n\nVirginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine posted on social media the \u201cverdict is proof that no one is above the law in this country.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also tragic in this way \u2014 Americans put the reins of leadership in the hands of a person whose character is so far beneath the office that no rational adult would ever encourage young people to emulate \u2026 his behavior,\u201d Kaine wrote.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s lack of character has caught up to him,\u201d Kaine added. \u201cAnd Americans \u2014 once again \u2014 have received a clear warning about a person who wants to seize leadership once again. I pray that we heed the warning.\u201d\n\nHouse Committee on Oversight and Accountability Chairman James Comer, a Kentucky Republican, said Thursday was a \u201csad day for all Americans.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis verdict in New York is another example of Democrats being relentless in their pursuit to weaponize the courts, abuse America\u2019s judicial system, and target President Joe Biden\u2019s political opposition,\u201d Comer wrote. \u201cOne thing is clear: Democrats are afraid to face Donald Trump. Americans will make their voices heard this November.\u201d\n\nFormer Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, the Republican nominee for the state\u2019s open U.S. Senate seat, urged restraint in a social media post.\n\n\u201cRegardless of the result, I urge all Americans to respect the verdict and the legal process,\u201d Hogan wrote. \u201cAt this dangerously divided moment in our history, all leaders \u2014 regardless of party \u2014 must not pour fuel on the fire with more toxic partisanship. We must reaffirm what has made this nation great: the rule of law.\u201d\n\nStates Newsroom reporters Jacob Fischler and Jennifer Shutt contributed to this report.",

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nNow that a New York jury has convicted former President Donald Trump of all 34 felony charges of falsifying business records, the next obvious question is: Can a convicted felon run for president?\n\nDefinitely.\n\nA further question is more complicated: Could Trump, as a felon, vote for himself? Probably.\n\nStarting with the easy question \u2026\n\nCan a convict run for president?\n\nThe US Constitution lays out just three requirements for presidential candidates. They must:\n\nBe a natural born citizen.\n\nBe at least 35 years old.\n\nHave been a US resident for at least 14 years.\n\nTrump meets all three requirements. There is, arguably, another criterion laid out in the 14th Amendment, where it states that no one who has previously taken an oath of office who engages in insurrection can be an officer of the US. But the US Supreme Court ruled earlier this year that Congress would have to pass a special law invoking this prohibition. That\u2019s not happening any time soon.\n\nJudge Juan Merchan has scheduled Trump\u2019s sentencing for July 11, which happens to be four days before the start of the Republican National Convention that is scheduled to take place in Milwaukee.\n\nIt is technically possible, although perhaps unlikely for a first-time offender, that Trump could be sentenced to prison time.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump reacts as the verdict is read in his criminal trial over charges that he falsified business records on Thursday in New York. Christine Cornell\n\nCNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig said most Class E felony convictions, the least serious type of felony in New York, result in non-prison sentences \u2013 often a combination of probation, fines and community service.\n\nAs a former president, Trump enjoys lifetime Secret Service protection and he will continue to get protection wherever he is, according to Anthony Guglielmi, chief of communications for the Secret Service.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s outcome has no bearing on the manner in which the United States Secret Service carries out its protective mission. Our security measures will proceed unchanged,\u201d Guglielmi said in a statement to CNN.\n\nThere is also precedent for presidential campaigns, albeit unsuccessful ones, being mounted from prison cells.\n\nEugene Debs, the Socialist leader, conducted his 1920 presidential campaign from federal prison in Atlanta, where he was serving a 10-year sentence for sedition. He had encouraged Americans to oppose the draft in World War I.\n\nThe Supreme Court, in that case, had affirmed his conviction, arguing he was convicted not for opposing the draft but for encouraging people not to comply with it. The decision keeping Debs in jail was written by then-Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes just a few months before Holmes did a famous about-face on free speech that put the US on course for the way we view the First Amendment today.\n\nThomas Doherty, an American studies professor at Brandeis University, wrote last year about Debs, noting that he remained in prison as votes were cast and counted \u2013 he got nearly a million, more than 3% of the vote. Even after the Sedition Act was repealed, Debs was kept in prison. Then-President Woodrow Wilson refused to issue a pardon. Wilson\u2019s successor and Debs\u2019 rival in 1920, Warren G. Harding, later commuted Debs\u2019 sentence in 1921.\n\nAnd now to the more difficult question \u2026\n\nCan a convicted felon vote?\n\nIt depends.\n\nTrump\u2019s right to vote in Florida in November\u2019s election will depend on whether he is sentenced to a term in prison and if he has finished serving that prison sentence by the time of the election.\n\nEach state makes its own rules. Vermont and Maine allow felons to vote from prison. There has been movement in multiple states toward allowing felons on parole to cast ballots.\n\nTrump is now a Florida resident \u2013 and Florida voters, in 2018, overwhelmingly backed a referendum to reenfranchise convicted felons. But Republican lawmakers who control the state\u2019s government first delayed and then qualified the reenfranchisement by requiring that felons must pay all fines and fees associated with their sentence.\n\nI talked to Neil Volz, deputy director of the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition, an organization that works to help reenfranchise formerly incarcerated people. He predicted Trump will have little problem voting since Florida actually defers to the jurisdiction of a felony conviction as to whether a felon can vote. In New York, after a law passed in 2021, any convicted felon who is not incarcerated is eligible to register to vote.\n\nRead more from the Campaign Legal Center.\n\nPatrons at the Hawk and Dove bar watch the news after former President Donald Trump was found guilty on all 34 counts in his criminal trial on May 30, in Washington, DC. Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\nEven if the judge ultimately tried to give Trump prison time, it is highly unlikely that Trump\u2019s right to appeal his conviction would be exhausted before Election Day. If, somehow, Trump was convicted in one of the two federal criminal cases against him before Election Day, that might be another story.\n\nThere are other problems for many post-incarceration felons in Florida, as CNN has reported previously, although they would not apply to Trump. For starters, there is no clearinghouse of data about what fees are required. It has led to confusion and kept many people from voting.\n\n\u201cThere are still a lot of people who are confused about their eligibility, and that\u2019s why we continue to work with the state and the election professionals to fix the system,\u201d Volz told me. \u201cBecause people need to know whether they\u2019re eligible or not on the front end of the process.\u201d\n\nVolz said his group is making progress with the state to make it much easier for people to confirm their eligibility.\n\nCNN\u2019s Tierney Sneed contributed to this report.",

        "text": "Presidential Election Could Decide Fate of Extra Obamacare Subsidies\nWhen Cassie Cox ended up in the emergency room in January, the Bainbridge, Georgia, resident was grateful for the Obamacare insurance policy she had recently selected for coverage in 2024.\n\nCox, 40, qualified for an Affordable Care Act marketplace plan with no monthly premium due to her relatively low income. And after she cut her hand severely, the 35 stitches she received in the ER led to an out-of-pocket expense of about $300, she said.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine what the ER visit would have cost if I was uninsured,\u201d she said.\n\nCox is among 1.3 million people enrolled in health coverage this year through the ACA marketplace in Georgia, which has seen a 181% increase in enrollment since 2020.\n\nMany people with low incomes have been drawn to plans offering $0 premiums and low out-of-pocket costs, which have become increasingly common because of the enhanced federal subsidies introduced by President Joe Biden.\n\nSouthern states have seen the biggest enrollment bump of any region. Ten of the 15 states that more than doubled their marketplace numbers from 2020 to 2024 are in the South, according to a KFF policy brief. And the five states with the largest increases in enrollment \u2014 Texas, Mississippi, Georgia, Tennessee, and South Carolina, all in the South \u2014 have yet to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, driving many residents to the premium-free health plans.\n\nBut with the federal incentives introduced by the Biden administration set to expire at the end of 2025, and the possibility of a second Donald Trump presidency, the South could be on track to see a significant dip in ACA enrollment, policy analysts say.\n\n\u201cGeorgia and the Southern states generally have lower per-capita income and higher uninsured rates,\u201d said Gideon Lukens, a senior fellow and the director of research and data analysis for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonpartisan, Washington, D.C.-based research organization. If the enhanced subsidies go away, he said, the South, especially states that haven\u2019t expanded Medicaid, will likely feel a bigger effect than other states. \u201cThere\u2019s no other safety net\u201d for many people losing coverage in non-expansion states, Lukens said.\n\nWhen Cox was enrolling in Obamacare last fall, she qualified for premium tax credits that were added to two major congressional legislative packages: the American Rescue Plan Act in 2021, and the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022. Those incentives \u2014 which gave rise to many plans with no premiums and low out-of-pocket costs \u2014 have helped power this year\u2019s record Obamacare enrollment of 21 million. The extra subsidies were added to the already existing subsidies for marketplace coverage.\n\nThe states that didn\u2019t expand Medicaid and have high uninsured rates \u201cgot most of the free plans,\u201d said Cynthia Cox, a KFF vice president who directs the health policy nonprofit\u2019s program on the ACA. Zero-premium plans existed before the new subsidies, she added, but they generally came with high deductibles that potentially would lead to higher costs for consumers.\n\nEmail Sign-Up Subscribe to KFF Health News' free Morning Briefing. Your Email Address Sign Up\n\nA Trump presidency could jeopardize those extra subsidies. Brian Blase, a former Trump administration official who advised him on health care policy, said that eliminating the extra subsidies would bring the marketplace back to the ACA\u2019s original intent.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not sustainable or wise to have fully taxpayer-subsidized coverage,\u201d said Blase, who is now president of the Paragon Health Institute, a health policy research firm. People would still qualify for discounts, he said, but they wouldn\u2019t be as generous.\n\nKaroline Leavitt, a spokesperson for Trump, did not answer a reporter\u2019s questions on the future of the enhanced subsidies under a new Trump administration. Despite his comments at the end of last year that he is \u201cseriously looking at alternatives\u201d to Obamacare, Leavitt said Trump is not campaigning to terminate the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cHe is running to make health care actually affordable, in addition to bringing down inflation, cutting taxes, and reducing regulations to put more money back in the pockets of all Americans,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile views on Obamacare may be divided, the wide support for subsidies crosses political lines, according to a KFF Health Tracking Poll released in May.\n\nAbout 7 in 10 voters support the extension of enhanced federal financial assistance for people who purchase ACA marketplace coverage, the poll found. That support included 90% of Democrats, 73% of independents, and 57% of Republicans surveyed.\n\nThe enhanced assistance also allowed many people with incomes higher than 400% of the poverty level, or $58,320 for an individual in 2023, to get tax credits for coverage for the first time.\n\nBesides the financial incentives, other reasons cited for the explosion in ACA enrollment include the end of continuous Medicaid coverage protections related to the covid public health emergency. About a year ago, states started redetermining eligibility, known as the \u201cunwinding.\u201d\n\nRoughly one-quarter of those who lost Medicaid coverage moved to the ACA marketplace, said Edwin Park, a research professor at the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families.\n\nIn Georgia, Republican political leaders haven\u2019t talked much about the effect of the Biden administration\u2019s premium incentives on enrollment increases.\n\nInstead, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, among others, has touted the performance of Georgia Access, an online portal that links consumers directly to the ACA marketplace\u2019s website or to an agent or broker. That agent link can create a more personal connection, said Bryce Rawson, a spokesperson for the state\u2019s insurance department, which runs the portal. Employees from the agency and from consulting firms helped market the no-premium plans throughout the state, he said.\n\nYet Georgia Access didn\u2019t become fully operational until last fall, during open enrollment for the marketplace. Republicans also credit a reinsurance waiver that, according to Rawson, increased the number of health insurers offering marketplace coverage in the state, leading to more competition.\n\nReinsurance is likely not a major reason for a state\u2019s increased Obamacare enrollment, said Georgetown\u2019s Park. And a study published in Health Affairs found that Georgia\u2019s reinsurance program had the unintended consequences of increasing the minimum cost of subsidized ACA coverage and reducing enrollment among individuals at a certain income level, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution recently reported.\n\nThe state\u2019s insurance department said the study \u201cdoes not accurately reflect the overall benefits the reinsurance program has brought to Georgia consumers.\u201d\n\nWhen asked whether the governor would support renewal of the enhanced subsidies, Garrison Douglas, Kemp\u2019s spokesperson, said the matter is up to Congress to decide.\n\nAnother reason for the soaring ACA enrollment is the 2023 fix to the \u201cfamily glitch\u201d that had prevented dependents of workers who were offered unaffordable family coverage by employers from getting marketplace subsidies.\n\nStates that have run their own marketplaces, though, generally have not seen the same level of enrollment increases. Those 18 states, plus the District of Columbia, have expanded Medicaid. Georgia will join the list of states running their own exchanges this fall, making it the only state to operate one that has not expanded Medicaid.\n\nThe federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services credits a national marketing campaign and more federal funding for navigators, the insurance counselors who provide education about marketplace health coverage and free help with enrollment.\n\nThat level of financial support for navigators may be in jeopardy if Trump returns to the White House.\n\nThe Biden administration injected nearly $100 million in funding for navigators in the enrollment period for coverage this year. The Trump administration, on the other hand, awarded just $10 million a year for navigators from 2018 to 2020.\n\nThe marketplace is usually \u201ca transitional place\u201d for people coming in and out of coverage, KFF\u2019s Cox said. \u201cThat marketing and outreach is pretty essential to help people literally navigate the process.\u201d",

        "text": "2. Israeli views of Biden, the U.S. and diplomacy in resolving the conflict\nIn our survey fielded from March 3 to April 4, 2024 \u2013 prior to the Biden administration\u2019s statement about halting the shipment of some arms to Israel \u2013 Israelis offer somewhat mixed reviews of President Joe Biden and his actions during the conflict.\n\nFor example, while 57% of Israelis express confidence in U.S. President Joe Biden to do the right thing regarding world affairs, a similar share (60%) disapprove of his handling of the ongoing war. Still, roughly seven-in-ten Israelis want the U.S. to play a major role in diplomatically resolving the conflict, more than say this about the United Nations or any other country we asked about.\n\nConfidence in Biden\n\nA slim majority of Israelis (57%) have confidence in Biden to do the right thing regarding world affairs.\n\nOverall, older Israelis are more confident in Biden than younger Israelis. For example, among Israelis ages 65 or older, 69% express at least some confidence in Biden, compared with 56% of those ages 18 to 29.\n\nIsraelis on the ideological right or center are more confident in Biden than those on the left. About six-in-ten on the right or in the center express confidence in Biden, compared with roughly half of Israelis who place themselves on the left.\n\nJewish Israelis also have more confidence in Biden than Arab Israelis do (66% vs. 21%). About half of Arabs say they have no confidence at all in Biden to do the right thing on the world stage.\n\nConfidence in Biden is tied to people\u2019s approval of his handling of the Israel-Hamas war. Israelis who approve of his handling of the war are much more confident in him than those who disapprove (92% vs. 33%). Additionally, Israelis who think Biden is striking the right balance between support for Israelis and Palestinians are much more confident in him to do the right thing regarding world affairs (84% confident) than those who say he is favoring Israel too much (36%) or the Palestinians too much (39%).\n\nHow views of Biden have changed over time\n\nConfidence in Biden among Israelis is down from 68% last year and closer to the share who had confidence in him in 2022 (60%). Israeli Jews\u2019 views follow the same pattern.\n\nIn contrast, among Israeli Arabs, views of Biden have declined significantly since 2022. (We were unable to survey in Israel during the first year of Biden\u2019s presidency because of the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n\nWhile support declined since last year among all ideological groups, the greatest decreases have come among those in the center (down 20 percentage points) and on the left (down 21 points). Meanwhile, confidence among those on the right has fallen much less (down 7 points).\n\nViews of how Biden is handling the Israel-Hamas war\n\nMore Israelis disapprove than approve of how Biden is dealing with the conflict between Israel and Hamas (60% vs. 39%).\n\nArabs in Israel are more critical of Biden\u2019s handling of the war than Jews (86% vs. 53%). Indeed, 71% of Arabs say they strongly disapprove of his approach to the conflict. Views among Jewish Israelis are more mixed.\n\nAs with overall confidence in Biden, opinions about which side he favors in the conflict are related to evaluations of how he has handled the war. Those who say Biden is striking the right balance are more likely to approve of his handling of the conflict (63%) than those who say he is either favoring the Israelis (28%) or the Palestinians (16%) too much.\n\nWho is Biden favoring in the conflict, or is he striking the right balance?\n\nRoughly four-in-ten Israelis say Biden is favoring each group the right amount while roughly a quarter each think he is either favoring the Israelis (27%) or the Palestinians (25%) too much.\n\nArab Israelis (86%) overwhelmingly say Biden is favoring the Israelis too much. Only 11% of Jewish Israelis share this view. Instead, about half of Jews (48%) say he\u2019s striking the right balance, and an additional 32% say he is favoring the Palestinians too much.\n\nThose on the left are most likely to say Biden favors the Israelis too much, while those in the center are most likely to say he is favoring each group the right amount. Those on the right are most likely to say he is favoring the Palestinians too much.\n\nThe largest share of Israelis across age groups say Biden is striking the right balance. However, those ages 50 and older are more likely to say this than those ages 18 to 49 (46% vs. 38%). Younger Israelis are instead more likely than older Israelis to say that Biden is favoring the Israelis too much (30% vs. 22%).\n\nViews of the U.S.\n\nIsraelis broadly view the U.S. in a positive light: 77% have a favorable view of the country, including 43% who say they have a very favorable opinion. While the U.S. is still largely popular, the share of Israelis who have a favorable view of it fell 10 points since last year, when 87% held this view.\n\nDemographic patterns in views of the U.S. are similar to confidence in Biden:\n\nJewish Israelis are much more likely than Arab Israelis to have a favorable view of the U.S. (90% vs. 29%). Among Arabs, favorability ratings of the U.S. are at an all-time low, having dropped 15 points since 2023.\n\nViews of the U.S. are generally more positive among Israelis on the ideological right (85%) and center (84%) than on the left (55%). While favorable views are down from last year among those across the ideological spectrum, the decrease is three times larger among those on the left (down 22 points) than those in the center or on the right (both down 7 points).\n\nIsraelis ages 50 and older are more likely than their younger counterparts to have a favorable view of the U.S. (85% vs. 72%).\n\nAdditionally, Israelis who have confidence in Biden are more likely to have favorable views of the U.S. than those who have less confidence (97% vs. 51%). Similarly, those who approve of his handling of the Israel-Hamas war have more favorable views of the U.S. than those who disapprove (97% vs. 64%).\n\nWho Israelis want to play a role in diplomatically resolving the war\n\nIn the survey conducted March 3 to April 4, 2024 \u2013 amid off-again, on-again ceasefire negotiations mediated by Egypt and Qatar with involvement by senior U.S. officials \u2013 a large majority of Israelis (72%) said the U.S. should play a major role in diplomatically resolving the war between Israel and Hamas.\n\nEgypt received the next largest share of support for diplomatic involvement, with 45% of Israelis saying it should play a major role.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, just 27% of Israelis support Qatar playing a major role; similar shares say this about Saudi Arabia (29%) and the United Nations (24%).\n\nSupport for a major U.S. role is broadly popular across the Israeli ideological spectrum. However, those on the left are more open than those on the right to involvement by other diplomatic actors.\n\nBoth Jews (74%) and Arabs (63%) in Israel favor the U.S. playing a major part in resolving the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nHowever, Arabs are more likely than Jews to support each of the other diplomatic actors asked about playing a major role. In fact, about as many Arab Israelis support Qatar (66%) and Egypt (63%) taking on major roles as support the U.S. doing so (63%).",

What happens next after guilty verdict\nA Manhattan jury has convicted Donald Trump on all 34 counts of falsifying business records in the hush-money case.\n\nThe immediate next question is: what punishment should the former US president receive?\n\nIt\u2019s a decision that rests entirely with Juan Merchan, the judge overseeing the case. The crimes Trump has been found guilty of, falsifying business records in the first degree, are class E felonies in New York, the least serious category, and punishable by up to four years in prison. His sentencing is set for 11 July.\n\nBut Trump is unlikely to be sentenced to prison, experts say. He is a first-time offender, and the crime he has been found guilty of is a non-violent paper crime.\n\n\u201cI think the judge would probably not incarcerate him under those circumstances alone,\u201d said Cheryl Bader, a law professor at Fordham University who called any sentence of incarceration \u201cunlikely\u201d.\n\n\u201cBut also given that he is a former president, has a Secret Service detail and is also the presumptive Republican nominee, I think a term of incarceration would be logistically very difficult, but also would have political implications that I think Judge Merchan would want to avoid.\u201d\n\nAny punishment is likely to consist of fines, probation, community service or some combination of those.\n\n\u201cI would like to see community service \u2013 picking up trash on the subway,\u201d said Karen Friedman Agnifilo, a former top prosecutor in the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office.\n\nMuch could depend on how Merchan interprets Trump\u2019s conduct, including any lack of remorse.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine we will see a remorseful, apologetic Trump if it comes time for sentencing,\u201d Bader said. \u201cJudges also consider the harm caused. On one hand, Judge Merchan could view this as a technical recording violation to cover up tawdry conduct, causing only minimal harm. On the other hand, he could view Trump\u2019s conduct as inflicting deep harm on the entire country by depriving the voting public of their right to cast an informed vote in the highest-ranking national election.\u201d\n\n2:57 Inside Donald Trump\u2019s hush-money trial: three key testimonies \u2013 video\n\nThe jury did not have the option of convicting Trump of a misdemeanor \u2013 of falsifying business records but not in service of another underlying crime. Trump\u2019s attorneys could have asked Merchan to give the jury that option, but they did not do so.\n\nBoth the prosecutors and Trump\u2019s lawyers will submit recommendations for sentencing. So too will the probation office, which will put together a confidential presentencing report for the judge.\n\nTrump will almost certainly quickly appeal. Any punishment would then probably be on hold while an appeal is pending.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Trump on Trial Free newsletter Stay up to date on all of Donald Trump\u2019s trials.

Trump has 30 days to file a notice of appeal of the guilty verdict, and then six months to file a full appeal to the first judicial department, which hears appeals from New York county. If a conviction were upheld, Trump would then likely appeal to the New York court of appeals, the seven-member body that is the highest appellate court in New York state. That court has discretion over whether to hear the case or not.\n\nThe issues argued on appeal would likely be complex legal questions \u2013 for example, whether the judge gave appropriate instructions to the jury and allowed the right evidence to be included or excluded. Facts, and the credibility of witnesses, would not be issues on appeal.\n\nIf the conviction is upheld by the New York court of appeals, Trump would likely appeal to the US supreme court, which could also choose whether or not to take the case. Because the case is under New York state law, getting it into the US supreme court would require Trump to convince the justices that there is some federal or constitutional question at stake.\n\nThe conviction will not affect Trump\u2019s legal ability to run for president. The constitution does not bar felons from running for office. Whether he could serve as president from prison is untested. He would not be able to pardon himself from any conviction, since it is a state crime.\n\nThe conviction will probably not affect Trump\u2019s ability to vote in this fall\u2019s election. Florida, where he is registered, allows people with an out-of-state conviction to vote if the state where they were convicted allows it. In New York, someone with a felony conviction can vote as long as they are not incarcerated.\n\nMerchan has already punished Trump twice during the case for violating a gag order in place, and the way the judge handled both episodes could offer insight into how he will approach any possible punishment for Trump. It underscores that Merchan is keenly aware of the logistical difficulty of incarcerating Trump and the broader political implications of doing so.\n\n\u201cMr Trump, it\u2019s important to understand that the last thing I want to do is to put you in jail. You are the former president of the United States and possibly the next president, as well,\u201d Merchan said on 6 May, when he issued a $1,000 fine holding Trump in contempt of court for the 10th time. He went on to explain why putting Trump in jail at that time was \u201ctruly a last resort for me \u2026 I also worry about the people who would have to execute that sanction: the court officers, the correction officers, the Secret Service detail, among others. I worry about them and about what would go into executing such a sanction.\n\n\u201cOf course, I\u2019m also aware of the broader implications of such a sanction. The magnitude of such a decision is not one-sided. But, at the end of the day, I have a job to do, and part of that job is to protect the dignity of the judicial system and compel respect,\u201d he added.",

Kennedy, Jr.'s independent presidential campaign has drawn supporters who don't see themselves represented by Democrats or Republicans. Although he likely won't win the 2024 presidential election, who shows up to vote for him could help determine if President Biden or Former President Donald Trump do. JOSH EDELSON/AFP via Getty Images / AFP\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s presidential campaign is the political equivalent of a Rorschach test: it\u2019s open to interpretation, it aims to be a lot of different things to a lot of different people and its significance and meaning are squarely in the eyes of the beholder.\n\nTHANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor\n\nKennedy\u2019s independent bid is marketed as an alternative choice for those who don\u2019t like President Biden, former President Donald Trump or the two-party system the country operates under.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans see the campaign as a threat that could siphon away enough of their voters in key swing states to tip the election to the other side.\n\nBut what about his supporters?\n\nThey\u2019re people like Susan Parker, who traveled from Norman, Okla., to Nashville this month for a comedy show put on by the campaign at the historic Ryman Auditorium.\n\nDespite never donating to a presidential candidate before, Parker maxed out campaign contributions to RFK, as he's often known, after listening to him speak on various podcasts and in other longform interviews where he shared his political philosophy.\n\n\u201cI feel like I've gotten to know him as a person, I see him think and everything,\u201d she added. \u201cSo that's what excites me about him being in this race \u2014 it\u2019s a third choice.\u201d\n\nSusan Parker came from Oklahoma to Tennessee to hear Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. speak at a campaign comedy show. She donated the maximum amount to his independent presidential run and feels he is inspiring compared to President Biden and former President Donald Trump. Stephen Fowler, NPR\n\nParker, clad in a shirt that reads \u201cThe Remedy is Kennedy 2024,\u201d has historically voted for Republicans, including Trump, and says her choice is less about voting against Trump and Biden and more about enthusiasm for Kennedy himself.\n\n\u201cHe inspires me personally, and I enjoy listening to him talk,\u201d she said. \u201cI have a little bit of a cringe factor when I listen to the other two major candidates.\u201d\n\nSo many of RFK\u2019s supporters mention his candidacy as an important alternative representing issues that are most important to them.\n\n\u201cI certainly align with him on his views on the health of America and his wanting to get us all more healthy,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn't know what his stances were on other political areas like the war and the middle class, but as I listened to him, I realized, no, he knows what he's doing. He knows what he's talking about. And I like what he's saying.\u201d\n\nWhat draws people to RFK?\n\nShe\u2019s not alone. An overwhelming issue of importance to Kennedy supporters is health, and more specifically vaccines. It\u2019s part of his campaign\u2019s embrace of skepticism about the government\u2019s role in, well, everything.\n\nBrittany Ruiz from nearby Franklin, Tenn., said at the comedy show that she considered Kennedy a longtime family friend after years of work in opposition to vaccine mandates.\n\nRuiz said while she\u2019s a fan of Trump, Kennedy is better on the things that matter to her, like tackling corruption, standing up to big pharmaceutical companies and rolling back government agencies\u2019 purview in daily life.\n\n\u201cI would say that RFK Jr. has been strong on all the issues I feel like all of us want to be talked about or want to have addressed and want to have handled,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so for me, my allegiance is more toward the fact that he is speaking on issues that no other candidate is talking about. That's why I'm a big fan.\u201d\n\nMany of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.'s campaign supporters say his views on improving health are important to them, and push back on claims that he is anti-vaccine. Stephen Fowler, NPR\n\nOutside of a recent rally in Austin, Tony Farmer told NPR that Kennedy\u2019s focus on addressing the rise of chronic disease diagnoses is a crucial issue he feels Biden and Trump don\u2019t adequately discuss.\n\n\u201cI like that RFK Jr.\u2019s actually addressing the why: why our nation is so sick?\u201d he said. \u201cBecause to me, nothing's more important than our health. Health is an economic issue. Our health is a social justice issue. Our health is an environmental issue. It's tied up into so many other things. To me, it's one of the most important things and it's not being talked about.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s important to note Kennedy supporters interviewed by NPR push back against claims that he is anti-vaccine, or that they are either.\n\nFarmer, for example, pointed to Kennedy\u2019s record as an environmental lawyer \u2014 like cleaning up the Hudson River and suing Monsanto over cancer-causing chemicals \u2014 as something that gets overlooked by the talk of vaccines.\n\n\u201cThis dude is a badass activist, and it seems like all people know about who haven't researched him is, like, he's anti-vax, he's anti-vaccine, he's anti-vaccine,\u201d Farmer said. \u201cAnd when you actually listen to him talk, he's not anti-vaccine. He wants safe vaccines.\u201d\n\nBut in listening to Kennedy, or his vice presidential pick Nicole Shanahan, skepticism of vaccinations and conspiracies about their effects dominate campaign conversations more than mentions of Monsanto or global conflict, inflation or immigration.\n\nAnd Kennedy's rise to political prominence cannot be seen without looking at his role fighting against current vaccine standards.\n\nLike the nebulous inkblots of a Rorschach test, Kennedy\u2019s supporters see the candidate\u2019s activism and ideology differently than how they believe the mainstream media, Democrats and Republicans portray him.\n\n\u201cWhen I started hearing him talk and actually like listening to the words that he was saying,\u201d Farmer said, \u201cit's like, wow, what I've been hearing in the media about this guy isn't true. He's not crazy. He's not a kook!\u201d\n\nTHANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor\n\nPresidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. speaks at the Libertarian National Convention on May 24, 2024 in Washington, DC. Kennedy is seeking qualification to be part of the first presidential debate currently scheduled on June 27 between Democrat President Biden and Republican, former President Donald Trump. Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images / Getty Images North America\n\nDistrust of the existing political system\n\nWhile waiting for the RFK rally in Austin, Cathleen Yanco and Paul DeSantis shared why they support his campaign.\n\n\u201cPaul started following him first, and I was like, \u2018I can't believe you're following him, you know he's anti-vax, he's this, he's that',\u201d Yanco said. \u201cAnd I did do the Google searches to try and find what I could on him, and it was all just the soundbites, the negative soundbites.\u201d\n\nAfter doing more research, including hearing more of Kennedy\u2019s thoughts about things like freedom of speech, affordable housing and the influence of money in food, pharmaceuticals and other industries, Yanco said she apologized to DeSantis for initially criticizing his support for Kennedy.\n\n\u201cI do question everything I hear now,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel like my eyes have been opened since learning about Kennedy and looking a little more in depth, not just mainstream and not just Joe Rogan's podcast, not the popular stuff, but going a little more in depth. And I'm actually quite upset that I was fooled like that.\u201d\n\nYanco voted for Democratic candidates in the past and said she is open minded to the platform of any candidate running, but said she does not currently trust what Democrats or Republicans say.\n\nHer thoughts echo that of many RFK voters who say they feel like the two major parties don\u2019t have a place for \"normal people\" who don\u2019t have extreme views.\n\nTony Farmer, at that same Austin event, said his disconnect with the Democratic Party is over foreign policy.\n\n\u201cRemember when Democrats were taking George Bush to task for the wars in Iraq? What happened to the anti-war left? Where did it go?\u201d he asked. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m staying still for the most part, and the Democratic Party is just moving further and further left.\u201d\n\nFarmer said Kennedy\u2019s views and platform excite him and provide a new opportunity to buck a polarizing two-party system.\n\n\u201cIt's at a point where I can't have an honest, open debate with someone and say something against Trump without someone being, \u2018Well, you must love Biden then,\u2019 or you can't say anything bad about Biden without someone saying, \u2018You must love Trump, then,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt's such a mess.\u201d\n\nDon't call him a spoiler\n\nThe next president will likely not be Robert F. Kennedy Jr. He faces an uphill battle to get on the ballot in all 50 states, let alone to win significant share of the popular vote, but that\u2019s not deterring those who have already committed to vote for him.\n\nSusan Parker at the campaign comedy show in Nashville said RFK\u2019s campaign is raising more awareness of the importance of who our politicians are and how they impact policy.\n\n\u201cThere will be victory to be claimed, because I think a lot of people will take notice that didn't take notice before like myself,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it's very exciting to finally be part of an election process.\u201d\n\nOn that note, every Kennedy supporter interviewed by NPR at these two events did not think they were wasting their vote, despite no real path to victory, and despite the likelihood that his presence could affect who ultimately does win: Biden or Trump.\n\n\u201cI don't want to be told, \u2018Well, if you support Kennedy, then that means Trump's going to get into office,\u2019\u201d Cathleen Yanco said. \u201cWell, we need some changes. And unless we start somewhere, even if that means the potential for someone I detest getting into office\u2026 so be it.\u201d\n\n\u201cA vote for Kennedy is a vote for Kennedy, he's not a spoiler for anyone,\u201d Paul DeSantis added. \u201cI mean, all we want is another voice in America, and he's it. We\u2019re just tired of the division between the two parties.\"\n\nThe Kennedy-shaped inkblot that's still very much up to interpretation is how his voters will impact the 2024 presidential rematch between Trump and Biden.\n\nThese RFK voters have previously voted for Democrats and Republicans, vote both regularly and infrequently and cut across a demographic and ideological spectrum.\n\nBoth Democrats and Republicans share concerns that RFK\u2019s independent bid will draw enough disaffected voters from their party to tilt the scales in an election that could once again be decided by narrow margins in a handful of states.\n\nWho Kennedy\u2019s voters could or would otherwise support is harder to gauge this far out from November, though there are signs that his independent campaign is focused on one side of the aisle.\n\nAn NPR review of campaign finance records show roughly 95% of RFK\u2019s itemized donors have not given money to a presidential candidate since 2020. Of those who have, almost all contributions were to Republicans.\n\nKennedy and Shanahan\u2019s prominent views around vaccine skepticism cut across the ideological spectrum, while conspiracies around the coronavirus are also more commonly found on the political right.\n\nLast week, RFK spoke at the Libertarian Party's national convention, attacking Trump over his response to the pandemic and unsuccessfully sought the party's nomination for president.\n\nUltimately, RFK\u2019s impact will come down to a few basic metrics: what states the campaign successfully gains ballot access in, how many of them are swing states, how strategically swing voters view their choices and how many RFK voters actually show up to the polls.\n\nNPR's Ashley Lopez contributed reporting.\n\nCopyright 2024 NPR",

        "text": "What the Election Could Mean for the Mexico City Policy and U.S. Foreign Aid\nOverview\n\nThe outcome of the next presidential election will have significant implications for U.S. global health programs and policy, as well as U.S. international engagement more broadly. Among other things, if President Trump is elected, he is expected to reinstate the expanded Mexico City Policy (MCP) from his first term, which applied to most U.S. global health assistance. Moreover, there are indications that the policy could be expanded even further, as recommended by Project 2025 (a series of proposals for a new administration from a broad coalition of conservative organizations) \u2013 specifically, one of its proposals recommends expanding the MCP to include virtually all U.S. foreign assistance. Members of Congress have also introduced legislation to this effect for the past several years. Given that Project 2025\u2019s proposals are widely seen as a blueprint for a next Trump administration, this analysis outlines the potential reach of such a proposal, looking at the amount of funding, the number of organizations, the range of foreign assistance sectors, and other variables that could be affected. Among the key findings:\n\nIn FY 2022, more than $51 billion in U.S. foreign aid, spanning almost 180 countries, was obligated to non-USG prime recipients, the funding most likely to be directly implicated by the expansion proposal (additional funding could be subject to the policy if it were ultimately provided, directly or indirectly, to non-USG recipients).\n\nNotably, this is tens of billions more than the amount of global health assistance likely implicated under the Trump administration\u2019s previously expanded policy ($7.3 billion in FY 2020), and significantly more than the amount of family planning assistance implicated by the policy, when in place, during earlier administrations (between $300-$600 million).\n\nMore than half of the $51 billion (58%) was provided to multilateral organizations, recipients that have, to date, not been subject to the policy before. Indeed, nine of the top 10-funded prime recipients were multilateral organizations.\n\nBy sector, humanitarian assistance accounted for the largest share of funding, followed by economic development, two sectors that would be newly subject to the policy under the expansion proposal. Health was the third largest sector.\n\nThere were more than 2,400 non-USG prime recipients of U.S. foreign aid in FY 2022, those subject to the policy under the proposal, a significantly higher number than for health alone (662 prime recipients). This number should be considered a floor, since any sub-recipients of U.S. foreign aid would also be subject to the MCP. Although most funding was provided to multilaterals, most prime recipients were foreign entities (61%); U.S.-based entities accounted for 35%\n\nWhether or not the full extent of the expansion proposal could be instituted (for example, there would likely be legal challenges to some aspects of the proposal, which could limit its reach), it would represent a significant expansion in terms of funding and number of organizations, well beyond the reach of the expanded policy that was in place during the Trump administration.\n\nBackground\n\nThe Mexico City Policy (MCP) is a U.S. government (USG) policy that \u2013 when in effect \u2013 has required foreign non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to certify that they will not \u201cperform or actively promote abortion as a method of family planning\u201d using funds from any source (including non-U.S. funds) as a condition of receiving U.S. global family planning assistance and, when in place under the Trump administration (called \u201cProtecting Life in Global Health Assistance\u201d), most other U.S. global health assistance. First announced in 1984 by the Reagan administration, the MCP has been rescinded and reinstated by subsequent administrations along party lines since and has been in effect for 21 of the past 40 years. It has also been steadily expanded to apply to additional types of U.S. foreign assistance and recipients over time (see Table 1). Should it be implemented, the Project 2025 proposal \u2013\u201cProtecting Life in Foreign Assistance\u201d \u2013 would mark the most significant expansion of the policy to date. Specifically, the proposal seeks to:\n\napply the MCP to all U.S. foreign assistance (not just global health assistance ) provided to non-USG recipients, including sectors (such as humanitarian aid) and agencies (such as global health funding appropriated to Department of Health and Human Services agencies) that have not been subject to the policy before;\n\nexpand recipients subject to the policy to also include multilateral organizations (such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria), foreign governments, and U.S.-based NGOs (not just foreign NGOs); and\n\ninclude funding provided through contracts (not just grants and cooperative agreements).\n\nTable 1 Expansion of the Mexico City Policy Over Time Phase 1^ Phase 2 Phase 3 Project 2025 Proposal President/Term Ronald Reagan, 1985-1989\n\nGeorge H.W.

(Note that \u201cgrants under contracts\u201d were subject to the policy.) *Clarified in 2019 that under the policy, U.S.-supported foreign NGOs could not provide any type of financial support, no matter the source of funds, to any other foreign NGO that performs or actively promotes abortion as a method of family planning.\n\nFindings\n\nTo assess the potential reach of the Project 2025 proposal, this analysis looks at U.S. government foreign assistance obligation data for FY 2022 (the most recent year for which complete obligation data by sector are available) to quantify the amount of funding and number and type of prime recipients that could be affected. Obligations were analyzed because the MCP applies to funding once obligated to a recipient. Data were obtained from foreignassistance.gov, the U.S. government\u2019s centralized data portal for budgetary and financial data provided by more than 20 federal agencies that manage foreign assistance programs. The analysis focused on funding obligations provided to non-USG recipients, as this is the funding most likely to be subject to the MCP expansion proposal (see Box 1 for key terms, Methodology for more detail, and Appendix for detailed data).\n\nBox 1: Key Terms Obligation: A binding agreement that will result in outlays of funds immediately or at a later date.\n\nA binding agreement that will result in outlays of funds immediately or at a later date.

Multilateral Organization: an organization that is jointly supported by multiple governments and, often, other partners (versus bilateral efforts, which are carried out on a country-to-country basis); includes specialty agencies of the United Nations (U.N.) and international financing mechanisms that pool and direct resources from multiple public and private donors for specific causes.\n\nOf the $67.5 billion of U.S. foreign assistance obligated in FY 2022, $51.5 billion (76%) was provided to non-USG prime recipients, the funding most likely subject to the expanded MCP proposal. The remainder \u2013 funding provided to U.S. government agencies ($15.1 billion, or 22%) or unknown recipients ($850 million, or 2%) \u2013 would only be subject to the policy if funding were subsequently awarded to a non-USG recipient.\n\nThe remainder \u2013 funding provided to U.S. government agencies ($15.1 billion, or 22%) or unknown recipients ($850 million, or 2%) \u2013 would only be subject to the policy if funding were subsequently awarded to a non-USG recipient. Notably, this is tens of billions more than the amount of global health assistance likely implicated under the Trump administration\u2019s previously expanded policy ($7.3 billion in FY 2020), and significantly more than the amount of family planning assistance implicated by the policy, when in place, during earlier administrations (between $300-$600 million).

See Box 2. The majority of funding was provided to multilateral organizations ($29.8 billion, or 58%), which would be newly subject to the policy under the proposal. The non-profit sector received the next largest amount of funding ($11.1 billion, or 22%), followed by the private sector ($8.6 billion, or 17%). Smaller amounts were provided to foreign governments ($862 million, or 1.7%) and educational institutions ($1.2 billion, or 2.3%) (see Figure 1).\n\nThe non-profit sector received the next largest amount of funding ($11.1 billion, or 22%), followed by the private sector ($8.6 billion, or 17%).

Foreign recipients, both governments and NGOs, received $6.6 billion (13%); foreign governments would also be newly subject to the policy. Collectively, the $51.5 billion in foreign assistance was provided to 178 countries, with more countries likely reached through \u201cregional\u201d and \u201cworldwide\u201d activities. This is significantly more countries than would be reached with global health assistance alone (93 countries).\n\nBox 2: Examples of Funding Newly Subject to the MCP Under Proposal By Recipient Type:\n\n-Multilateral organizations: $29.8 billion\n\n-Foreign governments: $862 million\n\n-U.S. NGOs: $10.4 billion in non-health sectors^\n\n-Foreign NGOs: $3.9 billion in non-health sectors By Sector:\n\n-Non-health sectors: $40.9 billion, including (for example): Humanitarian assistance: $16.4 billion\n\nEconomic development: $12.1 billion\n\nPeace and security: $2.4 billion\n\nDemocracy, human rights, and governance: $2.1 billion\n\nEducation and social services: $1 billion -Health sector: $4 billion in multilateral and foreign government funding Note: Amounts by recipient type and sector are not mutually exclusive categories. ^ Not included in this total is $4.8 billion provided to U.S. NGOs in the health sector, as that funding would have been subject to the Trump administration\u2019s expanded MCP if provided to foreign NGO sub-recipients. Still, it is important to note that under the previous policy, U.S. NGOs were not directly subject to MCP abortion restrictions. Under the proposal, they would be subject to these restrictions for the first time.\n\nThe humanitarian assistance sector accounted for the largest share of funding ($16.4 billion, or 32% in FY 2022), followed by economic development ($12.1 billion, or 23%), two sectors that would be newly subject to the policy (see Figure 2). Health was the third largest sector, with $10.6 billion (21%); remaining sectors accounted for $4.6 billion (9%) or less, each.\n\n(see Figure 2). Health was the third largest sector, with $10.6 billion (21%); remaining sectors accounted for $4.6 billion (9%) or less, each.

The top 10 highest-funded recipients accounted for nearly half (47%, or $24.2 billion) of all funding provided to non-USG prime recipients in FY 2022 (see Figure 5). Nine of the top 10-funded recipients were multilateral organizations, though this varied by sector. For example, in the humanitarian assistance sector, the top 10 were split between multilaterals and non-profits, and in the health sector, four of the top 10 were U.S. non-profits (see Appendix Tables 5-6).\n\nMethodology This analysis looks at FY 2022 foreign assistance obligation data, downloaded from foreignassistance.gov on January 29, 2024. ForeignAssistance.gov is the U.S. government\u2019s centralized data portal for budgetary and financial data provided by more than 20 federal agencies that manage foreign assistance programs. Obligations are binding agreements that will result in outlays of funding, immediately or sometime in the future. The MCP, when in place, is applied to funding that is obligated to recipients, as a condition of their awards. Data on funding amounts and recipients were analyzed by agency, sector, location, and type of entity. To the extent possible, COVID-19 emergency funding was excluded from this analysis, as it represented one-time funding for a particular event. Recipients were categorized into the following groups (see table below) based on classifications already present in the ForeignAssistance.gov data as well as background research, where such classifications were not provided. Each recipient was reviewed, and the review sought to correct any mis-categorization in the original data and remove duplicates. \u201cOther/Unknown\u201d recipients were those that could not be easily identified as belonging to a particular recipient type/sub-type. Where it was not possible to identify a recipient as a single, implementing entity, they were excluded from analysis looking at the number of unique recipients.",

Presidential race\n\nThe Biden campaign is calibrating a more aggressive strategy to reach American voters as former President Donald Trump\u2019s historic hush money trial nears its end. President Joe Biden slammed his presumptive 2024 opponent at a Philadelphia rally on Wednesday and reaffirmed that he would appoint progressives to the Supreme Court if elected to a second term. In an explicit warning about the stakes of the upcoming election, Biden suggested that he expects vacancies on the high court over the next four years because some of the nine justices have entered their seventies. Meanwhile, speculation is rising that Trump may select a running mate off the public\u2019s radar, despite touting several potential vice presidential picks for months. At the same time, the Trump team is railing against his hush money trial, which will resume for a second day of jury deliberations in the coming hours.\n\n2. Flag controversy\n\nSupreme Court Justice Samuel Alito told lawmakers in a letter Wednesday that he will not recuse himself from cases involving the 2020 presidential election or the January 6, 2021, US Capitol riot despite concerns about two controversial flags that have flown on his properties. The New York Times published a photo this month of an inverted American flag raised at Alito\u2019s Virginia home in 2021 \u2014 a symbol for former President Donald Trump\u2019s supporters who falsely claimed widespread fraud in the presidential election. Alito said the upside-down US flag was raised by his wife. Additionally, an \u201cAppeal to Heaven\u201d flag was seen on display at his vacation property last summer, according to reports.

Walgreens announced Wednesday that it is cutting prices on 1,500 items \u2014 joining competitors including Target, Walmart and Amazon that also recently lowered prices on thousands of household goods. Industry experts say that US households aren\u2019t shopping like they used to, and high prices are forcing Americans to choose between wants and needs. Some retail chains have been forced to declare bankruptcy and shutter their doors as a result. One example is 99 Cents Only, which filed for bankruptcy in April and closed all of its 370 locations.

And in all likelihood, for the first time ever a woman will be chosen president.\n\nMexicans abroad in Southern California and elsewhere will have a say. They will be able to vote at Mexican consulates, such as the ones in downtown Los Angeles, Santa Ana and San Bernardino.\n\n\"I think this election is going to be the most historic of all,\" said Francisco Moreno Castillo, executive director of the Council of Mexican Federations in North America.\n\nThe two leading candidates are women: Claudia Sheinbaum, who is backed by current president Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador. And the opposition candidate is X\u00f3chitl G\u00e1lvez. The third candidate is Jorge \u00c1lvarez M\u00e1ynez.\n\nThis will be the first year that eligible Mexican citizens can vote in a presidential election in person outside of Mexico.\n\n\"We are really happy more people are getting involved in Mexican democracy,\" Moreno said.\n\nMoreno's nonprofit COFEM organization helped lead efforts to give Mexicans living abroad the opportunity to vote. In the early 2000s they even drove people to Tijuana and back.\n\n\"The growth has been exponential,\" Moreno said. \"We have now thousands and thousands of new voters.\"\n\nMexicans abroad can now vote online, by mail and in person.\n\nMexico's National Electoral Institute (INE) says voter turnout outside of Mexico has increased from roughly 32,000 in the 2006 presidential election to an estimated more than 200,000 this year.\n\nLeobardo Mendoza with the INE says offering in-person options strengthens communication and ties with Mexico for those living abroad and offers a way for them to exercise their right to vote.\n\nCOFEM has partnered with the INE to conduct outreach in local communities. Moreno said a historical indifference to politics in Mexico does impact voter turnout. But he says the state of politics is changing and underscores the role of the youngest generation of voters, including those who are binational.\n\n\"I'm happy to see that my kids, my daughter - she's really strong and wants to vote here and wants to vote there because we want peace in the world, we want to have better communities.\"",

        "text": "Breaking down the 2024 US presidential election campaign funds\nIn the U.S. presidential race, President Joe Biden has consistently been outpacing challenger Donald Trump in campaign fundraising, but that changed recently with the Trump campaign\u2019s record haul.\n\nIn April, Trump raised more money than Biden for the first time. Trump pulled in more than $50 million at a donor event in Palm Beach, Florida, in the beginning of the month, Reuters reported.\n\nGenerally, campaigns raise money from committees directly affiliated with a political party and individuals. The Federal Election Campaign Act limits how much money political organizations and individuals can contribute to each election.\n\nCandidates must report who has donated, how much money each entity has contributed, and where the funds are being spent. The Federal Election Commission (FEC) regulates funding by maintaining a database of campaign finances.\n\nCampaign spending, on the other hand, is unlimited.\n\n\"There\u2019s no limits on political spending in the United States. So under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, as interpreted by the Supreme Court, you can\u2019t tell any group, any individual for that matter, how much they could spend in politics. This means there\u2019s no laws that limit political spending,\" said Ray La Raja, a political science professor at the University of Massachusetts, in a briefing with the State Department.\n\nThe following breakdown looks at the campaign finances for Biden and Trump during the 2024 election campaign season.\n\nFinancial fundraising summaries\n\nBiden\u2019s FEC financial summary for the 2024 election, with data that spans January 1, 2021, until April 30, 2024, includes nearly $195 million in receipts. Donald Trump\u2019s financial summary, which includes data from November 15, 2022, until April 30, 2024, has just more than $124 million in receipts.\n\nBiden has notably outranked Trump in contributions from individuals in the financial summaries. Biden has received $71 million from individuals, while Trump has raised $1 million in individual contributions.\n\nHowever, Trump has seen larger support in contributions from committees other than the party committee directly affiliated with the political party. While Biden has received just more than $60,000 in contributions from other committees, Trump has received more than $200,000 from other committees, more than tripling what Biden has received.\n\nA further breakdown of the data shows differences between the two candidates\u2019 authorized committees, where each presidential candidate must authorize a specific campaign committee to take contributions and make expenses for the candidate. Biden has authorized the Biden for President committee; Trump has designated Donald J. Trump for President 2024, Inc. The authorized committee\u2019s fundraising efforts make up most of the financial summaries.\n\nThe Biden for President committee, which has been fundraising from January 1, 2023, to April 30, 2024, has raised a total of more than $180 million. Donald J. Trump for President 2024, Inc., has raised a total of about $120 million from January 1, 2023, to April 30, 2024.\n\nCampaign expenditures\n\nAlong with campaign fundraising come campaign expenses. Since January 1, 2023, Biden has outspent Trump. Biden has accumulated almost $100 million in disbursements, while Trump has spent almost $75 million.\n\nThe money goes to a variety of causes. The Trump committee\u2019s weightiest expenses include media creation, legal consultation and postage. Some of the recent expenses include ground transportation, such as Uber rides.\n\nThe most expensive items in the Biden committee\u2019s financial footprint look similar. The committee\u2019s top 10 expenses go to media production and digital consulting. Most recently, the committee has been allocating contribution refunds.\n\nWith the balance of fundraising and spending, each candidate has some money left in the bank for future endeavors. Biden, with $84 million cash in hand, outstrips Trump, who has $49 million.\n\nWhile Biden has generally outperformed Trump in fundraising thus far, both candidates are hitting the campaign trail this summer, hoping to rake in more money before the fall election.",

        "text": "What\u2019s next for Donald Trump after hush money conviction?\nHere\u2019s how Trump\u2019s hush money conviction can affect the US election in November 2024.\n\nFormer US President Donald Trump has been convicted of falsifying records to cover a hush money payment made to adult film star Stormy Daniels leading up to the 2016 United States presidential election.\n\nThis decision makes Trump the first president in the history of the United States to be convicted of criminal charges.\n\nHere is what we know so far:\n\nWhat was Trump found guilty of?\n\nAfter seven weeks of trial, shortly after 5pm local time (21:00 GMT) on Thursday, a New York City jury unanimously found him guilty on all 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in the first degree.\n\nDaniels claimed that ahead of the 2016 election that Trump eventually won, he paid her $130,000 to remain silent on a sexual encounter the two had a decade earlier. Trump denies the affair.\n\nTrump\u2019s former lawyer Michael Cohen made the payment, and testified that he acted under Trump\u2019s direct orders. Cohen insists Trump paid him back, using money collected for his election campaign.\n\nThe 34 charges relate to the different ways in which Trump categorised this hush money as legal fees in his records, which, according to the court included:\n\nEleven invoices for legal services\n\nEleven cheques paid for legal services\n\nTwelve ledger entries for legal expenses\n\nWill Trump go to prison?\n\nIt is unlikely that Trump will go to jail, although it is technically possible.\n\nWhile paying hush money in itself is not illegal, each count of falsification carries a sentence ranging from one year to a maximum of four years. So, in theory, Trump could face up to a total of 136 years in prison.\n\nBut in practice, it is uncommon for people who are only convicted of falsification of business records and have no other criminal history to be sentenced to prison in New York. Instead, punishments such as probation, fines or community service are more common.\n\nEven those who are sentenced to jail over falsification convictions typically serve a year or less in prison, and that too, usually, if they are also convicted of other crimes such as fraud or grand larceny \u2013 which is not the case with Trump.\n\nWhen will sentencing take place?\n\nAt the end of Thursday\u2019s proceedings, sentencing was set for 10am (14:00 GMT) on July 11, at the request of defence lawyer Todd Blanche.\n\nTrump will return to court for his sentencing hearing.\n\nIt falls four days before Trump is expected to be formally nominated as the party\u2019s presidential nominee at the Republican Party\u2019s national convention.\n\nCan Trump still run for president as a felon?\n\nYes, Trump can still run for US president in the November 2024 election.\n\nThe US Constitution requires that presidents are at least 35 years old and natural-born US citizens who have lived in the country for at least 14 years \u2013 Trump fulfils all criteria.\n\nIt does not bar convicts from running for or winning the presidency.\n\nCan Trump appeal the conviction?\n\nAfter Trump\u2019s conviction, his lawyer, Blanche, asked Judge Juan Merchan to dismiss the guilty verdict. But Merchan swiftly rejected the routine, pro forma request.\n\nHowever, after sentencing, Trump can challenge his conviction in a New York appellate court and possibly the Court of Appeals. His lawyers are already believed to be laying the groundwork for potential arguments, including:\n\nHe can accuse the judge of bias, arguing that the judge\u2019s daughter leads a firm with several Democrats as clients, including President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nHe can argue Judge Merchan made legal errors, including in allowing jurors to hear Daniels\u2019 salacious testimony.\n\nBlanche argued Daniels\u2019 description of a power imbalance with the older, taller Trump, was a \u201cdog whistle for rape,\u201d irrelevant to the case.\n\nTrump can argue that the charges themselves were legally improper. Falsification alone is a misdemeanour in New York but is elevated to a felony when done to help commit or conceal another crime. In this case, the other crime, according to the prosecution, was a conspiracy to violate a state election law. However, Trump\u2019s lawyers can argue that since he was contesting a federal election, state election laws don\u2019t apply to him, and so he should have been charged with a misdemeanour, not a felony.\n\nHow could this affect the US election?\n\nAccording to a poll released on May 30 by NPR, PBS NewsHour and Marist, 67 percent of respondents said their vote in November would not be affected if Trump were found guilty.\n\nFormer prosecutor and government ethics expert Melanie Sloan told Al Jazeera the guilty verdict would likely drive a wedge between Trump and more moderate constituencies, however.\n\nA poll conducted by Bloomberg and Morning Consult in January showed that 53 percent of voters in key swing states would refuse to vote for Trump if he were convicted.\n\nTrump\u2019s election campaign began to bank on the conviction before the guilty verdict was even released: his campaign fired off fundraising appeals, sent text messages deeming him a political prisoner and started selling black coloured \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d caps to mark a \u201cdark day in history\u201d.\n\nTrump will hold a news conference on Friday at Trump Tower as part of his campaign for the US presidential election.\n\nTrump\u2019s daughter-in-law and co-chair of the Republican National Committee Lara Trump told Fox News on Thursday that Trump would conduct campaign events and rallies online in case he is convicted and sentenced to home confinement.\n\nHow did Trump react?\n\nAs Trump left the court, he suggested without evidence that the conviction was orchestrated by Biden\u2019s administration.\n\n\u201cOur whole country is being rigged right now,\u201d he told reporters as he left the court.\n\nHow did other observers react?\n\nTrump\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump posted a childhood photo with her father on her Instagram story on Thursday, captioning it \u201cI love you dad\u201d. Ivanka and Trump\u2019s wife Melania Trump have largely remained silent during the trial.\n\nDemocratic President Biden, who is set to face Trump in the November election, posted an election fundraiser on his X account on Thursday, writing, \u201cThere\u2019s only one way to keep Donald Trump out of the Oval Office: At the ballot box.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s only one way to keep Donald Trump out of the Oval Office: At the ballot box. Donate to our campaign today: https://t.co/aJXS9oti0a \u2014 Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) May 30, 2024\n\nTrump\u2019s claim that the conviction was politically motivated was echoed by Republican lawmakers.\n\nThese included House Speaker Mike Johnson, who wrote \u201cToday is a shameful day in American history\u201d in an X post on Thursday. \u201cThe weaponization of our justice system has been a hallmark of the Biden Administration.\u201d\n\nMy statement on President Trump trial verdict: Today is a shameful day in American history. Democrats cheered as they convicted the leader of the opposing party on ridiculous charges, predicated on the testimony of a disbarred, convicted felon. This was a purely political\u2026 \u2014 Speaker Mike Johnson (@SpeakerJohnson) May 30, 2024\n\nHowever, the former Republican governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, wrote on X ahead of the verdict that Americans should \u201crespect the verdict and the legal process\u201d.\n\nRegardless of the result, I urge all Americans to respect the verdict and the legal process. At this dangerously divided moment in our history, all leaders\u2014regardless of party\u2014must not pour fuel on the fire with more toxic partisanship. We must reaffirm what has made this nation\u2026 \u2014 Governor Larry Hogan (@GovLarryHogan) May 30, 2024\n\nDemocratic California Representative Adam Schiff wrote on X on Thursday, \u201cDespite his efforts to distract, delay, and deny \u2013 justice arrived for Donald Trump all the same.\u201d",

All candidates ultimately must be approved by Iran\u2019s 12-member Guardian Council, a panel of clerics and jurists ultimately overseen by Khamenei. That panel has never accepted a woman, for instance, nor anyone calling for radical change within the country\u2019s governance.\n\nAhmad Vahidi, Iran\u2019s interior minister, opened the registration period. The Interior Ministry, in charge of the country\u2019s police, run Iranian elections with no substantial international observation.\n\n\u201cThese elections, like the parliamentary elections, will be held in complete safety and health, with good competition and wide participation of all dear people,\u201d Vahidi said.\n\nRaisi, a protege of Khamenei, won Iran\u2019s 2021 presidential election after the Guardian Council disqualified all of the candidates with the best chance to potentially challenge him. That vote saw the lowest turnout in Iran\u2019s history for a presidential election. This year\u2019s parliamentary vote saw an even-lower turnout amid widespread boycott calls.\n\nThat likely was a sign of voters\u2019 discontent with both a hard-line cleric sanctioned by the U.S. in part over his involvement in mass executions in 1988, and Iran\u2019s Shiite theocracy over four decades after its 1979 Islamic Revolution.\n\nWho will run \u2014 and potentially be accepted \u2014 remains in question. The country\u2019s acting president, Mohammad Mokhber, a previously behind-the-scenes bureaucrat, could be a front-runner, because he\u2019s already been seen in meetings with Khamenei. Also discussed as possible aspirants are former hard-line President Mohammad Ahmadinejad and former reformist President Mohammad Khatami \u2014 but whether they\u2019d be allowed to run is another question.\n\nAmong those registering Thursday was Saeed Jalili, a former Iranian nuclear negotiator who ran in 2013 and registered in 2021 before withdrawing to support Raisi.\n\n\u201cToday, we are in a historic opportunity,\u201d Jalili told journalists. \u201cIf we miss this, we will fall behind the path of progress.\u201d\n\nThe five-day registration period will close on Tuesday. The Guardian Council is expected to issue its final list of candidates within 10 days afterwards. That will allow for a shortened two-week campaign before the vote in late June.\n\nThe new president will take office while the country now enriches uranium at nearly weapons-grade levels and hampers international inspections. Iran has armed Russia in its war on Ukraine, as well as launched a drone and missile attack on Israel amid the war in Gaza. Tehran also has continued arming proxy groups in the Middle East, like Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels and Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah militia.\n\nMeanwhile, Iran\u2019s economy has faced years of hardship over its collapsing rial currency. Widespread protests have swept the country, most recently over Amini\u2019s death following her arrest over allegedly not wearing her mandatory headscarf to the liking of authorities, A U.N. panel says the Iranian government is responsible for the \u201cphysical violence\u201d that led to Amini\u2019s death.\n\nRaisi is just the second Iranian president to die in office. In 1981, a bomb blast killed President Mohammad Ali Rajai in the chaotic days after the Islamic Revolution.\n\n___\n\nAmir Vahdat contributed to this report from Tehran.",

        "text": "Analysis: Trump conviction heralds a somber and volatile moment in American history\nCNN \u2014\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s first act on becoming a convicted criminal was to launch a raging new attack on the rule of law, laying bare the gravity of the choice awaiting America\u2019s voters.\n\nIn one sense, Trump\u2019s conviction on all counts in his first criminal trial affirmed the principle on which the United States is founded \u2014 that everyone is equal and that no one, not even a billionaire and former and possibly future president, enjoys impunity.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s authoritarian outburst minutes after the guilty verdict in New York and a race by top Republicans to join his assault on the justice system underscore how threatened those bedrock values now are.\n\n\u201cThis was a rigged, disgraceful trial. The real verdict is going to be November 5, by the people, and they know what happened here and everybody knows what happened here,\u201d Trump said minutes after a jury foreperson announced he was guilty on 34 felony charges of falsifying business records to hide a hush money payment to an adult film star. After returning to Trump Tower and greeting supporters with a clenched fist, Trump issued a written statement that made clear that he views his own fate and the nation\u2019s as indistinguishable \u2014 a familiar hallmark of a dictatorial leader. \u201cI\u2019m a very innocent man, and it\u2019s okay, I\u2019m fighting for our country. I\u2019m fighting for our Constitution. Our whole country is being rigged right now,\u201d Trump wrote.\n\nPresident Joe Biden\u2019s campaign echoed his opponent\u2019s belief that the ultimate judgment on the former president will come in the general election.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s verdict does not change the fact that the American people face a simple reality,\u201d said campaign communications director Michael Tyler. \u201cThere is still only one way to keep Donald Trump out of the Oval Office: at the ballot box. Convicted felon or not, Trump will be the Republican nominee for president,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cThe threat Trump poses to our democracy has never been greater.\u201d\n\nA moment of personal anguish with national consequences\n\nTrump\u2019s conviction by a unanimous New York jury was the most painful low of a tumultuous life of denying accountability that has seen financial boom and bust, three marriages, television stardom, frequent brushes with the law, the triumph of his outsider 2016 election win, a norm-shattering presidency and an attempt to destroy democracy to stay in power after losing in 2020.\n\nJudging by his red-faced shock outside the courtroom, the verdict was a moment of personal anguish. Given that he\u2019s got a good chance of being the next president, it is sure to become a grave national test as well.\n\nTrump had pleaded not guilty in a trial that is one of four criminal cases entangled with the 2024 presidential election and the only one likely to see a jury before the election. Responses to any motions from the defense in the hush money case are due by June 27 \u2014 the day of the first presidential debate, hosted by CNN. Trump\u2019s sentencing hearing is set for July 11, just days before he\u2019ll secure the nomination at the Republican National Convention and around when he\u2019s said he\u2019d announce his vice presidential pick. Already, his legal defenses have morphed with his political strategy in a narrative of political persecution, and he is vowing that he will devote a possible second term to \u201cretribution\u201d against his foes.\n\nAmong an electorate that Trump has constantly polarized, the verdict is likely to be greeted with fury by his supporters and jubilation by his critics. But in truth, this is a somber and even tragic passage of US history. Americans have never seen an ex-president convicted of a crime, and a country already torn apart by bitter political and cultural polarization is likely in for a rocky time.\n\nThe implications are enormous.\n\nThey begin with the potential consequences for an election in five months that could be decided by the shift of just a few thousand votes in a few states. Trump has been preparing voters for months for the possibility that he would be found guilty in a case that prosecutors said centered around a bid to mislead voters in 2016. He\u2019s claimed his four criminal indictments are a plot by Biden to destroy him. In essence, he\u2019s been working to shatter his greatest norm yet \u2014 the idea that it would be unthinkable for a felon to serve as president.\n\nSupporters hold placards and flags following the announcement of the verdict in Trump's criminal trial. Andrew Kelly/Reuters\n\nNo one can know how voters will react to Trump\u2019s latest moment of ignominy. His conviction will certainly energize his loyal base and his campaign will try to create a backlash to the verdict among more moderate voters. If they succeed, Thursday could come to be remembered as the day Biden lost the election.\n\nOr, the guilty verdict could play into Biden\u2019s campaign theme that his predecessor is too corrupt and extreme to serve as president again. Moderate and suburban voters whom Trump has always struggled to attract could be further alienated.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s tactics and his capacity to shape the views of his supporters \u2014 with the aid of the conservative media machine \u2014 will inevitably mean that the legal system will join the electoral system as another essential institution of American governance that is now viewed as illegitimate by millions of citizens.\n\nAnd if it is Trump who raises his hand to swear to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution on January 20 as the 47th president, America will be led by a criminal whose duties will include being the symbolic head of the justice system. The danger is acute because with his attempt to stay in power after losing the 2020 election, Trump has already shown he will do what it takes to save himself, even if his actions catastrophically hurt democratic institutions.\n\nProfound reverberations of the Trump trial verdict\n\nCNN presidential historian Timothy Naftali said Thursday that Trump\u2019s call to arms for a campaign against the legal system will mean that every Republican will be forced to put it at the center of their 2024 campaigns. \u201cThat is going to create, in my view, a torrent of poison that will be likely worse than we saw in the \u2018Stop the Steal\u2019 campaign that preceded January 6. And that is going to further unsettle an already sensitive country,\u201d Naftali said. \u201cI worry about it because the \u2018Stop the Steal\u2019 campaign created widespread doubt about the honesty of our electoral system and led many people to believe that fraud had been committed in 2020.\u201d\n\nA question that long hovered over this trial is whether the crime \u2014 falsifying financial records to hide a hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels to mislead voters in 2016 \u2014 was sufficiently serious for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg to risk the extraordinary political consequences of indicting an ex-president. Prosecutors\u2019 use of Trump\u2019s former fixer Michael Cohen as their star witness, despite his own conviction on tax charges and for lying to Congress, was deeply controversial. Trump\u2019s lawyer Todd Blanche told CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins Thursday that the timing of the trial \u2014 in the middle of an election campaign \u2014 was unfair to the ex-president.\n\nBut the charges were not just cooked up by prosecutors as Trump claimed. They were brought by a grand jury. The ex-president was offered the presumption of innocence until proven guilty, and he was judged by a jury of his peers. Even now, the Constitution he claims has been hijacked will protect him with a full array of appeals, as in all of his other criminal cases.\n\nBut once a jury has delivered a verdict, justice is considered served. So the immediate Republican attacks on the judge, the court and the verdict represent an extraordinary effort by one of the country\u2019s two major political parties to turn against the integrity of the legal system.\n\nEric Trump listens as former President Donald Trump speaks to the media after being found guilty on all 34 counts in his hush money trial at Manhattan Criminal Court on May 30, 2024. Justin Lane/Pool/Getty Images\n\nThe GOP is showing \u2014 after failing to convict Trump in two impeachments and after many of its most prominent members repeated his lies about the 2020 election \u2014 that there is nothing that he can do that will sever the party\u2019s cult-like embrace of its leader. This suggests that any Trump second term would feature even fewer constraints than his wild first one. And it raises questions about his claim to be running a \u201claw and order\u201d campaign.\n\nOne of the first Republicans to react was New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, the House GOP conference chair who is seen as a possible Trump vice presidential pick. \u201cToday\u2019s verdict shows how corrupt, rigged, and un-American the weaponized justice system has become under Joe Biden and Democrats,\u201d Stefanik said. \u201cFrom the start, the weaponized scales of justice were stacked against President Trump.\u201d\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, who traveled to support Trump during his trial and helped to fuel false claims of electoral fraud in 2020, brought the symbolic weight of his office to support Trump and attack the legal system. \u201cToday is a shameful day in American history. Democrats cheered as they convicted the leader of the opposing party on ridiculous charges, predicated on the testimony of a disbarred, convicted felon. This was a purely political exercise, not a legal one,\u201d the Louisiana Republican claimed.\n\nAnother top Trump ally, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, said there was never a chance of a fair trial in a city which drew its jury pool from one of the most liberal areas in America. \u201cThis verdict says more about the system than the allegations. It will be seen as politically motivated and unfair, and it will backfire tremendously on the political Left,\u201d Graham said. \u201cThis is a mockery of justice.\u201d\n\nGraham\u2019s comment promoted an idea that\u2019s taken hold among conservatives that a Republican leader can only get a fair trial if they are judged in a jurisdiction where they are popular \u2014 a proposition that would effectively permanently politicize justice.\n\nOne Republican who refused to join the rush to trash the verdict is former \ufeffMaryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who\u2019s running for Senate. \u201cAt this dangerously divided moment in our history, all leaders\u2014regardless of party\u2014must not pour fuel on the fire with more toxic partisanship,\u201d Hogan said in a statement ahead of the verdict being announced. Chris LaCivita, a senior adviser to Trump\u2019s campaign wrote on X: \u201cYou just ended your campaign.\u201d\n\nHogan\u2019s comment would once have been a standard Republican reaction to the conviction of a top-level politician. In another age, a guilty verdict would have immediately ended Trump\u2019s campaign. The fact that the newly convicted criminal is already using it as a springboard to power speaks to volatile days ahead.\n\n\u201cThis verdict shows two different things,\u201d Naftali said.\n\n\u201cThe first is that the former president can be indicted and found guilty by a group of his peers. And that shows the strength of our system. The other verdict, though, hasn\u2019t come in and the other verdict is, can the powerful use our political system to escape the consequences of being found guilty? And that verdict is in November.\u201d",

        "text": "Can Donald Trump still become US President? | Explainer\nPublished : May 31, 2024 16:30 IST - 5 MINS READ\n\nDonald Trump, the presumptive Republican Party nominee for the November 2024 US presidential election, is no stranger to the courtroom. In January 2024, a jury in New York ruled that he would have to pay writer E. Jean Carroll millions of dollars in damages for sexually abusing and then defaming her, a decision that Trump is appealing. That was a civil case.\n\nNow, Trump has become the first former US President to be convicted of criminal charges. The case centred on whether he paid hush money to bury stories about an alleged extramarital sexual encounter with a porn star to protect his 2016 campaign for the White House.\n\nIt was the first of four criminal trials\u2014two State and two federal\u2014that Trump has coming up. The other State case centres on alleged attempts to overturn his loss in Georgia in the 2020 presidential election; one federal case charges that he knowingly pushed election fraud lies in 2020 to try to stay in power; and another charges that he illegally retained classified government documents when he left the White House, a violation of the Presidential Records Act.\n\nCan Donald Trump still run for President?\n\nYes. No matter how any of these cases end, Trump will still be able to run for President. The US Constitution sets only three eligibility requirements for persons wanting the job: They must be a natural-born citizen of the United States, be at least 35 years old, and have resided in the US for at least 14 years. Nowhere does it say that a convicted criminal cannot run for or become President.\n\nAlso Read | Understanding the indictment of Donald Trump\n\n\u201cThere are several arguments over whether a presidential candidate who is indicted or is involved in an ongoing legal case should still run for office,\u201d Laura Merrifield Wilson, associate professor of political science at the University of Indianapolis, told DW in December 2023. \u201cBut those are based on morals, judgment, and preferences, not overt laws or procedural barriers.\u201d\n\nCould Trump be disqualified under the 14th Amendment to the US Constitution?\n\nSection 3 of the 14th Amendment to the US Constitution states that people who \u201cengaged in insurrection or rebellion\u201d after taking an oath to support the constitution are disqualified from holding \u201cany office, civil or military, under the United States.\u201d\n\nActivists who want Trump disqualified under this clause say the then-President\u2019s actions in the run-up to the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol constitute participation in an insurrection. They say his lies about how Democrats stole the election encouraged the right-wing mob that stormed the US Capitol that day.\n\nAttempts have been launched to have Trump removed from primary ballots in a number of States under this amendment, \u201cwhich was originally used to prevent secessionists from returning to their government positions after the American Civil War,\u201d explained former DW journalist Brandon Conradis, now a campaign editor with political news site The Hill.\n\nBut in March 2024, the Supreme Court struck down one such attempt in Colorado, saying States do not have the authority to bar individuals from running for federal office. The \u201cresponsibility for enforcing Section 3 against federal officeholders and candidates rests with Congress\u201d, wrote the Supreme Court in the opinion that accompanied its verdict. The decision thus voided similar attempts in other States.\n\nSince Congress is split, with Republicans holding the majority in the House of Representatives and Democrats having a one-seat majority in the Senate, it seems highly unlikely that Trump will be disqualified under the 14th Amendment.\n\nCould Trump vote in the US election?\n\nProbably not. Trump is registered to vote in Florida, where convicted felons are disenfranchised. \u201cMost felons in Florida regain voting rights after completing their full sentence, including parole or probation, and paying all fines and fees,\u201d politics reporter Maggie Astor wrote in The New York Times.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s parole would likely not be up in time for him to regain his right to vote. So, if convicted, Trump could still run for President, but not vote for himself.\n\nBut what happens if Trump actually has to go to prison?\n\nNo one knows. \u201cWe\u2019re so far removed from anything that\u2019s ever happened,\u201d Erwin Chemerinsky, a constitutional law expert at the University of California, Berkeley, told The New York Times. \u201cIt\u2019s just guessing.\u201d\n\nLegally, Trump would remain eligible to run, even from behind bars. But of course, a President who is elected while in prison would present a logistical challenge.\n\nAlso Read | White House race heats up with Joe Biden and Donald Trump all set for rematch\n\nJournalist Astor speculated that \u201cTrump could sue to be released on the basis that his imprisonment was preventing him from fulfilling his constitutional obligations as President\u201d. But again\u2015since nothing like this has ever happened in the course of US history\u2014it is impossible to say how things might play out.\n\nIf elected, could Trump dismiss the cases against him or pardon himself?\n\nIn theory, Trump could commute his prison sentence and leave his conviction in place, or even try to fully pardon himself, but these would be extreme assertions of presidential power that would likely go before the Supreme Court (where conservative justices hold a 6-3 majority) to be vetted for their constitutionality.\n\nAlternatively, President Joe Biden could pardon a victorious Trump on his way out the door so that the man elected by US voters could govern the country. Such actions, however, would only apply to Trump\u2019s federal cases, not the New York State hush money trial, nor the Georgia election interference case, as Presidents do not have the power to grant pardons for State convictions.",

        "text": "Could Trump go to prison? 5 quick questions about his conviction\nFor the first time in U.S. history, a former president has been convicted of a felony. A New York jury on Thursday found former President Donald Trump guilty on all 34 counts of falsifying business records related to the payment of hush money.\n\nWATCH: A day after hush money conviction, Trump claims verdict is illegitimate\n\nTrump called the verdict illegitimate in a news conference on Friday, and attacked the judge in the case. He also took aim at President Joe Biden, his Democratic opponent in his bid for reelection to the Oval Office.\n\nTrump\u2019s conviction poses a unique scenario for the 2024 presidential race and raises questions like whether he will even be able to vote. His sentencing is set for July, days before the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, where he\u2019s expected to formally accept his party\u2019s presidential nomination.\n\nHere are five quick questions about what happens now.\n\nCan Trump still run for president?\n\nYes.\n\nThe Constitution doesn\u2019t prohibit people convicted of a felony from serving as president. (It does disqualify people convicted on insurrection charges). The RNC rules for this year\u2019s conventions do not include any restrictions on voting for candidates who are convicted of a felony.\n\nCould Trump go to prison?\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely, but not impossible.\n\nSentencing is at the judge\u2019s discretion. While jail is an option, it\u2019s not usually assigned for this type of crime in Manhattan, legal experts and former prosecutors point out, especially for first-time offenders. Each count of falsifying business records carries a maximum of four years in prison. Trump was convicted on 34 counts. Lighter punishments, like probation, could also be on the table.\n\nWATCH: Former federal prosecutors break down Trump\u2019s trial and historic conviction\n\nCan Trump vote in the 2024 election?\n\nMaybe.\n\nTrump can vote for himself in November\u2019s election if he isn\u2019t in prison on Election Day.\n\nTrump is a resident of in Florida, which uses the rules in the person\u2019s state of conviction to determine voting rights. Trump was convicted in New York, where people convicted of felonies only lose the right to vote while they\u2019re incarcerated. When they\u2019re released, voting rights are restored.\n\nCould Trump pardon himself?\n\nNo.\n\nThe hush money trial was concerned with state-level crimes. Presidential pardons only cover federal criminal offenses. In New York, where Trump was convicted, the governor could pardon him, but it\u2019s unlikely that Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul would.\n\nWATCH: Trump found guilty in hush money trial. What happens now?\n\nWhat happens now?\n\nTrump\u2019s sentencing is scheduled for July 11.\n\nThat\u2019s just days before the Republican National Convention begins in Milwaukee. A lengthy appeals process is expected to follow.\n\nTrump also faces three other criminal cases, though it\u2019s unlikely if any of them will reach a jury before Election Day.",

This includes the ability to cast a ballot in secure and transparent elections. While stationed abroad, it is imperative that their voices carry the same weight as those of domestic voters. Together, the Federal Voting Assistance Program (FVAP) and the EAC work to ensure that service members are aware of their right to vote no matter where they are in the world. Our agencies help military voters participate fully in U.S. elections and support election officials as they serve these voters.\n\nWe understand the unique challenges election officials face when serving military and overseas voters. During the last presidential general election over 528,000 military voters were registered to vote and we anticipate that number will be higher this presidential election year. The more resources and data available to support election officials, the better the voting process will be for military and overseas voters.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, FVAP issued the following statement:\n\n\u201cThe Department of Defense\u2019s Federal Voting Assistance Program recognizes the importance of those who serve \u2013 or have served- in the U.S. Armed Forces and appreciates the U.S. Election Assistance Commission for providing state and local election officials information about processing absentee ballot applications and voted ballots.\u201d\n\nThe agencies recently partnered on a Fact Sheet and a Pocket Guide to help election officials serve UOCAVA voters. These are part of the EAC\u2019s growing library of resources for election officials.\n\nUOCAVA outlines special voting procedures for two categories of voters: members of the uniformed services absent from their voting residence and their eligible family members, and U.S. citizens living overseas. FVAP maintains a Voting Assistance Guide to ensure these voters have the tools and resources to be able to vote in all 55 States, territories, and the District of Columbia.\n\nMore information is available at fvap.gov and eac.gov/uocava.\n\n###\n\nThe U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) was established by the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA). It is an independent, bipartisan commission charged with ensuring secure, accurate, and accessible elections by developing guidance to meet HAVA requirements, adopting voluntary voting system guidelines, and serving as a national clearinghouse of information on election administration. The EAC also accredits testing laboratories and certifies voting systems, as well as administers the use of HAVA funds. For more information, visit www.eac.gov.",

Please contribute now and support our work.\n\nTHIS WEEK IN BRIEF:\n\nAfter failing twice to enact such a measure through legislation, the Biden administration appears poised to issue an executive order that would allow U.S. border authorities to turn back or deport asylum seekers whenever the number of arriving migrants exceeds a specific threshold. The legal authority on which such an executive order would be based appears shaky, and there is a significant probability that it would not withstand challenges in the judicial system.\n\nMexico\u2019s government reported encountering or stopping 120,879 migrants during the month of April, a record that only slightly exceeds similar numbers reported every month since January. Well over half of April\u2019s total were citizens of South American nations. Mexico\u2019s stepped-up efforts to block migrants, which appear to involve aggressive busing into the country\u2019s interior more than deportations or detentions, have left large numbers of migrants stranded there amid a notable drop in U.S. authorities\u2019 migrant encounters.\n\nThe U.S. Border Patrol was founded 100 years ago this week. Some analyses of the milestone have focused on the agency\u2019s checkered human rights record. The Southern Border Communities Coalition and congressional Democrats, drawing attention to a recent GAO report\u2019s findings, voiced concern that reforms aimed at more impartial oversight of use-of-force cases aren\u2019t going far enough.\n\nColombia voices skepticism about Panama\u2019s new president\u2019s promise to shut down Dari\u00e9n Gap migration. UNHCR data continue to show that many Venezuelan migrants in the Dari\u00e9n first sought to settle elsewhere in South America. Ecuadorians are skipping the Dari\u00e9n route by flying to El Salvador.\n\nTHE FULL UPDATE:\n\nAn executive order limiting asylum access could come as early as next week\n\nThe Biden administration appears close to issuing an executive action that, when daily migration exceeds a certain level, would deny or severely limit the right to seek asylum for migrants apprehended on the U.S. side of the border with Mexico. Reports are converging on Tuesday (June 4) as a likely release date, though they caution that it continues to be a matter of internal White House discussion.\n\nThis \u201casylum shutdown\u201d order would U.S. authorities to deport asylum seekers without affording them a chance to seek protection, perhaps making exceptions for those who can prove a very high threshold of fear of return. It would reportedly be triggered when U.S. authorities\u2019 daily average of migrant encounters reaches 4,000 or 5,000, possibly including appointments made at ports of entry. Where possible, U.S. border authorities would deport migrants to Mexico after denying asylum access.\n\nAt busy moments along the border, then, the executive order would institute a policy similar to the pandemic-era Title 42 expulsions regime.\n\nAs part of a larger package of border-related measures, leadership of the U.S. Senate\u2019s Democratic majority tried twice this year, without success, to add such an \u201casylum shutdown\u201d authority to U.S. law on a temporary basis. (See WOLA\u2019s February 9 and May 24 Border Updates, among others in the past six months.)\n\nWithout that law authorizing it, it is not clear how the Biden administration could use executive authority to abridge asylum at the border in this way. If President Biden \u201cwere to try to shut down portions of the border, the courts would throw that out, I think, within a matter of weeks,\u201d Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Connecticut), Senate Democrats\u2019 chief architect of the unsuccessful border legislation, told CBS News\u2019s Face the Nation.\n\nPress reports indicate that the administration may resort to using Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), which allows the President to bar the entry of a class of non-citizens considered \u201cdetrimental to the interests of the United States.\u201d However, courts have cast doubt on whether 212(f) can in fact be used to remove an asylum seeker already on U.S. soil and asking for protection. Section 208 of the INA allows non-citizens to ask for asylum if they are \u201cphysically present\u201d in the United States, regardless of how they arrived. (The Trump and Biden administrations\u2019 Title 42 policy did allow expulsions of asylum seekers on public health grounds; federal courts did not agree with this but the policy expired before all appeals were exhausted.)\n\nEarlier reporting, as WOLA\u2019s May 24 Border Update reported, was already pointing to the White House issuing the order soon, after Mexico\u2019s June 2 presidential elections. \u201cThe White House and a White House official told me that no final decisions have been made about an executive action that is potentially being considered,\u201d reported PBS NewsHour\u2019s Laura Barron-Lopez on May 28. \u201cBut sources told me that this specific executive action could come as early as next week after the Mexican elections on June 2.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cMexican elections\u201d milestone is no accident, as executing the order would depend on Mexico taking more U.S. returns of non-Mexican citizens. Mexico currently accepts U.S. deportations of up to 30,000 citizens of Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela every month under a May 2023 Biden administration rule, currently facing judicial challenges, that denies asylum to migrants who cross the border between ports of entry without having sought it elsewhere along their migration route.\n\nMexico\u2019s recent cooperation extends to a big jump in migrant apprehensions and other stepped-up efforts to block routes to the U.S. border this year, as discussed in the next section below. It is not clear, though, whether Mexico\u2019s government\u2014which strongly opposed a restart of the Trump-era \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d policy\u2014would agree to take back a greater number of U.S. cross-border deportees under a new executive order. (U.S. aerial deportation, a costly program, is meanwhile unlikely to expand dramatically.)\n\nAdministration officials and some centrist Democrats continue calling for new limits on asylum. \u201cThe reality is that some people do indeed try to game the [asylum] system,\u201d Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told CBS News in an interview that aired May 28. \u201cThat does not speak to everyone whom we encounter, but there is an element of it, and we deal with it accordingly.\u201d A CNN analysis meanwhile noted how Democratic legislators and candidates in tight races tend to favor placing limits on asylum at the border.\n\nFor fourth straight month, Mexico encounters almost exactly 120,000 migrants\n\nA year ago, Mexico\u2019s authorities had never reported stopping (apprehending or \u201cencountering\u201d) more than 52,201 migrants in a month\u2014a record set in October 2022. By November 2023, Mexico had shattered that record, stopping 97,969 migrants.\n\nNow, Mexico has left even that record far behind. In April, for the fourth straight month, Mexico\u2019s Migration Policy Unit reported encountering almost exactly 120,000 migrants. The 481,025 migrants Mexico reports stopping or encountering between January and April represent a 231 percent increase over the same period in 2023.\n\nAs has been typical in recent months, about one-third of Mexico\u2019s April migrant encounters have been with citizens of Venezuela. In fact, the top three positions were South American nationalities: 10 percent were Ecuadorian and 8 percent were Colombian. Of all 120,879 of Mexico\u2019s April encounters, 57 percent were with migrants from the South American continent. 7 percent were from countries in Asia (4,362) or Africa (4,291).\n\nOf all nationalities with more than 1,000 April encounters, 3 have more than doubled in encounters since December 2023: Peru (+318%), Colombia (+217%), and El Salvador (+140%). El Salvador is the fastest-growing Central American nationality despite the reported popularity of its newly re-inaugurated president, Nayib Bukele.\n\nEven as Mexico\u2019s government reports encountering or stopping a record number of migrants, it has kept deportations to a minimum. It reported removing 1,779 migrants in April, 85 percent of them citizens of Guatemala and Honduras, and 10,427 so far this year (88% from Guatemala and Honduras). Mexico reports deporting one migrant for every 46 migrants encountered; in 2022 the ratio was one deportee for every 3.6 encounters.\n\nMexico has meanwhile all but ceased handing out humanitarian visitor cards (Tarjetas de Visitante por Razones Humanitarias or TVRH), a document that some migrants used in the past to travel to the U.S. border. The Migration Policy Unit reports that Mexico furnished 888 humanitarian cards in the first 4 months of the year, down 98 percent from 51,095 in the first 4 months of 2023.\n\nRecord encounters, along with minimal deportations and transit documents, indicate that Mexico probably has an unprecedented number of migrants in its territory. Media continue to report about the government\u2019s policy of busing large numbers of migrants, relocating them in the country\u2019s south and elsewhere in its interior, far from the U.S. border. It is unclear how long Mexico can keep this up, or how long migrants stranded in the country will tolerate it. But for now, it has brought a notable reduction in the number of people reaching the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nOn Border Patrol\u2019s 100th anniversary, advocates focus on oversight and accountability\n\nThe U.S. Border Patrol was founded 100 years ago this week, in 1924. Much coverage of the anniversary has focused on the agency\u2019s complicated history.\n\nThe force\u2019s current chief, Jason Owens, looked back on his career and told CBP\u2019s Frontline magazine website that people considering a career as an agent should fully commit to it as a \u201ccalling.\u201d Owens described tools using AI technology as a \u201cforce multiplier\u201d for agents in the field. He added, \u201cIt would be so much better if the migrants went to the port of entry.\u201d (CBP has capped port of entry capacity to receive asylum seekers at 1,450 people per day border-wide.)\n\nA Mother Jones analysis highlighted aspects of the agency\u2019s founding, at the urging of Texas Congressman Claude Benton Hudspeth, that reflect political and social tensions and contradictions about U.S. border security and immigration that remain in place today. \u201cChaos is not just the absence of a border; it is also the consequence of trying to maintain one,\u201d noted the piece\u2019s author, Tim Murphy.\n\n\u201cRevelations of some agents\u2019 racist vitriol toward migrants, along with allegations of sexual misconduct against women employees, have rocked public trust in recent years,\u201d noted a Christian Science Monitor analysis of Border Patrol\u2019s centennial.\n\nThe Southern Border Communities Coalition commemorated the anniversary with a press conference in San Diego with loved ones of people killed, wounded, or racially profiled by agency personnel, none of whom has paid a penalty. The Coalition voiced skepticism about whether recent reforms, like the abolition of \u201cCritical Incident Teams\u201d that interfered with past investigations, are enough to achieve justice when Border Patrol agents commit human rights abuses.\n\nThree San Diego-area House Democrats, along with Texas Rep. Joaqu\u00edn Castro, sent a letter to leadership of DHS and CBP with questions about oversight of Border Patrol in human rights cases. Castro and Reps. Juan Vargas, Sara Jacobs, and Scott Peters called on the border agencies to follow recommendations in a May 13 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report, which found that Border Patrol\u2019s Office of Professional Responsibility needed to improve the independence and impartiality of personnel investigating critical use-of-force incidents.\n\n4,281 Border Patrol agents left the agency between October 2020 and April 2024, an annual attrition rate of about 6 percent, according to data obtained through the Freedom of Information Act by Anna Giaritelli of the conservative Washington Examiner. As Border Patrol underwent a surge of hiring in the years after September 11, 2001, a large number of agents are completing 20 years on the force and will soon be eligible for retirement, Giaritelli noted.\n\nThe article cited unnamed agents blaming the Biden administration for low morale; many say morale is low because they must release many apprehended migrants instead of detaining them.\n\nSouth America migration updates\n\nColombia \u201cwould not agree with\u201d Panamanian President-Elect Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino\u2019s campaign promise to shut down the Dari\u00e9n Gap by deporting migrants who cross the treacherous jungle route straddling the two countries\u2019 border, said Foreign Minister Luis Gilberto Murillo. Instead, \u201cwhat we have to offer is more humanitarian outlets for this population that crosses through that area.\u201d The Colombian news site Cambio looked at the logistical, human rights, and practical obstacles that would stand in the way of \u201cshutting down\u201d the Dari\u00e9n.\n\nby deporting migrants who cross the treacherous jungle route straddling the two countries\u2019 border, said Foreign Minister Luis Gilberto Murillo.

The Ecuadorian daily Primicias reported on the increasing number of northbound Ecuadorian citizens who are avoiding the Dari\u00e9n Gap by flying to El Salvador , which does not require visas of visiting Ecuadorians. \u201cBetween January and April 2024, 43,408 travelers have left Ecuador [for El Salvador] and 4,112 have returned.\u201d While seeking to migrate northward after arriving, many are subject to bribery, shakedowns, and mistreatment by Salvadoran and other corrupt Central American officials.\n\n, which does not require visas of visiting Ecuadorians. \u201cBetween January and April 2024, 43,408 travelers have left Ecuador [for El Salvador] and 4,112 have returned.\u201d While seeking to migrate northward after arriving, many are subject to bribery, shakedowns, and mistreatment by Salvadoran and other corrupt Central American officials. Of 128 migrants transiting Panama interviewed by UNHCR earlier this month, 69 percent were from Venezuela, and of these, half came directly from Venezuela. Of the half of Venezuelans who had sought to live elsewhere in South America before migrating again, 60 percent had applied for legal status in those other countries, mainly Colombia, Peru, or Ecuador. Of all 128, 69 percent reported suffering physical insecurity (attacks, drownings, or falls) while crossing the Dari\u00e9n. 22 percent observed between 1 and 20 cadavers along the Dari\u00e9n trail .\n\n. About a quarter of people in Venezuela are considering migrating, but of those, 47 percent would stay if the opposition were somehow allowed to win the country\u2019s July 28 presidential elections, according to a Delphos poll reported by the Associated Press.\n\nOther news",

        "text": "Can a convicted felon vote in Florida? Here\u2019s what to know\nAfter yesterday's verdict, there was immediate questions as to whether Donald Trump will able to vote for himself, or in any election, in Florida.\n\nTrump was found guilty on all 34 counts in his New York criminal hush money trial, becoming the first former U.S. president convicted of a crime.\n\nTrump was convicted of falsifying business records to hide a hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 presidential election, USA TODAY reported. Prosecutors alleged Trump falsified the records to conceal unlawfully interfering in the 2016 presidential election through the $130,000 hush money payment, making the falsification charges felonies.\n\nThe crime carries a penalty of up to four years in prison, with sentencing scheduled for July 11. However, legal experts told USA Today they predict he is likely to get only probation or a shorter sentence.\n\nBut do felony charges actually prevent a person from voting in Florida? Here's what to know.\n\nWhat is a convicted felon?\n\nA felon is a person who has been convicted of a felony, such as grand theft, kidnapping, or murder.\n\nAccording to Florida's statutes, the term \u201cconvicted\u201d means, with respect to a person's felony offense, a determination of guilt which is the result of a trial or the entry of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, regardless of whether adjudication is withheld.\n\nCan a convicted felon vote in Florida?\n\nIn the state of Florida, convicted felons (not of moral turpitude crimes) will lose their right to vote until the following conditions are met:\n\nThey have completed your sentence, including probation, parole.\n\nFull payment of all restitution, fines, and other fees.\n\nYes, he would.\n\nU.S. Vote Foundation notes that a felony conviction in another state makes a person ineligible to vote in Florida only if the conviction would make the person ineligible to vote in the state where the person was convicted. Which would apply to Trump's case.\n\nTrump was found guilty in New York, and New York allows felons to vote as long as they are not actually behind bars. The former president has not yet been sentenced and has already promised to appeal, which could keep him out of any potential prison sentence for months or even years, well beyond the November election.\n\n\"Trump has neither been sentenced to incarceration nor is he actually incarcerated. He has the right to vote in New York, so he has it in Florida,\" Blair Bowie, attorney and director of the Campaign Legal Center's Restore Your Vote project, told USA TODAY. \"The only way he won't be able to vote is if he is actually in prison on Election Day.\"\n\nHow many states don't allow felons to vote? Which states do allow felons to vote?\n\nLike Florida, most states restrict the ability for people with felony convictions to vote until they either complete their sentences. Some states, such as Iowa, Virginia and Tennessee, require you to fill out an application to restore your voting rights.\n\nOut of all 50 states, Maine and Vermont are the only states that do not take away voting rights from convicted felons.\n\nWhat are the consequences of a felony conviction in Florida?\n\nIn addition to losing the right to vote, Florida law deprives convicted felons of certain Civil Rights including the right to serve on a jury, hold public office, and restricts the issuance and renewal of some professional licenses such as real estate and insurance.\n\nJust like with voting, they can apply to get these rights restored provided they have no outstanding criminal charges or outstanding monetary obligations as a result of their criminal conviction.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice also states that federal law forbids those with felony convictions or discharges from the Armed Forces under dishonorable conditions to possess firearms, ammunition, or explosives. This right will not be restored and penalty, if caught, is ten years imprisonment and/or a $250,000 fine.\n\nWhat are the types of felonies in Florida and their penalties?\n\nIn Florida, felonies are classified into 5 categories \u2014 capital, life, first-degree, second-degree, and third-degree felonies.\n\nBroward Law Team explains that first-degree felonies can result in a prison term of up to 30 years and a fine of not exceeding $10,000. Second-degree and third-degree felonies carry penalties of up to 15 and 5 years in prison, respectively, and fines not exceeding $10,000 and $5,000, respectively.\n\nOn the other hand, capital and life felonies are much more serious.\n\n\"Capital felonies are a serious issue, and among more serious crimes, these can result in the death penalty or life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. A capital felony is considered the most serious crime in Florida and often involves severe harm or loss of life,\" the team writes.\n\nLife felonies, meanwhile, are punishable by life imprisonment without the possibility of parole and a fine of up to $15,000.\n\nContributing: C.

Mexico\u2019s federal election on Sunday features three candidates for president \u2013 including two women . Dual nationality comes with double privilege but also creates double responsibility, expert says .",
        "text": "Dual nationality allows some to vote for presidents in Mexico, U.S.\nBy Veronica Martinez and Raul Flores / La Verdad\n\nCIUDAD JU\u00c1REZ \u2013 Hilda Sotelo was born in Mexico and became a naturalized citizen of the United States, giving her dual nationality.\n\n\u201cI am a cross-border person. I have lived in Ju\u00e1rez for years, I have family in Ju\u00e1rez and here in El Paso, too,\u201d said the university faculty member and writer. \u201cI know both languages, I have dual citizenship and lately I have been spending more time in the United States.\u201d\n\nSotelo said she has crossed the border from El Paso to Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez to cast her vote in Mexico every election year since 2012.\n\nThis year, her dual citizenship status will allow her to vote in presidential elections in both countries \u2013 Sunday, June 2, in Mexico\u2019s election and Tuesday, Nov. 5 in the United States.\n\nMexico\u2019s federal election on Sunday features three candidates for president \u2013 including two women: Claudia Sheinbaum of the Let\u2019s Keep Making History coalition (Regeneration Movement known as Morena party, Green party and Labor party); X\u00f3chitl G\u00e1lvez of the Strength and Heart Coalition (PAN, PRI and PRD parties); and Jorge \u00c1lvarez M\u00e1ynez of the Citizen Movement party. The election also includes races for senators, governors and mayors throughout the nation, including the Ju\u00e1rez mayoral seat.\n\nOn Nov. 5, U.S. voters will elect a president \u2013 selecting between Democrat incumbent Joe Biden and GOP candidate Donald Trump. Other races in the general election include U.S. and state senators and representatives; while El Paso ballots will include races for sheriff and district attorney.\n\nSotelo and thousands of others with dual nationality can influence the presidential elections on both sides of the border on everything from migration and immigration to economic development and foreign trade to safety and security.\n\nAmong them are siblings Alejandro Orquiz, 20, and Karime Orquiz, 23, who share the border dynamic of crossing the border regularly to visit family, study or work.\n\n\u201cIt is very important that we as young people start thinking about politics because the elections that we will have now will shape the future that we will live in later, and I want us to have better opportunities,\u201d Karime said.\n\nPresidential elections in Mexico and the United States coincide every 12 years: Mexican elections are held every six years, while U.S. elections are held every four years.\n\nWith both countries holding presidential races this year, the electoral process is even more politicized, said Victor Alejandro Espinoza, political science researcher and president of Colegio de la Frontera Norte.\n\n\u201cThose who are interested in what happens in the United States election are the same ones who are going to be interested in what happens in the Mexican election,\u201d Espinoza said.\n\n\u201cI think that interest will increase in some sectors because they are seeing that the relationship is important between both countries. For those in the United States or Mexico, the elections have an impact on life in both countries,\u201d he added.\n\nEspinoza said that there is little data on this population with dual nationality and it is still difficult to define its size and political impact. But, he said, it\u2019s comparable to the Mexican population that votes from abroad.\n\nDual nationality comes with double privilege but also creates double responsibility, he said.\n\n\u201cI am of the idea that democracies are made by exercising the vote. Politics is part of our daily lives and the citizens of both countries depend on all these decisions,\u201d said Sotelo, who has been involved in political movements of Mexican parties in El Paso.\n\nDual nationality, two votes\n\nMexicans have been allowed to have more than one nationality since 1998 under the Mexican Nationality Law.\n\nDual nationality along border communities is very high, Espinoza said, adding that some people have acquired it through the naturalization process or by being born in the United States and having at least one parent of Mexican nationality.\n\nThe U.S. Census reports that, in 2022, about 24.4 million people were born abroad and had citizenship through the naturalization process. Although these figures are not divided by nationality, it\u2019s estimated that 44% are of Hispanic or Latino origin.\n\nIn Mexico, figures from the National Institute of Statistics, Geography and Informatics, or INEGI, indicate that the majority of people residing in Mexico born in another country are from the United States. Baja California is the state with the most residents born in the United States followed by Chihuahua.\n\nThe government of Chihuahua reported that the Civil Registry Office issued more than 50,000 dual nationality certificates through the \u201cI am Mexico\u201d program from 2016 through 2021. In 2023, more than 15,000 certificates were issued.\n\n\n\nEspinoza and other political science researchers consider that the dual U.S.-Mexico citizenship population is similar and comparable to that of Mexicans who vote from abroad.\n\n\u201cMexicans of dual nationality who vote in the United States are the ones who also vote in the Mexican election. There is a degree of knowledge and conviction to participate in both elections,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, the political impact that these populations \u2014 Mexicans with dual nationality and those who vote from abroad \u2014 can have is considerably small.\n\nThe National Electoral Institute, or INE, reported that the electoral roll in the 2023-\u201924 voting year exceeded 100 million registered citizens. Figures from the Ministry of the Interior and the SRE indicate that this year, slightly more than 227,000 Mexicans living abroad have the right to vote.\n\nLiving, working on the border\n\nThe connection between Mexico and the United States is evident with residents living their daily lives on both sides of the border. Some cross daily to go to school, shop or work, and others visit family on weekends.\n\nThis has been Sotelo\u2019s life for more than five decades.\n\nHer grandfather and father were part of the Bracero program. She was born in Mexico, and completed her naturalization process into the United States. in the 1990s. She obtained her bachelor\u2019s degree in Ju\u00e1rez but continued her graduate studies in El Paso.\n\nShe now works at the University of Texas at El Paso but is involved in the Ju\u00e1rez community, cultural and political activities.\n\nLevi Pereda, who was born in El Paso, has a similar journey. Whenever he is asked where he is from, he says Ju\u00e1rez. He grew up there most of his life, and began working in El Paso when he was in high school. He began his university studies in Texas, and completed his master\u2019s degree. He lived in Houston for eight years before moving back to El Paso two years ago.\n\nHe works a remote job, so his lifestyle allows him to easily divide his time between both cities.\n\nPereda said he feels emotionally identified with his Mexican nationality, but said he places importance on his U.S. side since that\u2019s where he derives his family\u2019s financial support.\n\n\u201cI think that my economic stability is more linked to the United States elections, but in terms of importance, I think I give the same value to both,\u201d he said.\n\nAlejandro Orquiz is a psychology student at a Ju\u00e1rez university but works in the restaurant industry in the United States. on weekends.\n\nThis year marked the first time the 20-year-old voted in an election in Mexico.\n\nHis sister, Karime, 23, who studies and works in the United States and returns to Ju\u00e1rez on weekends, voted in presidential elections in Mexico in 2018 and in the United States in 2020.\n\nThis is the first time she\u2019ll be able to vote in two presidential elections the same year.\n\n\u201cLiving in both countries, either mandate affects me,\u201d she says.\n\nDaniel Ordo\u00f1ez was born in El Paso, but grew up in Mexico and identifies as Mexican. He lived for two years in Kingsville, Texas, and has now been living in his hometown for two years \u2013 crossing into Ju\u00e1rez occasionally to visit friends or for doctor\u2019s appointments.\n\nHe describes his relationship with both countries as \u201cneither black nor white\u201d \u2013 there are things you like and don\u2019t like about both, he said. Still, he says he feels the Mexican election carries more impact to him because his family and his wife\u2019s family live in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez.\n\nVoter impact in U.S. vs. Mexico\n\nKarime says that, in 2018, her vote in Mexico was based more on the information she received from her family. For these elections he thinks he should do more research on the candidates and choose based on what seems \u201cmost sensible\u201d to her. She describes her political leanings as \u201csomewhat liberal\u201d in both countries.\n\nHer brother Alejandro said he is only considering voting in the Mexican elections this year, because for him American politics seems \u201calien.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel that what happens in Mexico affects me more directly than what happens in the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe that exercising the right to vote is essential in social terms, but not knowing what American politics is, I prefer to abstain.\u201d\n\nFor Alejandro, the electoral college system in the United States seems intimidating and confusing to understand.\n\n\u201cCompletely different worlds,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the United States, you vote for a person who will watch over and vote for your interests (under the electoral college). Here (in Mexico) is your raw vote. You vote for a candidate and that\u2019s your vote.\u201d\n\nSotelo also considers that the electoral process in the United States is very complex compared with that of Mexico.\n\n\u201cEl Paso has historically voted Democratic but it does not represent the ideals of the rest of the state, which is one of the most Republican,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cRight now I think that my vote is going to have more impact in the United States. I feel that in Mexico I participated in what I had to participate in and now it\u2019s my turn here,\u201d Sotelo said. \u201cThis country is in complete decline and it is the one that is giving me work. Maybe my participation in these elections in (the United States) will be more important.\u201d",

        "text": "Mercer Votes helps students prepare for presidential election\nMercer University students voted at a record rate in the last presidential election, and a campus coalition is working to achieve high voter turnout again this year.\n\nIn the lead-up to the November presidential election, Mercer Votes has launched a website, vote.mercer.edu, to provide voter registration information and election resources to students and the campus community. The group also plans to enlist the help of student ambassadors and host campus events to get students interested in the election.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at keeping them informed and keeping them engaged,\u201d said Lauren Shinholster, associate director of engaged learning at Mercer. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at some innovative ways to get them excited about the election and informed about the issues that they\u2019re going to vote on.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Mercer Votes recently was awarded an Ask Every Student implementation grant of $5,000 to support its voter registration efforts.\n\nMercer Votes is a nonpartisan coalition that advances the University\u2019s voter registration, education and turnout efforts. It started as Mobilize Mercer, a student organization, in 2016 and transitioned to Mercer Votes in 2021 to bring together campus and community partners.\n\nThe coalition model also allows Mercer Votes to apply for grant money. Through the Campus Vote Project Democracy Fellows program, students are hired to advance nonpartisan voter engagement by registering, educating and mobilizing voters. Mercer Votes is recruiting fellows for the 2024-25 academic year.\n\nAs a Campus Vote Project Democracy Fellow, Mercer alumna Atia Bailey planned campus events to engage and inform students about voting. Bailey graduated in December with a Bachelor of Arts in law and public policy and sociology. She will be attending law school at Howard University in the fall.\n\nAtia Bailey\n\n\u201cMost of the events that I threw were kind of informational and also fun. We tried to do a little bit of both,\u201d she said. \u201cWe did voting bingo. We also did a block party and a gerrymandering balloon pop. We did tie-dye that we called blur the lines of red, white and blue. \u2026 Most of what I did was planning events that were fun but also sneaking information in there.\u201d\n\nBailey, of Grayson, spearheaded the idea to transition Mobilize Mercer from a student organization to a wider coalition. She was recently named to the 2024 ALL IN Student Voting Honor Roll for her voter engagement efforts at Mercer.\n\nShe got into nonpartisan work after an internship with Jon Ossoff\u2019s campaign for U.S. senator during her freshman year.\n\n\u201cThat was really important, especially during the runoff to remind people that they had to vote again,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cBut I kind of felt bad telling people, like my friends and classmates, that they should vote for a specific candidate because I don\u2019t know what their values are. I don\u2019t know if they believe the same things that I do, and I kind of felt like I might turn people off of voting by supporting a specific candidate. And that\u2019s why I wanted to get into nonpartisan work.\u201d\n\nMercer is a national leader for student voter engagement efforts. In 2016, then-senior Joey Wozniak, an economics and political science double-major, created the SoCon Votes competition for democratic engagement at Southern Conference schools. Other conferences have since created their own challenges, Shinholster said.\n\nIn addition, Mercer is one of 258 colleges and universities nationwide to be named a Voter Friendly Campus for 2023-24.\n\nDuring the 2020 presidential election, Mercer had a voting rate of 72.5%, which was higher than the national average of 66%, according to the 2020 National Study of Learning, Voting and Engagement Campus Report. It was the University\u2019s highest voting rate since it started keeping track in 2016.\n\n\u201cAt Mercer, we talk about every student majoring in changing the world. For us, we look at voting as an extension of that,\u201d Shinholster said. \u201cSo, when we talk about students being involved in this process, we want them to understand that the vote they are casting this year will have consequences potentially for the rest of their lifetime and for future generations.\n\n\u201cFor us, it\u2019s really important that students connect, not only to the candidates that they\u2019re voting for, but more importantly, to the social issues that those candidates stand for.\u201d",

        "text": "Donald Trump was convicted without cameras in the New York courtroom. Will his other court cases be televised?\nDonald Trump was convicted without cameras in courtroom. Should the trial of a former president be televised? The New York trial touched on an evergreen debate in legal circles about the role that televised proceedings play in promoting transparency and educating the public on legal matters. Former President Donald Trump appears at Manhattan court during jury deliberations in his criminal hush money trial in New York, Thursday, May 30, 2024. Steven Hirsch/New York Post via AP\n\nIt\u2019s a momentous event to be witness to: for the first time in U.S. history, a former president was found guilty on multiple felony charges.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is now a convicted felon (or will be soon) after a New York jury found him guilty of falsifying business records in connection with a hush-money payment made to porn star Stormy Daniels to cover up a sex scandal.\n\nBut unless you were among the dozens of people with courtroom access, you didn\u2019t actually get to bear witness to the trial, which proceeded, in accordance with New York law, without TV cameras in the courtroom.\n\nThat fact \u2014 while not consequential to the case\u2019s outcome, Northeastern University legal experts say \u2014 touches on an evergreen debate in legal circles about the role that televised proceedings play in promoting transparency and educating the public on legal matters.\n\nUniversity Distinguished Professor Daniel S. Medwed, and Jeremy Paul, former dean of the School of Law. Photos by Matthew Modoono/Northeastern University and Alyssa Stone/Northeastern University\n\nWith three more potential trials \u2014 two related to Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election, another tied to his handling of classified documents \u2014 on the horizon, the question of whether officials should break the rules and allow cameras in court is sure to arise again. Trump, himself, requested a televised trial in a case handled by special counsel Jack Smith involving election interference.\n\n\u201cI am generally a believer in cameras in the courtroom, based on the belief that trials are public and access in the modern age may require something more than mere physical access to the courtroom,\u201d says Daniel Medwed, Northeastern distinguished professor of law and criminal justice.\n\nMedwed argues that cameras should be the default in courtrooms \u201cunless there is a showing that it imposes undue security or privacy concerns.\u201d\n\nFederal law prohibits cameras in federal court cases. Two of Trump\u2019s other three cases are in federal court; one a classified documents case in South Florida and the other a federal election interference case in Washington, D.C. So unless the court allows an exception to the law, those cases will not be televised.\n\nThe fourth case involves alleged election interference in Georgia that is being prosecuted by the state in Fulton County. Prosecution has been delayed but testimony in hearings in the case was televised earlier this year.\n\nBut Paul says there are valid arguments for and against the use of cameras in high-profile cases.",

        "text": "Donald Trump is convicted. Could he still be President of the United States?\nDonald Trump, the former United States President and putative Republican nominee for the White House, has been found guilty of falsifying records to cover up a hush money payment he made in 2016 to an adult film actor.\n\nTrump is now officially a felon, a criminal convicted of a serious crime, which presents an unprecedented situation in the history of the American presidency and indeed, in the history of America itself. What happens now?\n\nWhat punishment will Trump get for his crime?\n\nThis will be known on July 11, the date that judge Juan M Merchan has set for the sentencing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlvin L Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney who prosecuted the case, has not said what punishment he would seek for Trump. In theory, the judge could put Trump in jail for up to four years, but he is not required to do so \u2014 and the former President could end up getting a probation.\n\nWhat happens to his campaign as a result of the conviction?\n\nNot much. The Republican National Convention is scheduled to begin in Milwaukee on July 15, at the end of which Trump is expected to officially accept the party\u2019s nomination.\n\nMeanwhile, he will appeal, first to the Appellate Division in Manhattan and, if he fails to get relief, to the Court of Appeals in Albany, the highest court in New York state. He then has the option of going to the US Supreme Court.\n\nIn any case, the appeals are expected to continue far beyond the presidential election of November 5. He is at the moment free to campaign, and could remain so even after the sentencing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, even if Trump is jailed, he can campaign from prison. The last precedent for this is the case of Eugene V Debs, who ran as the Socialist candidate for US President in 1920 while in prison. Debs received 3.4% of the vote in the election that was won by Warren G Harding of the Republican party.\n\nWhile Trump has been tried and convicted in Manhattan, New York City, in the Stormy Daniels hush money case, he still faces three other criminal cases \u2014 two in federal courts in South Florida and Washington DC, and one in a state court in Georgia.\n\nThese three cases are more serious and complex than the hush money case \u2014 Trump is accused of mishandling classified documents in Florida and of conspiracy to subvert democracy in the other two prosecutions \u2014 but have been delayed. It is possible that trial does not begin in any of these cases until Election Day.\n\nDoes this mean he can be a candidate for President even after being convicted?\n\nYes. Under the US Constitution, a candidate must only be 35 years or older, be a \u201cnatural born\u201d citizen, and should have lived in the US for at least 14 years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso Read | Why Trump has refused to endorse a national abortion ban in US\n\nThere is no bar based on a candidate\u2019s criminal record. In some American states, felons are not allowed to run for state or local offices, but this does not apply to federal offices, including that of President.\n\nThe New York Times said in an explainer that states could, in theory, try to keep Trump off the ballot by passing legislation requiring a clean criminal record, but this would be on \u201clegally shaky ground\u201d.\n\nWhat is this argument about the 14th Amendment to the US Constitution?\n\nSection 3 of the 14th Amendment says that \u201cno person shall\u2026hold any office, civil or military, under the United States,\u2026or as an officer of the United States\u201d if he has \u201cengaged in insurrection or rebellion\u201d after having \u201ctaken an oath\u2026to support the Constitution\u201d.\n\nIt had been argued that Trump\u2019s actions before and on January 6, 2021, when his supporters stormed the US Capitol, disqualified him on this count \u2014 and he had been found ineligible by the Colorado Supreme Court and the Secretary of State in Maine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, in March this year, the US Supreme Court ruled that states could not push Trump off the ballot under this section. The court concluded that only the US Congress could enforce the bar in Section 3 against a candidate running for federal office.\n\nWhat if the Republican Party decides that Trump cannot be its candidate?\n\nTrump has already got the support of the majority of delegates to the Republican Convention. There is now no mechanism available to nominate someone other than Trump to the ticket.\n\nThe New York Times explainer noted that under the party\u2019s official convention rules, if a delegate tries to support someone other than the person the primary results bound them to, \u201csuch support shall not be recognized\u201d.\n\nThe party could have someone else if Trump were to withdraw on his own. But as of now, no top Republican has suggested that they should dump Trump, and this situation looks unlikely to change.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOK, so Trump can contest \u2014 but can he vote?\n\nIn India, an undertrial prisoner can contest an election, but he cannot vote. In the US, this will probably depend on what kind of sentence he gets.\n\nTrump is a voter in Florida, and convicted felons in that state have their right to vote taken away until they have completed their sentence and paid all fines etc. But New York, where the conviction happened, allows felons to vote while on parole or probation.\n\nAlso Read | Express View on the US presidential race: Change and continuity\n\nIn this light, The New York Times explainer said: \u201c\u2026There is a chance that if New York would let Trump vote, then Florida will, too. There\u2019s a provision in Florida law that might apply New York\u2019s standards, because that\u2019s where the conviction happened.\u201d\n\nHowever, if Trump were to be put in prison rather than being given probation, he will not be able to vote in his own election.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs it possible that Trump is elected while in jail?\n\nYes. There is nothing in the law to make him ineligible due to his being in jail. Legal experts quoted in the American media have said the framers of the Constitution probably never conceived of this possibility.\n\nBut it is not known how such a presidency might function. \u201cWe\u2019re so far removed from anything that\u2019s ever happened,\u201d Erwin Chemerinsky, a constitutional law expert at the University of California, Berkeley, told The New York Times.\n\nThis would be a new and unprecedented legal crisis, and a battle in the courts will likely inevitably follow.",

        "text": "Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ning\u2019s Regular Press Conference on May 31, 2024\nFrom June 4 to 8, at the invitation of Premier Li Qiang of the State Council, Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan will pay an official visit to China.\n\nFrom June 3 to 5, at the invitation of Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Yi, T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan will pay an official visit to China.\n\nAssociated Press of Pakistan: A follow-up question on Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif\u2019s visit to China. Could you share some detail of his visit? And how does China view the current relations between Pakistan and China? And what is China\u2019s expectation for the visit?\n\nMao Ning: This is Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif\u2019s first visit to China after the new Pakistani government came into office this year. During his visit, President Xi Jinping, Premier Li Qiang and Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People\u2019s Congress Zhao Leji will meet or have talks with him. The leaders of the two countries will have an in-depth exchange of views on China-Pakistan relations and issues of mutual interest, and jointly draw up a blueprint for the growth of bilateral relations. In addition to Beijing, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif will visit Guangdong and Shaanxi.\n\nChina and Pakistan are all-weather strategic cooperative partners and ironclad friends. Our friendship has stood the test of time and remained rock-solid and\u2014to use a Chinese expression\u2014\u201csteady as Mount Tai.\u201d Under the guidance of the leaders of the two countries, China and Pakistan have in recent years had close high-level exchanges, steadily advanced practical cooperation, conducted fruitful and high-quality cooperation on the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, and maintained sound communication and coordination in international and regional affairs. China stands ready to work with Pakistan through this visit to make greater progress in our all-weather strategic cooperative partnership and take new steps in the building of an even closer China-Pakistan community with a shared future in the new era.\n\nReuters: According to sources, China has confirmed that it will not attend the Ukraine peace conference to be hosted by Switzerland next month. China has declined the invitation, because the conditions for China\u2019s participation are not met, including the participation of both Russia and Ukraine, the sources said. Would the Foreign Ministry like to comment on this matter?\n\nMao Ning: China attaches great importance to Switzerland organizing the first Summit on Peace in Ukraine and has been in close communication with Switzerland and relevant parties on this since early this year. China always maintains that the international peace conference needs to meet the three important elements of recognition from both Russia and Ukraine, equal participation of all parties, and fair discussion of all peace plans. Otherwise, the peace conference can hardly play a substantive role for restoring peace. These elements proposed by China are fair, legitimate and do not target any party. They are written into the Common Understandings on Political Settlement of the Ukraine Crisis jointly issued by China and Brazil recently and reflect the universal concern of the international community, especially the vast developing countries.\n\nBased on what we have heard from various parties and the released arrangement for the meeting, it doesn\u2019t seem that the three elements proposed by China will be met. There is an apparent gap between the meeting\u2019s arrangement and what China stands for as well as the universal expectation in the international community. In this case, China is hardly able to take part in the meeting and has informed relevant parties of our consideration and concerns. We will continue to promote talks for peace in our own way, maintain communication with all parties and jointly accumulate conditions for the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis.\n\nKyodo News: When meeting with Premier Li Qiang, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida asked China again to resume the short-term visa-free policy as soon as possible. China previously said that Japan needs to take reciprocal measures. Has this position changed?\n\nMao Ning: China attaches importance to the hope expressed by various quarters in Japan for resuming visa-free entry into China. We hope that Japan will work with us in the same direction and jointly raise the level of facilitation for travel between our two countries.\n\nKyodo News: You just mentioned \u201cwork with us in the same direction.\u201d Does it mean that Japan needs to adopt a reciprocal measure?\n\nMao Ning: It means working in the same direction. Both sides need to move forward.\n\nReuters: Former US President and Republican Party candidate Donald Trump has been convicted by a New York jury of felonies related to the 2016 election. If he is elected, would Trump\u2019s conviction prevent him from visiting China if he was invited or present any other difficulties for Sino-American relations?\n\nMao Ning: I will not comment on the US presidential election or any other US domestic affair. We hope that whoever gets elected will be committed to growing sound and stable China-US ties, because it will be in the interest of both countries and both peoples.\n\nFolha de S.Paulo: The Brazilian Vice President will lead a delegation of ministers next week to Beijing for trade and investment talks. What concrete steps do you expect from the meetings? And another question: An American envoy said in Brazil that \u201canyone who is thinking of joining the Belt and Road Initiative should think better and see how sovereignty is taken away.\u201d In light of the Brazilian delegation coming to Beijing, how do you respond?\n\nMao Ning: On your first question, China and Brazil are comprehensive strategic partners. Relations between the two countries have registered continued and steady growth in recent years, with frequent high-level visits, fruitful cooperation in various areas, and close coordination on international and regional affairs, setting a fine example of major developing countries working together in solidarity for common development. This year marks the 50th anniversary of the diplomatic relations between China and Brazil. The two sides agreed to hold the meeting of the China-Brazil High-level Coordination and Cooperation Committee to discuss further expanding bilateral cooperation. Please stay tuned.\n\nOn your second question, Belt and Road cooperation is an important measure of China\u2019s high-standard opening up and an international cooperation platform for inclusive and universally beneficial economic globalization. It has made tangible development achievements and is widely welcomed by the international community. Facts prove that the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) advocates extensive consultation and joint contribution for shared benefits instead of supremacy; it advances connectivity instead of decoupling and severing of supply chains; it pursues win-win cooperation instead of antagonism and confrontation. Over the past decade since the BRI was put forward, China has signed more than 200 Belt and Road cooperation documents with over 150 countries and over 30 international organizations, and set up close to 100 bilateral cooperation mechanisms. According to international institutions\u2019 estimates, BRI will contribute US$1.6 trillion of annual global welfare by 2030.\n\nPerhaps you could ask this American envoy, can he specify which country\u2019s sovereignty was taken away by joining the BRI. As far as I know, many countries who have joined the BRI have actually become better able to protect their independence and sovereignty because of the economic and welfare benefits that the BRI has brought them.\n\nChina and Brazil are comprehensive strategic partners and are each other\u2019s development opportunities. Both countries highly value independence. We believe that Brazil will not be misled by such baseless rhetoric and will make decisions independently in the interest of its own development. The BRI is highly compatible with Brazil\u2019s development strategies such as the New Industry Brazil and the New Growth Acceleration Program. As we mark the 50th anniversary of China-Brazil diplomatic relations this year, China stands ready to work for greater synergy between the development strategies of the two countries and achieve more positive outcomes.\n\nCCTV: Days ago, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) delivered an advisory opinion concerning the obligations of State Parties to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) as regard to the impact of their climate change response on marine environment. The opinion partly cited the award of the South China Sea Arbitration. The Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs said in a statement released days ago that this bolsters and reinforces the legitimacy of the 2016 Arbitration Award and its unassailable status as part of the corpus of international law. What\u2019s China\u2019s comment?\n\nMao Ning: China\u2019s position on the arbitral award on the South China Sea is consistent and clear. The arbitral tribunal in the South China Sea Arbitration exercised its jurisdiction ultra vires and made an illegitimate ruling. The rendered award is illegal, null and void. The award does not constitute part of international law; instead it has had an adverse impact on the international rule of law. China neither accepts nor participates in that arbitration, neither accepts nor recognizes the award, and will never accept any claim or action arising from the award. Our attitude is only legitimate and just in order to uphold the integrity and authority of UNCLOS and the international rule of law. The world is not blind to the truth. China\u2019s position has received understanding and support from the international community. The fair-minded in the world have criticized and called into question the arbitral award.\n\nThe advisory opinion issued by ITLOS focuses on climate change response and marine environment protection, and doesn\u2019t cover issues of territorial and maritime disputes or the validity of arbitral award on the South China Sea. The advisory opinion bears on the overall interest of the international community and should not be used by some country as a tool to seek selfish gains. We believe that neither ITLOS or any other country would want to see the advisory opinion being distorted by that illegal, null and void award. Any hypes that seek to mislead the public will fail. They will not turn the null and void award into a legal one, nor could they ever weaken China\u2019s firm resolve to defend our territorial integrity and maritime rights and interests.\n\nReuters: How much of an achievement is it that Zambia\u2019s debt restructuring deal is almost finalized? And what have been the learnings for China from being involved in an official creditor committee and the common framework?\n\nMao Ning: Congratulations on the important progress in the negotiations on Zambia\u2019s debt restructuring. As Zambia\u2019s good friend and good partner, China takes seriously Zambia\u2019s concerns about the debt issue. China is the first international official creditor to provide debt relief for Zambia and, as the co-chair of the Official Creditor Committee for Zambia, has led its work which made significant progress in Zambia\u2019s debt restructuring. Our contribution is well recognized by Zambia and the international community. China will continue to coordinate with relevant parties to move forward the follow-up work regarding Zambia\u2019s debt treatment.\n\nIn handling the debt issues of developing countries, China has always acted with a long-term perspective of assisting the development of relevant countries. We call on the international community to work with China and continue to take concrete actions to support Zambia and other African countries in achieving greater economic and social progress.\n\nAFP: A follow-up question on Donald Trump. Donald Trump mentioned Taiwan at a recent campaign event. Do you have any comment on this? And does China fear Trump may become the next US President?\n\nMao Ning: The US presidential election is the domestic affair of the US. I would not comment on campaign rhetoric.",

        "text": "Donald Trump found guilty of hush-money plot to influence 2016 election\nDonald Trump has been found guilty of all 34 counts of falsifying business records in a criminal hush-money scheme to influence the outcome of the 2016 election.\n\nThe verdict came after a jury deliberated for less than 12 hours in the unprecedented first criminal trial against a US president, current or former. It marks a perilous political moment for Trump, the presumptive nominee for the Republican nomination, whose poll numbers have remained unchanged throughout the trial but could tank at any moment.\n\nTrump was convicted by a jury of 12 New Yorkers of felony falsification of business records, which makes it a crime for a person to make or cause false entries in records with the intent to commit a second crime. He will be sentenced on 11 July at 10am ET.\n\n\u201cThis was a rigged trial by a conflicted judge who was corrupt,\u201d Trump said at the courthouse after the verdict was read. \u201cThis was a rigged trial, a disgrace.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyer Todd Blanche stated during an appearance on CNN that he would appeal the verdict \u201cas soon as we can\u201d. The appellate process could take months, even years, to play out, meaning it could be a while before the sentence would take effect.\n\nFor the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg, the verdict was an astonishing victory, coming after some scepticism of the wisdom of bringing such a case and the huge risks involved.\n\nHe said after the verdict: \u201cTwelve everyday jurors vowed to make a decision based on the evidence and the law and the evidence and the law alone. Their deliberations led them to a unanimous conclusion beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant Donald J Trump is guilty.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWhile this defendant might be unlike any other in American history, we arrived at this trial and ultimately today this verdict in the same manner as every other case.\u201d\n\n1:03 DA says prosecutors followed facts \u2018without fear or favour\u2019 after Trump found guilty \u2013 video\n\nJoe Biden\u2019s campaign said \u201cno one is above the law\u201d in an email sent soon after the verdict.\n\n\u201cIn New York today, we saw that no one is above the law. Donald Trump has always mistakenly believed he would never face consequences for breaking the law for his own personal gain,\u201d wrote Michael Tyler, Biden\u2019s communications director.\n\n\u201cBut today\u2019s verdict does not change the fact that the American people face a simple reality. There is still only one way to keep Donald Trump out of the Oval Office: at the ballot box. Convicted felon or not, Trump will be the Republican nominee for president.\u201d\n\nIn the Trump case, the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office alleged Trump falsely recorded the reimbursements he made to his former lawyer Michael Cohen, who paid the adult film star Stormy Daniels $130,000 for her silence about her affair with Trump, as \u201clegal expenses\u201d.\n\nThe prosecution alleged the falsifications were made to conceal Trump\u2019s violation of New York state election law, which makes it a crime to promote the election of any person to office through unlawful means.\n\nProsecutors argued, in part, that those unlawful means were the $130,000 payment to Daniels, which was in effect an illegal campaign contribution, because it was done for the benefit of his 2016 campaign and exceeded the $2,700 individual contribution cap.\n\n2:57 Inside Donald Trump\u2019s hush-money trial: three key testimonies \u2013 video\n\nAfter the verdict, the lawyer for Stormy Daniels said she was \u201crelieved that this case is now over\u201d, in a statement shared by the New York Times. Clark Brewster said: \u201cShe always had great faith in our justice system and in the solemn oath jurors take in undertaking their service.\u201d\n\nCohen said in a statement that it was \u201can important day for accountability and the rule of law\u201d. He added: \u201cWhile it has been a difficult journey for me and my family, the truth always matters.\u201d\n\nLater in an interview with MSNBC he said he was \u201crelieved\u201d by the verdict. \u201cThis has been six years in the making,\u201d he said.\n\nRepublicans meanwhile reacted furiously, with the House speaker, Mike Johnson, saying it was a \u201cshameful day in American history\u201d while Elise Stefanik, chair of the House Republican conference, said it showed, \u201chow corrupt, rigged, and unAmerican the weaponized justice system has become under Joe Biden and Democrats\u201d.\n\nTrump\u2019s children also expressed anger, with Donald Trump Jr, the former president\u2019s eldest child, posting on X that the Democrats had \u201csucceeded in their years long attempt to turn America into a third-world shithole\u201d.\n\nProsecutors called 20 witnesses who, over the course of four weeks, gave evidence of how Trump plotted with the tabloid mogul David Pecker and Cohen to bury accounts of affairs with Daniels and the Playboy model Karen McDougal.\n\nThe witnesses \u2013 some friendly to Trump, others openly hostile \u2013 said Trump\u2019s worry over the Daniels story intensified after the October 2016 release of the infamous Access Hollywood tape, in which Trump was caught on a hot mic bragging about sexual assault.\n\nThe recording featured Trump boasting about being able to grab women \u201cby the pussy\u201d without their consent because he was famous. Trial witnesses testified the Trump campaign worried that his efforts to dismiss the tape as \u201clocker-room talk\u201d would fail if more boorish behavior came to light.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Trump on Trial Free newsletter Stay up to date on all of Donald Trump\u2019s trials.

Cohen did so in the belief that Trump would reimburse him, he testified.\n\nIn January 2017, Cohen said, he discussed with Trump and the former Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg about being repaid for the $130,000, an overdue bonus and other expenses he incurred doing work that benefited the Trump 2016 campaign.\n\nCohen produced 11 invoices seeking payment pursuant to a legal \u201cretainer\u201d that did not exist, according to Cohen, which led to 11 checks being cut to Cohen and the Trump Organization recording 12 entries for \u201clegal expense\u201d on its general ledger \u2013 totaling 34 instances of alleged falsifications.\n\nCohen, who was the final witness for the prosecution, said Trump was furious when he learned that Daniels was on the verge of going public \u2013 not least because Cohen had previously worked with Daniels\u2019s lawyer Keith Davidson, in 2011, to remove the affair story from a gossip website.\n\n\u201cJust take care of it,\u201d Cohen recalled Trump saying. \u201cThis was a disaster, a fucking disaster. Women will hate me.\u201d\n\nProsecutor Susan Hoffinger asked Cohen: \u201cWould you have made that payment to Stormy Daniels without getting a sign-off from Mr Trump?\u201d\n\nCohen said: \u201cNo, because everything required Mr Trump\u2019s sign-off. And on top of that, I wanted the money back.\u201d\n\nCohen said he filed bogus invoices for legal services to cover up the reimbursements, and repeatedly said Trump was the force behind the Daniels plot. He carried out the payoff \u201cto ensure that the story would not come out, would not affect Mr Trump\u2019s chances of becoming president of the United States\u201d.\n\nIn a watershed moment, Cohen told jurors these repayments started not long after an 8 February 2017 meeting with Trump in the Oval Office, where they talked about money. Cohen hadn\u2019t been repaid anything for the payoff.\n\n\u201cSo, I was sitting with President Trump and he asked me if I was OK, he asked me if I needed money, and I said: \u2018No, all good,\u2019\u201d Cohen told jurors. \u201cHe said, \u2018All right, just make sure you deal with Allen.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cAllen\u201d referenced Allen Weisselberg, the Trump Organization\u2019s chief financial officer at the time, who was recently incarcerated for lying at Trump\u2019s recent civil fraud trial. Weisselberg had previously pleaded guilty to tax crimes, for which he was also jailed.\n\nCohen submitted $35,000 invoices for each month, listing the bill as for legal services. He said it was actually for \u201cthe reimbursement, to me, of the hush-money fee along with [another expense] and the bonus\u201d.\n\nHoffinger went through every invoice and pay document and asked Cohen whether it was for legal services \u2013 or false. Cohen repeatedly said that the descriptions of invoices and payments in emails and business documents were, in fact, false.\n\nView image in fullscreen Protesters outside court in Manhattan on Thursday. Photograph: Andrea Renault/Zuma/Rex/Shutterstock\n\n\u201cWhat I was doing was at the direction of and benefit of Mr Trump,\u201d Cohen said at one point, among the many times he directly implicated Trump. \u201cEverything required Mr Trump\u2019s sign-off.\u201d\n\nDaniels provided stunning testimony that undermined Trump\u2019s denials that they had sex following a celebrity golf event in Lake Tahoe nearly two decades ago. After rejecting Trump\u2019s invitation to dinner, Daniels decided to go on the advice of a colleague, who said: \u201cIt\u2019ll make a great story.\u201d\n\nDaniels said she went to Trump\u2019s hotel room, and they decided to chat before having something to eat. He asked over and over about her work as an adult film actor, repeatedly asking her questions such as: \u201cWhat about testing? Do you worry about STDs?\u201d\n\nHad she been tested?\n\n\u201cYes, of course, and I volunteered it as well,\u201d Daniels said. \u201cHe asked me, Oh, well, have you ever had a bad test? I said: \u2018Nope. I can show you my entire record.\u2019\u201d\n\nTrump, she said, started to show photos to Daniels at one point, including one of Melania, about which she commented that his wife was \u201cvery beautiful\u201d \u2013 but allegedly added she should not worry about Melania because \u201cwe don\u2019t even sleep in the same room\u201d.\n\nThey spoke about Trump\u2019s show The Apprentice, and Daniels said there would be no way she would make it on TV given her line of work.\n\n\u201cYou remind me of my daughter. She is smart and blonde and beautiful, and people underestimate her as well,\u201d Daniels remembered Trump saying.\n\nDaniels said she excused herself for the restroom, which was through a bedroom. When she came out, Trump was on the bed, in his underwear and a T-shirt.\n\n\u201cAt first I was just startled, like a jump scare,\u201d Daniels said. \u201cI just thought: oh my God, what did I misread to get here? The intention is pretty clear if someone\u2019s stripped down to their underwear and on the bed.\u201d\n\nDaniels tried to leave but he stood between her and the door, albeit \u201cnot in a threatening manner\u201d, she said.\n\n\u201cHe said, I thought we were getting somewhere. I thought you were serious about what you wanted, if you want to get out of that trailer park \u2026 \u201d Daniels testified. \u201cI was offended, because I never lived in a trailer park.\u201d Daniels said they had sex.\n\nThe description of the hotel room encounter was uncomfortable and cringe-inducing testimony, one of the prosecutors suggested in closing arguments. But that was precisely why Trump was so desperate to suppress the story \u2013 and conceal that he had done so.\n\n\u201cThis scheme, cooked up by these men, at this time, could very well be what got President Trump elected,\u201d the prosecutor Joshua Steinglass said.",

        "text": "Donald Trump found guilty. Can he now run for US Presidential race?\nDonald Trump, former US president and Republican candidate, was found guilty in the first criminal trial of a former US president in the nation\u2019s history. The latest guilty verdict in Donald Trump\u2019s Manhattan criminal trial could reshape the political landscape five months before Election Day.\n\nThe leading candidates in the US presidential race, President Joe Biden and Donald Trump, have set in for an atypical situation this time ahead of the general election scheduled for November this year. Since one of the leading candidates is a convicted felon, this underscoring an unprecedented scenario in US political history.\n\nAlso read: Donald Trump convicted in hush money criminal case. Here's what happens next It is noteworthy that Donald Trump leads Joe Biden in most polls after surviving two impeachments and numerous other scandals. On May 30, he was found guilty of falsifying business records as part of a scheme to unlawfully affect the 2016 election through hush money payments to a porn actress who claimed they had an encounter.\n\nAlso read: Donald Trump convicted: Shares in Trump Media slump after former president found guilty in hush money trial As per the US Constitution, the presidential candidate must be at least 35 years old and a US citizen to run for elections who should have lived in the country for 14 years. Thus, a criminal conviction will have no impact on his ability to become president. Even if the former US President were sentenced to prison before the election, he could continue with his campaign. Considering opinion polls, a conviction could cost Trump votes in the upcoming elections.\n\nAlso read: Trump Guilty Verdict Adds Twist to 2024 Race: A Convicted Felon Is Donald Trump eligible to cast a vote? Donald Trump can cast a vote for himself in Florida in November\u2019s election as long as he stays out of prison in New York state. Donald Trump resides in Florida, and as per laws of this particular state, the voting rights of people with felony convictions are restricted.\n\nA University of Florida political scientist, Michael McDonald, in a social media post on X (formerly Twitter), stated, \u201cHis rights depend on his sentencing.\u201d He is known to have tracked his state\u2019s felony disenfranchisement rules which are different from other states\u2019 rules for residents convicted of out-of-state felonies.\n\nBlair Bowie of the Campaign Legal Center, in a post, stated, \u201cIf a Floridian\u2019s voting rights are restored in the state of conviction, they are restored under Florida law,\u201d reported AP. He highlighted that Florida's complex rules often confuse people without Donald Trump's legal resources.\n\nAlso read: Donald Trump convicted: Biden campaign echoes White House words, \u2018no one is above law\u2019; Trump calls himself \u2018innocent\u2019 In the case of Donald Trump, New York law stipulates that the right to vote is only revoked for individuals convicted of felonies during their incarceration. Upon release, their voting rights are automatically reinstated, even on parole, according to a law enacted by New York's Democratic legislature in 2021.\n\nDonald Trump will not be able to pardon himself of state charges in New York even after being elected as president again since the president's pardon power applies only to federal crimes.",

        "text": "Trump hush money verdict: Guilty of all 34 counts\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump became the first former American president to be convicted of felony crimes Thursday as a New York jury found him guilty of all 34 charges in a scheme to illegally influence the 2016 election through a hush money payment to a porn actor who said the two had sex.\n\nTrump sat stone-faced while the verdict was read as cheering from the street below could be heard in the hallway on the courthouse\u2019s 15th floor where the decision was revealed after more than nine hours of deliberations.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s conviction on 34 felony counts marks the end of his historic hush money trial. But the fight is far from over. Here\u2019s what to know.\n\nHow did Trump respond? Trump falsely blasted a \u2018rigged trial\u2019 and attacked star witness in a speech on Friday. Follow the AP\u2019s live coverage\n\nTrump falsely blasted a \u2018rigged trial\u2019 and attacked star witness in a speech on Friday. When is the sentencing? July 11, just days before Republicans\n\nJuly 11, just days before Can Trump vote? He may be convicted and reside in Florida, but can still vote\n\nHe may be convicted and reside in Florida, but Will this impact the election? It\u2019s unclear whether Trump\u2019s once-imaginable status as a person convicted of a felony will have any impact at all on voters.\n\n\u201cThis was a rigged, disgraceful trial,\u201d an angry Trump told reporters after leaving the courtroom. \u201cThe real verdict is going to be Nov. 5 by the people. They know what happened, and everyone knows what happened here.\u201d\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan set sentencing for July 11, just days before the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, where GOP leaders, who remained resolute in their support in the aftermath of the verdict, are expected to formally make him their nominee.\n\nThe verdict is a stunning legal reckoning for Trump and exposes him to potential prison time in the city where his manipulations of the tabloid press helped catapult him from a real estate tycoon to reality television star and ultimately president. As he seeks to reclaim the White House in this year\u2019s election, the judgment presents voters with another test of their willingness to accept Trump\u2019s boundary-breaking behavior.\n\nTrump is expected to appeal the verdict and will face an awkward dynamic as he returns to the campaign trail tagged with convictions. There are no campaign rallies on the calendar for now, though he traveled Thursday evening to a fundraiser in Manhattan that was planned before the verdict, according to three people familiar with his plans who were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nHe\u2019s expected to appear Friday at Trump Tower and will continue fundraising next week. His campaign was already moving quickly to raise money off the verdict, issuing a pitch that called him a \u201cpolitical prisoner.\u201d\n\nThe falsifying business records charges carry up to four years behind bars, though Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg would not say Thursday whether prosecutors intend to seek imprisonment, and it is not clear whether the judge \u2014 who earlier in the trial warned of jail time for gag order violations \u2014 would impose that punishment even if asked.\n\nThe conviction, and even imprisonment, will not bar Trump from continuing his White House pursuit.\n\nTrump faces three other felony indictments, but the New York case may be the only one to reach a conclusion before the November election, adding to the significance of the outcome. Though the legal and historical implications of the verdict are readily apparent, the political consequences are less so given its potential to reinforce rather than reshape already hardened opinions about Trump.\n\nAP AUDIO: Guilty: Trump becomes first former U.S. president convicted of felony crimes Former president Donald Trump found gulty in his hush money case. AP correspondent Julie Walker reports from court.\n\nFor another candidate in another time, a criminal conviction might doom a presidential run, but Trump\u2019s political career has endured through two impeachments, allegations of sexual abuse, investigations into everything from potential ties to Russia to plotting to overturn an election, and personally salacious storylines, including the emergence of a recording in which he boasted about grabbing women\u2019s genitals.\n\nThe case\u2019s general allegations have also been known to voters for years and, while tawdry, are widely seen as less grievous than the allegations he faces in three other cases that charge him with subverting American democracy and mishandling national security secrets.\n\nAhead of the verdict, Trump\u2019s campaign had argued that, no matter the jury\u2019s decision, the outcome was unlikely to sway voters and that the election would be decided by issues such as inflation.\n\nEven so, the verdict is likely to give President Joe Biden and fellow Democrats space to sharpen arguments that Trump is unfit for office, though the White House offered only a muted statement that it respected the rule of law. Conversely, the decision will provide fodder for the presumptive Republican nominee to advance his unsupported claims that he is victimized by a criminal justice system he insists is politically motivated against him.\n\nTrump maintained throughout the trial that he had done nothing wrong and that the case should never have been brought, railing against the proceedings from inside the courthouse \u2014 where he was joined by a parade of high-profile Republican allies \u2014 and racking up fines for violating a gag order with inflammatory out-of-court comments about witnesses.\n\nAfter the verdict, Trump lawyer Todd Blanche said in television news interviews that he did not believe Trump received a fair trial and that the team would appeal based on the judge\u2019s refusal to recuse himself and because of what he suggested was excessive pretrial publicity.\n\nRepublicans showed no sign of loosening their embrace of the party leader, with House Speaker Mike Johnson lamenting what he called \u201ca shameful day in American history.\u201d He called the case \u201ca purely political exercise, not a legal one.\u201d\n\nThe first criminal trial of a former American president always presented a unique test of the court system, not only because of Trump\u2019s prominence but also because of his relentless broadsides on the foundation of the case and its participants. But the verdict from the 12-person jury marked a repudiation of Trump\u2019s efforts to undermine confidence in the proceedings or to potentially impress the panel with a show of GOP support.\n\n\u201cWhile this defendant may be unlike any other in American history, we arrived at this trial and ultimately today in this verdict in the same manner as every other case that comes through the courtroom doors, by following the facts and the law and doing so without fear or favor,\u201d Bragg said after the verdict.\n\nThe trial involved charges that Trump falsified business records to cover up a hush money payment to Stormy Daniels, the porn actor who said she had sex with the married Trump in 2006.\n\nThe $130,000 payment came from Trump\u2019s former lawyer and personal fixer Michael Cohen to buy Daniels\u2019 silence during the final weeks of the 2016 race in what prosecutors allege was an effort to interfere in the election. When Cohen was reimbursed, the payments were recorded as legal expenses, which prosecutors said was an unlawful attempt to mask the true purpose of the transaction.\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyers contend they were legitimate payments for legal services. He denied the sexual encounter, and his lawyers argued at trial that his celebrity status made him an extortion target.\n\nDefense lawyers also said hush money deals to bury negative stories about Trump were motivated by personal considerations such as the impact on his family, not political ones. They also sought to undermine the credibility of Cohen, the star prosecution witness who pleaded guilty in 2018 to federal charges related to the payments, by suggesting he was driven by personal animus toward Trump and fame and money.\n\nThe trial featured weeks of occasionally riveting testimony that revisited an already well-documented chapter from Trump\u2019s past. His 2016 campaign, threatened by the disclosure of an \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d recording that captured him talking about grabbing women sexually without their permission, also faced the prospect of other stories about Trump and sex surfacing that could have harmed his candidacy.\n\nTrump did not testify, but jurors heard his voice through a secret recording of a conversation with Cohen in which he and the lawyer discussed a $150,000 hush money deal involving a Playboy model, Karen McDougal, who has said she had an affair with Trump. Trump denies that affair.\n\nDaniels herself testified, offering a vivid recounting of the sexual encounter she says they had in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite. The former publisher of the National Enquirer, David Pecker, testified about how he worked to keep stories harmful to the Trump campaign from becoming public at all, including by having his company buy McDougal\u2019s story.\n\nJurors also heard from Keith Davidson, the lawyer who negotiated the hush money payments on behalf of Daniels and McDougal. He detailed the tense negotiations to get both women compensated for their silence but also faced aggressive questioning from a Trump attorney who noted Davidson had helped broker similar hush money deals in cases involving other prominent figures.\n\nThe most pivotal witness, by far, was Cohen, who during days of testimony gave an insider\u2019s view of the hush money scheme and what he said was Trump\u2019s detailed knowledge of it.\n\n\u201cJust take care of it,\u201d he quoted Trump as saying.\n\nHe offered jurors the most direct link between Trump and the heart of the charges, recounting a meeting in which a plan to have Cohen reimbursed in monthly installments for legal services was discussed.\n\nAnd he emotionally described his dramatic break with Trump in 2018, when he began cooperating with prosecutors after a decade-long career as the then-president\u2019s personal fixer.\n\n\u201cTo keep the loyalty and to do the things that he had asked me to do, I violated my moral compass, and I suffered the penalty, as has my family,\u201d Cohen said.\n\nThe case, though criticized by some legal experts who called it the weakest of the prosecutions against Trump, took on added importance not only because it proceeded to trial first but also because it could be the only only one to reach a jury before the election.\n\nThe other three \u2014 local and federal cases in Atlanta and Washington alleging that he conspired to overturn the 2020 election, as well as a federal indictment in Florida charging him with illegally hoarding top-secret records \u2014 are bogged down by delays or appeals.\n\n____\n\nAssociated Press journalists Ruth Brown, Joseph B.

        "text": "Mexico\u2019s 2024 elections: Who\u2019s leading the polls and what\u2019s the next president\u2019s biggest challenge?\nOn June 2, nearly 100 million voters \u2014 including a record number of first-timers \u2014 will participate in Mexico\u2019s largest-ever elections, choosing a new president, all 628 members of the legislature, nine governors, and more than 19,000 local officials. The winning presidential candidate will succeed President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, known also as AMLO, and govern Mexico for the next six years.\n\nWATCH: What\u2019s at stake in Mexico\u2019s landmark presidential election\n\nBut so far in the campaign, dozens of candidates have been killed, and hundreds more have asked for state protection \u2014 particularly those vying for positions at the state and local levels \u2014 amid record levels of violence.\n\nWho are Mexicans voting for?\n\nThe leading presidential candidates are:\n\nClaudia Sheinbaum. A former environmental scientist and Mexico City mayor, Sheinbaum is the candidate for the ruling National Regeneration Movement (Morena) coalition and the current front-runner.\n\nX\u00f3chitl G\u00e1lvez. A successful tech entrepreneur and former senator supported by an alliance of opposition parties, G\u00e1lvez trails Sheinbaum by double digits in most polls.\n\nJorge \u00c1lvarez M\u00e1ynez. M\u00e1ynez, the candidate for the Movimiento Ciudadano (Citizens\u2019 Movement) party, polls in the single digits.\n\nWhat will be the biggest challenge facing the incoming administration?\n\nWhile the next president will benefit from the economic tailwinds of nearshoring (outsourcing business operations to nearby countries rather than far off ones), she faces a host of domestic challenges, including energy and water shortages, fiscal deficits, violence and the spread of organized crime, and the movement of millions of migrants into and through Mexico.\n\nEconomy. On the positive side, the next president inherits a growing economy, led by trade with the United States. In 2023, Mexico became the United States\u2019s largest trade partner, with bilateral exchanges nearing $900 billion. Foreign direct investment (FDI) also rose, reaching $36 billion. Much of it was funneled into manufacturing and companies looking to place production outside of China to more easily access U.S. markets. Still, these inflows fell short compared to other emerging markets and Mexico\u2019s own historic highs a decade ago. A top-fifteen global economy, Mexico received less than 3 percent of global FDI last year.\n\nLimited energy and water availability present significant barriers to a nearshoring boom and Mexico\u2019s industrial takeoff. A 2023 report from investment banking company Morgan Stanley estimated that Mexico needs to invest some $40 billion in power generation and distribution over the next presidential term to keep up with demand. To attract global manufacturing, much of this new electricity needs to be green. However, the current government\u2019s policies have stymied private-sector energy investment and prioritized fossil-fuel electricity generation over the use of renewables. Eleven states and the capital, Mexico City, face significant water shortages due in large part to decrepit infrastructure. This affects water-intensive business operations, such as beermaking and, increasingly, citizens\u2019 day-to-day life, and it looks to worsen with climate change.\n\nWhile she is an environmental scientist, Sheinbaum is also a statist, so the shift to a greener energy mix will be slowed by her reliance on government and state-owned enterprise investment instead of the private sector. In contrast, G\u00e1lvez is more willing to embrace private investment in the energy sector, which could lead to more supply under her administration.\n\nSecurity. The next president faces heightened insecurity and weakened rule of law. Over the past five years, Mexico has not gotten safer. The murder rate remains high and extortion rates have risen some 50 percent. Organized crime has spread geographically and expanded business operations, including protection rackets for avocado and lime farmers, contraband energy producers, and migrant smugglers. Complaints of public corruption are also rising. Meanwhile, the militarization of security has meant cuts to state and local law enforcement budgets, reducing the capability of civilian police.\n\nShe will also need to grapple with the expanded role of Mexico\u2019s military. Current President AMLO put troops in charge of customs, allowing them to oversee ports, airports, and the management of many of the government\u2019s largest infrastructure projects. This has limited transparency and accountability for major public works while leaving the military more vulnerable to the corrupt influence of organized crime groups. Rhetorically, Sheinbaum has not strayed from AMLO\u2019s \u201chugs, not bullets\u201d security approach that focuses more on social programs than law enforcement. She has also publicly supported the increased reliance on the military in domestic security, though as mayor she did invest in expanding, strengthening, and professionalizing the city\u2019s civilian police force. G\u00e1lvez is likely to lean into enforcement alongside social programs to halt spiraling violence, in addition to prioritizing civilian policing in basic safety and the rule of law.\n\nMigration. Migration is also a point of concern, as Mexico has become not just a sending country, but a major destination for sojourners. The Mexican government, working with the United States to limit migrant arrivals at the southern U.S. border, has broken up caravans, set up checkpoints, and bused migrants south. It has also accepted tens of thousands of individuals expelled from or told to wait in the country by the United States. Additionally, Mexico has seen record numbers of migrants apply for asylum; nearly five hundred thousand cases currently await adjudication, while hundreds of thousands more migrants now reside in Mexico without formal registration. None of the candidates has laid out plans to address the influx of migrants living in Mexico or cooperation with the United States, though migrants will continue to come.\n\nFinances. The next president will have less money to grapple with these challenges. While AMLO touts governmental austerity, his administration has been quite profligate. Budget deficits now approach 6 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) \u2014 levels not seen since the 1980s \u2014 even amid lagging public investments in roads, rails, airports, and border crossings. And the state-owned energy company Petr\u00f3leos Mexicanos, or Pemex, remains a financial albatross. AMLO injected over $90 billion in Pemex to keep it afloat, but it still owes more than $100 billion, making it the world\u2019s most indebted oil company. The global credit rating agency Moody\u2019s predicts that business as usual at Pemex will soon cost Mexico\u2019s treasury nearly $18 billion per year. Yet, restructuring Pemex remains politically fraught, making significant reforms difficult.\n\nHow could the results shape Mexico\u2019s relations with the United States?\n\nTrade. Mexico and the United States will each have an opportunity to shift and expand bilateral relations under their new administrations, after the U.S. election in November. Commercial issues loom large, including current disputes over energy and genetically modified corn. The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement is up for review in 2026, and all three countries must agree to keep the free trade accord going for the next sixteen years or the rules will become temporary, dependent on yearly agreements. Meanwhile, China will dominate trade discussions as the United States leans on its neighbors to join it in delinking strategic industries and protecting its electric vehicle and other markets from its geopolitical rival. More fundamentally, both Mexico and the United States have yet to make the most of North American supply chains and commerce in ways that increase the competitiveness of domestic industries and their resilience to geopolitical forces.\n\nSecurity. With Mexican-made fentanyl and other illicit drugs killing upward of one hundred thousand Americans each year, security cooperation needs a push. A new Mexican administration could revive diminished ties and return to broader intelligence sharing, money tracing, customs enforcement, police training and equipping, and other methods to address mutual safety and security concerns.\n\nMigration. Migration, too, will be a major focus, as people are on the move throughout the hemisphere and beyond. Here, the United States needs to get its own house in order and invest in the substantial number of judges, asylum officers, and other administrators needed to expeditiously and efficiently process migrant cases. It also can, and should, help Mexico amp up similar capabilities to ensure quicker and more-humane resolutions for the people whose lives depend on the outcomes.\n\nThis publication is part of the Diamonstein-Spielvogel Project on the Future of Democracy.\n\nThis article is republished from the Council on Foreign Relations.

        "text": "Why Mexico\u2019s election is more important than ever for the United States\nCNN \u2014\n\nWith more than 98 million eligible voters, some 70,000 candidates and over 20,000 public offices being contested, Mexico\u2019s general election on June 2 will be the largest in the country\u2019s history.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just the massive scale of the event that makes it so important in the eyes of observers across the border in the United States.\n\nFor the first time in history, the country looks set to elect its first female president. The two front-runners are both women \u2013 Claudia Sheinbaum, of the Morena party, who is backed by the governing coalition Sigamos Haciendo Historia, and X\u00f3chitl G\u00e1lvez, who is backed by an coalition of opposition parties.\n\nThe vote is also important because it falls in the same year as the US presidential election \u2013 something that happens only once every 12 years \u2013 and comes at a time of transition in the relationship between the two countries.\n\nXochitl Galvez, presidential candidate for an alliance of opposition parties, meets supporters in Mexico City on May 17.

Raquel Cunha/Reuters\n\n\u201cThe years when all the US wanted was a safe and stable Mexico are over. Now it is also interested in a country with good public policy,\u201d said Rafael Fern\u00e1ndez de Castro Medina, director of the Center for US-Mexico Studies at the University of California, San Diego, pointing to the increasing number of Latinos in the US and the two countries\u2019 growing ties.\n\nHere are a look at some of the biggest issues affecting the US-Mexico relationship that will be influenced by Sunday\u2019s vote:\n\nIt\u2019s the economy, stupid\n\nMexico became the United States\u2019 top trading partner last year, surpassing China and Canada.\n\nExperts say this is largely because geopolitical issues such as the pandemic, the legacy of Trump\u2019s trade war against China, and the war in Ukraine all encouraged near-shoring \u2013 the relocation of supply chains nearer to home \u2013 which boosted US imports from Mexico and its investment in the country.\n\nKey to facilitating this shift was the creation of the USMCA trade agreement, which came into effect in 2020 between Mexico, the United States and Canada.\n\n\u201cThe USMCA offered, in that favorable context, a legal regulatory framework that provided a lot of certainty to the three North American countries, and Mexico has seized the opportunities and strengthened its preferential tariffs to make this happen,\u201d explained Lila Abed, director of the Mexico Institute at the Wilson Center.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s not all been plain sailing. Mexico\u2019s compliance with the USMCA has been an issue of contention between the administration of Mexico\u2019s current President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador and those of both US President Joe Biden and his predecessor Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cThe next president of Mexico will have to deal with a series of legal disputes that the United States, supported by Canada, has filed within the framework of the USMCA,\u201d Abed points out.\n\n\u201cThese range from [L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s] ban on the import of transgenic corn for human consumption; the shift towards a nationalist energy policy, which has affected US investments in electricity and hydrocarbons, as well as the little importance given to clean energies,\u201d Abed said.\n\nAccording to Abed, whoever wins the Mexican presidency on June 2 will have to deal with a lawsuit filed by the United States on these issues. They will also have to renegotiate the agreement when it comes up for renewal in 2026.\n\nWorkers pack avocados for export at the Los Cerritos avocado group ranch in Ciudad Guzman, state of Jalisco, Mexico, February 10, 2023. Mexico became the United States\u2019 top trading partner in 2023. Ulises Ruiz/AFP/Getty Images\n\nMany analysts believe the US is currently playing down disputes over the USMCA in the hope that this can ease differences in other areas, both in domestic Mexican issues \u2013 such as alleged human rights violations, the government\u2019s treatment of journalists, and the increase in political assassinations \u2013 and bilateral concerns such as immigration and the drug trade.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very transactional. Mexico agreed to partially manage the immigration crisis in the US, keeping immigrants in Mexican territory and taking care of their deportation, in exchange for the United States not activating these lawsuits,\u201d said Raquel L\u00f3pez Portillo Maltos, executive secretary of the youth group of the Mexican Council on Foreign Relations (Comexi) think tank.\n\nJorge Alberto Schiavon Uriegas, vice president of the Center for Studies and Analysis on Mexico\u2019s Foreign Policy, said L\u00f3pez Obrador followed a quid pro quo policy towards both Trump and Biden, and this would possibly continue with Sheinbaum, if elected.\n\n\u201cMexico committed to addressing the two main Mexican issues affecting the United States and that will determine the next election: migration and fentanyl. In exchange, the United States dramatically reduced its criticism of Mexico\u2019s democratic and institutional weakness, and reduced its interventions, leaving more room for L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s domestic policy,\u201d said Schiavon Uriegas.\n\nMigration: Mexico, \u2018part of Trump\u2019s wall\u2019\n\nWhile migration across the countries\u2019 1,933 miles long border is a shared concern, the issue is much lower on Mexican politicians\u2019 agenda than in the US \u2014 where it could be a decisive factor in the November vote, according to Carin Zissis, editor-in-chief of the Americas Society/Council of the Americas website.\n\n\u201cThe speeches of Sheinbaum and G\u00e1lvez on migration are neither very strong nor very different from each other, nor do they address too much what to do with migrants in the country,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cProof of this is that, during the last presidential debate, when migration was addressed, the main angle was Mexican migrants currently living in the US; they were talking to their potential voters north of the border and to the Latino community in general, which is large and powerful due to remittances.\u201d\n\nThe rub for US politicians is that they need buy-in from their Mexican counterparts if their own immigration policies are to succeed.\n\nZissis gave the example of how Lopez Obrador had made Mexico \u201cpart of Trump\u2019s wall\u201d by sending \u201cthousands of members of the National Guard and the Army to take care of migration control.\u201d\n\n\u00a8Trump didn\u2019t have to build the wall because Mexico is the wall,\u201d said Zissis.\n\nA Mexican security guard is seen across the border in Piedras Negras, a city in Mexico, as immigrants wait to be processed at a US Border Patrol transit center after crossing the border at Eagle Pass, Texas, on December 22, 2023. Chandan Khanna/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAbed, of the Mexico Institute, said Mexico\u2019s next president would face a different conundrum to previous leaders, because the country had changed from being merely a transit country, which immigrants passed through on their way to the US, to being in many cases their final stop.\n\n\u201cThe reaction of the L\u00f3pez Obrador government has been to transport migrants who are waiting at the border between Mexico and the United States to the southeast of the country and leave them there. The migration authorities are overwhelmed, the Mexican Refugee Aid Commission (Comar) is also overwhelmed, the centers where migrants stay are very precarious, migrants \u2014 specifically unaccompanied minors and women, as well as young people \u2014 are at risk from organized crime and human traffickers, and their human rights could be violated,\u201d Abed detailed.\n\nShe said the next Mexican government will need to assume responsibility for this large migrant population, \u201cand decide whether to give them a temporary visa, whether to allow them to work, whether they will have access to medical services, etc.\u201d\n\nFentanyl and the drug trade\n\nSecurity is another pillar of the bilateral relationship, particularly in terms of the thriving cross-border drug trade that blights both countries.\n\nWhile the United States has been grappling with a domestic health crisis due to the amount of fentanyl on its streets, Mexico faces increasing cartel-linked violence \u2013 including in the run-up to the election which has been marred by dozens of assassination attempts and other political violence.\n\n\u201cM\u00e9xico has made progress in dismantling clandestine drug laboratories, but the next government must do more to stop the entry through maritime ports of precursor chemicals mostly coming from China, because after that is when they fall into the hands of organized crime to produce these synthetic opioids,\u201d Abed said.\n\n\u201cBut the United States also has to dismantle the network of traffickers within (its own borders). That is, once fentanyl arrives, its distribution throughout the territory is not magical. There is a significant network of organized crime in the United States that the administration must arrest, bring to trial, and whose activities it must restrict,\u201d she added.\n\nMexican Army and National Guard members take part in Operation Juarez, aimed at reducing violence in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, on February 17, 2024. Jose Luis Gonzalez/Reuters\n\nOne issue the US may be keen to revisit with whoever wins on June 2 are the reforms to Mexico\u2019s National Security Law that the L\u00f3pez Obrador government implemented in 2018 as one of its first measures, which limited the activity of foreign agents operating on Mexican territory.\n\n\u201cIt was a symbol, a sign that the Mexican government was not going to open the door so easily to security agencies such as the DEA, the CIA, and others. He removed the diplomatic immunity (and) they had to register all their activities with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, etc,\u201d explained Abed.\n\nExperts who spoke to CNN said, however, that much of L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s confrontational discourse with the United States was a facade that, at times, hid a well-oiled process of negotiations with both the Republican and Democratic administrations.\n\n\u201cL\u00f3pez Obrador often speaks to his Mexican base and then negotiates. He knows that the US needs him on migration and security matters,\u201d said Zissis at the Americas Society website.",

        "text": "The State of the American Middle Class\nWho is in it and key trends from 1970 to 2023\n\nHow we did this This report examines key changes in the economic status of the American middle class from 1970 to 2023 and its demographic attributes in 2022. The historical analysis is based on U.S. Census Bureau data from the Annual Social and Economic Supplements (ASEC) of the Current Population Survey (CPS). The demographic analysis is based on data from the American Community Survey (ACS). The data is sourced from IPUMS CPS and IPUMS USA, respectively. The CPS, a survey of about 60,000 households, is the U.S. government\u2019s official source for monthly estimates of unemployment. The CPS ASEC, conducted in March each year, is the official source of U.S. government estimates of income and poverty. Our analysis of CPS data starts with the 1971 CPS ASEC, which records the incomes of households in 1970. It is also the first year for which data on race and ethnicity is available. The latest available CPS ASEC file is for 2023, which reports on household incomes in 2022. The public-use version of the ACS is a 1% sample of the U.S. population, or more than 3 million people. This allows for a detailed study of the demographic characteristics of the middle class, including its status in U.S. metropolitan areas. But ACS data is available only from 2005 onward and is less suitable for long-term historical analyses. The latest available ACS data is for 2022.\n\nTerminology Middle-income households are defined as those with an income that is two-thirds to double that of the U.S. median household income, after incomes have been adjusted for household size. Lower-income households have incomes less than two-thirds of the median, and upper-income households have incomes that are more than double the median. When using American Community Survey (ACS) data, incomes are also adjusted for cost of living in the areas in which households are located. Estimates of household income are scaled to reflect a household size of three and expressed in 2023 dollars. In the Current Population Survey (CPS), household income refers to the calendar year prior to the survey year. Thus, the income data in the report refers to the 1970-2022 period, and the share of Americans in each income tier from the CPS refers to the 1971-2023 period. The demographic attributes of Americans living in lower-, middle- or upper-income tiers are derived from ACS data. Except as noted, estimates pertain to the U.S. household population, excluding people living in group quarters. The terms middle class and middle income are used interchangeably in this report. White, Black, Asian, American Indian or Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander include people who identified with a single major racial group and who are not Hispanic. Multiracial includes people who identified with more than one major racial group and are not Hispanic. Hispanics are of any race. U.S. born refers to individuals who are U.S. citizens at birth, including people born in the 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico or other U.S. territories, as well as those born elsewhere to at least one parent who is a U.S. citizen. The terms foreign born and immigrant are used interchangeably in this report. They refer to people who are not U.S. citizens at birth. Occupations describe the broad kinds of work people do on their job. For example, health care occupations include doctors, nurses, pharmacists and others who are directly engaged in the provision of health care. Industries describe the broad type of products companies produce. Each industry encompasses a variety of occupations. For example, the health care and social assistance industry provides services that are produced by a combination of doctors, managers, technology and administrative staff, food preparation workers, and workers in other occupations.\n\nThe share of Americans who are in the middle class is smaller than it used to be. In 1971, 61% of Americans lived in middle-class households. By 2023, the share had fallen to 51%, according to a new Pew Research Center analysis of government data.\n\nAs a result, Americans are more apart than before financially. From 1971 to 2023, the share of Americans who live in lower-income households increased from 27% to 30%, and the share in upper-income households increased from 11% to 19%.\n\nNotably, the increase in the share who are upper income was greater than the increase in the share who are lower income. In that sense, these changes are also a sign of economic progress overall.\n\nBut the middle class has fallen behind on two key counts. The growth in income for the middle class since 1970 has not kept pace with the growth in income for the upper-income tier. And the share of total U.S. household income held by the middle class has plunged.\n\nMoreover, many groups still lag in their presence in the middle- and upper-income tiers. For instance, American Indians or Alaska Natives, Black and Hispanic Americans, and people who are not married are more likely than average to be in the lower-income tier. Several metro areas in the U.S. Southwest also have high shares of residents who are in the lower-income tier, after adjusting for differences in cost of living across areas.\n\nOur report focuses on the current state of the American middle class. First, we examine changes in the financial well-being of the middle class and other income tiers since 1970. This is based on data from the Annual Social and Economic Supplements (ASEC) of the Current Population Survey (CPS), conducted from 1971 to 2023.\n\nThen, we report on the attributes of people who were more or less likely to be middle class in 2022. Our focus is on their race and ethnicity, age, gender, marital and veteran status, place of birth, ancestry, education, occupation, industry, and metropolitan area of residence. These estimates are derived from American Community Survey (ACS) data and differ slightly from the CPS-based estimates. In part, that is because incomes can be adjusted for the local area cost of living only with the ACS data. (Refer to the methodology for details on these two data sources.)\n\nThis analysis and an accompanying report on the Asian American middle class are, in part, updates of previous work by the Center. But they offer much greater detail on the demographic attributes of the American middle class.\n\nFollowing are some key facts about the state of the American middle class:\n\nWho is middle income or middle class? In our analysis, \u201cmiddle-income\u201d Americans are those living in households with an annual income that is two-thirds to double the national median household income. The income it takes to be middle income varies by household size, with smaller households requiring less to support the same lifestyle as larger households. It also varies by the local cost of living, with households in a more expensive area, such as Honolulu, needing a higher income than those in a less expensive area, such as Wichita, Kansas. We don\u2019t always know the area in which a household is located. In our two data sources \u2013 the Current Population Survey, Annual Social and Economic Supplement (CPS ASEC) and the American Community Survey (ACS) \u2013 only the latter provides that information, specifically the metropolitan area of a household. Thus, we aren\u2019t able to adjust for the local cost of living when using the CPS to track changes in the status of the middle class over time. But we do adjust for the metropolitan area cost of living when using the ACS to determine the demographic attributes of the middle class in 2022. In the 2023 CPS ASEC data, which reports income for 2022, middle-income households with three people have incomes ranging from about $61,000 to $183,000 annually. \u201cLower-income\u201d households have incomes less than $61,000, and \u201cupper-income\u201d households have incomes greater than $183,000. In the 2022 ACS data, middle-income households with three people have incomes ranging from about $62,000 to $187,000 annually, with incomes also adjusted for the local area cost of living. (Incomes are expressed in 2023 dollars.) The boundaries of the income tiers also vary across years as the national median income changes. The terms \u201cmiddle income\u201d and \u201cmiddle class\u201d are used interchangeably in this report for the sake of exposition. But being middle class can refer to more than just income, be it education level, type of profession, economic security, home ownership or social and political values. Class also could simply be a matter of self-identification.\n\nHouseholds in all income tiers had much higher incomes in 2022 than in 1970, after adjusting for inflation. But the gains for middle- and lower-income households were less than the gains for upper-income households.\n\nThe median income of middle-class households increased from about $66,400 in 1970 to $106,100 in 2022, or 60%. Over this period, the median income of upper-income households increased 78%, from about $144,100 to $256,900. (Incomes are scaled to a three-person household and expressed in 2023 dollars.)\n\nThe median income of lower-income households grew more slowly than that of other households, increasing from about $22,800 in 1970 to $35,300 in 2022, or 55%.\n\nConsequently, there is now a larger gap between the incomes of upper-income households and other households. In 2022, the median income of upper-income households was 7.3 times that of lower-income households, up from 6.3 in 1970. It was 2.4 times the median income of middle-income households in 2022, up from 2.2 in 1970.\n\nThe share of total U.S. household income held by the middle class has fallen almost without fail in each decade since 1970. In that year, middle-income households accounted for 62% of the aggregate income of all U.S. households, about the same as the share of people who lived in middle-class households.\n\nBy 2022, the middle-class share in overall household income had fallen to 43%, less than the share of the population in middle-class households (51%). Not only do a smaller share of people live in the middle class today, the incomes of middle-class households have also not risen as quickly as the incomes of upper-income households.\n\nOver the same period, the share of total U.S. household income held by upper-income households increased from 29% in 1970 to 48% in 2022. In part, this is because of the increase in the share of people who are in the upper-income tier.\n\nThe share of overall income held by lower-income households edged down from 10% in 1970 to 8% in 2022. This happened even though the share of people living in lower-income households increased over this period.\n\nThe share of people in the U.S. middle class varied from 46% to 55% across racial and ethnic groups in 2022. Black and Hispanic Americans, Native Hawaiians or Pacific Islanders, and American Indians or Alaska Natives were more likely than others to be in lower-income households.\n\nIn 2022, 39% to 47% of Americans in these four groups lived in lower-income households. In contrast, only 24% of White and Asian Americans and 31% of multiracial Americans were in the lower-income tier.\n\nAt the other end of the economic spectrum, 27% of Asian and 21% of White Americans lived in upper-income households in 2022, compared with about 10% or less of Black and Hispanic Americans, Native Hawaiians or Pacific Islanders, and American Indians or Alaska Natives.\n\nNot surprisingly, lower-income status is correlated with the likelihood of living in poverty. According to the Census Bureau, the poverty rate among Black (17.1%) and Hispanic (16.9%) Americans and American Indians or Alaska Natives (25%) was greater than the rate among White and Asian Americans (8.6% for each). (The Census Bureau did not report the poverty rate for Native Hawaiians or Pacific Islanders.)\n\nChildren and adults 65 and older were more likely to live in lower-income households in 2022. Adults in the peak of their working years \u2013 ages 30 to 64 \u2013 were more likely to be upper income. In 2022, 38% of children (including teens) and 35% of adults 65 and older were lower income, compared with 26% of adults ages 30 to 44 and 23% of adults 45 to 64.\n\nThe share of people living in upper-income households ranged from 13% among children and young adults (up to age 29) to 24% among those 45 to 64. In each age group, about half or a little more were middle class in 2022.\n\nMen were slightly more likely than women to live in middle-income households in 2022, 53% vs. 51%. Their share in upper-income households (18%) was also somewhat greater than the share of women (16%) in upper-income households.\n\nMarriage appears to boost the economic status of Americans. Among those who were married in 2022, eight-in-ten lived either in middle-income households (56%) or upper-income households (24%). In contrast, only about six-in-ten of those who were separated, divorced, widowed or never married were either middle class or upper income, while 37% lived in lower-income households.\n\nVeterans were more likely than nonveterans to be middle income in 2022, 57% vs. 53%. Conversely, a higher share of nonveterans (29%) than veterans (24%) lived in lower-income households.\n\nImmigrants \u2013 about 14% of the U.S. population in 2022 \u2013 were less likely than the U.S. born to be in the middle class and more likely to live in lower-income households. In 2022, more than a third of immigrants (36%) lived in lower-income households, compared with 29% of the U.S. born. Immigrants also trailed the U.S. born in the shares who were in the middle class, 48% vs. 53%.\n\nThere are large gaps in the economic status of American residents by their region of birth. Among people born in Asia, Europe or Oceania, 25% lived in upper-income households in 2022. People from these regions represented 7% of the U.S. population.\n\nBy comparison, only 14% of people born in Africa or South America and 6% of those born in Central America and the Caribbean were in the upper-income tier in 2022. Together they accounted for 8% of the U.S. population.\n\nThe likelihood of being in the middle class or the upper-income tier varies considerably with the ancestry of Americans. In 2022, Americans reporting South Asian ancestry were about as likely to be upper income (38%) as they were to be middle income (42%). Only 20% of Americans of South Asian origin lived in lower-income households. South Asians accounted for about 2% of the U.S. population of known origin groups in 2022.\n\nAt least with respect to the share who were lower income, this was about matched by those with Soviet, Eastern European, other Asian or Western European origins. These groups represented the majority (54%) of the population of Americans whose ancestry was known in 2022.\n\nOn the other hand, only 7% of Americans with Central and South American or other Hispanic ancestry were in the upper-income tier, and 44% were lower income. The economic statuses of Americans with Caribbean, sub-Saharan African or North American ancestry were not very different from this.\n\nEducation matters for moving into the middle class and beyond, and so do jobs. Among Americans ages 25 and older in 2022, 52% of those with a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher level of education lived in middle-class households and another 35% lived in upper-income households.\n\nIn sharp contrast, 42% of Americans who did not graduate from high school were in the middle class, and only 5% were in the upper-income tier. Further, only 12% of college graduates were lower income, compared with 54% of those who did not complete high school.\n\nNot surprisingly, having a job is strongly linked to movement from the lower-income tier to the middle- and upper-income tiers. Among employed American workers ages 16 and older, 58% were in the middle-income tier in 2022 and 23% were in the upper-income tier. Only 19% of employed workers were lower income, compared with 49% of unemployed Americans.\n\nIn some occupations, about nine-in-ten U.S. workers are either in the middle class or in the upper-income tier, but in some other occupations almost four-in-ten workers are lower income. More than a third (36% to 39%) of workers in computer, science and engineering, management, and business and finance occupations lived in upper-income households in 2022. About half or more were in the middle class.\n\nBut many workers \u2013 about one-third or more \u2013 in construction, transportation, food preparation and serving, and personal care and other services were in the lower-income tier in 2022.\n\nAbout six-in-ten workers or more in education; protective and building maintenance services; office and administrative support; the armed forces; and maintenance, repair and production were in the middle class.\n\nDepending on the industrial sector, anywhere from half to two-thirds of U.S. workers were in the middle class, and the share who are upper income or lower income varied greatly.\n\nAbout a third of workers in the finance, insurance and real estate, information, and professional services sectors were in the upper-income tier in 2022. Nearly nine-in-ten workers (87%) in public administration \u2013 largely filling legislative functions and providing federal, state or local government services \u2013 were either in the middle class or the upper-income tier.\n\nBut nearly four-in-ten workers (38%) in accommodation and food services were lower income in 2022, along with three-in-ten workers in the retail trade and other services sectors.\n\nThe share of Americans who are in the middle class or in the upper- or lower-income tier differs across U.S. metropolitan areas. But a pattern emerges when it comes to which metro areas have the highest shares of people living in lower-, middle- or upper-income households. (We first adjust household incomes for differences in the cost of living across areas.)\n\nThe 10 metropolitan areas with the greatest shares of middle-income residents are small to midsize in population and are located mostly in the northern half of the U.S. About six-in-ten residents in these metro areas were in the middle class.\n\nSeveral of these areas are in the so-called Rust Belt, namely, Wausau and Oshkosh-Neenah, both in Wisconsin; Grand Rapids-Wyoming, Michigan; and Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Two others \u2013 Dover and Olympia-Tumwater \u2013 include state capitals (Delaware and Washington, respectively).\n\nIn four of these areas \u2013 Bismarck, North Dakota, Ogden-Clearfield, Utah, Lancaster and Wausau \u2013 the share of residents in the upper-income tier ranged from 18% to 20%, about on par with the share nationally.\n\nThe 10 U.S. metropolitan areas with the highest shares of residents in the upper-income tier are mostly large, coastal communities. Topping the list is San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, California, a technology-driven economy, in which 40% of the population lived in upper-income households in 2022. Other tech-focused areas on this list include San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward; Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue; and Raleigh, North Carolina.\n\nBridgeport-Stamford-Norwalk, Connecticut, is a financial hub. Several areas, including Washington, D.C.-Arlington-Alexandria and Boston-Cambridge-Newton, are home to major universities, leading research facilities and the government sector.\n\nNotably, many of these metro areas also have sizable lower-income populations. For instance, about a quarter of the populations in Bridgeport-Stamford-Norwalk; Trenton, New Jersey; Boston-Cambridge-Newton; and Santa Cruz-Watsonville, California, were in the lower-income tier in 2022.\n\nMost of the 10 U.S. metropolitan areas with the highest shares of residents in the lower-income tier are in the Southwest, either on the southern border of Texas or in California\u2019s Central Valley. The shares of people living in lower-income residents were largely similar across these areas, ranging from about 45% to 50%.\n\nAbout 40% to 50% of residents in these metro areas were in the middle class, and only about one-in-ten or fewer lived in upper-income households.\n\nCompared with the nation overall, the lower-income metro areas in Texas and California have disproportionately large Hispanic populations. The two metro areas in Louisiana \u2013 Monroe and Shreveport-Bossier City \u2013 have disproportionately large Black populations.\n\nNote: For details on how this analysis was conducted, refer to the methodology.",

        "text": "It's not just young voters. New citizens will head to the polls this year, too\nIt's not just young voters. New citizens will head to the polls this year, too\n\ntoggle caption Patrick T. Fallon/AFP via Getty Images\n\nMillions of Americans can vote for the first time in the general election this fall, and while the majority of those will be voters just aging into eligibility \u2013 it\u2019s a group that also includes new U.S. citizens spanning across generations.\n\nAn estimated 3.5 million adults of voting age have been naturalized in the U.S. since the 2020 election, according to data from the U.S. Immigration Policy Center at the University of California San Diego, with over a third from Asia, followed closely by North and Central America and nearly 11% from Africa.\n\nNew citizen voters are a group that advocates say could wield political power in the presidential race, especially in key swing states with sizable immigrant populations and where just a small portion of votes can determine a winner. That said, with lower levels of recorded turnout compared to U.S.-born voters, challenges remain in getting new citizens to show up to the polls.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cI'm not sure if this is a population that thinks of itself as, \u2018we are a bloc of voters,\u2019 in the way we oftentimes talk about Latino voters or Black voters or Asian voters,\u201d said Mark Hugo Lopez, the director of race and ethnicity research at Pew Research Center. \u201cBut it is a notably growing group.\u201d\n\nIn a new poll commissioned by the National Partnership for New Americans (NPNA), looking at naturalized voter attitudes, issues related to the economy rank as most important. The survey, conducted with the U.S. Immigration Policy Center, which polled individuals in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Florida, California and Texas, found the issue of immigration comes immediately after economic concerns.\n\n\u201cNew American voters care about the same things that U.S.-born voters care about,\u201d said NPNA executive director Nicole Melaku.\n\n\n\nA potentially influential vote\n\nNaturalization rates in some battleground states, including Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Nevada and Wisconsin surpassed each state\u2019s 2020 presidential vote margin. In Arizona, new citizens who became naturalized from 2016 to 2020 totaled more than six times the vote margin in the state four years ago.\n\n\u201cYou look at the math there, and you can ascertain that if people were engaged, they would have a decisive impact in the election,\u201d Melaku said. \u201cYou can take any part of the country, and you can see what role immigrants and naturalized voters would play in this year's election.\u201d\n\nSponsor Message\n\nDespite naturalization data, it\u2019s unclear how much of the population is registered to vote. The U.S. Census does not keep data on the number of newly naturalized citizens who registered to vote.\n\nLoading...\n\nThough naturalized voters trail U.S.-born voters in overall turnout, when it\u2019s broken down by race and ethnicity, naturalized citizens of Asian or Hispanic origin cast ballots at higher rates than individuals with those backgrounds born in the U.S., according to Pew Research Center.\n\nAlthough advocates point to the potential of these immigrant voters, 2024 trends fall in line with what experts have noted in past cycles, said Lopez of Pew Research Center.\n\n\"We have generally seen the size of the eligible voter pool of naturalized citizens keep pace with [the] growth of the general eligible voter population of the United States,\" he explained.\n\n\u201cIn 2020, naturalized citizens made up 10% of eligible voters. In 2024, it's likely to be about the same,\u201d Lopez predicted.\n\n\n\nThe politics of new voters depends on the state\n\nNew citizens are part of different racial and economic groups around the country that hold a wide range of political beliefs.\n\nWhile Asian Americans and Latinos have broadly trended Democratic, it\u2019s changing within some communities. Lopez notably pointed to the growing conservative Latino population in south Florida, seen as a swing state less than a decade ago, now expected to go easily for former President Trump.\n\nAnd party identification continues to be fairly split. In the latest NPNA survey, more than a third of naturalized voters in Florida and Michigan identify as Republican, while about 40% do in Georgia and Texas.\n\nAt the same time, over 40% of naturalized voters in Nevada, Arizona and Georgia call themselves Democrats, as well as more than a third of voters in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Florida. When including voters who lean Democrat, the number in each of these states, excluding Texas, climbs to nearly half.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBoth President Biden and Trump are attempting to court voter populations that include newly naturalized citizens. In 2020, Biden won among Latino and Asian Americans, but Democrats lost ground with Hispanic voters in the midterms.\n\nBiden\u2019s approval also dipped with Latinos in an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll published in April.\n\nTo Nicole Melaku of NPNA, engaging these new citizen populations could have widespread political influence \u2013 but she argued politicians often fail to prioritize outreach to immigrant communities.\n\n\u201cI feel like new American voters\u2026 the messages aren't resonating, or there aren't enough engagement opportunities with the candidates,\" she said.\n\n\u201cPeople just tend to lump immigrants in one category of like people that are hard to reach.\u201d",

        "summary": " The framers of the Constitution chose just three qualifications for the office of U.S. president . There are just three basic qualifications for being president: Age, Citizenship and Residency . The president is the only federal officer who is required to have lived in the U.",
        "text": "What Are the Qualifications to Be President of the United States?\nWhen the United States Constitution was being drafted and ratified, the Founders debated over what qualifications to impose on the nation\u2019s highest offices. Some delegates argued that members of Congress shouldn\u2019t be debtors or foreign-born. Others insisted that all federal officers should be landowners. A few believed there should be almost no qualifications or restrictions on who holds a federal office\u2014that the voters should decide who is best equipped.\n\nIn the end, the framers of the Constitution chose to include just three qualifications for the office of U.S. president. They\u2019re laid out in Article II, Section 1, Clause 5:\n\nNo Person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President; neither shall any Person be eligible to that Office who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty five Years, and been fourteen Years a Resident within the United States.\n\nAmerica 101: What Qualifications Do You Need to Be President?\n\nUnlike European aristocracies, where only wealthy landed gentlemen could rule, America\u2019s Constitution imposed no financial requirements or religious tests on who was fit for office.\n\n\u201cIn the ratifying conventions, there were people who said, \u2018You mean somebody who is poor, or somebody who is not a Christian, or somebody who doesn\u2019t hold any land can become president of the United States?\u2019 It was a little bizarre to think that anyone could serve,\u201d says Derek Muller, an election law professor at the University of Notre Dame Law School. \u201cThe notion was that these were some bare minimums. They expected that the people who voted\u2014or the electors who voted for president\u2014would exercise their judgment about who had the appropriate qualifications.\u201d\n\nBasic Qualifications: Age, Citizenship and Residency\n\nAccording to the Constitution, there are just three basic qualifications for being president:\n\nAge: The person must be at least 35 years old Citizenship: The person must be a \u201cnatural born citizen,\u201d meaning they were either born on American soil or born abroad to American parents. The president cannot become an American citizen through the naturalization process. Residency: The person has lived in the U.S. at least 14 years\n\nAt the Constitutional Convention in 1787, the Founders debated the minimum age for federal officers, with George Mason proposing 25 for members of the House and James Wilson arguing that there shouldn\u2019t be any age restrictions at all. James Madison, in his minutes of the Convention, reported Wilson saying, \u201cThere was no more reason for incapacitating youth than age, when the requisite qualifications were found.\u201d\n\nIn the end, the Founders settled on three different minimum ages: 25 for the House, 30 for the Senate and 35 for the presidency (and vice presidency). Muller says the president\u2019s minimum age must be met by Inauguration Day. A 34-year-old could be elected president in November of an election year, but they\u2019d need to turn 35 before January 20 to take office.\n\nThe Founders universally supported a citizenship requirement, and there wouldn\u2019t have been any confusion about what it meant to be a \u201cnatural born\u201d citizen. That language was common in 18th-century British law, which recognized all children born to British parents as \u201cnatural-born subjects,\u201d even if they were born outside the British Empire.\n\nNote that the framers were careful to include the clause \u201c\u200b\u200bat the time of the Adoption of this Constitution,\u201d to waive the \u201cnatural-born\u201d requirement for prominent delegates like Robert Morris and James Wilson, who were born to British parents outside of the American Colonies (England and Scotland respectively).\n\nThe president is the only federal officer who is required to have lived in the U.S. a specific number of years. (House members and Senators only have to be residents of the states they represent.) In explaining the logic of the Founders, Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story wrote that the 14-year residency ensured that \u201cthe people may have a full opportunity to know [the candidate\u2019s] character and merits, and that he may have mingled in the duties, and felt the interests, and understood the principles, and nourished the attachments, belonging to every citizen in a republican government.\u201d\n\nImpeachment and Conviction\n\nArticle II, Section 4 of the Constitution states that a president or other federal officials can be impeached and removed from office if convicted (by Congress) of \u201cTreason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.\u201d\n\nOnly three U.S. presidents have been impeached\u2014Andrew Johnson, Bill Clinton and Donald Trump (twice)\u2014but none was convicted and removed. If they had been convicted, though, could they run again for president and serve another term?\n\nThe short answer is \u201cno.\u201d Article I, Section 3, Clause 7 of the Constitution states (in part): \u201cJudgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States.\u201d\n\nHowever, Constitutional scholars debate the scope of the impeachment disqualification clause. To the Framers, the phrase \u201cany Office \u2026 under the United States\u201d did not apply to any state positions, so an impeached and convicted president could still hold any state position, says Seth Barrett Tillman, an American law professor at the Maynooth University School of Law and Criminology in Ireland.\n\nSome scholars, including Tillman, believe that the impeachment disqualification clause only applies to appointed positions, not elected office. According to that reading of the Constitution\u2014which Tillman admits is a minority\u2014an impeached and convicted president could be re-elected to the White House. It would ultimately be up to the Supreme Court to decide.\n\nTwo More Disqualifications: Term Limits and Insurrection\n\nMuller says that the Constitution mentions two other situations in which people would be disqualified or barred from being president. Both are found in constitutional amendments.\n\nThe 22nd Amendment, ratified in 1951, formally imposed a two-term limit on U.S. presidents. Starting with George Washington, all American presidents stepped down after two terms (if re-elected). That custom was broken by Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was re-elected to historic third and fourth terms in 1940 and 1944, as America was embroiled in World War II.\n\nAmerica 101: Why Do We Have Presidential Term Limits?\n\nLegislators passed the 22nd Amendment to prevent future presidents from trying to beat FDR\u2019s record of 12 years in office. That\u2019s why former presidents who served two full terms are disqualified from serving again. (Interestingly, the wording of the 22nd Amendment says that no person can be \u201celected\u201d more than twice for president, but it doesn\u2019t explicitly prevent a former two-term president from ascending to a third term via the vice presidency.)\n\nThe Constitution\u2019s only other disqualification for the presidency came in 1868, in the wake of the Civil War, when lawmakers sought to prevent former Confederate officers from occupying seats in the U.S. Congress and state legislatures. Section 3 of the 14th Amendment states:\n\nNo person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice-President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability.\n\nLawmakers successfully employed Section 3 in the 1860s to prevent former Confederates from blocking Reconstruction legislation. But by 1872, President Ulysses S. Grant was under pressure to lift the ban on former Confederates, which he did\u2014with the General Amnesty Act of 1872. After that, Section 3 of the 14th Amendment sat on the shelf for nearly 150 years.\n\nCriminal Convictions and Jail Sentences are Not Disqualifiers\n\nWhen it comes to eligibility for the nation\u2019s highest office, the founding document makes no mention of the issue of criminal convictions. Nothing prevents a person convicted of multiple felonies or other criminal charges from becoming president.\n\n\u201cThe Constitution does not list those things out,\u201d says Muller. \u201cVoters can certainly take that into consideration, but that\u2019s a different matter from saying that you\u2019re barred from holding office.\u201d\n\nTechnically, there\u2019s nothing in the Constitution or its amendments that says a president couldn\u2019t perform their duties from prison, either. In the 1920 presidential election, the socialist candidate Eugene Debs ran his campaign from a federal prison in Georgia, where he was serving a 10-year sentence for sedition. Debs ran as \"Convict No. 9653\u201d and won 3.5 percent of the vote.",

Debs won 3.4% of the popular vote while in prison on sedition charges for speaking out against the World War I draft.\n\nCould he still vote?\n\nYes, unless he's in prison.\n\nThough Florida -- where Trump is registered to vote -- prohibits people convicted of felonies from voting until their sentence is complete, New York law will allow him to maintain his voting rights.\n\nIn New York, felons are only barred from voting if they are currently incarcerated, and voting rights are automatically restored upon their release from prison.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump speaks with reporters after being found guilty on all counts in New York, May 30, 2024. ABC News\n\nFlorida law states that felons are ineligible to vote \"only if the conviction would make the person ineligible to vote in the state where the person was convicted,\" thus clearing the way for Trump to cast his ballot in November -- as long as he's not behind bars at that point, in which case, he would be legally prohibited from voting.\n\nCould Trump own a gun?\n\nProbably not. Under both federal law and New York state law, people convicted of felonies cannot legally possess firearms.\n\nBut Trump -- who in 2012 told the Washington Times he had a concealed-carry permit and owned several guns -- could eventually get that ban reversed.\n\n\"He could seek to have that right restored, since his conviction was for a lower level non-violent felony,\" Cheryl Bader, a professor at Fordham Law, told ABC News.\n\nCould he travel internationally?\n\nProbably, but possibly not to some particular countries.\n\nAs part of sentencing, a judge may impose travel restrictions, but that's usually only done when there's concern that the person might flee. \"I would be surprised if Judge Merchan will feel that travel restrictions are necessary as Trump is not a flight risk,\" Bader said.\n\nHowever, there are a number of countries -- including Canada, China and the U.K. -- that refuse entry to foreign visitors who've been convicted of crimes. Even so, it's not such a black-and-white rule, and is often decided on a case-by-case basis depending on the nature of the crime.\n\n\"These laws could cause Trump problems depending on what happens with his sentence and whether a particular country bans people convicted of a comparable crime ... [but] governments of these countries likely have some discretion to waive the prohibition.\" Betsy Ginsberg, a professor at Cardozo Law, told ABC News.",

The history professor at the American University in Washington has earned the title of living Nostradamus by making certain predictions that as he claims, have proved correct. Now, he has said that President Joe Biden has an edge over the former president. This is significant because Allan Lichtman has predicted the outcome of almost every US presidential election since 1984.According to the American University website, the living Nostradamus has used the method he dubbed \" 13 Keys to the White House .\" According to the official website, the 13 keys are simple to use- if 8 or more of the 13 keys are true for the incumbent party, its candidate will win the election, but if fewer than 8 are true, the challenger will win. Michel de Nostredame , better known as Nostradamus, was a French astrologer, who made several prophesies , that were proved correct over some time. Born in December 1503, he published his book ' Les Propheties ' in 1555. It was an anthology of 942 poetic quatrains. Many people believe that these quatrains were predictions.Many people believe that Nostradamus predicted the Great Fire of London, the French Revolution, the rise of Napoleon and Adolf Hitler, World War I and World War II, and the nuclear destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. He also predicted some modern-day events like the Apollo Moon landing in 1969, the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster in 1986, the death of Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997, and the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center in 2001.A history professor at the American University in Washington, Allan Lichtman, has earned the title of living Nostradamus by making certain predictions that as he claims, have proved correct.Michel de Nostredame, better known as Nostradamus, was a French astrologer, who made several prophesies, that were proved correct over some time.

        "text": "War, AI and more war: the 2024 Bilderberg agenda is sure to set off alarm bells\nThis year the Bilderberg summit, now under way in Madrid, turned 70 years old. But the controversial and secretive gathering of the world\u2019s elites shows no signs of slowing down.\n\nFor decades the Bilderberg meeting, where the rich and the powerful gather behind closed doors to talk about what ails the world, has been the subject \u2013 understandably \u2013 of conspiracy theories. In recent years, Bilderberg has sought to remake itself and open up a little: more Davos than Illuminati.\n\nBut it still raises hackles from many observers. Its beady eyes, twinkling with billionaires, are this year fixed firmly on the future. Specifically, the \u201cfuture of warfare\u201d. And with conflicts raging from Sudan to Ukraine to Gaza, it feels like it is the spirit of the age.\n\nThis grim subject is being thrashed out under the hum of police drones hovering over the hotel, making sure such luminaries as the king of the Netherlands and the head of Nato are safe inside. Even by Bilderberg standards, the security at this year\u2019s conference is intense, but it managed to gear up even more when the Spanish king\u2019s entourage swept into the venue past a traffic jam of police vans.\n\nThe heightened security is perhaps a reflection of the threats and \u201cchallenges\u201d packed into the conference agenda: Russia, China, the Middle East, the climate \u2013 while the session on Ukraine, titled Ukraine and the World, has a worrying hint of a wider world war. And when the topic of the Changing Faces of Biology is being discussed by the CEO of Pfizer, the head of the EU Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, and the man who led the Human Genome Project, you can almost hear the alarm bells over the police sirens.\n\nThe world of Bilderberg in 2024 throbs with threats; it\u2019s what conference participant Alexander Stubb, the president of Finland, recently described as \u201cthe weaponisation of everything\u201d. It\u2019s a world of \u201chybrid attacks\u201d driven by disruptive technologies such as artificial intelligence. There\u2019s even a session on AI safety at this year\u2019s gathering, one of two sessions devoted to AI, securing its place at the head of Bilderberg\u2019s agenda.\n\nThe conference hall is heaving with tech luminaries, including the heads of Google DeepMind, Microsoft AI, Mistral AI and Anthropic, making the event a high-level AI summit in its own right.\n\nMany of these AI chiefs are tech optimists; Demis Hassabis, the CEO of Google DeepMind, recently raved about AI \u201cspreading consciousness to the stars\u201d. But the contingent of US national security officials, who have flowed in from Washington for these talks, tend to take a more worldly and weaponised view of the subject. They\u2019re led by the deputy national security adviser, Jonathan Finer, and Jen Easterly, the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. They are joined by one of the US\u2019s most senior soldiers, the supreme allied commander Europe, Christopher Cavoli, who warned recently that the conflict with Russia was shaping up to be a \u201clong fight\u201d. So the immediate future of war sounds like it\u2019ll be more war.\n\nIt\u2019s just sad that Henry Kissinger isn\u2019t here to enjoy it. The elder statesman of Bilderberg died in November at the age of 100.\n\nView image in fullscreen Henry Kissinger in 2008. Photograph: Shaun Best/Reuters\n\nCertainly the world\u2019s military \u2013 and the industries that surround it \u2013 take Bilderberg seriously. Gen Cavoli is taking time out from leading a \u201cwholesale modernization\u201d of Nato\u2019s defense capabilities to attend the Madrid conference. His boss at Nato, Jens Stoltenberg, is attending his last Bilderberg as secretary general. His successor is hotly tipped to be Mark Rutte, the outgoing Dutch prime minister. Rutte is a Bilderberg regular, and doubtless the group will be delighted, though perhaps not surprised, if yet another of their charmed circle lands a top job.\n\nThe other prime minister here in Madrid is Estonia\u2019s Kaja Kallas, who said recently that \u201copenness is our greatest weapon\u201d in free societies. \u201cAt its core,\u201d she said, \u201copenness represents getting rid of barriers that hinder the flow of information.\u201d\n\nSadly, we won\u2019t know if she talks at Bilderberg about openness, because of all the barriers hindering the flow of information. We do know that Kallas believes that on the battlefield, \u201cUkraine has out-innovated Russia, fielding entirely new weapons systems\u201d \u2013 some of which will have been developed by the tech companies at this year\u2019s conference.\n\nTime magazine has dubbed Ukraine \u201can AI war lab\u201d, and the Economist agrees, describing it as \u201ca testing ground for companies like Anduril and Palantir\u201d \u2013 the heads of both of these defense tech companies are here in Madrid.\n\nThe founder of Anduril Industries is Palmer Luckey, the designer of Oculus VR, who got bored of making headsets and wanted to build autonomous combat vehicles instead \u2013 so in 2017 he set up the defense contractor Anduril Industries, with investment from Founders Fund, which is run by the venture capitalist and Bilderberg insider Peter Thiel. Another of Thiel\u2019s happy investments was in Palantir \u2013 the AI surveillance giant run by Alex Karp, who sits alongside his mentor, Thiel, on Bilderberg\u2019s steering committee.\n\nWar is a fantastic opportunity for R&D; as Karp says: \u201cThere are things that we can do on the battlefield that we could not do in a domestic context.\u201d Meanwhile in Palestine, Palantir technology is being used by the IDF \u201cin support of war-related missions\u201d. The onslaught has been excellent for the company\u2019s bottom line. \u201cOur products have been in great demand,\u201d enthuses Karp.\n\nView image in fullscreen Peter Thiel, pictured in 2019, is sure to discuss the ongoing conflicts across the globe \u2013 from which he has profited handsomely \u2013 while at Bilderberg. Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nKarp\u2019s fellow Bilderberg insider and Pentagon favourite Eric Schmidt, who used to run Google, is said by Forbes magazine to have been so \u201cinspired by Ukraine\u2019s use of drones on the battlefield\u201d that he has spent the past year \u201cworking on a secret military drone project\u201d.\n\nBut for now, if Ukraine is to win the drone war, Schmidt says that it needs \u201csustained financial and technical support from Kyiv\u2019s allies\u201d. This sentiment will surely be echoed by Ukraine\u2019s representative at the Madrid conference, the foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, who will no doubt be doing his best to coax some extra billions out of the crowd.\n\nThis year\u2019s Bilderberg is thick with senior ministers and EU commissioners, not to mention the heads of the European Investment Bank and the Bank of Spain. The event itself is being hosted by Ana Bot\u00edn, the executive chair of Banco Santander, and the heads of numerous other finance giants are attending, including Citigroup, Deutsche Bank and Societ\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\n\nBig business tends to pick up the tab for Bilderberg, because it\u2019s such a high-end investment opportunity. Bilderberg is the boardroom of the western alliance, so they get to participate in the shaping of the grand strategy and hopefully get a jump on the market.\n\nIt\u2019s looking like next year\u2019s host will be the Swedish billionaire investor Marcus Wallenberg, the chairman of defense company Saab. His senior adviser, Oscar Stenstr\u00f6m, has been hovering round the venue as a member of the conference \u201cpre-team\u201d. Stenstr\u00f6m was the chief negotiator for Sweden\u2019s successful accession to Nato in March, and what better way to toast the ongoing expansion of the Alliance than with a Scandinavian Bilderberg.

        "text": "2024 US presidential election: 'The current electoral system encourages doubt and controversy over results'\nThe news went unnoticed, but it was significant. On April 15, Maine became the 17th American state to join the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact (NPVIC), an agreement by which signatories pledge to prevent a candidate from being declared the winner of the presidential election without having won a majority of votes nationwide. Such a configuration has occurred five times in American history: in 1824, 1876, 1888, 2000, and 2016.\n\nIn each state, when voters check the box for their preferred presidential candidate, they are actually electing a list of electors, whose number is equal to that state's number of seats in Congress. To be elected president, a candidate must receive at least 270 votes in the Electoral College: Half plus one of the 538 members of the Electoral College. Since each state has two senators, regardless of population size, not all votes are equal.\n\nThe NPVIC aims to remedy this anomaly. In a country where any change to the Constitution is destined to fail, the idea of a voluntary compact would bypass the ratification hurdle. The agreement would be activated when the 270-vote threshold is reached.\n\nPopular idea\n\nThanks to Maine (with four electors) and Minnesota (10), the Compact now has 209 votes in 17 states, plus the District of Columbia (three electors). Its supporters acknowledge that the road ahead is long, but they point out that the Compact, launched in 2006, represented just 134 votes 10 years ago. Born of the work of three eminent constitutional law experts after the defeat of Democrat Al Gore in 2000, the idea is rather popular. In 2020, Colorado voters were asked to decide whether their state should join, and 52% of them approved.\n\nThere's no shortage of arguments in favor of the popular vote. In 2016, Trump won 304 Electoral College votes to Hillary Clinton's 227. He was declared the winner even though she led him in the national popular vote by 2,868,686 votes. The same thing happened in 2000 when the Supreme Court gave George W. Bush victory in Florida \u2013 and therefore the presidency \u2013 by interrupting the recount of votes in the state. Gore, his rival, was ahead of him by more than 500,000 votes nationally. Incidentally, Bush was the last Republican to win the popular vote, in 2004.\n\nAccording to the calculations of advocates for the popular vote, it would only have taken 21,461 voters changing their minds for Biden to be defeated in 2020 (5,229 in Arizona, 5,890 in Georgia and 10,342 in Wisconsin), even though he had gathered a total of 7 million more votes than Trump. Supporters of the reform argue that the current system encourages doubt, controversy over results and post-election disputes.\n\nYou have 24.48% of this article left to read.

        "text": "South of the border, a woman is poised to take power in historic Mexico elections\nThe U.S. tried and failed, and now Mexico is getting there first.\n\nIn an historic election on Sunday, Mexican voters are expected to elect a woman \u2212 most likely a woman of Jewish ancestry \u2212 to lead the country, beating its neighboring ally and sometimes competitor, the United States, to that distinction.\n\nClaudia Sheinbaum is favored to win and become the next negotiator-in-chief with the U.S. on issues from cross-border trade to immigration and drug and fentanyl trafficking, with consequences that inevitably spill into American households.\n\nHere's what to know about election day in Mexico, and the woman likely to win.\n\nA woman will likely become president of Mexico\n\nIt's a three-way presidential race with a clear front-runner: Claudia Sheinbaum, a scientist, engineer and former mayor of Mexico City who shares the populist ideology of her political mentor, current President Andre\u0301s Manuel Lo\u0301pez Obrador.\n\nXo\u0301chitl Ga\u0301lvez, a businesswoman and former senator, is trailing second place in polls, all but ensuring that Mexico will elect a female head of state before the U.S. does. Jorge A\u0301lvarez Ma\u0301ynez is the third candidate.\n\n\"So many things that happen in Mexico don\u2019t stay in Mexico; they influence the United States,\" said Shannon O'Neil, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. \"Who the next president of Mexico is really matters.\"\n\nPolitical rhetoric north of the border may leave some Americans thinking of Mexico in stereotypes and caricatures: former President Donald Trump's \"bad hombres,\" or spring breakers. But Mexico\u2019s stamp on the U.S. is everywhere.\n\nIt\u2019s in the Mexico-made car parts that keep U.S. autoworkers employed in Detroit, in the windmill blades exported to U.S. clean energy plants, in the pacemakers saving the lives of American patients with heart failure and in the $15 avocado toast on restaurant menus nationwide.\n\nThe country became the United States\u2019 largest trading partner last year, pushing China to the No. 2 spot, and the two neighbors now do nearly $800 billion in trade annually, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nBut it\u2019s a fraught relationship. Mexico is also the transit country for hundreds of thousands of U.S.-bound migrants, provoking repeated humanitarian crises at the U.S. border. And it\u2019s the source country for the fentanyl that kills tens of thousands of Americans each year.\n\n\"If you have a president that is open to the United States and cooperating on the shared challenges and doubling down on the opportunities,\" O'Neil said, \"that is better for the United States. If you have a president who is more suspicious and doesn\u2019t want to work with the United States, then it\u2019s much harder.\"\n\nFrontrunner Claudia Sheinbaum calls out racism, 'machismo'\n\nSheinbaum, who has been leading in polls by double-digits, is seen as more of a left-leaning idealist than a savvy deal-maker like Lo\u0301pez Obrador. But she has promised to continue his agenda.\n\nIn a campaign rally outside Mexico's colonial-era Palacio Nacional on Wednesday, Sheinbaum, 61, lauded Lo\u0301pez Obrador as the \"best president Mexico has ever had,\" railed against \"neoliberalism\" and promised to carry on Lo\u0301pez Obrador's measures to combat inequality.\n\nThose measures include cash transfers to some 25 million Mexicans, O'Neil said, including elderly people, students and others.\n\n\"Humanism means reclaiming rights and eradicating classism, racism, machismo and discrimination \u2013 which all belong to right-wing thinking,\" Sheinbaum said.\n\nU.S.-Mexico cooperation suffered under Lo\u0301pez Obrador in some areas and held strong in others, and experts predict more of the same if Sheinbaum wins.\n\nLo\u0301pez Obrador scaled back security cooperation by quitting an agreement called the Me\u0301rida Initiative, under which the U.S. had committed $1.5 billion to help Mexico battle criminal organizations. But he renegotiated the key free trade agreement between the U.S., Canada and Mexico and has continued partnering with the U.S. on one of its current top priorities: slowing migration to the U.S. border.\n\nMexican voters concerned with economy, public safety\n\nBut the issues most important to the United States \u2013 trade, immigration, border security, drug trafficking \u2013 aren't the ones that Mexicans care about most.\n\nIn regions from the industrial north to the Caribbean coast and all-important capital city of 22 million people, Mexican voters are worried about inflation, economic opportunities and public safety in their own communities.\n\nIt's the biggest election the country has ever had, with 20,708 offices up for grabs, according to the National Electoral Institute. Campaigns across Mexico have been marred by violence; a mayoral candidate in southern Guerrero state was shot to death Wednesday.\n\n\"Whoever wins will be dealing with huge issues in terms of security,\" said Jennifer Apperti, director of the Texas-Mexico Center at Southern Methodist University.\n\nIn Mexico, the next administration's focus is likely to be domestic policy, not foreign policy, she said. \"Two of the biggest domestic issues are: What are we doing about crime and also jobs?\"\n\nOfficial corruption in Mexico and insatiable demand for drugs in the U.S. have helped criminal organizations flourish across many regions in Mexico. They've amassed power to control not only the drug trade but legitimate export industries including avocados and limes. Where rival organizations fight for territory, Mexicans live under a heavy cloud of extreme violence.\n\nGa\u0301lvez, the candidate trailing second in the polls, is trying to capitalize on that discontent. In her final campaign rally in the northern city of Monterrey, she called out the \"136,000 killed and 50,000 disappeared\" in Mexico during Lo\u0301pez Obrador's six-year term.\n\n\"This is the result of a security strategy in which the 'hugs' have been for criminals and the 'bullets' for citizens,\" she said, referring to Lo\u0301pez Obrador's signature \"hugs not bullets\" strategy of not tackling criminal organizations head-on.\n\nFaced with the realities of violence and weak economic growth in Mexico, in a recent poll by the El Paso, Texas-based Puente Collaborative, more than a third of Mexican respondents said they would consider migrating to the U.S. to improve their working or living conditions.\n\nA path for prosperity in U.S.-Mexico relationship\n\nBut more often Mexicans are staying put. They're finding jobs in the hundreds of assembly plants that send car parts, pacemakers, respirators, computers and Christmas lights to the U.S., or they're working in the booming tourist ports from Puerto Vallarta to Cancun.\n\nIn Mexico, the hundreds of thousands of migrants pushing north to the U.S. border are increasingly from somewhere else.\n\nIn Mexico City's enormous Zo\u0301calo public square on Wednesday, Lorenzo Pacheco held a sign for Sheinbaum. Pacheco has never worked in the U.S., he said. But with the peso gaining strength against the U.S. dollar, he recently took a four-day trip to visit the casinos of Las Vegas.\n\nHe wore the maroon color of Sheinbaum's political party, MORENA, and said he'd vote for her on Sunday. But even a militant \"morenista\" like him said the government hasn't done enough to fight organized crime.\n\n\"It's a problem the current government should handle with a tougher hand,\" he said. \"Because really they haven't solved the problem.\"\n\nLike many Mexicans, Pacheco sees a path for Mexican prosperity in its relationship with the U.S. The Puente poll found that 42% of Mexicans view the current relationship with the U.S. favorably and 60% hold a favorable opinion of U.S. citizens.\n\n\"The United States depends on Mexico as much as Mexico depends on the United States,\" Pacheco said. \"There should be more openness in trade and tourism and everything that benefits both countries. As one grows, so grows the other.\"\n\nOmar Ornelas reported from Mexico City.",

        "text": "Donald Trump warns supporters would reach \u2018breaking point\u2019 if he\u2019s jailed\nConvicted former US president says he cannot guarantee the American public \u2018would stand for\u2019 his jail time.\n\nFormer US President Donald Trump said while he would accept a prison sentence for his criminal conviction, it could prove a \u201cbreaking point\u201d for his supporters ahead of United States presidential elections in November.\n\nIn an interview aired on Sunday on Fox News, the current Republican White House hopeful acknowledged the possibility of jail time or house arrest following his historic criminal conviction in a hush-money trial.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m OK with it,\u201d Trump said, but added he was \u201cnot sure the public would stand for it\u201d.\n\n\u201cI think it would be tough for the public to take. You know at a certain point there\u2019s a breaking point,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump did not elaborate on what he thought might happen if that point is reached. He is scheduled to be sentenced on July 11, four days before Republicans gather to formally choose their presidential nominee to face Democratic President Joe Biden in this year\u2019s election.\n\n\u2018Chaos is not conservative\u2019\n\nThe warning will resonate in a country already concerned about the prospect of civil unrest and political harassment in the run-up to the November 5 ballot.\n\nTrump has used his conviction to step up his fundraising efforts but has not otherwise sought to mobilise his supporters, in contrast to his comments protesting his 2020 loss to Biden that were followed by an attack by his supporters on January 6, 2021, on the US Capitol.\n\nTrump\u2019s supporters stormed the Capitol after he delivered a fiery speech urging the crowd to \u201cfight like hell\u201d.\n\nUS House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Trump ally, said any response must be lawful.\n\n\u201cWe are the rule of law party \u2013 chaos is not a conservative value. We have to fight back and we will with everything in our arsenal. But we do that within the confines of the rule of law,\u201d Johnson told the programme Fox News Sunday.\n\nTrump will now be running as a convicted felon, and he has repeatedly refused to commit to accepting the result should he lose to Biden.\n\nExtremely unlikely\n\nA New York jury on Thursday convicted Trump on all 34 felony charges of falsifying business records in the final stages of the 2016 presidential campaign to cover up a sex scandal involving adult film star Stormy Daniels.\n\nAlthough each charge carries a possible four-year jail term, experts say it is extremely unlikely the judge will hand down a custodial sentence.\n\nTrump has vowed to appeal his conviction by the New York jury, while the matter is unlikely to be resolved before the presidential election. Opinion polls show a close race and suggest his conviction could hurt him with some Republican voters and independents.\n\nTrump faces three other criminal trials, including one related to efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election he lost to Biden.",

        "text": "Half of Americans think Trump's guilty verdict was correct, should end campaign: POLL\nA plurality of Americans, 50%, think former President Donald Trump's guilty verdict on all 34 counts in his hush money trial was correct, a new ABC News/Ipsos poll finds, and almost as many, 49%, think he should end his 2024 presidential campaign over the result.\n\nStill, following the historic criminal trial that ended this week in a first-ever conviction of a former president, Trump's favorability has remained stable at 31%, according to the latest ABC News/Ipsos poll conducted using Ipsos' KnowledgePanel. Trump was found guilty of 34 counts on Thursday in his trial related to falsifying business records regarding a payment made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election in order to keep her quiet about their alleged affair.\n\nThe former president has vowed to appeal, saying on Friday that \"bad people\" had levied the case \u2013 and charges\u2013 against him.\n\nFormer President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump walks to speak to the press after he was convicted in his criminal trial at Manhattan Criminal Court in New York City, on May 30, 2024. Justin Lane/POOL/AFP via Getty Images\n\nForty-seven percent of Americans said they think the charges against Trump in this case were politically motivated, while 38% say they were not. At the same time, the slight majority at 51%, think Trump intentionally did something illegal in this case. Twelve percent think Trump did something wrong but not intentionally, and 19% believe he did not do anything wrong.\n\nThe proportion of Americans who say Trump should end his presidential campaign as a result of this verdict is 49%, which is similar to findings from an April 2023 ABC News/Ipsos poll conducted shortly after the Manhattan grand jury handed down the indictment against him in this case. In the April 2023 polls, 48% thought he should suspend his campaign because of the indictment.\n\nBiden's favorability rating also remains low and unchanged, according to the new ABC News/Ipsos poll. His favorability rating currently stands at 32% compared to 33% in an ABC News/Ipsos poll conducted in March 2024. Public reaction to Trump's guilty verdict falls along partisan lines. For example, 83% of Democrats think the verdict was correct and 79% think he should end his campaign as a result, while only 16% of Republicans say the verdict was correct and the same percentage say he should end his presidential bid.\n\nBecause both Biden and Trump are broadly viewed unfavorably, the election could come down to independent voters, or even more specifically, those who dislike both candidates \u2013 sometimes referred to as double-haters.\n\nPresident Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump Getty Images\n\nA majority of Independents think Trump's verdict was correct, 52%, and the same amount believe that he should end his candidacy. For double-haters, those reactions are even more pronounced -- 65% of Americans who view both Trump and Biden unfavorably think the verdict this week was correct, with 67% believing Trump should end his presidential campaign.\n\nForty-five percent of Independents and 51% of double-haters think the hush-money trial was politically motivated, compared to 83% of Republicans and 20% of Democrats.\n\nIn the New York trial, Trump's attacks are largely directed at the district attorney, the judge and the jury -- all of which he's claimed are unfairly politically biased against him. Trump has also come after President Biden, claiming without evidence, that he was behind the prosecution.\n\n\"If they can do this to me, they can do this to anyone,\" Trump said during a press conference at Trump Tower in Manhattan. \"These are bad people. These are, in many cases, I believe, sick people.\" Biden, in his own remarks later on Friday, pushed back that the rule of law was \"reaffirmed\" and statements questioning the legitimacy of the process were \"dangerous.\"\n\nMETHODOLOGY\n\nThis ABC News/Ipsos poll was conducted using the probability-based Ipsos KnowledgePanel\u00ae May 31-June 1, 2024, in English and Spanish, among a random national sample of 781 U.S. adults. Results have a margin of sampling error of 3.7 points, including the design effect, for the full sample. Sampling error is not the only source of differences in polls. Partisan divisions are 31-29-32 percent, Democrats-Republicans-independents. See the poll's topline results and details on the methodology here.\n\nABC News' Dan Merkle and Ken Goldstein contributed to this report.",

        "summary": " Nayib Bukele has been wildly popular at home for his frontal attack on powerful gangs, which has converted El Salvador into one of Latin America\u2019s safest countries .

        "text": "US dampens criticism of El Salvador\u2019s president as migration overtakes democracy concerns\nSAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) \u2014 In 2021, the Biden administration turned down a meeting request with El Salvador\u2019s president, Nayib Bukele, on a trip to Washington, snubbing the self-proclaimed \u201cworld\u2019s coolest dictator\u201d for fear a photo op would embolden his attempts to expand his power base.\n\nA little more than three years later, it\u2019s the United States that\u2019s courting Bukele. A high-level delegation led by U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, and senior White House and State Department officials, attended Bukele\u2019s inauguration in San Salvador on Saturday to a second term.\n\nThe visit \u2014 unthinkable until recently \u2014 caps a quiet, 180-degree shift in Washington\u2019s policy toward the small Central American nation of 6 million that reflects how the Biden administration\u2019s criticisms of Bukele\u2019s strong-armed governing style have been overtaken by more urgent concerns tied to immigration \u2014 a key issue in this year\u2019s U.S. presidential election.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve realized what he\u2019s been doing works,\u201d Damian Merlo, an American adviser to Bukele who is registered to lobby on the Salvadoran government\u2019s behalf, said in an interview from El Salvador. \u201cIf the U.S. is serious about wanting to address the root causes of migration, then Bukele is someone who has actually done it.\u201d\n\nThe 42-year-old Bukele, who was reelected with 85% of the vote, has been wildly popular at home for his frontal attack on powerful gangs, which has converted what was once the world\u2019s murder capital into one of Latin America\u2019s safest countries. The improvement in public security is credited with a more than 60% drop in migration from the Central American country to the U.S. since Bukele took office in 2019 \u2014 a stark contrast with a growing exodus of migrants from other parts of Latin America.\n\n\u201cWe conquered fear, and today are truly a free nation,\u201d Bukele said in a speech Saturday to hundreds of supporters from the balcony of the National Palace after being sworn in for a second, five-year term.\n\nCured of what he called the \u201ccancer\u201d of gang violence, he said that his next term would be devoted to strengthening El Salvador\u2019s economy, vowing to apply the same independent, unconventional approach that has characterized his rule and won him admirers from conservatives throughout Latin America.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not here to do what others think I should do. I\u2019m here to do what\u2019s best for our country,\u201d he said.\n\nUntil recently, Bukele\u2019s crackdown on the gangs \u2014 as well as political opponents \u2014 had drawn fire from Washington. A state of emergency originally declared in 2022 and still in effect has been used to round up 78,175 suspected gang members in sweeps that rights groups say are often arbitrary, based on a person\u2019s appearance or where they live. The government has had to release about 7,000 people because of a lack of evidence.\n\nAfter Biden took office, the U.S. sanctioned several of Bukele\u2019s top aides on allegations of corruption and shifted foreign assistance from government agencies to civil society groups highly critical of Bukele.\n\nIn 2021, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris said that Washington had \u201c deep concerns about El Salvador\u2019s democracy \" after lawmakers loyal to Bukele removed several Supreme Court justices that were among the last check on the president\u2019s power. A few months later, the new justices lifted a constitutional ban on consecutive reelection, something the U.S. State Department denounced as the outcome of \u201ca clear strategy to undermine judicial independence.\u201d\n\nThe about-face, observers say, started a little more than a year ago when Biden sent William Duncan, a career diplomat, to San Salvador as U.S. ambassador. Then, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Salvadoran Foreign Minister Alexandra Hill in Washington. Bukele, a gifted communicator who in the past praised former U.S. President Donald Trump and cozied up to China, has also avoided direct confrontation, although he still managed to ruffle feathers when he attended a conservative political gathering outside Washington earlier this year.\n\n\u201cMigration trumps everything else,\u201d said Michael Shifter, a former president of Inter-American Dialogue in Washington. \u201cThe ideal Latin American partner would be effective in its security policy while respecting human rights norms and practices and cooperating with the U.S. on migration. But rarely do all these desirable things go together, which poses tough choices for U.S. policymakers.\u201d\n\nShifter said that such a high-level delegation like the one in El Salvador is rarely sent to presidential inaugurations, even of the United States\u2019 closest allies in the region. Besides Mayorkas, it includes Brian Nichols, the assistant secretary of state for the Western Hemisphere, and Daniel Erikson, Biden\u2019s top national security adviser on Latin America. Six members of congress, including three Democrats, and Donald Trump Jr. are also attending.\n\n\u201cPretty solid way to travel,\u201d Trump Jr. said in a video posted on TikTok as he was escorted by El Salvador\u2019s police to the inauguration ceremony. \u201cJust promoting those who support freedom around the world.\u201d\n\nMayorkas met with Bukele on the eve of his inauguration to discuss migration, public security and ways to strengthen the fight against narcotics trafficking.\n\n\u201cI want to express the United States\u2019 dedication to supporting the growth and prosperity of El Salvador through continued bilateral cooperation,\u201d Mayorkas said in a message on social media.\n\nThe U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nBut Ricardo Z\u00faniga, a retired U.S. diplomat who handled migration talks with Central America in the early days of the Biden administration, said that Washington may come to regret its recent embrace of Bukele.\n\n\u201cBukele will be in power for many years to come, so you need to have a working relationship,\u201d said Z\u00faniga, who was the principal deputy assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs until his retirement last fall. \u201cBut you also have to be clear eyed. This is an authoritarian government ruled by a single party that is not sympathetic to U.S. strategic interests.\u201d\n\n___\n\nJoshua Goodman reported from Miami.",

        "summary": " The Dalai Lama is 88 years old and in declining health, and seldom leaves his home in exile in Dharamsala, in India . The bodhisattva has decided, after much procrastination, to come to New York this summer to investigate the possibility of replacing him .",
        "text": "The Dalai Lama Is Landing in the Middle of the 2024 Election\nIn early September of 2020, Joe Biden, then the Democratic nominee for president, promised to put values\u2014values held in contempt, he argued, by the man he would go on to defeat\u2014at the center of American foreign policy. To act on his promise, he said, he would do something Donald Trump had neglected to do. \u201cI\u2019ll meet with His Holiness the Dalai Lama,\u201d Biden said.\n\nFor American presidents, meeting the 14th Dalai Lama can bring tension and discord, because Communist Party leaders in Beijing consider Tibet to be a part of China. They consider any recognition of the Dalai Lama\u2014a Mandela-level icon, a symbol of Tibet\u2019s will to survive, and also (by the way) a living Buddha, a bodhisattva, to his millions of followers\u2014a terrible insult to Chinese sensitivities. (To be fair, Chinese leaders are omnidirectionally offended, by supporters of Taiwanese independence and Hong Kong democracy; by Christians and Uyghurs and Mongols; and by anyone else who threatens their Middle Kingdom sense of imperial entitlement.)\n\nMore than three years into his term, Biden has not made good on his promise, though he has a plausible excuse: The Dalai Lama is 88 years old and in declining health, and he seldom leaves his home in exile in Dharamsala, in the Himalayan foothills of India. But the Dalai Lama\u2019s age now provides a path for Biden to keep his promise: The bodhisattva has bad knees and has decided, after much procrastination, to come to New York this summer to investigate the possibility of replacement.\n\nA visit by Biden to the Dalai Lama\u2019s hospital\u2014or an after-surgery invitation to the White House\u2014would signal continuing American concern over the oppression of Tibet and Tibetans, as well as support for one of the most heroic and pacific humanitarian leaders of our age. Such a visit would also have the benefit of signaling to the Chinese government that a U.S. president makes decisions independent of Chinese Communist feelings. (American CEOs are particularly feeble at signaling such independence.) A call on the Dalai Lama couldn\u2019t possibly hurt Biden\u2019s standing among voters, especially considering the Dalai Lama\u2019s previous lack of interest in meeting with Trump when he was president. Five years ago, when I visited the Dalai Lama at his monastery in Manali, he told me that he did not look favorably on Trump\u2019s jingoistic \u201cAmerica First\u201d rhetoric. \u201cEveryone first,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cA much better idea.\u201d\n\nThe exact timing of his trip to the United States\u2014his first in seven years\u2014has not yet been decided, but it will follow another event of some significance: a visit later this month to Dharamsala by Representative Nancy Pelosi, the former speaker of the House, and a congressional delegation. Pelosi has championed the Tibetan cause for decades, and, to her credit, she is loathed by Beijing for her comprehensive criticism of China\u2019s human-rights record. In one of Pelosi\u2019s earliest meetings with the Dalai Lama, she was so ferocious in her criticism of China\u2019s human-rights abuses that the Dalai Lama said, impishly, \u201cNow let us all pray so that we could rid Nancy of her negative attitudes.\u201d (Pelosi\u2019s trip has not yet been announced, and her spokesperson declined to comment, citing security concerns; news of the Dalai Lama\u2019s proposed visit this summer was confirmed to me by sources involved in planning the trip.)\n\nThe reemergence of the Dalai Lama into American politics in the months preceding the 2024 presidential election is good news for the unfortunate Tibetan cause, constantly steamrollered as it is by the raw deployment of Chinese power. In Dharamsala, the seat of the Tibetan government in exile, fear is ever present that the Dalai Lama\u2019s eventual demise will make even more marginal the cause of Tibetan cultural and political independence. (As is implied by his status as the 14th Dalai Lama, the discovery of a 15th Dalai Lama is likely, though he will be reincarnated, according to Tibetan Buddhist tradition, as a small child, not as someone ready for international diplomacy. And the Chinese government has its own plan to identify and elevate a quisling lama.)\n\nTwo months ago, I visited Dharamsala with, among others, Arthur Brooks, the Atlantic columnist and frequent writing collaborator of the Dalai Lama\u2019s. We both experienced a religious leader who, though hobbled by knee pain and slowed by age, was still lucid and eloquent on the great subjects of freedom and happiness. I called Arthur today to ask him what he makes of this news.\n\n\u201cIn a contentious election year, it\u2019s good to remind Americans of our core values as a people, and among those values are religious freedom and standing up for the dignity of all people around the world,\u201d he said. \u201cHis Holiness the Dalai Lama, as we saw in Dharamsala in April, still has the ability to remind people around the world of what is good and true. For a Tibetan monk, he has an uncanny gift for bringing out the best of what it means to be a person and an American. This is an opportunity that President Biden cannot and should not miss.\u201d",

        "text": "Abortion, guns, Trump and more: These are the Supreme Court\u2019s biggest remaining cases\nEditor\u2019s Note: A previous version of this story first ran on June 2, 2024.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nThe Supreme Court is turning toward the final, frenzied days of its term, readying potential blockbuster decisions on abortion, guns and former President Donald Trump\u2019s claims of absolute immunity.\n\nThe court will hand down opinions on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday this week as the justices aim to finish their work by the last day in June.\n\nThe decisions will land rapidly at a tense time for the 6-3 conservative-liberal court \u2013 just before a historic presidential election that has been heavily influenced by its decision two years ago to overturn Roe v. Wade. Public opinion of the court remains at record lows. Conservative Justice Samuel Alito, meanwhile, has faced sharp blowback over two controversial flags raised at his homes in Virginia and New Jersey.\n\nHere are some of the remaining cases to be decided this week.\n\nTrump claims \u2018absolute\u2019 immunity\n\nTrump\u2019s appeal for immunity from special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s election subversion charges landed at the Supreme Court late in the term and instantly overshadowed most of the docket.\n\nTrump argued that without immunity, presidents would be hamstrung in office, always fearful of being second guessed by a zealous prosecutor after leaving the White House. That position appeared to have some purchase on the conservative Supreme Court during oral arguments in April, though it didn\u2019t appear Trump would be able to get Smith\u2019s case tossed entirely.\n\nThe immunity case, appears likely to come down to whether Trump\u2019s post-election actions were \u201cofficial\u201d \u2013 that is, steps he was taking as president \u2013 or whether they were \u201cprivate,\u201d which would not likely receive immunity.\n\nAn appeals court in Washington sided against Trump.\n\nAbortion for health in emergencies\n\nThe Supreme Court will decide what happens when pregnant women show up to the hospital with medical emergencies in states that have strict bans on abortion. An Idaho law bars doctors from performing abortions unless the mother\u2019s life is at risk, but it makes no exception if that she would suffer long-term health consequences.\n\nThe Biden administration argues a federal law requires hospitals to perform abortions if the health of a mother is at stake, and an appeals court agreed.\n\nThe decision in Moyle v. US will place abortion access on the forefront again this summer just as Americans begin tuning into the presidential election.\n\nJanuary 6 rioters seek to shorten sentences\n\nA former Pennsylvania police officer who rioted at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, challenged federal obstruction charges filed against him in a case that could also affect Trump. The former president was charged with violating the same obstruction law for different reasons.\n\nThe case was filed by Joseph Fischer, who was charged with multiple crimes for pushing his way into the Capitol after attending Trump\u2019s rally outside the White House on January 6. Fischer\u2019s attorney told the justices that prosecutors went too far by charging his client with \u201cobstructing\u201d an official proceeding, a crime he said Congress intended to be used to prohibit the destruction of evidence.\n\nSome 350 rioters were charged with the crime, which can add up to 20 years to a prison sentence. Some of those charges have since been dropped as part of plea agreements.\n\nProsecutors say the charge should apply to the January 6 cases because the plain meaning of the words \u201cobstruct\u201d and \u201cofficial proceeding\u201d covers the attack that interrupted Congress\u2019 counting of ballots to certify Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 win. Critics say the law was intended to prevent evidence tampering before a trial or investigation.\n\nGovernment regulation of Facebook\n\nThe Supreme Court is confronting a series of cases at the intersection of the First Amendment and social media. Perhaps the most notable are two suits challenging laws enacted in Florida and Texas aimed at stopping social media giants like Facebook and X from throttling conservative views.\n\nThe state laws ban online platforms from removing posts that express opinions, such as political content. The Republican governors who signed the laws said they were needed to keep the social media platforms from discriminating against conservatives.\n\nTwo trade associations representing the social media companies sued, claiming they violated the First Amendment. One federal appeals court in Atlanta sided with the companies and against Florida. Another, in New Orleans, allowed the Texas law to take effect. The Supreme Court paused implementation of the Texas law in 2022.\n\nThe cases are Moody v. NetChoice and NetChoice v. Paxton.\n\nCleaning up online \u2018disinformation\u2019\n\nThe justices must decide if the White House and federal agencies such as the FBI may urge social media platforms to take down content the government views as misinformation, or whether those efforts violate the First Amendment.\n\nBiden officials have for years tried to persuade social media platforms to take down posts featuring misinformation about vaccines, the Covid-19 pandemic and the 2020 election, among other things.\n\nRepublican officials in two states \u2013 Missouri and Louisiana \u2013 and five social media users sued over that practice in 2022, arguing the administration did far more than \u201cpersuade\u201d the tech giants to take down a few deceptive items. The case is Murthy v. Missouri.\n\nGovernment regulations threatened\n\nA series of cases this term challenge the power of federal agencies to approve regulations \u2013 or enforce them. Among the most significant are two appeals filed by Atlantic herring fishermen. The captains are challenging a Department of Commerce regulation that requires them to pay the salary of federal observers they bring on board to monitor the catch and ensure the crew follows other fishing regulations.\n\nThe court is being asked to overturn a 1984 precedent \u2013 Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council \u2013 that required courts to give deference to federal agencies when creating regulations based on an ambiguous law. Conservatives have long sought to rein in regulatory authority, arguing Washington has too much control over industry.\n\nThe justices have been incrementally diminishing federal power for years, but the new case gives the court an opportunity to take a much broader stroke.\n\nCritics fear a ruling for the fishermen would threaten a vast swath of other federal regulations aimed at protecting the environment, public health and workplace safety. The cases are Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo and Relentless v. Department of Commerce. Lower courts sided with the government in both cases.\n\nDomestic violence gun law upheld\n\nIn a significant Second Amendment case, the justices upheld the constitutionality of a federal law that bars people who are the subject of domestic violence restraining orders from possessing guns. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the opinion for the 8-1 majority.\n\nA Texas man, Zackey Rahimi, was indicted for violating that law following a series of shootings, including one in which police said he fired into the air at a Whataburger restaurant after a friend\u2019s credit card was declined.\n\nRahimi\u2019s lawyers claimed a Supreme Court decision two years ago in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen meant the domestic violence law cannot be squared with the Constitution because it has no historical analogue. A 6-3 majority in Bruen said gun regulations must be \u201cconsistent with this nation\u2019s historical tradition of firearm regulation.\u201d\n\nBut the Supreme Court ruled that there were similar historic laws on the books at the time of the nation\u2019s founding that allowed the government to disarm dangerous people. Justice Clarence Thomas penned a solo dissent.\n\nAccess to abortion pill maintained\n\nIn another major abortion case, the Supreme Court upheld US Food and Drug Administration efforts to expand access to the abortion pill mifepristone.\n\nThe unanimous ruling was a significant setback for the anti-abortion movement in what was the first major Supreme Court case on reproductive rights since the conservative majority overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. By ruling that the anti-abortion doctors don\u2019t have standing to sue, the court left expanded access to the drug in place.\n\nAccess to mifepristone has become particularly important after the court overturned Roe and many states banned the procedure in clinical settings. Medication abortions account for nearly two-thirds of all abortions in the US, according to some estimates.\n\nThe appeal was filed by anti-abortion doctors who said their practices have been affected because they must treat women who had complications from the drug. The FDA and outside medical groups have stressed that mifepristone is safe.\n\nThe lead medical group in the suit, the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, was incorporated in Amarillo, Texas, months before it sued. The location allowed the group to choose a court where it was guaranteed to be assigned to conservative US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk. Now, the case is expected to return to Kacsmaryk\u2019s court.\n\nThough the decision was a win for abortion rights groups, it was not a total victory: Other groups are likely to sue over the same provisions. Three conservative states that intervened in the original lawsuit may attempt to revive it.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.",

        "text": "Iceland elects businesswoman Halla Tomasdottir as President\nHalla Tomasdottir, a businesswoman and investor, has won Iceland\u2019s presidential election, topping a crowded field of candidates in which the top three finishers were women, the country's national broadcast service reported.\n\nMs. Tomasdottir was elected to the largely ceremonial post with 34.3% of the vote, defeating former Prime Minister Katrin Jakobsdottir, with 25.2%, and Halla Hrund Logadottir, with 15.5%, RUV said on June 2.\n\nMs. Tomasdottir, 55, campaigned as someone who was above party politics and could help open discussions on fundamental issues such as the effect of social media on the mental health of young people, Iceland\u2019s development as a tourist destination and the role of artificial intelligence.\n\nShe will replace President Gudni Th. Johannesson, who did not seek re-election after two four-year terms. Ms. Tomasdottir will take office on August 1.\n\nIceland, a Nordic island nation located in the North Atlantic, has about 384,000 people and a long tradition of electing women to high office. Vigdis Finbogadottir was the first democratically elected female President of any nation when she became Iceland\u2019s Head of State in 1980.\n\nThe country has also seen two women serve as Prime Minister in recent years, providing stability during years of political turmoil. Johanna Sigurdardottir led the government from 2009-2013, after the global financial crisis ravaged Iceland\u2019s economy. Ms. Jakobsdottir became Prime Minister in 2017, leading a broad coalition that ended the cycle of crises that had triggered three elections in four years. She resigned in April to run for President.\n\nMs. Tomasdottir first rose to prominence during the financial crisis, when she was hailed as the co-founder of Audur Capital, one of the few Icelandic investment firms that survived the upheaval. She is currently on leave as chief executive of the B Team, a non-profit organization that works to promote workplace diversity and has offices in New York and London.",

        "summary": " US courts El Salvador's president as migration overtakes democracy concerns . Nayib Bukele has been wildly popular at home for his frontal attack on powerful gangs . The improvement in public security is credited with a more than 60% drop in migration from the Central American country to the U.S.",
        "text": "US courts El Salvador's president as migration overtakes democracy concerns\nIn 2021, the Biden administration turned down a meeting request with El Salvador's president, Nayib Bukele, on a trip to Washington, snubbing the self-proclaimed \"world's coolest dictator\" for fear a photo op would embolden his attempts to expand his power base.\n\nA little more than three years later, it's the United States that's courting Bukele. A high-level delegation led by U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, and senior White House and State Department officials, attended Bukele's inauguration in San Salvador on Saturday to a second term.\n\nThe visit caps a quiet, 180-degree shift in Washington's policy toward the small Central American nation of 6 million that reflects how the Biden administration's criticisms of Bukele's strong-armed governing style have been overtaken by more urgent concerns tied to immigration \u2014 a key issue in this year's U.S. presidential election.\n\n\"They've realized what he's been doing works,\" Damian Merlo, an American adviser to Bukele who is registered to lobby on the Salvadoran government's behalf, said in an interview from El Salvador. \"If the U.S. is serious about wanting to address the root causes of migration, then Bukele is someone who has actually done it.\"\n\nThe 42-year-old Bukele, who was reelected with 85% of the vote, has been wildly popular at home for his frontal attack on powerful gangs, which has converted what was once the world's murder capital into one of Latin America's safest countries. The improvement in public security is credited with a more than 60% drop in migration from the Central American country to the U.S. since Bukele took office in 2019 \u2014 a stark contrast with a growing exodus of migrants from other parts of Latin America.\n\n\"We conquered fear, and today are truly a free nation,\" Bukele said in a speech Saturday to hundreds of supporters from the balcony of the National Palace after being sworn in for a second, five-year term.\n\nCured of what he called the cancer of gang violence, he said that his next term would be devoted to strengthening El Salvador's economy, vowing to apply the same independent, unconventional approach that has characterized his rule and won him admirers from conservatives throughout Latin America.\n\n\"I'm not here to do what others think I should do. I'm here to do what's best for our country,\" he said.\n\nUntil recently, Bukele's crackdown on the gangs \u2014 as well as political opponents \u2014 had drawn fire from Washington. A state of emergency originally declared in 2022 and still in effect has been used to round up 78,175 suspected gang members in sweeps that rights groups say are often arbitrary, based on a person's appearance or where they live. The government has had to release about 7,000 people because of a lack of evidence.\n\nAfter Biden took office, the U.S. sanctioned several of Bukele's top aides on allegations of corruption and shifted foreign assistance from government agencies to civil society groups highly critical of Bukele.\n\nThe about-face, observers say, started a little more than a year ago when Biden sent William Duncan, a career diplomat, to San Salvador as U.S. ambassador. Then, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Salvadoran Foreign Minister Alexandra Hill in Washington. Bukele, who in the past praised former U.S. President Donald Trump and cozied up to China, has also avoided direct confrontation.\n\n\"Migration trumps everything else,\" said Michael Shifter, a former president of Inter-American Dialogue in Washington. \"The ideal Latin American partner would be effective in its security policy while respecting human rights norms and practices and cooperating with the U.S. on migration. But rarely do all these desirable things go together, which poses tough choices for U.S. policymakers.\"\n\nThe U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nBut Ricardo Z\u00faniga, a retired U.S. diplomat who handled migration talks with Central America in the early days of the Biden administration, said that Washington may come to regret its recent embrace of Bukele.\n\n\"Bukele will be in power for many years to come, so you need to have a working relationship,\" he said. \"But you also have to be clear eyed. This is an authoritarian government ruled by a single party that is not sympathetic to U.S. strategic interests.\"",

        "text": "Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine signs bill to ensure Biden will appear on state's general election ballot\nCLEVELAND \u2014 Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine announced Sunday he had signed a bill to secure President Joe Biden\u2019s spot on the state\u2019s November ballot, ending weeks of political gamesmanship over a deadline that in past years was relaxed without drama.\n\nThe bill passed Friday in a special session of the state Senate before heading to the governor's desk.\n\nDeWine, a Republican, called the special session to resolve the Biden issue and tackle unrelated campaign finance legislation.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody on this side of the aisle really feels like they\u2019re going to be voting for President Biden, but at the same time, Ohioans deserve a choice in this election, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeking to give them today,\u201d state Sen. Rob McColley, a Republican, said Friday in supporting the measure.\n\nThe bill\u2019s approval is not expected to halt a push to nominate Biden by a virtual roll call vote well ahead of a late August convention.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee announced that plan earlier this week, preferring to sidestep what had become an unpredictable partisan fight and ensure Biden is certified as the nominee before Ohio\u2019s Aug. 7 deadline. The DNC indicated Friday that a Tuesday meeting for its rules and bylaws committee to advance on a resolution that would enable the virtual roll call will go on as scheduled. A full DNC vote would follow.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s action echoes what we already knew: Since the beginning of this process, Ohio Republicans have been playing partisan games and trying to chip away at our democracy, while Democrats have been defending Ohioans\u2019 right to vote,\u201d DNC senior spokesperson Hannah Muldavin said. \u201cJoe Biden will be on the ballot in all 50 states, and we are already taking action to make sure that\u2019s the case, regardless of Ohio Republicans\u2019 shenanigans.\u201d\n\nIn the past, both parties have had to reconcile late summer nominating conventions with earlier state deadlines to certify candidates for the general election ballot. Ohio, for example, eased the deadline four years ago for both Democrats and Republicans without much fanfare or controversy. This year, the issue only applies to Democrats in Ohio, as the GOP has planned a mid-July convention.\n\nOhio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Republican, warned Democrats last month that Biden was in danger of not qualifying for the ballot. In recent weeks, many GOP lawmakers conditioned their support for moving the deadline on a vote to ban non-U.S. citizens from donating to campaigns for state ballot initiatives. DeWine requested that the state legislature consider both of those issues in his call for this week\u2019s special session.\n\nDemocrats have described the restrictions on foreign money and other elements of the legislation as an unnecessary \u201cpoison pill\u201d that would weaken citizen-led petition drives. Voters in Ohio last year codified abortion rights in the state\u2019s constitution, and progressives are backing a redistricting reform measure targeted for the November ballot.\n\nRepublicans hold supermajorities in both the state House and Senate, but the GOP leaders of both chambers were rarely on the same page when negotiating the legislation, a reflection of fractious internal politics that have rocked the Ohio Statehouse in recent years. The uncertainty frustrated Democrats and prompted Biden and the DNC to set the virtual roll call in motion.\n\nIn the end, the state House and Senate approved both the campaign finance-related legislation and Biden fix in separate bills. DeWine also announced he had signed the former bill Sunday.\n\n\u201cThis bill \u2014 only a temporary fix \u2014 was conditional through the attack on voter ballot initiatives,\u201d state Rep. Dontavius Jarrells, a Democrat, said in a Thursday floor speech in support of the Biden-related bill. \u201cThe political maneuvering and legislative tricks that have brought us here to today\u2019s special session are a stark reminder of why we must end gerrymandering in Ohio.\u201d\n\nJarrells and other Democrats voiced frustration that the bill only relaxed this year\u2019s certification deadline, meaning that presidential nominees of either party could face a similar situation in future elections. Democratic amendments to make the fix permanent were tabled Thursday and Friday. Republican lawmakers said they are open to the idea but want more time to seek input from state and local elections officials\n\n\u201cI think we ought to take some input from the secretary of state,\u201d state Rep. Bob Peterson, the Republican who chairs the House Government Oversight Committee, said Wednesday. \u201cI think we need to talk to local boards of elections. There's reasons why those time frames are put in place so that they can do the work.\u201d",

        "text": "U.S. Embassy & Consulate in New Zealand, Cook Islands and Niue\nVote in the 2024 U.S. Federal Elections\n\nYour vote counts!\n\nDid you know that many U.S. federal elections for the House of Representatives and Senate have been decided by a margin smaller than the number of ballots cast by absentee voters? All states are required to count every absentee ballot that is valid and reaches local election officials by the absentee ballot receipt deadline.\n\nFollow a few simple steps to make sure that you can vote in the 2024 federal U.S. elections:\n\nStep 1: Request your ballot:\n\nComplete a new Federal Post Card Application -FPCA. You must complete a new FPCA after January 1, 2024 to ensure you receive your ballot for the 2024 elections. Submitting the FPCA allows you to request absentee ballots for all elections for federal offices (President, U.S. Senate, and U.S. House of Representatives) including primaries and special elections during the calendar year in which it is submitted. All local election officials in all U.S. states and territories accept the FPCA.\n\nYou can complete the FPCA online at FVAP.gov. The online voting assistant will ask you questions specific to your state. We encourage you to request your blank ballots be delivered electronically \u2013 by email, internet download, or fax, depending on your state. Include your email address on your FPCA to take advantage of the electronic ballot delivery option. Return the FPCA per the instructions on the website. The online voting assistant will tell you if your state allows the FPCA to be returned electronically or if you must submit a paper copy with original ink signature. If you must return a paper version, please follow the same instructions below for returning your ballot.\n\nStep 2: Receive and complete your ballot:\n\nStates are required to send out ballots 45 days before a regular election for federal office and generally send ballots at least 30 days before primary elections. For most states, you can confirm your registration and ballot delivery online.\n\nStep 3: Return your completed ballot:\n\nWhile some states allow you to return your completed ballot electronically, others do not. If your state requires you to return paper voting forms or ballots to local election officials, you can do so free of charge at the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate. Place your ballot in a postage-paid return envelope or in an envelope bearing sufficient domestic U.S. postage, and address them to the relevant local election officials.\n\nMail your completed ballots to 23 Customs St., Level 3, Auckland CBD, 1010. Ballots should be packaged in an outer envelope addressed to the Consulate with an interior envelope addressed to your voter home election official. You may alternatively drop off your self-addressed envelope, at the Consulate from 0800 to 1700 at the Consulate \u2013 we are closed on U.S. and New Zealand Holidays. The interior envelope must have sufficient U.S. postage or us FVAP\u2019s prepaid envelope. You can also return your FPCA or ballot to your local election officials via international mail or professional courier service at your own expense.\n\nResearch candidates and issues:\n\nPlease see the FVAP links page for resources you can use to research candidates and issues. FVAP regularly sends information about election dates and deadlines through their Voting Alerts. Email vote@fvap.gov to subscribe or follow FVAP on Facebook or Twitter.\n\nLearn more at the Federal Voting Assistance Program\u2019s \u2013 FVAP- website, FVAP.gov.\n\nIf you have any questions about registering to vote overseas, please contact Auckland\u2019s Voting Assistance Officer at voteAuckland@state.gov Auckland, and voteWellington@state.gov Wellington.\n\nRemember, your vote counts!\n\nFor more Information visit:\n\n..our Absentee Voting Page here.",

        "text": "Mexico elects Claudia Sheinbaum as its first female president\nRead the latest: Claudia Sheinbaum sworn in as 1st female president of Mexico\n\n\n\nMEXICO CITY (AP) \u2014 Mexico\u2019s projected presidential winner Claudia Sheinbaum will become the first female president in the country\u2019s 200-year history.\n\nSheinbaum, the favored successor of outgoing President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, vowed to continue on the direction set by the populist leftist leader. But the cool-tempered scientist offers a sharp contrast in style \u2014 and a break with Mexico\u2019s male-dominated political culture.\n\n\u201cI promise that I am not going to let you down,\u201d Sheinbaum said, greeting supports in Mexico City\u2019s colonial-era main plaza, the Zocalo.\n\nThe National Electoral Institute\u2019s president said Sheinbaum had between 58.3% and 60.7% of the vote, while opposition candidate X\u00f3chitl G\u00e1lvez had between 26.6% and 28.6% and Jorge \u00c1lvarez M\u00e1ynez had between 9.9% and 10.8% of the vote. Sheinbaum\u2019s Morena party was also projected to hold its majorities in both chambers of Congress.\n\nAS IT HAPPENED Catch the highlights from the AP\u2019s coverage as Claudia Sheinbaum made history.\n\nThe climate scientist and former Mexico City mayor said that her two competitors had called her and conceded her victory.\n\nThe official preliminary count put Sheinbaum 28 points ahead of G\u00e1lvez with nearly 50% of polling places reporting.\n\nThe fact that the two leading candidates were women had left little doubt that Mexico would make history Sunday.\n\n\u201cAs I have said on other occasions, I do not arrive alone,\u201d Sheinbaum said shortly after her victory was confirmed. \u201cWe all arrived, with our heroines who gave us our homeland, with our mothers, our daughters and our granddaughters.\u201d\n\nSheinbaum will also be the first person from a Jewish background to lead the overwhelmingly Catholic country.\n\nShe will start her six-year term Oct. 1. Mexico\u2019s constitution does not allow reelection.\n\nVoters choosing Mexico\u2019s next president will decide Sunday between a former academic who promises to further the current leader\u2019s populist policies and an ex-senator and tech entrepreneur who pledges to up the fight against deadly drug cartels.\n\nThe leftist has said she believes the government has a strong role to play in addressing economic inequality and providing a sturdy social safety net, much like her political mentor.\n\nL\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s anointed successor, the 61-year-old Sheinbaum consistntly led in polls despite a spirited challenge from G\u00e1lvez. This was the first time in Mexico that the two main opponents were women.\n\n\u201cOf course, I congratulate Claudia Sheinbaum with all my respect who ended up the winner by a wide margin,\u201d L\u00f3pez Obrador said shortly after the electoral authorities\u2019 announcement. \u201cShe is going to be Mexico\u2019s first (female) president in 200 years.\u201d\n\nIf the margin holds it would approach his landslide victory in 2018. L\u00f3pez Obrador won the presidency after two unsuccessful tries with 53.2% of the votes, in a three-way race where National Action took 22.3% and the Institutional Revolutionary Party took 16.5%.\n\nStill, Sheinbaum is unlikely to enjoy the kind of unquestioning devotion that L\u00f3pez Obrador has enjoyed.\n\nIn the Zocalo, Sheinbaum\u2019s win did not draw the kind of cheering, jubilant crowds that greeted L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s victory in 2018. Those present were enthusiastic, but comparatively few in number.\n\nSara R\u00edos, 76, a retired literature professor at Mexico\u2019s National Autonomous University, celebrated after hearing that G\u00e1lvez had conceded.\n\nOutgoing President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador and first lady Beatriz Guti\u00e9rrez M\u00fcller arrive to vote during general elections in Mexico City, Sunday, June 2, 2024.

But his highest hope is that Sheinbaum can \u201cimprove what AMLO couldn\u2019t do, the price of gasoline, crime and drug trafficking, which he didn\u2019t combat even though he had the power.\u201d\n\nThe main opposition candidate, G\u00e1lvez, a tech entrepreneur and former senator, had promised a more aggressive approach toward organized crime.\n\nIn her concession speech, she said \u201cI want to stress that my recognition (of Sheinbaum\u2019s victory) comes with a firm demand for results and solutions to the country\u2019s serious problems.\u201d\n\nL\u00f3pez Obrador claims to have reduced historically high homicide levels by 20% since he took office in December 2018. But that\u2019s largely a claim based on a questionable reading of statistics. The real homicide rate appears to have declined by only about 4% in six years.\n\nJulio Garc\u00eda, a Mexico City office worker, said he voted for the opposition because of crime. \u201cThey\u2019ve robbed me twice at gunpoint. You have to change direction, change leadership,\u201d the 34-year-old said. \u201cContinuing the same way, we\u2019re going to become Venezuela.\u201d\n\nOn the fringes of Mexico City in the neighborhood of San Andres Totoltepec, 34-year-old homemaker Stephania Navarrete said she planned to vote for Sheinbaum despite her own doubts about L\u00f3pez Obrador and his party.\n\n\u201cHaving a woman president, for me as a Mexican woman, it\u2019s going to be like before when for the simple fact that you say you are a woman you\u2019re limited to certain professions. Not anymore.\u201d\n\nShe said the social programs of Sheinbaum\u2019s mentor were crucial, but added that deterioration of cartel violence in the past few years was her primary concern in this election.\n\nOpposition presidential candidate X\u00f3chitl G\u00e1lvez waves as she leaves a polling station after voting in the general election, in Mexico City, Sunday, June 2, 2024.

His Morena party currently holds 23 of the 32 governorships and a simple majority of seats in both houses of Congress.\n\nSheinbaum promised to continue all of L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s policies, including a universal pension for the elderly and a program that pays youths to apprentice.\n\nVoters stand in line as they wait their turn to cast their ballots, during general elections in Mexico City, Sunday, June 2, 2024.

        "text": "The upside-down American flag goes mainstream as a form of right-wing protest\nThe upside-down American flag goes mainstream as a form of right-wing protest\n\ntoggle caption Jose Luis Magana/AP\n\nAfter former President Donald Trump\u2019s historic felony conviction, many of his supporters protested the verdict by posting images of an American flag flipped upside down on social media.\n\nA Manhattan jury on Thursday found Trump guilty of falsifying business records in order to influence the 2016 presidential election. Soon after the verdict was read, right-wing politicians and pundits including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., Fox News contributor Guy Benson and far-right conspiracy theorist Ali Alexander shared images of an inverted American flag on social media. Alexander, organizer of the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally that pushed false claims about the 2020 election, posted the upside-down flag on Telegram with the message: \u201cNo one is coming to save us. We must.\u201d\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe phrases \u201cRIP America\u201d and \u201cCivil War,\" which began trending on the social media platform X, were also seen alongside flipped flags and messages of outrage at the verdict.\n\nA report from The New York Times last month revealed that an upside-down American flag flew outside the Virginia home of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito in January 2021. At that time, the flag had emerged as an anti-Biden protest symbol synonymous with the false claim that the election had been stolen from Trump. Earlier that month, rioters at the siege on the U.S. Capitol carried the same flags. Justice Alito has said his wife is responsible for controversial flags flying outside their homes.\n\n\u201cWhen you have a Supreme Court justice or his family use it as a symbol of America being in distress, you know it's gone mainstream,\u201d said Ken Paulson, director of the Free Speech Center at Middle Tennessee State University.\n\nThe upside-down American flag, originally an apolitical symbol used by sailors to signal that their ship was in trouble, has since been adopted by both the political left and right in protest. Across the political spectrum, it's been used to express dissent on a range of issues, including gun violence, the Flint water crisis and the overturning of the Roe v. Wade ruling that protected the right to an abortion.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIn recent years, however, the usage of the flipped U.S. flag has seen a partisan shift more frequently taken up by the extreme right.\n\n\u201cYou are seeing this spike [of the flipped U.S. flag] being used less by the left and more by the right who has had this Trumpian history of \u2018Make America Great Again because [they believe] it hasn't been great in some time,\u2019 \u201d said Bethan Johnson, a postdoctoral scholar who researches political extremism with the Initiative to Study Hate at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\n\n\nFrom distress to outrage\n\nBefore it was used in protests, sailors stuck at sea are known to have flown the U.S. flag upside down as \u201cthe easiest way to signal distress without having any special flag,\u201d Ted Kaye, secretary of the North American Vexillological Association, told the Times.\n\nThe practice dates back to at least the 17th century, during the Anglo-Dutch wars, he said, and was documented appearing the following century on American lifeboats.\n\nSuch usage of the American flag was codified in the U.S. flag code, first drafted in 1923, which set guidelines regarding the American flag, noted Paulson of the Free Speech Center. The code, which is not legally enforceable, says that the flag should never be displayed upside-down \u201cexcept as a signal of dire distress in instances of extreme danger to life or property.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a long history of American flag-flipping in political protest, too.\n\nAt an anti-slavery rally on July 4, 1854, in Massachusetts, abolitionist speakers William Lloyd Garrison, Sojourner Truth and Henry David Thoreau took to the stage under \"an inverted U.S. flag draped with black crepe,\" according to the Massachusetts Historical Society.\n\nIn the 1960s and '70s, the inverted U.S. flag emerged most prominently as a way to protest the Vietnam war.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nA student\u2019s display of a U.S. flag upside down with a peace sign taped to it \u2014 a protest of the killing of four Vietnam protesters by Ohio national guardsman at Kent State University \u2014 was the focus of a 1974 Supreme Court case that ruled he had the constitutional right to do so.\n\nIn 1972, Vietnam veteran John Kerry was running for Congress when he faced backlash for having published a book with cover art showing veterans hoisting a U.S. flag upside down. His congressional campaign at the time defended the image as a display of the international signal of distress.\n\nJustice Alito\u2019s wife in 2021 also explained the upside-down flag on her lawn as \u201can international signal of distress,\u201d The Washington Post reported.\n\nAs a form of protest, the flag doesn't signal distress so much as anger at a perceived deterioration of promised American principles, according to political extremism researcher Johnson.\n\n\u201cWe place a lot of description of this upside-down flag as being a symbol of distress,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened is it shifted from that to an expression of outrage \u2014 a signal to say, 'America has abrogated its own principles and values and I am sending a signal that I disagree' or 'I see this as a violation of American values.' \u201d\n\nThat\u2019s how it\u2019s been used in Black Lives Matter and abortion rights protests, she said.\n\n\n\nA partisan shift\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until the Obama administration that right-wing fringe groups started to visibly embrace the inverted American flag, according to Johnson. After President Obama\u2019s reelection, conservative Tea Party advocates expressed their disappointment by waving flipped flags.\n\ntoggle caption Jacquelyn Martin/AP\n\n\u201cIn a lot of these other protest movements, it's a one-off where a person will be carrying an upside-down flag to express their personal belief,\u201d she said. \u201cIt's not as if you show up to a \u2018pro-choice\u2019 rally you're going to see hundreds of upside-down flags.\u201d\n\nSponsor Message\n\nRight-wing extremist movements, however, which have historically been invested in flag culture and symbology, have in recent years taken to using the upside-down flag in a more consistent fashion.\n\nThe white nationalist group Patriot Front, for example, is known for showing up to protests bearing the upside-down U.S. flags en masse.\n\nWithin the umbrella of the extreme right groups, Johnson said there\u2019s a distinction between those who might turn their American flags upside down versus those who would not.\n\n\u201cThere are people who [consider themselves] ultra-patriots \u2014 who think of themselves as defending American principles and institutions from corruption. There are also those who seek to actually overthrow the U.S. democratic system entirely because they don't believe in democracy,\" she said. \"That second sect don't typically use the upside-down flags, but the first sect who view themselves as ultra-patriots do.\u201d",

        "text": "Biden to sign executive order to close southern US border to asylum seekers\nJoe Biden will this week sign an executive order to temporarily close the southern US border to asylum seekers in a sharp political U-turn aimed at winning support on a key voter concern in a presidential election year.\n\nThe US president is expected to sign the order as early as Tuesday to seal the border with Mexico to migrants when numbers of asylum claimants rise above a daily threshold of 2,500.\n\nMayors of several US border cities are expected to be present in the White House for Biden\u2019s announcement.\n\nBiden\u2019s move echoes a similar approach adopted by Donald Trump in 2018 when he was president and reverses his one-time philosophical opposition to his predecessor\u2019s hostility to migrants. When he was a presidential candidate, Biden denounced Trump\u2019s policy, saying it upended decades of US asylum law.\n\nHe has been forced to change course as the number of asylum seekers coming through the US-Mexico border has surged during his presidency, with opinion polls consistently showing immigration to be at or near the top of voters\u2019 concerns, ahead of inflation and the economy.\n\nAn attempt by the White House to cobble together legislation tightening border restrictions by tying it to aid to Ukraine and Israel failed earlier this year after Republican lawmakers withdrew support, apparently at the urging of Trump, who did not want Biden to claim credit for resolving an issue he has attempted to make his own.\n\nAccording to CBS, which broke the story, Biden\u2019s executive order will enable US immigration officials to quickly deport migrants who enter the country illegally without processing their asylum claims.\n\nControversially, it will rely on a presidential authority known as 212 (f) which became infamous during Trump\u2019s presidency because of its use to enforce certain immigration restrictions, including travel bans from Muslim countries.\n\nLike Trump\u2019s restrictions, Biden\u2019s order is likely to face legal challenges.\n\nMigration at the southern border surged to record numbers at the end of last year. Buthe order comes at a moment when the number of migrants crossing from Mexico is down in the past six months, a trend attributed to stronger enforcement on the part of the Mexican authorities but which is not expected to sustain itself.\n\nAn estimated 179,000 \u201cborder encounters\u201d were recorded in April, according to US Customs and Border Protection figures, compared with a record high of 302,000 last December. More than 3,500 migrants were said to have crossed various points along the 2,000-mile border illegally on Sunday alone.\n\nBiden initially rolled back Trump\u2019s restrictive border policies after taking office in January 2021, issuing orders to freeze his predecessor\u2019s border wall construction and reissuing protections set up under the 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) scheme originally adopted by the Barack Obama White House.\n\nBiden suspended Trump\u2019s Remain in Mexico policy \u2013 whereby asylum seekers were forced to wait in Mexico while their US immigration claims were being considered \u2013 on the first day of his administration before the homeland security department formally cancelled it months later. The US supreme court subsequently upheld Biden\u2019s approach following a lower court ruling against it.\n\nWhen Trump\u2019s policy was in operation, Biden denounced it, saying: \u201cThis is the first president in the history of the United States of America [under whom] anybody seeking asylum has to do it in another country. That\u2019s never happened before.\u201d\n\nA recent Associated Press poll showed about two-thirds of voters, including 40% of Democrats, disapproved of Biden\u2019s handling of the southern border.",

The poll was conducted using Ipsos' KnowledgePanel.\n\nIn an election year, the votes of independents as well as those aligned with neither candidate are highly sought after by both campaigns. The votes could make a significant impact on the 2024 presidential race that will likely be decided at the margins, especially within crucial battleground states.\n\nOverall, 72% of Republicans, 6% of Democrats and 23% of independents have a favorable view of Trump following his conviction.\n\nFor Biden, 4% of Republicans have a favorable view of him after Trump's conviction, while 72% of Democrats and 24% of independents do.\n\nFormer President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump leaves Manhattan Criminal Court after he was convicted in his criminal trial in New York,.

Charly Triballeau/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe poll also found that 50% of Americans think Trump's verdict was correct; 27% said it was not and 23% responded that they don't know.\n\nAlmost half -- 49% -- of the country said they think Trump should end his campaign based on just the verdict, the ABC News/Ipsos poll found. One in six Republicans -- 16% -- said Trump should end his campaign because of his conviction. More than three-quarters -- 79% -- of Democrats think he should suspend his bid, according to the poll.\n\nAnother poll from Reuters/Ipsos that came out Friday tracked the immediate political fallout of the verdict.\n\nThat poll found that more than half of registered voters said the verdict does not impact their likelihood of voting for Trump, but that around one in 10 Republican voters said it makes them much or somewhat less likely to vote for him.\n\nAmong independents, 16% said Trump's guilty verdict makes them more likely to vote for him, but 26% said it made them less likely to vote for him. Fifty-eight percent said the conviction would not influence their likelihood of voting for Trump.\n\nIn the Reuters/Ipsos poll, 11% of Republicans said that the conviction would make them less likely to vote for Trump.\n\nMETHODOLOGY\n\nThis ABC News/Ipsos poll was conducted using the probability-based Ipsos KnowledgePanel\u00ae May 31-June 1, 2024, in English and Spanish, among a random national sample of 781 U.S. adults. Results have a margin of sampling error of 3.7 points, including the design effect, for the full sample. Sampling error is not the only source of differences in polls. Partisan divisions are 31-29-32 percent, Democrats-Republicans-independents.

        "text": "PolitiFact FL: Can Trump still run for president or vote as a felon?\nWLRN has partnered with PolitiFact to fact-check Florida politicians. The Pulitzer Prize-winning team seeks to present the true facts, unaffected by agenda or biases.\n\nIn a landmark moment in U.S. political and legal history, a Manhattan jury on May 30 found former President Donald Trump guilty of multiple felony counts.\n\nA unanimous jury in the Manhattan case concluded that Trump was guilty of all 34 counts of falsifying business records in an alleged scheme to cover up a hush money payment to adult film actor Stormy Daniels before the 2016 presidential election.\n\nTrump, who was president from January 2017 to January 2021, has been the presumptive Republican nominee against the incumbent Democratic president, Joe Biden. It\u2019s unclear how the 34-count conviction could affect the presidential race. But, no matter what happens, Trump is still allowed to run for president.\n\nSentencing is to come July 11, four days before the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, where Trump is slated to be formally nominated as the party\u2019s presidential candidate.\n\nThe Manhattan case is the first of four Trump trials. Because of legal delays in two federal cases on documents and election interference and a Georgia election interference case, it may end up being the only trial to reach a jury verdict before November\u2019s election. Trump is expected to appeal his conviction.\n\nThe jury deliberated for about 10 hours over two days.\n\nIn brief remarks at the courthouse following the verdict, Trump repeated his view that the process was \"rigged\" and promised to \"fight to the end.\" He has regularly described the prosecution as politically motivated and complained that it was being held in New York City, a jurisdiction that overwhelmingly voted for Biden in 2020.\n\nHere\u2019s what we know about what could happen next.\n\nSince Trump has been convicted, when will sentencing occur?\n\nSentencing is scheduled for July 11 in the Manhattan courthouse and will be overseen by Judge Juan Merchan, who presided over the trial.\n\nHow would an appeal of the guilty verdict play out?\n\nTrump has said he will appeal. The appeal process would probably extend beyond Election Day.\n\nTrump has 30 days to state in writing that he will appeal. He would have months more to file his actual appeal, said Karen Friedman Agnifilo, criminal defense attorney and former executive chief of the trial division and chief assistant district attorney at the Manhattan District attorney\u2019s office. Once the appeal is filed, it would still take additional months before the appeals court hears oral arguments and potentially months more before the court renders a decision.\n\nIt would not be unusual for the process to take a year or more, experts said.\n\nIs Trump likely to receive a jail sentence?\n\nAn analysis by Norman L. Eisen, who was a counsel for Trump\u2019s first impeachment and trial, calculated that during Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg\u2019s first year in office, his team alone filed 166 felony counts for falsifying business records against 34 people or companies. Eisen found that approximately 1 in 10 cases in which the most serious charge was falsifying business records in the first degree resulted in some term of imprisonment. But he cautioned that other charges may have tipped the scales toward incarceration in some of those prior sentences.\n\nMerchan\u2019s potential decision on sentencing in the Manhattan case is anyone\u2019s guess. Working in Trump\u2019s favor is that he doesn\u2019t have prior convictions and the charges are a low-level nonviolent felony, legal experts said. Working against Trump is that he has been held in contempt multiple times for breaching a gag order.\n\nWill Trump still have Secret Service protection if he goes to prison?\n\nThe Secret Service, which handles former presidents\u2019 security, has been planning for the possibility of Trump\u2019s incarceration for gag order violations or a postconviction sentence, The New York Times, CBS and ABC have reported.\n\n\"For all settings around the world, the U.S. Secret Service studies locations and develops comprehensive and layered protective models that incorporate state of the art technology, protective intelligence and advanced security tactics to safeguard those we protect,\" Special Agent Joe Routh told PolitiFact before the verdict. \"In order to maintain operational security, we do not comment on specific protective operations.\"\n\nCould Biden pardon him? Could Trump pardon himself?\n\nBecause Trump was convicted on state charges, Biden cannot pardon him. The president can pardon only for federal charges, Michigan State University law professor Brian Kalt said.\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul could possibly pardon Trump, Kalt added, but that likelihood is considered low because she is a Democrat.\n\nTrump couldn\u2019t pardon himself if he regains the presidency for the same reason that Biden can\u2019t. (It\u2019s also unclear at best whether presidents could pardon themselves for a federal crime, legal experts said.)\n\nCan Trump still run for president after his conviction?\n\nYes. The U.S. Constitution upholds the principle that voters decide who should represent them, and its qualifications are limited to natural-born citizenship, age (35 by Inauguration Day) and residency in the United States (14 years).\n\nFelons have run for president in the past. Lyndon LaRouche was convicted in 1988 of tax and mail fraud conspiracy and ran for president multiple times between 1976 and 2004. Eugene Debs was convicted of violating the Espionage Act of 1917 for an anti-war speech, then ran for president under the Socialist Party banner from a federal prison in Alabama in 1920.\n\nWill Trump lose his voting rights?\n\nThat\u2019s unlikely.\n\nTrump is a registered voter in Palm Beach County. The Florida Department of State website states that \"a felony conviction in another state makes a person ineligible to vote in Florida only if the conviction would make the person ineligible to vote in the state where the person was convicted.\"\n\nNew York law passed a law in 2021 that restores voting rights for people convicted of felonies upon their release from prison. Voters don\u2019t lose their right to vote unless they are in prison serving a sentence for a felony conviction. People whose prison sentences are stayed pending appeal do not lose their voting rights.\n\nWhat\u2019s the status of the other criminal cases against Trump?\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely that the other criminal cases will go to trial before Election Day.\n\nThe federal election interference case has been paused because of Trump\u2019s claims of presidential immunity. The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule on that case by early July.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s decision would not affect the New York case because much of the alleged conduct occurred before Trump was president.\n\nThe trial for the federal classified documents was set to start in Florida in May. But the judge postponed the date amid legal motions that she has yet to rule on. She has not set a new date.\n\nIn Georgia, an appeals court agreed May 8 to review a lower court ruling that Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis can continue to prosecute Trump. That decision makes it less likely the case will reach trial before November.\n\nPolitiFact Senior Correspondent Amy Sherman contributed to this article.\n\nOur Sources\n\nCopyright 2024 WLRN 91.3 FM",

        "summary": " Mexico's first female president is also its first Jewish president . Claudia Sheinbaum, 61, is not religiously observant, but identifies as culturally Jewish . An estimated 50,000 Jews live in Mexico, mostly Catholic, with nearly 100 million Catholics and 14 million Protestants .",
        "text": "Mexico's first female president is also its first Jewish president\nClaudia Sheinbaum didn't just make history when she was elected Mexico's first female president.\n\nShe will also be the first Jewish president in a country with one of the largest Catholic populations in the world. Though she's not religiously observant, Sheinbaum identifies as culturally Jewish and has spoken about her heritage in the past.\n\n\u201cI grew up without religion. That\u2019s how my parents raised me,\u201d Sheinbaum, 61, said in 2018 at gathering hosted by a Jewish organization in Mexico City. \u201cBut obviously the culture, that\u2019s in your blood.\u201d\n\nHer maternal grandparents were Jews who immigrated to Mexico from Bulgaria before the Holocaust, while her paternal grandparents had fled from Lithuania in the 1920s. Sheinbaum's parents were born in Mexico.\n\nWhile campaigning, Sheinbaum said she considers herself a woman of faith but is not religiously affiliated; perhaps that's why there has been relatively little discussion about her becoming Mexico's first Jewish president.\n\nTessy Schlosser, a historian and director of the Mexican Jewish Documentation and Research Center in Mexico City, said that for Mexicans of Jewish heritage, approval and expectations of Sheinbaum\u2019s government seem to align more with \"her personal political preferences than with her Jewish ancestry.\"\n\nEven Jewish newspapers in Mexico mostly focused on her historic win as the first woman to lead the country, barely mentioning her Jewish background.\n\n\"Sheinbaum, whose [ancestors] immigrated to Mexico escaping poverty and antisemitism, including the Holocaust, grew up in a secular, science-driven household. She doesn\u2019t perform her Jewish identity in public,\" said author and Amherst University humanities professor Ilan Stavans, who is also Mexican and Jewish and has written extensively about the Jewish diaspora in Latin America.\n\nSheinbaum was a physicist and climate scientist before she went into politics; her father was a chemical engineer, and her mother was a cell biologist.\n\n'Part of Mexican Jewish tradition'\n\nStill, Sheinbaum's ascent to the presidency is significant, Stavans said.\n\n\u201cThe election of Claudia Sheinbaum as Mexico\u2019s first female Jewish president is a benchmark for the Jews of Latin America, whose presence in the region goes back to the arrival of Columbus and his crew at the end of the 15th century,\u201d Stavans said.\n\nHer election has opened a door toward a greater understanding of the history of Jews in Mexico, especially after local political figures used her heritage to launch attacks against Sheinbaum, questioning whether she was born in Mexico or was even Mexican.\n\nAn estimated 50,000 Jewish people live in Mexico. The majority are settled in Mexico City and its surroundings, with small communities in the cities of Monterrey, Guadalajara, Tijuana, Canc\u00fan, San Miguel de Allende and Los Cabos.\n\nThe first Jews arrived in Mexico in 1519, along with the Spanish colonization. The community began to grow substantially by the early 20th century, as thousands of Jews fled from the Ottoman Empire to escape instability and antisemitism.\n\nThe Mexican Jewish community is formed by Ashkenazi Jews, from Central and Eastern Europe, and Sephardic Jews, mainly from Turkey, Greece, Italy, Spain and Syria.\n\n\u201cJewish identity encompasses many areas, including cultural, not just religious. Under these parameters, although Sheinbaum is not part of the organized Jewish community, her family\u2019s history is part of Mexican Jewish tradition and history, as she herself assumes,\u201d Schlosser said in Spanish.\n\nMexico remains overwhelmingly Christian, with nearly 100 million Catholics and 14 million Protestants, according to a 2020 census.\n\nSheinbaum's win also comes at a critical time as the war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip has displaced more than 1 million Palestinians and left more than 35,000 people dead, according to officials in Gaza.\n\nSince the beginning of the war last year, Sheinbaum has condemned attacks on civilians. She even called for a cease-fire and said she supports a two-state solution.\n\nHer stance echoed views she wrote in a 2009 letter to the editor of La Jornada, a Mexican newspaper, condemning what Sheinbaum described as \u201cthe murder of Palestinian civilians\u201d during an Israeli bombing campaign in the Gaza Strip.\n\n\"Her loyalties are with the oppressed and downtrodden. In the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, she sides with the former without rejecting the latter, favoring a two-state solution, which these days appears more untenable that in recent memory,\" Stavans said.\n\nSheinbaum begins her six-year presidential term on Oct. 1.\n\n\"Her sheer arrival\" to the presidency, Stavans said, will generate interest in Jewish Latin Americans' rich history and culture.\n\nNicole Acevedo and Arturo Conde reported from New York and Albinson Linares from Mexico City.",

        "text": "Will abortion decide the 2024 elections?\nThe House Majority PAC has started a $100 million fund focused on abortion rights in the party's latest effort to win votes as Republicans hammer issues like the economy and immigration, according to The Wall Street Journal. The PAC, which supports Democrats' push to take back the House, told donors the Reproductive Freedom Accountability Fund would be used for advertising and get-out-the-vote campaigns in swing districts and competitive House races.\n\nDemocrats are betting their advocacy for reproductive rights, which Americans support in polls, will help them erase the GOP's razor-thin majority in the House and help President Joe Biden overcome a polling slump that puts him behind Donald Trump. As president, the Republican challenger bolstered the conservative Supreme Court majority that overturned the abortion-rights protections of Roe v. Wade. Trump, like other Republicans, backs limits on abortion. Could this be the issue that decides which party fares better in November?\n\nAbortion tips the scales to Democrats\n\nAbortion has \"played to Democrats' considerable advantage\" ever since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade nearly two years ago, said Mark Z. Barabak in the Los Angeles Times. After the sudden loss of a \"50-year-old constitutional right to abortion,\" it \"helped the party avoid a widely predicted wipeout in the 2022 midterm elections\" and forced Trump and other Republicans to twist themselves into knots trying to satisfy conservatives without \"alienating\" the pro-abortion rights majority. The issue could motivate voters who are not crazy about Biden to vote for the incumbent anyway. That \"could make all the difference\" in a close race.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber. Get the facts behind the news, plus analysis from multiple perspectives.

That is especially true in states like Florida, where a proposed state constitutional amendment to \"establish a right to abortion before viability\" could attract people angry about post-Roe restrictions to the polls. But \"righteous anger and grief over the loss of reproductive freedom in Florida\" might \"not be enough to revive the state's Democratic Party\" or keep Trump from winning Florida's electoral votes. Political analysts say many Republicans might vote for the constitutional amendment \"but reject Democrats,\" including Biden. It will take more than one issue to \"build a lasting political coalition\" in places like Florida where Republicans have gained the upper hand.\n\nThe economy and inflation could matter more\n\nGeorgia's state Supreme Court election provided the latest indication abortion \"may not be the silver bullet\" Democrats think it is, said Henry Olsen at National Review. The party thought former Democratic congressman John Barrow, who \"argued that the state constitution guaranteed a right to abortion,\" had a good chance to unseat Andrew Pinson, a state Supreme Court justice appointed by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp. But Pinson demolished Barrow by 10 percentage points, a bigger margin than in Stacey Abrams' loss to Kemp in 2022. \"This is not a sign that support for abortion rights will swing red voters over to Team Blue.\" Polls have shown \"inflation, the economy and immigration remain of greater import to voters, especially independent voters.\"\n\nIt still is hard to say how the abortion rights issue will play out on a national scale this November, said the Newsday editorial board. Since the Supreme Court's 2022 decision in Dobbs v. Jackson, which \"upheld a Mississippi law banning most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy,\" changed the abortion landscape, \"the procedure has been banned in some states while access to it expanded in others. The tumultuous five-decade legal and political struggle over the government's involvement in the outcome of a woman's pregnancy continues unabated.\" Trump, who picked three of the justices in the high court's 6-3 conservative majority that overturned Roe, took \"credit for the great reversal\" but has had trouble \"finding a popular footing on the issue in his bid for a second term.\" Two years after the Supreme Court told the nation, \"'You decide,' the question is being called for a vote.\"",

        "text": "How TikTok Could Decide the 2024 Election\nShare Copy Link \u2713 Link copied to clipboard!\n\nThe most divisive, yet highly popular social media platform is shaping up to become one of the biggest factors in this year's presidential election.\n\nDespite widespread criticisms about TikTok from both sides of the aisle, the presumptive Democratic and Republican nominees are signaling that the Chinese-owned app will be critical to reaching voters, especially young ones, ahead of November.\n\nPresident Joe Biden and former president Donald Trump have both called for a ban on TikTok, yet both men now have accounts on the fastest-growing social platform in America. On Saturday night, Trump\u2014who once tried to ban TikTok in the U.S. with an executive order\u2014launched his personal account with a 13-second video in which UFC President Dana White declared, \"The president is now on TikTok.\"\n\nIn less than 24 hours, the former president amassed over 2 million followers on the app. As of Tuesday morning, he has 5 million followers. His sole post on the platform has been viewed over 78 million times.\n\n\"For better or worse, 2024 will be the TikTok election,\" James Haggerty, president and CEO of strategic communications firm PRCG, told Newsweek. \"It may be banned in 2025, but for the 2024 election TikTok ain't going nowhere.\"\n\nFormer president Donald Trump and President Joe Biden. Both have TikTok accounts, despite being critical of the app's Chinese ownership, underscoring the importance of the platform in the 2024 election. Former president Donald Trump and President Joe Biden.

Seth Wenig/Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nTrump isn't the only presidential candidate to reverse his position on TikTok. After months of steering clear of the controversial app over privacy and national security concerns related to TikTok's Chinese ownership, the Biden campaign gave in and joined the platform, posting its first TikTok with the caption \"lol hey guys\" during this year's Super Bowl.\n\nEven after Biden signed a law in April that would ban TikTok nationwide if its Beijing-based parent company, ByteDance, doesn't sell it by January 2025, his reelection campaign said it plans to keep using the app until Election Day.\n\n\"A fragmented media environment requires us to show up and meet voters where they are\u2014and that includes online,\" the Biden campaign said in a statement. \"TikTok is one of many places we're making sure our content is being seen by voters.\"\n\nWhen approached by Newsweek, the Biden campaign said it has \"a robust operation to reach young voters and move them to the polls\" and has \"built a deep bench of trusted messengers across social media platforms which dates back to 2020...and is continuing to grow now.\"\n\nThe Trump campaign also defended the presumptive GOP nominee after he joined TikTok over the weekend, saying in a statement: \"We will leave no front undefended and this represents the continued outreach to a younger audience consuming pro-Trump and anti-Biden content.\"\n\nNewsweek reached out to the Trump and Biden campaigns for additional comment.\n\nPolitical consultant Jay Townsend told Newsweek that while both candidates have criticized TikTok and its ownership, it's clear both campaigns have come to the conclusion that the app is critical to reaching young voters.\n\n\"Both candidates feel compelled to speak to younger voters, which means that both camps are nervous about the younger demographic that has come of age the last eight years,\" Townsend said. \"As a group, they are far more independent than their elders, more likely to be unaffiliated with either party, disengaged, and up for grabs. In politics you have to meet your voters where they are.\"\n\nAs of March 21, TikTok boasts 150 million active users in the U.S. But there's also a glaring generational gap in its user base. A Pew Research Center survey released in January found that 62 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds use TikTok, compared to only 10 percent of those 65 years and older. Facebook has an estimated 243 million U.S. accounts.\n\nIn 2024, Gen Z youth alone will make up over 40 million potential voters and nearly one fifth of the American electorate, according to a survey by the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE). The poll conducted between October 25 and November 2, found that 57 percent of 18- to 34-year-olds say they're \"extremely likely\" to vote in this year's presidential election, but that only 19 percent have heard from political parties or campaigns.\n\nThe CIRCLE survey showed that 51 percent of youth voters were extremely likely to back the Democratic candidate and that only 30 percent were extremely likely to back the Republican candidate, but recent polls show that Trump may be making gains among young people.\n\nThe Spring 2024 Harvard Youth Poll released in April found Biden leading Trump by a much narrower eight points, 45 percent to 37 percent, among voters under 30. Biden's lead is much larger among young women, 33 points compared to only 6 points among young men. The Democrat also does better among nonwhite voters under 30, leading 43 points among the demographic but only 3 points among white voters in the same age group.\n\n\"The Trump and Biden campaigns are both trying to figure out how to use TikTok effectively to peel off just enough of those younger voters who will be critical to putting them over the top,\" Haggerty said. \"Not that easy to do considering their candidates were both born before even television was common in U.S. homes.\"\n\nTikTok is also a popular platform for two other major voting demographics in this year's election. Nearly half of Hispanic adults report using TikTok, compared to 39 percent of Black adults, 29 percent of Asian adults and 28 percent of white adults. Women also use the platform at much higher rates than men, 40 percent to 25 percent.\n\nLatinos are the second-fastest growing racial and ethnic group in the U.S. electorate since the last presidential election, up 3.9 million since 2020, while rollbacks on reproductive rights, and subsequent referendums on abortion, have highlighted the importance of female voters.\n\n\"There is a new kid on the block that was not around four years ago,\" Townsend said of TikTok.\n\nBut while TikTok is poised to play a bigger role this year than in past elections, its rise may suggest something else. Dave Karpf, an associate professor at George Washington University specializing in digital media and politics, told Newsweek the popularity of TikTok \"mostly signals the continual decline of the other platforms.\"\n\n\"TikTok is filling the social media hole left by ex-Twitter,\" Karpf said, adding that there are bigger factors that shake up the presidential race.\n\n\"I do not expect that either campaign's use of TikTok will have much impact on the eventual election outcome,\" he predicted. \"Donald Trump's sentencing will be just four days before this year's Republican National Convention. That's unprecedented. The sheer fact of his conviction on 34 felony counts is going to be more impactful than any video clips his campaign decides to post to social media.\"\n\nUpdate 06/04/24, 11:17 a.m. ET: This story has been updated with comment from the Biden campaign.\n\nCorrection 06/05/24, 09:10 a.m. ET: The Latino figure in this story has been corrected.",

        "text": "Fact Sheet: Presidential Proclamation to Suspend and Limit Entry and Joint DHS-DOJ Interim Final Rule to Restrict Asylum During High Encounters at the Southern Border\nToday, the Biden-Harris Administration took decisive new action to strengthen border security, announcing a series of measures that restrict asylum eligibility, and significantly increase the consequences for those who enter without authorization across the southern border. These extraordinary steps, which will be in effect during times when high levels of encounters exceed our ability to deliver timely consequences, will make noncitizens who enter across the southern border ineligible for asylum with certain exceptions, raise the standard that is used to screen for certain protection claims, and speed up our ability to quickly remove those who do not qualify for protection.\n\nThese actions follow a series of steps that the Administration has taken over the past three years as it prepared for the end of the Title 42 public health Order, and since it was lifted last year, including surging personnel, infrastructure, and technology to the border, issuing the Circumvention of Lawful Pathways Rule, and referring record numbers of noncitizens into expedited removal. Over the past year, we have removed or returned more than three quarters of a million people, more than in any fiscal year since 2010. Despite these efforts, our outdated and broken immigration and asylum system, coupled with a lack of sufficient funding, make it impossible to quickly impose consequences on all noncitizens who cross irregularly and without a legal basis to remain in the United States.\n\nThe Administration has repeatedly called on Congress to provide the resources and legal authorities needed to secure our border. The measures announced today will better enable the Department to quickly remove individuals without a legal basis to remain in the United States, strengthening enforcement and change the calculus for those considering crossing our border irregularly. However, they are no substitute for Congressional action. We continue to call on Congress to provide the new tools and resources we have asked for to support the men and women on the frontlines.\n\nOverview\n\nPresident Biden issued a Presidential Proclamation to temporarily suspend the entry of noncitizens across the southern border. The Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General also jointly issued an interim final rule that, consistent with the Proclamation, generally restricts asylum eligibility for those who irregularly enter across the southern border \u2013 including the Southwest land and the southern coastal borders. The rule also limits fear screenings to those who manifest a fear or express a desire to file for protection and heightens the screening standard for statutory withholding and claims under the Convention Against Torture. Taken together, these measures will significantly increase the speed and scope of consequences for those who cross our borders irregularly or who attempt to present themselves at Ports of Entry without authorization, allowing the Departments to more quickly remove individuals who do not establish a legal basis to remain in the United States. The restriction on asylum eligibility will be discontinued when encounters fall below certain levels but will come back into effect if encounters rise again.\n\nProcess\n\nThe rule makes three key changes to current processing under Title 8 immigration authorities during periods of high border encounters:\n\nFirst, noncitizens who cross the southern border unlawfully or without authorization will generally be ineligible for asylum, absent exceptionally compelling circumstances and unless they are excepted by the Proclamation.\n\nSecond, noncitizens who cross the southern border and are processed for expedited removal while the limitation is in effect will only be referred for a credible fear screening with an Asylum Officer if they manifest or express a fear of return to their country or country of removal, a fear of persecution or torture, or an intention to apply for asylum.\n\nThird, the U.S. will continue to adhere to its international obligations and commitments by screening individuals who manifest a fear as noted above and do not qualify for an exception to the Rule for withholding of removal and Convention Against Torture protections at a reasonable probability of persecution or torture standard \u2013 a new, substantially higher standard than is currently applied under the Circumvention of Lawful Pathways rule.\n\nLike the Proclamation, the rule provides for an end to these enhanced measures following a sustained reduction in southern border encounters. Specifically, these measures are in effect until 14 calendar days after there has been a 7-consecutive-calendar-day average of less than 1,500 encounters between the ports of entry. The measures would again go into effect, or continue, as appropriate, when there has been a 7-consecutive-calendar-day average of 2,500 encounters or more.\n\nExceptions\n\nDuring periods of high encounters, the Proclamation will apply across the southern border. Lawful permanent residents, unaccompanied children, victims of a severe form of trafficking, and other noncitizens with a valid visa or other lawful permission to enter the United States are excepted from the Proclamation.\n\nIn addition, the suspension and limitation on entry and rule will not apply to noncitizens who use a Secretary-approved process\u2014such as the CBP One mobile app\u2014to enter the United States at a port of entry in a safe and orderly manner or pursue another lawful pathway.\n\nNoncitizens who cross the southern border and who are not excepted from the Proclamation will be ineligible for asylum unless exceptionally compelling circumstances exist, including if the noncitizen demonstrates that they or a member of their family with whom they are traveling:\n\nfaced an acute medical emergency;\n\nfaced an imminent and extreme threat to life or safety, such as an imminent threat of rape, kidnapping, torture, or murder; or\n\nsatisfied the definition of \u201cvictim of a severe form of trafficking in persons\u201d currently provided in 8 CFR 214.11.\n\nConsequences\n\nNoncitizens who are subject to the rule\u2019s limitation on asylum eligibility and who manifest or express a fear of return to their country or country of removal, express a fear of persecution or torture or an intention to apply for asylum, but do not establish a reasonable probability of persecution or torture in the country of removal will be promptly removed.\n\nThose ordered removed will be subject to at least a five-year bar to reentry and potential criminal prosecution.\n\nThe Proclamation and rule will significantly enhance the security of our border by increasing the Departments\u2019 ability to impose swift consequences for individuals who cross the southern border irregularly and do not establish a legal basis to remain in the United States. Together, the Proclamation and rule make critical changes to how the Departments operate during times when encounters are at historically high levels\u2014levels that, in the absence of these changes, undermine the government\u2019s ability to process individuals through the expedited removal process. These changes will enable the Departments to quickly return those without a lawful basis to stay in the United States and thereby free up the asylum system for those with legitimate claims.\n\nThese extraordinary measures are a stop gap. Even with these measures in place, the Departments continue to lack the authorities and resources needed to adequately support the men and women on the frontlines. The Administration again calls on Congress to take up and pass the bipartisan reforms proposed in the Senate, which provide the new authorities, personnel, and resources that are needed to address the historic global migration that is impacting countries throughout the world, including our own. Until Congress does its part, we will continue to take any actions needed under current law and within existing resources to secure the border.",

        "text": "What did experts learn from an \u2018unusual\u2019 US presidential primary season?\nAs the primary season comes to a close, analysts weigh in on what the results can tell us about the Biden-Trump rematch.\n\nIn a normal presidential election year in the United States, the primary season helps to winnow down the fields of Democratic and Republican candidates, until there is only one of each left.\n\nBut the 2024 primaries were different. Even before the first state vote was held, the outcome was clear: President Joe Biden was headed to a rematch against former President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cThis primary season was particularly unusual,\u201d Tim Hagle, a political science professor at the University of Iowa, said.\n\n\u201cIn part, that was because there seemed little doubt as to who would be the nominee for each party.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, the presidential primary season winds to an inconspicuous close, with low-stakes votes in the final four states: Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico and South Dakota, plus the District of Columbia. Only Guam and the Virgin Islands vote later.\n\nBut experts said the greatest takeaway from this year\u2019s presidential primaries was not who would ultimately nab each party\u2019s nomination. It was what each state-level vote revealed about the campaigns to come.\n\nTrump\u2019s \u2018death grip\u2019\n\nThe primary season began on January 15, when Iowa held its traditional first-in-the-nation caucus in the race for the Republican nomination.\n\nThe field of Republican candidates was initially broad. More than a dozen hopefuls launched a bid, ranging from Miami Mayor Francis Suarez to Trump\u2019s former Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nSome political observers speculated early on that Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, a rising conservative star, could challenge Trump for the Republican nomination.\n\nBut as the Iowa caucus approached, the polls were were clear: Trump maintained a seemingly insurmountable lead over all his challengers.\n\nA December survey from Reuters and Ipsos, for example, found that 61 percent of Republicans supported Trump. His next closest rivals, DeSantis and former United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley, only marshalled 11 percent each.\n\nAs a result, even before the first primary vote was cast, Republican candidates began dropping out of the race. Shortly after the Iowa caucus, the field contracted even more, leaving only Trump and Haley in the running for the second contest of the primary calendar, in New Hampshire.\n\nFor Steffen Schmidt, a political science professor at Iowa State University, the lesson was that little could dent Trump\u2019s standing among Republican voters.\n\nTrump, after all, faced four criminal indictments during the primary calendar. One of those indictments led to a trial that concluded last month with convictions on 34 felony counts, related to a hush-money payment made to an adult film star.\n\n\u201cWe have learned that court cases and extra-marital sex and \u2018payoffs\u2019 can\u2019t shake support by candidates with a passionate base,\u201d Schmidt told Al Jazeera.\n\nStill, Schmidt added that it was \u201cvery strange\u201d that a high-profile candidate like Trump can joke \u201cabout becoming a dictator\u201d \u2014 and face few repercussions at the ballot box.\n\nSome critics have pointed out that Haley\u2019s attempts to challenge Trump exposed weaknesses in the former president\u2019s bid for re-election. For instance, she beat Trump in two moderate-leaning areas, the District of Columbia and Vermont.\n\nAnd even after suspending her campaign in March, Haley continued to draw votes away from the Trump campaign. She scored 21 percent of the vote in Indiana\u2019s primary, and more than 16 percent in the pivotal swing state of Pennsylvania.\n\nWith November\u2019s presidential race likely to come down to a few key battleground states, those \u201czombie votes\u201d for Haley\u2019s long-defunct campaign were widely interpreted as a signal of displeasure with Trump.\n\nStill, months after leaving the race, Haley announced last month that she, too, would vote for Trump \u2014 an indication that even the former president\u2019s Republican critics were willing to back him.\n\n\u201cThe Republican primaries have taught us that Donald Trump has a death grip on his party,\u201d said Richard F Bensel, a professor of government at Cornell University.\n\n\u201dThere is no one in the party who can effectively stand up against him, and even his strongest opponents, such as Nikki Haley, have ultimately capitulated as they pursued their own individual ambitions.\u201d\n\nBiden \u2018difficult to replace\u2019\n\nOn the Democratic side, the protest vote has been even more prominent.\n\nBiden, the incumbent president, has faced backlash from within his own party over issues like Israel\u2019s war in Gaza and immigration. The Gaza war, in particular, spurred the formation of a protest movement centred on the primary season.\n\nStarting with February\u2019s Michigan primary, organisers pushed Democratic voters to select options like the \u201cuncommitted\u201d category on their ballots, rather than throw their support behind Biden.\n\nIn Michigan, the \u201cuncommitted\u201d movement nabbed nearly 101,000 votes and two party delegates out of a total of 117. In another key toss-up state, Wisconsin, the Democratic primary saw more than 47,800 voters cast ballots for the \u201cuninstructed\u201d category.\n\nCritics warned, as with Trump, that even small losses in support could have grave implications for November\u2019s general election.\n\nBut the protest vote had relatively little effect on the outcome of the primaries themselves.\n\nBiden was considered a shoo-in: No incumbent has ever lost in the modern primary system, and only once in US history has an elected incumbent failed to earn his party\u2019s nod.\n\n\u201cThe Democratic primaries have revealed, once more, that an incumbent president is very difficult to replace even when he is very unpopular,\u201d Bensel, the Cornell professor, told Al Jazeera.\n\nBensel added, \u201cIn a sense, the Democratic Party is walking a plank on what amounts to a sinking ship.\u201d\n\nA May poll from Reuters and Ipsos found that just 36 percent of Americans approved of Biden\u2019s job performance.\n\nStill, experts said no viable Democratic candidates emerged to challenge the president as he sought his second term.\n\nBefore the primaries even began, former environmental activist and conspiracy theorist Robert F Kennedy Jr withdrew from the Democratic race, running instead as an independent.\n\nThat left little-known contenders like self-help author Marianne Williamson and Representative Dean Phillips to compete against Biden in the primaries.\n\n\u201cIt was surprising that no Democrats who would be considered serious candidates were willing to challenge Biden,\u201d said Hagle, the University of Iowa professor. \u201cPerhaps it didn\u2019t seem as clear to Democrats that they will lose the general election in 2024, given that they believe they can beat Trump.\u201d\n\nDown to \u2018two unpopular, ageing politicians\u2019\n\nPolls currently show Biden and Trump in a tight race for the November election. Both have secured the number of delegates needed in the primary season to be their party\u2019s nominee.\n\nThe latest poll from Reuters and Ipsos found the two candidates \u201cstatistically tied if the election for president were held today\u201d. Biden held a slight lead, with 41 percent support to Trump\u2019s 39 percent.\n\nKen Kollman, a political science professor at the University of Michigan, said the primaries emphasised that \u2014 despite rumblings of discontent about the two candidates \u2014 they are both here to stay.\n\n\u201cAs much as many wanted otherwise, voters learned that these two unpopular, ageing politicians are not going away and that they are headed toward a massively consequential showdown in November,\u201d Kollman told Al Jazeera.\n\n\u201cBoth tenaciously held on to their leadership of their respective parties, and neither have escaped the divisions and lack of enthusiasm among portions of electorates within their parties.\u201d\n\nDennis J Goldford, a political science professor at Drake University, echoed that sentiment.\n\nHe told Al Jazeera that both Democrats and Republicans emerged from the primaries \u201cwith a nominee who does not excite a majority of each party\u201d.\n\nBut he underscored that there is a limit to how predictive primaries are for the general election. The number of voters who cast ballots in primaries and caucuses can be comparatively low.\n\n\u201cAmericans talk a lot about the right to vote, but we don\u2019t really mean it. On a national basis, we get perhaps a 60-percent turnout for presidential elections, a 40-percent turnout for midterm elections and a 20-percent turnout for primaries,\u201d Goldford said.\n\nHe added that many voting trends have remained consistent in the presidential race so far.\n\n\u201cRepublicans take voting more seriously than Democrats; older people take voting more seriously than younger people; and partisans take voting more seriously than independents,\u201d Goldford explained.\n\nBut, he added, there could be some shifts ahead in traditional voting blocs. \u201cThe interesting question is whether the supposed movement of traditional Democratic constituencies \u2014 Blacks and Latinos \u2014 toward Trump is real.\u201d\n\nUltimately, many of the experts who spoke to Al Jazeera said the unusual primary season is a symptom of an unusual presidential race overall.\n\nNever before has a former US president faced criminal charges \u2014 much less during an election cycle. And the last time the presidential election was a rematch of the previous race was in 1956.\n\nFor Schmidt, election forecasts function like weather forecasts: \u201cPredicting depends on continuity and some replication of the past.\u201d\n\nBut this year? \u201cWe have none of that.\u201d",

Ginnette Riquelme/AP\n\nWith more than 98 million eligible voters, some 70,000 candidates and over 20,000 public offices being contested, Mexico\u2019s general election Sunday is the largest in the country\u2019s history.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just the massive scale of the event that makes it so important in the eyes of observers across the border in the United States.\n\nFor the first time in history, the country looks set to elect its first female president. The two front-runners are both women \u2013 Claudia Sheinbaum, of the Morena party, who is backed by the governing coalition Sigamos Haciendo Historia, and X\u00f3chitl G\u00e1lvez, who is backed by a coalition of opposition parties.\n\nThe vote is also important because it falls in the same year as the US presidential election \u2013 something that happens only once every 12 years \u2013 and comes at a time of transition in the relationship between the two countries.\n\n\u201cThe years when all the US wanted was a safe and stable Mexico are over. Now it is also interested in a country with good public policy,\u201d said Rafael Fern\u00e1ndez de Castro Medina, director of the Center for US-Mexico Studies at the University of California, San Diego, pointing to the increasing number of Latinos in the US and the two countries\u2019 growing ties.\n\nHere are a look at some of the biggest issues affecting the US-Mexico relationship that will be influenced by Sunday\u2019s vote:\n\nEconomy: Mexico became the United States\u2019 top trading partner last year, surpassing China and Canada. Experts say this is largely because geopolitical issues such as the pandemic, the legacy of Trump\u2019s trade war against China, and the war in Ukraine all encouraged near-shoring \u2013 the relocation of supply chains nearer to home \u2013 which boosted US imports from Mexico and its investment in the country.\n\nMigration: While migration across the countries\u2019 1,933 miles long border is a shared concern, the issue is much lower on Mexican politicians\u2019 agenda than in the US \u2014 where it could be a decisive factor in the November vote, according to Carin Zissis, editor-in-chief of the Americas Society/Council of the Americas website. \u201cThe speeches of Sheinbaum and G\u00e1lvez on migration are neither very strong nor very different from each other, nor do they address too much what to do with migrants in the country,\u201d she said. The rub for US politicians is that they need buy-in from their Mexican counterparts if their own immigration policies are to succeed.\n\nFentanyl and the drug trade: Security is another pillar of the bilateral relationship, particularly in terms of the thriving cross-border drug trade that blights both countries. While the United States has been grappling with a domestic health crisis due to the amount of fentanyl on its streets, Mexico faces increasing cartel-linked violence \u2013 including in the run-up to the election which has been marred by dozens of assassination attempts and other political violence.\n\nRead the full analysis here.",

Here\u2019s what to know about Mexico\u2019s next president\n\nBut for some analysts it mostly comes down to three things: money, dialogue and the outcome of the U.S. presidential election.\n\nClaudia Sheinbaum, who begins her six-year presidential term Oct. 1, has four months ahead of her to define her administration\u2019s agenda. During this time, L\u00f3pez Obrador is expected to continue delivering his daily morning press briefings as he tries to solidify his legacy.\n\nThe coexistence might be far from easy: He has divided society; she says she wants to unite it. He is a leader of the masses; she is an academic and a scientist.\n\nL\u00f3pez Obrador has said he will not interfere with his protege\u2019s administration. \u201cI do not aspire to be a \u2018moral leader,\u2019 a \u2018maximum boss,\u2019 a \u2018caudillo,\u2019\u201d he said Monday.\n\nHe has insisted that once his presidency is over, he is going to \u201ctalk with the trees, live with the birds.\u201d Yet, it was he who announced Monday that current Treasury Secretary Rogelio Ram\u00edrez de la O would remain in his post through the next administration in a bid to avoid a market meltdown.\n\nThe balance between continuity and change will not be simple.\n\nA top economic challenge will be whether Sheinbaum will have the money to continue her predecessor\u2019s popular social programs, considering the government has a big deficit of almost 6% that the Treasury has vowed to reduce.\n\n\u201cThere needs to be fiscal reform,\u201d said Isidro Morales, an economics and international relations expert. Otherwise, he warns, citing Mexico\u2019s decreasing oil income as one problem, \u201cClaudia is going to have her hands tied.\u201d\n\nMexico\u2019s state-owned oil company Pemex is L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s most fervent symbol of nationalism, but it continues to lose money and oil is far from the primary revenue stream it once was. Yet, it is a red line for Sheinbaum who, despite being a climate scientist who wants to move into clean energy, closed her campaign last week before gigantic banners of support from oil industry workers.\n\nMexico\u2019s presidential transition also happens to fall right into the heart of the U.S. presidential campaign.\n\n\u201cMexico\u2019s most important election is taking place on Nov. 5,\u201d said Carlos A. P\u00e9rez Ricart, a professor at Mexican public research center CIDE, referring to the U.S. presidential election.\n\nPresident Joe Biden\u2019s reelection or the return to power of former President Donald Trump will be \u201cthe real variable that will change scenarios,\u201d P\u00e9rez Ricard said. The outcome could not only influence security, trade and immigration policies, but also many internal decisions about the role of Mexico\u2019s army, he said.\n\nSheinbaum studied in the U.S., speaks English and understands that country\u2019s politics, which would lead one to think there would be more understanding with Washington, but no one can control the Trump factor.\n\nAnd when it comes to immigration and security, Mexico\u2019s new president is left only with the existing policies, which have only intermittently slowed migration to the U.S. border and failed to significantly lower Mexico\u2019s persistent violence.\n\nREAD MORE: These are the pressing gender-related issues facing Mexico\u2019s next president\n\nTo confront Mexico\u2019s increasing violence, analysts have said the country needs to strengthen civilian police and prosecutor\u2019s offices. Instead, L\u00f3pez Obrador opted for militarizing the country, giving the armed forces unprecedented power in a bevy of civilian areas \u2014 from domestic security to construction \u2014 with the risks to human rights and accountability that implies.\n\nIt remains unclear what Sheinbaum will want from the military, what she could change or what kind of pressure the military could bring to bear on her.\n\nPolitically, her Morena party\u2019s congressional majority could be a double-edged sword.\n\nFor the approximately 40% of voters who did not support her, it will be seen as dangerous because if preliminary results hold up, she could have enough lawmakers to amend the constitution. L\u00f3pez Obrador has floated a host of controversial constitutional proposals, including eliminating institutions that provide checks on executive power and on subjecting judges to public elections.\n\nIt will be key that Mexico has a strong government that unquestionably defends the separation of powers, P\u00e9rez Ricart said.\n\nPolitical scientist Luis Miguel P\u00e9rez Ju\u00e1rez, however, argues that Sunday\u2019s strong victory gives Sheinbaum \u201cenormous power\u201d for independent action, including from the party L\u00f3pez Obrador created.\n\n\u201cShe will not have to go to anyone,\u201d he said.",

        "text": "Column: What Mexico\u2019s historic presidential election can teach the U.S.\nOf the many terrible things that have been said about Mexico\u2019s supposed inferiority to its northern neighbor, the most damning wasn\u2019t even uttered by a gringo.\n\n\u201cPoor Mexico: So far from God, so close to the United States.\u201d\n\nAttributed to 19th century Mexican dictator Porfirio D\u00edaz, the lament first bubbled up in the mainstream American press during the 1940s and has been rubbed in the faces of Mexicans ever since. Even though there\u2019s no proof that D\u00edaz actually said the apocryphal quote, I get why it has lingered: It\u2019s a great insult on multiple levels.\n\nIt portrays the country of my parents as forever lesser than the United States. It makes Mexico out to be lawless and unholy. Putting those words in D\u00edaz\u2019s mouth implies that Mexico\u2019s government is condemned to lawlessness and strongmen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, who\u2019s crying now?\n\nOn Sunday, Mexico elected Claudia Sheinbaum as president, and history was made in a way that makes American politics seem as antiquated as the Whigs.\n\nSheinbaum will become the first female president of a country long cast as a macho wasteland. Of Jewish heritage, she\u2019s the first non-Christian to assume the presidency in a nation where Catholicism still holds the country\u2019s psyche, if not its pews. She handily beat another woman, X\u00f3chitl G\u00e1lvez Ruiz, who made history even while losing by becoming Mexico\u2019s first female runner-up in a presidential election.\n\nThe United States, by the way, has broken only the last of those barriers.\n\nSheinbaum will be sworn in Oct. 1. By then, the eyes of the world will be focused on the U.S., where a far different presidential campaign will be wheezing to its end. The top candidates are two old white guys who have held the job before and are repeating their face-off from four years ago. Joe Biden is running on his fourth Democratic presidential ticket. Donald Trump is the Republican Party\u2019s presidential nominee for the third straight election.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s the type of hoary leadership that Americans have long associated with Third World countries \u2014 but nope, this is the U.S. in 2024.\n\nAmericans have snidely looked down on Mexico\u2019s government for decades while holding ours up as a beacon for the rest of the world to emulate. But in 2024, which country can boast of a better track record in its presidential milestones?\n\nMexico elected a Black president, Vicente Guerrero, in 1829, when the U.S. Constitution still considered a slave to be three-fifths of a person and didn\u2019t give freedmen the right to vote. The first Mexican president of Indigenous descent, Benito Juarez, assumed office in 1858, when the U.S. government was still pursuing a campaign of extermination against Native Americans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJosefina V\u00e1zquez Mota became the first female presidential candidate for a major Mexican party four years before Hillary Clinton became the first in the U.S. In 2018, current president Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador was the first winner who wasn\u2019t a member of Mexico\u2019s two traditional top parties, PAN and the PRI. In this country, candidates who aren\u2019t Democrats or Republicans are treated as weirdos who threaten civilization \u2014 as are the people who vote for them.\n\nIrma Selene Hernandez Atondo waits to vote Sunday outside the Mexican Consulate in Los Angeles. (Dania Maxwell / Los Angeles Times)\n\nThis weekend, consulates around the U.S. offered in-person voting for a Mexican presidential election for the first time but weren\u2019t prepared for the hours-long lines of people excited to take part. The turnout \u2014 60% so far \u2014 lags behind the 66% of Americans who voted in the 2020 presidential election. But most Mexicans filled out their ballots with optimism, while we did so with dread.\n\nMexico\u2019s democracy is nowhere near perfect, of course. Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna served a total of 11 terms as president, while D\u00edaz ruled with an iron fist for 35 years. For most of the 20th century, presidential elections were the domain of one party, the PRI. In the present day, violence against political candidates, particularly those running for local office, persists. At least 37 candidates were assassinated in the months leading up to Sunday\u2019s elections, and hundreds more were threatened, to the point that L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s administration assigned them security guards.\n\nSheinbaum needs to prove she\u2019s more than just an acolyte of her mentor, L\u00f3pez Obrador, whom critics portray as a leftist version of Trump for his cult of personality, imperious attitude toward haters and desire to hold onto power even if he\u2019s not officially in office. On social media, G\u00e1lvez complained that she faced \u201cunequal competition against the entire state apparatus dedicated to favoring its candidate,\u201d even as she conceded her defeat because \u201cI am a democrat and I believe in institutions.\u201d\n\nBut the fact remains: Mexico\u2019s democracy worked Sunday, at least on the presidential level. Mexicans treated the election as a chance to elect a new leader, not an apocalyptic referendum on the nation\u2019s future, the way that too many Americans view the Biden-Trump rematch. Despite her grumbling, G\u00e1lvez isn\u2019t crying about a stolen election \u2014 something that has actually happened in Mexico \u2014 while Trump continues to insist he was the rightful winner in 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSheinbaum\u2019s opponents aren\u2019t threatening an insurrection, as Trump supporters did on Jan. 6 by storming the Capitol. And never in Mexico\u2019s history has a convicted felon dared to run for the presidency, let alone with a shot of winning, as Trump now does.\n\nPoor Mexico, indeed. So close to the United States, which is so far from a democracy that inspires hope.",

        "text": "Mexico\u2019s next president faces 3 pressing challenges: money, dialogue and the US election\nMEXICO CITY (AP) \u2014 Mexico\u2019s newly elected president, the first woman to win the job, faces a long list of challenges, including persistent cartel violence, a deeply divided country, cash-straitened social programs and the long shadow of her mentor, outgoing President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador.\n\nBut for some analysts it mostly comes down to three things: money, dialogue and the outcome of the U.S. presidential election.\n\nClaudia Sheinbaum, who begins her six-year presidential term Oct. 1, has four months ahead of her to define her administration\u2019s agenda. During this time, L\u00f3pez Obrador is expected to continue delivering his daily morning press briefings as he tries to solidify his legacy.\n\nWho is Claudia Sheinbaum, Mexico\u2019s future first female president?\n\nThe coexistence might be far from easy: He has divided society; she says she wants to unite it. He is a leader of the masses; she is an academic and a scientist.\n\nL\u00f3pez Obrador has said he will not interfere with his protege\u2019s administration. \u201cI do not aspire to be a \u2018moral leader,\u2019 a \u2018maximum boss,\u2019 a \u2018caudillo,\u2019\u201d he said Monday.\n\nHe has insisted that once his presidency is over, he is going to \u201ctalk with the trees, live with the birds.\u201d Yet, it was he who announced Monday that current Treasury Secretary Rogelio Ram\u00edrez de la O would remain in his post through the next administration in a bid to avoid a market meltdown.\n\nThe balance between continuity and change will not be simple.\n\nCable cars glide over a polling station, right, during general elections in Mexico City, Sunday, June 2, 2024.

Otherwise, he warns, citing Mexico\u2019s decreasing oil income as one problem, \u201cClaudia is going to have her hands tied.\u201d\n\nMexico\u2019s state-owned oil company Pemex is L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s most fervent symbol of nationalism, but it continues to lose money and oil is far from the primary revenue stream it once was. Yet, it is a red line for Sheinbaum who, despite being a climate scientist who wants to move into clean energy, closed her campaign last week before gigantic banners of support from oil industry workers.\n\nA construction worker drive along the border walls separating Tijuana, Mexico, from the United States, Tuesday, June 4, 2024, in San Diego.

P\u00e9rez Ricart, a professor at Mexican public research center CIDE, referring to the U.S. presidential election.\n\nPresident Joe Biden\u2019s reelection or the return to power of former President Donald Trump will be \u201cthe real variable that will change scenarios,\u201d P\u00e9rez Ricard said. The outcome could not only influence security, trade and immigration policies, but also many internal decisions about the role of Mexico\u2019s army, he said.\n\nSheinbaum studied in the U.S., speaks English and understands that country\u2019s politics, which would lead one to think there would be more understanding with Washington, but no one can control the Trump factor.\n\nAnd when it comes to immigration and security, Mexico\u2019s new president is left only with the existing policies, which have only intermittently slowed migration to the U.S. border and failed to significantly lower Mexico\u2019s persistent violence.\n\nA group of migrants seeking asylum look for transportation options after being processed and released, Tuesday, June 4, 2024, in San Diego.

Instead, L\u00f3pez Obrador opted for militarizing the country, giving the armed forces unprecedented power in a bevy of civilian areas \u2014 from domestic security to construction \u2014 with the risks to human rights and accountability that implies.\n\nIt remains unclear what Sheinbaum will want from the military, what she could change or what kind of pressure the military could bring to bear on her.\n\nPolitically, her Morena party\u2019s congressional majority could be a double-edged sword.\n\nFor the approximately 40% of voters who did not support her, it will be seen as dangerous because if preliminary results hold up, she could have enough lawmakers to amend the constitution. L\u00f3pez Obrador has floated a host of controversial constitutional proposals, including eliminating institutions that provide checks on executive power and on subjecting judges to public elections.\n\nElectoral officials count ballots after polls closed during general elections in Mexico City, Sunday, June 2, 2024.

After this change, U.S.-Ukrainian dual citizens, including those who live in the United States, may no longer be able to depart the country.\n\nUkrainian law does not recognize dual citizenship. U.S.-Ukrainian dual citizens are therefore treated solely as Ukrainian citizens while in Ukraine and are subject to the rights and obligations of Ukrainian citizens. Under Ukraine\u2019s martial law, men between the ages of 18 and 60 are not permitted to leave the country. Previously, dual U.S.-Ukrainian citizens in this group could enter and then depart Ukraine if they had deregistered their Ukrainian residency and registered their U.S. residency. According to our information, this exception was revoked as of June 1.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy is limited in our ability to influence Ukrainian law, including the application of martial law and the mobilization law to Ukrainian citizens. If you are in Ukraine and cannot leave the country, shelter in place and obey all local orders. If you are not currently in Ukraine, we strongly recommend against all travel to Ukraine by U.S. citizen males aged 18 to 60 who also have Ukrainian citizenship or a claim to Ukrainian citizenship and who do not wish to stay in Ukraine indefinitely. There is an extremely high risk you will not be allowed to depart, even with a U.S. passport.\n\nWe remind all Americans of the State Department\u2019s Level 4: Do Not Travel warning for Ukraine. For further information, see State Department websites for what you should know as a dual citizen traveler, and what we can and cannot do during a crisis.\n\nAssistance:",

        "text": "Meet 'double disapprovers': swing voters who could decide the presidential election\nMeet 'double disapprovers': swing voters who could decide the presidential election\n\nMany Americans say they do not want to vote for either President Biden or former President Trump this year.\n\nThese voters make up a critical part of the electorate this year \u2014 14 percent of respondents in the latest NPR/PBS/NEWSHOUR Marist poll say they are part of this demographic. Many live in swing states where even a small number of undecided voters could decide the winner of the Presidential election this year.\n\nTheir numbers are increasingly significant. The last time the \u2018double hater\u2019 or \u2018double disapprover\u2019 voting percentage was this high was 2016 between when Trump faced Democrat Hillary Clinton. That year broke decisively toward Trump. It was a much smaller slice in 2020, around 3%, but their ranks have expanded as President Biden\u2019s approval ratings have dropped.\n\nNPR wanted to know more about these voters and what, if anything, will help them decide who they will vote for this year.\n\nTo find out, NPR partnered with polling expert Rich Thau of the public opinion research firm Engagious and Sago, a market research firm. Thau talked to 12 voters, in two groups. All had switched their votes from Trump in 2016 to Biden in 2020, and they mostly reside in the swing states that will determine the 2024 election.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nWhat follows is a lightly-edited transcript of their conversation with Thau on May 23, 2024.\n\ntoggle caption Screenshot by NPR\n\n/Screenshot by NPR\n\nFocus Group #1 participants, clockwise from the top:\n\nEugene D., 43, Decatur, GA, software development, Independent; Robert K., 52, New Hope, MN, music instructor, Independent;Robert K., 63, Scottsdale, AZ, retired from software engineering, Independent; Cherlyn B., 48, Decatur, MI, homemaker, Republican; Nikaiya S., 45, Lansdowne, PA, lunch lady, Independent; Rich Thau, moderator; Asa H., 62, Monroe, NC, restaurant manager, Independent\n\nRich: Alright, we're going to go through a word association exercise. I'm going to mention a person and I want to hear the first thing that comes to mind when I mention this person's name. So let's start with President Biden for the first word or phrase that comes to mind when you hear President Biden. Everybody got one? Okay.\n\nCherlyn: Struggling.\n\nAsa: Concerned.\n\nRob: Senile.\n\nBob. Patriotic.\n\nNikaiya: Senile.\n\nEugene: Old.\n\nRich: Okay, next person. First thing that comes to mind. Former President Trump. Everybody have a word or a phrase that comes to mind? Don't overthink it. Just looking at the first thing that comes to mind.\n\nEugene: Jackass.\n\nBob: Unhinged.\n\nCherlyn: Not an option.\n\nNikaiya: Offensive.\n\nRich: Okay, so I want to go back to President Biden. Now, what if anything do you like about him? This doesn't have to be just a single word or a phrase just in a sentence or two. There's something you like about him.\n\nBob: I think he's got the best interest of the country at heart. I think that he puts the country before self. I think that in my opinion, that he's doing the best he can with a fractured Congress.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nEugene: I'm going to have to back up my friend Bob here. I think he's doing the best he can with what he's got to work with. And I honestly think he cares. He\u2019s probably got the best intentions of any politician in my lifetime.\n\nAsa: I would say struggling because as the other two gentlemen have already said, I think he's trying his best. I think he's very patriotic. I think he wants to do the right thing for the United States, but because of the way the Congress and the rest of the government is fractured, as we said, I think it's a big challenge for any president that goes into office with challenges like that.\n\nCherlyn: I like that conducts himself like an adult.\n\nRich: Let's go back to former President Trump. What if anything do you like about him?\n\nEugene: That he's no longer president.\n\nRich: I'm asking this as a straight ahead question. Snark free.\n\nEugene: Then nothing.\n\nBob: Some of his immigration policies.\n\nRob: His immigration policies and his understanding of China's economic undercutting of the US economy.\n\nNikaiya: Same, immigration policies. And what's crazy is the same things that I dislike about him, I like about him. I don't always agree with how honest he is, but I can respect it that way. It's out in the open.\n\nRich: Okay, let's go back to President Biden. What if anything do you dislike about him?\n\nRob: He turns every tragedy into a story about himself. I mean, I'm just like, how can you make it about you when other people died or some people were injured.\n\nCherlyn: He's just been around too long.\n\nEugene: It seems like he does what's politically expedient. He doesn't necessarily stand by the things that he says.\n\nRich: Okay. Let's go back to former President Trump. What if anything, do you dislike about him?\n\nSponsor Message\n\nCherlyn: I'm just trying to narrow it down. Just the turmoil he's put the country in all of his indictments, his shady practices.\n\nEugene: His tendency to lie when the truth will do. Say for example if someone plays a recording, a video recording or audio recording of him saying one thing. If he disagrees with it, he's like, it didn't happen. It's fake. Despite having action, been video recorded or audio recorded, having said the thing.\n\nBob: I think his utter disregard for the office of the presidency and what it stands for in the last 248 years that we've established. I also think that his policies towards our allies, in particular NATO and South Korea and Taiwan, putting us at a disadvantage with the rest of the world in our allies not knowing what we're going to do or what we're thinking.\n\nRich: So it looks like Biden's running against Trump again this November. And for this next question, I want you to assume that these are your only two choices, or that you could choose not to vote. So for a moment, let's imagine the election is tomorrow by a show of fingers. if these were your only two choices, who would not vote?\n\nAsa: I find it hard to believe that in the entire nation of millions and millions of people, that we are right back to the line of two people. I don't understand how we end up with just two people. We're right back to where we started.\n\nRich: So does sitting it out and not voting help one candidate over another? And if so, which candidate benefits more if you don't vote?\n\nAsa: Probably Trump.\n\nRich: He benefits more if you don\u2019t vote?\n\nAsa: I think so.\n\nRich: How so?\n\nAsa: Because if I had to vote, it might be probably for Biden because I think Donald Trump had his opportunity. I think there was a lot of people that believed in him that he could make some change and it just didn't happen. It just didn't happen.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nRich: So for the other five of you, given that binary choice, who would vote for Biden? Okay, Eugene, Bob, Nikaiya, Cherlyn. And Rob, you would take Trump. Okay, got it. So the four of you who would take Biden, tell me why you would take Biden.\n\nNikaiya: Well, he really didn't do much this time, but I would be willing to give him a second chance for a number of reasons. And at the top of my list, I definitely need my student loans wiped out, which was among one of the promises that was made.\n\nCherlyn: I hate the phrase, but it\u2019s the lesser of two evils.\n\nBob: I have much more confidence in Biden's ability to represent the country in foreign affairs. I think that from an integrity perspective, he is by far the better choice. Again, if we only have choice of those two, some of me is leaning towards what Cherlyn said, it's the lesser of two evils, but it's clearly night and day when we have one candidate who has been indicted and is facing felony charges and is a known liar and another one who has dedicated his life, albeit somewhat ineffective at times to the service of the country and in an honorable fashion.\n\nEugene: I'm actually a mix of Bob and Sherilyn in that because these are the only two choices I would definitely pick Biden over Trump and because Biden is more of a statesman, granted he's been in public service longer than I've been alive, but he's good at it. He's built relationships with world leaders and the kinds of world leaders that we want to have positive relationships with.\n\nRich: Rob, why would you take Trump?\n\nRob: The economy was better, immigration was better controlled. Biden passed the law [the 1994 crime bill] under Bill Clinton where Hillary Clinton came out and said these are super predators and that locked up minorities at a much higher rate than the general population. And Trump signed a law to reverse that, to let some of these people out early, primarily minority people. Also, when people talk about, oh, the conservative court, the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, Obama ran on that in 2008 and said he would make it law and he didn't do it and Biden was part of that ticket. They completely, they could have legalized it nationwide and they didn't do it even though they said they would.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nRich: Okay, so let me ask you this, Rob, just as just a speculative question. If Trump is convicted of a felony or multiple felonies in the New York trial, would that affect your willingness to vote for him at all?\n\nRob: No, because it'll be all overturned on appeal.\n\nRich: Got it. For all six of you, by a show of fingers, who wishes that neither Trump nor Biden were running this year, you had a different set of candidates to choose from? All six of you. Please listen carefully to this next question. By a show of fingers, for how many of you will this be a vote against the candidate you don't like more than a vote for the person you do? So all six of you. Alright, so I'll give you another scenario. Imagine the election is tomorrow and it's a five-way race between Joe Biden, Donald Trump, Robert Kennedy, Jr., Cornell West and Jill Stein.\n\nOr you could of course choose not to vote. So these are your options. So by the show of fingers in this group, who would take Biden in this five way scenario? Eugene, Bob and Sherilyn. Three of you. Who would take Trump? None of you. Who would take Kennedy? Rob.\n\nRich:. So Nikaya, you're not taking any of those five?\n\nNikaiya: I really don't know who I'll vote for. Biden would just be like, okay on a whim. But yeah, no, I really wouldn't know. Out of the five, not today.\n\nRich: So wait a second. So it's a two-way race. You're taking Biden over Trump. It's a five-way race. You stopped supporting Biden?\n\nNikaiya: Not necessarily stop, but I mean unless the other three give me a better reason to choose one of them.\n\nRich: Just give me a sense of it. Is it you would vote for in this five way choice, are you likely to not vote or are you likely to vote for Biden?\n\nNikaiya:I would be likely to vote for Biden.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nRich: So I'll change my Biden count from three to four. All right. And Asa you still wouldn't vote?\n\nAsa: You know what if the election was tomorrow and these three individuals just showed up? I would have to do cram time. I would find out as much as I could about those three. And if it was something that I didn't like that I would definitely go with Biden. But I think a change needs to happen between these two individuals. We cannot keep going down the same road anymore.\n\nRich: And Rob, you would go from Trump to Kennedy? Yep. Tell me about that decision.\n\nRob: I've seen numerous interviews of his, I've read bad pieces. He's put out, for example, he was against the Covid vaccine and people said, \u2018Oh, you're an anti-vaxxer.\u2019 He said, no, just this vaccine. I got chickenpox when I was a kid. The vaccine wasn't invented until 1995. It took him that long. The man who invented the mRNA vaccine said it's going to be leaky, so it means it's going to spread. We were told \u2018You can't work, you can't do this, you have to wear a mask.\u2019 And that all turned out to be lies. And he pointed that out and he took a lot of grief for it. But he has a line in between Trump and Biden where I see that he's a clear choice.\n\nRich: So by a show of fingers who would say you're paying close attention to the 2024 presidential campaign, who's paying close attention to it? Four of you all. Okay. So if you had to place a $50 bet on the outcome of the election, who would you say is going to win? Not who you want to win, but who you think realistically will win by a show of fingers. Who would say that you think Trump will win? Three of you. Who thinks Biden will win? The other three of you.\n\nRich: So by a show of fingers, without saying anything, who can name at least one thing President Biden has achieved while in office? Something that Biden himself would say is an achievement. I got one-Bob. Anybody else, name any achievements from Biden in his three plus years? I got Eugene as the second, the other four of you it seems are no, Okay.\n\nBob: Well, the one thing that comes to mind immediately is to champion the student loan forgiveness program.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nEugene: His infrastructure bill, getting the billions to fix America's crumbling and aged infrastructure.\n\nRich: If President Biden were to be reelected by a show of fingers and without saying anything, who can name something he has pledged to do in a second term? I'll take that as a No, none of you have anything you can remember he's pledged to do in a second term? Okay.\n\nRich: By a show of fingers who can name at least one thing former President Trump achieved while in office as in something that Trump himself would say is an achievement. I've got Rob, Bob, anybody else? Just two of you. Okay. Rob, what did he achieve?\n\nRob: Putting tariffs on Chinese goods so they couldn't undercut U.S. manufacturers. I don't know how successful it was, but he visited North Korea and everyone said, \u2018Oh, he is going to start World War III. He's going to start World War III.\u2019 And I go, why would he go and meet with this guy?\n\nBob: Those are the exact two things that I had in mind.\n\nRich: By a show of fingers, and again without saying anything, who can name something former President Trump has pledged to do in a second term? Three of you. What does he pledge to do?\n\nEugene: Be a dictator on day one.\n\nRich: Is there anything policy-wise you can remember him pledging to do?\n\nEugene: He talked about securing the border.\n\nBob: He indicated that he would have no qualms about firing folks in the Department of Justice if they didn't prosecute who he wanted them to. And thus making the DOJ more under the executive branch and to their whims rather than being independent.\n\nRob: Restricting immigration, putting a hundred percent tariff on Chinese electric vehicles that are manufactured in Mexico as they try to get around the tariff.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nRich: I'd like you all to stop and think for a moment about this next question. I'm going to call on you again one at a time. What is the top issue in the news these days that concerns you the most?\n\nNikaiya: I have a few actually. I'm really concerned about the opioid epidemic.\n\nRob: The southern border.\n\nAsa: The security of America, the borders. And not only Mexico, but I think Canada has its challenges too. I think it's a little bit harder to come across the border in Canada, but just securing the country.\n\nCherlyn: What grabs my attention is housing prices. I'm fortunate that I'm of an age and time in my life where it's not a concern, but I think for many young Americans, housing is a real issue.\n\nEugene: Inflation.\n\nBob: Future of our democracy.\n\nRich: I have a follow on question to that. So first sort of a concise answer to this one, what do you consider the biggest threat to your long-term future? Let's say like 20 years from now.\n\nAsa: I\u2019m 62. So Social Security, that's my biggest concern right now. My wife keeps telling me I got to work till 72, only if she joins me. But social security and where that's going to go and where it's going today and looking out for all of us that have paid in so much money into it and hopefully getting something out of it to help us live a quality of life.\n\nRob: Government spending and inflation.\n\nCherlyn: I was going to say inflation as well. As secure as I feel right now, it\u2019s that uncertainty in the future, what inflation's going to bring and how that could shake things up.\n\nBob: The economy, inflation and the stability overal of the economy.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nEugene: The ongoing stability of the United States as a concept.\n\nNikaiya: I would definitely say Social Security.\n\nRich: So by a show of fingers who thinks the US economy right now is in lousy shape, show of fingers could say the US economy right now is in lousy shape. Asa Rob, anybody else? Nikaya. Three of you. So the unemployment rate is near a 50 year low at 3.5%. Inflation, which was surging a couple years ago, has receded. The stock market is flirting with all time highs. Economists who look at the economy now think it is in stellar shape. In other words, what do you see that they don't see?\n\nNikaiya: Well, I live in a big city and the cost of living is outrageous. Everywhere you turn around is all these luxury apartment buildings being built. The state minimum wage is still probably the lowest out there in Pennsylvania. So I mean it is like people aren't going to know what to do and I believe it's going to keep people impoverished and struggling to keep a roof over their head.\n\nAsa: The continuing rising of prices of everything, especially groceries. I'm grateful that my kids are moving out and going to college because I'm a restaurant manager and sometimes I say it's cheaper to eat in a restaurant than it is to go shopping. Everything just seems to be going up, haircuts are going up. The barber that I go to has had his scissors for the last 25 years, but yet the prices just keep going up and up and up. It just seems like, yeah, where's all this money going?\n\nRob: Just like they both said, the cost of living. We rent right now, we're looking to buy, but the rent just keeps going up and up. And I go, how did you improve my living situation? The cost of groceries and the fact that the government just seems to give money to some people who come here undocumented, but we have homeless people by the millions in this country.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nRich: Do you feel like your finances are in better condition, worse condition than four years ago? Or are they the same? Who would say that they're better now than they were four years ago? Four of you. Who would say they're worse? One. Asa, You'd say the same?\n\nAsa: Same.\n\nRich: I'd like to know who you think would do a better job managing the economy over the next four years. Trump or Biden? How many of you would say by a show of fingers that Trump would do a better job managing the economy over the next four years? Two of you, Cheryl and Rob. Who thinks that Biden would? Three of you.\n\nNikaiya:I guess somewhere in the middle. When Trump was president, he did try to get the ball rolling with the stimulus payments.\n\nRich: Okay, so two of you think that Trump would do a better job handling the economy over the next four years. Cheryl, why do you think Trump would do a better job?\n\nCherlyn: As much as I don't like him, I do think he has a lot of good fiscal policy and I just haven't been crazy about Biden's willingness to spend. So that's why I'd say Trump.\n\nRob: Pretty much the same. Where apparently we can send billions to Ukraine and to me that's a European war and Europe should be supporting them, not so much the United States. And we can send billions to Israel, but we can't turn around and spend that money with jobs, programs, housing for the homeless here.\n\nRich: Okay, Eugene, why would Biden do a better job on the economy?\n\nEugene: I believe he focuses more on the domestic programs that do need attention. And I reference again, the infrastructure issues that he's trying to get tackled. And then he's also promoting chip manufacturing in the United States as well as electric vehicles built in the United States. So he's also promoting American industry.\n\nRich: Bob, why is Biden better on the economy?\n\nBob: Again, I kind of agree with Eugene. What he's done so far for the economy has been positive. It is difficult to compare Trump and Biden because the Covid years were something that was just off the charts with a one off sort of thing. But his infrastructure policies, his investment in businesses, his union policies, but the thing that we've got to remember is Trump, Biden or anybody else, they can only do so much as president. It's really up to Congress. So you can have the best policies, the best intentions, but if Congress doesn't play along, nothing happens or only part of that happens.\n\nAsa: I have to second with what Eugene and Bob just said as well. It is about industry and about supporting the infrastructure of America and just build again, buy again from the United States. I think that's what he's been doing. That's what he's been trying for.\n\nRich: Okay, so who in this group is concerned about the current situation at America's southern border? All six of you.\n\nEugene: We're on the verge of a humanitarian crisis and there seems to be no clear solution to get it resolved. And then there's been talk of taking all the people who have crossed the border who are not currently awaiting asylum trials or what have you, and quote unquote sending them back where they came from. But there's no way you can humanely uproot 11 plus million people from wherever the hell it is.\n\nRob: The free flowing, that when Trump was president there was Rule 42, it said stay in Mexico and then apply for asylum and Biden came in and got rid of it. And also we had this flood of humanity come in and Mexico doesn't want them going through Mexico. But the government there is corrupt in enough of the states that people are sending people over illegally from China to come into the U.S. through the southern border. That's where the fentanyl comes from.\n\nBob: The lack of enforcement of the federal laws for immigration. Again, it goes back to the border seems to be relatively open, the southern border, and we have laws as Texas is trying to implement, Arizona is trying to implement state laws to make it illegal to cross, but that runs against the federal laws.So if we have it on the book, let's enforce it.\n\nRich: So who's most to blame for these concerns?\n\nCherlyn: I cannot put that on one party. I would say our political leaders as a whole, it's been something they've all neglected and that's how I think we've gotten into this.\n\nNikaiya: Yeah, I can't even really say Trump, so I would have to say Biden.\n\nRich: Okay. And why Biden?\n\nNikaiya: At least Trump tried. He tried to regulate it. I mean, he might not have went about it the right way or his approach to it, but it could have been better regulated by Trump\n\nRich: Who\u2019s to blame for the situation we\u2019re in right now?\n\nRob: The Democratic party and businesses that want to drive down people's wages by having people from other companies or countries coming in here and working for less money than Americans. It's also known as the great replacement theory in terms of who will vote for the Democratic Party.\n\nRich: Anybody else to blame for the situation we're in right now with immigration?\n\nBob: The political establishments that have been in place for decades and decades, all parties, every two years, immigration is an issue. Every four years immigration is an issue. And you look back at Republicans, you look back at Democrats, they've all said they're going to try to fix it. It still is the worst it\u2019s ever been. And it's a political time bomb because when you start making legislation to restrict people, then you lose voters.\n\nRich: By a show of fingers, for how many of you will abortion be a big factor in who you'll vote for in November's presidential election? Three of you.\n\nNikaiya: Because I have a young daughter and I am a grandmother, a little girl, and who knows? God knows what might happen. And I don't want them to feel ostracized because they don't want to have a baby. It should be their choice.\n\nCherlyn: I don't have daughters. I have sons, but I don't want women younger than me having less rights and freedom than what I've had.\n\nRich: And just to make sure I know where each of you stands on this, who in this group considers yourself pro-choice? Five of you. Asa you also. All six of you.\n\nRich: I want to call on each of you to give me a word or phrase to describe the current state of American democracy.\n\nNikaiya: Weak.\n\nCherlyn: Concerning.\n\nBob: Chaotic and at risk.\n\nEugene: Crumbling.\n\nRob: Dysfunctional.\n\nAsa: Non-caring.\n\nRich: By a show of fingers, who thinks that the U.S. does more bad than good in the world? Who thinks the US does more bad than good in the world? One of you. How so Rob?\n\nRob: We constantly feel that we have to go into countries and we're in Syria. We're still in Syria because why? I don't know, because of oil. Why do we go to Iraq? Oil? Why do we go to Afghanistan? The Taliban is still there.And what is, it's 20 years of spending all that money killing millions of people in the Middle East. How did that benefit today? It didn't at all.\n\nRich: And by a show of fingers, for whom in this group will the Israel Hamas War and the situation in Gaza be an issue that will affect how you vote in November? None of you. So for none of you, this is an actual voting issue? Okay. Got it. Alright.",

        "text": "Three ways Mexico\u2019s new president could transform Central America\nMexico\u2019s northern border with the United States has received a lot of attention, but its southern border\u2014and, more broadly, its relations with Central American countries\u2014deserves attention, too. For many years, the thinking went that Mexico was, in a way, Central America\u2019s big brother. Dare we ask if the ascent of Claudia Sheinbaum, who on Sunday was elected as Mexico\u2019s next president, will make her country Central America\u2019s big sister? While she will likely focus mostly on domestic issues\u2014including tackling the rising levels of violence and insecurity in the country\u2014she also has an opportunity to positively reset ties with Mexico\u2019s southern neighbors. Three areas to watch in this respect are climate change, nearshoring, and migration.\n\nA former mayor of Mexico City, Sheinbaum has a strong foundation in addressing urban challenges, governance, and social policies. Like her predecessor, outgoing President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, Sheinbaum will likely coordinate her policies under a narrative of addressing social injustice and advocating for Mexico\u2019s most vulnerable. But unlike her predecessor, Sheinbaum is an environmental engineer and climate scientist by training. She appears poised to place environmental issues, including climate-change mitigation and adaptation, high among her social justice concerns. This would likely include seeking to advance issues ranging from sustainable agriculture to renewable energy.\n\nAt first glance, this may sound odd. Mexico is a major oil producer\u2014the second largest exporter in Latin America after Brazil\u2014and Sheinbaum has all but guaranteed that she will continue funding the state-owned oil company PEMEX, which suffers from a range of inefficiencies and carries debt of more than one hundred billion dollars. However, her scientific background and previous initiatives indicate a potential for balancing economic development with environmental sustainability. For example, during her time as mayor of Mexico City, Sheinbaum spearheaded the installment of solar power panels on top of a major market. Furthermore, she campaigned for president on a promise to address, early on in her administration, the water issues affecting Mexico City. Already during her first speech since the election, and probably in an effort to differentiate herself from L\u00f3pez Obrador, Sheinbaum spoke about an upcoming renewable energy program for Mexico. Calibrating this balance will be crucial, as will working with regional partners. After all, Mexico and its neighbor Guatemala, for instance, face similar challenges of environmental degradation and the impacts of climate change, from flooding to droughts and a lack of access to water.\n\nAnother way in which Sheinbaum could partner with her Central American neighbors is by working together to seize nearshoring opportunities. Specifically, she and her regional counterparts could promote a mechanism whereby Central American economies would be able to join the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). Nearshoring, or bringing international supply chains and production closer to the US market, can provide significant economic benefits, creating jobs and fostering economic stability in Mexico and throughout Central America. Promoting economic integration through the USMCA could provide a structured framework for this cooperation. The idea has been floated for a couple of years now, first by Costa Rica in 2022. This move would enhance the competitive edge of Central American economies, which in many ways are too small to make a difference on their own but together could create economies of scale. Bringing other Central American countries into the USMCA would allow these nations to benefit from the same trade advantages enjoyed by Mexico. It could also reduce many of the economic pressures that drive migration, namely a lack of jobs and insufficient wages.\n\nFurthermore, Sheinbaum\u2019s administration could adopt a more humanitarian approach to migration, focusing on protecting migrant rights and providing humanitarian assistance. While L\u00f3pez Obrador touted his tree-planting \u201cSembrando Vida\u201d program, Sheinbaum could take the programs a step further. This approach aligns with her broader progressive values\u2014she is a self-described humanist\u2014and can enhance Mexico\u2019s role as a regional leader in addressing the migration crisis. During the campaign, Sheinbaum repeatedly mentioned increased investments in social and youth programs in Central America, which, if designed holistically and sustainably, could effectively curb migration from Mexico\u2019s neighbors. This is particularly important now, as US President Joe Biden prepares to roll out an executive order that would allow the United States to temporarily close its southern border if a threshold of encounters with migrants at the border is reached\u2014reportedly, an average of five thousand crossings in a week or 2,500 in a day.\n\nRegional security is another area in which Sheinbaum could make a big difference. Almost three dozen candidates were assassinated during the current electoral campaign, and record-breaking violence in the country is resulting in more than thirty thousand homicides each year. Improved and increased intelligence-sharing between Mexico and Central American countries can help combat organized crime and violence, which are significant push factors for migration. This is also an area in which the United States and Mexico may look to double down on their cooperation. Sheinbaum has pledged to address the rampant impunity in Mexico\u2014less than five percent of criminal investigations are solved and many crimes go unreported. While Sheinbaum is unlikely to approach the security issue in the severe manner of President Nayib Bukele in El Salvador, she has recognized the urgency of this issue for the livelihood of millions of Mexicans.\n\nSheinbaum\u2019s presidency could bring about significant positive change in Mexico and its relations with Central America. Her administration\u2019s policies on energy and environmental sustainability, economic integration, and migration will have an important impact on the future of the region. The first female president of Mexico has the opportunity to redefine her country\u2019s role in Central America, address the root causes of migration, and promote a more stable and prosperous region. In this new chapter for Mexico and the region, the Aztec nation could very well be a strong and stable partner for Central American nations.\n\nMar\u00eda Fernanda Bozmoski is deputy director, operations and finance at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center, where she leads the center\u2019s work on Mexico and Central America.\n\nFurther reading\n\nImage: April 15, 2024, Mexico City, Mexico: The presidential candidate for the Juntos Hagamos Historia coalition, Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo speaks during the Meeting with Companies and Entrepreneurs at the Hilton Hotel.",

Will Donald Trump be allowed to contest the 2024 US Presidential Election if he is convicted ? This question will not only decide the politics of the country, it will also affect the world in a big way and so many people across the globe have kept an eye on it.Though the former US president has denied all charges, he faces a fine of up to $5,000 and up to four years in prison for each of the 34 felony counts he faces, legal experts have said that he is most unlikely to get jail sentence. So, what will happen if the GOP contender is found guilty, but he is not sent to jail?According to the ' Metro ', the US Constitution has a clear provision that any one can contest presidential election if he is at least 35 years old, a \u2018natural born citizen\u2019 and has lived in the US for at least 14 years. It has no restrictions around a criminal record. It means that Donald Trump can contest presidential election even if he is found guilty.But states have different positions on this issue. Some US states bar people with a felony conviction from pursing state or local office, though there is no such restriction at the federal level.According to the Florida Division of Elections website, a Florida resident with a felony conviction in another state is ineligible to vote in Florida \u201cif the conviction would make the person ineligible to vote in the state where the person was convicted.\u201d Trump has been a Florida resident since 2019. On the other hand, convicted felons in New York will only lose their voting rights while incarcerated. Keeping this in mind, it cane be said safely that if Trump were convicted in New York and unable to vote there, he would not be able to vote in Florida. But he can vote in New York if he is not sent to jail there.Besides, if Donald Trump is convicted and sentenced with a jail term, he can appeal the decision and ask for any potential prison sentence to be delayed during appeal.The US Constitution has a clear provision that any one can contest presidential election if he is at least 35 years old, a \u2018natural born citizen\u2019 and has lived in the US for at least 14 years.

        "text": "Muslim drift to Republican Party stalls amid Gaza conflict\nThe war in Gaza is shaking Muslim Americans\u2019 political loyalties ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November.\n\nDisenchanted by President Joe Biden\u2019s embrace of Israel, many Democratic-leaning Muslims who once backed him are now vowing to withdraw their endorsement.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just Muslim Democrats abandoning their once-preferred candidate. Some Muslim Republicans are also wavering amidst their own party's support of Israel.\n\nMo Nehad, a Pakistani American Republican activist in Fort Bend County, Texas, has seen up close the political effects of the Gaza conflict on Muslim American voting.\n\nIn late 2020, Nehad, who is a small-business owner, police officer and military warrant officer, helped found a grassroots group in a bid to engage the local Muslim community with the Republican Party.\n\nInitially focused on opposition to COVID-19 vaccine mandates and mask mandates, the group, called Muslim Americans of Texas, soon found a new cause: a conservative backlash to sex and gender education policies in local schools.\n\n\"We were essentially trying to tell the Muslim community, regardless of what has happened in the past overseas, let's focus on national topics and events,\" Nehad said in an interview. \u201cAnd when you compare what traditionally a Democratic-elected president has done and a Republican-elected president has done [on national issues], a Republican-elected president is much better for the Muslims.\u201d\n\nThe advocacy paid off, he said. While the Fort Bend County Muslim community remained solidly Democratic, a small number started crossing party lines, mirroring a pattern seen across the country.\n\n\"These are people who go to the same masjid as I do, people who are in the same home-school groups,\" he said.\n\nThen the war in Gaza broke out after the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, testing the political allegiance of Muslim Democrats and Republicans alike, with both viewing their parties as equally pro-Israel.\n\nMany Muslim Americans who had overwhelmingly voted for Biden in 2020 fumed over the president\u2019s support for an Israeli military campaign that has killed more than 30,000 Palestinians.\n\nEarlier this year, a group of progressive Muslim activists launched a campaign they labeled #AbandonBiden, inducing hundreds of thousands of voters to vote \u201cuncommitted\u201d in key Democratic primaries in Michigan and elsewhere. Members were also threatening not to vote for Biden in November.\n\nRepublican-leaning Muslims, fewer in number, have not been as vocal. While many are backing their party, its equally staunch support of Israel has alienated some, according to Muslim activists and experts.\n\nNehad said that while he intends to vote for former President Donald Trump in November, some Republican Muslims are reconsidering their stance and even \u201cgoing back\u201d to the Democratic Party, drawn by that party\u2019s stronger criticism of Israeli actions.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want to vote for Republican candidates because the Republican candidates do not want to go ahead and openly denounce what Israel is doing,\u201d Nehad said.\n\nDrift to GOP stalls\n\nYoussef Chouhoud, a political science professor at Christopher Newport University in Newport News, Virginia, said the war in Gaza appears to have paused if not blunted the recent Muslim drift to the GOP.\n\nHad the war not occurred, he said that as many as 40% of Muslim Americans would have voted for the Republican presidential nominee in November.\n\n\u201cI was fully expecting that,\u201d Chouhoud, who studies Muslim American voting behavior, said.\n\nNow, he said he is not so sure.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if upwards of 40% are voting third party or otherwise testing some vote that is not a two-party vote,\u201d he said.\n\nA recent poll by the Arab American Anti-Discrimination Committee and The Truth Project showed that only 7% of Arab American voters plan to vote for Biden and 2% for Trump, with Green Party candidate Jill Stein receiving 25%.\n\nHow the Muslim vote will influence the outcome of the presidential contest between Biden and Trump remains uncertain.\n\nNumbering about 3.5 million, Muslims make up just 1% of the U.S. population. In tight races in swing states with large Muslim populations, though, their vote could potentially sway the outcome of the election.\n\nBut American Muslims are a diverse lot, with interests and priorities often as varied as the general electorate. While anger over the Gaza conflict may have unified the community, it is not the only issue driving their voting decision, said Saher Selod, director of research for the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding, a Muslim American research group in Dearborn, Michigan.\n\n\u201cWe need to know if [some Muslim voters] are centering this issue as a major driving force in terms of how they're going to vote,\" Selod said in an interview. \"Other groups, while they might support a cease-fire, have other issues that that they're going to vote on.\"\n\nVOA asked both the Biden and Trump campaigns about their outreach to Muslim Americans and any steps to assuage their concerns over the Gaza war.\n\nIn a statement, a Biden campaign spokesperson said, \u201cThe President shares the goal of a just and lasting peace in the region. He\u2019s working tirelessly to that end.\u201d\n\nIn a separate statement, the campaign\u2019s Michigan director said the Biden team is in contact with Arab American and Muslim groups in Detroit and Dearborn. Both cities have large Muslim populations.\n\nThe Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment. The campaign has not publicly reached out to the Muslim community on the war in Gaza, but Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Michael Boulos, and a former Trump administration official recently met with a group of Arab Americans and Middle Eastern leaders in Michigan.\n\nHistorical patterns\n\nHistorically, Muslim American voters have oscillated between the two major political parties. Socially conservative, most voted Republican in the 1980s and 1990s, leading some party activists to hail them as \u201cnatural\u201d allies. In 2000, a majority backed Republican George W. Bush.\n\nThat changed after the attacks of Sept. 11, as the Bush administration\u2019s increased scrutiny of the community amid its \u201cwar on terror\u201d sent Muslims flocking to the Democratic Party. In every presidential election since 2004, Muslims have favored the Democratic nominee.\n\nBut with memories of 9/11 fading in recent years, some Muslims began to shift back to the Republican Party, driven by shared conservative values such as opposition to abortion, gay marriage and LGBTQ-inclusive policies in schools.\n\n\"This is the social conservatism within this community kind of creeping up to the surface and guiding political decisions in light of a lot of marquee policy debates,\" Chouhoud said.\n\nSome polls confirm this recent voting trend.\n\nIn October 2020, an Institute for Social Policy and Understanding poll found 30% of Muslims approved of Trump's job performance, up from 13% in 2018.\n\nIn November 2020, an Associated Press exit poll found that 64% supported Biden and 35% backed Trump.\n\nOther polls showed a more modest increase in Muslim support for Trump.\n\nMuslim support for Republican candidates continued into 2022. During that year's midterm elections, 28% of Muslims voted Republican, up from 17% during the 2018 midterms, while 70% voted Democratic, down from 81%.\n\nToday, the Muslim voter base is firmly rooted in the Democratic Party, though a significant slice leans Republican.\n\nA recent Pew Research poll found that 66% of Muslim voters are Democrats or lean Democratic, while 32% are Republicans or lean Republican.\n\nThree previous polls conducted by Pew had all shown lower-level numbers of Republican or Republican-leaning Muslim voters, according to Besheer Mohamed, a senior Pew researcher.\n\n\u201cThere are certain issues where Muslims tend to align more with the Republican Party, Mohamed said, noting positive views of religion and skepticisms toward LGBTQ issues. \u201cThen there are other issues where that\u2019s not the case.\u201d\n\nNehad, once an independent voter, is now a Republican. His political pivot came after he ran unsuccessfully as a Democratic candidate for constable where he said he felt pressured to champion policies that clashed with his religious convictions.\n\nThis year, he stood as a Republican candidate for Fort Bend County sheriff.\n\n\u201cEverything the Republican Party stands for, 70% of it aligns with my beliefs and values,\u201d Nehad said, in a drawl honed over more than 25 years of living in the Lone Star state. \u201cBut when I compare the same with the Democratic Party, it\u2019s only maybe 20 or 40%, if that.\u201d\n\nZahoor Gire, another co-founder of the Muslim Americans of Texas, said Muslim Americans \u201cshare conservative Republican values\u201d such as strong families, traditional marriage, traditional gender roles and opposition to abortion.\n\n\u201cI had family members of my own that had voted Democratic before and are now voting Republican,\u201d Gire said.\n\nUnderscoring the renewed Muslim embrace of the Republican Party, he said a record eight Republican Muslim candidates have run for office in Texas this year.\n\n\u201cSo that shows you the willingness of people to embrace this party and then run for office through this party\u2019s platform,\u201d Gire said.\n\nTo many Muslim Republicans, Trump is not the anti-Muslim politician as he is seen by others. They\u2019ve defended his so-called \u201cMuslim ban\u201d as a necessary national security measure rather than a religiously motivated injunction.\n\nBut the Gaza war has become \u201cthe main issue\u201d for Muslims in America, Gire said. And with Trump urging Israel earlier this year to \u201cfinish what they started,\u201d his perceived support of Israel at the expense of Palestinians is giving some Muslim Republicans pause.\n\nAsked if he will support Trump in November, Gire said, \"We need to see very specifically what his foreign policies will be, what his stance towards Muslim Americans will be.\u201d",

We\u2019ve all made it, with our heroines who gave us our homeland, with our mothers, our daughters and our granddaughters.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have demonstrated that Mexico is a democratic country with peaceful elections,\u201d she said.\n\nThe National Electoral Institute\u2019s president said Ms. Sheinbaum had between 58.3% and 60.7% of the vote, according to a statistical sample. Opposition candidate X\u00f3chitl G\u00e1lvez had between 26.6% and 28.6% of the vote and Jorge \u00c1lvarez M\u00e1ynez had between 9.9% and 10.8% of the vote.\n\nThe preliminary count, which started off very slowly, put Ms. Sheinbaum 27 points ahead of Ms. G\u00e1lvez with 42% of polling place tallies counted shortly after her victory speech.\n\nThe governing party candidate campaigned on continuing the political course set over the last six years by her political mentor President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador.\n\nHis anointed successor, the 61-year-old Ms. Sheinbaum led the campaign wire-to-wire despite a spirited challenge from G\u00e1lvez. This was the first time in Mexico that the two main opponents were women.\n\nShortly before electoral authorities' announcement, Ms. G\u00e1lvez wrote on the social platform X, \u201cThe votes are there. Don\u2019t let them hide them.\u201d\n\nMs. Sheinbaum is unlikely to enjoy the kind of unquestioning devotion that L\u00f3pez Obrador has enjoyed. Both belong to the governing Morena party.\n\nIn Mexico City\u2019s main colonial-era main plaza, the Zocalo, Ms. Sheinbaum\u2019s lead did not initially draw the kind of cheering, jubilant crowds that greeted L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s victory in 2018.",

        "text": "What Europe Fears\nIn early April, a crowd of diplomats and dignitaries gathered in the Flemish countryside to toast the most powerful military alliance in the history of the world, and convince themselves it wasn\u2019t about to collapse.\n\nThey arrived in a convoy of town cars that snaked down a private driveway and deposited them outside Truman Hall, a white-brick house set on 27 acres of gardens and hazelnut groves. Originally built by a Belgian chocolatier, the estate was sold to the American government at a discount\u2014a thank-you gift for liberating Europe\u2014and became the residence of the U.S. ambassador to NATO. Tonight, Julianne Smith, the inexhaustibly cheerful diplomat who currently holds the job, was stationed at the front door, greeting each guest.\n\nThe reception was part of a two-day onslaught of ceremonial activity ostensibly organized to celebrate the 75th anniversary of NATO. There were photo ops and triumphant speeches. The original copy of NATO\u2019s founding charter was brought from Washington, D.C., for display, left open to the most important lines in the treaty, Article 5: \u201cThe Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all \u2026\u201d Officials ate cake, and declared the alliance stronger than ever.\n\nAt Truman Hall, every effort was made to keep the mood festive despite a storm looming outside. Beneath a backyard tent, Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke, followed by NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg.\n\nJens Stoltenberg (Illustration by The Atlantic. Source: Omar Havana / Getty.)\n\nStoltenberg, lean and unrumpled, decided to do something diplomatically unorthodox: acknowledge reality. Anxiety about America\u2019s commitment to the alliance had been omnipresent and unspoken; now Stoltenberg was directly addressing the dangers of a potential U.S. withdrawal from the world.\n\n\u201cThe United States left Europe after the First World War,\u201d he said, adding, with a measure of Scandinavian understatement, \u201cThat was not a big success.\u201d\n\nThe wind was picking up outside, pounding the flaps of the tent and making it difficult to hear. Stoltenberg raised his voice. \u201cEver since the alliance was established,\u201d he said, \u201cit has been a great success, preserving peace, preventing war, and enabling economic prosperity\u2014\u201d\n\nA strong gust hit the tent, rattling the light trusses above. Guests glanced around nervously.\n\nStoltenberg stumbled. \u201cThe great success has been, uh, enabled or has happened not least because of U.S. leadership\u2014\u201d\n\nAnother gust, and the large chandelier hanging over the crowd began to swing. Murmurs rippled through the audience. Stoltenberg, perhaps aware of the unfortunate symbolism that would result from a NATO tent collapse, got quickly to the point.\n\n\u201cI cannot tell you exactly what the next crisis or the next conflict or the next war will be,\u201d he said, but \u201cas long as we stand together, no one can threaten us. We are safe.\u201d\n\nStoltenberg would tell me weeks later that the speech was intended as a rallying cry. That night, it sounded more like a plea.\n\nThe undercurrent of dread at Truman Hall was not unique. I encountered it in nearly every conversation I had while traveling through Europe this spring. In capitals across the continent\u2014from Brussels to Berlin, Warsaw to Tallinn\u2014leaders and diplomats expressed a sense of alarm bordering on panic at the prospect of Donald Trump\u2019s reelection.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a very precarious place,\u201d one senior NATO official told me. He wasn\u2019t supposed to talk about such things on the record, but it was hardly a secret. The largest armed conflict in Europe since World War II was grinding into its third year. The Ukrainian counteroffensive had failed, and Russia was gaining momentum. Sixty billion dollars in desperately needed military aid for Ukraine had been stalled for months in the dysfunctional U.S. Congress. And, perhaps most ominous, America\u2014the country with by far the biggest military in NATO\u2014appeared on the verge of reelecting a president who has repeatedly threatened to withdraw the U.S. from the alliance.\n\nFear of losing Europe\u2019s most powerful ally has translated into a pathologically intense fixation on the U.S. presidential race. European officials can explain the Electoral College in granular detail and cite polling data from battleground states. Thomas Bagger, the state secretary in the German foreign ministry, told me that in a year when billions of people in dozens of countries around the world will get the chance to vote, \u201cthe only election all Europeans are interested in is the American election.\u201d Almost every official I spoke with believed that Trump is going to win.\n\nIllustration by Chantal Jahchan. Sources: Andrew Caballero-Reynolds / AFP / Getty; Oliver F. Atkins / Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum.\n\nThe irony of Europe\u2019s obsession with the upcoming election is that the people who will decide its outcome aren\u2019t thinking about Europe much at all. In part, that\u2019s because many Americans haven\u2019t seen the need for NATO in their lifetime (despite the fact that the September 11 terrorist attacks were the only time Article 5 has been invoked). As one journalist in Brussels put it to me, the alliance has for decades been a \u201csolution in search of a problem.\u201d Now, with Russia waging war dangerously close to NATO territory, there\u2019s a large problem. Throughout my conversations, one word came up again and again when I asked European officials about the stakes of the American election: existential.\n\n\u201cThe anxiety is massive,\u201d Victoria Nuland, who served until recently as undersecretary for political affairs at the State Department, told me. Like other diplomats in the Biden administration, she has spent the three-plus years since Trump unwillingly left office working to restabilize America\u2019s relationship with its allies.\n\n\u201cForeign counterparts would say it to me straight up,\u201d Nuland recalled. \u201c\u2018The first Trump election\u2014maybe people didn\u2019t understand who he was, or it was an accident. A second election of Trump? We\u2019ll never trust you again.\u2019\u201d\n\nBERLIN, GERMANY\n\nTo understand why European governments are so worried about Trump\u2019s return, you could study his erratic behavior at international summits, his fraught relationship with Ukraine\u2019s president and open admiration for Russia\u2019s, his general aversion to the liberal international order. Or you could look at the exceedingly irregular tenure of Trump\u2019s ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell.\n\nFour years after he left Berlin, people in the city\u2019s political class still speak of Grenell as if they\u2019re processing some unresolved trauma. The mere mention of his name elicits heavy sighs and mirthless chuckles and brief, frozen stares into the middle distance. For them, Grenell\u2019s ambassadorship remains a bitter reminder of what working with the Trump administration was like\u2014and what Trump\u2019s return would mean.\n\nOften, people will tell you about the parties.\n\nHosting social functions is part of an ambassador\u2019s job. But the parties Grenell threw were more eclectic than a typical embassy reception. The guest lists were light on German political elites\u2014many of whom Grenell made a sport of publicly tormenting\u2014and featured instead a mix of far-right politicians, semi-canceled intellectuals, devout Christians, gay Trump fans, and sundry other friends and hangers-on. Standard social etiquette was at times disregarded; so was good taste. When Grenell hosted a superhero-themed Halloween party at the ambassador\u2019s residence in 2019, one male guest came dressed in a burka, while another wore a \u201csuicide bomber\u201d costume. Photos from the party circulated privately among mystified German journalists. \u201cIt was a freak show,\u201d recalled one Berlin-based reporter who saw the pictures and who, like others I spoke with, requested anonymity to speak candidly about the former ambassador. (Grenell declined my request for an interview.)\n\nThe scandalized reaction to Grenell\u2019s parties was emblematic of his broader reception in Berlin. A right-wing foreign-policy pundit and Twitter troll\u2014he once posted that Rachel Maddow should \u201ctake a breath and put on a necklace\u201d and talked about Michelle Obama \u201csweating on the East Room\u2019s carpet\u201d\u2014he arrived in Germany in May 2018 at a moment of growing geopolitical anxiety. Despite efforts by German Chancellor Angela Merkel to develop a normal working relationship with Trump, the new president seemed intent on antagonizing Europe\u2014hitting allies with tariffs, abruptly withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal, and constantly questioning the need for NATO. Another ambassador might have seen it as his job to ease tensions. But Grenell was not just any ambassador.\n\nHe was belligerent and uncouth, less a diplomat than a partisan operative. He was \u201ca special animal,\u201d Wolfgang Ischinger, a former German ambassador to the U.S., told me. \u201cHe did not play by the rules.\u201d\n\nHours after starting the job, Grenell tweeted a terse warning that \u201cGerman companies doing business in Iran should wind down operations immediately.\u201d A few weeks later, he invited a Breitbart News reporter to his residence and said he planned to use his position to \u201cempower other conservatives throughout Europe\u201d\u2014a comment widely interpreted as a political endorsement of European far-right parties, and one he later had to walk back.\n\nRichard Grenell (Illustration by The Atlantic. Source: Bernd von Jutrczenka / Picture Alliance / Getty.)\n\nGrenell wasn\u2019t any more tactful in private. In his first meeting with the German foreign ministry, according to a former diplomatic official in Berlin who was briefed on the encounter, Grenell announced, \u201cI\u2019m here to implement the American president\u2019s interests.\u201d The officials, taken aback by his audacity, tried politely to correct him: No, he was there to lobby for America\u2019s interests. But Grenell didn\u2019t seem to see the difference.\n\nHe hung a giant oil painting of Trump in the entryway of the ambassador\u2019s residence, and made a party trick out of flaunting his access to the White House. He would call the Oval Office \u201cfor fun\u201d just to show that \u201che had a direct line to the U.S. president,\u201d recalled Julian Reichelt, a friend of Grenell\u2019s who was then the editor of the right-leaning German tabloid Bild.\n\nAs Trump escalated his crusade against the European political establishment\u2014publicly rooting for Merkel\u2019s right-wing opponents and identifying the European Union as a \u201cfoe\u201d\u2014Grenell seemed eager to join in. After the president hijacked a NATO summit in July 2018 to deliver a tirade against countries that weren\u2019t spending enough on defense, Grenell did his best to replicate the performance in Berlin.\n\nThe ambassador quickly became a villain in the German press. The magazine Der Spiegel nicknamed him \u201cLittle Trump.\u201d German politicians publicly called on the U.S. to recall Grenell. One member of the Bundestag compared him to a \u201cfar-right colonial officer\u201d; another was quoted as saying that he acted like \u201cthe representative of a hostile power.\u201d\n\nSome observers would later speculate that the bad press was the product of a leak campaign by Merkel\u2019s government to isolate Grenell. Others believed that he deliberately courted outrage. \u201cHe didn\u2019t care a bit about his reputation here,\u201d Christoph Heusgen, the chair of the Munich Security Conference, told me. \u201cHe cared about offending the Germans and making headlines because he knew his boss would love that.\u201d Soon enough, the president was referring to Grenell as \u201cmy beautiful Ric\u201d and reportedly telling advisers that his man in Berlin \u201cgets it.\u201d\n\nGrenell\u2019s defenders would later argue that his hardball tactics got results. Take, for example, his vociferous opposition to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. The U.S. had long objected to its construction, which would dramatically increase Germany\u2019s reliance on Russian energy. But Grenell pressed the issue much harder than his predecessors had\u2014sending letters threatening sanctions against companies that worked on the project, and successfully lobbying Berlin to import American liquefied natural gas. After Russia invaded Ukraine, German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier admitted that clinging to Nord Stream 2 had been a \u201cmistake.\u201d\n\nTo Grenell\u2019s admirers, it was his effectiveness that made him unpopular in Berlin. \u201cThe ideal U.S. ambassador for your average German government,\u201d Reichelt told me, \u201cjust talks nicely about, like, the American dream and transatlantic relations and blah blah and freedom blah blah and what we can learn from each other.\u201d Grenell refused to be a mascot. \u201cHe was doing politics\u2014he was actually driving policies,\u201d Reichelt said. (Reichelt was fired from Bild in 2021 after The New York Times reported on a sexual relationship he\u2019d had with a subordinate; Reichelt denied abusing his authority.)\n\nBut by the time Grenell left Berlin, the mutual disdain between the ambassador and the political class was so thick that some wondered if he\u2019d kept an enemies list. Grenell, who briefly served as Trump\u2019s acting director of national intelligence, is reportedly on the shortlist for secretary of state or national security adviser in a second Trump administration, which means he\u2019d be in a position to make life difficult for political leaders he disfavors. \u201cI know many of these ministers, and they would be afraid,\u201d one prominent German journalist told me. \u201cI think he\u2019s a guy who doesn\u2019t forget.\u201d\n\nThe Germans are bracing for Trump\u2019s return in other ways. Inside the foreign ministry, officials have mapped out a range of policy areas likely to be destabilized by his reelection\u2014NATO, Ukraine, tariffs, climate change\u2014and are writing detailed proposals for how to deal with the fallout, multiple people told me. Can Trump\u2019s moods be predicted? Who are his confidants, and how can the government get close to them?\n\nThe Germans have a contingency plan for President Joe Biden\u2019s reelection too, but few seem to think they\u2019ll need it. They\u2019re preparing for a third scenario as well: a period of sustained uncertainty about the election\u2019s outcome, accompanied by widespread political violence in the U.S. Nuland, the recently departed State Department official, told me that, based on her conversations with foreign counterparts, Germany isn\u2019t alone in planning for this possibility. \u201cIf you are an adversary of the United States, whether you\u2019re talking about Putin, Iran, or others, it would be a perfect opportunity to exploit the fact that we\u2019re distracted,\u201d she said.\n\nRen\u00e9 Pfister, Der Spiegel\u2019s Washington bureau chief, told me that the first Trump administration left Germany struggling with difficult questions about its relationship with the U.S. Was America still interested in being the leader of the free world, or would it be governed by ruthless self-interest like China and Russia? Could it be counted on to defend its allies if Trump were reelected? \u201cThe Germans always had the impression that, regardless of the political affiliation of the president, you can rely, on the big questions, on the United States,\u201d Pfister told me. \u201cI think this confidence is totally shaken.\u201d\n\nBRUSSELS, BELGIUM\n\nOne afternoon in early April, I listened in as Julianne Smith, the U.S. ambassador who\u2019d hosted the event at Truman Hall, conducted a virtual press briefing from NATO headquarters. Journalists had called in from across Europe, and their questions reflected the unease on the continent. A reporter from Portugal asked about the prospect of NATO countries reinstating military conscription in light of the Russian threat. Another, from Bulgaria, asked Smith to respond to politicians there pushing to withdraw from the alliance. A TV-news correspondent from North Macedonia asked whether Smith thought Russia would take the Balkans next if Ukraine fell.\n\nWhen President Biden set about filling diplomatic posts after his election, he made reassuring rattled allies a top priority. Smith fit the mold of a model ambassador\u2014a career foreign-policy wonk with deep government experience and comfortingly conventional views on America\u2019s role in the world. She also brings a boundless Leslie Knopeian energy to the job, and has been well schooled in the finer points of diplomat-speak: She scarcely mentions a country or region without first establishing friendship\u2014\u201cour friends in the Middle East,\u201d \u201cour friends in Portugal\u201d\u2014and she does not talk to these friends; she only \u201cengages\u201d them (as in \u201cI went to the Vatican quite a while ago to engage them on the war.\u201d).\n\nJulianne Smith (Illustration by The Atlantic. Source: Omar Havana / Getty.)\n\nListening to the press briefing, I thought Smith did well\u2014she sounded calm and confident and relentlessly optimistic. But when the briefing ended, I was ushered into a hallway to await my scheduled interview with the ambassador, and I overheard her fretting to an aide about how she\u2019d handled a question about recent Ukrainian strikes on energy infrastructure inside Russia. American officials, worried about escalation, were reportedly urging Ukraine to stop the attacks, and Smith had responded that the U.S. was \u201cnot particularly supportive of\u201d Ukraine going after targets on Russian soil. Now she was second-guessing herself. Maybe she should have said that the U.S. doesn\u2019t \u201cencourage\u201d the attacks, or that the attacks don\u2019t have America\u2019s \u201cblessing.\u201d (Last week, the Biden administration gave Ukraine permission to use American weapons to attack Russian targets in limited circumstances.)\n\n\u201cMaybe I\u2019m splitting hairs,\u201d I heard Smith say. \u201cJust with my lack of sleep, I didn\u2019t have my game face on. I didn\u2019t nail it.\u201d She sounded exhausted.\n\nDuring our interview, I asked Smith if the job was what she\u2019d expected. She laughed: \u201cNo, no, no.\u201d Part of what had appealed to her about the NATO post was the potential for a 9-to-5 lifestyle. Her kids were still young, and she\u2019d been looking forward to some work-life balance. Then, six weeks after she moved to Brussels, Russia invaded Ukraine, and all of a sudden she was at the center of a geopolitical crisis.\n\nSmith told me her ambassadorial role is unique in that she doesn\u2019t have just one host country to worry about when she makes public statements. She\u2019s speaking to audiences in dozens of countries, and each one needs to hear something different from her. \u201cYou have to sit down and understand: \u2018What is it that\u2019s keeping you awake at night?\u2019\u201d she said. Maybe it\u2019s an errant Russian missile entering their airspace. Or a destabilizing wave of refugees. Or a cyberattack. Or tanks crossing their borders. \u201cThey\u2019re obviously looking to hear time and time again that the U.S. commitment to the alliance, and particularly Article 5, is ironclad and unwavering.\u201d\n\nSmith has developed an arsenal of sanguine talking points to convey this message. She cites U.S. opinion polls showing strong support for NATO. She rehearses America\u2019s long, bipartisan history of standing by its European allies. \u201cFor over seven decades,\u201d she told me, \u201cAmerican presidents of all political stripes have supported this alliance.\u201d\n\nI encountered the same performative positivity in meetings with American diplomats throughout Europe. In Warsaw, Ambassador Mark Brzezinski sat in the airy living room of his residence and talked about the \u201ceconomic efficiencies\u201d America has enjoyed as a result of its alliance with Poland. \u201cThe Poles are spending billions of dollars to protect themselves, mostly buying from U.S. defense contractors,\u201d he said. In Berlin, Ambassador Amy Gutmann met me in an embassy room overlooking the Brandenburg Gate and recounted the heroic role America had played in the massive airlift that broke the 1949 Soviet blockade of West Berlin. \u201cBefore I came here,\u201d Gutmann told me, \u201cPresident Biden said, \u2018Make sure you tell every person you meet in Germany how important the U.S.-German relationship is.\u2019 And I\u2019ve done that.\u201d\n\nBut sentimental rhetoric and gestures of goodwill only go so far. George Kent, the U.S. ambassador to Estonia, told me about an Earth Day photo op he\u2019d taken part in earlier this year. The plan was to plant a tree at the Park of Friendship in central Estonia. Upon arrival, he was greeted by a kindly septuagenarian gardener who\u2019d been participating in the tradition for decades. Kent tried to make small talk about horticulture, but the gardener had other things on his mind: \u201cCan we talk about the vote in Congress?\u201d He wanted the latest news on the Ukraine aid package.\n\nIn interviews, State Department officials in Washington, who requested anonymity so they could speak candidly, acknowledged that efforts to \u201creassure\u201d European allies are largely futile now. What exactly can a U.S. diplomat say, after all, about the fact that the Republican presidential nominee has said he would encourage Russia to \u201cdo whatever the hell they want\u201d to NATO countries that he considers freeloaders?\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not really anything we can do,\u201d one U.S. official told me. European leaders \u201care smart, thoughtful people. The secretary isn\u2019t going to get them in a room and say, \u2018Hey, guys, it\u2019s going to be okay, the election is a lock.\u2019 That\u2019s not something he can promise.\u201d\n\nWARSAW, POLAND\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck is happening in the United States?\u201d\n\nAgnieszka Homa\u0144ska, seemingly startled by her own outburst, slowly placed her hands on the table as if to calm herself. \u201cSorry for being so frank.\u201d We were sitting in a crowded bistro in downtown Warsaw with retro pop art on the walls and American Top 40 playing from the speakers. Homa\u0144ska, a 25-year-old grad student and government worker who wore sneakers and a T-shirt that said BE BRAVE, was trying to explain how Poles her age felt about this year\u2019s U.S. election.\n\nHoma\u0144ska exhibited none of the casual contempt for America often associated with young people in other European capitals. In the history she grew up learning, Americans were the good guys\u2014defeating the Nazi occupiers, tearing down the Iron Curtain. Surveys consistently find that Poland is the most pro-America country in Europe, and one of the few where public opinion doesn\u2019t change based on which party controls the White House. Ronald Reagan is a hero to many here; so is George H. W. Bush. In Poland, the mythology of America\u2014vanquisher of tyrants, keeper of the democratic flame\u2014persists. The U.S. is still a city on a hill.\n\nBut the Trump era punctured Homa\u0144ska\u2019s image of America, as it did for many younger Poles. Trump\u2019s refusal to concede the 2020 election was jarring to those who saw the U.S. as an aspirational democracy. The storming of the Capitol on January 6 \u201cwas broadcast on every television,\u201d she told me. Trump\u2019s criminal charges\u2014and his recent conviction on 34 felony counts in a Manhattan court\u2014have made the news here too. \u201cPeople don\u2019t understand why Trump can still run for president.\u201d (Like others I spoke with, Homa\u0144ska was also confused by the fact that Joe Biden, who struck her as feeble and out of touch, is running again\u2014were these really the best options America could muster? I told her she wasn\u2019t alone in wondering about this.)\n\nMany Poles see Trump through the prism of their own country\u2019s recent politics. The right-wing nationalist Law and Justice party came to power in Poland a year before Trump\u2019s election, and spent the next eight years co-opting democratic institutions, from the courts to the civil service to the public media. The government maintained a cozy relationship with Trump\u2014President Andrzej Duda famously proposed naming an American military base in Poland after him\u2014and he is still popular among conservative Poles. But last year, an intense electoral backlash to Law and Justice produced the largest voter turnout in Poland\u2019s post-Soviet history, driven by young people. The new government, a coalition spanning from the center-left to the center-right, is focused on repairing Poland\u2019s democracy.\n\nAfter the election, Homa\u0144ska decided to postpone her planned studies in Canada so she could help rebuild her country. When I asked her which countries she looked to as democratic role models, she mentioned Finland and Estonia, another former Soviet country that has successfully modernized. \u201cMaybe there is something about the maturity of French democracy,\u201d she added.\n\nAnd America? I asked.\n\nHoma\u0144ska hesitated. \u201cI don\u2019t think that people my age would perceive America as an ideal way to create a democratic society,\u201d she replied. She seemed almost apologetic.\n\nIllustration by Chantal Jahchan. Source: NATO Archives Online.\n\nMany of the Poles I met were especially perplexed by one recent display of U.S. political dysfunction: the struggle to pass a military-aid package for Ukraine earlier this year. Polls showed that a majority of Americans supported the funding. Reporting suggested that most members of Congress favored it too. But somehow, because Trump opposed it, a minority of Republicans in the House had succeeded in holding up the bill for months while Ukraine was forced to ration bullets and let Russian missiles level buildings. Although the aid package finally passed in late April, some Western officials worry that the battlefield advances Russia made during the delay will be difficult to reverse.\n\nThe Russian threat is no abstract matter in Poland, where Prime Minister Donald Tusk has talked about living in a \u201cprewar era\u201d and regularly urges citizens to prepare for a conflict. I heard stories about people stocking up on gold and looking for apartments with basements that could double as bomb shelters. Schools are running duck-and-cover drills, and shooting ranges have become more popular as people realize they might soon need to know how to handle a gun. One Polish woman told me about a phone call she\u2019d received from her aunt, who was wondering if she should restain her wood floors or save her money because her house might be destroyed soon anyway.\n\nIn Warsaw, Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs Radek Sikorski (who is married to the Atlantic writer Anne Applebaum) told me, \u201cyou will feel the physical vulnerability.\u201d Travel 200 miles north and you reach Kaliningrad, where Russia is said to house nuclear weapons; go 200 miles east, and you hit the Ukrainian border. \u201cIt concentrates the mind.\u201d\n\nPoland has recently increased defense spending to 4 percent of its GDP\u2014well beyond the standard of 2 percent set by NATO, and higher even than in the U.S. But officials know they\u2019ll never be able to fend off a hostile Russia alone.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an existential threat,\u201d Aleksandra Wi\u015bniewska, who was elected to Poland\u2019s Parliament last year, told me. Like other Polish politicians I spoke with, Wi\u015bniewska\u2014a 30-year-old former humanitarian aid worker who now sits on the foreign-affairs committee\u2014was reluctant to say anything that might alienate the former, and perhaps future, American president. But she wanted me to understand that the choice American voters make this fall will reverberate beyond U.S. borders.\n\n\u201cI fear that the old United States that we all almost revere,\u201d Wi\u015bniewska told me, is \u201cnow sort of self-sabotaging. And by consequence, it will jeopardize the safety and security of the entire global order.\u201d\n\nFRANKENBERG, GERMANY\n\nThe U.S. Army\u2019s 2nd Cavalry Regiment left Vilseck, Germany, before dawn on April 9 in a convoy of camouflaged jeeps, fuel tankers, armored vehicles, and trucks packed with soldiers and ammunition. They rumbled past windmills and pastoral villages, stopping only for fuel. Speed was essential: The road march to Bemowo Piskie, Poland, was more than 800 miles, and the fate of the Western world was\u2014at least hypothetically\u2014at stake.\n\nThe regiment was training for a long-dreaded crisis scenario: a Russian invasion of the Suwa\u0142ki Gap. The 60-mile stretch of Polish farmland is sparsely populated but strategically important. If Russian forces annexed the territory, they could effectively seal off Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia from the rest of NATO. To save the Baltic states, allies in Northern Europe would have to mobilize quickly.\n\nDuring a refueling stop at a German barracks in Frankenberg, U.S. Army officers rattled off facts to me about the Stryker, a lightweight armored vehicle that looks like a tank but can drive up to 60 miles an hour, and demonstrated a language-translation app they\u2019d developed to facilitate communication among allied troops. The drill they were conducting that day was part of a monthslong NATO military exercise\u2014the largest since the end of the Cold War\u2014involving all 32 allied countries; more than 1,000 combat vehicles; dozens of aircraft carriers, frigates, and battleships; and 90,000 troops. Although NATO officials have been careful not to single out Russia by name, the intended audience for the war games was clear. \u201cAre exercises like this designed to send a message? They are, absolutely,\u201d Colonel Martin O\u2019Donnell told me as soldiers in fatigues milled around nearby. \u201cThe message is that we\u2019re here. We\u2019re ready. We have the capability to work with our allies and partners and meet you, potential adversary, wherever you may be.\u201d\n\nBut the demonstration in Frankenberg sent another, perhaps less convenient, message as well. The convoy rushing to confront a theoretical Russian invasion was composed almost entirely of U.S. soldiers driving U.S. vehicles filled with U.S.-made guns and bullets and missiles. They\u2019d link up with military units from other NATO countries eventually. But if America were removed from the equation, would the battle group in Bemowo Piskie stand a chance?\n\nWhether Trump wins or not, there\u2019s a growing consensus in Europe that the strain of American politics he represents\u2014a throwback to the hard-edged isolationism of the 1920s and \u201930s\u2014isn\u2019t going away. It\u2019s become common in the past year for politicians to talk about the need for European \u201cdefense autonomy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t just flip a coin every four years and hope that Michigan voters will vote in the right direction,\u201d Benjamin Haddad, a member of France\u2019s National Assembly, said at an event earlier this year. \u201cWe have to take matters in our own hand.\u201d\n\nWhat exactly that would look like is a subject of intense debate. Italy\u2019s foreign minister recently proposed forming a European Union army (an idea that\u2019s been raised and rejected many times in the past). Others have suggested diverting resources from NATO to a separate European defense alliance (though European countries are not immune to the kind of populist nationalism that could make such alliances dysfunctional). Replacing the so-called nuclear umbrella provided by the U.S. arsenal would require countries such as Germany and Poland to develop their own nuclear stockpiles, to supplement the small ones France and the United Kingdom already have.\n\nWithin NATO, the immediate priority is \u201cTrump-proofing\u201d the alliance. In the past 18 months, Finland and Sweden have joined, each bringing relatively capable and high-tech militaries. Secretary-General Stoltenberg has also proposed shifting responsibility for Ukrainian arms deliveries from the U.S. to NATO in case the next administration decides to abandon the war.\n\nMost notably, allied countries have dramatically increased their own military spending. I spoke with several officials who grudgingly credited Trump for this development\u2014something NATO officials and U.S. presidents had spent decades advocating for unsuccessfully. In 2017, when Trump took office, only three allies, plus the U.S., were spending at least 2 percent of their GDP on defense. This year, that number is expected to rise to at least 18. Trump\u2019s criticism of paltry defense budgets was not only effective, Stoltenberg told me, but fair. \u201cEuropean allies have not spent enough for many years,\u201d he said. (No doubt Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine also factored into the increased spending.)\n\nEven with the funding influx, many officials believe Europe still has a long way to go before it could defend itself alone. The U.S. has some 85,000 troops currently stationed in Europe\u2014more than the entire militaries of Belgium, Sweden, and Portugal combined\u2014and provides essential intelligence gathering, ballistic-missile defense, and air-force capabilities. \u201cDreaming about strategic autonomy for Europe is a wonderful vision for maybe the next 50 years,\u201d Ischinger, the former German ambassador, told me. \u201cBut right now, we need America more than ever.\u201d\n\nThat reality has left politicians and diplomats across Europe honing their theories of Trump-ego management ahead of the U.S. election. To some, the former president\u2019s emotional volatility represents a grave threat. The former diplomatic official in Berlin told me that in May 2020, Merkel called Trump to inform him that she wouldn\u2019t be traveling to Washington for the G7 summit out of concern for COVID. Trump was enraged, according to the diplomat, who requested anonymity to describe a private conversation, and the call grew heated. A week later, Trump announced plans to permanently withdraw nearly 10,000 U.S. troops from Germany\u2014a move seen within Merkel\u2019s government as a petty act of revenge. (Biden later reversed the order; a spokesperson for the Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nOthers think Trump\u2019s ego could make him easier to manipulate. \u201cHe\u2019s very transactional, and he\u2019s very narcissistic,\u201d the senior NATO official, who\u2019s met Trump multiple times, told me. \u201cAnd if you combine the two, then you can sell him\u2014\u201d the official paused. He recited an expression in his native language. Roughly translated, it meant \u201cYou can sell him turnips as if they\u2019re lemons.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s striking about these calculations is how thoroughly allies have already adjusted their perception of the U.S. relationship. I noticed a certain pattern in my conversations with European political leaders and diplomats: At some point in almost every interview, the European would begin pitching me on how much the U.S. benefits economically from the alliance. Preserving peace in Europe has sustained decades of lucrative trade for U.S. companies. A broader Russian war on the continent would be felt in the average American\u2019s pocketbook. I later learned that these talking points were being encouraged by NATO officials as well as the U.S. State Department. The thinking behind the strategy is that Americans need to hear why supporting European allies is in their self-interest.\n\n\u201cThey keep telling us how important it is to go and convince the housewives in Wisconsin and the farmers in Iowa,\u201d a senior official from an allied country grumbled to me. \u201cHow many Americans are going to the housewives of southern Estonia or \u2026 the countryside in France to tell why Europe should stand by the United States?\u201d He noted that the alliance protects the U.S. as well.\n\nThe more I listened to prime ministers and parliamentarians deliver the same earnest spiel, the more dispiriting I found it. At its most idealistic, the transatlantic alliance has always been about a shared commitment to democratic values. Now Europeans are bracing for an America that behaves like any other transactional superpower. Several officials expressed fears that Trump would turn America\u2019s NATO membership into a kind of protection racket, threatening to abandon Europe unless this ally offers better trade terms, or that ally helps investigate a political enemy.\n\n\u201cWe are exposed,\u201d Bagger, the German state secretary, told me. Europe\u2019s alliance with America, he said, \u201chas served as our life insurance for the last 70 years.\u201d\n\nAnd with Vladimir Putin seizing territory in Europe and trying to unravel NATO, what choice would these countries have but to accept Trump\u2019s terms?\n\nNARVA, ESTONIA\n\nThe city of Narva sits on Estonia\u2019s eastern border, separated from Russia by a river and a heavily guarded bridge. Some experts believe that if World War III breaks out in the coming years, this is where it will begin. The city is overwhelmingly populated by ethnic Russians, many of whom don\u2019t speak Estonian and are therefore ineligible for citizenship. Western officials fear Putin might try to use the same playbook he developed in Crimea\u2014enlisting Russian separatists to stoke unrest and create a pretense for annexing the city. Such a move would effectively dare the West to go to war with a nuclear power over a small Estonian city, or else watch the credibility of their vaunted alliance collapse. NATO calls this \u201cthe Narva scenario.\u201d\n\nOn a cold spring morning, I drove two hours from the Estonian capital of Tallinn and arrived at the border-crossing station, a red-brick box of a building on the edge of the Narva River. There I met Aleksandr Kazmin, a border guard with close-cropped hair and a friendly face who spoke broken English with a thick Russian accent. He wore a patch on his coat that said Politsei and a gun on his hip.\n\nThe border checkpoint once saw a steady stream of commuters and tourists traveling back and forth between Russia and Estonia\u2014at its peak, Kazmin told me, the station processed 27,000 people in a single day. But travel dropped dramatically once the war in Ukraine started. In the months following the invasion, many of the people coming across the Narva border were refugees. Then, earlier this year, Russia closed its side of the road for \u201crenovations,\u201d meaning that the only way to cross the bridge now is by foot. On the morning I visited, I saw a thin trickle of travelers\u2014moms pushing strollers, young people with backpacks\u2014shuffle in and out of the station.\n\nKazmin told me that the war had divided Narva, as it had the wider Russian diaspora. Those who are \u201calready integrated in Estonian society\u201d generally oppose Putin\u2019s aggression, he said, but some \u201cdon\u2019t want to integrate\u2014they are living in Russian-media world.\u201d He rolled his eyes before muttering in resignation, \u201cNothing to do. It\u2019s their choice.\u201d\n\nI asked Kazmin if I could walk to the actual border, and he obliged. As we made our way across the bridge, passing a tangle of barbed wire that had been pushed to the side, he warned me that we might see a Russian border guard filming us from the checkpoint on the other side. Kazmin didn\u2019t know exactly why the Russians did this\u2014he guessed it was some kind of intelligence-gathering tactic\u2014but it often happened when he brought a visitor to the bridge.\n\nSure enough, as we got closer, a guard appeared in the distance. He didn\u2019t seem to have a camera, so I asked Kazmin if I could wave at him. Kazmin cautioned against it. Communication between the two sides, even for benign logistical coordination, is strictly regulated: Only specially trained officials at the station are allowed to talk to the Russians, and they do so using a Cold War\u2013era crank phone.\n\nWe stopped when we reached the middle of the bridge. Kazmin told me this was the closest we would get to Russia, explaining that there was no permanent, official border; it was understood that the deepest point of the river was what technically separated the two countries, and that shifts over time. The spot was strangely beautiful. Below us, a current of water rushed toward the Baltic Sea; above us, a flurry of snow fell from the gray sky. Two imposing medieval fortresses faced each other from either side of the river, one built by the occupying Danes in the 13th century, the other by a Muscovite prince two centuries later\u2014twin relics of conquests past. As I took in the view, Kazmin bounced up and down to keep warm, stealing glances at his Russian counterpart.\n\nI thought about how much more precarious the world must feel to those living in a place like this, doing a job like his. The day before my visit to Narva, I had interviewed Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas, who talked about the stakes of preserving the transatlantic alliance. Her country has a population of 1.3 million and is roughly the size of Vermont. She recalled sitting in a meeting with other world leaders shortly after her election where they discussed the Russian threat. \u201cI made a note in my notebook: \u2018For some countries here, talking about security and defense is a nice intellectual discussion,\u2019\u201d Kallas told me. \u201c\u2018For us, it\u2019s existential.\u2019\u201d\n\nAfter dozens of interviews, I\u2019d become desensitized to politicians using this word. But walking back across the bridge, I thought I understood what she meant.\n\nKazmin pointed to a tall flagpole perched beside the Narva station. At the top, the Estonian flag waved in the wind; beneath it, a navy-blue flag with the NATO seal. He said that flag had been installed only a few months earlier. I asked him if he thought the day would ever come when he saw Russian tanks rolling across the bridge. Kazmin got quiet for a moment. He said Russia\u2019s government has long promised that it would not attack the Baltics\u2014but that Putin had said the same thing about Ukraine.\n\n\u201cWhen they tell us they will not do something,\u201d he said, \u201cit means for us that they can do it\u2014or will do it.\u201d",

        "text": "Prince Harry will be in trouble if Donald Trump becomes US president again: Royal Family expert\nFor many reasons, Prince Harry\u2019s memoir \u2018Spare\u2019 landed the Duke of Sussex in trouble. However, what caused legal complications was his admission of drug use. There are speculations about whether his US visa application was included in this declaration.\n\nPeople questioned whether Harry had reported his past drug use on his visa application when he moved to the US. Harry revealed in his book that he had used cocaine, marijuana and magic mushrooms.\n\nAlso Read: Prince William \u2018in a lonely place\u2019 after Kate Middleton\u2019s cancer, King Charles\u2019 health issues The Heritage Foundation is suing the US government to get Prince Harry's immigration records. The Washington think tank wants to see if famous people get special treatment. They are looking at the forms Prince Harry filled out when he arrived in the US on March 14, 2020, because usually, people have to answer if they have used recreational drugs.\n\nFormer BBC royal correspondent Jennie Bond says that, if Harry\u2019s documents reveal any deviation from the usual procedure, it may worry Meghan Markle\u2019s husband.\n\nAlso Read: Prince William, King Charles came \u2018ready for a fight\u2019 during a secret meeting with Prince Harry \"Harry must regret having been so frank about drugs in his book. It really wasn\u2019t a necessary part of the narrative although I understand that he was trying to explain his mental health issues,\" Bond told OK!.\n\n\"But admissions like that can have consequences and, right now, he must be feeling the heat. I think he\u2019s fine as long as the Biden administration continues to back him. But, things could be very different if Trump became president again,\u201d he told the publication.\n\nAlso Read: Meghan Markle to be called 'Princess Henry' if King Charles revokes her royal title However, according to the insider, it seems unlikely that the USA would deport Harry. He believes lawyers would find some way around it. Still, it must be a source of unnecessary worry and embarrassment for Harry at the moment, he said.",

        "text": "Who are the candidates running in the US presidential election?\nPresident Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump will face each other in the US presidential election on Nov 5 in what looks set to be a divisive, closely fought contest. Several third-party hopefuls are also running.\n\nHere is a list of the candidates:\n\nRepublican Party\n\nDonald Trump\n\nTrump, 77, on May 30 became the first former US president to be convicted of a crime when a Manhattan jury found him guilty of falsifying documents to cover up a payment to silence a porn star ahead of the 2016 election. He plans to appeal and says he\u2019s innocent. He will be sentenced on July 11, four days before the start of the Republican National Convention, where he is due to be formally nominated to face Biden, having secured enough delegates to set up the first presidential rematch in nearly 70 years.\n\nTrump, in office from 2017-2021, has leveraged his unprecedented legal challenges to solidify support among his base and has cast his third bid for the White House in part as retribution against perceived political enemies. But following his felony conviction, 10% of Republican registered voters said they were less likely to vote for him, rising to 25% among independent registered voters, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump faces 54 charges in three other criminal cases: a federal case involving efforts to subvert the 2020 election, a Georgia election interference case and a federal case in Florida over his handling of classified documents after leaving office. He denies wrongdoing in all the cases.\n\nHowever, the New York hush money trial could be the only one to take place before the Nov. 5 election. Trump has refused to commit to accepting the 2020 election results or to rule out possible violence around the Nov. 5 contest or his sentencing, and is already laying the groundwork to contest his potential election loss. He calls supporters jailed for the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol \u201chostages\u201d and campaigns using increasingly dystopian rhetoric.\n\nIf elected to another four-year term, Trump has vowed revenge on his political enemies and said he would not be a dictator except \u201con day one,\u201d later calling that \u201ca joke.\u201d He also wants the power to replace federal civil service workers with loyalists. On foreign policy, Trump sparked criticism from Western leaders for saying the US would not defend NATO members that did not spend enough on defense and would encourage Russia to attack them. He also pressed congressional Republicans to stall military aid for Ukraine before later reversing course.\n\nTrump has made immigration one of his top domestic campaign issues, declaring he would carry out mass deportations, utilize the National Guard and possibly federal troops, end birthright citizenship and expand a travel ban on people from certain countries. He has referred to some migrants as \u201canimals\u201d and has not ruled out building detention camps on US soil. On abortion, Trump takes credit for the US Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade and has said it should remain a state issue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile he has criticized some Republican-led state actions such as those in Florida and Arizona, he said he would allow Republican-led states to track women\u2019s pregnancies and prosecute those who violate their state bans. Trump has said he does not support a ban on access to birth control . He promised to eliminate Obamacare health insurance before saying in an April 11 video that he would not \u201cterminate\u201d it, and he has pledged to halt federal funding to schools with vaccine mandates.\n\nHe has also vowed to undo much of the Biden administration\u2019s work to fight climate change. Trump has yet to announce a vice presidential running mate, but several possibilities have been floated, with some attending his New York trial.\n\nDemocratic Party\n\nJoe Biden\n\nBiden launched his 2020 candidacy as an urgent bid to defend American liberties and protect democracy and has cast his reelection bid in the same light, saying Trump threatens the future of American democracy.\n\nHe faced no serious challenger for the Democratic nomination, which he clinched in March. November\u2019s election will be much tougher, with the most recent Reuters/Ipsos poll putting Biden\u2019s national support at 41% and Trump at 39%, although Trump leads him in most of the battleground states that will decide the election. Biden, already the oldest US president ever at 81, must convince voters he is more fit for office than Trump, who is just four years his junior, while combating low approval ratings that are worse among younger voters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe economy will also likely be a major factor in determining whether Biden returns to the White House. While the US escaped an anticipated recession and is growing faster than economists expected, inflation and the cost of essentials are weighing on voters\u2019 minds. Biden pushed through massive economic stimulus and infrastructure spending packages to boost US industrial output, but has received little credit for it from voters so far.\n\nHis campaign has highlighted new semiconductor manufacturing plants, housing plansand other economic efforts. Two labor groups, the United Auto Workers union and the North America\u2019s Building Trade Union, have endorsed him. With Vice President Kamala Harris, he has unveiled a new coalition to court Black voters, a critical voting bloc that has historically voted for Democrats but is showing signs of weakness for Biden\u2019s candidacy. Biden\u2019s handling of immigration policy has been criticized by Republicans and some Democrats as he has struggled with millions of migrants crossing the US-Mexico border.\n\nOn June 4, he signed an executive order to curb migration along the southern border, under which migrants caught illegally crossing the border could be denied the chance to claim asylum and quickly deported or turned back to Mexico. He has led the response of Western governments to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, persuading allies to punish Russia and support Kyiv, and secured additional funding in April after a months-long battle with congressional Republicans.\n\nBiden has also provided military aid to Israel in its conflict with Hamas while urging more humanitarian assistance. But he has faced intensifying criticism from many Democrats and younger voters for continuing to provide military aid to Israel and largely failing to curb Israel\u2019s military offensive in Gaza that has killed more than 36,000 people, including many women and children, according to Palestinian health officials. Reuters/Ipsos polling shows the issue has divided the party. On May 31, Biden presented a new Israeli plan that proposes a fresh Gaza ceasefire in exchange for the release of hostages, and called on Hamas to agree to the new offer. \u201cIt\u2019s time for this war to end,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarianne Williamson\n\nBest-selling author and self-help guru Marianne Williamson, 71, relaunched her long-shot 2024 presidential bid focusing on \u201cjustice and love\u201d less than one month after dropping out.\n\nIn a February statement, she said she was getting back in to fight Trump\u2019s \u201cdark and authoritarian vision\u201d after earlier suspending it because she was losing \u201cthe horse race.\u201d\n\nWilliamson previously ran as a Democrat in the 2020 presidential primary but dropped out before voting began.\n\nIndependents\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr\n\nAn anti-vaccine activist and environmental advocate, Kennedy, 70, is running as an independent after initially challenging Biden for the Democratic nomination. While he lags in overall polling, Kennedy could siphon votes from Trump and Biden, with a May Reuters/Ipsos poll showing he was backed by 10% of respondents.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe son of Democratic US Senator Robert F. Kennedy, who was assassinated in 1968 during his own presidential bid, Kennedy has drawn rebukes from his famous family, which has publicly backed Biden. Kennedy, who chose wealthy lawyer Nicole Shanahan as his running mate, supports Israel and has questioned a six-week ceasefire backed by Biden.\n\nHe said he views the US southern border situation as a humanitarian crisis and opposes Trump\u2019s border wall. He has also vowed to repeal parts of Biden\u2019s climate bill over tax breaks he says help the oil industry. Kennedy has taken different positions on abortion rights, including restrictions on when a woman can access an abortion.

The Democracy 2024 initiative is working to combat a \u201ccrisis of trust\u201d in the world today, and the growing cynicism that many young people feel toward the American democratic system .",
        "text": "Democracy 2024: Hickenlooper, Roth talk Political Optimism and Opportunity\nUnited States Senator John Hickenlooper \u201974, MA \u201980, Hon. \u201910 didn\u2019t set out to become a politician when he graduated from Wesleyan half a century ago. He wanted to be a geologist, but when that didn\u2019t pan out, he found success as an entrepreneur and brewery owner in Denver at the height of the craft brewing craze. When he ran for mayor of Denver at the age of 49, Hickenlooper never anticipated that national politics would play such a huge role in his second act. But after serving as mayor for two terms, he became governor of Colorado for another eight years, and he now represents the Centennial State as a U.S. Senator.\n\n\u201cThe Wesleyan education does a lot to show you that every person has value,\u201d said Hickenlooper. \u201cThat\u2019s great training if you want to get into politics; a lot of politics is blending different networks together and making sure people get along. That\u2019s really what a mayor does day in, day out, to solve problems by bringing people together and then making sure everyone feels heard, everyone\u2019s validated.\u201d\n\nHickenlooper joined President Michael S. Roth \u201978 in conversation in the Goldsmith Family Theater as part of a WESeminar titled \u201cDemocracy 2024\u201d on May 25 for Reunion + Commencement Weekend 2024. The theater was packed with many of Hickenlooper\u2019s old classmates as the Class of 1974 returned to campus for its 50th Reunion.\n\nIn the months leading up to another critical presidential election, Wesleyan\u2019s Democracy 2024 initiative is working to combat what Roth referred to as a \u201ccrisis of trust\u201d in the world today, and the growing cynicism that many young people feel toward the American democratic system. D2024 sponsors events and speakers that encourage civil discourse and liberal learning in the world beyond campus and provides opportunities for students to participate in the public sphere. The Jewett Center for Community Partnership\u2019s Political Engagement Fund, for example, offers micro-grants to support students who want to work for campaigns or civic causes around the country.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to get our students to play a role in the next six months at whatever level they want, however they want to do it, whatever political party they want to work for,\u201d said Roth, \u201cbut to become used to compromise, conversation, listening, and being part of the political system, rather than being a critic on the outside of the system.\u201d\n\nHickenlooper spoke about some of the structural problems plaguing our modern democracy \u2014 from out-of-control gerrymandering to trade association lobbyists. But despite mainstream media\u2019s focus on the loudest, most extreme politicians on either side of the aisle, Hickenlooper believes America is really more moderate than it appears. The kind of change he works toward in Washington, D.C., is slow-moving but necessary, achieving progress one conversation at a time.\n\nRoth added, \u201cGiving people a sense that they can make a difference, but it may not be a difference at the scale of a history textbook, but it can make a difference and [it\u2019s] really important for the lives of somebody getting health care in their community or someone looking for housing in their community.\u201d\n\nThe Senator concluded his remarks with a reading of \u201cTo be of use\u201d by American progressive activist and poet Marge Piercy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to learn, to change yourself and become better,\u201d Hickenlooper said summarizing the poem\u2019s main themes. \u201cIt\u2019s even more important that you change the world around you and make it better for others. We\u2019ve got to remind our kids that their spirit and their optimism, their determination to face the ridiculous challenges that we face right now is also an opportunity.\u201d",

        "text": "How the Electoral College increases disinformation risks\nWhile public opinion optimists may be right in a number of cases, what they ignore in presidential elections is the manner in which the Electoral College increases disinformation risks. That is because in all but two states the Electoral College votes are awarded on a winner-take-all basis\u2014hence very small vote margins can yield all the Electoral College votes. Have a look at the vote margins in some key states in 2016. In the five closest states, the winning candidate (Trump in four states and Clinton in one state) triumphed with a miniscule percentage of the vote.\n\nThere has been a long debate over the power of propaganda to influence public opinion. Are people susceptible to the latest wild rumor circulating on TikTok or are they, as writer Joseph Bernstein and others argue, able to hold independent beliefs and resist false narratives?\n\nThe same pattern of a close election repeats itself in 2020 . False news purveyors didn\u2019t have to convince everyone voting in the closest states. They merely had to shift a miniscule number of people.\n\nFalse news purveyors don\u2019t have to persuade 99% of American voters to be influential but simply a tiny amount in Michigan, New Hampshire, or Wisconsin. In each of those places, a shift of one percent of the vote or less based on false narratives would have altered the outcome.\n\nIf the United States had direct popular voting for president, disinformation likely would pose little risk in 2024. We would not have to worry about a small number of swing areas as candidates would focus on voters from many states across the country. A vote in Arizona would be no more important than a vote in Florida, Texas, or Illinois. Without the Electoral College, it would be harder for those generating fake videos and audios to target specific geographic areas. Candidates would realize that any appeals in Phoenix, Detroit, or Milwaukee based on false information about voting, climate change, public health, or race relations could backfire and be offset by votes elsewhere for the other candidate.\n\nFear about a possible backlash is one of the major factors limiting propaganda effectiveness. People who don\u2019t like blatant attempts to manipulate elections always can serve as a counterweight to those peddling falsehoods. If voters in California, Texas, or Florida object to false videos or narratives in Arizona that clearly run contrary to agreed-upon facts, they can in a direct popular election offset disinformation targeting voters in swing states. It is due to the existence of the Electoral College that the 2024 election could come down to a small group of voters in swing areas and enable disinformation disseminators to run highly targeted campaigns with questionable appeals in those places.\n\nFalse targeted appeals are not the only election risk in 2024. Due to the Electoral College, under the radar manipulation could focus on a small number of voters without much visibility from anyone else. Candidates and their supporters can deploy fake robocalls, direct mail pitches, or launch social media campaigns that might be invisible to opposition candidates, the mainstream media, and independent fact-checkers. Disinformation could thrive without any public accountability from other political forces. Those efforts could lie so far below public visibility that disinformation could work without others even knowing about it or having a chance to rebut it.\n\nThe winner-take-all nature of state voting under the Electoral College further elevates the possible role of third party and independent candidates in deciding the outcome in particular areas. Disinformation disseminators don\u2019t have to move voters from Biden to Trump or vice versa to be influential. Instead, disinformation could be effective by moving voters from Biden or Trump to Robert Kennedy, Jr, Jill Stein, or Cornel West. If any of those minor candidates draw votes disproportionately from Biden or Trump based on fake news, that effectively elects the other major party nominee through false material.\n\nIn all these respects, the United States faces disinformation risks that go way beyond the situation that exists in most other countries that are voting this year. There are major elections taking place in India, Indonesia, Europe, Mexico, and elsewhere. But in most of these nations, there is some form of direct popular voting for the chief executive or proportional voting for political parties that minimize the overall disinformation risks. It is harder to manipulate an entire country than a few cities in a couple of states as is the case currently in the United States due to the Electoral College.\n\nThe anachronistic Electoral College increases the importance of tiny groups of voters. There could be false information that is discounted by the vast swath of U.S. public opinion yet remains persuasive to the small number of people in Arizona, Michigan, or Wisconsin who will decide the presidential election.\n\nAt a time when America is plagued by extreme polarization and partisanship, and some Americans are eager to believe just about anything that reflects badly on the other side, the Electoral College elevates the power of questionable material to influence outcomes. False narratives could be completely ineffective with almost all U.S. voters but still decide the national election. It would be tragic if the 2024 election were decided by a small number of voters in a few states who cast their ballots on the basis of blatantly fake information.",

Instead, economic concerns, particularly over inflation, remain front and center.\n\nThat said, the economy is one of several policy areas, along with immigration and the war in Gaza, where respondents were less likely to pick Biden as the best candidate to handle the issue, illustrating a potentially deeper problem for his campaign with younger Americans.\n\n\n\nBiden\u2019s 2020 coalition is missing in 2024\n\nBroken down by race and ethnicity, Biden has particularly lost ground with Black and Latino young people.\n\nLoading...\n\nIn 2020, 89% of Black voters aged 18-29 voted for Biden, as well as 78% of those aged 30-44. In the latest GenForward survey, just 33% said they would support him if the election were held today and 23% chose Trump.\n\nTrump is beating Biden among young Latino voters by a four-point margin. It\u2019s a significant drop in support for Biden compared to four years ago, when he won 69% of Latino voters under 30, and 62% of those 30-44.\n\nWhen looking at a sample of only registered voters, the numbers improve for Biden and push him back ahead of Trump with Latinos, but the margins remain slim. Biden\u2019s support with Black voters only ticks up two points to 35%.\n\n\u201cYoung people are saying to Joe Biden, \u2018win me, win my vote,\u2019\u201d said Cathy Cohen, a professor at the University of Chicago who founded and leads the GenForward poll. \u201c'Don't assume I'm going to vote for you now.'\u201d\n\nThat statement rings true particularly for individuals still searching for a different candidate, even as the presidential primary season is virtually finished. Among both Black and Latino Americans, about a quarter said they would vote for someone else.\n\nThere are several paths for the \u201csomeone else\u201d voter and Cohen argued opinions could likely change as the election nears closer.\n\n\u201cThis is how young people are kind of showing up right now as we begin to enter the summer,\u201d she added. \u201cCome November, when there is something at stake\u2026 those numbers could look a little different.\u201d\n\nBut in GenForward\u2019s June survey four years ago \u2014 which did not include third-party candidates \u2014 Biden did have considerably more support. He received backing from a majority of Black, Latino and Asian Americans and an average of just 15% said they would vote for someone else.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe latest poll\u2019s inclusion of third-party candidates Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Cornel West may also indicate how additional names on the ballot could splinter the youth vote in the fall. A similar result was reflected in the latest Harvard Youth Poll, Biden defeats Trump in a head-to-head matchup, but when third-party candidates are included, the margin decreases.\n\n\n\nEconomic issues are driving voters, not the Israel-Hamas war\n\nInflation ranks first across all groups when asked what issue is most important when voting this fall. Concerns around economic growth come second for Black, Latino and AAPI young people, while \u201cthreats to American Democracy\u201d does for whites.\n\nTo Cohen, a lot of Biden\u2019s problems revolve around the current state of the economy, and though inflation is slowing, she argues these shifts haven\u2019t fully resonated.\n\n\u201cThese young people are dealing with increasing rents, increasing food prices, increasing gas costs, and their incomes are less flexible, I would argue, than older folks,\u201d she explained.\n\nGen Z and millennials are not alone in prioritizing economic issues. It consistently ranks number one across generations and racial groups. In this latest poll, issues often linked to younger voters, like abortion rights, curbing gun violence, addressing climate change and ending the war in Gaza, appear lower on the list of important issues.\n\nLoading...\n\nWhen asked to choose which presidential candidate would do the best on issues relating to immigration and inflation, Trump has the most support overall. But, in the question, which gave respondents the options of Trump, Biden, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Cornel West and \u201cnone of them,\u201d Trump is closely followed by \u201cnone of them.\u201d\n\nOne of Biden\u2019s areas of relative strength, abortion access, has been a cornerstone of his campaign. Biden leads by just three points followed by the option, \u201cnone of them.\u201d\n\nIn the 2022 midterms, safeguarding abortion access was the top motivator for voters under 30, and they turned out overwhelmingly for Democratic candidates.\n\nIt remains an important electoral issue in the GenForward poll: a third of overall respondents said they would only vote for a candidate who shares their views on abortion, and nearly half agree that individuals should, \u201calways be able to obtain an abortion as a matter of personal choice.\u201d\n\nOn the Israel-Hamas war, just 4% of young Americans overall said it\u2019s the most important voting issue for them. A knowledge gap on the topic also exists. Respondents were most likely to choose \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d in response to questions regarding support and sympathy for Israel and the Palestinian people, as well as who to blame for the conflict when given the options of Hamas, the Israeli government, the U.S. government, the Iranian government and all of the above.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAmong AAPI young people, the issue holds more weight, 10% say it\u2019s the most important issue when voting in the election and six in 10 want a permanent ceasefire.\n\nAnd young people overall support an end to the war, with 53% backing a permanent ceasefire.\n\nThat all said, Biden holds low approval ratings over his handling of the conflict, with just 12% support, compared to 49% disapproval and 39% choosing neither option.\n\nIt all underscores the complex choice many undecided young Americans have this fall, Cohen argued, especially for voters of color, who may typically align themselves with Democratic values.\n\nThe likely choice: get back on board with Biden or effectively stay home.\n\n\u201cIn a swing state, if the Biden campaign is dependent on those young people and they don't vote, in some ways it is a vote for Trump,\u201d Cohen said.\n\n\u201cI think we don't take seriously enough,\u201d she continued, \u201cwhat does it mean if enough young Black people or enough young folks of color decide just not to vote?\u201d",

        "text": "Four Men from Pennsylvania Arrested on Multiple Felony and Misdemeanor Charges for Actions During Jan. 6 Capitol Breach\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Four men from Pennsylvania were arrested today on multiple felony and misdemeanor charges related to their alleged conduct during the Jan. 6, 2021, breach of the U.S. Capitol. Their alleged actions and the actions of others disrupted a joint session of the U.S. Congress convened to ascertain and count the electoral votes related to the 2020 presidential election.\n\nCharged in a criminal complaint filed in the District of Columbia are Scott Slater Sr., 56, Scott Alex Slater Jr., 26, and Jarret Carl Scott, 48, all of Saylorsburg, Pennsylvania, and Tighe John Scott, 75, of Pen Argyl, Pennsylvania.\n\nScott Slater Sr. is charged with a felony offense of obstruction of law enforcement during a civil disorder, and misdemeanor offenses of entering or remaining in restricted buildings or grounds, disorderly or disruptive conduct in a restricted building or grounds, and disorderly or disruptive conduct in a Capitol building or grounds.\n\nScott Alex Slater Jr. is charged with three felony offenses, including obstruction of law enforcement during a civil disorder, assaulting, resisting, or impeding certain officers, and assaulting, resisting, or impeding certain officers with a deadly or dangerous weapon. In addition to the felonies, Slater Jr. is charged with five misdemeanor offenses, including entering or remaining in restricted buildings or grounds, disorderly or disruptive conduct in a restricted building or grounds, engaging in violence in a restricted building or grounds, disorderly or disruptive conduct in a Capitol building or grounds, physical violence in Capitol building or grounds.\n\nJarrett Carl Scott is charged with two felony offenses, including obstruction of law enforcement during a civil disorder and assaulting, resisting, or impeding certain officers. In addition to the felonies, Jarrett Scott is charged with five misdemeanor offenses, including entering or remaining in restricted buildings or grounds, disorderly or disruptive conduct in a restricted building or grounds, engaging in violence in a restricted building or grounds, disorderly or disruptive conduct in a Capitol building or grounds, violence in Capitol building or grounds.\n\nTighe John Scott is charged with two felony offenses, including obstruction of law enforcement during a civil disorder and assaulting, resisting, or impeding certain officers. In addition to the felonies, Tighe Scott is charged with five misdemeanor offenses, including entering or remaining in restricted buildings or grounds, disorderly or disruptive conduct in a restricted building or grounds, engaging in violence in a restricted building or grounds, disorderly or disruptive conduct in a Capitol building or grounds, violence in Capitol building or grounds.\n\nThe FBI arrested the four men today in Pennsylvania and they are expected to make their initial appearances in the Middle District of Pennsylvania.\n\nAccording to court documents, body-worn camera and publicly available footage identified the four men, collectively known as the Scotts and Slaters. The four men entered the restricted grounds of the U.S. Capitol building on Jan. 6, 2021, and physically engaged with police officers. Publicly available footage shows that the Scotts and the Slaters attended the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally earlier in the day on January 6th and later made their way to the Upper Northwest Terrace of the Capitol building.\n\nHere, at about 4:00 p.m., the Scotts and Slaters verbally harassed a line of police officers as Slater Jr. picked up a flagpole and allegedly threw it towards the line, striking one of the officers. A few seconds later, Slater Jr. allegedly picked up an \u201cAREA CLOSED\u201d sign and threw that sign at the line of officers.\n\nCourt documents say that at about 4:48 p.m., the Scotts and the Slaters physically engaged with and confronted police officers near the Upper Northwest Terrace of the Capitol building as police officers yelled, \u201cPolice, move back\u201d and attempted to clear the area of rioters.\n\nDuring this confrontation with police, it is alleged that Tighe Scott engaged with police, physically struck riot shields, and attempted to rip a riot shield out of an officer\u2019s hands. It is also alleged that Slater Sr., holding a golf club, physically pushed and resisted against police shields. It is alleged that Jarrett Scott, also holding a golf club, physically pushed and resisted against police shields as well.\n\nFinally, it is alleged that Slater Jr. physically resisted police officers in this area, including by using his bodyweight to resist police, jabbing an officer with his elbow, charging at officers, and ripping a riot shield from an officer\u2019s grasp.\n\nThis case is being prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia and the Department of Justice National Security Division's Counterterrorism Section. Valuable assistance was provided by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania.\n\nThe case is being investigated by the FBI's Philadelphia and Washington Field Offices. Valuable assistance was provided by the U.S. Capitol Police and the Metropolitan Police Department.\n\nJarrett Scott was identified as BOLO (Be on the Lookout) #441. Tighe Scott was identified as BOLO #451. Scott Slater Sr. was identified as BOLO #498 and Scott Slater Jr. was identified as BOLO #440.\n\nIn the 40 months since Jan. 6, 2021, more than 1,424 individuals have been charged in nearly all 50 states for crimes related to the breach of the U.S. Capitol, including more than 500 individuals charged with assaulting or impeding law enforcement, a felony. The investigation remains ongoing.\n\nAnyone with tips can call 1-800-CALL-FBI (800-225-5324) or visit tips.fbi.gov.\n\nA complaint is merely an allegation, and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.",

        "text": "Biden: \u2018every reason\u2019 to believe Netanyahu is prolonging Gaza war for political gain\nJoe Biden has said that there is \u201cevery reason\u201d to draw the conclusion that Benjamin Netanyahu is prolonging the war in Gaza for his own political self-preservation.\n\nBiden made the remarks about the Israeli prime minister in an interview with Time magazine published on Tuesday morning, drawing a sharp response from the Israeli government, which accused the US president of straying from diplomatic norms.\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s popularity plummeted after the 7 October attack by Hamas, which exposed serious flaws in Israeli security. Most political observers say Netanyahu would lose elections if they were held now, and would be forced into opposition, facing court hearings on corruption charges. But elections have been put off until the war is over, or at least until major military operations are deemed to have been completed.\n\nTime asked Biden whether he believed Netanyahu was \u201cprolonging the war for his own political self-preservation\u201d.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to comment on that,\u201d the president said in response, but added: \u201cThere is every reason for people to draw that conclusion.\u201d\n\nHe went on to discuss some of the internal political problems Netanyahu was facing before the war.\n\nAsked if he wanted to clarify Biden\u2019s response, the US national security council spokesperson, John Kirby, said: \u201cI think the president was very clear in his answer on that, and we\u2019ll let the prime minister speak to his own politics. The president was referencing what many critics have said.\u201d\n\nLater on Tuesday, Biden appeared to tone down his criticism of Netanyahu.\n\nAsked whether Netanyahu was \u201cplaying politics with the war\u201d, Biden said: \u201cI don\u2019t think so. He\u2019s trying to work out a serious problem he has.\u201d\n\nIn response to the Time interview, the Israeli government spokesperson, David Mencer, said Biden\u2019s remarks about Netanyahu and Israeli politics were \u201coutside the diplomatic norms of every right-thinking country\u201d.\n\nOver the course of the wide-ranging interview in Time, Biden was also asked about the allegations, under investigation by the international criminal court (ICC) and the international court of justice (ICJ), that Israel is committing war crimes in Gaza. The president gave an ambivalent response.\n\n\u201cThe answer is it\u2019s uncertain and has been investigated by the Israelis themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ICC is something that we don\u2019t recognise. But one thing is certain: the people in Gaza, the Palestinians, have suffered greatly, for lack of food, water, medicine, etc. And a lot of innocent people have been killed.\u201d\n\nBiden pointed out that Hamas also held responsibility for the bloodshed in Israel and Gaza.\n\nAsked specifically if Israel was using \u201cstarvation of civilians as a method of warfare\u201d, a charge being pursued by the ICC prosecutor, Karim Khan.\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think that,\u201d Biden said. But he then said: \u201cI think they\u2019ve engaged in activity that is inappropriate.\u201d\n\nBiden said that when he visited Israel in the wake of the 7 October attack, he told Netanyahu\u2019s government: \u201cDon\u2019t make the same mistake we did going after [Osama] bin Laden. The idea of occupying Afghanistan, the idea that you had nuclear arsenals in Iraq, that were \u2026 simply not true. And it led to endless wars. Don\u2019t make the mistakes we made.\u201d\n\nBut Biden concluded by saying the Israelis were indeed \u201cmaking that mistake\u201d.\n\nThe Time interview was published at a politically sensitive moment as Biden tries to convince Israeli and Hamas officials to negotiate a ceasefire deal in Gaza. It was conducted on May 28 before he announced his peace plan.",

        "text": "Cultural Issues and the 2024 Election\nImmigration, gender identity, racial diversity and views of a changing society\n\n(All photos via Getty Images)\n\nNote: A new report is available as of Aug. 26, 2024: \u201c The Political Values of Harris and Trump Supporters .\u201d The report and its accompanying detailed tables update the material in this report, examining how these issues are viewed by supporters of Kamala Harris and Donald Trump.\n\nVote preference used in the new report was measured in a survey conducted Aug. 5-11, 2024, after Joe Biden had exited the presidential race. The values data in the new report was measured in the same survey used in this report, conducted April 8-14.\n\nThe patterns of opinion in the new report are largely the same as those discussed in this report (which used Biden/Trump preferences as of April).\n\nHow we did this Pew Research Center conducted this study to understand voters\u2019 political values related to cultural issues in the context of the 2024 election. For this analysis, we surveyed 8,709 adults, including 7,166 registered voters, from April 8 to 14, 2024. Everyone who took part in this survey is a member of the Center\u2019s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. This way nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. Read more about the ATP\u2019s methodology. Here are the questions used for the report and its methodology.\n\nThe 2024 presidential campaign is taking place amid intense debates over such topics as immigration, growing racial and ethnic diversity in the United States, the changing American family, crime and reproductive issues.\n\nThese topics sometimes are grouped together as \u201cculture war\u201d or \u201cwoke\u201d issues.\n\nOn most \u2013 but not all \u2013 of these topics, voters who support President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump have starkly different opinions. Yet in many cases, Biden and Trump supporters are themselves sharply divided.\n\nAcross more than 30 measures, some of the widest differences are on issues that have divided Americans for decades: the role of guns in society, as well as race and the legacy of slavery.\n\nYet, Biden and Trump supporters also have very different opinions across many other topics likely to be focal points in the campaign: gender identity and sexual orientation, crime and policing, reproductive issues, the influence of religion on society and the changes that have transformed life in the U.S. in recent decades.\n\nA new survey by Pew Research Center of 8,709 adults \u2013 including 7,166 registered voters \u2013 conducted April 8-14, 2024, examines the political values of the Biden and Trump coalitions that underlie policy attitudes in many of these areas.\n\nJump to read about Biden and Trump supporters\u2019 views on: Race and racial diversity | Immigration and language | American history | Gender and family | Gender identity and sexual orientation | Religion | Crime and policing | Guns\n\nAmong the major findings:\n\nEnduring divisions on race and the legacy of slavery. Just 27% of registered voters who support Trump say the legacy of slavery affects the position of Black people in America today a great deal or fair amount; 73% say it has little or no impact.\n\nOpinions among Biden supporters are nearly the opposite: 79% say slavery\u2019s legacy still affects the position of Black people, while 20% say it has not too much or no effect.\n\nWide gaps on gender identity and same-sex marriage. While Americans have complex opinions on gender identity and transgender rights, a growing share of voters (65%) say that whether a person is a man or woman is determined by the sex they were assigned at birth. About a third (34%) say someone can be a man or woman, even if that differs from their sex at birth.\n\nNearly all Trump supporters (90%) say gender is determined by sex at birth. By contrast, Biden supporters are more divided. About six-in-ten (59%) say gender can be different from sex at birth; 39% say gender is determined by sex at birth.\n\nNearly a decade after the Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage, Biden and Trump supporters have starkly different views of the impact of that historic ruling. Biden supporters are about five times as likely (57%) as Trump supporters (11%) to say legalization of same-sex marriage is good for society.\n\nMost Trump voters now favor a \u201cnational effort to deport\u201d all those in the U.S. illegally. Opposition to allowing undocumented immigrants to stay in the country legally if they meet certain requirements has risen in recent years, driven largely by Republican and Republican-leaning registered voters.\n\nNearly two-thirds of Trump backers (63%) support a national effort to deport all those in the country illegally, compared with just 11% of Biden supporters.\n\nDivided views of the criminal justice system. A majority of voters (61%) say the criminal justice system is generally \u201cnot tough enough on criminals.\u201d Just 13% say the system is too tough, while 25% say it treats criminals about right.\n\nTrump supporters (81%) are about twice as likely as Biden supporters (40%) to say the criminal justice system is not tough enough on criminals.\n\nYet, there are much narrower differences in several priorities for the police and law enforcement: Overwhelming majorities of Biden and Trump supporters say it is extremely or very important for police and law enforcement to keep communities safe and to treat people of all racial and ethnic groups equally.\n\nThe changing American family. The structure of American family is very different than it was 40 or 50 years ago. Biden and Trump supporters view these changes very differently:\n\nRoughly three times as many Trump supporters as Biden supporters say society is better if people prioritize marriage and family (59% vs. 19%).\n\nAnd Trump supporters are far more likely to take a negative view of the nation\u2019s falling birth rate: 47% say people having fewer children is a bad thing, compared with 23% of Biden supporters.\n\nDivisions on abortion, more agreement on availability of contraceptives. Since the Supreme Court\u2019s 2022 decision overturning Roe v. Wade, which guaranteed a right to abortion, support for legal abortion has ticked up in both parties.\n\nToday, 88% of Biden supporters say abortion should be legal in all or most cases; 38% of Trump supporters say the same.\n\nBy contrast, voters \u2013 including large majorities of both candidates\u2019 supporters \u2013 overwhelmingly say the wide availability of birth control pills, condoms and other forms of contraception is good for society.\n\nBroad support among voters for discussing America\u2019s historical successes \u2013 and its flaws. The survey finds that while Biden and Trump supporters have profoundly different attitudes on many cultural issues, they mostly support the discussion of America\u2019s historical successes, as well as its flaws.\n\nNearly identical shares of Biden (74%) and Trump supporters (71%) say it is extremely or very important to have public discussions about the country\u2019s historical successes and strengths.\n\n78% of Biden supporters and 60% of Trump supporters say it is at least very important to have public discussions about the country\u2019s failures and flaws.\n\nVoters are very positive about more open discussions of mental health. More than eight-in-ten voters (87%) say that more people openly discussing mental health and well-being is good for society. This includes large majorities of both Biden (94% good thing) and Trump supporters (79%).\n\nRelated: Who do Americans feel comfortable talking to about their mental health?\n\nThere is broad skepticism about the increased use of artificial intelligence (AI) in daily life. More than half of voters (55%) say this is bad for society, while 21% see this as a good thing (24% say it is neither good nor bad). There are only modest differences in these views between Trump supporters (59% say this is bad for society) and Biden supporters (51%).\n\nRelated: Growing public concern about the role of artificial intelligence in everyday life\n\nVoters\u2019 comfort level with some common \u2013 and less common \u2013 experiences\n\nTo some extent, voters\u2019 political values are reflected in whether or not they\u2019re comfortable with fairly common experiences.\n\nA large share of voters (80%), including sizable majorities of Biden and Trump supporters, say they are comfortable with someone they don\u2019t know saying they will keep them in their prayers.\n\nMost women in opposite-sex marriages continue to take their husbands\u2019 last names when they marry. Still, three-quarters of voters say they are comfortable with women not taking their husbands names.\n\nTrump supporters are less comfortable than Biden supporters with women not taking their husbands\u2019 last names. And among men who support the former president, 44% are uncomfortable with this practice, compared with 29% of women who support Trump.\n\nThere is a wider gap between Biden and Trump voters in comfort with people speaking a language other than English in public places in their communities. More than eight-in-ten Biden supporters (83%) are comfortable hearing languages other than English, compared with a narrow majority of Trump supporters (54%).\n\nAnd, reflecting the wide divide between the two sides in opinions on transgender issues, just 20% of Trump supporters say they are comfortable with someone using \u201cthey/them\u201d instead of \u201che\u201d or \u201cshe\u201d to describe themselves. More than three times as many Biden supporters (66%) \u2013 including 79% of Biden supporters under age 50 \u2013 say they are comfortable with the use of these gender-neutral pronouns.",

        "text": "2. Immigration attitudes and the 2024 election\nVoters who are backing Joe Biden this fall and those who back Donald Trump express sharply contrasting views about immigration.\n\nIn part, this reflects long-standing gaps between Republicans and Democrats over how much of a problem illegal immigration is for the country, and recent differences in views about the situation at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nTrump and Biden supporters also diverge over the overarching question of whether the U.S. being open to people from all over the world is a core part of the nation\u2019s identity, and the degree to which they are comfortable or uncomfortable when languages other than English are spoken in public.\n\nHow should the country handle undocumented immigrants currently in the U.S.?\n\nAbout six-in-ten registered voters (59%) say that undocumented immigrants currently living in the U.S. should be allowed to stay in the country legally: 36% say they should be able to apply for citizenship, while 22% say they should be able to apply only for permanent residency.\n\nRoughly four-in-ten voters (41%) say, instead, that undocumented immigrants should not be allowed to stay in the country legally. Most of this group (37% of the overall public) says that there should be a national effort to deport those who are undocumented.\n\nVoters who support Trump and Biden are largely on different sides of this issue:\n\nRoughly six-in-ten Trump supporters (63%) say there should be a national effort to deport undocumented immigrants currently living in the U.S. Just 11% of Biden supporters hold this view.\n\nBy contrast, Biden supporters overwhelmingly (85%) say undocumented immigrants should be eligible to stay legally if certain requirements are met \u2013 including 56% who say this should include a path to applying for citizenship. About a third of Trump supporters (32%) say undocumented immigrants should be eligible for legal status, including just 15% saying there should be a way for them to apply for citizenship.\n\nChanging views on how the country should handle undocumented immigrants\n\nOver the past several years, Americans have become more likely to say that undocumented immigrants currently living in the U.S. should not be allowed to stay in the country legally.\n\nWhile a 59% majority of voters say that undocumented immigrants should be allowed to stay in the U.S. legally, this is a substantial drop compared with recent years. In June of 2020, 74% of voters said that undocumented immigrants should be allowed to stay legally.\n\nRepublican vs. Democratic voters\n\nToday, about two-thirds of Republican and Republican-leaning voters (66%) say undocumented immigrants should not be allowed to stay in the country legally. This is up from 54% in April 2021 and 42% four years ago.\n\nDemocratic voters have also become somewhat more likely to say that undocumented immigrants should not be allowed to stay legally. While just 16% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters now say this, that is up from 9% in 2020.\n\nIncreasing shares favor a national deportation effort\n\nSince 2021, the share of voters who favor a national effort by law enforcement to deport undocumented immigrants currently living in the U.S. has increased by 11 percentage points, from 26% to 37%.\n\nA majority of Republican voters (63%) now favor a national deportation effort, up from about half (49%) three years ago. About one-in-ten Democratic voters (11%) favor this, up 5 points over the same period.\n\nDemographic differences in immigration views within Biden and Trump coalitions\n\nThere are substantial demographic differences in views of immigration among Trump supporters.\n\nHispanic voters who support Donald Trump are about twice as likely as White Trump supporters to say that there should be a way for undocumented immigrants to stay in the country legally if they meet certain requirements.\n\nAnd nearly half of Hispanic Trump supporters (46%) say that America\u2019s openness to people from all over the world is essential to who we are as a nation, compared with 32% of White Trump supporters.\n\nRoughly half of Trump supporters ages 18 to 34 (51%) say there should be a way for undocumented immigrants to stay legally. In other age groups \u2013 particularly those 50 and older \u2013 smaller shares say this.\n\nAbout half of Trump supporters under 35 (49%) say America\u2019s openness to people from all over the world is essential to the national identity, compared with far smaller shares of Trump supporters in older age groups.\n\nAcross racial and ethnic groups as well as age groups, at least three-quarters of Biden supporters express attitudes supportive of immigration on both questions. However, these views are somewhat less widespread among Black Biden supporters than among Biden supporters in other racial and ethnic groups.\n\nAttitudes toward hearing other languages in public places\n\nTrump supporters\n\n74% of Hispanic Trump supporters say they are comfortable with people in their communities speaking a language other than English. A far smaller share of White Trump supporters say this (48%).\n\n69% of Trump supporters under 50 say they\u2019re comfortable hearing a language other than English in their community. That compares with 43% of Trump supporters 50 and older.\n\nBiden supporters",

Economic concerns remain central to voters in this November\u2019s anticipated rematch between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump . Wars in Gaza and Ukraine may influence enough voters in swing states to make foreign policy matter on Election Day .",
        "text": "Foreign policy concerns may affect US presidential election\n\u201cIt\u2019s the economy, stupid,\u201d is the oft-repeated reminder from the 1992 U.S. presidential election, attributed to political consultant James Carville explaining voter motivations.\n\nEconomic concerns remain central to voters in this November\u2019s anticipated rematch between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, but wars in Gaza and Ukraine may influence enough voters in swing states to make foreign policy matter on Election Day.\n\n\u201cThis is projected to be a very close election decided by an extremely small margin,\u201d said Robert Collins, professor of Urban Studies and Public Policy at Dillard University in New Orleans, Louisiana. \u201cIn close elections, the people on those margins can determine who becomes president.\u201d\n\nMassachusetts music teacher Lauri Sklar told VOA that this election feels different from others, in part because the war in Gaza is such \u201ca watershed moment\u201d for young Democrats.\n\n\u201cWhether they choose to support a third-party candidate or they refuse to vote entirely, I think there are a lot of young liberal voters who are not going to vote for Biden come November, and I\u2019m worried that might mean Trump wins,\u201d Sklar says.\n\nYoung Americans focused on Gaza\n\nA survey earlier this year by Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School of Government found that 18-to-29-year-old Americans overwhelmingly support a permanent cease-fire in Gaza.\n\nBrooklyn Birdie, a graduate student from Shreveport, Louisiana says she supported Biden in 2020 but will not in 2024.\n\n\u201cThere is no way \u2018Genocide Joe\u2019 will receive a vote from me this fall,\u201d Birdie told VOA. \u201cHe is complicit with an ongoing ethnic cleansing.\u201d\n\nThat does not mean she will vote for Trump instead.\n\n\u201cI think, as a businessman, Trump\u2019s presidency was good for the economy,\u201d she explained, \u201cbut I can\u2019t support someone with such unwavering support and allegiance toward Israel. I\u2019m considering voting for a third party, but I\u2019m not sure yet.\u201d\n\nAmerican priorities\n\nAmerica\u2019s role abroad matters to New York teacher Paige Benson, but it will not decide her vote.\n\n\u201cI value foreign policy, and I think our relationship with other countries is really important,\u201d she told VOA. \u201cBut that being said, we have so much work to do with our own country.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen it comes down to who I will vote for, it\u2019s going to be who I trust with the economy,\u201d she added. \u201cIt seems like everyone\u2019s struggling right now. I know people making six-figure salaries who are struggling. Imagine how the rest of us are doing.\u201d\n\nFlorida retiree Harvey Wasserman says he will be voting on immigration.\n\n\u201cForeign policy is important, but I wish we would stop being the world\u2019s judge and jury,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me, let\u2019s focus on home. I want to see secured borders and clear citizenship requirements. I think Trump is more likely to give us that.\u201d\n\nDecided on the margins\n\nConnecticut voter Rebecca Urrutia says because \u201cthe way we handle tensions with other countries will have a big impact for me,\u201d she is voting for Trump.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like Trump\u2019s style of communicating at all, but he\u2019s much stronger on foreign policy,\u201d she added. \u201cHe\u2019s direct and follows through on what he promises. The Biden administration, on the other hand, are so wishy-washy with their positions. There\u2019s too much at stake to be indecisive.\u201d\n\nForeign policy is also a top priority for Louisiana voter Debbie Pesses, but she is voting for Biden.\n\n\u201cIf Putin gets hold of Ukraine, none of Europe is safe,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd as much as I feel for the people of Gaza, we can\u2019t allow Hamas to threaten the only true democracy in the Middle East.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need someone calm in the White House,\u201d Pesses continued, \u201cand even though I worry about Biden\u2019s age, his temperament is much better for the job than Trump.\u201d\n\n2024 election impact\n\nIn an election that could be decided by a handful of swing states, Dillard University professor Collins says a motivating foreign policy concern such as the war in Gaza could make the difference. In Georgia, for example, Biden carried the state four years ago by fewer than 12,000 votes.\n\n\u201cThere are more than 11,000 Muslim-Americans in Atlanta, alone,\u201d Collins said. \u201cThat could determine the next president, and it doesn\u2019t even account for the non-Muslim college students who are extremely dissatisfied with how Biden has handled the conflict in Israel.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the end, I think Muslim-Americans will conclude that Biden is the lesser of two evils compared to Trump\u2019s Middle East policy,\u201d he continued, \u201cbut I think a sizable number of younger Democratic voters might be so disenchanted they\u2019ll choose not to vote. The question is will enough of them sit out to swing an election?\u201d",

        "text": "How Our Historic Election Cycle Will Impact Civil Liberties\nThis piece was originally published before Joe Biden withdrew from the 2024 presidential election and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to represent the Democratic Party. Some facts or details have been edited or added to reflect this change.\n\nWe are living through a historic election cycle in America.\n\nWhile the 2024 presidential election was initially set to be a rare presidential rematch between Joe Biden and Donald Trump, Biden\u2019s decision to end his bid for reelection just three months before the election and endorse Vice President Kamala Harris to represent the Democratic party is equally as rare. Not since 1968 \u2014 another landmark year in American politics -\u2013 has a presidential candidate withdrawn from the race.\n\nIn a race already marked by unprecedented events, the 2024 election will also have an extraordinary impact on our civil liberties and civil rights. Beyond any one issue being on the ballot this November \u2014 freedom is on the ballot in no uncertain terms\n\nWhile the ACLU does not endorse or oppose candidates for elected office, we know that a potential second Trump administration and an administration led by presumptive nominee Harris will be drastically different when it comes to our civil rights and civil liberties. A second Trump administration will be disastrous for our most fundamental rights and freedoms, while a Harris administration will bring a mix of challenges and opportunities that largely leaves these rights and freedoms intact. At the ACLU, we\u2019re prepared for either scenario. Our legal, policy, and advocacy experts have identified the constitutional challenges that each candidate will bring, and the concrete actions the ACLU will take in response.\n\nStarting next week, we will share our findings in a series of 13 memos \u2014 eight memos on a potential second Trump administration and five on a potential Harris administration \u2014 to be released through August. The memos will address a range of issues, including immigrant\u2019s rights, abortion access, LGBTQ justice, racial equity, police reform, and more.\n\nTo move the national discourse beyond agonizing over potential challenges to analyzing potential solutions, our memo series outlines not only the threats to our freedoms, but also includes comprehensive, substantive, and actionable solutions the ACLU will use to block the punches \u2014 egregious attempts to ignore the Constitution \u2014 or lessen the blows.\n\nI believe in the strength of our commitment because I've seen what our organization is capable of accomplishing when our freedom is on the line. In 2016, the ACLU was the only national organization to issue a comprehensive plan for the policies of a potential Clinton administration, but also those of a potential Trump administration. That plan laid the groundwork for us to file 434 legal actions against the Trump administration, including the first lawsuit to halt the Trump Muslim Ban within hours of its enactment.\n\nOur detailed analysis of Trump\u2019s policies foreshadowed a constitutional crisis that, nearly a decade later, continues to impact our nation as a whole. Today, our analysis once again prepares us to continue that fight, over the course of the next administration and beyond, just like we did in 2016.\n\nWhile recent events have shown that much can change between now and November, we must be prepared for the possibility that Trump may return to the White House. We know that a second Trump administration will be significantly more aggressive and effective in executing its plans to fundamentally erode our democracy, take away our freedoms, and violate our constitution.",

No significant facts have been changed or added.\n\nThe Facts: If reelected, Trump has promised to use totalitarian tactics to carry out the largest mass detention and deportation program in the nation\u2019s history. Experience from smaller-scale detention sweeps shows that his proposed policies will lead to people being stopped, arrested, or detained simply because they \u201clook foreign,\u201d and his program will necessarily entail numerous other legal violations as well. Trump and his supporters also seek to dismantle our asylum system \u2013 creating more chaos at the border \u2014 and attack families by ending birthright citizenship and depriving undocumented children of their right to a public education. Trump has also vowed to reinstate family separation at the border \u2013 a cruel policy the ACLU blocked during his presidency.\n\nWhy It Matters: While many of the immigration policies we saw during Trump\u2019s presidency were halted or delayed through litigation, the immigration policies we\u2019ll likely see during a second Trump administration are far crueler, more extreme, and more fundamentally damaging to core rights and freedoms than any in living memory. If Trump is reelected, his plan to deport millions of people a year and severely restrict legal immigration will violate key legal protections \u2013 including our right to due process \u2013 and make xenophobia and racism the touchstones of American immigration policy. Simply put, these policies would harm all of us by tearing apart immigrant families, communities, and the fabric of American society.\n\nHow We Got Here: There\u2019s no doubt that a second Trump administration will pick up and expand the anti-immigrant campaign it began in 2016. During his first term, the Trump administration instituted a Muslim ban, tried to deport Dreamers and others with temporary legal protection, separated families seeking asylum, and fought to build a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nOur Roadmap: Through coordinated action at all levels and branches of government, we\u2019re prepared to fight the Trump administration\u2019s attack on immigrant rights. We\u2019ll call on legislators to prevent Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from conducting mass deportations and pass measures to begin shrinking the ICE detention machine. We\u2019ll also work with states and localities to build a civil rights firewall to protect residents to the full extent possible and ensure that a Trump administration can\u2019t hijack state resources to carry out its draconian policies. And, if Trump sends a bill to Congress that effectively ends asylum, we\u2019re prepared to mobilize our supporters nationwide to stop it because we know that a strong majority of voters support the U.S. asylum system.\n\nIn addition to working for policy change at every government level, we\u2019re prepared to litigate cases to protect people\u2019s rights under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, as well as other legal provisions, against the mass deportation program. We\u2019ll use the full power of the Fourteenth Amendment and Supreme Court precedent to protect birthright citizenship and ensure immigrant children have equal access to education. Lastly, should a second Trump administration try to bring back family separation at the border, we\u2019ll take them to court for violating our settlement agreement.\n\nWhat Our Experts Say: \u201cThese policies have no place in a democracy that protects or respects civil liberties and the rule of law. From the courts to the halls of Congress, we will use every tool at our disposal, including litigation, to defend the rights of immigrants and protect all members of our communities from the widespread damage these policies would cause.\u201d \u2013 Omar Jadwat, director of the ACLU\u2019s Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project\n\n\u201cXenophobia and racism would become the touchstones of American immigration policy under a second Trump administration, if he is re-elected. That\u2019s why we must begin mobilizing with local and state governments now to protect communities nationwide from extreme anti-immigrant policies.\u201d \u2013 Naureen Shah, deputy director of government affairs at the ACLU\n\nWhat You Can Do Today: ICE detention is known for abuse, pervasive medical neglect, and complete disregard for the dignity of people in its custody. Needlessly locking up people seeking a better life does nothing to make our communities safer. Take action now: Tell your congress member to support cuts for ICE detention capacity.",

        "text": "Election certification disputes in a handful of states spark concerns over 2024 presidential contest\nIn Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula, two Republican members of a county canvassing board last month refused to sign off on the results of an election that led to the recall of three GOP members of the county commission. They did so only after state officials warned them it was their legal duty to record the final vote tally.\n\nIn Georgia\u2019s Fulton County, which includes the Democratic-voting city of Atlanta, a group run by members of former President Donald Trump\u2019s administration last month sued so a Republican member of the local elections board could refuse to certify the results of the primary election.\n\nAnd in Arizona, GOP lawmakers sued to reverse the state\u2019s top Democratic officials\u2019 requirement that local boards automatically validate their election results.\n\nThe past four years have been filled with battles over all sorts of election arcana, including one that had long been regarded as an administrative afterthought \u2014 little-known state and local boards certifying the results. With the presidential election looming in November, attorneys are gearing up for yet more fights over election certification, especially in the swing states where the victory margins are expected to be tight. Even if those efforts ultimately fail, election officials worry they\u2019ll become a vehicle for promoting bogus election claims.\n\nTrump and his allies have tried to use the tactic to stop election results from being made final if they lose. In 2020, two Republicans on Michigan\u2019s state board of canvassers, which must certify ballot totals before state officials can declare a winner, briefly balked at signing off before one relented and became the decisive vote. Trump had cheered the delay as part of his push to overturn his loss that ultimately culminated in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\nDuring the 2022 midterms, some conservative, rural counties tried to hold up their state election results, citing the same debunked claims of voter fraud that Trump has made.\n\nWhat to know about Trump\u2019s second term:\n\nStaffing the administration: Here are the people Trump has picked recess appointments Follow all of our coverage as Donald Trump assembles his second administration.\n\nIn New Mexico, rural county supervisors refused to certify the state\u2019s primary vote until they were threatened with prosecution. In Cochise County in southeastern Arizona, two Republican supervisors who refused to certify the local vote totals said they had no doubt their own county\u2019s tally was accurate but were protesting the counts in other counties that gave Democratic candidates for governor, attorney general and secretary of state their victories.\n\nResponding to the certification controversies, Michigan\u2019s Democratic legislature passed a law making clear that state and local canvassing boards must certify election totals. The two Arizona county supervisors are currently facing criminal charges filed by the state\u2019s Democratic attorney general.\n\nDemocrats and nonpartisan groups say the thousands of local election oversight boards across the country aren\u2019t the place to contest ballot counts, and that state laws make clear they have no leeway on whether to sign off on their staff\u2019s final tallies.\n\n\u201cElection authorities don\u2019t have the discretion to reject the results of an election because of their vibes,\u201d said Jonathan Diaz of the Campaign Legal Center, adding that lawsuits and recounts are the proper recourse. \u201cThey\u2019re there to perform a function. They\u2019re there to certify.\u201d\n\nBut some Republicans argue that\u2019s going too far. Kory Langhofer, the attorney suing to overturn the election procedures manual\u2019s directive in Arizona that was issued by the Democratic attorney general and secretary of state, said he didn\u2019t support the effort to block certification in Cochise County in 2022. But, he argued, locally elected boards of supervisors have to have some discretion to police elections.\n\n\u201cIt seems to me the system is stronger when you have multiple eyes on it,\u201d Langhofer said. Of the efforts to block certification in 2020 and 2022, he added, \u201cI hope that\u2019s behind us.\u201d\n\nDemocrats doubt that\u2019s the case. They note that the America First Policy Institute, a pro-Trump organization run by former officials from his administration, filed the lawsuit in Georgia to let Fulton County Elections Board member Julie Adams vote against certifying elections. Adams\u2019 four other board members voted to certify last month\u2019s primary but Adams abstained last week, contending she couldn\u2019t accept the results given prior election administration problems in the county.\n\n\u201cThis action will re-establish the role of board members as the ultimate parties responsible for ensuring elections in Fulton County are free from fraud, deceit, and abuse,\u201d the institute wrote in its release announcing the lawsuit. The group did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nFulton County is the heart of the Democratic vote in Georgia, and anything that holds up its totals in November could help make it look like Trump has a large lead in the state.\n\n\u201cTrump and MAGA Republicans have made it clear they are planning to try to block certification of November\u2019s election when they are defeated again, and this is a transparent attempt to set the stage for that fight,\u201d Georgia Democratic Party chair and Rep. Nikema Williams said in a statement.\n\nIn Michigan\u2019s Delta County, clerk Nancy Przewrocki, a Republican, said the two GOP canvassers had requested a hand recount of the votes, which is beyond the scope of their position. The canvassers eventually voted to certify the May election after receiving a letter from the State Elections Director Jonathan Brater, which reminded them of their duties and warned them of the consequences of failing to certify.\n\nStill, Przewrocki said she\u2019s concerned about what could happen in November if a similar situation arises.\n\n\u201cI can see this escalating, unfortunately. I\u2019m trying to keep our voters confident in our voting equipment, and this is completely undermining it when there\u2019s really nothing there,\u201d Przewrocki said.\n\nFollowing the Delta County incident, Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson and Attorney General Dana Nessel, both Democrats, issued a reminder to local canvassing boards throughout the state warning them of their legal obligation to certify election results based solely on vote returns. If they don\u2019t, there will be \u201cswift action to ensure the legal certification of election results,\u201d along with \u201cpossible civil and criminal charges against those members for their actions,\u201d Benson warned.\n\nMichigan is an example of the futility of the tactic. The new state law makes it clear that canvassing boards can\u2019t block certification, but Benson said in an interview that she still worries such an effort, even if legally doomed, would help spread false allegations about the November election.\n\n\u201cMisinformation and talking points emerge that enable others \u2014 particularly politicians \u2014 to continue to cast doubt on the accuracy of election results,\u201d she said.\n\n___\n\nRiccardi reported from Denver and Cappelletti from Lansing, Michigan. Associated Press writers Jeff Amy in Atlanta and Morgan Lee in Santa Fe, New Mexico, contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow the AP\u2019s coverage of the 2024 election at https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024.",

The hallmarks are consistent: attempting to erode support for Ukraine, discrediting democratic institutions and officials .",
        "text": "This is what Russian propaganda looks like in 2024\nThis is what Russian propaganda looks like in 2024\n\ntoggle caption Olga Maltseva/AFP via Getty Images\n\nA deepfake video of a State Department official falsely claiming a Russian city is a legitimate target for Ukrainian strikes using U.S. weapons.\n\nPro-Russia social media accounts amplifying stories about divisive political topics such as immigration and campus protests over the war in Gaza.\n\nSham news sites spoofing real publications or posing as legitimate-sounding outlets with names like D.C. Weekly, the Boston Times and Election Watch.\n\nRussian propaganda is ramping up in a busy global election year, targeting American voters as well as elections in Europe and the Paris Olympics, according to intelligence officials, internet researchers and tech companies.\n\n\u201cRussia remains the most active foreign threat to our elections,\u201d Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines told senators last month at a briefing about election risks.\n\nInfluence operations linked to Russia take aim at a disparate range of targets and subjects around the world. But their hallmarks are consistent: attempting to erode support for Ukraine, discrediting democratic institutions and officials, seizing on existing political divides and harnessing new artificial intelligence tools.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"They're often producing narratives that feel like they're throwing spaghetti at a wall,\" said Andy Carvin, managing editor at the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab, which tracks online information operations. \"If they can get more people on the internet arguing with each other or trusting each other less, then in some ways their job is done.\"\n\nSome efforts have been linked directly to the Kremlin, including a network of fake accounts and phony news websites given the name Doppelganger, whose operators have been sanctioned by both the U.S. and the European Union.\n\nThe origins of others are still unknown, such as the fabricated video of State Department spokesman Matthew Miller, in which reporters' questions and Miller's response about U.S. policy in the Ukraine war were faked, likely with the help of artificial intelligence. The video circulated on Russian Telegram channels and was picked up by Russian state media and government officials, according to The New York Times.\n\nRussia employed tactics such as exacerbating existing divisive issues and creating fake accounts posing as Americans in its 2016 and 2020 election-meddling efforts, researchers say. Since Russia invaded Ukraine in early 2022, discrediting Ukraine and amplifying voices in the U.S. and other countries that oppose aid to Ukraine and support for NATO has become a dominant theme of the Kremlin's efforts.\n\n\"What you can see is they are referencing politics in a certain country, and they are generally tying that to what is going on in Ukraine. The underlying message is, 'Here's why people should not support Ukraine,'\" said Ben Nimmo, principal investigator on OpenAI\u2019s intelligence and investigations team, who previously led global threat intelligence at Facebook's owner, Meta.\n\n\n\nFake accounts, phony websites\n\nThe Kremlin relies on what Haines called \"a vast multimedia influence apparatus, which consists of its intelligence services, cyber-actors, state media proxies and social media trolls\" to pump out propaganda, launder fake and misleading news articles and circulate conspiracy theories.\n\nSince the invasion of Ukraine, the European Union has banned Russian media outlets including RT, Sputnik, Voice of Europe and RIA Novosti from publishing or broadcasting within the bloc. That hasn\u2019t stopped RT articles from proliferating across hundreds of other websites widely available in Europe, according to a recent report from the German Marshall Fund of the United States, the University of Amsterdam and the Institute for Strategic Dialogue.\n\n\"We discovered RT articles reposted to third-party websites targeting audiences from Iraq to Ethiopia to New Zealand, often without any indication that the content was sourced from a Russian propaganda outlet,\" the researchers wrote.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nPerhaps the most persistent and prevalent Russian online operation is Doppelganger. First identified by researchers at the EU DisinfoLab in 2022, the campaign has impersonated news outlets including the U.K.'s The Guardian, Germany's Der Spiegel, The Washington Post and Fox News, and it has posed as NATO, the Polish and Ukrainian governments, the German police and the French Foreign Ministry.\n\nIn addition to operating fake accounts and phony websites, the operation purchased Facebook ads targeting French and German audiences with messages about aid to Ukraine, farmers' protests and the war in Gaza, according to the European nonprofit AI Forensics.\n\nDoppelganger has also set its sights on the Paris Olympics, Microsoft said in a report this week. It used fake French-language news sites to push claims of corruption in the Games' organizing body and to warn of potential violence.\n\nIn March, the U.S. Treasury sanctioned two Russian companies identified as being behind Doppelganger \u2014 Social Design Agency and Structura \u2014 as well as their founders, saying they carried out the campaign \"at the direction of the Russian Presidential Administration.\"\n\nThe misinformation-tracking company NewsGuard has connected a separate network of 167 websites \"masquerading as independent local news publishers in the U.S.\" to a former deputy sheriff from Florida who now lives in Moscow.\n\n\n\nUsing AI tools to create propaganda\n\nThe volume of posts, articles and websites that Russian-linked operations produce is being boosted by artificial intelligence \u2014 another new factor that sets 2024 apart from previous election cycles.\n\nCovert influence campaigns based in Russia, as well as in China, Iran and Israel, have begun using AI in their attempts to manipulate public opinion and shape politics, according to recent reports from OpenAI, Meta and Microsoft.\n\nA Russian operation that Microsoft calls Storm-1679 used AI to fake actor Tom Cruise's voice narrating a phony Netflix documentary disparaging the International Olympic Committee.\n\nAccording to OpenAI, Doppelganger has used its AI tools, which include ChatGPT, to translate articles into other languages and generate social media posts and comments. Another Russian operation, dubbed Bad Grammar, used AI to debug code for a program that automatically posted on Telegram.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe question remains: How effective are Russia's attempts to influence public opinion and democratic elections?\n\nMany online operations that have been publicly identified haven't reached large audiences of real people, researchers say, and AI hasn't made them any more convincing \u2014 at least not yet.\n\n\"It's absolutely true that when you look at an individual campaign, it's just as likely as not that it hasn't had a huge amount of influence, which is why Russia just does it again and again, or in a different form, or targeting a different group,\" the Digital Forensic Research Lab's Carvin said. \"It's almost like producing cheaply manufactured goods and just getting it out there in the world, hoping that maybe one particular gadget ends up becoming the popular toy of the season, even if the others completely fail.\"\n\nMany researchers who study disinformation warn against seeing the hand of Russia as an all-powerful puppeteer, especially since so much of what its mouthpieces amplify is homegrown.\n\n\"Any potential narrative that's being argued in a given political environment is fodder for Russian operations \u2014 which in itself can sound a little crazy and conspiracy-ish,\" Carvin said. \"And in some ways you risk creating a \u2026 situation where absolutely everything that's happening online is all Russia's fault.\"\n\nBut, he added, \"at the same time, Russia has a lot of resources at its disposal and it's willing to experiment in different ways to see which things stick. \u2026 Why not try all of the above and see where it takes you?\"",

Beijing fiercely criticized Lai\u2019s inaugural address and conducted military drills and patrols around Taiwan in a bid to \u201cpunish\u201d Lai for failing to heed China\u2019s preferred positions. In the days following the speech, Lai also faced challenges at home, as opposition parties in Taiwan\u2019s legislature passed a set of reform bills that critics warn could increase China\u2019s ability to interfere in Taiwan\u2019s domestic affairs.\n\nTaiwan\u2019s new president, William Lai Ching-te, center, during a rally in Taipei, Taiwan, on Jan 13, 2024. (Lam Yik Fei/The New York Times)\n\nAll signs point to increasing cross-Strait tensions over the next four years as Taipei and Beijing test each other\u2019s limits and seek to advance their political objectives. Lai Signals a Tougher Approach on China Lai, who was vice president under previous president Tsai Ing-wen, aimed to reassure Taiwan voters that his administration would have continuity with his predecessor\u2019s approach to domestic issues such as economic development and energy policy, as well as foreign policy. On cross-Strait relations, however, Lai made three key points that demonstrated a relatively tougher stance on China, surprising some in Beijing. First, Lai pledged to stand firm on Taiwan's sovereignty. Lai used the word \u201csovereignty\u201d seven times during his speech, a significant increase over Tsai's single mention of the word in her 2016 inaugural address and its total absence from her 2020 speech. Lai also referenced \u201cTaiwan\u201d 82 times, far exceeding Tsai's 41 mentions in her 2016 speech and 47 uses in 2020. While many use the terms Taiwan and Republic of China interchangeably, calling the island \u201cTaiwan\u201d suggests that it is a separate entity from China. The Republic of China, or ROC, is the official name and more palatable to Beijing. And while Tsai used diplomatic terms like \u201cthe other side of the Strait\u201d or \u201cBeijing authorities\u201d in her inaugural speech, Lai directly mentioned \u201cChina\u201d seven times, clearly distinguishing Taiwan from China. Second, Lai\u2019s speech adopted a stronger and more assertive position toward Beijing. Although Lai\u2019s cross-Strait approach seems largely aligned with Tsai\u2019s broad direction on the surface, subtle differences lie in the finer details. He endorsed Tsai\u2019s \u201cFour Commitments\u201d but specifically only elaborated on the one that Taiwan and China are not subordinate to each other. Lai also condemned China\u2019s military threat in a more straightforward and assertive way than Tsia ever did. He called China\u2019s military actions and gray-zone coercion \u201cthe greatest strategic challenges to global peace and stability,\u201d and emphasized that \u201cChina\u2019s ambition to annex Taiwan will not simply disappear.\u201d Third, \u201cdemocracy\u201d was a prominent theme throughout Lai's speech. Lai positioned democratic Taiwan as a beacon of global peace and a driver of global prosperity. By placing Taiwan in the pantheon of the world's democratic nations, Lai was likely hoping to build international support for Taiwan\u2019s political system, boost Taiwan\u2019s status on the global stage, and further distance Taiwan from Beijing. Lai sent a clear signal to Beijing that he would not back down in the face of pressure. Still, his speech reflected a degree of restraint. The new president\u2019s team knew that China would object to any speech that did not explicitly accept the 1992 Consensus \u2014 a vague agreement reached in the early 1990s that stipulates that both sides of the Taiwan Strait belong to \u201cone China\u201d \u2014 which Lai would not do. Instead, he mixed tough words with subtle olive branches to Beijing, such as mentioning the historical figure Chiang Wei-shui, who is deemed acceptable on both sides of the Strait. He also used the term ROC 15 times, which was more than Tsai did in 2016 or 2020. In Beijing\u2019s eyes, however, the limited conciliatory language in the speech was not enough to counterbalance Lai\u2019s harsher rhetoric.\n\nLai sent a clear signal to Beijing that he would not back down in the face of pressure. Still, his speech reflected a degree of restraint.\n\nChina Pushes Back No matter what Lai might have said in his speech, Beijing\u2019s opposition to the address was a foregone conclusion. But Lai\u2019s stance on cross-Strait relations and Taiwan\u2019s sovereignty further intensified Beijing's displeasure. Since Lai was nominated as the DPP\u2019s presidential candidate in April 2023, Beijing has consistently accused him of being a \u201cstubborn Taiwan independence worker\u201d and \u201cdestroyer of cross-Strait peace.\u201d Indeed, Beijing\u2019s rhetorical response was swift and harsh. Just hours after the speech, China\u2019s Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO) issued a short statement accusing Lai of \u201cvigorously promoting the separatism fallacies\u201d and \u201cinciting cross-Strait confrontation,\u201d echoing previous criticisms. The following day, the TAO gave a comprehensive response to Lai\u2019s speech, characterizing it as a complete \u201cconfession of Taiwan independence.\u201d The statement accused Taiwan\u2019s leader of promptly \u201crevealing the true face of \u2018Taiwan independence\u2019 upon taking office.\u201d China\u2019s foreign minister, Wang Yi, said that \u201call Taiwan independence separatists will be nailed to the pillar of shame in history.\u201d On May 29, during the TAO\u2019s first press conference after the speech, a spokesperson further criticized the speech for filling with lies and deceit, distorting history, and promoting Taiwan independence under the guise of \u201cdemocracy.\u201d On May 21, the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s official People's Daily newspaper dedicated its entire fourth page to strongly refuting Lai's approach to cross-Strait affairs. A commentary titled \u201cTaiwan independence worker\u2019s empty rhetoric harms Taiwan\u201d accused Lai of deceitfully promoting a \u201ctwo-state theory\u201d and exacerbating cross-Strait tensions. Mainland academics described the speech as sending a \u201cvery intense\u201d signal to Beijing with its \u201cpro-independence\u201d language. Zhou Zhihuai, former director of the Institute of Taiwan at the Chinese Academy of Social Science, said Lai\u2019s was the \u201cmost pro-independence speech\u201d ever given by a Taiwanese leader. China also used its military to intimidate Taiwan after the speech. On May 23, China conducted two days of military exercises that encircled Taiwan. A spokesperson for the Chinese military\u2019s Eastern Theater Command, which is responsible for the drills and a potential Taiwan contingency, called the exercise \u201ca strong punishment for the separatist acts of Taiwan independence forces and a serious warning against interference and provocation by external forces.\u201d The duration and scale of China\u2019s military drills were smaller than those conducted in August 2022 after then-House Speaker Pelosi visited Taipei and in April 2023 after Tsai transited through California. Yet a Taiwanese military expert noted that unlike previous exercises, these drills simulated a \u201cfull-scale armed invasion of Taiwan,\u201d encompassed Taiwan's outlying islands for the first time, and were conducted at the edge of the 24 nautical miles of Taiwan's contiguous zone. Beijing continued its military pressure and intimidation campaign on May 28, by conducting \u201cjoint combat readiness patrols\u201d in the air and waters around Taiwan. China has also used economic tools to express its displeasure. On May 20, the Ministry of Commerce added three U.S. companies to its \u201cunreliable entities\u201d list for their involvement in arms sales to Taiwan. The next day China sent a clear signal that it was also not satisfied with Washington\u2019s posture on Taiwan, issuing sanctions on former U.S. congressman Mike Gallagher, who chaired the U.S. House of Representatives\u2019 Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, for his \u201cinterference in China's internal affairs, undermining China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and infringing on China's interests.\u201d And last week, China\u2019s State Council announced the suspension of preferential tariff arrangements on 134 items under the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement, a cross-Strait trade agreement signed in 2010. Although China\u2019s response to Lai\u2019s speech has been strong, it has also been carefully calibrated not to provoke the United States, as Beijing does not want to make the cross-Strait issue a major area of focus in the U.S. presidential campaign.\n\nThe continued harassment is all part of Beijing\u2019s broader effort to redefine a \u201cnew normal\u201d of heightened military pressure on Taiwan.\n\nThe continued harassment is all part of Beijing\u2019s broader effort to redefine a \u201cnew normal\u201d of heightened military pressure on Taiwan. These actions, coupled with additional diplomatic, economic and military gray-zone coercion, are intended to undermine the Lai administration\u2019s legitimacy and ability to govern. Indeed, Lai is already experiencing challenges from Taiwan\u2019s legislature, where opposition parties rapidly approved several bills that will greatly expand the legislature\u2019s power, citing the goal of improving institutional checks and balances. Critics are primarily concerned about the swift and forceful push to pass the bills without considering public feedback on the details. Some also called the measures \u201cpro-China\u201d and warned that they would make it easier for Beijing to interfere in Taiwan\u2019s domestic affairs and weaken civil society. Tens of thousands of people are protesting the bills outside the legislature building, and this new \u201cBluebird Movement,\u201d now a highly partisan issue in Taiwan, could signal the potential for discord in the divided government ahead. The Risk of Unwanted Conflict Remains Over the next four years, Taipei and Beijing will likely continue to probe each other's implicit boundaries, seeking opportunities to advance their political agendas and shift political narratives and conventional wisdom in the region and around the world. Taiwan\u2019s leaders will work to further strengthen the island democracy\u2019s distinct political identity, while Beijing will use a combination of carrots and sticks to encourage Taiwan voters to seek peaceful unification on Beijing\u2019s terms. While this tension may remain restrained until the U.S. presidential election, it will likely escalate in 2025. As tensions rise, so does the risk of unwanted conflict. Improved communication between Washington and Beijing, and between Beijing and Taipei, will be critical for ensuring that all parties are sending clear signals and correctly interpreting the messages sent by others.\n\nImproved communication between Washington and Beijing, and between Beijing and Taipei, will be critical for ensuring that all parties are sending clear signals and correctly interpreting the messages sent by others.\n\nThe U.S. Congress will continue to play a key role in U.S. policy toward Taiwan and cross-Strait relations more broadly. Lai\u2019s speech made only one direct mention of the United States, and that was a reference to the Indo-Pacific Security Supplemental Appropriations Act, which provided support to Taiwan. A week after Lai\u2019s inauguration, two bipartisan House and Senate delegations traveled to Taipei to demonstrate U.S. support for the new government. Given Lai\u2019s tougher line on China and Beijing\u2019s unyielding position on Taiwan, it\u2019s unlikely that cross-Strait relations will improve or that tensions will lower anytime soon. Even as Washington is occupied with the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, it should remain laser-focused on helping Taiwan defend itself and deter military conflict. Conflict in the Taiwan Strait is neither imminent nor inevitable, but all sides \u2014 Taipei, Beijing and Washington \u2014 must work to keep the peace in what is one of the world\u2019s most dangerous flashpoints for great power conflict.\n\nPHOTO: Taiwan\u2019s new president, William Lai Ching-te, center, during a rally in Taipei, Taiwan, on Jan 13, 2024.

        "text": "How will Biden\u2019s new restrictions affect asylum seekers at US border?\nAl Jazeera breaks down the latest effort to curb southern border crossings, and what risks they pose.\n\nUnited States President Joe Biden has unveiled a sweeping executive order restricting asylum claims, expanding controversial efforts to curb the surging number of people crossing the country\u2019s southern border.\n\nThat order went into effect on Wednesday. It comes as Biden is expected to face a reckoning on immigration issues in November\u2019s presidential election, where he is set to face Republican challenger and former President Donald Trump.\n\nBiden, who entered office pledging to reverse Trump\u2019s hardline border policies, has said the new order is essential to rebooting the US asylum system.\n\nIt gives his administration the authority to stop processing asylum claims if the number of irregular crossings at the US-Mexico border surpasses an average of 2,500 per day for a week.\n\nBut migrant rights groups have roundly condemned the president\u2019s proclamation, with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) saying the order will stifle the legal right to claim asylum, thus \u201cputting tens of thousands of lives at risk\u201d.\n\nHere\u2019s what to know about the latest restrictions.\n\nWhat is asylum?\n\nAsylum is a principle under international law that allows individuals to seek protection when fleeing from war, persecution and human rights violations in their home countries.\n\nUnder US immigration law, any non-citizens on US soil must be granted due process to seek asylum if they fear for their lives or freedom \u201con account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion\u201d.\n\nWhy is Biden seeking to restrict asylum?\n\nBecause of the often life-or-death stakes, the law allows persecuted individuals to apply for asylum in the US regardless of how they arrived in the country. That includes crossing the border irregularly.\n\nBut critics, including the Biden administration, have said the existing system \u2014 and its massive backlog \u2014 offer an incentive for those who are not eligible to cross the border and file an application anyway.\n\nThat, in theory, allows them to stay in the country while their application is reviewed, a process that can take months if not years in some cases. They cannot be removed if there is a significant chance they could be eligible.\n\nMigrant rights groups, however, have said that any move to block individuals from seeking asylum falls short of the US government\u2019s legal and moral obligations.\n\nThey also warn that barriers to making asylum claims could force applicants to return to life-threatening situations \u2014 or leave them vulnerable to exploitation by criminal gangs along the border.\n\nWhat does the new order do?\n\nBiden\u2019s executive order puts a cap on the number of asylum seekers who can enter the US via the southern border in a given time period.\n\nThe ability to apply for asylum after irregularly crossing the border will be largely suspended when detainments at and near the border exceed a daily average of 2,500 across the span of a week.\n\nThat pause will continue until the secretary of the US Department of Homeland Security \u201cmakes a factual determination\u201d that those numbers have fallen to an average of 1,500 daily encounters over a period of a week.\n\nThen, 14 days afterwards, the normal asylum processes will resume.\n\nAre there exceptions?\n\nUnder the executive order, there are several exceptions to the suspension of asylum-related entries.\n\nIndividuals crossing the border who express fear of persecution if they are returned to their home countries will still be screened by asylum officers \u2014 but in an expedited process with a higher standard than those currently in place.\n\nIndividuals deemed \u201cparticularly vulnerable\u201d could still be allowed to stay in the US to seek other forms of humanitarian protection, according to the White House.\n\nThe order exempts unaccompanied minors and human-trafficking victims, as well as those who have appointments to make an asylum claim via the CBP One app.\n\nWhen does the order go into effect?\n\nThe order went into effect at the start of June 5. However, the real effects on the ground will be contingent on the number of crossings in the coming days and weeks.\n\nThe pause would go into effect as soon as the Department of Homeland Security determines there have been seven consecutive days exceeding the 2,500 encounter limit.\n\nDaily encounters on the southern land border in May hovered around 3,700 a day, according to numbers obtained by CBS News. As the Associated Press news agency reported, the last time the number of encounters dipped below 2,500 was in January 2021.\n\nAt the current rate, restrictions could go into effect by next week.\n\nWhat does this mean for migrants and asylum seekers?\n\nBiden\u2019s proclamation could have several knock-on effects, according to rights groups.\n\nMost pressingly, they warn the executive order risks denying asylum to those who actually need it.\n\nRights groups have also expressed concerns that such restrictions encourage migrants and asylum seekers to take more dangerous routes into the country, in order to avoid border authorities.\n\nThe move is also set to further delay scheduling for asylum appointments through the CBP One app, which can leave people waiting in dangerous conditions across the border in Mexico.\n\nHow might removals happen?\n\nIn May of last year, the Biden administration ended its use of Title 42, a measure enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic to give officials the permission to eject \u2014 but not formally deport \u2014 people detained at the border without allowing them to seek asylum first.\n\nThose ejected could attempt to seek asylum in the US at a future date.\n\nSince then, officials have relied on Title 8, part of the US code governing immigration and nationality that includes formal deportation procedures.\n\nUnder that authority, deported migrants and asylum seekers could face a ban on re-entering the US for five years, according to the Department of Homeland Security. Attempting to return after deportation could also result in criminal penalties.\n\nMigration advocates fear those penalties await people who cross irregularly during the new asylum suspensions. Homeland Security has indicated those who do not meet the \u201ccredible fear\u201d standards used to evaluate asylum claims will be actively removed.\n\nWhy are restrictions being compared to those imposed under Trump?\n\nBiden\u2019s executive order relies on the same law used by former President Trump in some of his most controversial immigration policies: Section 212(f) of the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act.\n\nThe provision allows the president to \u201csuspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens\u201d when it is determined their arrival \u201cwould be detrimental to the interests of the United States\u201d.\n\nIt also permits the president to impose \u201cany restrictions he may deem to be appropriate\u201d to limit entry to those groups.\n\nTrump cited the law as justification for a 2018 policy that effectively banned people who irregularly crossed the southern border from seeking asylum. A federal judge later blocked the policy.\n\nIn 2017, Trump also relied on the law to implement what critics called a \u201cMuslim ban\u201d, blocking travellers and refugees from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the US.\n\nWhat questions remain?\n\nMost significantly, it remains unclear what will happen to migrants and asylum seekers who arrive irregularly in the US when a suspension is in place under the new policy.\n\nSeveral administration officials told the Associated Press there was not adequate funding for an increase in deportations.\n\nThe US currently has an agreement with Mexico to accept up to 30,000 citizens a month from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela denied entry to the US.\n\nBut expulsions and deportations to Mexico could exceed that amount, and how authorities plan to deal with nationals from other countries remains unknown.\n\nWill the new restrictions stand?\n\nLawyers for the ACLU have already vowed to challenge Biden\u2019s policy in court, as they did with similar policies enacted under Trump.\n\nIn a post on the social media platform X, the organisation said Biden\u2019s executive action \u201ctakes the same approach as the Trump administration\u2019s asylum ban\u201d, which it successfully blocked.\n\nWhat has the reaction in Washington been?\n\nGiven the legally precarious nature of the policy, even those who have called for more restrictions at the border, including Republican Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, have dismissed Biden\u2019s effort as an empty political manoeuvre ahead of the 2024 presidential election.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s window dressing,\u201d Johnson said on Tuesday. \u201cEveryone knows that, if he was concerned about the border, he would have done this a long time ago.\u201d\n\nBiden, however, has blamed Republicans in Congress for failing to pass \u201cmeaningful policy reforms\u201d, thereby forcing his hand.\n\nEfforts to pass an immigration bill that would have likewise overhauled the asylum system stalled in February and again in May, with Republicans in the House of Representatives warning it would be \u201cdead on arrival\u201d in their chamber.",

Credit: GETTY IMAGES overdose prevention One-third of US Adults Know Someone Who Died from Drug Overdose A new study found that this personal loss to overdose spanned political parties and income levels, and that bereaved individuals are more likely to view addiction as a top policy priority.\n\nMore Americans between the ages of 18 to 45 die from opioid overdose than from any other cause, leading to a near-record high of 108,000 US drug overdose deaths in 2023.\n\nEmerging from this persistent, nationwide crisis is another staggering statistic: 32 percent of American adults\u201482.7 million individuals\u2014know someone who has died of a drug overdose, according to a new study by researchers at Boston University School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, the University of Minnesota School of Public Health, and the de Beaumont Foundation.\n\nPublished in JAMA Health Forum, the study also found that for nearly 20 percent of US adults, or 48.9 million people, the person they lost to overdose was a family member or close friend.\n\nOverdose loss was largely consistent across political parties, and people who experienced this loss were 37 percent more likely to view addiction as an important or very important policy issue, signaling that addiction is a bipartisan issue that could motivate voters ahead of the US presidential election this fall.\n\nThese findings capture the profound scope of the opioid epidemic and its impact on the people left mourning the loss of overdose victims, including family members, friends, acquaintances, coworkers, classmates, and many more. These bereaved groups are often overlooked in research and in public discourse, but their collective experiences and concern about this crisis reflect the potential for them to unify and advocate for effective policy change on this issue at all levels of government.\n\n\u201cThe opioid epidemic has been truly devastating in this country, accelerated by the COVID-19 moment,\u201d says study senior author Sandro Galea, SPH dean and Robert A. Knox Professor. \u201cRecognizing how close this epidemic is to all of us can\u2014should\u2014catalyze action to help mitigate it.\u201d\n\nThe analysis was led by Alene Kennedy-Hendricks, assistant professor in the Department of Health Policy and Management at the Bloomberg School.\n\nFor the study, the team utilized data from a nationally representative survey of 2,326 US adults ages 18 and older, conducted in spring 2023. The survey was part of the fourth wave of the COVID-19 and Life Stressors Impact on Mental Health and Well-Being (CLIMB) study, an annual study launched in March 2020 by the Rockefeller Foundation-Boston University 3-D Commission and the de Beaumont Foundation to measure trends in mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Led by Catherine Ettman, former chief of staff and director of strategic initiatives in the Office of the Dean at SPH and currently an assistant professor in the Department of Health Policy and Management at the Bloomberg School, the latest survey in the CLIMB Study aimed to assess the magnitude of losing a loved one to overdose, and the policy implications of this collective and widespread grief.\n\nAmong self-identified Democrat, Republican, and Independent participants, there was little difference in the prevalence of reported overdose loss, occurring among 29 percent, 33 percent, and 34 percent of participants, respectively. Similarly, overdose loss affected participants in all income groups, although those in households earning less than $30,000 annually were most likely to know someone who died of overdose, at 40 percent, compared to 26 percent of households earning $100,000 or more per year.\n\n\u201cThis study contributes new evidence that the addiction crisis and the losses that come with it are common across Americans, but the burden is greater among those who are more economically vulnerable,\u201d says Ettman, a coauthor of the study. \u201cAddressing addiction can be a unifying theme in increasingly divided times.\u201d\n\nMore than one million Americans have died from drug overdose since the opioid epidemic began in the late 1990s, driven over time by harmful use of prescription opioids, heroin, and most recently, fentanyl and other synthetic drugs, which have contributed to a sharp increase in fatal overdoses among adolescents and are currently linked to 70 percent of overdose deaths nationwide.\n\n\u201cThe profound impact of drug overdose extends far beyond individual tragedies, underscoring the urgency of shifting the narrative around drug overdose from isolated incidents to a widespread public health crisis,\u201d says study coauthor Salma Abdalla (SPH\u201916,\u201922), assistant professor of global health and epidemiology at SPH. \u201cBy recognizing the collective burden carried by those affected by overdose, we can galvanize support for comprehensive policies and interventions that address addiction, provide resources for prevention and treatment, and destigmatize those struggling with substance use.\u201d\n\nThe study was funded by the de Beaumont Foundation. Additional coauthors include Sarah Gollust, professor in the Division of Health Policy & Management at the University of Minnesota; Sachini Bandara, assistant professor in the Department of Mental Health at the Bloomberg School; and Brian Castrucci, president and chief executive officer of the de Beaumont Foundation.\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling or in crisis, help is available: Call or text 988, or chat on 988lifeline.org.

The affordability crisis in child care threatens not only strapped families but also a network of facilities struggling to stay in business .",
        "text": "Skyrocketing child care costs show how inflation could impact 2024 election\nJessica Morrison and Jason West, a Philadelphia-area couple with a 4-year-old daughter, stood on the verge of a financial breakthrough.\n\nWest was breezing through the hiring process to become a driver at UPS, a job that paid $400 a week and would supplement Jessica\u2019s salary as a state employee.\n\n\u201cIt was exciting,\u201d Morrison told ABC News, recounting a moment that took place five years ago. \u201cThis was something that could bring us up.\u201d\n\nTheir hopes soured, however, when they realized child care would cost them all of the added income, even as the loss of West\u2019s flexible schedule would complicate the family\u2019s daily life. West withdrew his application.\n\n\u201cIt was really disheartening,\u201d said West, who has worked gig jobs ever since. Though their daughter has reached school age, the couple says child care costs have become even less affordable for their 5-year-old son.\n\nAs the November election approaches, inflation ranks as a top issue for voters beset by a yearslong surge in the price of essentials like gasoline, flour and housing. But less attention has been paid to the skyrocketing cost of child care, which strains the monthly budget for millions of families.\n\nThe affordability crisis in child care threatens not only strapped families but also a vast network of facilities struggling to stay in business as well as the nation\u2019s overall economic strength, which depends on the capacity of parents to work outside the home, experts told ABC News.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans in Washington, D.C., differ significantly on the issue, amplifying the stakes of this year\u2019s election, Rachel VanSickle-Ward, a professor of political studies at Pitzer College, told ABC News.\n\n\u201cBased on who wins in November -- both at the presidential level and at the congressional level -- it is make it or break it for child care policy,\u201d VanSickle-War said.\n\nFamilies in the U.S. spend an average of $11,000 on child care each year, which amounts to a nearly 250% increase since 1991, the advocacy group Child Care Aware found in 2022.\n\nIn recent months, the rise in prices has accelerated. The cost of child care climbed 4.1% over the year ending in April, outpacing the overall inflation rate by more than half a percentage point, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows.\n\nJoanne Sawicki Luszczak and her daughter Tiffany Martin, the owners of Teddy Bear College in Bensalem, Pennsylvania, say they have raised the price of tuition in recent years as a means of weathering increased costs of their own.\n\nTeddy Bear College provides snacks and lunch for students each day, leaving its balance sheet vulnerable to the recent rise in food prices.\n\nMeanwhile, the child care center has raised wages for its workers, trying to stem an exodus of entry-level employees who have sought better pay elsewhere. While pay has increased for workers the past few years, the median weekly wage in child care is $635, or about $33,000 a year, Axios reported in April.\n\n\u201cThe challenge of actually retaining good quality staff is tricky, because what the tuition brings in is what we have to pay,\u201d Sawicki Luszczak said. \u201cIf we raise tuition, we can give raises out. Well, there's a limit to that.\u201d\n\nThe squeeze faced by families and child care centers has elicited policy proposals at the state and federal level.\n\nJoanne Sawicki Luszczak and her daughter Tiffany Martin, the owners of Teddy Bear College in Bensalem, Penn. Jason Potere/ABC News\n\nIn Pennsylvania, a key swing state, a bipartisan measure last year expanded the state\u2019s child tax credit.\n\nEligible families -- those earning less than $43,000 a year with two or more children -- receive a state tax credit of $2,100, delivering a 100% match to the federal tax credit. Families above the income threshold receive a tax credit of $1,200.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Tina Davis, a sponsor of the law, said it will lower the cost barrier for families and, in turn, help boost income at day care centers and other businesses.\n\n\u201cIt just puts money in people's pockets,\u201d Davis said. \u201cWhen you put money in people's pockets, they're going to spend it. It's going to help small businesses.\u201d\n\nRepublican Rep. Joe Hogan, who also backed the measure, said its benefits will extend economy-wide as it allows some parents to remain at their job or enjoy the latitude to pursue a new one.\n\n\u201cNo party has a monopoly on good ideas,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be putting families first. We need more policies so that people feel comfortable entering the workforce.\u201d\n\nBipartisan agreement has proven elusive at the federal level, however. Congress has failed to renew a pandemic-era expansion of the federal child tax credit that expired in 2022.\n\nPresident Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump offer dramatically different approaches to the issue, said VanSickle-Ward, of Pitzer College.\n\nBiden has sought a role for the federal government to spend on making child care more affordable, she added. Child care subsidies were included in Build Back Better, a 2021 spending package backed by Biden that failed to garner sufficient support in Congress.\n\nIn his state of the union address, in March, Biden proposed a minimum tax for billionaires that would help fund federal support for families seeking child care.\n\n\u201cImagine a future with affordable child care so millions of families can get the care they need and still go to work and help grow the economy,\u201d Biden said.\n\nIn a statement to ABC News, the Biden campaign contrasted the policies taken up by the two major candidates.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump has no plan to help lower the costs of child care, in fact, his agenda raises costs on the typical American family by at least $1,700 annually, cuts Social Security and Medicare, and repeals the Affordable Care Act. President Biden knows that affordable child care lifts our economy, which is why he\u2019s fighting everyday to lower costs and give families more breathing room,\u201d Biden campaign spokesperson Seth Schuster said.\n\nFor his part, Trump proposed a $1,200 tax credit for child care during his 2016 campaign. A year later, Trump enacted his signature tax measure, which expanded the child tax credit from $1,000 to $2,000 per child. The expanded child tax credit was unavailable to more than 25 million low-income families, however, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\n\u201cI haven't heard as much from Trump on childcare in this election cycle,\u201d VanSickle-Ward said.\n\nIn a statement to ABC News, the Trump campaign touted his record on child care and faulted Biden for the price spike.\n\n\"President Trump doubled the Child Tax Credit, expanded access to quality, affordable childcare, and created the first paid family leave tax credit for job creators -- easing the burden on hardworking parents and families,\" said Karoline Leavitt, national press secretary for the Trump campaign. \"Due to Joe Biden's out-of-control spending, prices are up, real wages are down, and it\u2019s harder than ever for families to make ends meet.\"\n\n\"By making life affordable again and empowering parents, President Trump will ease the burden of Bidenflation, improve academic excellence for students, and strengthen our childcare system for all American families,\" Leavitt added.\n\nRegardless of what happens in November, the affordability of child care will hold major implications for the U.S. going forward, VanSickle-Ward said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really impossible to overstate how impactful child care is to the economy,\u201d VanSickle-Ward said.",

The appeals court is expected to rule on the disqualification issue by March 2025 .",
        "text": "Donald Trump election subversion conspiracy case indefinitely paused by Georgia appeals court\nCNN \u2014\n\nA Georgia appeals court has halted the election subversion conspiracy case against Donald Trump and several of his co-defendants \u2013 a massive victory for the former president seeking to push further legal issues until 2025 if he can\u2019t beat them altogether.\n\nThe new order filed on Wednesday from the Georgia Court of Appeals is the latest indication that a trial in the state-level Georgia election subversion case will not occur before the 2024 presidential election. The court said the case will be on hold until a panel of judges rules on whether Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis should be disqualified.\n\nThe appeals court is expected to rule on the disqualification issue by March 2025, though it could issue a ruling sooner. Several sources close to the case have told CNN that the timeline remains very uncertain.\n\nFulton County Superior Judge Scott McAfee had initially allowed proceedings in his courtroom to continue as the appeals court weighed an appeal of his decision to allow Willis to remain on the case.\n\nA spokesperson for Willis\u2019 office said they can\u2019t comment on the appeals court\u2019s order at this point. The DA can ask the appeals court to fast track a decision in this matter if it chooses.\n\nThe appeals court\u2019s decision underscores Trump\u2019s series of successes in his long-running strategy to put prosecutors on the defensive, attack them in the public sphere and challenge them in court.\n\nTrump and some of his co-defendants in the sprawling racketeering case have been trying to get Willis disqualified from the case because of a romantic relationship she had with Nathan Wade, the special prosecutor she hired to help handle the case. The defendants argued that Willis financially benefited from the relationship with Wade, who defense attorneys say covered several vacations for the pair.\n\nIn March, after what amounted to a mini-trial where attorneys for Trump and his co-defendants sought to prove their case against Willis and Wade, McAfee found there was not enough evidence to firmly prove Willis financially benefited from the relationship.\n\nWillis\u2019 testimony in televised proceedings put her personal life in the spotlight, turning discussion away from the charges Trump and others face in Georgia.\n\nThe judge ultimately decided Willis would be allowed to continue to helm the case if Wade stepped down, which he later did.\n\nSteve Sadow, Trump\u2019s lead defense counsel in Georgia, said the ruling was proper.\n\n\u201cThe Georgia Court of Appeals has properly stayed all proceedings against President Trump in the trial court pending its decision on our interlocutory appeal which argues the case should be dismissed and Fulton County DA Willis should be disqualified for her misconduct,\u201d Sadow said in a statement.\n\nSpeaking briefly to pool reporters Wednesday night, Trump was asked if he\u2019d lost confidence in his legal team after the guilty verdict in his criminal hush money trial in New York. \u201cNo, it\u2019s a rigged system and it\u2019s a terrible system actually,\u201d Trump said.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re doing very well. We had a big thing happen in Georgia today,\u201d the former president said.\n\nFlorida delays help Trump as well\n\nMeanwhile, in Trump\u2019s classified documents case in Florida, the federal judge overseeing those proceedings has shown propensity to devote large amounts of in-court time to Trump\u2019s requests to question investigators and his prosecutors\u2019 authority.\n\nThat judge, Aileen Cannon, indicated on Wednesday she still appears to be willing to hold a hearing where Trump could attempt to put federal investigators under oath so his attorneys could question them, and said she\u2019ll dedicate a day and a half this month to hearing arguments about the legality of his prosecutor.\n\nLike the Georgia case, the Florida documents case has no set trial date.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.",

        "text": "Bitcoin to reach $150,000 if Trump wins presidency, according to Standard Chartered\nThe U.S. presidential election has emerged as the next key catalyst for the price of bitcoin \u2014 potentially pushing it to $150,000 by the end of the year, according to Standard Chartered. After the launch of U.S. bitcoin exchange-traded funds at the beginning of the year, crypto has become an issue of growing and bipartisan interest in Washington. The U.S. historically has held a predominantly anti-crypto stance, but lawmakers more recently have been raising questions about how long that can or should continue. \"As we approach the U.S. election I expect $100,000 to be reached and then $150,000 by year-end in the case of a Trump victory,\" Geoff Kendrick, head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered, wrote of bitcoin. After Friday's big jobs report, \"the next large driver for BTC will then become the US election,\" he added. \"The Biden administration recently showed pragmatism in approving the ETH ETFs, but subsequently Biden vetoed efforts to repeal SAB 121 . So Trump is still more friendly than Biden.\" SAB 121 refers to a Securities and Exchange Commission accounting policy that pushes banks to treat digital assets as liabilities on their books. Bitcoin could reach a new record over the weekend if Friday's nonfarm payrolls report is friendly, Kendrick said. That would pave the way for $80,000 later this month. The cryptocurrency's current record, reached on March 14, is $73,797.68.\n\nDado Ruvic | Reuters",

        "text": "Can Marco Rubio be Donald Trump's VP pick? Here's what the U.S. Constitution says\nCould U.S. Senator Marco Rubio be the next Vice President of the United States? Legally?\n\n\u201cHis name is coming up a lot for vice president,\u201d former president Donald Trump said about Rubio at a gathering at Mar-a-Lago in May where the senior Florida senator appeared along with other potential VP candidates Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C.; Sen. J.D. Vance, R-Ohio; Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y.; South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem; and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum.\n\nRubio, 53, who called Trump a \u201ccon artist\u201d during the 2016 presidential primary and has opposed many of his policies, particularly on immigration and Ukraine, has been gradually shifting his public opinions to align with the presumptive GOP presidential candidate. He recently dodged the question of whether he would accept the results of the 2024 election, as have the other VP potentials.\n\nWill Donald Trump choose Marco Rubio to be his vice president?\n\nTrump has yet to decide on a running mate. The decision may have been delayed by his recent court trial where he became the first former president to be convicted of a crime with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to cover up a hush money payment of $130,000 to adult movie star Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 presidential election.\n\nTrump has said there's a \"pretty good chance\" he will announce his pick at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee in July, four days after he receives his felony sentencing. Insiders said this week that his campaign requested additional information from at least four of his contenders, Burgham, Vance, Scott and, yes, Rubio, USA TODAY reported.\n\nTrump relentlessly mocked Rubio during the 2016 campaign, calling him \"Little Marco.\" Rubio responded with a slam against Trump's spray tan and said he had small hands, \u201cand you know what they say about men with small hands.\u201d But after Trump became the candidate Rubio supported him against Hillary Clinton, and campaigned for him in 2022.\n\nBut even if their differences are sorted out, there could be a Constitutional dilemma: Can people from the same state run on the same presidential ticket? Can we have two Florida Men in the White House?\n\nAnswer: Yes, but it's tricky.\n\nCan Marco Rubio legally run as Donald Trump's vice president?\n\nThe U.S. Constitution has no restrictions on whether the candidates for president and vice president can be from the same state. According to the Constitution, to run for president you must be:\n\nAt least 35 years old\n\nA natural-born citizen who has lived in the U.S. for at least 14 years\n\nAnd that's it, aside from term limitations. The vice president must also meet those qualifications.\n\nHowever, the Constitution does have restrictions on electoral voters choosing candidates from the same state, and that could be a problem.\n\nCan Marco Rubio be elected vice president on a Trump-Rubio ticket?\n\nIf Trump carries Florida, as expected, fellow Floridian Rubio can't get any electoral votes.\n\nThe 12th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution says that, when the Electoral College meets to determine the president, \"the electors shall meet in their respective states, and vote by ballot for two persons, of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves.\"\n\nAccording to PolitiFact, experts have interpreted this to mean that if the two people on the presidential ticket come from the same state, electors from that state can't vote for both. Trump established his Florida residency at Mar-a-Lago in 2019 and Rubio is on his third term representing the state.\n\nThat means the 30 Florida electoral voters can vote for either Trump or Rubio, but not both. Since they're more likely to vote for Trump, that could potentially leave the country without an elected vice-president.\n\nAs Trump has said, \"Marco has this residency problem.\"\n\nIf Trump-Rubio wins in 2024, who decides the vice president?\n\nIf Florida's electoral voters vote for Trump, they'll have to vote for anyone else besides Rubio for veep. If that means there is no VP winner in the electoral college the decision goes to the Senate to choose from the two people with the most votes.\n\nCurrently, the Democrats hold a slight edge there but senators elected before the Jan. 20 inauguration would also have a voice and the Dems could lose their lead. And no matter which political party has a majority, they probably wouldn't have a supermajority to override any filibusters so the final outcome might get messy.\n\nIs a Trump/Harris administration possible under those circumstances? Barely, but it's probably not on anybody's wish list.\n\nCan Rubio move to another state?\n\nThere's precedent. Dick Cheney left Texas in 2000 for Wyoming to run for vice president with fellow Texan George W. Bush. But Cheney owned property in Wyoming and had several significant ties to the state, including representing Wyoming in the U.S. House for 10 years.\n\nRubio would have to give up the Senate seat he currently holds till 2029, potentially giving the Democrats a larger majority in the Senate, and he doesn't seem to have major ties to anywhere but the Sunshine State.\n\nAlso, some states have restrictions or mandatory residency periods before someone can be declared a resident for some purposes. Just buying another house somewhere else might not be enough.\n\nTrump could move himself, of course, but that doesn't seem terribly likely. He probably won't move back to his old home in New York, where in separate cases over the last year he was found guilty on felony charges, found guilty of real estate fraud with a $454 million penalty, and found liable for $83.3 million for sexually assaulting and defaming journalist E. Jean Carroll.\n\nCould Rubio still be a senator from Florida if he lives somewhere else?\n\nRubio could establish residency in another state and continue to represent Florida in the Senate. The Constitution just says senators have to be residents of their states when elected.\n\nBut there could be legal challenges to this sort of move. Whatever happens, it would be an uphill battle.\n\nWhy was the 12th Amendment passed?\n\nOriginally people ran for president in the U.S. and the person who came in second became the vice president. Each elector was given two votes, one of which had to be for someone outside the electors's home state to increase the diversity of the candidates and prevent electors from voting in local \"favorite sons.\"\n\n\"However, you can probably see the problem,\" said Florida Atlantic University political science professor Kevin Wagner. \"The chief vote-getters are likely to be political rivals, and not exactly strong candidates to work together.\"\n\nAfter Thomas Jefferson became the runner-up to rival John Adams in 1796, things got heated. So much so that in 1804 during Jefferson's first term as president, the United States adopted the 12th Amendment and moved the vice president to a separate ballot but kept the same-state electoral college restriction.\n\nNow the candidates for president and vice president could run on a unified ticket, as they have since.",

        "text": "US Presidential Election 2024: How America Elects Its President? Know Key Candidates, Poll Process And Other Details Here\nUS President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump will face each other in the 2024 US presidential election in what is anticipated to be a fiercely fought contest. The US Presidential election is set to be held on November 5, 2024. The US has two main political parties: the Democrats and the Republicans. Apart from the Republicans and the Democrats, the third front, known as an \u201cindependent party\u201d, includes those who run as a candidate for a party formed outside the two main political parties. The third front parties are the Green Party, the Libertarian Party, the American Solidarity Party and Justice for All Party. Out of all the candidates, the main battle for vote will primarily be between Joe Biden and Donald Trump.\n\nBut, how exactly Presidential candidates are chosen and how do US citizens elect their favourite candidate? Here\u2019s all you need to know about the 2024 United States Presidential Election.\n\nEach US state has a specific number of electoral college votes significantly based on its population. The election is contested on a total number of 538 electoral colleges and the winner is the candidate that achieves 270 or more. The Electoral College is the group of presidential electors that is formed every four years to vote for the president and vice president. This equates to the fact that voters decide state-level contests rather than national ones, which makes it possible for a candidate to win the most votes nationally.\n\nHow The US Presidential Election Process Works\n\nInterestingly, US people have the right to choose their presidential candidates and this process is done through primaries and caucuses. Primaries are held in most states six to nine months before a presidential election. By using secret ballots, primary voters select their favourite candidate in an anonymous manner. Caucuses are meetings and assemblies run by political parties that are held at the county, district or precinct level. The outcomes of the vote are taken into consideration by the state hosting the primary in order to assign delegates to the winners. Currently, the US is holding the primaries in several states. President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump have won Democratic and Republican primaries in a handful of states, among some of the last contests on the 2024 primary calendar.\n\nDelegates\n\nEach state, the District of Columbia and some US territories are allocated a number of delegates, usually decided by population size. In addition, a formula is used to adjust the number by \u201crewarding\u201d states that, for example, voted for the last party\u2019s Presidential candidate. These delegates represent their state in the national party convention and vote to decide each party's presidential nominee.\n\nThere are mainly two types of delegates, pledged and unpledged. Pledged delegates support the candidates to whom they were assigned in a primary or caucus round, while unpledged Delegates are the ones who can choose freely which candidate they would like to support. Once delegates are selected, they go on to the national convention to vote to confirm their candidate.\n\nThe Voting Day\n\nThis year, the people of the US will go to vote on November 5. After the results are announced, the Inauguration Day takes place on January 20 at the U.S. Capitol building in Washington D.C. First, the Vice President takes oath, followed by the President.\n\nWho Are The Candidates For The 2024 US Presidential Election?\n\nDonald Trump (Republican)\n\nFormer US President and the Republican Party Nominee for the next US Presidential election, Donald John Trump announced his candidature on November 15, 2022, seeking a second non-consecutive term. Trump unsuccessfully sought election to a second term in the 2020 United States presidential election, losing to Democratic candidate Joe Biden, who obtained an electoral vote of 306 to Trump's 232.\n\nHe also enters the race encumbered with personal and professional legal struggles that have not yet been resolved. He faces charges over his alleged participation in a scheme to interfere with the peaceful transfer of power after he lost the 2020 election to Joe Biden, as well as three other criminal cases including the much-talked-about Hush Money case involving adult film star Stormy Daniels.\n\nJoe Biden (Democrat)\n\nDemocratic Party Candidate and current US President Joe Biden is also running for the US Presidential election in 2024. Biden is the oldest US president and also the first to have a female Vice President. Biden announced his candidature on April 25, 2023.\n\nMarianne Williamson (Democrat)\n\nMarianne Williamson, Democratic Party nominee and a self-help author and former spiritual adviser to Oprah Winfrey will be running for a second time in the 2024 US Presidential Campaign. Marianne came in third place in the 2024 New Hampshire primary, with 4 per cent of the total votes. Names of other independent and third-party runners include Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Cornel West, Jill Stein, and Chase Oliver.\n\nIn the last presidential election in 2020, Joe Biden was elected the 46th president of the United States. Biden defeated Donald Trump after winning Pennsylvania, which put his total of Electoral College votes above the 270 that he needed to clinch the presidency.",

        "text": "Trump\u2019s lead over Biden narrows after conviction, analysis shows\nAfter a Manhattan jury found Donald Trump guilty on 34 felony counts last week, Republicans rallied around the former president, insisting the verdict would only damage Joe Biden\u2019s standing in the presidential election.\n\nBut some new polling data casts doubt upon that argument, as a small but crucial number of Americans in key voting blocs appear to be moving toward Biden in the aftermath of the verdict.\n\nAccording to a post-verdict analysis of nearly 2,000 interviews with voters who previously participated in New York Times/Siena College surveys, Trump\u2019s advantage over the president has narrowed from three points to one point. That shift may seem insignificant, but it could prove decisive in a close presidential election, as is expected in this year\u2019s contest. In 2020, just 44,000 votes across three battleground states prevented a tie in the electoral college.\n\nPerhaps more worrisome for Trump is the specific areas where he appears to be bleeding support. According to the Times analysis, disengaged Democratic-leaning voters and those who dislike both Trump and Biden were more likely to say that the verdict made them reconsider their options in the election.\n\nBoth of those voting groups have played a significant role in boosting Trump\u2019s polling performance in recent months. Among those who voted for Biden in 2020 and previously indicated that they would back Trump this year, roughly one-fourth said they would now support the incumbent president. Voters who dislike both candidates, the so-called \u201cdouble haters\u201d, are viewed as particularly influential this year, and the Times analysis showed Trump losing more than one-fifth of his pre-verdict support among those voters.\n\nPolling data compiled after Trump\u2019s conviction is still somewhat limited, but at least one other post-verdict survey corroborated the Times\u2019 findings. The Republican firm Echelon Insights conducted a study showing Biden with a two-point advantage over Trump among recontacted voters, while those same respondents\u2019 answers indicated a tie between the two candidates before the jury delivered its verdict.\n\nBut other warning signs remain for Biden, particularly in the battleground states that he will need to win to secure re-election. A Quinnipiac University poll of voters in Georgia, which Biden won by 0.2 points in 2020, showed Trump with a five-point lead in a head-to-head match-up against the incumbent, although that result was within the survey\u2019s margin of error. When other candidates, including independent Robert F Kennedy, were added to the list of options, Trump\u2019s lead grew to six points, which was outside the margin of error.\n\nEven as the survey showed Biden trailing in Georgia, the poll also found that 50% of voters in the battleground state agreed with the verdict in the Manhattan case, underscoring the mixed feelings triggered by Trump\u2019s conviction.\n\nA Times Opinion focus group of 11 undecided voters, conducted hours after the verdict was announced last week, reflected an array of opinions on the outcome of the case, with some participants say they were increasingly leaning toward supporting Kennedy. At least one person said the verdict made him less likely to vote for Biden, arguing that Trump\u2019s conviction made Biden look \u201cungracious\u201d. Another voter said Biden has \u201cdirty hands on this\u201d, an apparent reference to Trump\u2019s baseless claims of political persecution.\n\n\u201cI guess I thought Joe Biden was above this,\u201d said John, a 58-year-old white customer relations employee from Pennsylvania.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Stakes \u2014 Presidential Transition Free newsletter We will guide you through the aftermath of the US election and the transition to a Trump presidency Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

One voter named Ben, a 42-year-old white college adviser from Texas, suggested he was leaning toward Biden because Trump\u2019s conviction proved his incompetence.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal about bribing Stormy Daniels? But I want a president who\u2019s going to be able to cover up a $130,000 bribe to Daniels,\u201d Ben said. \u201cIf he can\u2019t pull that off, I\u2019m not going to trust him with the nuclear football. This seems like such an easy thing for him to screw up. I\u2019m kind of leaning toward Biden now.\u201d\n\nWith five months to go until election day, voters still have time to consider \u2013 and reconsider \u2013 their thoughts on Trump\u2019s conviction.",

Here is a timeline of events related to the November 5 election between now and Inauguration Day in January 2025.\n\n\u2013 June 8: Guam and the US Virgin Islands hold Democratic nominating contests.\n\n\u2013 June 27: CNN will hold the first 2024 debate between Biden and Trump in Atlanta, Georgia, moderated by anchors Jake Tapper and Dana Bash and with no audience present. The agreement between the campaigns breaks the decades-old tradition of three fall debates. September and October dates had already been set by the Commission on Presidential Debates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2013 July 11: Trump, the first sitting or former US president to be convicted of a crime, will be sentenced in the Manhattan hush money case where he was found guilty of falsifying documents to cover up a payment to silence a porn star. He denies wrongdoing and plans to appeal.\n\nDonald Trump speaking to members of the media upon arriving at Manhattan criminal court, during the hush money trial.

Fox wrote to both campaigns suggesting July 23, August 13 or other dates following the party conventions. Trump\u2019s campaign has not said whether his running mate would debate Harris on CBS nor has the Biden campaign said if Harris would debate on Fox.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2013 By Aug. 7: The Democrats are set to hold a \u201cvirtual roll call\u201d to nominate Biden and ensure that he is on the ballot in Ohio, which has an Aug. 7 ballot certification deadline. Biden had been due to be officially nominated at the Democratic National Convention later in August.\n\nJoe Biden delivering remarks on the verdict in Donald Trump \u2019s trial and on the Middle East, from the White House.

Ahead of the count on January 6, 2021, then-President Trump lambasted his vice president, Mike Pence, for refusing to try to prevent Congress from certifying Biden\u2019s win. On that day, the U.S. Capitol was attacked by rioters, and some people chanted, \u201chang Mike Pence\u201d as they tried to stop the count.

Can she make a difference?\n\nMargaret Thatcher in Britain. Angela Merkel in Germany. And now Claudia Sheinbaum in Mexico. All three are the first women to be elected leader of their nations. All three are also renowned for their scientific expertise.\n\nHistorically, the combination has been a boon for environmental issues. In the late 1980s, Thatcher, who had a background as a research chemist, sounded the alarm on global warming at the UN. In the 2010s, Merkel, with a doctorate in quantum chemistry, was a champion of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.\n\nBut as their tenures continued, their green advocacy declined, particularly at home. Germany nearly missed its 2020 emissions reduction target. And later in her premiership, Thatcher made an about-face on climate change \u2013 de-crying it as an \"excuse for worldwide, supra-national socialism\"; a position that continues to find echoes in populist right-wing rhetoric today.\n\nSheinbaum, by comparison, specifically studied environmental engineering and has played a key role in communicating the scientific consensus around climate change on the international stage. So what might a climate scientist-turned world leader mean for the ongoing global attempts to tackle what is widely considered to be the greatest challenge of our time? And will Sheinbaum\u2019s environmental promises withstand the tests of power?\n\nA Mexican first\n\nThe 61-year-old arguably has the most formal climate-science background of any political premier in history.\n\nAfter studying for a doctorate in California \u2013 on emissions from buildings and the environmental impacts of Mexico City\u2019s transport sector \u2013 Sheinbaum joined the staff at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. In 2007 and 2014, she contributed to two major reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), with the body winning a Nobel Prize for its efforts to create an \"informed consensus about the connection between human activities and global warming\".\n\nGetty Images As mayor of Mexico City, Claudia Sheinbaum advocated for solar energy and public transport reform (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nSheinbaum\u2019s expertise could be seen as timely. Her nation\u2019s capital, Mexico City, is currently in the grip of a heatwave so brutal that monkeys are falling out of trees. Internationally, each of the past 12 months has also set new records in global temperature and the world's ocean surface temperatures are also at record-breaking highs. And there is much in her political career to suggest she will take action.\n\nAs mayor of Mexico City, a position she held from 2018 to 2023, Sheinbaum spear-headed public transport reform and championed solar energy, installing the largest solar project of its kind in the world.\n\nAccording to Jose Luis Samaniego, the World Resources Institute\u2019s (WRI) executive director for Mexico and Colombia, under her various roles, Sheinbaum introduced the capital's first Metrobus (a rapid bus transit system), expanded it, added its first electrified line, and launched elevated trolley buses. All of which has contributed to a \"big improvement to quality of life\", says Samaniego, especially for underserved communities. By providing an alternative to personal cars and replacing more polluting bus services that preceded it, the Metrobus service is reducing carbon dioxide emissions in the city by 35,000 tonnes per year, while also helping to improve air quality.\n\nDuring her presidential campaign, Sheinbaum promised to boost renewable energy investment by $13.57 billion (\u00a310.61bn), and to deliver rapid action on decarbonisation. If she follows through on advancing a \"low and just carbon transition\", an analysis by WRI estimates a 3.5% increase in jobs and a 1.6% rise in GDP.\n\nMexico's economy is still dependent on fossil fuels and it is the world's 11th largest oil producer\n\nOn water shortages too, Sheinbaum is taking a \"step in the right direction\", says Sandra Aguilar-Gomez, assistant professor at the Universidad de los Andes. \"The current regulations have several loopholes that allow \u2018water millionaires\u2019 with virtually unlimited water rights, while six out of 10 households in Mexico lack access to safe drinking water,\" Aguilar-Gomez says, noting that Sheinbaum has announced a National Water Plan that would address the inequality.\n\nYet many have reservations about the degree of change the new leader will be able to enact.\n\nAn oiled machine\n\nSheinbaum\u2019s predecessor, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, was heavily criticised by green groups. He opposed private companies investing in Mexico\u2019s electricity sector, which some argue would have seen more money flow to renewables \u2013 and instead backed greater, state-led fossil fuel production as a means to energy independence.\n\nConsequently, by aligning herself closely with L\u00f3pez Obrador and running on behalf of his ruling left-wing party Morena, there are some who believe that Sheinbaum will continue in this direction. Her roadmap does not mention net zero. And while, in a televised debate, she promised to help Mexico adapt to climate change when she takes office on 1 October, she also defended L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s construction of a new oil refinery.\n\n\"In one of the debates, she expressed that she envisioned the country becoming a global climate action leader. However, Mexico is still far from that trajectory, and Dr Sheinbaum would need to shift the country away from oil reliance, which would be a significant break from her predecessor,\" says Aguilar-Gomez.\n\nGetty Images Mexico's Yucat\u00e1n mega train, Tren Maya, has received criticism from environmental groups (Credit: Getty Images)\n\n\"A surprising missing item from her [Sheinbaum's] campaign is biodiversity,\" Aguilar-Gomez adds. Between 10-12% of the world\u2019s species can be found in Mexico, yet L\u00f3pez Obrador \u2013 also often known by his initials Amlo \u2013 drew heavy criticism for a railway mega-project that passed through sensitive habitats. The government, however, insists it will bring a vital economic boost to the communities it connects.\n\n\"Sheinbaum is planning to continue expanding passenger rail and she will not overhaul Amlo's infrastructure projects,\" notes Aguilar-Gomez. \"However, she has the opportunity to include impact assessments in these projects and remediation plans, which have been absent from the current administration.\"\n\nA world of difference?\n\nSquaring the circle of state-owned energy production that currently promotes energy independence through fossil fuels and transitioning to clean energy won\u2019t be an easy task. But if Sheinbaum can make progress on the problem, she will set a notable example for other nations, suggests Samaniego.\n\n\"I think this may reposition Mexico,\" says Samaniego. \"Not only in the international arena, as going back to a proactive policy on climate, but maybe we will also have the opportunity to show the positive synergies that can exist between social priorities, economic dynamics and lowering the environmental footprint of a country,\" he says.\n\nSign up to Future Earth Sign up to the Future Earth newsletter to get essential climate news and hopeful developments in your inbox every Tuesday from Carl Nasman.

Sign up for newsletters here.\n\nFor the US as well, Sheinbaum\u2019s international climate experience could \"make her a very valuable ally for a second Biden administration\", if President Joe Biden is re-elected in the upcoming US Presidential elections later this year, says Sheila Jasanoff, professor of science and technology studies at the Harvard Kennedy School and who contributed to the same IPCC reports as Sheinbaum, although she says they never met.\n\n\"It would be extremely helpful for the US to have a partner in Mexico who understands the magnitude of the climate problem and is prepared to tackle the related issues at a pan-American level,\" says Jasanoff.\n\nGetty Images Animals as well as humans have suffered in Mexico blistering 2024 heatwave (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nFurthermore, victory for a woman in politics could in itself be a position sign for climate action more generally. Like \"almost all\" of the world\u2019s most intransigent problems, Jasonoff points out, climate change exacts a heavier toll from women. \"It is refreshing to see the world acquire a progressive female leader at a time when so many countries are taking a regressive turn,\" she says.\n\nWhat exactly Sheinbaum's election will mean for climate action around the world will take time to fully unfold. \"It is clearly an issue about which she is knowledgeable, probably more so than any other head of state or head of government in the world,\" says Professor Robert Stavins, director of the Harvard Environmental Economics Program. \"But how this will translate into government action (beyond public statements) is unknown as of now.\"\n\nYet for the US climate scientist Michael Mann, Sheinbaum\u2019s election is an encouraging step. Firstly, Mann says, her climate background rejects the notion that scientists should distinguish themselves from calls for action. And secondly, it is a reminder that \"scientists have to step up to the plate and be willing to consider playing a more public role in the science policy decisions that will shape our future\", he says.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.",

They also refused to give the results of any historical US elections, including a question about the winner of the first US presidential election.\n\nOther chatbots that WIRED tested, including OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT-4, Meta\u2019s Llama, and Anthropic\u2019s Claude, responded to the question about who won the 2020 election by affirming Biden\u2019s victory. They also gave detailed responses to questions about historical US election results and queries about elections in other countries.\n\nThe inability of Microsoft\u2019s and Google\u2019s chatbots to give an accurate response to basic questions about election results comes during the biggest global election year in modern history and just five months ahead of the pivotal 2024 US election. Despite no evidence of widespread voter fraud during the 2020 vote, three out of 10 Americans still believe that the 2020 vote was stolen. Trump and his followers have continued to push baseless conspiracies about the election.\n\nGoogle confirmed to WIRED that Gemini will not provide election results for elections anywhere in the world, adding that this is what the company meant when it previously announced its plan to restrict \u201celection-related queries.\u201d\n\n\u201cOut of an abundance of caution, we\u2019re restricting the types of election-related queries for which Gemini app will return responses and instead point people to Google Search,\u201d Google communications manager Jennifer Rodstrom tells WIRED.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s senior director of communications Jeff Jones confirmed Copilot\u2019s unwillingness to respond to queries about election results, telling WIRED: \u201cAs we work to improve our tools to perform to our expectations for the 2024 elections, some election-related prompts may be redirected to search.\u201d",

        "text": "Early controversies over election certification in battleground states raise concerns about presidential race\nIn Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula, two Republican members of a county canvassing board last month refused to sign off on the results of an election that led to the recall of three GOP members of the county commission. They did so only after state officials warned them it was their legal duty to record the final vote tally.\n\nIn Georgia\u2019s Fulton County, which includes the Democratic-voting city of Atlanta, a group run by members of former President Donald Trump\u2019s administration last week sued so a Republican member of the local elections board could refuse to certify the results of the primary election.\n\nAnd in Arizona, GOP lawmakers sued to reverse the state\u2019s top Democratic officials\u2019 requirement that local boards automatically validate their election results.\n\nThe past four years have been filled with battles over all sorts of election arcana, including one that had long been regarded as an administrative afterthought \u2014 little-known state and local boards certifying the results. With the presidential election looming in November, attorneys are gearing up for yet more fights over election certification, especially in the swing states where the victory margins are expected to be tight. Even if those efforts ultimately fail, election officials worry they\u2019ll become a vehicle for promoting bogus election claims.\n\nTrump and his allies have tried to use the tactic to stop election results from being made final if they lose. In 2020, two Republicans on Michigan\u2019s state board of canvassers, which must certify ballot totals before state officials can declare a winner, briefly balked at signing off before one relented and became the decisive vote. Trump had cheered the delay as part of his push to overturn his loss that ultimately culminated in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\nDuring the 2022 midterms, some conservative, rural counties tried to hold up their state election results, citing the same debunked claims of voter fraud that Trump has made.\n\nIn New Mexico, rural county supervisors refused to certify the state\u2019s primary vote until they were threatened with prosecution. In Cochise County in southeastern Arizona, two Republican supervisors who refused to certify the local vote totals said they had no doubt their own county\u2019s tally was accurate but were protesting the counts in other counties that gave Democratic candidates for governor, attorney general and secretary of state their victories.\n\nREAD MORE: Election deniers hold critical positions in Republican politics despite national rejection\n\nResponding to the certification controversies, Michigan\u2019s Democratic legislature passed a law making clear that state and local canvassing boards must certify election totals. The two Arizona county supervisors are currently facing criminal charges filed by the state\u2019s Democratic attorney general.\n\nDemocrats and nonpartisan groups say the thousands of local election oversight boards across the country aren\u2019t the place to contest ballot counts, and that state laws make clear they have no leeway on whether to sign off on their staff\u2019s final tallies.\n\n\u201cElection authorities don\u2019t have the discretion to reject the results of an election because of their vibes,\u201d said Jonathan Diaz of the Campaign Legal Center, adding that lawsuits and recounts are the proper recourse. \u201cThey\u2019re there to perform a function. They\u2019re there to certify.\u201d\n\nBut some Republicans argue that\u2019s going too far. Kory Langhofer, the attorney suing to overturn the election procedures manual\u2019s directive in Arizona that was issued by the Democratic attorney general and secretary of state, said he didn\u2019t support the effort to block certification in Cochise County in 2022. But, he argued, locally elected boards of supervisors have to have some discretion to police elections.\n\n\u201cIt seems to me the system is stronger when you have multiple eyes on it,\u201d Langhofer said. Of the efforts to block certification in 2020 and 2022, he added, \u201cI hope that\u2019s behind us.\u201d\n\nDemocrats doubt that\u2019s the case. They note that the America First Policy Institute, a pro-Trump organization run by former officials from his administration, filed the lawsuit in Georgia to let Fulton County Elections Board member Julie Adams vote against certifying elections. Adams\u2019 four other board members voted to certify last month\u2019s primary but Adams abstained last week, contending she couldn\u2019t accept the results given prior election administration problems in the county.\n\n\u201cThis action will re-establish the role of board members as the ultimate parties responsible for ensuring elections in Fulton County are free from fraud, deceit, and abuse,\u201d the institute wrote in its release announcing the lawsuit. The group did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nFulton County is the heart of the Democratic vote in Georgia, and anything that holds up its totals in November could help make it look like Trump has a large lead in the state.\n\nREAD MORE: How 2020 election denialism became a litmus test for the GOP\n\n\u201cTrump and MAGA Republicans have made it clear they are planning to try to block certification of November\u2019s election when they are defeated again, and this is a transparent attempt to set the stage for that fight,\u201d Georgia Democratic Party chair and Rep. Nikema Williams said in a statement.\n\nIn Michigan\u2019s Delta County, clerk Nancy Przewrocki, a Republican, said the two GOP canvassers had requested a hand recount of the votes, which is beyond the scope of their position. The canvassers eventually voted to certify the May election after receiving a letter from the State Elections Director Jonathan Brater, which reminded them of their duties and warned them of the consequences of failing to certify.\n\nStill, Przewrocki said she\u2019s concerned about what could happen in November if a similar situation arises.\n\n\u201cI can see this escalating, unfortunately. I\u2019m trying to keep our voters confident in our voting equipment, and this is completely undermining it when there\u2019s really nothing there,\u201d Przewrocki said.\n\nFollowing the Delta County incident, Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson and Attorney General Dana Nessel, both Democrats, issued a reminder to local canvassing boards throughout the state warning them of their legal obligation to certify election results based solely on vote returns. If they don\u2019t, there will be \u201cswift action to ensure the legal certification of election results,\u201d along with \u201cpossible civil and criminal charges against those members for their actions,\u201d Benson warned.\n\nMichigan is an example of the futility of the tactic. The new state law makes it clear that canvassing boards can\u2019t block certification, but Benson said in an interview that she still worries such an effort, even if legally doomed, would help spread false allegations about the November election.\n\n\u201cMisinformation and talking points emerge that enable others \u2014 particularly politicians \u2014 to continue to cast doubt on the accuracy of election results,\u201d she said.\n\nRiccardi reported from Denver and Cappelletti from Lansing, Michigan.

        "text": "Operatives with GOP ties are helping Cornel West get on the ballot in a key state\nCornel West\u2019s independent presidential campaign is broke. His former campaign manager says he knows nothing about ballot access. And he spent more on graphic design than petition-gathering in his most recent campaign finance report.\n\nBut tens of thousands of signatures have been gathered on behalf of the famed left-wing academic in key states thanks to self-organized grassroots volunteers \u2014 and some help from outside operatives tied to a Republican consulting firm.\n\nDemocrats fear West\u2019s potential to siphon votes from President Joe Biden in places where he is on the ballot in a close election, and some Republicans are publicly discussing ways to boost West and other minor candidates like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and the Green Party\u2019s Jill Stein in the hopes of splitting the anti-Donald Trump coalition.\n\nIn North Carolina, for example, a prominent Republican activist was spotted in April outside a Trump rally gathering signatures for West, telling rallygoers it \"helps take away votes from Joe Biden.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a new party formed in the state to get West on the ballot announced Monday that its \u201call-volunteer effort\" had submitted more than 30,000 signatures, despite having virtually no oversight and receiving not \u201ca cent\u201d from West\u2019s campaign.\n\n\u201cWithout this grassroots effort, there\u2019s no way we could have done it,\u201d Drew Lischke, a co-chair of the Justice for All Party of North Carolina, said at a news conference. \u201cThis was a very low, low, low budget operation.\u201d\n\nBut internal emails obtained by NBC News, social media posts and other evidence suggest someone from the outside \u2014 though it\u2019s unclear who or how much, if anything, they spent \u2014 was trying to help West get on the ballot in North Carolina, even if his grassroots allies were not fully aware of it.\n\nEmails from elections officials, obtained through a request under North Carolina's Public Records Law, show the pro-West Justice for All Party authorized three people to pick up and drop off signatures for them statewide \u2014 and all three are current or past employees of a Colorado-based Republican political firm called Blitz Canvassing.\n\nBlitz Canvassing has worked for numerous Republican House and Senate candidates and took in more than $14.6 million in payments working for Never Back Down, the main super PAC that supported former GOP presidential candidate and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, according to campaign finance reports.\n\n\"In the same way that Republicans have quietly pushed ballot access for the Green Party across the country for years, there\u2019s concrete evidence \u2014 not rumors, but evidence \u2014 in North Carolina and in other states of an organized Republican effort to get Cornel West on ballots, using Republican consultants and vendors that the West campaign is not paying for,\" said Pete Kavanaugh, who founded Clear Choice Action, a new Democratic super PAC working to combat third-party candidates.\n\nWest campaign spokesperson Edwin DeJesus said the campaign was \u201cnot aware of these particular individuals being involved with a Republican firm\u201d and so it did \u201cnot have any specific comments since we are not familiar with them or their affiliations.\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever, it\u2019s important to note that our volunteer base encompasses a broad spectrum of political affiliations,\u201d DeJesus added.\n\n'We haven't paid them one cent'\n\nOn May 7, a top official at the North Carolina State Board of Elections emailed colleagues with some \u201cimportant updates and reminders\u201d about various upcoming deadlines and events, according to a redacted copy of the email, which was shared with NBC News after being obtained via a public records request by Clear Choice.\n\nIncluded on the list was an update about the pro-West Justice For All Party's petition efforts. The email alerted other officials that the party\u2019s \"chairperson has authorized the following representatives to drop off and pick up petitions\" throughout the state: Jacob Smith, David Mills and Charisma Harris.\n\nSmith is listed as project manager on Blitz Canvassing's website, and the cellphone number listed in the email matches one given for Smith in a Michigan GOP fundraising email that pointed recipients to him if they had questions. Mills says on LinkedIn that he is employed full time as a project manager for Blitz. And Harris says on LinkedIn that she currently runs her own canvassing firm but served as regional political director for Blitz until January. Before that, she was a campaign manager for Blitz, where she started working in 2022.\n\nItalo Medelius, a co-chair of the Justice for All Party and its official representative to election officials, acknowledged to NBC News that he authorized the three to work on behalf of the campaign, saying he did so because they were familiar with the intricacies of petitioning procedures.\n\nBut he had no idea they worked for Blitz and had never heard of the company, saying their names were included on a list of potential volunteers sent over by West\u2019s campaign, with a notation that they had experience in petition gathering.\n\n\u201cI know Charisma, Jacob and David as volunteers,\u201d Medelius said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t paid them one cent.\u201d\n\nHe said he had known Harris for years and worked with her on the 2020 Bernie Sanders presidential campaign, but said he only became aware of Smith and Mills after they appeared on the West campaign\u2019s volunteer list.\n\n\u201cWe did talk about, from the beginning of this operation, that there might be infiltrators trying to get into the campaign,\u201d Medelius said. \u201cIf there are people that infiltrated or whatever, it could be true, I guess, but I never really had a hint from these folks.\u201d\n\nSmith, Mills and Harris did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nAlyssa Zambrano, a manager at Blitz, told NBC News in a brief interview that she had \u201cno idea\u201d why the three were working on behalf of the Justice for All campaign and said her firm was not doing any work for West.\n\n\u201cWe have nothing to do with that,\u201d Zambrano said. \u201cWe\u2019re not working for them.\u201d\n\nFollow-up emails and text messages asking for more clarification from Blitz went unanswered.\n\n'Beyond fishy'\n\nBefore the consultants' roles were known, the geography of the Justice for All signatures raised alarm bells among local Democrats.\n\nThe pro-West party received large batches of signatures from Republican-leaning counties like Brunswick and New Hanover, while there were proportionally fewer than expected from more Democratic-leaning counties and ones with large university campuses, where West\u2019s progressive and pro-Palestine messaging would be likely to resonate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s beyond fishy,\u201d said Doug Heyl, a North Carolina-based Democratic strategist. \u201cIt seems very likely that a lot of these are Republican signatures that want Cornel West on the ballot to help Trump.\u201d\n\nSeparately, a high-profile Republican activist who focuses on early voting was spotted gathering signatures for West outside a planned rally for former Trump in April in Wilmington, North Carolina.\n\n\u201cThis helps take away votes from Joe Biden,\u201d Scott Presler told a rallygoer, according to a video posted by a Washington Post reporter. \u201cWe\u2019re helping the Trump team who\u2019s trying to get him on there,\u201d added a woman by his side. The rally was later canceled due to bad weather.\n\nDocuments obtained by NBC news suggest this was not just a stunt or idle talk.\n\nHundreds of pages of petition signatures submitted by the Justice for All Party, also obtained through a public records request, show dozens of registered Republicans signed petitions to get the pro-West party on the ballot on the same day as the Trump rally and in the same county.\n\nOn the social media platform X, where Presler has 1.5 million followers, he put out a call ahead North Carolina\u2019s ballot deadline saying, \u201cWe are working on getting Dr. Cornel West on the ballot in North Carolina. If anyone is interested in helping, let me know.\u201d\n\nA week later, he posted again to say he had already \u201csent 40+ folks to our North Carolina organizer, but are still looking for more.\u201d\n\nAsked about Presler on CNN in April, West said he had never heard of the right-wing influencer and did not want his help.\n\n\u201cNo, no, I don\u2019t think so, if it\u2019s just manipulative,\u201d West said. \u201cIf people are just going to use this candidate for X and Y, no, not at all.\u201d\n\nWest campaign struggles\n\nThese efforts are happening on the sidelines of a campaign that has struggled in its own efforts.\n\nGetting on the ballot is the biggest challenge for any independent or third-party candidate \u2014 and also a place where outside forces have a history of meddling \u2014 but West\u2019s campaign has stumbled trying to meet that challenge.\n\nWest\u2019s most recent campaign finance report showed he entered May with just $18,000 in cash and more than that \u2014 $28,000 \u2014 in debt. Campaign finance expert Rob Pyers noted the report showed West\u2019s campaign spent more on graphic design in April than it spent on petitioning services for ballot access.\n\nBy comparison, Kennedy spent more than $2 million on a single company specializing in ballot access for his own independent campaign, according to his own FEC report covering the same time period.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a Kennedy presence in North Carolina. There\u2019s no West presence here,\u201d said Heyl.\n\nIn late April and early May, West\u2019s campaign listed 70 volunteer events across the country, but none were in North Carolina.\n\nBefore running as an independent, West was on track to claim the nomination of the Green Party, which has existing infrastructure and ballot lines he could have used. But West abruptly left the party last fall, stunning Green Party officials like Jill Stein, who was managing his campaign and is now expected to once again be the Greens' nominee in his absence.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t do ballot access on your first time out,\u201d Stein told left-wing podcast host Briahna Joy Gray in a recent interview. \u201cHe\u2019s talking about running as a write-in candidate in Texas, but he doesn\u2019t know that Texas won\u2019t count write-in votes! And that\u2019s true in many states.\u201d\n\nWest and Stein have been feuding after he accused her of being \"addicted\" to running for president and said he had lost \"all respect\" for her.\n\nStein said West has refused to discuss the issue with her and explain why he left the Green Party, adding that he's a \"political novice\" and that it was \"hard to give him advice\" about the mechanics of ballot access and running a campaign.\n\n\u201cThere is absolutely no pathway forward for Dr. West,\" Stein said.\n\nNevertheless, some people are working to clear a path for him.",

It is, in fact, the Russian Federation that has an active chemical weapons program and is in violation of its international obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). The United States determined Russia used the chemical weapon chloropicrin against Ukrainian troops and riot control agents (RCA) as a method of warfare in violation of the CWC. Russia\u2019s use of chloropicrin in Ukraine marks the first time since World War One that this agent is being deployed on the battlefield. By spreading disinformation through media and from international platforms, Russia attempts to create confusion and obfuscate facts to sow enough doubt to undermine the unity and effectiveness of an international response to Russia\u2019s own chemical weapons use.\n\nThis report is also available in Espa\u00f1ol | Arabic | Chinese | Russian | French | Ukrainian | Portuguese | Persian\n\nFebruary 12, 2024\n\nThe Kremlin\u2019s Efforts to Spread Deadly Disinformation in Africa\n\nThe U.S. Department of State\u2019s Global Engagement Center is exposing Russia\u2019s intelligence services for providing material support and guidance to \u201cAfrican Initiative,\u201d a new information agency focused on Africa-Russia relations that has spread disinformation regarding the United States and European countries.\n\nThe death of Wagner Group leader Yevgeniy Prigozhin on August 23, 2023, provides an opportunity to review some of the most egregious ways in which the Russian government has lied about the role, purposes, and so-called successes of the Wagner Group. This bulletin analyzes and counters the false claims Russia continues to spread about the Wagner Group\u2019s activities in Africa and reveals them for what they are \u2013 criminals motivated by greed rather than an effective counterterrorism force.\n\nThis report is also available in French.\n\nIn this two-part report, the U.S. Department of State\u2019s Global Engagement Center (GEC) documents how successive occupants of the Kremlin have exploited antisemitism for disinformation and propaganda purposes.\n\nThis report is also available in Arabic, Chinese, French, Persian, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Ukrainian, and Urdu.\n\nnovemeber 07, 2023\n\nThe Kremlin\u2019s Efforts to Covertly Spread Disinformation in Latin America\n\nThe Kremlin uses both open and hidden networks to manipulate information and spread anti-democratic, authoritarian ideologies around the world. This report focuses on Nova Resist\u00eancia, a neo-fascist, pro-authoritarian group in Brazil with close ties to U.S.-sanctioned fascist Russian philosopher Aleksandr Dugin. Nova Resist\u00eancia, its \u201csister\u201d groups of New Resistance, and its overall network use Kremlin disinformation and propaganda to attempt to destabilize democracies, engage in support for revanchist military activity through quasi-paramilitary groups, and upend the rules-based international order.\n\nThe report is also available in Portuguese and Spanish\n\nThe Kremlin appears determined to erase Ukraine\u2019s existence as a state by attempting to rob it of its future. To deflect responsibility, Russia disseminates disinformation and propaganda attempting to distort its abuses as \u201chumanitarian\u201d gestures. Russia also conducts disinformation and propaganda-filled activities aimed at brainwashing children in Russia-occupied parts of Ukraine or children from Ukraine it deports to Russia into believing that the Kremlin is saving them from a \u201cNazi regime in Kyiv.\u201d Accountability is imperative.\n\nThis bulletin is also available in Arabic, Chinese, French, Hindi, Persian, Russian, Spanish, Ukrainian, and Urdu.\n\nIn the aftermath of Moscow\u2019s July 2023 withdrawal from the Black Sea Grain Initiative, the Kremlin continues to distort data, deny facts, and manipulate math attempting to perpetuate five false myths. Russia\u2019s disinformation myths cannot hide the hard truths that (1) sanctions did not apply to Russia\u2019s grain, (2) Ukraine\u2019s grain is critical to getting adequate food to low-income countries, (3) Russia cannot replace Ukraine\u2019s grain supply, (4) the Kremlin is on track to destroy more grain than it has offered to donate, and (5) every day more Russian missiles and drones intentionally target the vital pipeline that provides Ukraine\u2019s grain to the rest of the world and keeps food prices stable.\n\nThis bulletin is also available in Arabic, Chinese, French, Hindi, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Turkish, Ukrainian and Urdu.\n\nReports\n\nIn this two-part report, the U.S. Department of State\u2019s Global Engagement Center (GEC) documents how successive occupants of the Kremlin have exploited antisemitism for disinformation and propaganda purposes. Part One details the contemporary Kremlin\u2019s use of antisemitic disinformation in the context of its war against Ukraine and describes how Russia\u2019s leaders and propagandists spread anti-Jewish conspiracy theories to shift blame and distort world events. Part Two provides a historical overview of how Tsarist Russia and the Soviet Union used this insidious technique to further their ends.\n\nThe Kremlin uses both open and hidden networks to manipulate information and spread anti-democratic, authoritarian ideologies around the world. This report focuses on Nova Resist\u00eancia, a neo-fascist, pro-authoritarian group in Brazil with close ties to U.S.-sanctioned fascist Russian philosopher Aleksandr Dugin. Nova Resist\u00eancia, its \u201csister\u201d groups of New Resistance, and its overall network use Kremlin disinformation and propaganda to attempt to destabilize democracies, engage in support for revanchist military activity through quasi-paramilitary groups, and upend the rules-based international order.\n\nThe report is also available in Portuguese and Spanish\n\nOver the year of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the Kremlin deployed a disinformation roulette of false narratives to deceive the world about the Kremlin\u2019s neo-imperial intentions and attempt to justify an unjustifiable war. The Kremlin routinely changed its false claims to distract from its battlefield failures and political isolation. From NATO \u201cencirclement\u201d and \u201cgenocide against Donbas\u201d to \u201cdenazification,\u201d to \u201cdesatanization,\u201d and \u201cdefending Russia\u2019s sovereignty,\u201d these false rhetorical contortions serve one goal \u2014 to mask Russia\u2019s apparent effort to erase the sovereign, independent state of Ukraine from the map and subjugate its people.\n\nThe Kremlin\u2019s spreading of unfounded and debunked allegations that the United States and Ukraine are conducting chemical and biological weapons activities in Ukraine is part of a well-established Russian disinformation tactic. The Kremlin has a long track record of accusing others of the very violations they commit.\n\nRussian state-owned and state-directed media, such as RT and Sputnik play a crucial role in how Russia uses disinformation to advance its foreign policy. These state-funded, and state-directed outlets disseminate Russian narratives to foreign audiences, and regularly amplify content from the other pillars of Russia\u2019s disinformation ecosystem, including websites associated with Russia\u2019s intelligence services. The State Department\u2019s Global Engagement Center\u2019s \u201cKremlin-Funded Media: RT and Sputnik\u2019s Role in Russia\u2019s Disinformation and Propaganda Ecosystem\u201d report exposes Kremlin-controlled organizations that masquerade as independent media.\n\nThe State Department\u2019s Global Engagement Center released the \u201cPillars of Russia\u2019s Disinformation and Propaganda Ecosystem\u201d report in August 2020. The report outlines the five pillars of Russia\u2019s disinformation and propaganda ecosystem and how these pillars work together to create a media multiplier effect. In particular, it details how the tactics of one pillar, proxy sources, interact with one another to elevate malicious content and create an illusion of credibility.

        "text": "French-american roadmap.\n1. Following the ceremonies of the 80th anniversary of the Normandy landings, the President of the French Republic Emmanuel Macron hosted the President of the United States Joseph R. Biden Jr. in Paris for a State visit, highlighting the deep historic ties and the shared values between France and the United States. Reflecting on their historical relationship and recalling the price for peace and freedom paid by past generations in both countries, the Presidents reaffirm their commitment to a Europe, whole, free, and at peace.\n\nUkraine\n\n2. The Presidents reaffirm their strong condemnation of Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine and reject Russia\u2019s attempted annexation of sovereign Ukrainian territory, in clear violation of international law, including the United Nations Charter. Russia\u2019s irresponsible nuclear rhetoric and disregard of arms control regimes are unacceptable. In that context, France and the United States reaffirm their continued support for Ukraine\u2019s defense of its sovereignty and territorial integrity, including through the continued provision of political, security, humanitarian, and economic assistance to Ukraine. The United States and France confirm their support for a comprehensive, just, and durable peace, respectful of international law, and will continue working with partners and allies to coordinate assistance efforts to allow Ukraine to fully exercize its right of self-defense, as reflected in Article 51 of the UN Charter.\n\n3. The Presidents discussed options to do more to support Ukraine; Euro-atlantic security as a whole is at stake in this war. France and the United States co-chair the artillery coalition at the Ukraine Defense Contact Group and intend to take new steps to provide the necessary support to Ukraine in the current phase and in the longer term. France and the United States remain determined to dispel any false notion that time is on Russia\u2019s side; the Presidents commit to support efforts within the European Union and by the G7 to bring forward the extraordinary profits from the immobilized Russian sovereign assets for the benefit of Ukraine, consistent with international law and our respective legal systems and decision- making processes.\n\n4. The Presidents also expressed strong concern about transfers of weapons, especially from Iran and Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, and dual-use materials and components for military production from businesses in the People\u2019s Republic of China and other countries, that Russia is using to rebuild its military and defense industrial base to pursue its war against Ukraine. The United States and France support actions to curtail access to the U.S. and French financial systems for those who engage in such transfers. France andthe United States share a common commitment to support the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\u2019s work to spotlight and document abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law by Russia\u2019s forces.\n\n5. The United States and France remain committed to mitigating the tragic humanitarian and human rights consequences of the war as well as its effects on global food security, energy, nuclear safety and security, and the environment.\n\nNATO\n\n6. France and the United States reaffirm their intent to defend each other and every inch of Allied territory at all times, protect their citizens, and safeguard freedom and democracy, in accordance with their commitments as NATO Allies. France and the United States are strengthening their collective defense, based on a 360-degree approach, against all threats and from all directions. The leaders reaffirmed the importance of strengthening the NATO-EU strategic partnership and promoting a stronger and more capable European defense underpinning the European pillar of transatlantic security that contributes positively to collective security. The United States supports European Allies\u2019 and partners\u2019 growing investments in military capabilities that enable our shared defense, in complementarity with NATO.\n\nMoldova, Western Balkans, and South Caucasus\n\n7. France and the United States intend to continue to work with Moldova and other partners to strengthen Moldova\u2019s resilience to Russia\u2019s destabilization attempts, diversify its energy supply, and fortify its democratic institutions and human rights protections, to advance its European integration.\n\n8. France and the United States welcomed continued close cooperation on the integration of the Western Balkans into the European Union in order to increase prosperity and fortify democratic governance and the rule of law. They welcome the opportunity to strengthen joint engagement in the Western Balkans, including through cooperation between the European Union (EU) and NATO, the EU-facilitated dialogue on the normalization of relations between Kosovo and Serbia, and by supporting key reforms for EU integration. As witness of the Dayton-Paris Agreements, France and United States reaffirm their support for the Office of the High Representative and will continue to firmly protect Bosnia and Herzegovina\u2019s sovereignty, territorial integrity, and multiethnic character. They call on leaders in Bosnia and Herzegovina to reject the path of division and secession and instead work together to make the reforms needed to join the EU. They urge the new government in North Macedonia to stay focused on the EU path and abide by their international commitments.\n\n9. The United States and France affirm their commitment to standing with the people of Georgia in their Euro-Atlantic aspirations. The Presidents urge the Georgian Dream ruling party to respect the public\u2019s wishes by returning to the Euro-Atlantic path. The United States and France support the establishment of a fair and lasting peace in the South Caucasus, based on the respect of international law as well as the principles of sovereignty, inviolability of borders and territorial integrity. They support further regional integration in the South Caucasus for the benefit of all the region\u2019s people.\n\nMiddle East\n\n10. In the Middle East, France and the United States are committed to pursue their joint efforts to de-escalate and avoid regional conflagration.11. France and the United States call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and reiterate that all hostages are to be released immediately, without preconditions. The Presidents reiterate their grave concern for the dire humanitarian crisis in Gaza, and call for the delivery of vital humanitarian aid at scale to the civilian population and unhindered and sustained humanitarian access through all routes into and inside Gaza. They also reiterate the need for Israel to do more to effectively protect Palestinian civilians and humanitarian workers. They reaffirm their commitment to a two-state solution, the only way to ensure lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians.\n\n12. They particularly underline the utmost importance of preserving the stability of Lebanon and de-escalation on the Blue Line, and will work together to reach this goal. Both countries call on all parties to exert maximum restraint and responsibility consistent with UNSCR1701. In this context, France and the United States underline the urgency to bring an end to Lebanon\u2019s 18-month long presidential vacuum and to proceed without further delay with the election of a president, the formation of a government, and the implementation of the reforms necessary to stabilize the Lebanese economy and lay the foundations for recovery and sustainable inclusive growth.\n\n13. They reaffirmed their determination to increase pressure on Iran to curb its destabilizing regional activities, nuclear escalation and missile proliferation, halt its support to Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine, secure its full cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency, and pave the way for a future negotiated solution that ensures its nuclear program is exclusively peaceful. They stand ready to adopt further sanctions and take other measures to counter Iranian destabilising activities and to prevent transfers of Iranian missiles to Russia. They also reiterate deep concern over Iran\u2019s human rights violations and abuses, especially against women, girls, and minority groups. We call on Iran\u2019s leadership to end all arbitrary detentions.\n\nAfrica\n\n14. France and the United States are committed to partnering with African countries on shared global priorities, including inclusive global economic growth, combatting the climate crisis, digital transformation, good governance and security, food security, and global health. They welcomed the African Union as a permanent member of the G20 and will work with African countries to ensure they are fully represented in international institutions. They support African partners and regional organizations in their efforts to bring peace, stability and good governance to the region, while investing in inclusive and sustainable development, human capital, and infrastructure as a key driver of economic growth.\n\n15. The United States and France are also deeply concerned by the deterioration of the governance, security, and humanitarian situation in Sudan, the Sahel, Great Lakes, and other crises. They strongly condemn ongoing human rights violations committed by multiple parties including Russian proxies as well as national armed forces, the shrinking of democratic space and rise in disinformation. France and the United States call on all belligerents in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to immediately cease hostilities, for Rwanda to withdraw and stop supporting M23, for DRC to stop any collaboration with FDLR and other armed groups, and for all actors to respect international humanitarian law. The Presidents continue to be supportive of regional diplomatic efforts and commend in particular the mediation led by the President of Angola, and call on all parties to de-escalate, protect civilian populations, and participate constructively in dialogue to create conditions for a negotiated solution leading to a lasting peace. The Presidents commit to consulting on their respective approaches in Western Africa, including in the Sahel. The United States and France are committed to advancing mediation efforts to find a political solution to theSudan crisis as well as to support increased, sustained and vital humanitarian assistance to the Sudanese population.\n\nIndo-Pacific\n\n16. The United States and France are strengthening their cooperation in the Indo-Pacific to advance prosperity, security, and universal values based on a rules-based international order, transparent governance, fair economic practices, and respect for international law, including freedom of navigation. In line with their shared commitment to the security and stability of the region and building on their comparative advantages, the United States and France also aim to expand concrete cooperation in areas such as maritime security, humanitarian assistance and disaster response, climate, biodiversity, and sustainable ocean management. The Presidents recall and fully support G7 statements on PRC and will closely coordinate on the different challenges related to PRC\u2019s measures and policies.\n\n17. Regarding the DPRK, they continue to strongly condemn the DPRK\u2019s provision of ballistic missiles and munitions to Russia for use in Ukraine and, they will coordinate their efforts in the UNSC on all DPRK related issues. They reaffirmed their support for the people of Myanmar in their quest for peace, freedom, and democracy. The United States and France are deepening their regional diplomatic, development, and economic engagement, including with regional institutions like ASEAN, the Pacific Islands Forum, and the Indian Ocean Rim Association, to support prosperity and security and the transition to sustainable renewable energy in Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, South Asia, and across the Indo- Pacific region.\n\nWestern Hemisphere\n\n18. The United States and France are supporting the swift deployment of the United Nations Security Council authorized Multinational Security Support mission to Haiti and thank Kenya for leading this critical mission.

        "text": "After two years, Trump returns to Arizona with a new partner in campaigning\nAfter two years, Trump returns to Arizona with a new partner in campaigning\n\ntoggle caption Caitlin O'Hara for NPR\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has largely been absent in Arizona \u2014 limited staffing and no advertisements. On Thursday, he returned to the Grand Canyon state after nearly two years to back up on-the-ground organizing from outside groups.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump held a town hall event sponsored by Turning Point Action, which focuses on mobilizing young conservatives, at Dream City Church in Phoenix. To a chanting crowd of thousands, Trump vowed to make his voter mobilization efforts this cycle \u201ctoo big to rig.\u201d\n\nThis is a nod at his false claim that the 2020 election was stolen. Those false claims began in Arizona. And the state really became the center for election denialism theories and claims.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe event also underscores a new campaign tactic: directly using outside organizations to lead canvassing efforts to turn out voters. Trump\u2019s presence in the state, his first this cycle, is seen as an endorsement of Turning Point\u2019s new \u201cChase the Vote\u201d initiative. The townhall also comes days after the trump campaign and the Republican National Committee announced a \u201cSwamp the Vote\u201d initiative that promotes early and mail-in voting.\n\n\u201cWe are going to make November too big to rig and we are going to overwhelm the ballot boxes,\u201d said Charlie Kirk, the founder and executive director of Turning Point USA, during the event doubling down that \u201cthere is no path to the White House without Arizona.\u201d \u201cWe are going to out register them, we are going to out work them.\u201d\n\ntoggle caption Caitlin O'Hara for NPR\n\nArizona is one of the six key swing states that could determine the outcome of the presidential election. In 2020, Trump lost the state to President Biden by just over 11,000 votes. That was the first time the state had voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since Bill Clinton in 1996. Before Clinton, the most recent Democrat to win was Harry Truman in 1948. But despite being a traditionally Republican state, political consultants say the effort on the Trump campaign\u2019s part is still needed.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cIt's really a base motivational visit to make sure that people in Arizona, his team in Arizona know that he cares,\u201d said Chuck Coughlin, CEO of HighGround, a political consulting firm in Arizona. \u201cThey\u2019ve got to feel his confidence in order to be mobilized and engaged in this cycle.\n\n\u201cAnd that's not the case right now \u2014 you can definitely feel it because he has not been out here,\u201d he added.\n\nTrump\u2019s absence has been notable. The former president was scheduled to attend the AZ GOP\u2019s annual dinner in January but the event was canceled following news of the chairman\u2019s resignation. There were also plans for him to visit in March and May \u2014 both of which did not come to fruition and he went to Ohio and stayed in New York instead.\n\n\u201cThere were preliminary discussions about potential visits that were never finalized due to scheduling conflicts,\u201d a campaign official confirmed.\n\nHis investment in the state has also been minimal. In 2020, Trump spent more than $2 million on advertisements between Jan. 1 and June 6. So far in 2024, he has not spent any money at all, according to an NPR analysis of data from AdImpact, which tracks ad spending.\n\nStepping into a part of that void is Turning Point Action. Speaking at Dream City Church, Kirk called on supporters to convince their fellow conservatives to turn out to vote \u2014 blaming low turnout and mobilization on recent state losses for the party.\n\ntoggle caption Caitlin O'Hara for NPR\n\nThe Arizona GOP said they did not have a response to NPR requests for comment on the strategy. Turning Point has previously faced criticism in conservative circles not not successfully helping candidates win general elections even in their home state of Arizona. Still, Kirk is trying to position the group to supplant the broader GOP apparatus.\n\n\u201cI am asking you to download an app, to talk to your neighbors, to go fill in a piece of paper, chase a couple ballots, and own your neighborhood and save this country,\u201d Kirk said to the cheering crowd, doubling down that if \u201cpeople need a job because of the Biden economy\u201d he will hire them now to be \u201cballot chasers.\u201d\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe group is working to create an organizing effort to support Trump in Arizona, Wisconsin and Michigan. Their goal is to raise $100 million and hire \u201cballot chasers\u201d to door knock, canvass, register voters and encourage people to vote whether its in person or by mail.\n\nSo far, they have raised \u201ctens of millions of dollars,\u201d have hired \u201chundreds of staff\u201d and are \u201conboarding 20 to 40 new staffers every other week,\u201d according to Andrew Kolvet, spokesperson for Turning Point Action.\n\n\u201cTo have the president come out to Arizona to do the event with Turning Point Action to endorse this project,\u201d Kolvet said, acknowledging that this is the first time Trump comes through the state this cycle. \u201cIt's a watershed moment for the movement to have President Trump be the special guest for this.\u201d\n\ntoggle caption Caitlin O'Hara for NPR\n\nTrump campaign and Turning Point Action are coordinating on the canvassing efforts, Kolvet said, due to a recent advisory opinion made by the Federal Election Commission allows campaigns to coordinate with outside groups on canvassing.\n\n\u201cTrump's coalition demands that low propensity voters are paid proper attention to. These are not necessarily politically active people, but they support the president and they support the conservative agenda,\u201d Kolvet said. \u201cAnd so we have to do our part as a movement to make sure that we're getting those people out to the polls and that is a huge paradigm shift on the conservative side.\u201d\n\nCoughlin, the Arizona-based consultant, also sees how Trump is using Turning Point Action as the emerging dominant organizing force in Arizona.\n\n\u201cIt is that organizational ability that does not exist in this cycle inside the GOP,\u201d Coughlin said. \u201cAnd Turning Point is presenting themselves as an alternative organizational front to be able to do those voter ID and turnout activities.\u201d\n\nWhen thinking about the 11,000 vote margin Trump lost by last election, Kolvet believes his efforts could make the difference this time.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cTurning Point seems to be at a place where it can marshal resources and human assets to help a campaign,\u201d Coughlin said. \u201cWhereas the GOP is not.\u201d",

        "text": "Voting in Harmony: A Wisconsin township sets itself apart and has a knack for picking winners\nHARMONY, Wis. (AP) \u2014 It\u2019s hard living in harmony during these politically divisive times.\n\nBut residents of a tiny Wisconsin town say they have the simple answer: actually live in Harmony.\n\nResidents of Harmony Township \u2014 spread out on rich farmland and residential subdivisions on the outskirts of Janesville \u2014 tend to live up to the name of the 24-square-mile town near the Illinois state line. They also offer a reliable barometer of the political leanings of the swing state of Wisconsin.\n\nSince 2000, Harmony voters have sided with the winner in all 13 presidential and gubernatorial races.\n\n\u201cI do believe that the country is quite divided,\u201d said town board Chair Jeff Klenz, sporting a long white goatee and wearing a Harley-Davidson T-shirt. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that same thing in Harmony Township. You don\u2019t get the feeling of people being against each other.\u201d\n\nKlenz repeats a saying heard frequently around the town of 2,500: \u201cEverybody lives in harmony in Harmony Township.\u201d\n\nDemographically, Harmony has the same percentage of white people as the state \u2014 about 86%. Almost 12% identified of Harmony residents identified as multiracial, above the statewide average of 2.2%. But there\u2019s no Black population to speak of, in a state that\u2019s 6% Black, according to the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s American Community Survey.\n\nStill, given Wisconsin\u2019s recent political volatility, Harmony\u2019s knack for picking winners is uncanny. Four of the past six presidential elections in the swing state of Wisconsin have been decided by less than a point. The only other of Wisconsin\u2019s 1,800 towns, villages and cities that share the distinction is Merrimac, a village of about 500 people roughly 75 miles (121 kilometers) from Madison, according to research by Marquette University professor John D. Johnson.\n\nWhat to know about Trump\u2019s second term:\n\nStaffing the administration: Here are the people Trump has picked recess appointments Follow all of our coverage as Donald Trump assembles his second administration.\n\nDonald Trump carried the town of Harmony by just 36 votes in 2016 on his way to winning Wisconsin by 22,748 votes and becoming the first Republican since Ronald Reagan to take the state. Four years later, President Joe Biden won the town by 78 votes and carried Wisconsin by just under 20,682 votes.\n\nRetired General Motors worker and 53-year Harmony resident Loren Hanson, 79, voted for Trump in both 2016 and 2020 but doesn\u2019t know if he can stick with him a third time this November. He\u2019s having a hard time coming to grips with Trump\u2019s felony conviction.\n\n\u201cI think our politics are a mess, quite frankly,\u201d Hanson said. \u201cAnd really bad this year. I\u2019ve never been a solid Republican or Democrat. And sometimes you vote for the lesser of two evils, and this year I don\u2019t know which is which.\u201d\n\nHanson said he\u2019s hesitating on Trump because of his personal troubles, calling him an \u201coutlaw.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would be really hard for me to vote for Mr. Trump right now,\u201d he said, referring to his hush money conviction.\n\nBut Hanson has reservations about Biden as well.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s old,\u201d Hanson said. \u201cHe\u2019s got some problems this way or that. Personally, I\u2019d like to see both of them booted out and I\u2019m disappointed that the parties can\u2019t come up with someone younger.\u201d\n\nKlenz, a 68-year-old retired police officer, said after voting for Trump twice before, he\u2019s sticking with him despite the conviction.\n\n\u201cBeing in law enforcement for over 30 years, I never had a problem with our judicial system, but as I\u2019ve gotten older and maybe wiser, I\u2019ve seen that we certainly do have some problems,\u201d Klenz said. He said the Trump conviction showed that the judicial system \u201chas been used really different than it should be used.\u201d\n\nDespite the deep divisions in Harmony, both Republicans and Democrats say they don\u2019t let politics drive how they treat one another.\n\n\u201cThere are roots here that go down very deeply and they are roots of acceptance, respect and cooperation,\u201d said 85-year-old retired nurse and Biden voter Lucille Vickerman, seated next to Trump voter Klenz.\n\n\u201cWe vote almost half and half,\u201d Vickerman said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t hate each other. We don\u2019t get into massive to-dos.\u201d\n\nBut why?\n\nFor starters, people talk to one another to understand where the other is coming from, Klenz said.\n\nPolitics isn\u2019t a driving force in Harmony \u201cbecause most of the people around here are used to taking care of themselves,\u201d Klenz said.\n\nAnd when people do talk, it doesn\u2019t tend to be about national politics, Vickerman said.\n\n\u201cThey talk about what\u2019s going on in the school system or what\u2019s going on with the road repair,\u201d she said.\n\nTown clerk Tim Tollefson, whose job is to run elections, said politics just doesn\u2019t divide people in Harmony the way it seems to in much of the rest of the state and country.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think people take that part of politics and put it into whether people can be friends or not,\u201d Tollefson said. \u201cThe signs out in the yard? You don\u2019t see that many in Harmony Township.\u201d\n\nVickerman said she was struck last fall after seeing a plethora of signs, including some painted on the sides of barns, during a drive through northern Wisconsin.\n\n\u201cComing from here it was a little unnerving, to be honest,\u201d she said.\n\nHanson said he avoids talking politics in Harmony \u201cbecause I have friends on both sides and some are pretty extreme.\u201d\n\nHarmony is in southeastern Wisconsin, about a 15-minute drive from the Illinois border. It consists of farms that the town boasts are on \u201csome of the best farmland in the U.S.\u201d and houses built by people who work in the adjacent city of Janesville.\n\nThat\u2019s the home to former House Speaker Paul Ryan and also the former home of the country\u2019s oldest General Motors plant, built in 1919.\n\nBut when the plant shut down during the Great Recession in 2008, the city and region went through an economic and social upheaval, forced to readjust without a longtime major employer.\n\nHarmony was established in 1848, the same year Wisconsin became a state. It carries the distinction of being one of the first in the country to construct its own town hall building.\n\nBuilt in 1876, the building was moved about 30 miles northeast and is now part of the living history museum Old World Wisconsin.\n\nCoincidentally, the presidential election in 1876, the year Harmony residents set about building their town hall, was one of the most contentious in U.S. history. Taking place during post-Civil War reconstruction, there were widespread allegations of electoral fraud, violence and disenfranchisement of Black voters.\n\nRutherford B. Hayes won Wisconsin by 6,141 votes, or just over 2 percentage points, in 1876.\n\nThere are parallels between that period and the present day, including \u201cintense polarization with a shrinking kind of middle ground and a high level of rhetorical violence,\u201d said Stephen Kantrowitz, a history professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who specializes in the reconstruction era.\n\nIn this time of deep division, Kantrowitz said it was \u201cwonderful\u201d that both sides in a place as evenly divided as Harmony can get along.\n\nBut the larger question, he said, is what happens when communities like Harmony are presented with questions that cut to the heart of people\u2019s sense of security, dignity and fairness.\n\n\u201cIt sounds like Harmony is not in the middle of such a struggle,\u201d he said. \u201cIt behooves the people who say politics aren\u2019t top of mind to think about what they will do when suddenly an issue arises that is not so easily finesse-able.\u201d\n\nVickerman, who moved to Harmony in 1960 when Dwight D. Eisenhower was president, didn\u2019t vote in 2016. But she cast her ballot for Biden in 2020. This year she\u2019s soured on him and Trump: \u201cI wish neither of them was running.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a Biden fan but I can\u2019t bring myself to be a Trump fan,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m fearful that Trump will refuse to leave office if elected. There\u2019s a part of me that does worry about our democracy surviving.\u201d\n\nKlenz voted for Trump in both 2016 and 2020 and said he will vote for him again. He thinks the Republican is better on the economy than Biden.\n\nAnd true to form for people from Harmony, Klenz adds, \u201cI\u2019m not too concerned with how other people are voting.\u201d\n\nTollefson, who has lived in Harmony since 1998, said other communities can learn from how people there deal with political differences.\n\n\u201cChill out,\u201d he said. \u201cDeal with the cards you were dealt and be happy. We\u2019re only here a short time. Why waste your time being miserable?\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Michael Schneider in Orlando, Florida, contributed to this report.",

        "text": "Alito neighbor gives detailed account of 'nasty' dispute that became national news\nAlito neighbor gives detailed account of 'nasty' dispute that became national news\n\ntoggle caption Marissa Leshnov for NPR\n\nA liberal former neighbor of conservative Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito is publicly offering her account of a series of tense interactions she had with Alito\u2019s wife, Martha-Ann, around the time of the 2020 presidential election and the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.\n\nThe saga began as a dispute over anti-Trump lawn signs and culminated in a profanity-filled confrontation on the street, which Justice Alito witnessed.\n\n\u201cThis was one of the craziest things I've ever experienced in my life,\u201d said the neighbor, Emily Baden, in an interview with NPR. \u201cThe power imbalance between these people and myself is huge. Like it literally couldn't get any bigger.\u201d\n\nSponsor Message\n\nJustice Alito has cited that neighborhood dispute as the context for the upside-down American flag that flew in front of his home in Northern Virginia in the days after the Capitol riot.\n\nSailors have historically used the upside-down flag as a symbol of distress. More recently, the upside-down American flag also became associated with the pro-Trump \u201cstop the steal\u201d movement and efforts to keep the former president in power. Some Trump supporters carried upside-down flags at the Jan. 6 riot. Because of that association, Democrats have called for Alito to recuse himself from cases related to Trump and the insurrection.\n\nAlito has rejected those arguments and said his wife alone \u2014 over Justice Alito\u2019s objections \u2014 raised the upside-down flag after the argument with Baden.\n\n\u201cMy wife\u2019s reasons for flying the flag are not relevant for present purposes,\u201d Alito wrote to Democratic members of Congress, \u201cbut I note that she was greatly distressed at the time due, in large part, to a very nasty neighborhood dispute in which I had no involvement.\u201d\n\nHe said that his wife was also solely responsible for displaying another flag, known as the \u201cAppeal to Heaven,\u201d at the Alito\u2019s beach house in New Jersey. That flag dates back to the American Revolution and, in more recent years, has also been embraced by some far-right religious conservatives. \u201cMy wife is fond of flying flags,\u201d Alito wrote. \u201cI am not.\u201d\n\ntoggle caption Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP\n\nBaden told NPR that Alito\u2019s explanation for the upside-down flag is \u201cludicrous\u201d and does not match the timeline of the neighborhood dispute. Baden acknowledges that she called Martha-Ann Alito the \u201cc-word\u201d on the street during one encounter, which she says Martha-Ann Alito initiated. But she notes that the incident took place weeks after the upside-down flag was raised in front of the Alito residence, according to reporting from the New York Times, which broke the story.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe Supreme Court did not respond to NPR\u2019s request for comment.\n\n\n\nA series of increasingly heated encounters\n\nBaden and her husband (then boyfriend) moved in to her mother\u2019s home in northern Virginia in 2020, after the COVID-19 pandemic forced her to stop working as an actor and restaurant server in New York.\n\nBaden describes herself as a \u201cleftist,\u201d but says she initially did not think much about the Alitos down the street. The Alito house is farther down the cul-de-sac, and not visible from her mother\u2019s front yard.\n\nAfter Joe Biden was declared the winner of the 2020 presidential election, Baden celebrated and put up a handmade sign in the yard. On one side it said \u201cBYE-DON,\u201d and on the other \u201cF*** Trump.\u201d\n\nOne day, Baden says, the wind blew the sign down. According to Baden, Martha-Ann Alito happened to drive by and thanked Baden for taking the sign down. But Baden had no intention of leaving the sign down.\n\n\u201cI say, \u2018I'm going to keep the sign up. Thank you. Bye.\u2019 Or something like that. And that was it,\u201d she says.\n\nAfter the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Baden put up a new sign stating, \u201cYou are complicit\u201d and \u201cTrump Is A Fascist.\u201d\n\nThe following day, Baden says she and her husband were sitting in their car parked in front of her mother\u2019s house, when someone drove up next to them.\n\ntoggle caption Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images\n\n\u201cThe person inside just stares at us, just glares at us,\u201d Baden says. \u201cAnd I was just sitting there, like, thinking to myself, \u2018oh, my God, that's that's Mrs. Alito. That's her.\u2019 And she's stopped there for a period of time that feels like forever and then drives off.\u201d\n\n\u201cI texted some friends like, \u2018You guys will never believe what just happened. I'm so weirded out right now,\u2019\u201d she says.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAbout a week or so later, according to the New York Times, the upside-down American flag started flying in front of the Alitos\u2019 house. Baden says she never saw it.\n\nThen, on Jan. 20, 2021, Joe Biden was set to be inaugurated as president. Baden says she and her husband decided to drive by the Alito home out of curiosity.\n\n\u201cI don't know if I expected to see anything or what I expected to see,\u201d she says.\n\nBaden says Martha Ann-Alito happened to be in front of the house.\n\n\u201cAnd she sees us and runs out to the street and she's yelling something and we don't hear it,\u201d Baden says. \u201cOur windows are up and we're in motion. So we don't hear what she's yelling.\u201d\n\nThe street is a cul-de-sac, which meant Baden and her husband had to turn around and pass by the Alito home a second time.\n\n\u201cAnd we see in our rearview mirror that she, like, spits at our car, or it looks like she spat at our car and then we just got the hell out of there,\u201d Baden says. In Baden\u2019s account, Alito was not close enough to the car to make any contact.\n\nThe final \u2013 and most heated \u2013 encounter between Baden and the Alitos took place on Feb. 15, 2021.\n\n\u201cMy husband and I are just in the driveway. We're getting the trash cans. And then the Alitos\u201d - both Justice Alito and Martha-Ann Alito - \u201cwalk up, they presumably were just taking a walk.\u201d\n\nBaden says she and her husband were startled to see them.\n\n\u201cAnd then then Mrs. Alito says something like, \u2018well, well, well, if it isn't the the f****** fascists, Emily and my husband's name and my mom's name, you're - you're a f****** fascist.\u2019\u201d\n\nBaden says she was surprised to hear Martha-Ann Alito use each of their full names. Baden had never introduced herself by name, and she and her husband were not yet married and did not share a last name.\n\ntoggle caption Marissa Leshnov for NPR\n\n\u201cAnd that was when I spoke back,\u201d Baden says. \u201cI just said, like, \u2018How dare you behave this way? You represent the highest court in the land. What are you doing? I'm a stranger to you. This is because of my sign? That's insane.\u2019\u201d\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBaden acknowledges that she called Martha-Ann Alito the \u201cc-word.\u201d\n\nAlito described the use of \u201cfoul language\u201d in his letter, and the \u201cvilest epithet that can be addressed to a woman.\u201d\n\nBaden told NPR she now regrets using the word.\n\n\u201cThey're choosing to harass and intimidate us when we are nothing to them. We're just random people,\u201d Baden says. \u201cSo that would have been the message that I wanted to convey. And, you know, and if a curse word cheapened that somehow, then, yeah, I would say that I regretted saying it.\u201d\n\nBaden says Justice Alito remained silent throughout the entire encounter. As Baden yelled, the Alitos walked away.\n\n\u201cMr. Alito is walking away much quicker,\u201d she remembered. \u201che really got out of there.\u201d\n\nSoon after, Baden\u2019s husband called the police and recorded the call. She shared the recording with NPR. The officer who answered told them that there was nothing he could do after the fact, but said that he would call the Alitos\u2019 protective detail.\n\nHe told Baden\u2019s husband to call the police again if there was another incident. But Baden says that was the last time that the Alitos and Baden encountered each other.\n\n\u201cMy wife is a private citizen, and she possesses the same First Amendment rights as every other American,\u201d Alito wrote in his letter to Congress. \u201cShe makes her own decisions, and I have always respected her right to do so.\u201d\n\n",

She says she compares that to foreign countries like Israel that have seen billions of dollars in U.S. aid.\n\n\u201cA lot of our family members lost their homes and were never let back in, and a lot of family members were displaced,\u201d she said.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nSo, even if she may not love everything about Trump, she says she thinks she\u2019ll vote for him again.\n\n\u201cJust because our economy and the future of our economy, not because of what he says or the things he says,\u201d she said.\n\nAmong the produce and homemade goods, conspiracy theories were also on the table from many voters, including Santana. It\u2019s fueled by their anger and confusion about decisions made by the country\u2019s leaders.\n\n\u201cI feel like COVID was a coverup for all of that, they were like, \u2018Oh what can we do to manipulate the people and to bring change upon them, oh make them all stay at home,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nA few feet away, customer Shack Kaspershackelford was puzzled by Trump voters. She says she\u2019d never vote for him.\n\n\u201cNo, no, absolutely not. Zero out of 10,\u201d she said.\n\nKaspershackelford, a technician at Allegiant Stadium, is also 23 years old and shares Santana\u2019s housing frustration. She is also living with her parents.\n\nBut she says she\u2019s still leaning toward Biden even as many of her relatives back Trump.\n\n\u201cI have a lot of family members who do like him,\u201d she said.\n\nKaspershackelford said she voted for Biden in the last election and generally wants more left-leaning candidates. She says she\u2019s most concerned about the U.S. getting pulled into a new, international war.\n\nShe\u2019s also worried about the economy, social issues and immigration.\n\nShe admits she\u2019s not thrilled about Biden and wants to see more from him.\n\n\u201cI think he's definitely done some decent work over the last four years,\u201d she said. \u201cI just feel like it's maybe not enough. I haven't heard too much about stuff he's really gotten done or his policies, and I would prefer somebody a bit more left, but also, like, if that's what we've got, that's what we have, you know?\u201d\n\n\n\nSponsor Message\n\nHousing concerns driving anger\n\nAbout 30 miles away at an early voting site in northwest Las Vegas, Keri Cervantez was trying to get the word out on her favorite local candidates.\n\nCervantez is a fifth-generation Las Vegas native who says three of her four adult sons have moved back into her home because they couldn\u2019t find anything affordable. The retiree says it\u2019s the sign of a weak economy \u2014 and blames Biden.\n\n\u201cI mean, I see more and more my neighbors have their kids living with them,\u201d Cervantez said from the Thunderbird Family Sports Complex. \u201cAnd because they can't afford it, you know, they'll never be able, at this rate, afford a home.\u201d\n\nHer son Sean, who has worked as a physical therapist, agrees.\n\n\u201cThat's what keeps me up at night is not being able to to know that I don't have a way to protect my family, how to take care of my family. And it's rough, you know, and I think that's one of the biggest things that my generation is looking at.\u201d\n\nSean Cervantez and his mom both voted for Trump in the last election.\n\nConspiracy theories resurface when he begins talking about the voting machines in 2020 and how the technology can\u2019t be trusted.\n\nSean says he\u2019s so disenchanted with the whole process, he may not vote at all this year.",

        "text": "\u2018Georgia Is Our Laboratory\u2019: Inside Trump\u2019s Plan to Rig 2024\nT he presidential election this year will come down to seven states \u2014 but there\u2019s one that Donald Trump and his most committed lieutenants see as a blueprint for corrupting future local and national elections: Georgia.\n\nThe Peach State is unique \u2014 it\u2019s the sole battleground state in which the Republican Party has total control over the levers of power: a trifecta in the state House, Senate, and governorship. Over the past four years, Trump-loving elements of the Georgia GOP have wielded that advantage in a crusade to convert discredited election-conspiracy theories into policies well ahead of Election Day 2024. It is an alarmingly anti-democratic experiment that Trumpland and much of the GOP hope to take national.\n\n\u201cGeorgia is our laboratory,\u201d a source close to the former president tells Rolling Stone. \u201cIf you can get this up and running in Georgia, you get a road map for other states, maybe the country as a whole.\u201d\n\nIn 2020, top Georgia Republicans such as Gov. Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger managed to block Trump\u2019s attempts to illegally overturn the election results. Kemp earned Trump\u2019s fury by refusing to use what the then-president called \u201cemergency powers\u201d to stop the certification of Joe Biden\u2019s victory. In an infamous January 2021 phone call that helped lead to Trump\u2019s indictment in Fulton County, Raffensperger rebuffed the president\u2019s demands to \u201cfind\u201d him votes. Kemp and Raffensperger both won handily in their 2022 reelection runs.\n\nBut ever since President Biden\u2019s inauguration, conservative activists and policymakers in Georgia have tried to bypass Raffensperger and worked diligently to turn Trump\u2019s heads-I-win-tails-you-lose philosophy of elections into public policy.\n\nAs Trump has continued to lie that the 2020 election was \u201cstolen\u201d and \u201crigged\u201d , the former president and his supporters have been making concrete, step-by-step progress in shaping electoral processes to his benefit. Across the state, MAGA die-hards are devoting considerable resources to purging voter rolls, intimidating election officials, employing legal dirty tricks, and ousting Republican officials and election appointees who haven\u2019t been initiated into the cult of Trump. Editor\u2019s picks\n\nRepublican operatives have remade Georgia\u2019s state election board, executive branch, Legislature, and legal ecosystems, all in Donald Trump\u2019s image. Conservatives in the state Assembly have unleashed thousands of voter eligibility challenges on county election boards \u2014 an effort that will be turbocharged with a new election law. Lawmakers also worked to limit Raffensperger\u2019s role in overseeing elections, while sapping resources for election administration.\n\nConservative activists heckle election officials on a regular basis with the conspiracy theories Trump birthed, and an indicted election denier \u2014 now the state\u2019s lieutenant governor \u2014 pushes Trump\u2019s agenda in the Assembly as he eyes higher office. Trump sits atop this sprawling network, receiving updates on progress from political advisers and other MAGA acolytes.\n\nLawyers close to Trump are already preparing for the former president to claim fraud in Georgia and challenge the results of the election \u2014 even in the event that he wins \u2014 just to prove a point about imaginary \u201cfraud\u201d in Democratic areas. \u201cThere\u2019s massive fraud, so that should be \u2026 solved, no matter who wins in Georgia or any state,\u201d says one lawyer and conservative-movementarian who has discussed the matter with Trump, although they present no evidence to back such claims. \u201cYou can\u2019t let the left get away with it just because their cheating did not work.\u201d\n\nNone of this may be necessary. If the election were held today, polls suggest Trump would win Georgia outright. But to the Trump faithful, that is almost beside the point. In the past four years, Trump and his allies have been doing everything they can to make sure that a Republican defeat in Georgia simply cannot happen again \u2014 and to entrench a permanent GOP majority in a deeply divided state. Related Content\n\nIt\u2019s happening throughout the country: Nearly every leader who matters in various state GOPs, the national Republican Party, and within the conservative movement is playing part in a well-funded, coordinated attempt to corrupt American elections in a way so transparently cynical, so authoritarian, that it makes the right\u2019s \u201cvoter fraud\u201d crackdowns of the pre-Trump era look like a flicker of intellectual calm by comparison.\n\nIn Georgia, with Election Day just months away, the effects of these Trump-backed initiatives can be felt in every corner of the state\u2019s political environment, from the governor\u2019s mansion to the local election officials increasingly facing threats and intimidation, all the way down to the everyday residents who are forced by conservative activists to defend their right to vote.\n\nAn audio recording of former President Donald Trump speaking to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger is played during a hearing of the House Select Committee in 2022. Kent Nishimura/\u201dLos Angeles Times\u201d/Getty Images\n\n\u201cThe effort to suppress the vote in Georgia happens year-round, and the countereffort needs to be equally, if not more, robust,\u201d says Saira Draper, a Democratic state representative who worked on voter-protection issues for the Biden campaign in 2020. \u201cInstead of investing in voter protection only in big election years, Democrats need to be at the forefront of defending democracy every day, and for every election.\u201d\n\nWith both the Biden and Trump presidential campaigns privately bracing for an extraordinarily close election in November \u2014 and a possible protracted legal battle in the aftermath \u2014 any minor change at the margins on either side could help make the difference between a Trump victory or loss in the state. And Trump and Georgia Republicans have made it abundantly clear they aren\u2019t willing to leave the electoral outcome up to chance.\n\n\u201cEverybody is gearing up for full-blown warfare,\u201d says a Republican source close to Trump who has worked on \u201celection integrity\u201d efforts. \u201cThe campaign, the RNC, everyone is going to be fighting Biden\u2019s team over every single inch, and each bit of process.\u201d\n\nIN THE WAKE of Trump\u2019s loss and record-breaking voter turnout in 2020, Republicans enacted a series of sweeping laws to suppress the vote.\n\nSB 202, the \u201cElection Integrity Act,\u201d passed in 2021, restricted early voting and ballot drop boxes and limited mail-in-ballots. It also made it illegal to provide water or food to people waiting in line to vote. And it limited the secretary of state\u2019s role on the state election board \u2014 a move to punish Raffensperger. Despite the bad blood between Trump and Kemp, the Georgia governor signed the bill, dubbed \u201cJim Crow in the 21st century \u201d by Biden, into law.\n\nPerhaps most important, the law massively expanded the number of challenges that activists can file contesting the validity of voter registrations in their county \u2014 opening up more voters to pernicious nuisance challenges to their right to vote. MAGA activists have flooded the state with tens of thousands of baseless voter-eligibility claims.\n\nEverybody is gearing up for full-blown warfare.\n\n\u2014Republican source close to Trump\n\nOne Fulton County resident had her voter registration challenged by a third party on the suspicion that she had listed an invalid address, despite living at the same home since 2011. Atlanta\u2019s mayor and city council moved unanimously in 2018 to change the name of her street, as part of an effort to rid the city of its Confederate iconography. Thanks to Georgia Republicans, that street-name change was used as a rationale to try to disenfranchise her.\n\n\u201cI just feel like this is a waste of my time and also my kids\u2019 time,\u201d she told county officials at a 2023 hearing. \u201cI\u2019m here when I have other things to do,\u201d she said. \u201cI have a job.\u201d\n\nMany challengers rely on data from a website known as VoteRef. The site is a subsidiary of Restoration Action Inc., an election-denial group backed by the billionaire Trump donor and cardboard-box magnate Richard Uihlein.\n\nVoteRef purports to offer a user-friendly interface for aggregated government voter-registration data. But Kristin Nabers, the state director for the nonprofit voting-rights group All Voting Is Local, says the site \u201cis using a voter roll for Georgia from November 2022. It\u2019s a year-and-a-half-old voter roll that is massively out of date. The secretary of state did a list cleanup in 2023, none of which is reflected on VoteRef. These sites are just not reliable.\u201d\n\nThe wave of voter challenges has been exacerbated by new rules in how the state funds its elections. For years, election officials in Georgia and around the country have benefited from grants and donations from private foundations. Now, just as county election boards grapple with the overwhelming weight of mass challenges, officials will have fewer resources available to manage them. Last year, Republicans made Georgia one of the first states to ban private charitable contributions for election administration in 2024.\n\nThe move was part of a nationwide campaign by MAGA activists to block those donations, which they call \u201cZuckerbucks,\u201d based on the prominent role of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg in funding nonpartisan election-support charities. \u201cI consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people\u201d for Zuckerberg\u2019s role in funding election-administration charities, Trump told CNBC in March.\n\nCounty election boards have dismissed most of the challenges resulting from SB 202. However, a Republican law that Kemp signed in early May offers new guidance to county election boards, and could lead to more voter-registration challenges being upheld on thin evidence before the 2024 election.\n\nUnder the National Voter Registration Act, states are required to finish cleaning their voter rolls 90 days before federal elections. The new Georgia law, however, sets its moratorium on registration challenges at 45 days before an election \u2014 which some experts argue is a violation of the NVRA.\n\n\u201cThe 45-day quiet period is trying to bypass the 90-day quiet period the NVRA has. You don\u2019t have a quiet period unless what you\u2019re trying to do is list maintenance under another name. That gives away the game right there,\u201d one Georgia election official says. The official adds that with the new law, \u201cif a voter gets caught up in a challenge, they are never going to get the opportunity to reregister if they were inappropriately removed.\u201d\n\nTo the former president, however, these voter-suppression laws do not go far enough. During his time out of office, Trump has noted to close advisers that while the state\u2019s voting overhaul does \u201csome nice things,\u201d the changes won\u2019t matter unless, in Trump\u2019s words, \u201cyou get the fucking RINOs out of the way,\u201d according to a source with direct knowledge of the ex-president\u2019s opinions on the matter.\n\nAS REPUBLICANS HAVE overloaded local election boards with frivolous voter challenges, they have also worked to reshape the state board overseeing elections \u2014 and make it more MAGA.\n\nTrump has played a key role here, behind the scenes. Ed Lindsey, a Republican member of the state election board, landed in the former president\u2019s crosshairs after he opposed an end to no-excuse mail-in voting, which allows registered voters to submit their ballot by mail without providing a reason.\n\nIn recent months, Trump spent time calling Georgia lawmakers and fellow MAGA hard-liners in the state to ask them about Lindsey and to demand that he be shown the door, somehow. \u201cHe\u2019s got to go,\u201d Trump said privately, noting Lindsey\u2019s position on the \u201cvery important\u201d election board, according to two sources familiar with the matter.\n\nLindsey\u2019s vote against recommending that the Legislature curb voting by mail was just one in a series of moves that infuriated the MAGA activists who have become influential in the state party. He also took a hard line on the bogus claims of election fraud made by the conspiracy nonprofit True the Vote, which recently had to admit in federal court that it had no evidence for voter-fraud claims it had put before the board of elections.\n\nLindsey\u2019s principles did not sit well with the MAGA movement, which sprang into action. The DeKalb County Republican Party demanded Lindsey\u2019s resignation, claiming newfound conflicts of interest on his part. That position was echoed by a host of conservative media outlets and at least one think tank with ties to Trump.\n\nThe final straw came in May. At a meeting of the state election board, Lindsey refused to join calls for the Georgia attorney general to investigate Fulton County\u2019s audit of the 2020 election \u2014 long a rallying cry for election deniers.\n\nOn May 15, the far-right activists got their wish when Lindsey abruptly resigned his post on the state election board. Republican state House Speaker Jon Burns announced that he would replace Lindsey with Janelle King, a Republican media pundit in Georgia who supported Trump in 2020 and said on her podcast that she is \u201cagainst no-excuse\u201d voting by mail.\n\nLindsey, a holdover appointment from the previous speaker, had already served a term on the board and expressed a willingness to continue serving throughout the 2024 election, or until Burns found a replacement for him, according to a copy of his resignation letter obtained by Rolling Stone.\n\nIn the letter to Burns, which came shortly after the contentious May election-board meeting, Lindsey indicated that the speaker prompted his exit: \u201cIn our talk yesterday, you informed me that you have found someone to appoint and wish to do so this week.\u201d\n\nIn an email to friends and colleagues announcing his departure, also obtained by Rolling Stone, Lindsey revealed the pressure the state\u2019s election officials will face, including from conspiracy theorists, in the upcoming election. \u201cTogether they must not only be strong and diligent enough to root out those who wish to cheat the system through fraud or suppression, but also wise and judicious enough to identify, expose, and call out others who cynically spread false claims of the same for cheap personal or partisan gain,\u201d he wrote.\n\nDonald J. Trump, in 2020, listens as Atlanta small business owner Janelle King delivers remarks during the \u2018Rebuilding of AmericaOs Infrastructure: Faster, Better, Stronger\u2019 event. Storms Media Group/Alamy\n\nThe move to implement a more MAGA elections agenda in Georgia has been a bottom-up process as well as a top-down one. Across the state, conspiracy theorists have begun to populate the ranks of election boards in places like Spalding County, giving Trump\u2019s election lies a more powerful constituency than they enjoyed in 2020.\n\n\u201cThe MAGA movement will be set for life if Donald Trump and the party can purge the RINOs from Georgia,\u201d says the Republican source close to Trump. \u201cIn the last [presidential] election, there were too many establishment Republicans standing in the way. They are why Georgia fell to Joe Biden.\u2026 If we beat them back there, which we couldn\u2019t in 2022, you\u2019re clearing out the losers who want to go back to the party of Bush or McCain.\u201d\n\nDeep within Trumpworld, preliminary planning is underway, spearheaded by attorneys and others close to the former president, to challenge the results and supposed fraud in Georgia\u2019s Democratic strongholds. Already, at least a handful of influential Republicans in Georgia have moved in a similar direction. In the state\u2019s November 2023 elections, four Republican board members on three Georgia county-election boards refused to certify the results of the elections, citing concerns about voting machines, reminiscent of Trump\u2019s lies in 2020.\n\nDuring Georgia\u2019s presidential primary in March, Fulton County Republican Board of Elections member Julie Adams refused to certify the results of a primary contest that Trump won without question. In May, Adams sued the board with help from lawyers at the Trump-connected nonprofit America First Policy Institute \u2014 seeking judicial backing for her claims that Board of Elections members have the authority to deny the certification of election results.\n\nDemocrats see Adams\u2019 move as part of a pattern. \u201cThe MAGA Republicans have made it clear they are planning to try to block certification of November\u2019s election, and this is a transparent attempt to set the stage for that fight,\u201d the Georgia Democratic Party said in a statement responding to Adams\u2019 suit.\n\nTRUMP\u2019S YEARS-LONG election-denial campaign has unleashed a darker tide of threats toward election officials.\n\nThe intimidation of election workers has grown to such a peak that the Justice Department had to create a special Election Threats Task Force to prosecute what Attorney General Merrick Garland earlier this year called \u201ca deeply disturbing spike in threats against those who serve the public.\u201d\n\nIn January, Gabriel Sterling, a Republican and the chief operating officer in Raffensperger\u2019s office, was the victim of a \u201cswatting\u201d call \u2014 an attempt to trick armed police into rushing a victim\u2019s home on false pretenses. Around the same time, Georgia\u2019s state assembly received a bomb threat.\n\nThe secretary of state\u2019s office has had to prepare for a range of different security contingencies as the 2024 election gets closer. \u201cInterest gets elevated, as do emotions, so that is something that we are assessing,\u201d Raffensperger tells Rolling Stone.\n\nHis office has set up regular meetings with county election officials and law enforcement to carry out tabletop exercises examining a host of different potential threats, some of them fairly exotic.\n\n\u201cSomeone sent a fentanyl-laced letter several months ago to Fulton County,\u201d Raffensperger says. The attack targeted election officials in Georgia and Washington state.\n\n\u201cWithin days of that happening, we worked with state public health and we were able to get Narcan to all 109 counties and do a training session for everybody who was at our big state conference,\u201d explains Sterling. \u201cWe had public health come and do training on that for about 45 minutes, and we distributed it all.\u201d\n\nFor Sara Tindall Ghazal, the Georgia state election board\u2019s lone Democrat, the prospects of violence and intimidation loom heavy. \u201cI am worried about more-aggressive voter-intimidation efforts,\u201d she says. \u201cI am worried about people getting in the back of a truck with AR-15s and giant flags, and driving past polling places.\u201d\n\nTindall Ghazal, who is battling cancer, recounts how she had to reach out to police \u201cafter a pointed email talking about treason and the death penalty\u201d landed in her inbox.\n\n\u201cI had police patrol in front of my house before a particularly controversial meeting,\u201d Tindall Ghazal says. At the time, the state election board was convening to consider a push by Republicans in the state Assembly to give the body the authority to investigate Raf\u00adfensperger over his handling of the 2020 election.\n\nAt another meeting, Tindall Ghazal tried to explain that voters had already reelected Raffensperger by a commanding majority in 2022. The crowd erupted in shouts of denunciation.\n\n\u201cI am the one person who they literally yell at in meetings. I can\u2019t tell you the number of times I\u2019ve had to stop speaking because I\u2019m getting yelled over,\u201d she says. \u201cAny time I talk about the fact that the 2020 election was legitimate, they just start yelling,\u201d she says.\n\nBurt Jones, Republican candidate for Lieutenant Governor speaks as Republican Governor Brian Kemp listens at a press conference 2022, in Atlanta. Elijah Nouvelage/Getty Images\n\nFOR TRUMP AND HIS FOLLOWERS, the right\u2019s multipronged offensive to influence Georgia\u2019s election process isn\u2019t just about 2024.\n\nSince last year, Trump has regularly asked confidants whether Georgia\u2019s Republican Lt. Gov. Burt Jones would make a good governor. A hard-line MAGA conservative, Jones served as one of Trump\u2019s fake electors in Georgia during the then-president\u2019s endeavor to overturn the 2020 election results. The day before the Jan. 6 riot, Jones was in Washington, D.C., trying to convince Vice President Mike Pence to go along with Trump\u2019s coup plot.\n\nJones\u2019 efforts earned him scrutiny from state law enforcement. In April, a special prosecutor was appointed to probe his role in the 2020 Georgia election-subversion scheme.\n\nIn Trump\u2019s private discussions of Jones, he likes to note that Jones is \u201cvery loyal,\u201d and has frequently suggested that Jones would be a \u201cstrong\u201d leader for Georgia, two people familiar with the situation say.\n\nAs lieutenant governor, Jones replaced a Republican critical of Trump. Now, Jones is aiming for higher office. There\u2019s no guarantee that Jones secures a Trump endorsement, much less the Republican nomination. But the election of an indicted election denier to the state\u2019s highest office would represent a stunning and four-year-belated victory for the MAGA movement. And for a thoroughly Trumpified GOP, that\u2019s the goal.\n\n\u201cIt is Donald Trump\u2019s party,\u201d says a GOP source close to Trump. \u201cEvery conservative state is gonna act like it, and there\u2019s nowhere more important for winning that battle than Georgia.\u201d",

For nearly 30 minutes, the man who served as Donald J. Trump\u2019s vice president was repeatedly applauded as he offered a vigorous affirmation of his support for Israel at a conference of mostly conservative Jewish leaders in midtown Manhattan.\n\nHe barely paused when his questioner, Zvika Klein, the editor in chief of The Jerusalem Post, asked Mr. Pence, an evangelical Christian, to lead the room in prayer for the Israeli hostages captured by Hamas on Oct. 7. \u201cIt would be my great honor: Let us pray,\u201d he said.\n\nHis invocation drew applause and shouts of \u201cAmen.\u201d\n\nIn the seven months since he dropped out of the race for the Republican presidential nomination, in the face of inevitable defeats in the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary, Mr. Pence has been seeking out friendly audiences like this one as he embarks on a mission to resuscitate his political career. But just as importantly, he is presenting himself as the guardian of the conservative traditions of a Republican Party that he grew up with and that have since been redefined by Mr. Trump.\n\nHe has begun turning up on high-profile television interviews to criticize Mr. Trump\u2019s position on abortion, in one example. He announced that his political advocacy group would spend $20 million this year on appearances and advertisements that promote endangered conservative positions on issues including tariffs, government spending and America\u2019s role in the world.",

He recently ousted the paper\u2019s American editor and replaced her with a former colleague from The Telegraph, dumbfounding American reporters who had never heard of him.\n\nEmma Tucker (formerly of The Sunday Times) took over The Wall Street Journal last year, shortly after Mark Thompson (formerly of the BBC) became chairman of CNN, where he has ordered an American remake of the long-running BBC comedy quiz show \u201cHave I Got News for You.\u201d\n\nThey joined a slew of Brits already ensconced in the American media establishment. Michael Bloomberg, a noted Anglophile, hired John Micklethwait (former editor of the London-based Economist) in 2015 to run Bloomberg News.

He ran for president in 2005, 2013 and 2017, when he withdrew in favour of Raisi.\n\nJalili, who is Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei\u2019s direct representative to the country\u2019s Supreme National Security Council, withdrew from the 2021 election in favour of Raisi, who won virtually unchallenged.\n\nMost prominent among those disqualified are Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the populist ex-president, as well as moderate candidate and former three-time parliament speaker Ali Larijani \u2013 both of whom did not qualify to run in 2021 as well.\n\nIran was slated to have its presidential election in 2025, but the vote was brought forward after Raisi died on May 19 in a helicopter crash in northern Iran. The 63-year-old Raisi was expected to secure another term in office and was a top name associated with the succession of Iran\u2019s 85-year-old supreme leader.\n\nSeven others, including Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian, were also killed in the crash, which the army said in a preliminary report last month did not occur as a result of criminal activity.\n\nZakani, who became Tehran mayor after withdrawing in favour of Raisi in the 2021 race, said in a post on X following his qualification on Sunday that he wishes to \u201ccontinue the path\u201d of the late president.\n\nParliamentarian Masoud Pezeshkian, former interior and justice minister Mostafa Pourmohammadi, and Amirhossein Ghazizadeh Hashemi, the head of Iran\u2019s Martyrs Foundation, cap the list of the six approved candidates.\n\nThe 70-year-old Pezeshkian, a veteran five-term lawmaker and former health minister, is the only candidate representing significantly weakened moderate and reformist factions of Iran\u2019s political landscape.\n\nEshaq Jahangiri, the former first vice president in the administration of moderate President Hassan Rouhani, was among those disqualified by the Guardian Council, along with former central bank chief Abdolnaser Hemmati, who had been allowed to run in 2021 and got 8 percent of the total vote, or 2.42 million votes.\n\nThe other candidates represent the conservative and hardline political factions, which have increasingly gained prominence since the breakdown of Iran\u2019s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers after the unilateral withdrawal of the United States in 2018.\n\nGhazizadeh was also approved in 2021 and received 3.45 percent, or less than a million votes. Raisi won the presidency with almost 18 million votes for a 48.8 percent turnout.\n\nThe nuclear programme and Iran\u2019s economy challenged by high inflation and sanctions are expected to be some of the issues to be discussed during five rounds of four-hour debates that state television plans to host in the run-up to the election.\n\nTurnout has been steadily declining in presidential and parliamentary elections since 2020, with the March 2024 parliamentary election seeing 41 percent participation, the lowest since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.",

        "text": "Why Robert F. Kennedy\u2019s Jr.'s current presidential polling numbers might not hold up into November\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has reached 15% or more in three approved national polls. One more, and he will have met one of CNN\u2019s benchmarks to qualify for the debate June 27 with Democratic President Joe Biden and presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump.\n\nBut Kennedy cannot count on maintaining his current level of support as the November election nears.\n\nIt is pretty common for third-party candidates to look like they have polling momentum in the months before an election, only to come up far short at the ballot box, according to an Associated Press analysis of Gallup data going back to 1980.\n\nThat is not a sign that the polls about Kennedy are wrong right now. They just are not predictors of what will happen in the general election.\n\nStudies have shown that people are bad at predicting their future behavior, and voting is months away. And in a year with two highly unpopular candidates in a rematch from 2020, voters may also use their early support for a third-party candidate to express their frustration with the major party choices. In the end, voters may support the candidate for whom they feel their vote can make a difference or they may decide not to vote at all.\n\nAMERICANS WANT A THIRD PARTY, IN THEORY\n\nThe concept of a third party has been popular for a long time.\n\nA poll conducted by Gallup in 1999 found two-thirds of U.S. adults said they favored a third political party that would run candidates for president, Congress and state offices against Republicans and Democrats. (The AP analysis used Gallup data, when available, because Gallup has a long history of high-quality polling in the United States.)\n\nWhat to know about Trump\u2019s second term:\n\nStaffing the administration: Here are the people Trump has picked recess appointments Follow all of our coverage as Donald Trump assembles his second administration.\n\nAbout 6 in 10 U.S. adults have said in Gallup polling since 2013 that the Republican and Democratic parties do \u201csuch a poor job representing the American people\u201d that a third major party is needed. In the latest Gallup polling, much of that enthusiasm is carried by independents: 75% say a third party is needed. About 6 in 10 Republicans and slightly fewer than half of Democrats (46%) say an alternative is necessary.\n\nMarjorie Hershey, a professor emeritus in the political science department at Indiana University, said Americans generally like the idea of a third party until specifics emerge, such as that party\u2019s policies and nominees.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a symbolic notion. Do I want more choices? Well, sure. Everybody always wants more choices, more ice cream choices, more fast-food choices,\u201d Hershey said. \u201cBut if you start to get down to brass tacks and you talk about, so would it be tacos or burgers, then that\u2019s an entirely different choice, right?\u201d\n\nTHIRD-PARTY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES RARELY GET A SUBSTANTIAL SHARE OF THE VOTE\n\nThat hypothetical support for third-party candidates often breaks down quickly.\n\nThe AP analysis looked at polling for every independent and minor party presidential candidate who received at least 3% of the popular vote nationally going back to the 1980 election.\n\nIn multiple elections, including the 1980, 1992, and 2016 presidential races, third-party candidates hit early polling numbers that were much higher than their ultimate vote share. For instance, in polls conducted in May and June 1980, between 21% and 24% of registered voters said they would like to see independent candidate John Anderson, a veteran Republican congressman from Illinois, win when he ran for president against Republican Ronald Reagan and Democratic incumbent Jimmy Carter. Anderson went on to earn 7% of the popular vote.\n\nPart of the problem is that early polls often look quite different from the actual general election vote.\n\nVoters \u201cdon\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen between now and the election,\u201d said Jeffrey Jones, a senior editor at Gallup. \u201cThings are going to come up in the campaign that could change the way they think.\u201d\n\nDecades after Anderson, polls conducted during the 2016 presidential campaign put support for Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson, a former New Mexico governor, at between 5% and 12% in polls of registered voters conducted from May to July. That led some people to predict that he could do better than any third-party candidate in decades. Johnson won about 3% of the vote in that election.\n\nJohnson told the AP that he believes his name should have been included in more polls, though he was in surveys used to determine eligibility for debates.\n\nHe also contends that independent candidates struggle to match major party candidates in fundraising.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s money, first and foremost. People don\u2019t donate if they don\u2019t think that you have a possibility of winning,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI\u2019m not excluding myself from that same equation. Look, am I going to give money to somebody that I know is going to lose? I\u2019d rather go on a vacation in Kauai,\u201d Johnson said in an interview while driving with his family on a trip in Hawaii.\n\nKENNEDY\u2019S SUPPORT MAY DROP OFF AS THE ELECTION NEARS\n\nThe American electoral system makes it hard for third parties to thrive. Still, it is possible to have a significant impact without coming close to winning.\n\nBillionaire businessman Ross Perot is among the most successful modern-day examples. He won 19% of the vote when he ran for president in 1992. But that was substantially lower than his support in earlier polling. In polls conducted from May to July of that year, between 30% and 39% of registered voters said they would vote for Perot.\n\nThere are already reasons to believe that at least some of Kennedy\u2019s polling support may be a mirage. (The Kennedy campaign did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nA CNN poll conducted last summer when he was running for the Democratic nomination found that 2 in 10 Democrats who would consider supporting him said that their support was related to the Kennedy name or his family connections. An additional 17% said they did not know enough about him and wanted to learn more, while only 12% said it was because of support for his views and policies.\n\n\u201cA variable that is so different from all these other people is the Kennedy name,\u201d said Barbara Perry, an expert in presidential studies at the University of Virginia\u2019s Miller Center. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of emotion around him that I would say was not there in the Anderson, Perot, (Ralph) Nader and Johnson cases.\u201d\n\nThere also is some evidence that Americans are using support for Kennedy to express frustration with Biden and Trump.\n\nHershey notes that for many people, presidential elections can feel abstract until a few weeks before it happens, so it is good to take early poll numbers with a grain of salt.\n\nSuch polls \u201cdon\u2019t necessarily reflect actual political issues,\u201d Hershey said. \u201cThey reflect general views about life.\u201d",

We need every voter. I don\u2019t care about you. I just want your vote,\u201d he said, adding that he was joking.\n\nEarlier in his speech, he said the campaign would offer help to people who were feeling tired and joked that \u201ceverybody,\u201d including the U.S. Secret Service, was worried about the safety of the crowds and not about him.\n\n\u201cThey never mentioned me. I\u2019m up here sweating like a dog,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is hard work.\u201d\n\nTrump returned to Nevada, one of the top battleground states in the November election, for his second rally since he was found guilty in a hush-money scandal.\n\nThe unprecedented conviction of a former president has juiced Trump\u2019s fundraising and galvanized his supporters, but it remains to be seen whether it will sway swing voters. Trump is scheduled to be interviewed by New York probation officials via a video conference Monday, a required step before his July sentencing.\n\nWhat to know about Trump\u2019s second term:\n\nStaffing the administration: Here are the people Trump has picked recess appointments Follow all of our coverage as Donald Trump assembles his second administration.\n\nTemperatures in the Southwest have cooled since reaching historic highs late last week but remain above normal for this time of year and topped 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) at the rally, which took place at a park with little shade next to the airport.\n\nWell into his speech, Trump said it was \u201cnot as bad\u201d as he thought it would be, and said he was angrier with the teleprompters not working well, even when he used to mock President Barack Obama for relying on that device.\n\n\u201cI pay all this money to teleprompter people, and I\u2019d say 20% of the time, they don\u2019t work,\u201d he said, adding he would not pay the vendor who provided the prompters. \u201cIt\u2019s a mess.\u201d\n\nCampaign organizers handed out water bottles as supporters waited in line to be screened by security officers. Inside the venue, large misting fans, pallets of water and cooling tents were placed around the perimeter.\n\n\u201cThis is a dry heat. This ain\u2019t nothing for Las Vegas people,\u201d Nevada GOP Chair Michael McDonald said. \u201cBut what it symbolizes for the rest of the United States \u2014 we will walk through hell\u201d to elect Donald Trump.\n\nMcDonald and five other Republicans have been accused of submitting certificates to Congress falsely declaring Trump the winner of Nevada\u2019s 2020 presidential election and their trial has been pushed to next year.\n\nTrump said the rioters who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 to contest the election were \u201cvictims\u201d of a \u201cset up.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were really, more than anything else, they are victims of what happened. All they were doing is protesting a rigged election. That\u2019s what they were doing. And then the police say, go in, go in, go in, go in,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat a set up that was. A horrible, horrible thing.\u201d\n\nThe conspiracy theory that the Jan. 6 rioters were encouraged by law enforcement is widespread on the right but has no basis in fact. Many of those who were at the Capitol on Jan. 6 have said \u2014 proudly, publicly, repeatedly \u2014 that they did so to help the then-president.\n\nFederal and state election officials and Trump\u2019s own attorney general have said there is no credible evidence the 2020 election was tainted. The former president\u2019s allegations of fraud were also roundly rejected by courts, including by judges Trump appointed.\n\nThe campaign paid for additional EMS services to be on site in the case of emergency. The Secret Service made an exception to allow people to bring in personal water bottles and umbrellas.\n\n\u201cYou know what? It\u2019s worth it,\u201d said Camille Lombardi, a 65-year-old retired nurse from Henderson in suburban Las Vegas who was seeing Trump in person for the first time. \u201cToo bad it wasn\u2019t indoors, but that\u2019s OK.\u201d\n\nDuring a Trump rally in Arizona on Thursday, the Phoenix Police Department said 11 people were transported to hospitals, treated and released for heat exhaustion. Many of Trump\u2019s supporters waited in line for hours and some were unable to get inside before the venue reached capacity. The temperature reached a record 113 degrees Fahrenheit (45 degrees Celsius) that day.\n\nTrump\u2019s Nevada rally, his third in the state this year, came on the tail end of a Western swing that included several high-dollar fundraisers where he was expected to rake in millions of dollars.\n\nDemocrat Hillary Clinton won Nevada in 2016 as did President Joe Biden in 2020, but Nevada was the only battleground state where Trump did better against Biden than Clinton. In the 2022 midterms, Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak, a Democrat, was the only incumbent governor who did not win reelection.\n\nTrump hopes his strength among working-class voters and growing interest from Latinos will push him to victory in the state.\n\nIn a play for Nevada\u2019s massive service-sector workforce, Trump said he\u2019d seek to eliminate taxes on tips, a major source of income for food servers, bartenders and others who power glitzy Las Vegas hotels.\n\nThe Culinary Union Secretary-Treasurer Ted Pappageorge criticized Trump for making that promise, a measure he said the union has fought for decades.\n\n\u201cRelief is definitely needed for tip earners, but Nevada workers are smart enough to know the difference between real solutions and wild campaign promises from a convicted felon,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign announced a renewed push for Hispanic voters ahead of the event with a Latino Americans for Trump Coalition. Four of the speakers who warmed up the crowd before Trump took the stage were Hispanic immigrants. _____\n\nGomez Licon reported from Miami.",

AVALON/ABACA\n\nOnce the European elections, scheduled for June 6-9, are over, the 27 member states will turn their attention to another election, which in some respects is just as decisive for Europe's future. On November 5, on the other side of the Atlantic, Americans will choose their next president. For the European Union (EU), this could mean the return of Donald Trump to the White House.\n\nTrump's first term left the EU 27 with some bad memories. Today, apart from Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who on March 8 met his \"good friend\" Trump in his Mar-a-Lago mansion, and Italian Council President Giorgia Meloni, whose party, Fratelli d'Italia, maintains friendly relations with the Republican candidate's team, no European leader is looking forward to him taking the helm once again.\n\nBut, in a way, the four years Europeans have spent working with Joe Biden have prepared them for this. It's true that the Democratic president has warmed up a transatlantic relationship that his predecessor had damaged. True, he has stood by the Europeans and Kyiv since the start of the war in Ukraine. But, in essence, the Biden years have only affably confirmed Washington's relative disinterest in Europe.\n\nTrade disputes\n\nThis is most evident in the economic field. For example, when Biden announced the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in August 2022, which provides massive subsidies for green technologies made in America, he was unconcerned that this new legislation could lead to relocations from Europe to the US. \"The US has confessed to us that it has taken these measures without even imagining the consequences for the rest of the world,\" said the Elys\u00e9e Palace.\n\nBiden had no more scruples when, in mid-May, he announced major tariff increases on products imported from China (electric vehicles, steel, aluminum, semiconductors, batteries, certain essential minerals and photovoltaic cells). However, \"what China won't sell to the US, it will dump on Europe. Biden has just started a trade war,\" said a senior European official.\n\nRead more Subscribers only Protectionist escalation: 'Europe could be engulfed in the economic rivalry between China and the US'\n\nEven though Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the EU Commission, invested plenty in her personal relationship with the American president, she didn't get much out of it. Washington has only marginally modified its IRA arrangements. As for the trade disputes that pre-existed Biden's election \u2013 the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on aluminum and steel, the Airbus-Boeing dispute \u2013 they have been the subject of a truce between the two sides, but are still unresolved.\n\nYou have 73.87% of this article left to read.

        "text": "Meloni has won over Biden, now she hopes for Trump's return\nItalian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni greets supporters at a campaign meeting of the far-right Fratelli d'Italia party for the European elections, in Rome, Italy, on June 1, 2024. TIZIANA FABI / AFP\n\nAs Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni prepares to host the G7 summit in Puglia from June 13 to 15, just a few days after the European elections (June 6-9), she can congratulate herself on having won the confidence of US President Joe Biden's administration. However, her national-conservative camp, represented by the Fratelli d'Italia party, has not distanced itself from the galaxy of former president and Republican candidate Donald Trump, with whom Meloni's forces have been mixing with for years.\n\nBetween Italy and the United States, networks have developed and are redoubling their activity in the run-up to the US presidential election in November. Admittedly, Meloni refrains from publicly supporting Trump in his legal woes, contrary to her ally and vice president of the council, Matteo Salvini (Lega, far right), who boasted of having spoken to him on the phone on June 5. She is no less enthusiastically received by those in the American Republican universe who are interested in Europe. Some go so far as to see in her the promise of a new Margaret Thatcher (1925-2013), British prime minister from 1979 to 1990 and conservative benchmark par excellence.\n\nRead more Subscribers only Europeans are worried about Trump's return to the White House\n\nAt the same time, Meloni has built up a warm relationship with Biden, symbolized in the eyes of the press by the kiss he placed on her forehead during the Italian leader's last visit to Washington on March 1.\n\nThe key to the Melonian paradox\n\nIn both the US and Europe, where the Italian prime minister plays the institutional game and makes herself unavoidable, the key to the Melonian paradox lies in the leader's turnaround on Ukraine. \"At first, concern prevailed,\" said Charles Kupchan, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and adviser on European affairs in the administrations of presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. \"Then Meloni proved solid in her support for Kyiv, earning her a place in the Oval Office. We also realized that she hadn't joined populists Viktor Orban of Hungary or Jaroslaw Kaczynski of Poland in their opposition to the rest of Europe. She has integrated herself into the institutions.\" From an American perspective \u2013 Democrat or Republican \u2013 Italy's exit from China's Belt and Road Initiative, in December 2023, is also to the credit of the council president.\n\nRead more Subscribers only Giorgia Meloni's European double bluff\n\nIt was not so long ago, however, that Meloni was extolling the virtues of Russian President Vladimir Putin, condemning sanctions against Moscow and calling for the destruction of the European Union, as in 2019 at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), the major annual meeting of American conservatives. Trump then served as a major reference for a politician still very much in the minority. Meloni, courted by MAGA ideologue Steve Bannon, then called Obama, of whom Biden was vice president, a \"friend of Islamic fundamentalists.\" During the January 6, 2021 assault on the Capitol by supporters of Trump (whose victory she had openly wished for), she presented the outgoing president as a peacemaking figure.\n\nYou have 55.14% of this article left to read.
