        "text": "How Latino voters view the 2024 presidential election\n(Jeff Greenberg/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)\n\nFrom 2016 to 2024, the number of Latinos eligible to vote grew from 27 million to a projected 36 million.\n\nWhile Latino voters have favored Democratic candidates in presidential elections for many decades, the margin of support has varied. In 2020, 61% of Latino voters cast their ballot for Joe Biden, while 36% voted for Donald Trump, a narrower margin than in 2016 between Hillary Clinton and Trump.\n\nHow we did this Pew Research Center conducted this analysis to understand U.S. Hispanics\u2019 views of the 2024 presidential election campaign. For this analysis, we surveyed 9,424 adults \u2013 including 670 Hispanic registered voters \u2013 from July 1 to 7, 2024. Everyone who took part in this survey is a member of the Center\u2019s American Trends Panel (ATP), a group of people recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses who have agreed to take surveys regularly. This kind of recruitment gives nearly all U.S. adults a chance of selection. Surveys were conducted either online or by telephone with a live interviewer. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other factors. Read more about the ATP\u2019s methodology. Here are the questions used for this analysis, the topline and the survey methodology.\n\nHere are key facts about how Latino registered voters view the presidential candidates and major issues ahead of the 2024 election, based on a Pew Research Center survey. The July 1-7 survey was conducted after President Biden\u2019s poor performance in the June 27 debate and before Trump was injured and a spectator killed in a shooting at a campaign rally on July 13.\n\nEqual shares of Latino registered voters say they would vote for Biden and Trump in the 2024 election. Roughly a third of Latino voters (36%) say they would vote for or lean toward each of the candidates if the election were held today.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. \u2013 a third-party candidate \u2013 gets the support of 24% of Latino registered voters. Support for Kennedy is higher among Latinos than among U.S. voters overall (15%).\n\nRelated: Third-party and independent candidates for president often fall short of early polling numbers\n\nNeither Biden nor Trump has the confidence of most Latino voters on several issues.\n\nThe state of the U.S. economy and inflation have been top issues for Latino voters in 2024.\n\nAbout half of Latino voters (52%) say they have confidence that Trump will make good decisions about economic policy.\n\nBy comparison, four-in-ten say they have confidence in Biden in this area. Trump also has a slim edge over Biden on foreign policy.\n\nMeanwhile, 49% of Latino voters say they have confidence in Biden to select good Supreme Court nominees, compared with 42% who say the same about Trump.\n\nWhen it comes to making good decisions about abortion policy, 50% of Latino voters express confidence in Biden, while 45% have confidence in Trump.\n\nAnd on immigration, 39% have confidence in Biden, while 45% have confidence in Trump.\n\nRelatively few Latino voters would describe Trump as honest and Biden as mentally sharp. Roughly half of Latino voters (55%) say \u201chonest\u201d describes Biden very or fairly well, while 30% say the same about Trump.\n\nAnd just a quarter of Latino voters say they would describe Biden as \u201cmentally sharp,\u201d while nearly twice as many (49%) describe Trump this way.\n\nLatino voters continue to have a more favorable opinion of the Democratic Party than the Republican Party. However, neither party is viewed favorably by a majority of Latino voters (or of the public overall).\n\nSome 44% of Latino registered voters have a very or mostly favorable opinion of the Democratic Party, while 32% say the same about the GOP.\n\nViews of the Democratic Party also vary among Latino voters based on certain demographic characteristics:\n\nWomen are more likely than men to say they have a favorable opinion of the Democratic Party (50% vs. 40%).\n\nLatino voters ages 50 and older are somewhat more likely than their younger counterparts to say they have a favorable view of the Democratic Party (48% vs. 42%).\n\nHalf of Latino registered voters say the Democratic Party cares at least somewhat about people like them. Four-in-ten have the same view of the Republican Party.\n\nSimilarly, when Latinos are asked how hard each party works to earn the vote of people like them, roughly half of Latino voters say the Democratic Party works at least somewhat hard (54%) compared with 47% who say this about the GOP.\n\nNote: Here are the questions used for this analysis, the topline and the survey methodology.",

Here are 5 ways to take care of your mental health\n\ntoggle caption Elijah Nouvelage/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe presidential election is taking a toll on the mental health of Americans. And that's according to recent surveys conducted before the attempt on one candidate's life and widespread calls for another to drop out of the race.\n\nIn a poll by the American Psychiatric Association, nearly three-quarters (73%) of respondents said they're feeling anxious about the election. Another poll by Myriad Genetics found that nearly 40% said they are feeling anxious and/or depressed about the election season, and a similar share said they are \"checked out\" by the amount of news and social media attention on politics and the upcoming election.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nPsychologists say it's normal for people to feel heightened negative emotions during this time.\n\n\"There's a range of emotions that people experience during this time leading up to elections that can go from fear to anger to feeling stressed out to feeling extremely sad and fearful of the future,\" says psychologist Krystal Lewis at the National Institute of Mental Health. \"Those emotions are all valid, and it's OK to feel those emotions.\"\n\nAnd it's important to pay attention to those feelings, especially stress, says psychologist Lynn Bufka, deputy chief of professional practice at the American Psychological Association.\n\n\"It's probably telling us to pay attention to some extent to what's happening in the world so that we can be prepared to act in ways that are consistent with our beliefs and our values,\" she says.\n\nLewis says it's a good idea to channel that stress and anxiety into ways we can make a difference. That might involve getting more information on specific candidates and the policies they support. Here, she emphasizes not to lean on what someone else thinks or says but to rely on \"factual or validated news sources and websites.\"\n\n\"Figure out ways to use your voice,\" she says. \"Use that energy to either volunteer with organizations or share some information with other people, and essentially [exercise] your right to vote.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThat said, it's also important to pay attention to whether these feelings of stress and anxiety are overwhelming or getting in the way of daily life.\n\n\"When the stress becomes intense or long lasting and maybe symptoms develop such as prolonged sadness, worry, hopelessness, physical tensions or signs of anxiety and stress in the body, then that might be a point of intervention,\" says Lewis.\n\nIn other words, if your feelings are very overwhelming and persist for a long time, seek mental health care. And if you are feeling any of those symptoms, it's important to find ways to manage them.\n\nPeople with preexisting anxiety and depression might be more likely to experience these symptoms at a time of societal uncertainty and upheaval, she adds.\n\nFor those looking to get a handle on their stress and anxiety right now, here are some strategies from Lewis and Bufka.\n\n1. The first thing to do is understand what's fueling your symptoms \u2014 it's the uncertainty.\n\n\"Uncertainty is a breeding ground for anxiety and fear,\" says Lewis.\n\n\"We'd like to know what's going to happen,\" adds Bufka. \"We'd like to predict. So when uncertainty strikes, many people start to imagine worst-case scenarios.\" And that's not helpful, she says. \"An important strategy there is to try to break that habit, not go to the what's-the-worst-thing-that's-going-to-happen and anticipate everything will fall apart if X happens or Y happens.\"\n\nInstead, she suggests asking ourselves questions like: \"How likely is that worst-case scenario? Can I manage to cope with that? What are the kinds of things that I might again have some control over to try to manage a situation that would look like that?\"\n\nThose specific questions and one's responses to them can help people get a sense of control. \"Focusing on what we can control is a great way to help us manage our stress and anxiety,\" says Bufka.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n2. Another way to exercise control is to limit how much news one consumes.\n\nKnow when to step away or take a break, suggests Lewis. \"What that might look like is turning off the television, news outlets, wherever you're receiving your news,\" she says.\n\nThat includes social media. \"We don't have to scroll through social media just because it's handy and it's in front of us because we have smartphones in our pockets,\" says Bufka.\n\n3. Do things that are meaningful to you.\n\nThat could involve connecting with other people on issues you care about and working toward a cause, says Bufka. Or it might involve \"making sure that your older parents have a good meal tonight because they don't feel up to cooking themselves,\" she says, \"or picking up the trash in your neighborhood just to make it a better place.\"\n\nResearch shows that engaging in activities that are meaningful improves people's overall well-being, says Bufka, particularly during times of stress.\n\n4. Find other healthy ways to cope.\n\nThat includes doing things that bring you joy and keep you in the present moment, says Lewis, instead of worrying about what may or may not happen in the future.\n\n\"So this might be for individuals who like to be outside, [spend] time in nature, doing fun things with your family, finding joy in your daily activities.\"\n\nAnd don't forget to move your body, notes Bufka. \"We have extra energy in our bodies when we're stressed and overwhelmed, and being active allows us to release that stress,\" she says. \"Whether it's going on a walk, whether it's pulling weeds in the garden, whether it's playing soccer with your friends, playing tag with the kids \u2014 any of those things can help us release some of that physical energy and feel a little more present.\"\n\n5. Stay socially connected.\n\nAs multiple studies have shown, social isolation is bad for our mental and physical health. And it is particularly harmful if our mental health is already feeling frayed. \"Staying socially connected with friends, family, peers that help support us and give us someone to turn to when we're feeling overwhelmed \u2014 that makes a big difference in how we handle our stress,\" notes Bufka.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBut, she cautions, \"we do have to be careful to not turn into stress spirals with other people.\"\n\nAnd make sure not to isolate yourself from people who have different political views from you, she adds.\n\n\"We don't have to dive into political conversations with everybody that we meet,\" she says, \"but connecting with people who might actually have different points of view than us [and] seeing our shared humanity can help us to lower the temperature about what our feared outcomes are.\"",

        "text": "Deep Dive: Immigration, Asylum, and the U.S. Election\nDeep Dive: Immigration, Asylum, and the U.S. Election\n\nAn interview is conducted at a job fair for refugees and asylum seekers at The New School's Arnhold Hall on June 29, 2024 in New York City. (Andres Kudacki/Getty Images)\n\nWe\u2019re pleased to introduce Deep Dive, a new article series on hias.org that explores, in detail, a specific issue relevant to HIAS\u2019 work. In this first edition, we lay out five key facts about one of the most important issues informing the upcoming U.S. presidential election: immigration, refugees, and asylum. Few issues loom larger for the upcoming presidential election in the United States than immigration. During the Republican National Convention, a parade of speakers spoke about undocumented immigrants, asylum seekers, and refugees in near-apocalyptic terms. Democrats, too, have touted their \u201ctoughness\u201d on immigration, while the Biden administration has enacted historically stringent measures to curb asylum. This change reflects a public souring toward immigration: Gallup recently reported that 55% of Americans want immigration levels reduced \u2014 the highest figure since 2001. Since our founding more than a century ago, HIAS has provided essential services to refugees, asylum seekers, and other displaced and stateless people around the world. In order to frame the U.S. immigration debate in truth \u2014 rather than misinformation, propaganda, and innuendo \u2014 below are five relevant facts you should know. Fact One: Seeking Asylum is Legal. The United States government defines asylum as a form of protection granted to foreign nationals or stateless individuals who face, or are at risk of facing, persecution on account of their race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or association with a particular political opinion. Asylum rights became enshrined into international law following the Second World War and were codified in U.S. law in 1980. People have a right to claim asylum in the U.S. regardless of how they entered the country. In the past decade, asylum rights have come under sustained threat. But it remains legal in the United States \u2014 and a crucial right to protect.\n\nRelated News Asylum Backlog Presents Anguish, Uncertainty for Seekers\n\nFact Two: Asylum Is Not Easy to Obtain. Immigration opponents have portrayed the United States asylum system as a free-for-all, where every individual who approaches the border claims asylum and then enters the country freely. In fact, the asylum process is complex, tricky, and, for many applicants, one that does not result in acceptance. Asylum claims filed in immigration court face steep odds, especially for claimants \u2014 some 70% of the total number \u2014 who do not have legal representation. But even those who do obtain the services of an attorney enter a system with a daunting backlog. Moreover, there has been an onslaught of recent changes at the U.S.-Mexico border that prevent people from accessing the asylum system in the first place. Recent policies require people to wait in Mexico while trying to access appointments via a cellphone app, deny due process in initial screening interviews, speed up deportations at the border, increase the usage of immigration detention, and simply deny entry to asylum seekers altogether. All these factors contribute to the approval rate for asylum seekers remaining low. In 2021, only 37% of asylum applications were granted.\n\nAsylum claims filed in immigration court face steep odds, especially for claimants \u2014 some 70% of the total number \u2014 who do not have legal representation.\n\nFact Three: Asylum Seekers and Refugees Help the Economy. A common claim made by anti-immigrant politicians is that asylum seekers and refugees are a drain on the economy, namely by competing with native-born Americans for jobs and driving wages down. In fact, the opposite is true: A recent study from the Department of Health and Human Services found that between 2005 and 2019, asylees and refugees contributed a net $124 billion to the U.S. economy \u2013 more than the GDP of the Dominican Republic. Refugees and asylum seekers are almost 50% more likely than the general U.S. population to become entrepreneurs, despite facing obstacles \u2014 like easy access to credit \u2014 that American-born entrepreneurs take for granted. Earlier this year, HIAS launched the Economic Advancement Fund (EAF), a Community Development Financial Institution designed to provide resources to refugee entrepreneurs in the U.S. Fact Four: Asylum Seekers and Immigrants Commit Fewer Crimes, Per Capita, Than Average. One of the most consistent lines of rhetoric from anti-immigrant politicians is that refugee and asylum seekers are directly responsible for an increase in crime. At the Republican National Convention, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) said that \u201cevery day Americans are dying \u2014 murdered, assaulted, raped by illegal immigrants that the Democrats have released.\u201d The facts do not back up this insinuation. A 2020 study found that in Cruz\u2019 own Texas, a state that records the immigration status of everyone who is arrested, undocumented immigrants are significantly less likely to commit crimes.\n\nA 2020 study found that Texas, undocumented immigrants are significantly less likely to commit crimes.\n\nFact Five: Our Asylum System Is Broken. But That Doesn\u2019t Mean It Can\u2019t Be Fixed. Immigration opponents often argue that measures to prevent people from entering, and to curtail access to asylum \u2014 such as construction of a border wall, or Title 42-style suspensions \u2014 are the only solution for tackling the rise of encounters at the U.S.-Mexico border. This is a false choice. People who are fleeing danger will not stop trying to save the lives of themselves and their families. Draconian policies do not stop people from coming \u2014 they only increase a volatile and chaotic environment that denies the rights of asylum seekers and does nothing to provide security at the border. Real solutions are possible, but there must be political will to achieve them. The present situation along the border occurred due to multiple factors, not least that Congress has failed to pass significant immigration reform since 1996. More resources are also needed on the local level. In cities across the U.S., HIAS has seen an outpouring of welcome for newcomers seeking safety \u2014 but these communities can\u2019t do it alone. The federal government has failed to allocate sufficient resources to support cities as they work to meet the needs of asylum seekers.\n\nRelated News Hetfield Calls for Immigration Reform at U.S. House Hearing",

He is capitalising on the popularity boost that he has inevitably benefited from since surviving an assassination attempt a week earlier .",
        "text": "Editorial on the Republican National Convention: Trump season\nAs the Republican National Convention drew to a close in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, it became obvious that the Party\u2019s expected nominee for the 2024 U.S. presidential election in November, former President Donald Trump, is not only capitalising on the popularity boost that he has inevitably benefited from since surviving an assassination attempt a week earlier, but has now established total control of the Republican Party and is in a strong position to take on incumbent President Joe Biden in that regard. The Convention itself marked several firsts \u2014 not only was Mr. Trump\u2019s speech the first major public remarks he delivered since the assassin\u2019s bullet injured his ear but otherwise left him unscathed, but the Convention itself was held for the first time in person since the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the cancellation of all public political events in 2020. It would also appear that Republican strategists have deepened their appreciation of optics as far as Mr. Trump\u2019s appeal among the electorate goes. There was a distinct attempt to project the political power of women at the event, almost as if to soften the former president\u2019s image, which was in years past battered by revelations of his unflattering remarks about women. Mr. Trump\u2019s wife Melania made a rare appearance at the event, as did his 17-year-old granddaughter Kai, his daughter-in-law and co-chair of the Republican National Committee, Lara, Arkansas Governor Sarah Sanders, Mr. Trump\u2019s former Press Secretary, and Indian American Usha Chilukuri Vance, who is the wife of Mr. Trump\u2019s running mate, J.D. Vance.\n\nThere is much to analyse in Mr. Trump picking the 39-year-old Mr. Vance for Vice Presidential candidate in the upcoming race. Mr. Trump is evidently keen to win over younger demographic cohorts in this election; he is also aligned to white, male America, and what it stands for in the country\u2019s fraught politics today. There is also a geographic message in the subtext \u2014 as the junior Senator from Ohio, Mr. Vance could also become a critical interlocutor for the Trump campaign\u2019s engagement with the all-important Rust Belt states \u2014 swing states of the mid-western U.S. that can potentially make or break a presidential candidate. While there is no denying Mr. Trump\u2019s overall strong position and lead in swing states according to several national polls, three months is a long time in politics, and that certainly applies to the U.S.",

        "text": "How Biden\u2019s re-election campaign fell apart \u2013 a timeline of three tumultuous weeks\nThey may go down as the wildest three weeks in the history of the US presidency, when the prospects of Joe Biden\u2019s candidacy surviving until polling day seemed to change from day to day \u2013 sometimes even from hour to hour.\n\nHere\u2019s a summary of the milestone events in an rollercoaster period in US politics. It began with a political debate on national TV that triggered a Democratic rebellion, took in a shocking assassination attempt on Donald Trump and ended with Biden withdrawing his 2024 candidacy and endorsing his deputy Kamala Harris.\n\n27 June\n\nBiden and Donald Trump face off in the earliest debate ever staged between two main candidates in a presidential election, largely in response to demands by a White House team eager to allay doubts over the president\u2019s advanced age (81) and suspicions that his cognitive powers are fading. Instead, Biden puts in a perplexing performance that intensifies the concerns. Over 90 minutes, he appears at times confused, mangles his sentences, repeatedly loses his train of thought and fails to combat a rush of lies from a bullishly confident Trump, who cannot conceal his glee over his rival\u2019s discomfiture. Democratic operatives exchange frantic messages calling for Biden to abandon his campaign even while the debate unfolds.\n\n28 June\n\nThe president, realising his campaign is suddenly in deep trouble, tries to launch a counteroffensive, telling a rally of supporters in North Carolina that he is staying in the race. \u201cI know I\u2019m not a young man,\u201d he shouts \u2013 reading his remarks from a teleprompter. \u201cI don\u2019t debate as well as I used to, but I know what I do know \u2026 When you get knocked down, you get back up!\u201d\n\nFew are convinced. Within hours, the New York Times, the most influential newspaper in the US, publishes a searing editorial telling Biden to step aside, calling his candidacy a \u201creckless gamble\u201d that risks a second Trump presidency.\n\n2:11 Why Joe Biden has dropped out of the presidential race - video explainer\n\n3 July\n\nAs pressure mounts and with a Democratic member of Congress, Lloyd Doggett of Texas, already having called for him to withdraw, Biden meets virtually with state governors in an effort to set minds at rest. But although he wins statements of support, doubts persist after it is reported that he tells them that he is trying to refrain from holding events after 8pm to conserve energy. There is unease at his response when one governor, Josh Green of Hawaii \u2013 a medical doctor \u2013 inquires about his health, eliciting the puzzling response: \u201cIt\u2019s just my brain.\u201d\n\n5 July\n\nBiden gives his first mainstream interview since the debate, an eagerly awaited 22-minute affair with George Stephanopoulos of ABC in a school library in Wisconsin. It is an improvement on the disastrous debate showing but hardly reassuring. The president declares that only the \u201cLord almighty\u201d could persuade him to step aside from the race. Many Democrats also express deep misgiving about his response to being asked how he would feel if he ran against Trump in November only to lose. \u201cI\u2019ll feel as long as I gave it my all and I did as good a job as I know I can do \u2013 that\u2019s what this is about,\u201d he replies. Some condemn the statement as out of touch, given the Democratic fears of a second Trump presidency.\n\n7 July\n\nHakeem Jeffries, the Democratic leader in the House of Representatives, holds crisis talks with senior party House members, at least four of whom say the president should step aside as candidate.\n\n8 July\n\nBiden strikes back in anger. As members of Congress return to Washington DC after a recess, the president sends a letter to the entire Democratic congressional contingent telling them he is unequivocally committed to staying in the race and reaffirming his belief that he can beat Trump. He follows up with an unscheduled live telephone interview to MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe programme in which he throws down the gauntlet to his critics by telling them to \u201cchallenge me at the [Democratic] convention\u201d, due to take place in Chicago in August. Jeffries meets with a full complement of House Democrats on Capitol Hill, some of whom tearfully voice fears about the effect Biden\u2019s plunging popularity in the polls might have on their own election prospects. Yet many Democrats appear resigned to Biden staying on the ticket.\n\n10 July\n\nWith the mutiny apparently fizzling out, the New York Times gives it renewed impetus by publishing an opinion article from George Clooney, one of the Democrats\u2019 biggest fundraisers, urging Biden to stand down. Proclaiming his love and admiration for the president, Clooney cites his personal experience of a fundraising event in Hollywood last month attended by Biden, who he says cut the same disturbingly diminished figure that millions saw on the debate stage in Atlanta on 27 June.\n\n11 July\n\nWith the pressure on and mounting numbers of Democrats calling for his withdrawal, Biden holds a rare news conference marking the close of Nato\u2019s 75th anniversary conference in Washington DC. Facing massed ranks of international journalists and speaking for an hour without the aid of a teleprompter, the president gives an admirable \u2013 yet still flawed \u2013 performance. He expounds on intricate details of foreign and economic policy. At the same time, he commits embarrassing gaffes, referring to his vice-president, Kamala Harris, as \u201cVice-President Trump\u201d without correcting himself, having earlier mistakenly introduced the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, as \u201cPresident Putin\u201d. The performance seems enough to buy him time.\n\n0:59 Joe Biden mistakenly refers to Zelenskiy as Putin before correcting himself \u2013 video\n\n13 July\n\nDonald Trump survives an assassination attempt at a campaign rally in Butler county, Pennsylvania, a stunning development that puts the discussions on Biden\u2019s candidacy on hold just as the president has been holding talks on his future with leading party figures, including Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate majority leader.\n\n14 July\n\nBiden\u2019s staff temporarily suspends all campaign events and political advertising in a display of solidarity over the attempt on Trump\u2019s life. The president gives a prime-time televised speech from the White House urging that both parties rhetorically \u201clower the temperature\u201d to stave off a rise in political violence.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Stakes \u2014 Presidential Transition Free newsletter We will guide you through the aftermath of the US election and the transition to a Trump presidency Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The plan triggers an immediate backlash among Democrats who still believe Biden must step aside.\n\nMeanwhile, Biden gives an arresting answer to NBC\u2019s Lester Holt in another prime-time interview when asked who he listens to on whether he should remain or drop out of the race. \u201cMe,\u201d he replies. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this a long time.\u201d\n\n17 July\n\nWhile campaigning in Nevada, the president tests positive for Covid and immediately returns to his home in Delaware to isolate. The announcement seems to mark an end to the brief respite in the efforts to persuade him to end his candidacy. The DNC, reportedly following an intervention by Schumer, announces it is postponing the planned electronic roll call by at least a week \u2013 giving Biden\u2019s critics more time to muster.\n\nOn the same day, senior Democrats including Adam Schiff, the Democratic candidate for US Senate in California, the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, and the House majority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, privately confront Biden about continuing his re-election bid.\n\n18 July\n\nWith Trump preparing to accept the Republican nomination in at the GOP convention in Milwaukee, reports emerge that Biden is at least listening to arguments that he should withdraw and asking if Harris would fare better. It is also reported that Barack Obama has told associates that he believes the president\u2019s path to winning the election has greatly diminished and that he should reconsider the viability of his campaign.\n\n19 July\n\nTen congressional Democrats \u2013 nine House members and one senator \u2013 call for Biden to stand aside as the candidate, bringing the total who have done so publicly to 32. The president insist he will continue as the nominee and is ready to resume campaigning after isolating from Covid, seemingly confounding speculation that he could be preparing a withdrawal announcement.\n\nBiden reiterates that he will stay in the race. The Biden campaign chair, Jen O\u2019Malley, says Biden is \u201cabsolutely\u201d in the race. \u201cJoe Biden is more committed than ever to beat Donald Trump,\u201d she says.\n\n3:53 Joe Biden: a look back at his 50-year political career \u2013 video\n\n21 July\n\nBiden announces that he will not seek re-election, and endorsed his vice-president, Kamala Harris, aiming to avoid further party chaos. Earlier on Sunday, Biden lost the support of the West Virginia senator Joe Manchin, a Democrat turned independent, who urged Biden to drop out but called for an \u201copen process\u201d to select a successor.\n\n\u201cWhile it has been my intention to seek re-election, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and focus solely on fulfilling my duties as president for the remainder of my term,\u201d Biden says in a letter announcing his decision.\n\nDemocrats will hold their convention in Chicago in August, in what was expected to be a Biden coronation but which will now free 4,700 delegates to select a candidate. They are not obliged to select Harris. Ohers potentially waiting in the wings include the California governor Gavin Newsom, Governor Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Governor Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania.\n\nDonald Trump responded to Biden\u2019s announcement, saying his ex-rival was not fit to run for president and \u201cnot fit to serve\u201d, Trump added: \u201cWe will suffer greatly because of his presidency, but we will remedy the damage he has done very quickly.\u201d\n\nRead more about Joe Biden dropping out of the 2024 election:",

        "text": "Electoral votes and swing state margins, explained\nA version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nAnyone who pays any attention to US politics is bound to hear some version of this claim: The 2024 election, which will pick a president for a nation of more than 330 million people, will be decided by a small number of voters in a few key states.\n\nIn 2020, Joe Biden turned a handful of states from red to blue to defeat then-President Donald Trump. The difference between victory and defeat was a tiny fraction of voters in those states.\n\nIn 2024, it could again be small margins in these few states that are the difference between another Trump Republican presidency or a win for Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee.\n\nTrump will try to win those same states back from Democrats. The map could also change since the US population is shifting and both sides are hoping to bring a few more states into their respective column. In any event, the margins could be just as close.\n\nBut to say that a small number of voters \u201cdecide\u201d the election is a major oversimplification of the American system and how it has evolved.\n\nHere\u2019s how things work:\n\nThere are 538 Electoral Collegevotes split among the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Each state gets at least three votes, depending on the size of their congressional delegation.\n\nThe smallest states get three (they have two senators and one member of Congress). Washington, DC, also gets three. The most populous states get a lot more. California gets 54 electoral votes (it has two senators and 52 congressional districts). Texas has 40, Florida has 30, New York has 28 and so on.\n\nThe winner is the candidate who gets 270 or more electoral votes. If no candidate gets to 270 electoral votes, the House of Representatives picks the winner from among the candidates who got electoral votes.\n\nA dozen states were decided by 5 percentage points or less in either the 2016 or 2020 presidential election. In CNN\u2019s 2024 race ratings, Maine is the only one of these states rated as solidly in one party\u2019s corner, but one congressional district within Maine is seen as competitive. The other 11 states are seen as competitive in the 2024 election. See the ratings here.\n\nViewed another way, we can expect that those states where the previous elections have been close to be the ones where the 2024 election will again be close. Polling backs up this presumption.\n\nIn real numbers, the close margins in those relatively few states equal a very small number of voters in a country of more than 330 million people,but they are necessary for either candidate to reach an Electoral College count of 270. Some of those states came down to tens of thousands of votes. Biden won for Democrats in five states in 2020 \u2013 Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin \u2013 where Hillary Clinton lost, often by very small margins, in 2016. Florida, on the other hand, which has been a battleground for years, went more toward Trump in 2020.\n\nThe campaigns will focus more attentionon the fewer than one-third of all electoral votes they consider to be up for grabs or winnable by either party.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that the number of electoral votes was reallocated after the 2020 election due to the every-10-years census required by the Constitution. North Carolina, Colorado and Florida, potential battlegrounds, each gained an electoral vote. Texas, which Democrats have long hoped would become a battleground but which continues to tilt Republican despite shifting demographics, also gained two votes. Pennsylvania and Michigan are among the states that lost a vote.\n\nThat also means that the populations of these states are changing over time. A battleground in 2024 could look very different in the future. And states that seem safe for either party today could be battlegrounds in the future. For example, Virginia broke in Biden\u2019s favor by about 10 points in 2020, but some polling this year has suggested a closer race there this time around.\n\nTwo states, Maine and Nebraska, apportion some oftheir electoral votes by congressional districtrather than giving all of them to the state winner. In 2020, for instance, Biden won a single vote in Nebraska and Trump won a single vote in Maine. These individual electoral votescould be incredibly important in the event of a tight election this year.\n\nThe end result is that, yes, the 2024election could again come down to relatively few voters in relatively few states.\n\nBut questions remain over who those decisive voters are. Are they the voters who make most states reliably red or blue in most elections? Are they suburban women who were turned off by Trump in 2020, or are they people without a college degree who have moved toward the GOP? Are they minority voters or women energized by the first woman of color to be this close to the Oval Office? Are they older voters who have been trending toward Democrats or younger voters expressing an interest in Republicans? Are they more disinterested voters who only take part in the process every now and then, or is it a question of which party successfully motivates its stalwarts to turn out no matter what?\n\nIt will take all of the above for either candidate to win. However, because the margins in certain states could be so small, incremental shifts in the preference or turnout of any larger group of voters could be decisive.\n\nThis headline and story have been updated with additional information.",

These two words may continue to haunt US President Joe Biden in the coming days, as he decides whether to continue contesting the upcoming presidential election or drop out of the race. The two words were used by former US President Barack Obama when he was asked about the success of Biden\u2019s re-election campaign. This has been reported by The Washington Post.There is growing opposition to his re-election bid and the chances of him returning to the White House is decreasing as the campaign progresses. Donald Trump \u2019s popularity is only increasing after the assassination attempt last weekend. It had been earlier reported that Biden may end his election campaign during the course of this weekend.Barack Obama\u2019s involvement in the US Presidential Election 2024:The former president has been actively involved in the campaign. He is also involved in some behind the scenes action. He has accompanied Biden and participated in two fund raising events. He has also lashed out at Donald Trump calling him a threat to democracy. He has extended his support to Biden in public. Biden had served as the US Vice-President from 2009-2017 when Barack Obama was the president.However, it is his behind the scenes work that is catching all the attention. He has been speaking to some members of the US Congress who are opposing Biden\u2019s presidential nomination. He has also spoken to Biden and called on him to withdraw from the race.He has pointed out that all national surveys indicate a thumping victory for Trump which can be disastrous for the future of the party.Earlier in the US Presidential Election in 2016, at the end of his tenure, Obama had a decision to make. He could support Biden who was then the Vice-President or he could support his Secretary of State Hilary Clinton to contest the election and receive a presidential nomination from the Democratic Party . He decided on supporting the latter. It has been reported that ever since, Biden has been upset with Obama.This virtual roll call is expected before the party\u2019s national convention. It is expected to circumvent the procedure and issue Biden, a presidential nomination. His opponents argue that this will end all the opposition even as the party\u2019s future looks bleak.Biden has his own supporters and is confident of winning the upcoming election. Generally, a former president is politically experienced and his views carry the weight. It is considered seriously.",

        "text": "Biden vows to stay in race as more Democrats ask him to drop out\nStandoff between 81-year-old president and his party expected to intensify as 12 more Democrats ask him to step aside.\n\nUnited States President Joe Biden has promised to remain in the presidential race and beat his opponent despite growing calls from members of his Democratic Party asking him to withdraw.\n\nThe 81-year-old, who is isolating at his beach house in Delaware since his COVID-19 diagnosis, took aim at his rival Donald Trump \u2013 who just wrapped up the Republican National Convention \u2013 in a series of posts online on Friday, and said he would return to campaigning next week.\n\nTrump\u2019s \u201cdark vision for the future is not who we are as Americans. Together, as a party and as a country, we can and will defeat him at the ballot box,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThe stakes are high, and the choice is clear. Together, we will win.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m stuck at home with COVID, so I had the distinct misfortune of watching Donald Trump\u2019s speech to the RNC. What the hell was he talking about? \u2014 Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) July 20, 2024\n\nBut 12 more Democratic politicians, including two senators and a group of Congress members, called on the president to step aside.\n\nOhio Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat who is in a tough race for re-election, said in a statement late on Friday that he agrees with \u201cthe many Ohioans\u201d who have reached out to him asking for Biden to end his campaign.\n\nNew Mexico Senator Martin Heinrich, who is also up for re-election, became the third Senate Democrat to call for Biden\u2019s exit.\n\n\u201cBy passing the torch, he would secure his legacy as one of our nation\u2019s greatest leaders and allow us to unite behind a candidate who can best defeat Donald Trump and safeguard the future of our democracy,\u201d he said.\n\nTop Democratic figures, including Chuck Schumer, Hakeem Jeffries and Nancy Pelosi, have also privately pressured the president to quit, according to media reports.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not going anywhere,\u201d Biden campaign chair Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon said on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe show, and called him the \u201cbest person to take on Donald Trump\u201d.\n\nShe indicated that the growing unease among top Democrats about Biden\u2019s candidacy did not reflect the broader sentiment across the party.\n\nAnd in a call with donors on Friday, Vice President Kamala Harris said: \u201cWe are going to win this election,\u201d US media reported. \u201cWe know which candidate in this election puts the American people first: our president, Joe Biden.\u201d\n\n\u2018Pass the Torch\u2019\n\nA group of Biden\u2019s Democratic detractors are trying to reach him directly through a television advertisement.\n\nThe advertisement, created by the new group Pass the Torch, will start running on Monday on Morning Joe, one of Biden\u2019s favourite shows which he is known to watch regularly, and other daytime MSNBC programming.\n\n\u201cWe want to get this message \u2013 that we\u2019re so grateful for all you\u2019ve done, and now it\u2019s seriously time to pass the torch \u2013 directly to President Biden,\u201d said Aaron Regunberg, a member of Pass the Torch\u2019s steering committee.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be going up on his favourite programmes, and we plan to stay up until we hear the announcement that he\u2019s going to do the right thing and step aside. Hopefully, we\u2019ll be able to take it off the air in the very near future.\u201d\n\nNiambi Carter, an associate professor at the University of Maryland told Al Jazeera that the party would face serious challenges if Biden were to quit the race now.\n\n\u201cI think those who are calling for him to step down will have to get used to the idea and line up behind Joe Biden if he chooses to stay in the race,\u201d she told Al Jazeera. \u201cHe is allowed to do so since he won the primary with little to no challenge.\u201d\n\nCarter said Democrats are in their own way seemingly lacking the willpower exhibited by Republican rivals to march ahead.\n\n\u201cThe money the Biden campaign has made is not transferrable to a new candidate, so a lot of things need to happen very quickly if this is going to be the case, so I think it\u2019s a really short-sighted move on behalf of the Democrats.\u201d\n\nNext week, Biden is scheduled to host Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who will address the US Congress on July 24 amid Israel\u2019s devastating war on Gaza.\n\nWhite House doctor Kevin O\u2019Connor said on Saturday the president had completed his sixth dose of medication and that he was still experiencing a \u201cloose, non\u00adproductive cough and hoarseness, but his symptoms continue to improve steadily\u201d.",

        "text": "Democrats pushing for Biden to exit the race are split over who would lead the ticket next\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 As Democrats churn over whether President Joe Biden should stay in the 2024 race, the party turmoil is deepening over whether his Vice President Kamala Harris is next in line for the job or if a \u201cmini primary\u201d should be quickly launched to choose a new nominee before the party\u2019s August convention.\n\nREAD MORE: These 3 Democrats didn\u2019t do better than Biden in this poll against Trump. They also didn\u2019t do any worse\n\nHarris hit the campaign fundraising circuit Saturday in breezy Provincetown, Massachusetts, and picked up a nod from the state\u2019s prominent Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who said before the visit that if Biden were to step aside, his vice president is \u201cready to step up.\u201d\n\nAt the event, which organizers said raised $2 million and was attended by 1,000 guests, Harris did not mention the calls for Biden to leave the race or for her to replace him, instead repeating one of her regular campaign lines: \u201cWe\u2019re going to win this election,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cDo we believe in freedom? Do we believe in equality? Do we believe in the promise of America? Then are we ready to fight for it?\u201d she called to a cheering crowd. \u201cWhen we fight, we win.\u201d\n\nBut installing Harris to the top of the ticket, which would be a history-making moment for the party elevating the first woman, Black person and person of South Asian descent as its presidential nominee, is not at all certain. Officials from the highest ranks, including Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, prefer an open process, some believing it would strengthen any Democratic nominee to confront Republican Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cIf you think that there is consensus among the people who want Joe Biden to leave\u2026. that they will support Kamala, Vice President Harris, you would be mistaken,\u201d Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said this week on a widely discussed social media post.\n\nWith the publicly aired deliberations, Democrats are prolonging an extraordinary moment of uncertainty and upheaval. Biden has weighty options before him this weekend that could set the direction of the country and his party as the nation heads toward the November election.\n\nIt\u2019s creating a stark juxtaposition with Republicans, who, after years of bitter and chaotic infighting over Trump, are energized and embracing the former president\u2019s far-right takeover of the GOP, despite his criminal conviction in a hush money case and pending federal criminal indictment for trying to overturn the 2020 election before the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.\n\nWATCH: GOP convention ends with Trump\u2019s 3rd nomination and a unified party\n\nBiden, despite a week of campaign stops, interviews and insistence that he is the best candidate to take on Trump in a rematch, hasn\u2019t been able to quell the uproar. Skeptical Democrats doubt he can keep the White House after his stumbled debate performance last month, and worry he will take hopes for party control of Congress down with him.\n\nOn Saturday, Rep. Mark Takano, the top Democrat on the House Veterans Affairs Committee, added his name to the list of nearly three dozen Democrats in Congress who say it\u2019s time for Biden to leave the race. The Californian called on Biden to \u201cpass the torch,\u201d to Harris.\n\nMore lawmakers are expected to speak out in the days ahead. Donors have raised concerns.\n\n\u201cThere is no joy in the recognition he should not be our nominee in November,\u201d said Democratic Rep. Morgan McGarvey of Kentucky, one of the Democrats urging Biden\u2019s exit from the race.\n\nFrom his beach home in Delaware, Biden, 81, is isolating after announcing a COVID infection, but also politically with a small circle of family and close advisers. White House doctor Kevin O\u2019Connor said Saturday that Biden\u2019s symptoms were improving, but that he remained plagued by a dry cough and hoarseness. He received separate briefings Saturday on domestic and national security issues, the White House said.\n\nThe president\u2019s team insisted he\u2019s ready to return to the campaign this coming week to counter what he called a \u201cdark vision\u201d laid out by Trump.\n\n\u201cTogether, as a party and as a country, we can and will defeat him at the ballot box,\u201d Biden said in a statement Friday.\n\nBut outside the Rehoboth enclave, the debate and passions are intensifying.\n\nVery few of the Democratic lawmakers who are agitating for Biden to leave have mentioned Harris in their statements, and some have said they favor an open nominating process that would throw the party\u2019s endorsement behind a new candidate.\n\nA person familiar with Pelosi\u2019s thinking said that while she is a friend and admirer of the vice president, she believes that anybody who wants to be president is better served by such a process, believing that whoever emerges as the candidate would be strengthened to win the election. The person spoke on condition of anonymity to characterize Pelosi\u2019s thought process.\n\nRep. Zoe Lofgren of California, a Pelosi ally who has called on Biden to step aside, said Friday on MSNBC that some kind of \u201cmini-primary\u201d that would include Harris makes sense.\n\nDemocratic Sens. Jon Tester of Montana and Peter Welch of Vermont have both called for Biden to exit the race and said they would favor an open nominating process at the convention.\n\n\u201cHaving it be open would strengthen whoever is the ultimate nominee,\u201d Welch said in an interview with The Associated Press.\n\nREAD MORE: Republicans ramp up attacks on Harris as talk of replacing Biden on 2024 ticket intensifies\n\nOther Democrats say it would be politically unthinkable to move to someone other than Harris, and logistically unworkable with a virtual nominating vote being planned for early next month, before the Democratic convention opens in Chicago on Aug. 19.\n\nMinnesota Rep. Betty McCollum, who has called on Biden to step aside, explicitly endorsed Harris as a replacement.\n\n\u201cTo give Democrats a strong, viable path to winning the White House, I am calling upon President Biden to release his delegates and empower Vice-President Harris to step forward to become the Democratic nominee for President,\u201d McCollum said in her statement.\n\nThe standoff over Biden\u2019s political future has become increasingly untenable for the party and its leaders, a month from the Democratic National Convention that should be a unifying moment to nominate their incumbent president to confront Trump. Instead, the party is at a crossroads unseen in generations.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what else, if anything, the president could do to reverse course and win back lawmakers and Democratic voters, who are wary of his ability to defeat Trump and serve another term,\n\nBiden, who sent a defiant letter to Democrats in Congress vowing to stay in the race, has yet to visit Capitol Hill to shore up support, an absence noticed by senators and representatives.\n\nThe president did conduct a round of virtual conversations with various caucuses in the past week \u2014 some of which ended poorly.\n\nAssociated Press writers Mary Clare Jalonick, Seung Min Kim, Farnoush Amiri and Zeke Miller in Washington contributed to this report.",

        "text": "Trump Promises to Militarize Police, Reincarcerate Thousands, and Expand Death Penalty\nOur analysis of a potential second Trump administration's proposed criminal legal system policies include unlawful tactics that will only harm our communities.\n\nThis piece was published before Joe Biden withdrew from the 2024 presidential election and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to represent the Democratic Party. No significant facts have been changed or added. Donald Trump has long identified himself as the candidate of \u201claw and order\u201d but, during the Trump administration, \u201claw and order\u201d translated to a severe approach to criminal punishment and policing that failed to make us safer. Today, his proposed policies for a second term promise to double down on these ineffective tough on crime tactics. If reelected, a second administration threatens to accelerate mass incarceration and roll back decades of progress by encouraging aggressive policing practices, enacting draconian sentencing regimes, and expanding the use of the death penalty. At the ACLU, we won\u2019t let our country go backward. If Trump returns to office, we\u2019re prepared to meet these unconstitutional policies with the same fierce response as we did during the last Trump administration. Learn more about our roadmap in our breakdown.\n\nTrump on the Criminal Legal System\n\nThe Facts: According to Trump\u2019s campaign, \u201cthere is no higher priority than quickly restoring law and order and public safety in America.\u201d But, just as it was during President Richard Nixon\u2019s 1968 campaign against the war on drugs, \u201claw and order\u201d under a second Trump administration is a \u201cshorthand message promising repression of the Black community.\u201d Specifically, Trump\u2019s law enforcement policies call for further protections for abusive police, including condoning the use of force against protesters, which he once described as a \u201cbeautiful thing to watch.\u201d This rhetoric risks encouraging state actors to take a similarly brutal approach. Beyond rhetoric, however, Trump is also likely to immediately rescind President Joe Biden\u2019s 2022 executive order on policing. Doing so would eviscerate one of the most substantial federal actions on police reform since George Floyd\u2019s murder and roll back important changes to use of force standards, including restrictions on chokeholds and carotid restraints. These expected policies will have an outsized impact on marginalized communities, especially the Black community, which is far more likely to experience police abuse. We also know that a second Trump administration intends to deputize local law enforcement to aid an unprecedented mass deportation effort that would decimate communities. Additionally, Trump has promised that, if reelected, his administration will accelerate mass incarceration efforts by directing federal prosecutors to seek the most serious charges and maximum sentences, pressuring local prosecutors to take a similarly draconian approach, and re-incarcerating thousands of people on home confinement. His administration will also expand the use of the death penalty \u2013 despite Americans\u2019 increasing opposition to capital punishment \u2013 by broadening the category of crimes punishable by death, sentencing more people to die, and killing every person on federal death row. While Trump will have a singular impact on the federal system, ultimately, state and local governments control most of the substantive parts of state criminal legal systems, including policing, prosecution, sentencing, and conditions in prisons and jails. Today, there are over 1.6 million people in state and local jails and prisons, compared to just over 200,000 in federal jails and prisons. But even without direct control of state systems, Trump will play an important role in setting the tone for state policies and many of his plans will have a ripple effect across the country. Why It Matters: The Trump administration has already shown its capacity for brutal criminal legal system policies. In its final year, for example, the Trump Administration executed 13 people, more than half of whom were people of color. Trump executed more people than any administration in 120 years. Trump\u2019s embrace of capital punishment is longstanding. In the 1980s, as a private citizen, he paid $85,000 from his own funds to publish a page-wide advertisement calling for the execution of five Black and Latine boys wrongfully accused as the \u201cCentral Park Five.\u201d But the impact of a second Trump administration doesn\u2019t limit itself to any single area of the criminal legal system. He has proposed punitive policies that promise to dehumanize individuals at every point in the carceral system \u2013 from traffic stops to confinement conditions to sentencing. This tough on crime approach is also ineffective. Creating safe and healthy communities requires investing in programs that address the root causes of crime and disorder, like after-school programs, alternatives to policing, violence intervention teams, substance abuse treatment, employment pipelines, and affordable housing.\n\nTrump on the Criminal Legal System A second Trump administration threatens to increase inequities in our criminal legal system and reverse many reforms gained over the last two decades.\n\nSource: American Civil Liberties Union",

If Biden steps aside, Democrats must quickly decide who would replace him on the top of their ticket . Vice President Kamala Harris would be a logical choice to quickly coalesce delegate votes .",
        "text": "What happens if Biden drops out of presidential race?\nDespite major donors reluctant to keep campaign funds flowing and more Democrats publicly saying that his chances of winning the November election are dwindling, President Joe Biden shows no public sign of stepping down.\n\n\"I look forward to getting back on the campaign trail next week,\" he said in a campaign statement.\n\nBiden is \"in this race and he's in it to win it,\" Dan Kanninen, Biden campaign battleground states director, said in a statement. \"Moreover, he's the presumptive nominee \u2014 there is no plan for an alternative nominee.\"\n\n\"It is high past time we stop fighting one another,\" Kanninen said. \"The only person who wins when we fight is Donald Trump.\"\n\nStill, if Biden does step aside, Democrats must swiftly decide who would replace him on the top of their ticket, and how.\n\nOne scenario would be for Biden to endorse an alternative candidate and ask Democratic delegates to transfer their pledged votes when they assemble next month at the Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nHistorically, convention delegates vote for the candidate who won the primary or caucus in their respective states. Almost all 3,896 Democratic delegates are pledged to Biden after he swept every contest in the country. But that \u201cpledge\u201d can be changed under DNC rules that allow for \u201cgood conscience\u201d to determine delegate decisions.\n\n\u201cThere may be some negotiation if Joe Biden were to decide to step aside to say, maybe we could at least encourage or endorse or try to set in place a way that Vice President [Kamala] Harris might be the nominee,\u201d said John C. Fortier, fellow focusing on elections at the American Enterprise Institute.\n\nHowever, delegates are not required to do so, Fortier told VOA. \u201cThere's not an absolute guarantee or legal way for him to switch his support to her.\u201d\n\nHarris a logical choice\n\nStill, Harris would be a logical choice to quickly coalesce delegate votes. She is already first in the line of presidential succession. Nominating a Black woman could also help secure African American votes, a core bloc of the Democratic Party\u2019s support.\n\nPublicly, she remains loyal. \u201cJoe Biden is our nominee,\u201d she said earlier this month. \u201cWe beat Trump once and we're going to beat him again. Period.\u201d\n\nAs part of the Biden-Harris ticket, Harris would make sense financially. Under campaign finance rules, Harris is entitled to spend the Biden-Harris war chest, which stands at $91 million, according to their last filing report in June.\n\nFifty-eight percent of Democrats think Harris would make a good president, according to a new poll from the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, and about 30% percent of the public overall think she would. Forty-three percent of adults have a favorable opinion of her, including 74% of Democrats.\n\nHowever, Democrats might also want to avoid the undemocratic appearance of an automatic coronation of Harris as Biden\u2019s successor, especially if others come out to contest the nomination.\n\n\u201cThe goal of the party will be to have some sort of process before the convention and at the convention that allows whoever gets into the race to court the delegates,\u201d said Elaine Kamarck, senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings public policy organization and author of a book on how America nominates presidential candidates.\n\nThat process \u201ccould be any number of things,\u201d she told VOA. \u201cIt could be regional meetings. It could be a debate.\u201d\n\nThe bottom line is, should the president step aside, Democrats must quickly figure out who replaces him and who is likely to win the election, said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics.\n\n\u201cAnd that ought to be the same person,\u201d he told VOA. \u201cWhether they can do it in the time permitted \u2014 it\u2019s a month \u2014 is another question entirely.\u201d\n\nOpen convention possible\n\nNext month\u2019s DNC could be an open convention, where the delegates nominate someone other than Biden. It would be a contested convention if there\u2019s more than one candidate vying for the slot.\n\nA contested convention could be tumultuous and divisive, something Democrats would want to avoid two months before the election.\n\n\u201cAt this point, we don't have a contested convention. We might have an open one, but we don't have a contested one,\u201d Kamarck said. \u201cThere's no time, all right. It's a month, literally, from now to the convention. Nobody is calling delegates.\u201d\n\nIf there is a contest, floated names include California Governor Gavin Newsom, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer.\n\nAt the convention, Democrats must also decide who will be at the bottom of the ticket, another process that could create both excitement and division.\n\n\u201cWhoever is the loudest in critiquing Harris' choice will probably be the sort of faction of the party that gets their nominee into the V.P. slot,\u201d said Jennifer Mercieca, professor of political communication at Texas A&M University.\n\nAhead of the November elections, that\u2019s a lot of turmoil for Democrats.\n\n\u201cIt's all speculation at this point,\u201d Mercieca told VOA. \u201cWe have no idea; we've not seen anything like this before.\u201d\n\nAt separate occasions, Biden has said that the direst of polling results could get him to quit, or if there is a \u201cmedical condition that emerged,\u201d or if the \u201cLord Almighty comes out and tells\u201d him to.\n\nThe president remains in isolation in his vacation home in Delaware, following his COVID diagnosis this week.",

        "text": "Highlights from the 2024 presidential election campaign: July 19\nTrump spoke for more than an hour, touching on a plethora of topics, but there were a number of highly anticipated subjects that the former president did not touch.\n\nThe biggest of them was the issue of reproductive rights. Abortion is one of Republicans\u2019 most difficult campaign issues. Trump takes credit for overturning national abortion rights with his appointment of three Supreme Court justices who voted to overturn Roe, but he says he wants to leave the issue to the states to set their own laws and has said he would not sign a national abortion ban.\n\nAlso not mentioned was Vice President Kamala Harris, who in recent weeks has become the target of Trump\u2019s criticism. As Democratic upheaval over President Biden\u2019s debate performance grows, there are rumors that Harris would lead the top of the ticket if Biden were to step down. Trump\u2019s campaign and allies have been adamant that Biden must remain on the top of the ticket.\n\nAnd lastly, Trump did not mention the Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021. Some of his many legal battles and dozens of other Justice Department cases against his supporters center on the incident. It is a day that Democrats have used for several years to document what they say is a candidate who is a clear and present danger to democracy. Trump has mentioned the insurrection in many of his previous political speeches, but it was a topic left untouched at the RNC.",

        "text": "Noncitizens banned from voting in federal elections but not some local races\nDespite widespread GOP claims of rampant noncitizen voter fraud, federal law bans those without citizenship from voting in presidential elections.\n\nMarcela Rosas immigrated to Southern California from the Mexican state of Michoac\u00e1n more than a decade ago in search of the American dream.\n\nShe imagined a life with a house for her three children, educational opportunities and the ability to have a say in her community. There\u2019s one cornerstone of American life that Rosas, 52, hasn\u2019t been able to access: voting.\n\nWithout the ability to elect local leaders, Rosas says she feels powerless to push for change that might improve her family\u2019s quality of life, citing issues like rising housing costs and local taxes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf I had the opportunity to vote I could choose the people I want to represent me \u2014 people who understand my needs and my issues,\u201d she said. \u201cWithout the right to vote I feel segregated from my community.\u201d\n\nRosas is one of thousands living in Santa Ana who could have the chance to vote in local elections by 2028 if city voters in November pass a ballot measure granting noncitizens limited voting power. The measure has drawn intense opposition from locals and organizations who assert that voting is a privilege that should be granted only to citizens.\n\nThe battle in Santa Ana comes as former President Trump, now the official GOP presidential nominee, and other Republicans nationwide continue to raise the specter of immigrants voting illegally in the United States to alter the outcome of election results in favor of Democrats \u2014 despite robust election surveillance laws and decades of studies that dispute claims of rampant voter fraud.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe issue has come up repeatedly during this week\u2019s Republican National Convention, more recently by former presidential candidate and current Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who said on Tuesday that a fundamental GOP party value is \u201cwe believe you need to be a citizen in order to vote.\u201d\n\nNoncitizens range from individuals who are permanent residents in the United States to those who are undocumented. It can include those who have work permits, are refugees or are here under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. Depending on the jurisdiction, there are at times certain criteria a noncitizen must meet to be able to vote in local elections.\n\nDuring a news conference in May, U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said without evidence that widespread noncitizen voter fraud was \u201cunprecedented and a clear and present danger to the integrity of our election system.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEven if you weren\u2019t concerned about the drop boxes and the ballot harvesting of mail-in ballots in 2020 you definitely should be concerned that illegal aliens might be voting in 2024,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Republican-led House passed a bill this month to require proof of citizenship for voter registration, even though federal law already bans noncitizens from voting in presidential elections. Those who break the law and register to vote without citizenship status in federal elections can face imprisonment or deportation.\n\nEven so, federal law doesn\u2019t restrict states from setting their own local and statewide election rules, which could include allowing noncitizens to vote in limited local elections, like school board or city council races.\n\nFewer than two dozen cities have approved local laws that grant voting authority to noncitizens, according to Ron Hayduk, a political science professor at San Francisco State University who has studied and written books about noncitizen voting rights. No state allows noncitizens to vote in statewide elections.\n\nThe majority of those cities are in Vermont and Maryland. A handful of jurisdictions in Massachusetts have also passed local noncitizen voting ordinances, though they remain inactive without state approval, Hayduk said. New York City passed a noncitizen voting law in 2021 that a New York judge then struck down as unconstitutional. A federal judge in March rejected a challenge to a Washington, D.C., law allowing noncitizens to vote in local elections.\n\nIn California, San Francisco became the first city to grant noncitizens some voting rights via a 2016 ballot measure called Proposition N. The measure, which went into effect in 2018, granted parents of school children the chance to vote in school board races. Oakland voters approved a similar ballot measure in 2022, though the law has not been enacted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn November, Santa Ana could become the third city that grants noncitizens eligiblity to cast ballots in municipal elections. The ballot measure differs from San Francisco and Oakland\u2019s laws, granting noncitizens voting rights in local elections for mayor, council members and ballot measures.\n\nProponents say allowing noncitizens to vote is about parity and giving those who pay taxes and contribute to a community a say in their local government. In Santa Ana, which has a population of more than 310,000, there are about 5,600 Vietnamese residents and 64,000 Latinos who are not U.S. citizens, according to Tracy La, the co-founder and executive director of VietRISE.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people worrying about the state of our democracy in this country and whether democracy is under attack, but for us what we really care about is how can it be a true democracy if there are so many people in our community that can\u2019t actually vote,\u201d La said.\n\nThe rules around who can vote and for what race vary across the country, Hayduk said. Some are limited to school board races, while others apply more generally to citywide elections. Some local jurisdictions require voters to be legal permanent residents or have work permits, while others allow any noncitizen to cast a ballot.\n\nBut the idea by Trump and other Republicans that immigrants are voting carte blanche and that Democrats are using those ballots to sway elections is a myth that has been \u201croundly debunked by study after study,\u201d Hayduk said.\n\nNot only are national and statewide election laws extremely stringent, experts say, but immigrants have a lot to lose putting their names on government records.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany states, like California, allow charter cities to create their own election regulations to enfranchise noncitizen voters, Joshua Douglas, a law professor at the University of Kentucky who has studied local voting rights under state constitutions, explained in an email to The Times.\n\n\u201cDoing so does not violate the U.S. Constitution as there\u2019s nothing in the Constitution that forbids the practice, and it does not violate the state constitution in states with state constitutional language that sets a floor for voter eligibility,\u201d he said, adding that it often boils down to whether state constitutional language authorizes \u201cevery citizen\u201d to vote, or \u201conly a citizen.\u201d\n\nA wave of states in recent years have passed constitutional amendments to make it explicit that only citizens can vote, and several others, including Kentucky and North Carolina, will put the question before voters on November\u2019s ballot.\n\nEven in states that allow the practice, there are typically restrictions around how and when noncitizens gain access to the ballot.\n\nTo vote in San Francisco school board races, noncitizen voters have to prove they are of legal voting age, a resident of the city and that they are the parent, guardian or caregiver of a school-age child.\n\nSan Francisco City Atty. David Chiu, who played an instrumental role in getting the ballot measure passed first as a civil rights lawyer and later during his tenure in the state Assembly, said the law is critical to ensuring all parents \u201chave a say in the direction of their childrens\u2019 education, regardless of citizenship.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChiu said there are strict rules governing how noncitizens vote in San Francisco to ensure the program fully protects election integrity. Noncitizen voters receive special ballots that only include school board candidates, and they have to reenroll in the program after every election.\n\n\u201cI am not aware of a single incident of a noncitizen casting an illegal ballot in San Francisco,\u201d Chiu said. \u201cThese (voter fraud) claims are simply not based in reality...and I would also say they misunderstand the operational aspects of current voting programs that protect election integrity.\u201d\n\nChiu later defended Proposition N as city attorney against a lawsuit filed by a conservative legal group seeking to block the law. A San Francisco Superior Court judge initially ruled the law had violated the state Constitution, before an appeals court overturned that decision and allowed the program to continue. The ruling also applied to Oakland\u2019s law, which faced a similar legal challenge.\n\nAttorney and conservative pundit James Lacy, who led the lawsuits in San Francisco and Oakland, filed another lawsuit in May challenging language used in Santa Ana\u2019s ballot measure.\n\n\u201cIf we possess anything important in our citizenship, it\u2019s the ability to vote and to participate in the body politic of our localities in our nation,\u201d Lacy said. \u201cWhen a noncitizen is allowed to vote, it diminishes the value of citizenship. It dilutes the vote of all citizens.\u201d\n\nThe impact of the noncitizen voting laws remains unclear.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2018, only 65 noncitizen residents registered to vote in San Francisco\u2019s school board election, and 59 turned in ballots, according to the city\u2019s Department of Elections. Those numbers dropped to 36 registered voters in 2020, with 31 ballots cast.\n\nWhen three San Francisco school board were removed from office in a February 2022 recall election, registered noncitizen voters swelled to 328, and 235 people voted. Registration numbers dropped dramatically for another election that fall. Noncitizen ballots in the last four school board elections accounted for a fraction of the more than 1.3 million total votes cast.\n\nUp until 1926, noncitizen voting was commonplace in most states, Hayduk said. Citizenship mattered less than other societal markers of success, such as race, gender and class, meaning white male landowners, regardless of citizenship status, usually had access to the ballot box.\n\n\u201cThis idea that the vote is eternal, it\u2019s always been fixed, is incorrect,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s evolving. Democracy is evolving.\u201d",

        "text": "What the 2024 presidential election could mean for commercial solar\nListen to the article 6 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDavid Wei is vice president of finance and operations and Raaghav Salem Karthikeyan is a corporate development MBA intern at SolarKal.\n\nSolar has been on a tear, adding a record-breaking 32.4 GW and holding its place as the incremental market share winner in new installations in 2023. The clean energy source now accounts for 53% of all new electricity generation capacity due to both lower prices and federal incentives.\n\nWith only a few months until the 2024 presidential election, commercial real estate owners are eager to understand what\u2019s at stake for those federal incentives under the next administration. Unfortunately, President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump failed to shed any light on the topic of solar policy during last month\u2019s debate, barely touching on the energy transition.\n\nWhat might a change in administration mean for the Inflation Reduction Act and solar tariffs, and how could it affect solar adoption in the U.S.? Here\u2019s what we can expect.\n\nTrump\u2019s stance on solar and the IRA\n\nDuring his time as president, Trump was largely uninvolved with solar. He did, however, introduce a four-year, 30% tariff on imported solar modules in 2018 to encourage domestic manufacturing, which was then extended by the Biden administration.\n\nNow on the campaign trail, Trump and his supporters have become frequent critics of aspects of the IRA. Trump has indicated that he would seek to dismantle many of the IRA\u2019s policies and cut program budgets significantly if reelected. However, he has primarily attacked tax credits for EVs, batteries and wind farms. Tom Pyle, a Project 2025 contributor who was on Trump\u2019s Department of Energy transition team, has also stated that the former president is not as opposed to solar energy as he is to wind projects.\n\nConsequently, while the IRA is frequently in the headlines, only certain parts of the bill seem to be at risk under a Trump administration. For instance, Trump could hinder EV growth by rolling back pollution regulations or changing Treasury Department rules around EV tax credit eligibility, but a full repeal of the IRA seems unlikely.\n\nBiden\u2019s stance and a brief history on solar tariffs\n\nMeanwhile, Biden has been a clear supporter of solar and renewables via the 2022 signing of the IRA, which pledged $369 billion in tax breaks and subsidies for promoting clean energy, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and investing in sustainable infrastructure. More recently, the Biden administration has also allowed domestic solar production to skyrocket through the implementation of tariffs.\n\nBiden began his term by extending the Trump-era solar tariffs in 2021. The following year, however, he issued a two-year pause on new tariffs to support adoption of the clean energy source and expansion of the U.S. solar industry, aligning with the goals of the IRA. Since the pause ended in June 2024, tariffs on Chinese modules have risen to 50%. The Biden administration is also considering additional tariffs on Southeast Asian manufacturers as U.S. companies continue to compete with a flood of foreign panels in the global market.\n\nAs a result, thanks in part to the IRA and tariffs, domestic solar manufacturing capacity has grown to exceed 26 GW annually under Biden, increasing module supply and creating new jobs.\n\nWill the IRA survive a change in administration?\n\nTo repeal the IRA completely is an uphill battle \u2014 both the House and Senate would need to expend significant political capital to roll it back. It\u2019s also worth noting that inertia and precedent are powerful tools. The IRA has catalyzed hundreds of billions of dollars in private investments, potentially creating nearly 200,000 jobs.\n\nSince a majority of IRA-driven investment has benefited Republican districts, unpicking the legislation would risk harming GOP constituencies. Notably, Republican states account for 58% of the projects announced under the IRA. When looking at congressional districts that have invested the most in solar since the passage of the IRA, eight of the top 10 are Republican. Although no Republicans voted for the IRA, many of its provisions have GOP support, as noted by Rep. Andrew Garbarino, R-N.Y., co-chair of the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus.\n\nWithout full congressional support, and given the aforementioned investment considerations, a change in administration will likely only stymie and delay certain parts of the IRA\u2019s implementation through bureaucratic obstacles rather than guarantee a repeal.\n\nWhy now Is the time to go solar\n\nThe IRA has been wildly successful for solar so far \u2014 domestic production is skyrocketing, and installations are at an all-time high and accelerating. Moreover, IRS rules dictate that solar production tax credits would remain available for projects that start construction by 2030, reducing the risk of uncertainty for developers.\n\nAs we approach the November elections, given the uncertainty around future policy changes, now is the most opportune time to take advantage of current policies.",

        "text": "US Presidential Elections: Biden may step down as Obama, Pelosi join voices of concerns\nAmid a Covid-19 diagnosis and growing concerns over his candidacy among Democrats, US President Joe Biden might be reconsidering his Presidential bid.\n\nWhile Biden had been facing pressure from allies to step down, former President Barack Obama, too, has told allies that he thinks Biden\u2019s path to victory has \u201cgreatly diminished\u201d, the Washington Post reported. Meanwhile, Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi explained to Biden over a call about the party\u2019s chances to lose in case he doesn\u2019t step down, reported the Associated Press.\n\nIn an anonymous interview with the New York Times, few of Biden\u2019s closest people have stated that Biden may be coming to terms with the anxious demands of other Democrats. They also said that it should not come out as a surprise if Biden chooses to announce Kamala Harris as the new President candidate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPresident Biden is currently isolating at his vacation home in Rehoboth Beach in Delaware, after being diagnosed with Covid-19 on Wednesday. The Biden For President campaign has called an all-staff meeting for Friday, July 19, reported the Reuters. He has also been told that the campaign is having trouble raising money.\n\nSenator John Hickenlooper, who was in 2020 up against Biden for the Democratic presidential nomination, has told Reuters that Biden is working towards a decision on whether to stay in the presidential race that is good for the country.\n\nLate Thursday saw Montana Sen. Jon Tester became the second Democrat to call Biden out for stepping down \u201cI believe President Biden should not seek reelection to another term, \u201c he said. \u201cI have worked with President Biden when it has made Montana stronger, and I\u2019ve never been afraid to stand up to him when he is wrong,\u201d Tester said in a statement. \u201cAnd while I appreciate his commitment to public service and our country, I believe President Biden should not seek re-election to another term,\u201d he added.\n\nAs further anxiety swirled, Biden\u2019s closest friend in Congress and his campaign co-chair, Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware, told The Associated Press, \u201cPresident Biden deserves the respect to have important family conversations with members of the caucus and colleagues in the House and Senate and Democratic leadership and not be battling leaks and press statements.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPressed about reports that Biden might be softening to the idea of leaving the race, his deputy campaign manager Quentin Fulks maintained, \u201cHe is not wavering on anything.\u201d",

Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\nThe former president took aim at the Biden-Harris administration's push for environmental policy and mocked the Green New Deal, which was first introduced by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Edward Markey in February 2019.\n\n\"They've spent trillions of dollars on things, having to do with the green new scam, that's a scam, and that's caused tremendous inflationary prices, in addition to the cost of energy,\" Trump claimed.\n\nHowever, during Biden's tenure, the United States has continued to produce and export the most crude oil out of any country, at any time, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n\nCrude oil production averaged 12.9 million barrels per day in 2023, breaking the previous U.S. and global record of 12.3 million, set in 2019, according to the agency.\n\nThroughout his bid for reelection, Trump has been vocal about his plans to double down on reliance on fossil fuels and reverse federal climate action.\n\n\"As President, I will set a national goal of ensuring that America has the No. 1 lowest cost of energy of any industrial country anywhere on Earth,\" Trump said on his campaign website.\n\nOn May 13, during a rally in Wildwood, New Jersey, Trump promised he would halt offshore wind energy projects \"on day one\" if elected.\n\n\"I'm going to write it out in an executive order. It's going to end on day one,\" Trump said, claiming that wind turbines \"kill\" whales, which was later denied by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nIn this Nov. 24, 2019 file photo, the sun sets behind a crude oil pump jack on a drill pad in Loving County, Texas. Angus Mordant/Reuters\n\nAhead of the election, several former Trump administration officials and conservative activists have released a \"Presidential Transition Project\" titled Project 2025 that lists proposals for the new administration if Trump were to take office.\n\nAmong the proposals are sweeping cuts to climate initiatives, saying the next administration will \"stop the war on oil and natural gas.\"\n\nEnding subsidies for electric vehicles, withdrawing the country from initiatives for sustainable food production, preventing federal regulators from considering the economic impact of carbon emissions and abolishing the Energy Department's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy and Loan Programs Office, are listed in Project 2025.\n\nThe Republican National Convention also saw the selection of Trump's running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, who similarly went after climate initiatives during his acceptance speech.\n\nVance said the nation needs a leader who \"rejects Joe Biden and Kamala Harris' Green New Scam and fights to bring back our great American factories.\"\n\nThis seemingly marked a shift in Vance's beliefs, who, during a speech at Ohio State University in 2020, said, \"We of course have a climate problem in our society,\" and added that reliance on natural gas \"isn't going to take us to a clean energy future.\"",

Addressing a rally in Waco, Texas, he asserted, in this race \u201ceither the deep state destroys America or we destroy the deep state.\u201d While Donald Trump has been using the term \"deep state\" for long, Biden's critic have alleged that his administration is being run by the \"deep state\".(AP )\n\nForeign policy experts and political scientists use the term \u201cdeep state\u201d to refer to people and organisations who exercise power in civil society and over political leaders. They mostly applied it to developing nations like Pakistan, Egypt and Turkey, where generals and spies made all the crucial decisions and changed elected officials when they felt it appropriate.\n\nThe Deep State and its origin\n\nThe deep state, according to an American political conspiracy theory, is a covert network of federal employees, particularly those who work for the FBI and CIA, that collaborates with prominent figures from the financial and business sectors to wield power alongside or inside the democratically elected US government.\n\nThe term \u201cdeep state\u201d was first used in the 1990s to refer to what was thought to be a long-standing deep state in Turkey. However, the phrase was later used to describe the US government, particularly under the Obama administration. However, the thesis gained widespread acceptance under Trump's presidency, as he alleged that the purported \u201cdeep state\u201d was working against him and the policies of his government.\n\nDuring Obama's presidency, the focus was on the unsettling accuracy of \u201ctargeted killings\u201d carried out by drones, followed by the controversy surrounding Snowden, the former contractor for the National Security Agency whose 2013 disclosures revealed the startling extent of government eavesdropping. \u201cThere's definitely a deep state. Trust me, I have been there,\u201d he told the Nation in 2014.\n\nApproximately half of Americans, according to opinion polls conducted in 2017 and 2018, believe the United States has a deep state.\n\nTrump vows to \u2018dismantle the deep state\u2019\n\nTrump's obsession with deep state is not something new. He has been promoting this theory since special counsel Robert Mueller began the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.\n\nTrump used the term to criticise leakers and whistleblowers from the US intelligence establishment during his tenure as the president. A large number of the January 6 Capitol rioters drew inspiration from conspiracy theories disseminated by QAnon, which asserted that a deep state was conspiring to destabilise Trump and deceive the electorate. Moreover, Trump has pledged to \u201cdismantle the deep state\u201d if he is elected in November by removing the civil service safeguards that shield thousands of government employees.\n\nFollowing recent assassination attempt on Trump, social media flooded with several conspiracy theories with few calling the attack \u201cstaged\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, one of the US-based account suggested with a history of disseminating misinformation wrote: \u201cThis is price you pay when you take down the elite satanic paedophiles,\u201d referring to the conspiracy theory put forth by QAnon, which contends that Trump is fighting a secret battle against the deep state.\n\nWithout providing any proof to back up the claim, they stated that the \u201corder\u201d for the assassination \"likely came from the CIA\", and accused Mike Pence, Hillary Clinton, and Obama of being complicit. The viral post has so far garnered over 6.9 million views.\n\n\u201cThis is either one of the worst failures in Secret Service history or a deep state plot. There\u2019s no way this should have ever happened,\u201d tweeted Brad Parscale, Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign manager.\n\nBiden and the Deep State\n\nRussian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova recently claimed that the media and the US' \u201cdeep state\u201d have long concealed Biden's actual mental status from the public.\n\nZakharova stated that those who wished to show Biden as capable had instead made things worse. She was reacting after Biden addressed Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the president of Ukraine, as \u201cPresident Putin\u201d.\n\nRussian state media commentators, who have been warning that Democrats would kill Trump, have suggested that Russia's Federal Security Service should begin \"protecting our Donald.\"\n\nRussian propagandists are now accusing both the Democrats and the Ukrainians of attempting to kill Trump. \u201cThe Democratic party is behind this attempted assassination,\u201d claimed former New York Times correspondent John Varoli on the Solovyov Live network's show, At Dawn, on Sunday.\n\nThe presenter further aired a clip from Saturday Night Live in which Jim Carrey makes fun of Biden brandishing a gun as Ponomar implies the President would rather \u201cshoot his opponents.\u201d According to Ponomar, Biden and the \"deep state\" are all set to drown the United States and the rest of the globe in blood. Giving his consent to the claim, Varoli alleged, \u201cJoe Biden is a terrorist.\u201d\n\nHe went on to say that the government controls the Secret Service and other US intelligence services, absurdly implying that they are \u201cfull of liberals\u201d and may have been involved in an attempt on Trump.\n\nAs Biden's capacity to serve another term is being questioned, especially following the presidential debate against Trump, Republicans and some Democrats have urged him to withdraw from the race.\n\nAlso Read: Donald Trump's decision to pick JD Vance was influenced by 3 key figures and assassination warning: Report\n\nIs Deep State controlling the US?\n\nSenator Tommy Tuberville of Alabama highlighted Biden's competence on the Fox News program \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" claiming that Democratic politicians and the \u201cdeep state\u201d have been controlling the incumbent President.\n\nHe alleged that Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi and Obama have been leading the country along with National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and Secretary of State Antony Blinken. \u201cYou can tell by Schumer\u2019s actions, Pelosi\u2019s actions, the first two years they were calling the shots.\u201d\n\nHe hopes Americans will understand that control is with Schumer and Pelosi and all the deep state and not Biden. \u201cThe deep state\u2019s total control over this and hopefully we can get control of it and get the Democrats out of power and get Trump and all the Republicans running this country.\u201d\n\nHere's what experts have to say on Deep State\n\nExperts mostly disregarded claims about the deep state. According to Megan Squire, deputy director for data analytics at the Southern Poverty Law Center's Intelligence Project, \u201cincidents of political violence spawn conspiracy theories and false narratives when people try to spin the event to suit their various agendas,\u201d as reported by The Washington Post.\n\nDavid Rohde, an author of In Deep: The FBI, the CIA, and the Truth About America\u2019s Deep State, stated that the term \u201cdeep state\u201d has been used by Trump and his allies to avoid criticism. He believes that \u201cdeep state\u201d is both a true phenomenon and a toxic distraction, as per Vox.",

        "text": "As President Joe Biden steps aside, is America ready for President Kamala Harris?\nKamala Harris has been on a yo-yo string with Democratic Party bigwigs since that cataclysmic debate performance catapulted her boss out of a sure 2024 nomination.\n\nWeeks before President Joe Biden stepped aside \u2013 and swiftly endorsed Harris to be the 2024 nominee \u2013 the vice president had emerged as the most logical replacement to top the ticket after Biden wore his frailty on national TV.\n\nAllies disseminated a logic about why Harris would be the natural successor: She could seamlessly inherit the campaign's massive warchest; her law enforcement background is best suited to prosecute the political case against Republican Donald Trump; polling shows she can win; and having been the nation's first multiracial and woman VP could galvanize a new generation of younger progressives.\n\nBut from the start, there has been a hesitancy to fully embrace the country\u2019s second-in-command, with some Democrats openly overlooking her. When a group of 24 former House Democrats sent Biden a letter last week lobbying for an open convention in August, it made no mention of Harris.\n\nThe day after Biden found himself fighting for his future in an interview with ABC News\u2019 George Stephanopoulos, Harris was asked to assure Black women, the party\u2019s backbone, that the U.S. wouldn\u2019t take a step backward in this election on issues they care about, including economic and reproductive freedom. Her message was far from reassuring.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the thing about elections,\u201d Harris told a moderator at Essence Festival of Culture in New Orleans on July 6, during a discussion entitled \u201cChief to Chief.\u201d \u201cThe people who make decisions at that level often will pay attention to either who\u2019s writing the checks or who votes. That\u2019s a cold, hard reality.\u201d\n\nRecent history:Kamala Harris on standby as Democrats plunge into panic mode\n\nThe 59-year-old Harris may seem the obvious strategic page turn for the party as well as a generational shift. Her life has been an acrobatic twist and turn, filled with personal challenges and accomplishments, including political tests in her home state of California similar to what she and the country face now.\n\nBut some wonder whether a country bitterly divided by cultural issues around race, gender and family \u2013 already seemingly poised to return Donald Trump to power \u2013 is ready for a woman of color to sit in the Oval Office.\n\n\u201cBlack women are judged more harshly by the right, by the left \u2013 by everyone,\u201d said Aimy Steele, founder and CEO of The New North Carolina Project, which is dedicated to expanding voter engagement and access in the Tar Heel State.\n\nSteele said beyond race and gender, there are other parts of Harris\u2019 life that she believes liberal allies will fail to accept or defend, including that she is a professional woman who went unmarried most of her life and put her career first without having biological children.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re kidding ourselves to really believe that we are, even on the progressive side, in a post-racial democracy or a place where these types of things don\u2019t matter,\u201d said Steele, who unsuccessfully ran for the North Carolina legislature in 2020.\n\nHalie Soifer, CEO of the Jewish Democratic Council of America, told USA TODAY that\u2019s \u201call the more reason to make sure that we stand with her. We need to stand for something.\u201d\n\n\u201cMisogyny, racism and other forms of bigotry are going to exist in this country, and yes, they may even be exacerbated by having a woman of color at the top of the ticket,\u201d said Soifer, who served as a national security adviser to Harris in the Senate.\n\n\u201cBut that is absolutely not a reason to cower or to allow the fear of that hate to impede progress in this country, and that\u2019s actually been driving Kamala Harris her whole career.\u201d\n\nOther progressives still bruised by the political backlashes from the Barack Obama years emphasize that they concur: Harris is the face of the country\u2019s future. The U.S. is projected to be majority people of color by 2045.\n\nTrump and other Republicans have long been aware of the possible ticket switch, and have derided Harris as incompetent, socially awkward and responsible for chief failures in the Biden administration. GOP officials suggest that\u2019s only the beginning.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve not really gone into depths with the record of Kamala Harris,\u201d Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., said in a Fox News Sunday appearance this month.\n\nAt the Republican National Convention last week, former Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley reminded delegates she had predicted Democrats would look to pass the baton to Harris in the middle of the 2024 contest.\n\n\u201cFor more than a year, I said a vote for Joe Biden is a vote for President Kamala Harris,\u201d she said. \"After seeing the debate, everyone knows it\u2019s true. If we have four more years of Biden or a single day of Harris, our country will be badly worse off.\"\n\nDems not fully sold on Harris either\n\nHarris\u2019 opposition is not only coming from the other side of the aisle, as Democratic skeptics worry about her viability.\n\nA former Harris staffer wrote in The Atlantic this month \u201can automatic coronation of Harris would be a grave mistake.\u201d She argued for a process to battle-test her against others vs. Trump; and said supporters are too quick to write off viability concerns as \u201cracist and sexist.\u201d\n\nA new AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research survey released this past week found 58% of Democrats believe Harris would make a good president. But the poll shows 22% of Democrats don't think she would versus 20% who said they don\u2019t know enough about her.\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., warned in a Instagram live Thursday it would be incorrect to think there is a consensus among Democrats that Harris will get the support of people who wanted Biden to leave.\n\nThose individuals, she said, \u201care interested in removing the whole ticket.\u201d\n\nOther progressives, however, warn that backing away from Harris could be disastrous for the party. Democratic strategist Bakari Sellers summed it up in a post on X: \u201cSkip over Kamala Harris at your own peril.\u201d\n\nA child of immigrants with a fierce, \u2018extraordinary\u2019 mother\n\nHarris was born in Oakland, Calif. in 1964 amid the Civil Rights Movement to immigrant parents \u2013 her father Donald Harris, was an economist born in Jamaica and Shyamala Gopalan, was a cancer researcher from India.\n\nIn her 2019 memoir, she briefly describes her parents\u2019 marriage falling apart when she was five, leading to divorce. She only saw her father during summers in Palo Alto when he taught at Stanford, and acknowledges she was shaped by her 5\u20191\u201d mother, whom she calls \u201cextraordinary.\u201d\n\nHer mother took a teaching job at McGill University when Harris was 12, moving her and her sister to Montreal from 1976 until she graduated from high school in 1981.\n\nIt was in Canada where Harris first developed an affinity for lawyers who broke barriers such as Thurgood Marshall, Charles Hamilton Houston, Constance Baker Motley \u2013 giants of the civil rights movement, she wrote.\n\nHarris returned to the states to attend Howard University where she flourished in the environment where \u201ceveryone was young, gifted and Black.\u201d She pledged Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc., the second founded of the historic \u201cdivine nine\u201d Greek-lettered organizations among African Americans. She interned at the Federal Trade Commission; researched at the National Archives and was a tour guide at the U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing.\n\nShe first entered politics as a staffer for Democratic Sen. Alan Cranston, of California, and then returned home to Oakland to U.C. Hastings College of Law and graduated in 1989.\n\nHarris revealed in her book she took the California bar exam that July and \u201cto my utter devastation, I had failed,\u201d an acknowledged setback for a self-described perfectionist. She passed in February 1990 and began work at the Alameda County District Attorney\u2019s Office.\n\nHer political star began to rise in 1994 with her relationship with Willie Brown, the legendary California politician who at the time was the statehouse speaker, married \u2013 although long separated \u2013 and 30 years older than Harris.\n\nCalifornia entrepreneur Trevor Traina, a longtime Harris friend and former U.S. ambassador to Austria, said that relationship was a politically formative one.\n\n\"Kamala\u2019s a warm person who has a lot of charm and charisma. And she is the prote\u0301ge\u0301 of Willie Brown, who is the king of charm,\u201d Traina said in an interview with USA TODAY. \u201cAnd I think she learned well from him.\u201d\n\nInfluential San Francisco Chronicle gossip columnist Herb Caen first put her name in print that March as Brown and Harris were spotted around town.\n\nTheir romance continued to raise eyebrows that November when Brown named Harris to a state medical board, along with a hefty salary. The affair ended in 1996, but the pair would be linked for decades and the subject of character assaults into the 2020 campaign.\n\nKristin Powell, principal of Black to the Future Action Fund, a national political advocacy group, said women in politics typically have their dating and sex lives dragged out in public as disqualifiers for higher office.\n\n\u201cThe threats against her, in my opinion, will be astronomically higher than the ones against Obama because she\u2019s a woman, not just a Black person, but a Black woman,\u201d she said.\n\nPowell said that same standard isn\u2019t applied to men, noting that for years Trump has been accused of having extra-martial affairs and of sexual assault (which the former president vehemently denies).\n\nBy 2000, Harris moved to City Hall and quickly set her eyes on the city\u2019s top prosecutor job, challenging incumbent Terence Hallinan in 2003. An archived radio debate from that election previewed the sharp-elbowed Harris in her first political battle focused on a backlog of 40 homicide cases.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing an erosion of the criminal justice system, an absolute neglect of cases and they\u2019re prioritizing politics over professionalism,\u201d Harris said in the testy segment.\n\nHarris\u2019 campaign sent out mailers featuring the ten faces of previous San Francisco DAs stretching back to 1900. All male, all white. \u201cIt\u2019s time for a change,\u201d it read in block red letters.\n\nShe has continued to underscore the importance of U.S. leadership looking like the increasingly diverse country, including earlier this month at the Essence Festival of Culture, an annual mecca for Black women.\n\n\u201cLet us always celebrate the diversity, the depth and the beauty of our culture,\u201d she said.\n\nIf the vice president were to become the first name on a Democratic ticket, political activists such as Powell believe it would be a game-changer in 2024.\n\n\u201cThere would be a lot of excitement, not just for her, but when a Black woman gets to the White House, her or someone else, it will be a lot of excitement for women in this country because we deserve to have female leadership,\u201d she said.\n\nYet, recent polling shows Harris doesn\u2019t necessarily outpace Biden in terms of Black voter enthusiasm, which may indicate she is in a weaker position than some supporters assume.\n\nMore:Biden's support among Black women leaders still strong even as others jump ship\n\nQuentin James, founder and president of Collective PAC, which is aimed at building Black political power, said the vice president\u2019s identity is a chief engine of her popularity with racially diverse constituents, but that more sophisticated minority voters have a sharper grading curve.\n\n\u201cI definitely think that representation alone is not enough,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are looking for the meat and substance, and not solely the identity.\u201d\n\nPowell concurs that excitement over a non-white, non-male candidate comes second to certain policy commitments, especially among those who\u2019ve lived through the Obama era.\n\n\u201cWe would applaud having a Black woman in the White House,\u201d Powell said. \u201cBut before we get excited about whether that's Kamala Harris, we need to understand what she\u2019s going to give us.\u201d\n\nHarris was California\u2019s top cop\n\nA decade before being elevated to the vice presidency, Harris demonstrated an uncanny ability to beat the political odds in a political landscape that, much like today\u2019s national terrain, was dominated by aging white men.\n\nTraina said more than any other time period, he believes Harris\u2019 time as San Francisco\u2019s district attorney is an instructive window into her leadership. He said the city is cosmopolitan and international, but also notoriously left-leaning ranging from mainstream Democrats to socialists.\n\n\u201cThere's a tension between the center left and the far left, which I think mirrors the national scene right now for the Democratic Party,\u201d Traina said. \u201cAnd you have politicians who need to be elected and who need to be able to speak to the center, who understand how to navigate that environment, and Kamala is one of those people.\u201d\n\nShe took aim at the California Attorney General\u2019s office in 2010 after the incumbent, Democrat Jerry Brown, ran for governor to replace term-limited Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger. It was up to Harris to retain the seat for the Democrats, and that election season was an extraordinary one as well. It would become the nationwide sweep known as the \u201cred wave.\u201d\n\nPolitical attacks on Harris included her decision as San Francisco DA to not seek the death penalty for a gang member who shot and killed a police officer.\n\nOn Election Day in 2010, the red wave broke. Republicans regained control of the U.S. House and reclaimed governor\u2019s seats and statehouses nationwide. In the Harris-Cooley race, however, the vote turned out to be one of the closest in California history. Ballot counting took more than three weeks.\n\nAce Smith, Harris\u2019 political consultant at the time, recalls how the San Francisco Chronicle initially declared Cooley the victor.\n\nIt was a \u201cDewey defeats Truman\u201d moment. In the end, Cooley had to concede.\n\nAuthor Dan Morain, a Harris biographer, points to the win as a formative episode, where national politicians took notice of the upstart from California. The red wave, he said, \u201cstopped at the eastern slope of the Sierra Nevada.\u201d\n\nSmith called Harris a \u201csupremely talented, charismatic person\u201d who attracted voters despite being outspent. In an oral history with Capitol Weekly last year, he suggested the race turned on a debate stage where Cooley defended taking both a pension and a salary after retiring.\n\nHarris\u2019 tenure as California attorney general drew accolades from Obama, who cast her as a \u201cbrilliant\u201d and \u201cdedicated\u201d campaigner.\n\n\u201c(S)he is tough, and she is exactly what you\u2019d want in anybody who is administering the law, and making sure that everybody is getting a fair shake,\" Obama said at a 2013 fundraiser that is best remembered for the president\u2019s commentary on her attractiveness. (He quickly apologized.)\n\nAfter becoming attorney general, it was clear to many observers Harris was aiming for even higher office, taking cautious positions on hot-button issues \u2013 or no position at all.\n\nThat would become the basis of Morain\u2019s book, \u201cKamala\u2019s Way,\u201d about her ascent to the U.S. Senate and ultimately the vice presidency.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about her way of operating, and it\u2019s her path to getting to where she is,\u201d Morain said. \u201cShe can be very tough, she can be empathetic, she can be cautious, she can be unsure of herself, but she\u2019s very smart and quick on her feet.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s in this period that a friend introduced Harris to an entertainment lawyer in L.A. who would become her husband. Doug Emhoff would become the first second gentleman and first Jewish spouse of a president or vice president. After they wed in 2014, Emhoff\u2019s children Cole and Ella didn\u2019t want to call Harris a stepmom and coined the phrase: \u201cMomala.\u201d\n\nBy January 2015 a new lane had opened. Longtime Sen. Barbara Boxer announced she would not seek reelection in 2016. That left two of Smith\u2019s clients, Harris and then-California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, to hash out their political futures \u2013 which Smith has said was less dramatic than some have reported.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s stuff of legends and myths, but not true,\u201d Smith said in 2023. \u201cAnd at the end of the day, (Newsom) wanted to be governor more than he wanted to be senator. She wanted to be senator\u2026 The good news was it was folks who knew each other well.\u201d\n\nIn California\u2019s primary system, where the top two vote-getters advance, Harris emerged as the winner to run against fellow Democrat Loretta Sanchez, an almost 10-year veteran of the House of Representatives. She sailed to a more than 20-point victory over Sanchez in the general election in 2016, with the support of Obama and his vice president \u2013 Joe Biden.\n\nA combative prosecutor on Capitol Hill\n\nHarris became only the second Black woman to serve in the Senate in history following Illinois\u2019s Carol Moseley Braun, a victory that came amid a new kind of red wave: That same night, Trump defeated Hillary Clinton.\n\nHarris arrived at the Senate primed for the conflict. Her maiden speech on the Senate floor laced into Trump\u2019s nominee for education secretary and future Cabinet member Betsy DeVos.\n\nShe landed initial appointments to the Homeland Security and Intelligence committees, in addition to the Environment and Budget panels. A year into office, Harris\u2019 legal background helped her secure a spot on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which gave her a platform to grill Trump\u2019s judicial nominees.\n\nShe leaned into questions about special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia and pressed future Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh on abortion rights.\n\n\u201cCan you think of any laws that give government the power to make decisions about the male body?\u201d she asked Kavanaugh during the exchange.\n\nKavanaugh replied, \u201cI\u2019m not thinking of any right now, senator.\u201d\n\nThe clip went viral.\n\nSoifer, the former national security adviser, said those examples in the Senate underscore how Harris is uniquely positioned to be the Democratic nominee. Harris would be the most stark contrast with Trump at a time when women\u2019s rights, particularly reproductive healthcare, is at the forefront.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a force to be reckoned with, and I would love to see her debate Donald Trump,\u201d Soifer said. \u201cShe would eviscerate him.\u201d\n\nSeveral months after the Kavanaugh hearings, Harris announced she\u2019d run for president. She had served in the Senate just two years. She had not yet written a single piece of legislation that became law.\n\nBut she also had never lost an election.\n\nSizzling debate performance, then presidential hopes implode\n\nNaysayers are quick to point at Harris\u2019 failed 2020 presidential bid, which closed up shop before the first ballots were even cast.\n\nHarris declared in her birthplace of Oakland, near the hospital where she was born; the University of California, Berkeley, where her parents met; and a stone\u2019s throw from where she had worked as a young district attorney.\n\nShe was running to protect America\u2019s democratic institutions and healthcare access for all, she said, to check the white supremacists who descended on Charlottesville and to keep children out of cages at the southern border.\n\n\u201cPeople in power are trying to convince us that the villain in our American story is each other. But that is not our story. That is not who we are. That\u2019s not our America,\u201d she said as she stood in front of Oakland City Hall.\n\nHarris caught the country\u2019s attention when she went after Biden at the first Democratic debate that summer. She criticized the former vice president for comments he\u2019d made about pro-segregationists he served with and shared with him what it was like to be bused to an all-white school.\n\n\u201cYou also worked with them to oppose busing,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd, you know, there was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bused to school every day. And that little girl was me.\u201d\n\nHarris shot up in the rankings: she was in a tight race for second place.\n\nBut the momentum did not hold. Less than three months after the breakout moment, Harris\u2019 campaign was sinking. She was down in the polls, and running out of cash. She\u2019d burned through a $35 million war chest and her campaign was rife with infighting.\n\nHarris made one of the most difficult decisions of her political career. With two months to go until the Iowa Caucus, she quit the race.\n\nSmith, the political consultant who engineered Harris\u2019 2010 win in the face of the red wave, said bowing out of the presidential race in 2020 was the right call and led to her vice presidential nod, contrasted with Elizabeth Warren\u2019s bid that dragged on.\n\n\u201cSometimes,\u201d Smith said in 2023, \u201cthe wisest political decision you can make is actually to realize when you're not being successful and get out.\u201d\n\nThe calculus paid off: When Biden secured the nomination, thanks largely to African American voters, he chose her as his running mate.\n\nHarris\u2019 sharp debate skills served her well on Biden\u2019s ticket. As then-Vice President Mike Pence tried to interrupt her, Harris delivered one of the most memorable lines of her political career that turned into an online sensation.\n\n\u201cMr. Vice President, I\u2019m speaking,\u201d she told Pence.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a remarkable leader who inspires certainly all of those who have worked with her closely, but also now the American people, especially women and young women who look to her as someone who gives them a sense of empowerment,\u201d Soifer said. \u201cShe\u2019s a fighter.\u201d\n\nSome wonder: What has Kamala Harris done as vice president?\n\nHarris' election to vice president as the first woman, Black person and Asian American to serve in the role was met with celebration.\n\nThat enthusiasm waned over the years as Harris fumbled early assignments, which supporters claim she was unfairly saddled with in the early days of the Biden administration.\n\nThe president tasked her with addressing the \u201croot causes\u201d of mass migration to the southern border \u2013 an area she had little to no expertise on as a senator or attorney general. Harris\u2019 team had to bring in outside experts from nonprofit organizations that do work in the region to brief her.\n\nOn a trip to Guatemala that June, Harris came under heavy scrutiny for telling NBC\u2019s Lester Holt she\u2019d been to the U.S.-Mexico border. Neither she nor Biden had at that point. The White House stressed that was not her assignment \u2013 it was to work with Northern Triangle countries. Harris soon caved to political pressure. Within weeks, she visited El Paso, Texas, where she scolded Congress to \u201cstop the rhetoric and the finger pointing\u201d and pass immigration legislation.\n\nThe pandemic and the efforts the White House took to protect the president and vice president from getting COVID left Harris isolated and unable to travel frequently her first year in office. The problem was compounded as Biden and his advisers struggled with how to utilize her.\n\nThose episodes were brought up regularly during the GOP convention in Milwaukee last week as Republicans prepared for a scenario in which Harris could be the Democratic candidate.\n\n\u201cWhen Joe Biden and Kamala Harris refused to even come to Texas and see the border crisis that they created, I took the border crisis to them,\u201d Republican Gov. Greg Abbott said on the convention stage.\n\nOther Republicans, such as Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., accused the VP of enabling \u201ccriminals and rioters\u201d during the protests following the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer.\n\nBiden had served in the Senate for more than three decades before he became vice president. There was no existing schema for someone like Harris. She was a trained lawyer, who did a short stint as a senator.\n\n\u201cMost of that stuff is not transferable to the job of the vice president,\u201d said Harris\u2019 first communications director as vice president, Ashley Etienne. \u201cSo she figured out what are her strengths. And she\u2019s over indexed on them.\u201d\n\nHarris finds her footing on reproductive rights, other liberal causes\n\nIt took the leak of a Supreme Court decision reversing Roe v. Wade for Harris to cut her own path. She\u2019d worked closely with abortion rights advocates in California. She was in her element.\n\nIn a fiery speech the next day at an abortion rights gala, Harris reminded activists of her exchange with Kavanaugh.\n\n\u201cThose who attack Roe have been clear. They want to ban abortion in every state. They want to bully anyone who seeks or provides reproductive healthcare. And they want to criminalize and punish women for making these decisions,\u201d she said.\n\nJason Williams, a professor of justice studies at Montclair State University in New Jersey, said Harris\u2019 stepped-up presence in the wake of the Dobbs decision changed the perception of her role.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when we\u2019ve seen in a very public way the power that she brings to this team,\u2019\u2019 Williams said. \u201cObviously when she's talking about anything in the judicial system that\u2019s her own thing. That\u2019s what she went to school for. That\u2019s what she has worked (for) as\u2026 a prosecutor for so many years.\u201d\n\nHarris traveled the country, sounding the alarm. Democrats lost the House in the midterm elections but kept the Senate with her assistance.\n\nThe election-year victories finally offered Harris an issue area she could own. She reoriented her agenda around cultural issues such as gun rights and book bans. Her team launched a tightly controlled national college tour that was designed to amplify her message. Celebrity moderators appeared on stage with Harris as the VP fielded pre-approved questions.\n\nBiden tapped her for bigger and better opportunities to represent the U.S. at overseas summits.\n\nAfter Hamas launched a brutal, surprise attack against Israeli civilians on Oct. 7, Harris sat in on Biden\u2019s calls with Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Biden then sent Harris to Dubai to discuss the governance of Gaza after the war with Middle Eastern leaders.\n\nThere she delivered a searing statement about how Israel was conducting itself in the war.\n\n\u201cThe United States is unequivocal: International humanitarian law must be respected,\u201d Harris said. \u201cToo many innocent Palestinians have been killed. Frankly, the scale of civilian suffering and the images and videos coming from Gaza are devastating.\u201d\n\nIn March, she called for an immediate cease fire \u2013 remarks that were among the most pointed at that time from a member of the Biden administration.\n\n'Already on the job:' VP role gives Harris an edge\n\nThe balance Harris would have to achieve as a presidential candidate is differentiating herself on these issues, while also taking credit for some of the administration\u2019s accomplishments, such as student debt forgiveness and job creation.\n\nShe will have to sell herself \u2013 quickly.\n\n\u201cThis would be the challenge: Can she communicate how much of a role she played in those kinds of outcomes?\u2019\u2019 said Ange-Marie Hancock, executive director of the Kirwan Institute at The Ohio State University and curator of the Kamala Harris Project, a consortium of scholars from the country studying the vice president.\n\nElaine Kamarck, a longtime Democratic National Committee member and expert on the party\u2019s rules, told a group of Democratic activists during a Friday call that Harris has two major advantages: she\u2019s already been vetted and she\u2019s already on the job.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to, likely, have some surprise,\u201d Kamarck said on the call organized by the group Delegates are Democracy. \u201cNone of the other candidates, great as they are \u2013 and some of them, I like very much, I might even like them more than the vice president \u2013 none of them have been vetted on a national stage.\u201d\n\nAs a former prosecutor, many believe Harris also would not be intimidated by Trump, which could come with its own backlash.\n\n\u201cAs a woman and as a woman of color, how aggressive can she be before people start having the reaction that she\u2019s too aggressive,\u2019\u2019 said Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University. \u201cIs that trope of the angry Black woman going to be thrown at her?\u201d\n\nWhile racist and sexist attacks aren\u2019t new, Walsh is among those who expect them to ratchet up if Harris runs for president, alongside persistent questioning about ability and qualifications.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be a walk in the park,\u2019\u2019 Walsh said. \u201cWe are not post-racism. We are not post-sexism. We\u2019re still there.\u201d",

        "text": "Will Joe Biden quit US presidential race? What happens next if he does\nWill Joe Biden drop out of the US Presidential race? Will a fresh candidate help Democrats regain the US presidency? Reports claimed on Friday that the incumbent US President is expected to make a significant announcement on his re-election bid and may step down as the Democratic nominee as early as this weekend. There has been no official confirmation of this.\n\nOn Tuesday, Biden created a flutter by saying that he could quit the presidential race if doctors found he had a medical condition. Biden, 81, has tested positive for COVID-19 earlier this week.\n\nAmid the growing Democrat revolt, campaign chair Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon said on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d on Friday that President Biden is \u201cabsolutely\u201d staying in the presidential race.\n\nEarlier, Biden said in a written statement from the Delaware beach home where he is recovering from COVID, \u201cThe stakes are high, and the choice is clear. Together, we will win.\"\n\nBut can Joe Biden drop out of the US presidential race? Yes, if Joe Biden willingly withdrew from the race. While this seems unlikely, a few elected Democrats have publicly urged him to end his reelection- bid.\n\nAccording to the Washington Times, former US President Barack Obama told allies that Biden's path to victory has greatly diminished. The report emerged after former US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was learned to have Joe Biden in a private conversation that he could not defeat Republican candidate Donald Trump.\n\nWhat happens if Joe Biden ends his reelection bid? If Biden does step down as the Democratic Party's presidential candidate, the move would set the stage for selecting a new candidate and will likely \"turn into free-for-all\" contest.\n\nThis means, there would be an open convention, where Democrats would suggest potential nominees. They may also continue voting until one receives the majority of delegate votes, BBC reported.\n\nThis might either lead to a contest among Democrats or Biden may get the final say in who replaces him.\n\nNotably, Joe Biden has not been officially nominated as the Democratic candidate for US Presidential polls, providing a crucial window for change, said Rishi Kumar, who describes himself as a \"Biden Delegate\" on X.\n\nWhat's the process for choosing new presidential candidate? According to the report, the party's nominee will then be officially chosen at the Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Chicago, which will take place from August 19 to 22.\n\nBut before the Democratic National Convention happens, over 4,000 \"pledged\" delegates will vote for their presidential nominee in a virtual roll call in early August. So if Biden ends his reelection bid before voting begins, those delegates could cast their ballots for a new candidate.\n\nNomination of a new candidate could take multiple voting rounds and strategic negotiations. The Democratic National Convention regulations state that if no candidate won a majority on that first ballot, more than 700 \"superdelegates\" are then allowed to vote.\n\n\"Balloting will continue until a nominee is selected...Eligible delegates may vote for the candidate of their choice whether or not the name of such candidate was placed in nomination,\" the ruled say. It may take several rounds of voting for one candidate to secure a majority.\n\nCan Biden be forced to end re-election bid? This is extremely rare. Realistically, at this stage in the campaign cycle, the only way Joe Biden can be replaced is if he agrees to drop out voluntarily or if he dies or suffers a \"disability\", CNBC reported.\n\nHowever, the 2024 Democratic National Convention regulations may use a loophole that could, in theory, make it possible to push Biden out. A rule says, \u201cAll delegates to the National Convention pledged to a presidential candidate shall in all good conscience reflect the sentiments of those who elected them.\u201d\n\nAlso Read | Joe Biden vacillating on presidential run after testing Covid positive?\n\nExperts told the BBC that they doubt there would be a revolt among Democratic party delegates. However, it's known that the Democratic National Convention can alter party rules at any point.\n\nMeanwhile, CNBC reported that realistically, the only way to replace Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket at this stage in the campaign cycle is if he agrees to drop out voluntarily or if he dies or suffers a \"disability.\"\n\nWho can replace Joe Biden? Experts view Vice President Kamala Harris as the likeliest choice to replace Joe Biden as several senior Democratic leaders suggest that he leave the race following his disastrous debate performance, a failed assassination attempt on his rival Donald Trump, his poor health, and falling poll numbers, according to media reports.\n\n\"The vice president is the logical choice, obviously,\" said Meena Bose, director of the Peter S. Kalikow Center for the Study of the American Presidency at Hofstra University, was quoted by CNBC as saying.\n\nAlso Read | Republicans step up attacks on Kamala Harris\n\nOther high-profile Democrats, such as California Governor Gavin Newsom or Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, are seen as potentially stronger alternatives to Harris.",

        "text": "Joe Biden pulls out of US presidential election race\nThe president has dropped his 2024 bid after weeks of pressure following a disastrous debate performance.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAfter weeks of pressure to reconsider his re-election campaign, US President Joe Biden has announced he is withdrawing as a candidate.\n\nIn a letter on his social media account on X Sunday, Biden said the decision \"is in the best interest of my party and the country\".\n\nBiden made clear he will serve out the remainder of his term, which expires in January 2025, and immediately endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\n\"My very first decision as the party nominee in 2020 was to pick Kamala Harris as my Vice President,\" he wrote. \"And it\u2019s been the best decision I\u2019ve made. Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year. Democrats \u2014 it\u2019s time to come together and beat Trump. Let\u2019s do this.\"\n\nOther names have been mentioned as potential replacements for Biden atop the Democratic ticket, but any prospective candidate would have to provide a clear rationale for a challenge against a black woman who would be the US's first female president.\n\nDonald Trump reacted to the news with a message on his bespoke social media platform, Truth Social, in which he said the \"crooked\" Biden \"was not fit to run for president, and is certainly not fit to serve - and never was!\"\n\n\"We will suffer greatly because of his presidency, but we will remedy the damage he has done very quickly,\" Trump wrote. \"MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\"\n\nThe end of an era\n\nDemands for the 81-year-old Biden to drop out surged after a televised debate with Trump on 27 June in which the president appeared physically and cognitively exhausted.\n\nHe struggled to rebut his opponent's often false claims, gave rambling answers of his own, and at times stared blankly into space.\n\nAfter the on-air debacle, Biden's allies briefed the media that he had been suffering from a cold, and he delivered a higher-energy speech at a campaign rally to regain the initiative.\n\nHowever, in subsequent interviews and public appearances meant to reassure voters and his own party that he was fit to stand, Biden frequently appeared tired.\n\nAs a result, more and more prominent Democrats began either declining to speculate on his future or explicitly calling for him to stand aside, even as others insisted they were behind him.\n\nA particularly dire moment came at a Washington summit marking the 75th anniversary of NATO. While Biden proved able to hold an extended press conference in which he held forth on a range of complex policy areas, he also referred to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as \"President Putin\" and his own vice president, Kamala Harris, as \"Vice President Trump\".\n\nAs it became clear that his effort to stem the tide was not succeeding, some of the party's most senior figures \u2014 including former House of Representatives speaker Nancy Pelosi \u2014 stopped short of calling on him to step down but began offering more equivocal answers the media when asked what he should do.\n\nA major intervention came from George Clooney, one of the Democrats' biggest donors, who wrote in the New York Times that \"the one battle (Biden) cannot win is the fight against time\".\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"It\u2019s devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe \u201cbig F-ing deal\u201d Biden of 2010. He wasn\u2019t even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\"\n\nOver the edge\n\nEven the attempted assassination of Donald Trump before the Republican convention did not dislodge the Biden story from the news cycle or stop the slow but steady drip of Democrats calling on him to drop out.\n\nMidway through the convention where Trump accepted the nomination, it was announced that Biden had been diagnosed with COVID-19, forcing him to go to his home in Delaware to recover.\n\nShortly after that news broke, Black Entertainment Television broadcast a pre-recorded interview in which the president appeared strikingly unwell and struggled to remember the name of his defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, instead referring to him as \"the black guy\".\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWith the Republican convention over, the Democratic Party's central machine appeared to be moving ahead with a plan to have Biden's nomination confirmed via a virtual roll call vote in advance of their own party's gathering in Chicago in September, thus forcing delegates to cast their votes for him as soon as possible.\n\nBut before that plan could be put into action, Biden announced he was dropping out.\n\nWhat now?\n\nIt has not yet been announced precisely what will happen at the Democratic convention or how Biden's successor as nominee will be chosen.\n\nThe obvious path is for the party to nominate VP Harris, putting her in line to be the US's first woman president. She has made more and more appearances on the campaign trail in recent months, and her polling numbers relative to Biden and Trump have improved of late.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOther popular and well-known Democrats have also been suggested as potential nominees, among them California Governor Gavin Newsom and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer.\n\nBut after several painful weeks spent pressuring Biden to drop out, it is not yet clear if anyone in the party will challenge Harris and risk another internal conflict.",

        "text": "Biden drops out of 2024 race after disastrous debate inflamed age concerns. VP Harris gets his nod\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 race for the White House on Sunday, ending his bid for reelection after a disastrous debate with Donald Trump that raised doubts about the incumbent\u2019s fitness for office. The unprecedented announcement, delivered less than four months before the election, immediately upended a campaign that both political parties view as the most consequential in generations.\n\nThe president \u2014 intent on serving out the remainder of his term in office \u2014 quickly endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to take on Trump and encouraged his party to unite behind her, making her the party\u2019s instant favorite for the nomination at its August convention in Chicago.\n\nThe announcement is the latest jolt to a tumultuous campaign for the White House, coming a week after the attempted assassination of Trump at a Pennsylvania rally.\n\nA party\u2019s presumptive presidential nominee has never stepped out of the race so close to the election. President Lyndon Johnson, besieged by the Vietnam War, announced in March 1968 that he would not seek another term after just a single state\u2019s primary. Biden\u2019s July decision comes after more than 14 million Democrats cast votes supporting him through the primary process.\n\nHarris, in a statement, praised Biden\u2019s \u201cselfless and patriotic act\u201d and said she intends to \u201cearn and win\u201d her party\u2019s nomination.\n\n\u201cI will do everything in my power to unite the Democratic Party \u2014 and unite our nation \u2014 to defeat Donald Trump and his extreme Project 2025 agenda,\u201d she said.\n\nBiden\u2019s decision to bow out came after escalating pressure from his Democratic allies to step aside following the June 27 debate, in which the 81-year-old president trailed off, often gave nonsensical answers and failed to call out the former president\u2019s many falsehoods.\n\n\u201cIt has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President. And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term,\u201d Biden wrote in a letter posted Sunday to his X account.\n\nNearly 30 minutes after he delivered the news that he was folding his campaign, Biden threw his support behind Harris.\n\n\u201cToday I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year,\u201d he said in another post on X. \u201cDemocrats \u2014 it\u2019s time to come together and beat Trump.\u201d\n\nHarris faces a staggering political to-do list in the coming days: securing the votes of delegates to claim her party\u2019s nomination, picking a running mate, and pivoting a massive political operation that had been built to reelect Biden to boost her candidacy instead. Harris, if elected, would be the first woman and the first person of South Asian descent to be president.\n\nThere were early signs that the party was moving to coalesce around Harris, who scored the endorsements of the Congressional Black Caucus and former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton even before she had commented on Biden\u2019s decision to quit the race. But notably, former President Barack Obama held off, pledging support behind the eventual party nominee.\n\n\u201cWe are honored to join the President in endorsing Vice President Harris and will do whatever we can to support her,\u201d the Clintons said in a statement.\n\nBut Obama, who had privately shared doubts about Biden\u2019s reelection chances, stopped short of endorsing Harris even as he praised Biden for his decision to leave the race.\n\n\u201cI have extraordinary confidence that the leaders of our party will be able to create a process from which an outstanding nominee emerges,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nBiden\u2019s decision came as he has been isolating at his Delaware beach house after being diagnosed with COVID-19 last week, huddling with a shrinking circle of close confidants and family members about his political future. Biden said he would address the nation later this week to provide \u201cdetail\u201d about his decision.\n\nHarris found out about Biden\u2019s plans on Sunday morning and senior campaign and White House staff were notified just minutes before the letter went out, according to people familiar with the matter who commented on the private discussions on condition of anonymity. Biden had been reflecting on his future for the past couple days and the decision was closely held.\n\nNow, Democrats have to urgently try to bring coherence to the nominating process in a matter of weeks and convince voters in a stunningly short amount of time that their nominee can handle the job and beat Trump. And for his part, Trump must shift his focus to a new opponent after years of training his attention on Biden.\n\nThe decision marks a swift and stunning end to Biden\u2019s 52 years in electoral politics, as donors, lawmakers and even aides expressed to him their doubts that he could convince voters that he could plausibly handle the job for another four years.\n\nBiden won the vast majority of delegates and every nominating contest but one, which would have made his nomination a formality. Now that he has dropped out, those delegates will be free to support another candidate.\n\nHarris, 59, appeared to be the natural successor, in large part because she is the only candidate who can directly tap into the Biden campaign\u2019s war chest, according to federal campaign finance rules.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign formally changed its name to Harris for President, reflecting that she is inheriting his political operation \u2014 a sign of the advantage she has in the race for the Democratic nomination. Democratic groups, including the Democratic National Committee, also filed paperwork changing the names of their joint fundraising committees to reflect Harris\u2019 candidacy.\n\nThe Democratic National Convention is scheduled to be held Aug. 19-22 in Chicago, but the party had announced it would hold a virtual roll call to formally nominate Biden before in-person proceedings begin.\n\nIt remained to be seen whether other candidates would challenge Harris for the nomination. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who had been discussed as a possible replacement for Biden last year, and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who challenged both Biden and Harris for the Democratic nomination in 2020, threw their support behind her Sunday.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee\u2019s chair, Jaime Harrison, said in a statement that the party would \u201cundertake a transparent and orderly process\u201d to select \u201ca candidate who can defeat Donald Trump in November.\u201d\n\nWest Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, who left the Democratic Party earlier this year to become an independent, is considering re-registering as a Democrat to vie for the nomination against the vice president, according to Jonathan Kott, a longtime adviser to Manchin.\n\nHarris was spending Sunday afternoon calling Democratic elected officials and delegates as she works to lock up the nomination.\n\nHarris received her first delegates for the Democratic presidential nomination on Sunday. The Tennessee Democratic Party posted on X that its delegation voted during a meeting Sunday to back Harris after Biden\u2019s departure from the campaign.\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly \u2014 each from a swing state and mentioned as a possible running mate for Harris \u2014 also endorsed Harris Sunday evening.\n\nTrump reacted to the news in a post on his Truth Social site, in which he said Biden \u201cwas not fit to run for President, and is certainly not fit to serve.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will suffer greatly because of his presidency, but we will remedy the damage he has done very quickly,\u201d he added. \u201cMAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\u201d\n\nWhile Trump and his team had made their preference for facing Biden clear, his campaign had nonetheless ramped up its attacks on Harris as pressure on Biden to step down intensified.\n\nDemocratic officials, including many who were behind the effort to push Biden from the race, quickly released statements praising Biden\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cHis decision of course was not easy, but he once again put his country, his party, and our future first,\u201d said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. \u201cJoe, today shows you are a true patriot and great American.\u201d\n\nHouse Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York praised Biden as \u201cone of the most accomplished and consequential leaders in American history.\u201d\n\nRepublican House Speaker Mike Johnson said Biden should immediately resign if he is not fit enough to run for office. In a statement, Johnson said, \u201cNovember 5 cannot arrive soon enough.\u201d\n\nIn addition to his planned address to the country, Biden still intends to host Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House this week, according to a person familiar with the president\u2019s schedule who was not authorized to comment publicly.\n\nThe exact timing of the meeting is still not set in stone as Biden continues to recover from COVID. Netanyahu is scheduled Wednesday to deliver an address to Congress and he is also expected to meet with Harris while in Washington.\n\nIn 2020, Biden pitched himself as a transitional figure who wanted to be a bridge to a new generation of leaders. But once he secured the job he spent decades struggling to attain, he was reluctant to part with it.\n\nBiden was once asked whether any other Democrats could beat Trump.\n\n\u201cProbably 50 of them,\u201d Biden replied. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not the only one who can defeat him, but I will defeat him.\u201d\n\nBiden is already the country\u2019s oldest president and had insisted repeatedly that he was up for the challenge of another campaign and another term, telling voters all they had to was \u201cwatch me.\u201d\n\nAnd watch him they did. His poor debate performance prompted a cascade of anxiety from Democrats and donors who said publicly what some had said privately for months, that they did not think he was up to the job for four more years.\n\nConcerns over Biden\u2019s age have dogged him since he announced he was running for reelection, though Trump is just three years younger at 78. Most Americans view the president as too old for a second term, according to an August 2023 poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. A majority also doubt his mental capability to be president, though that is also a weakness for Trump.\n\nBiden often remarked that he was not as young as he used to be, doesn\u2019t walk as easily or speak as smoothly, but that he had wisdom and decades of experience, which were worth a whole lot.\n\n\u201cI give you my word as a Biden. I would not be running again if I didn\u2019t believe with all my heart and soul I can do this job,\u201d he told supporters at a rally in North Carolina a day after the debate. \u201cBecause, quite frankly, the stakes are too high.\u201d\n\nBut voters had other problems with him, too \u2014 he has been deeply unpopular as a leader even as his administration steered the nation through recovery from a global pandemic, presided over a booming economy and passed major pieces of bipartisan legislation that will impact the nation for years to come. A majority of Americans disapprove of the way he\u2019s handling his job, and he\u2019s faced persistently low approval ratings on key issues including the economy and immigration.\n\nBiden\u2019s motivation for running was deeply intertwined with Trump. He had retired from public service following eight years serving as vice president under Obama and the death of his son Beau but decided to run after Trump\u2019s comments following a \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017, when white supremacists descended on the city to protest the removal of its Confederate memorials.\n\nTrump said: \u201cYou had some very bad people in the group, but you also had people that were very fine people on both sides. On both sides.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s wife, first lady Jill Biden, responded to the president\u2019s announcement by reposting Biden\u2019s letter announcing his decision and adding red heart emojis.\n\nGranddaughter Naomi Biden Neal said on social media, \u201cI\u2019m nothing but proud of my Pop.\u201d She said he has served the country \u201cwith every bit of his soul and with unmatched distinction\u201d and \u201cour world is better today in so many ways thanks to him.\u201d\n\n___\n\nSuperville reported from Rehoboth Beach, Delaware.

And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term,\u201d Biden wrote.\n\nHis initial statement did not include an endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris, but he followed up a few minutes later with an expression of support.\n\nHarris, 59, would become the first Black woman to run at the top of a major party ticket in the country\u2019s history.\n\nBiden\u2019s historic move \u2013 the first sitting president to give up his party\u2019s nomination for re-election since President Lyndon Johnson in March 1968 \u2013 leaves his replacement with less than four months to wage a campaign.\n\nBiden\u2019s gaffes\n\nThe Democratic backlash against Biden came after he delivered an unsteady performance at the first presidential debate of the 2024 election season as he lost his train of thought and struggled to articulate basic talking points.\n\nBiden\u2019s failure at times to complete clear sentences took the public spotlight away from Trump\u2019s performance, in which he made a string of false statements, and trained it instead on questions surrounding Biden\u2019s fitness for another term.\n\nDays later, he raised fresh concerns in an interview, shrugging off Democrats\u2019 worries and a widening gap in opinion polls, and saying he would be fine losing to Trump if he knew he would \u201cgave it my all\u201d.\n\nHis gaffes at a NATO summit \u2013 invoking Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s name when he meant Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and calling Harris \u201cVice President Trump\u201d \u2013 further stoked anxieties.\n\nOnly four days before Sunday\u2019s announcement, Biden was diagnosed with COVID-19 for a third time, forcing him to cut short a campaign trip to Las Vegas. More than one in 10 congressional Democrats had called publicly for him to quit the race.\n\nThe 46th US president\u2019s departure from the race leaves the Democratic Party in an unprecedented situation, with only a month until the Democratic National Convention and less than four months until the November 5 election.\n\nIt was unclear whether other senior Democrats would challenge Harris for the party\u2019s nomination \u2013 she was widely seen as the pick for many party officials \u2013 or whether the party itself would choose to open the field for nominations.\n\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Mike Hanna, reporting from Washington, DC, said Biden had been under a lot of pressure recently.\n\n\u201cIt is very difficult to say what made him make the decision now,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhat we do know is that he has been repeatedly insistent that he would not step down \u2026 So it comes as a bit of a surprise and a bit of a shock that Biden is saying he will step down after weeks of saying he won\u2019t.\u201d",

Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n\nDonald Trump was joined by his newly minted running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, on Saturday at the former president\u2019s first campaign rally since the attempt to assassinate him last weekend.\n\nThe two were greeted by an amped up crowd at an indoor arena in Grand Rapids, Michigan.\n\nHere\u2019s what happened:\n\nNew running mate: Vance, who fired up the crowd ahead of Trump\u2019s remarks, said, \u201cI gotta be honest, it\u2019s still a little bit weird seeing my name on those signs,\u201d referring to the Trump-Vance campaign material waving behind him in the audience.\n\nVance defended his loyalty to the US, after Vice President Kamala Harris said he \u201cwill be loyal only to Trump, not to our country.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s some bad news actually, Vice President Kamala Harris, she doesn\u2019t like me,\u201d Vance said in remarks about two hours before Trump took the stage. \u201cKamala Harris said something to the effect that \u2026 I have no loyalty to this country,\u201d he continued. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know, Kamala, I did serve in the United States Marine Corps and build a business. What the hell have you done other than collect a check?\u201d\n\nBefore the vice presidency, Harris was the district attorney of San Francisco, California\u2019s attorney general, and then the state\u2019s junior senator.\n\nVance later came back out to introduce Trump for a roaring crowd.\n\nOn the rally shooting: Trump, who wore a smaller, beige-colored bandage on his ear, said he \u201ctook a bullet for democracy.\u201d\n\nThe former president, who spoke for nearly two hours, thanked the staff at Butler Memorial Hospital, where he was taken minutes after the shooting at his rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nRep. Ronny Jackson, the former White House physician, said Saturday that Trump is \u201crecovering as expected\u201d from a gunshot wound to his ear. Investigations into the rally shooter and handling of security at the event continue.\n\nTrump noted in his first joint interview with Vance that people at his rally last weekend noticed there was someone on the roof before the assassination attempt.\n\nSupport from Musk: Trump said he spoke to tech billionaire Elon Musk before coming to the Grand Rapids rally. The former president said Musk didn\u2019t mention reporting from The Wall Street Journal that he will be committing around $45 million a month to a pro-Trump super PAC.\n\n\u201cElon endorsed me the other day, and I read, I didn\u2019t even know this, he didn\u2019t even tell me about it, but he gives me $45 million a month,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd I talked to him just a little while ago to say I was coming here, how you doing, and he didn\u2019t even mention it.\u201d\n\nAbout world leaders: Trump said Chinese President Xi Jinping and other world leaders wrote to him after the assassination attempt. He said he \u201cgot along very well with President Xi, who\u2019s a great guy,\u201d and claimed that he worked well with other world leaders, too, even though they understood during his presidency that the \u201cjig was up\u201d in terms of taking advantage of the US on a world stage.\n\nBiden campaign\u2019s response: President Joe Biden\u2019s reelection campaign blasted Trump\u2019s remarks at the rally, saying Trump is \u201cfocused only on himself.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s peddling the same lies, running the same campaign of revenge and retribution, touting the same failed policies, and \u2013 as usual \u2013 focused only on himself. The only unity we saw today was between Donald Trump, JD Vance, and their Project 2025 agenda,\u201d Biden campaign spokesperson Ammar Moussa said in a statement.\n\nProject 2025 refers to the policy blueprint created by a conservative think tank. Democrats have latched on to some of the document\u2019s controversial right-wing proposals, while Trump has tried to distance himself from the platform, despite dozens of people from his former administration having a hand in its creation.",

        "text": "Biden endorses Kamala Harris as US presidential nominee. What happens next?\nAs the US president bows out amid concerns over his age, Democrats face the challenge of finding a new candidate for the November election.\n\nUnited States President Joe Biden\u2019s withdrawal from the 2024 presidential race has left Democrats grappling with unanswered questions about the way forward, with less than four months before election day.\n\nBiden stepped aside on Sunday after weeks of pressure from fellow Democrats following a disastrous debate performance against former President Donald Trump in June.\n\nNow, Democrats need to coalesce around a new nominee and re-energise their base if they want to defeat Trump, analysts say. Vice President Kamala Harris is an early favourite to replace Biden, especially after she received the president\u2019s endorsement. Biden also encouraged donors to contribute to Harris for her campaign.\n\nStill, Biden\u2019s decision to withdraw is not merely unusual \u2014 it is unprecedented in modern US politics. \u201cWe\u2019re in uncharted territory here,\u201d said Kyle Kondik, the managing editor for the Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball, a newsletter about elections published by the University of Virginia Center for Politics.\n\nAnd Harris could face challengers seeking the Democratic nomination in the coming days.\n\nThe new nominee will be chosen at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago next month, when more than 4,000 party officials and activists, known as delegates, gather to vote.\n\nThere have been instances where parties have chosen their candidates in competitive conventions after the primaries. In fact, that happened frequently before the modern primary system was put in place in 1972, granting voters a greater say in the process.\n\nBut the Democrats\u2019 current situation is different.\n\nHaving won nearly all pledged delegates, Biden is now the first presumptive nominee of a major party to quit the race after the primaries have concluded.\n\nThe president ran in the primaries without any serious challengers and Democratic officials stressed early on that Biden \u2013 as the incumbent \u2013 will be the likely nominee.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really think there\u2019s any good recent precedent for it. Half a century or more ago, it wasn\u2019t uncommon to go into the convention not necessarily knowing for sure who the nominee was going to be,\u201d Kondik, who spoke to Al Jazeera earlier this week, said.\n\n\u201cBut since then, we haven\u2019t had this sort of situation where somebody dominates the primary season \u2013 but then steps aside later, in advance of the convention.\u201d\n\nWith no historical precedent to follow, Democrats will have to improvise within their guidelines on how to choose their new nominee, analysts say.\n\nWhile the change comes with risks, a new candidate could galvanise Democratic voters who had previously resigned themselves to the uphill battle of taking on Trump at a time when his lead over Biden had widened across battleground states.\n\nBefore dropping out, Biden was set to face Republican nominee Trump for the second presidential election in a row.\n\nMeena Bose, a professor of political science at Hofstra University, said that while it is risky to change candidates so close to the elections, a shake-up at the top of the Democratic ticket could boost the party\u2019s chances.\n\n\u201cA late change is not ideal but may bring more optimism than no change at all or, at the very least, might potentially be helpful down the ballot, if not in the presidential race,\u201d Bose said.\n\nPresidential endorsement\n\nSoon after Biden announced his departure from the race, he endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to replace him at the top of the Democratic Party ticket.\n\nKondik said Biden\u2019s endorsement makes a big difference. The president has the support of the overwhelming majority of delegates. And while they are not bound to back Harris, Biden\u2019s backing could tip the scales in her favour. In the hours that followed Biden\u2019s announcement, a flood of leading Democrats publicly endorsed Harris \u2013 from Senator Elizabeth Warren and state leaders of the Democratic Party to governors who were seen as potential rivals for the nomination, such as California\u2019s Gavin Newsom and Pennsylvania\u2019s Josh Shapiro.\n\nThe vice president also has national name recognition and can inherit the Biden-Harris campaign infrastructure.\n\nKondik said that nominating Harris was the \u201cpath of least resistance\u201d for Democrats. Bose echoed that assessment, saying that Harris was the most \u201clogical choice\u201d to ensure a \u201cseamless transition\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere is not a lot of time for an open competition for delegate support,\u201d she told Al Jazeera.\n\nHans Noel, a professor at Georgetown University\u2019s Department of Government, also said on Friday \u2013 before Biden\u2019s announcement \u2013 that Harris was projected to take over the nomination.\n\n\u201cThe vice presidential candidate does not automatically become the presidential candidate, but I think a lot of voters would sort of expect that,\u201d Noel told Al Jazeera in an email.\n\n\u201cGiven that she\u2019s in that position, there are a lot of reasons not to go to someone else. She does have a lot of support in the party, but more importantly, nominating someone else would look like skipping over a Black woman, which would not look good for many in the party.\u201d\n\nThe rules for the Democratic National Committee state that delegates can propose a new party nominee if they obtain the signatures of 300 fellow delegates, along with a signature of confirmation from the proposed candidate. But the party will, in all likelihood, coalesce around Harris to present a united front.\n\nLingering questions\n\nThe Democratic Party now faces the anxiety-inducing question of how voters will respond to Biden\u2019s departure from the presidential race, a considerable shake-up so close to the election.\n\nUS presidential campaigns require massive investments of cash and manpower to reach people across the country. Some start as early as two years in advance. Launching a campaign from scratch will not be easy.\n\n\u201cCampaigns take huge amounts of infrastructure, money [and] messaging to get through to the voters that we know are most undecided,\u201d said Casey Burgat, the director of the legislative affairs programme at George Washington University.\n\nBurgat explained that reaching undecided voters is also labour-intensive: \u201cYou need to hit them several times. You need to have people knocking on doors. There\u2019s just a huge infrastructure to be built.\u201d\n\nWhat happens to the campaign funds Biden amassed is also a source of uncertainty. With no precedent for the current situation, questions have swirled over the fate of Biden\u2019s war chest.\n\nIn the US, after all, election spending can run into millions, if not billions, of dollars.\n\nBut Burgat noted that campaign finance restrictions are less of an issue for Harris since she is already on the ticket as Biden\u2019s vice president and has been part of his fundraising efforts.\n\nChallenges and opportunities\n\nHowever, if Biden\u2019s exit has drawbacks, it also presents opportunities. Many voters had been unenthused about the prospect of an election between Biden and Trump.\n\nBefore Biden\u2019s announcement, a recent poll from The Associated Press and the NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that 65 percent of Democrats believed he should exit the race.\n\nJust three in 10 expressed confidence that he had the mental acuity necessary to serve effectively as president.\n\nBurgat says that a new, younger candidate could have an energising effect and give the party a much-needed boost.\n\n\u201cThe most common thing we\u2019ve heard is: \u2018I can\u2019t believe these are our two options.\u2019 People have been wondering how, in this country of 350 million people, their choice has been reduced to these two very unpopular candidates,\u201d he said.\n\nDemocrats in competitive congressional districts had grown especially worried that Biden\u2019s unpopularity could stymie candidates up and down the ballot, lowering their chances in races that might otherwise be winnable.\n\nRecent polling pointed to an alarming trend in that direction. The Wall Street Journal reported that a poll by Blue Rose Research suggested that more than half of swing voters believed Democrats had been lying about Biden\u2019s mental fitness.\n\nNearly 30 percent of voters who supported Biden in 2020 felt the same way, too, according to the poll.\n\nDemocrats may fear that playing down Biden\u2019s age could tarnish their credibility with voters and do long-term damage to the party. According to Burgat, that contributed to the pressure that informed Biden\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cDemocrats will be able to say, and rightfully so, that things change when there are widespread concerns about a candidate,\u201d said Burgat. \u201cThey can make the case that this job \u2013 this election \u2013 is too important to ignore those concerns.\u201d",

        "text": "President Joe Biden drops out of 2024 presidential race\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Joe Biden announced Sunday that he will end his presidential re-election campaign, bringing an abrupt and humbling conclusion to his half-century-long political career and scrambling the race for the White House less than four months before Election Day.\n\nBiden, 81, could not reverse growing sentiment within his party that he was too frail to serve and destined to lose to Donald Trump in November. He backed Vice President Kamala Harris to replace him as the Democratic nominee.\n\n\u201cWhile it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term,\u201d Biden wrote in a letter posted on X. \u201cI will speak to the Nation later this week in more detail about my decision.\u201d\n\nBiden thanked Harris for \u201cbeing an extraordinary partner\u201d in his letter and then endorsed her in a subsequent post.\n\n\u201cMy very first decision as the party nominee in 2020 was to pick Kamala Harris as my Vice President,\u201d Biden posted. \u201cAnd it\u2019s been the best decision I\u2019ve made. Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year.\u201d\n\nBiden and Harris spoke multiple times Sunday ahead of the president\u2019s announcement, according to a source familiar with the campaign.\n\nIn a statement, Harris thanked Biden for \u201chis extraordinary leadership\u201d and his \u201cremarkable legacy of achievement.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am honored to have the President\u2019s endorsement and my intention is to earn and win this nomination,\u201d Harris said. \u201cI will do everything in my power to unite the Democratic Party \u2014 and unite our nation \u2014 to defeat Donald Trump and his extreme Project 2025 agenda,\u201d she said.\n\nBiden \u2014 who for weeks had insisted publicly that he planned to stay in the race \u2014 told his senior team he had changed his mind about continuing his campaign at 1:45 p.m. ET, according to a source with direct knowledge. The tweet announcing his decision was sent at 1:46 p.m.\n\nHis withdrawal caps a singular national political career, bookended by Richard Nixon\u2019s fall and Trump\u2019s rise. He mounted four presidential bids. He spent 36 years in the U.S. Senate representing tiny Delaware. He rose to the chairmanships of the powerful Judiciary and Foreign Relations committees. And he served eight years as Barack Obama\u2019s vice president.\n\n'Great public servant'\n\nReactions from politicians quickly began pouring in.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom wrote in a post on X that Biden \u201chas been an extraordinary, history-making president \u2014 a leader who has fought hard for working people and delivered astonishing results for all Americans.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe will go down in history as one of the most impactful and selfless presidents,\u201d said Newsom, who was one of the most prominent Biden surrogates. Newsom has been floated as a possible Democratic presidential contender, but threw his support behind Harris hours after the announcement, saying in a post on X that \"no one is better to prosecute the case against Donald Trump\u2019s dark vision and guide our country in a healthier direction than America\u2019s Vice President, @KamalaHarris.\"\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, another prominent Democrat talked about as a future national candidate, called Biden a \u201cgreat public servant\u201d in a post on X.\n\n\u201cMy job in this election will remain the same: doing everything I can to elect Democrats and stop Donald Trump, a convicted felon whose agenda of raising families\u2019 costs, banning abortion nationwide, and abusing the power of the White House to settle his own scores is completely wrong for Michigan,\u201d Whitmer wrote.\n\nFirst lady Jill Biden reposted her husband's announcement with heart emojis. \u201cDown to the last hours of the decision only he could make, she was supportive of whatever road he chose,\" said her communications director, Elizabeth Alexander.\n\nAcross the aisle, Republicans slammed the move and many called on him to resign from office, days after the completion of a Republican National Convention where speaker after speaker slammed the Biden-Harris ticket.\n\n\u201cIf Joe Biden is not fit to run for president, he is not fit to serve as President. He must resign the office immediately,\u201d said House Speaker Mike Johnson.\n\nIn a brief phone interview with NBC News, Trump reacted to Biden\u2019s decision, calling the president \u201cthe worst president in the history of the United States by far.\u201d\n\nWhen asked whether he was surprised by Biden\u2019s decision, Trump said that Biden \u201cshould never have been there in the first place.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe should have stayed in his basement,\u201d Trump said.\n\nIn a fundraising email, Trump\u2019s campaign said that Biden \u201cquit the race in complete disgrace.\u201d\n\nAn unprecedented decision\n\nBiden\u2019s decision to exit the race less than a month before his party\u2019s convention and a few months before voters head to the polls is unprecedented in the modern political era. The last sitting president to abandon a re-election bid was Lyndon Johnson, whose expansion of the Vietnam War in the 1960s split the Democratic Party. But Johnson\u2019s announcement came in March 1968 \u2014 eight months before that election.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in uncharted waters,\u201d said Barbara Perry, a presidential studies professor at the University of Virginia\u2019s Miller Center. \u201cNo president has dropped out or died this close to the convention.\u201d\n\nReplacing Biden atop the Democratic ticket is likely to set off internal Democratic tremors as ambitious officials maneuver to become his successor. Factions have already formed around Harris, Whitmer and Newsom.\n\nHarris, who at 59 is 22 years younger than Biden, would seem to be the heir apparent. She broke a barrier as the first female vice president. A woman of color, she enjoys strong support among African Americans, a loyal piece of the Democratic coalition. Overall, though, Harris\u2019 approval rating stood at only 32% in an NBC News poll released earlier this month.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no one you can name right now who is an obvious substitute,\u201d Perry said. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes this so uncertain and chaotic.\u201d\n\nUnlike Republican delegates, who are bound to their candidate, Democratic delegates aren\u2019t, so they are free to do what they want at the convention. Biden could have some influence over the delegates, but they could vote for a different candidate than his chosen pick, pending any rule changes at the convention meant to address this unprecedented situation. The rules currently say that the delegates simply have to \u201cin all good conscience reflect the sentiments of those who elected them.\u201d\n\nDemocratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison said in a statement: \u201cIn the coming days, the Party will undertake a transparent and orderly process to move forward as a united Democratic Party with a candidate who can defeat Donald Trump in November. This process will be governed by established rules and procedures of the Party. Our delegates are prepared to take seriously their responsibility in swiftly delivering a candidate to the American people.\u201d\n\nThe mechanics of putting a new name on ballots also gives rise to myriad legal questions. Republicans could work to throw obstacles in the nominee\u2019s path by mounting legal challenges aimed at keeping that person off the ballot.\n\nJohnson, the House speaker, said in an interview on CNN Sunday before Biden's announcement that \u201cI think they have got legal hurdles in some of these states, and it\u2019ll be litigated.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey have got a real problem,\u201d he added.\n\nSupport for Harris\n\nDemocratic congressional leadership did not immediately back Harris, but many high-profile lawmakers did join Biden in rallying around the vice president, including Reps. James Clyburn of South Carolina, Jamie Raskin of Maryland, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Adam Schiff and Eric Swalwell of California, and Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Chris Coons of Delaware, Chris Murphy of Connecticut and Mark Kelly of Arizona.\n\nCongressional Black Caucus chairman Rep. Steven Horsford, D-Nev., and Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., the chair of the group\u2019s PAC, said they join Biden in \u201cfully supporting\u201d Harris to be the Democratic presidential nominee.\n\n\u201cI know one thing, I will only work for @KamalaHarris!\u201d Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, said in a post on X shortly before Biden endorsed Harris. \u201cIf it\u2019s anyone OTHER than her, enjoy campaign season.\u201d\n\nSen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, said in a statement that \u201cI look forward to doing everything in my power to get her elected to the White House, so we can continue building on the progress of the last four years.\u201d\n\nTransportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who ran for president in 2020, endorsed Harris as well, saying, \"I will do all that I can to help elect her.\"\n\nFormer President Barack Obama did not immediately endorse Harris. \u201cWe will be navigating uncharted waters in the days ahead. But I have extraordinary confidence that the leaders of our party will be able to create a process from which an outstanding nominee emerges,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nHarris\u2019s fledgling campaign gave Democrats an immediate jolt from small-dollar donors. ActBlue, the main Democratic online fundraising platform, reported that the groups using it raised $27.5 million in the first five hours of her campaign. (Not all of that money flowed to Harris, though it's likely that a lot of it did.)\n\nDebate spurred calls for Biden to end his run\n\nQuestions about Biden\u2019s capacities dogged him throughout his presidency, but peaked following his debate with Trump on June 27. Combined with his flagging poll numbers, his listless performance sparked a panic among his own party that he couldn\u2019t win in November.\n\nWith 51 million people watching, Biden spoke in a raspy voice and often failed to complete thoughts or deliver a cogent explanation of why voters should choose him over Trump. He later attributed his poor performance to exhaustion and a cold. He implored the country not to let one bad night overshadow his accomplishments in office.\n\nUnpersuaded, Democratic lawmakers began calling on him to step aside, a rebellion that started slowly but grew steadily in size and intensity. Thirty-seven congressional Democrats, including independent Sen. Joe Manchin, who previously was in the Democratic Party, had called on Biden to drop out of the 2024 election before he delivered his decision Sunday afternoon.\n\nThey appealed to Biden\u2019s patriotism, arguing that if he sincerely believed Trump is a threat to democracy, he needed to put his country first and stand down.\n\nBiden fought back. He held numerous calls and meetings with Democratic officials at all levels to shore up support inside the party \u2014 to no avail.\n\nLooking to blunt concerns about his acuity, he gave interviews and held press conferences to prove to voters that he could still think on his feet. But the gaffes kept coming and his poll numbers remained stagnant.\n\nIn another bit of bad fortune and timing, Biden tested positive for Covid-19 on July 17, forcing him off the campaign trail.\n\nFor Democrats, Biden\u2019s illness created an unwanted contrast. While Trump delivered a triumphal speech accepting the Republican nomination in Milwaukee on July 18, five days after surviving an assassination attempt, Biden was in self-isolation back home.\n\nTrump rebound\n\nBiden\u2019s departure is the latest in a series of jarring developments that has made the 2024 presidential race the most chaotic in living memory. Trump easily won the Republican presidential nomination despite splitting his time between the campaign trail and various courtrooms where he was a defendant in criminal and civil cases. In May, a jury in Manhattan convicted him on 34 felony counts related to hush money payments to a porn star.\n\nThen, in short order, Trump rebounded. The Supreme Court issued a much-anticipated ruling on July 1 that immunized Trump from official conduct when he was president, impeding special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s efforts to prosecute Trump for interfering in the 2020 election.\n\nTrump nearly died on July 13 as he appeared at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. A gunman lying on a roof 130 yards away fired a bullet that grazed his ear. Trump dropped to the ground in self-defense. Then, his face smeared with blood, he rose and defiantly pumped his fist, yelling \u201cFight!\u201d\n\nAnother fortuitous development came two days later, coinciding with the opening of the Republican convention in Milwaukee that certified Trump\u2019s nomination. U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon in Florida dismissed a separate case brought by Smith alleging that Trump improperly retained classified documents that he took home with him when he left the White House in 2021. Cannon, who had been appointed by Trump, ruled that Smith\u2019s appointment was illegal. Smith quickly appealed her ruling.\n\nThe rolling streak of news gave Trump a jolt of momentum, allowing Republicans to present an energized and unified front at this month\u2019s convention.\n\nBiden seldom sparked any such enthusiasm. HIs primary campaign was mostly a coronation. He faced token opposition as party leaders cleared the field, betting that having beaten Trump once before, Biden was best positioned to do it again. But poll after poll confirmed that voters harbored doubts about him, believing he was too old and infirm to serve another term.\n\nAn AP-NORC survey released July 17 found that a whopping 65% of Democrats believed Biden should exit the race.\n\nPressed by his voters, abandoned by party leaders, Biden gave in.",

        "text": "How Biden\u2019s withdrawal affects foreign policy challenges as the world watches the U.S. election\nJoe Biden\u2019s withdrawal from the U.S. presidential race injects greater uncertainty into the world at a time when Western leaders are grappling with wars in Ukraine and Gaza, a more assertive China in Asia and the rise of the far-right in Europe.\n\nDuring a five-decade career in politics, Biden developed extensive personal relationships with multiple foreign leaders that none of the potential replacements on the Democratic ticket can match. After his announcement, messages of support and gratitude for his years of service poured in from near and far.\n\nREAD MORE: What political leaders have said about Biden\u2019s decision to end his reelection bid\n\nThe scope of foreign policy challenges facing the next U.S. president makes clear how consequential what happens in Washington is for the rest of the planet. Here\u2019s a look at some of them.\n\nIsrael\n\nWith Vice President Kamala Harris being eyed as a potential replacement for Biden, Israelis on Sunday scrambled to understand what her candidacy would mean for their country as it confronts increasing global isolation over its military campaign against Hamas.\n\nIsrael\u2019s left-wing Haaretz daily newspaper ran a story scrutinizing Harris\u2019 record of support for Israel, pointing to her reputation as Biden\u2019s \u201cbad cop\u201d who has vocally admonished Israel for its offensive in Gaza. In recent months, she has gone further than Biden in calling for a cease-fire, denouncing Israel\u2019s invasion of Rafah and expressing horror over the civilian death toll in Gaza.\n\nREAD MORE: Biden and Netanyahu will still meet during Israeli prime minister\u2019s U.S. visit, source says\n\n\u201cWith Biden leaving, Israel has lost perhaps the last Zionist president,\u201d said Alon Pinkas, a former Israeli consul general in New York. \u201cA new Democratic candidate will upend the dynamic.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s staunch defense of Israel since Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 attack has its roots in his half-century of support for the country as a senator, vice president, then president. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant thanked Biden for his \u201cunwavering support of Israel over the years.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour steadfast backing, especially during the war, has been invaluable,\u201d Gallant wrote on X.\n\nIsraeli President Isaac Herzog praised Biden as a \u201csymbol of the unbreakable bond between our two peoples\u201d and a \u201ctrue ally of the Jewish people.\u201d There was no immediate reaction from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, an ally of former President Donald Trump whose history of cordial relations with Biden has come under strain during the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nUkraine\n\nAny Democratic candidate would likely continue Biden\u2019s legacy of staunch military support for Ukraine. But frustration with the Biden administration has grown in Ukraine and Europe over the slow pace of U.S. aid and restrictions on the use of Western weapons.\n\n\u201cMost Europeans realize that Ukraine is increasingly going to be their burden,\u201d said Sudha David-Wilp, director of the Berlin office of the German Marshall Fund, a research institute. \u201cEveryone is trying to get ready for all the possible outcomes.\u201d\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on X that he respected the \u201ctough but strong decision\u201d by Biden to drop out of the campaign, and he thanked Biden for his help \u201cin preventing (Russian President Vladimir) Putin from occupying our country.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Zelenskyy: Ukraine \u2018will always be thankful\u2019 for Biden\u2019s leadership\n\nTrump has promised to end Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine in one day if he is elected \u2014 a prospect that has raised fears in Ukraine that Russia might be allowed to keep the territory it occupies.\n\nTrump\u2019s vice presidential pick, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, is among Congress\u2019 most vocal opponents of U.S. aid for Ukraine and has further raised the stakes for Kyiv.\n\nRussia, meanwhile, dismissed the importance of the race, insisting that no matter what happened, Moscow would press on in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cWe need to pay attention,\u201d Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was quoted as saying by a pro-Russian tabloid. \u201cWe need to watch what will happen and do our own thing.\u201d\n\nChina\n\nIn recent months, both Biden and Trump have tried to show voters who can best stand up to Beijing\u2019s growing military strength and belligerence and protect U.S. businesses and workers from low-priced Chinese imports. Biden has hiked tariffs on electric vehicles from China, and Trump has promised to implement tariffs of 60 percent on all Chinese products.\n\nTrump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d doctrine exacerbated tensions with Beijing. But disputes with the geopolitical rival and economic colossus over wars, trade, technology and security continued into Biden\u2019s term.\n\nChina\u2019s official reaction to the U.S. presidential race has been careful. The official Xinhua news agency treated the story of Biden\u2019s decision as relatively minor. The editor of the party-run Global Times newspaper, Hu Xijin, downplayed the impact of Biden\u2019s withdrawal.\n\n\u201cWhoever becomes the presidential candidate of the Democratic Party may be the same,\u201d he wrote on X. \u201cVoters are divided into two groups, Trump voters and Trump haters.\u201d\n\nIran\n\nWith Iran\u2019s proxies across the Middle East increasingly entangled in the Israel-Hamas war, the U.S. confronts a region in disarray.\n\nYemen\u2019s Iran-backed Houthis struck Tel Aviv for the first time last week, prompting retaliatory Israeli strikes inside war-torn Yemen. Simmering tensions and cross-border attacks between Lebanon\u2019s Iran-backed Hezbollah militant group and the Israeli military have raised fears of an all-out regional conflagration.\n\nHamas, which also receives support from Iran, continues to fight Israel even nine months into a war that has killed 38,000 Palestinians and displaced over 80 percent of Gaza\u2019s population.\n\nThe U.S. and its allies have accused Iran of expanding its nuclear program and enriching uranium to an unprecedented 60 percent level, near-weapons-grade levels.\n\nAfter then-President Trump in 2018 withdrew from Tehran\u2019s landmark nuclear deal with world powers, Biden said he wanted to reverse his predecessor\u2019s hawkish anti-Iran stance. But the Biden administration has maintained severe economic sanctions against Iran and overseen failed attempts to renegotiate the agreement.\n\nThe sudden death of Ebrahim Raisi \u2014 the supreme leader\u2019s hard-line protege \u2014 in a helicopter crash vaulted a new reformist to the presidency in Iran, generating new opportunities and risks. Masoud Pezeshkian has said he wants to help Iran open up to the world but has maintained a defiant tone against the U.S.\n\nEurope and NATO\n\nMany Europeans were happy to see Trump go after his years of disparaging the European Union and undermining NATO. Trump\u2019s seemingly dismissive attitude toward European allies in last month\u2019s presidential debate did nothing to assuage those concerns.\n\nBiden, on the other hand, has supported close American relations with bloc leaders.\n\nThat closeness was on stark display after Biden\u2019s decision to bow out of the race. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk called his choice \u201cprobably the most difficult one in your life.\u201d The newly installed British prime minister, Keir Starmer, said he respected Biden\u2019s \u201cdecision based on what he believes is in the best interests of the American people.\u201d\n\nWATCH: German Chancellor Scholz on NATO\u2019s future, supporting Ukraine and working with Biden\n\nThere was also an outpouring of affection from Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris, who called Biden a \u201cproud American with an Irish soul.\u201d\n\nThe question of whether NATO can maintain its momentum in supporting Ukraine and checking the ambitions of other authoritarian states hangs in the balance of this presidential election, analysts say.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want to see Donald Trump as president. So there\u2019s quite a bit of relief but also quite a bit of nervousness\u201d about Biden\u2019s decision to drop out, said Jeremy Shapiro, research director of the European Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cLike many in the United States, but perhaps more so, they are really quite confused.\u201d\n\nMexico\n\nThe close relationship between Mexico and the U.S. has been marked in recent years by disagreements over trade, energy and climate change. Since President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador took power in 2018, both countries have found common ground on issue of migration \u2013 with Mexico making it more difficult for migrants to cross its country to the U.S. border and the U.S. not pressing on other issues.\n\nThe L\u00f3pez Obrador administration kept that policy while Trump was president and continued it into Biden\u2019s term.\n\nOn Friday, Mexico\u2019s president called Trump \u201ca friend\u201d and said he would write to him to warn him against pledging to close the border or blaming migrants for bringing drugs into the United States.\n\n\u201cI am going to prove to him that migrants don\u2019t carry drugs to the United States,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cclosing the border won\u2019t solve anything, and anyway, it can\u2019t be done.\u201d\n\nAssociated Press writers Jill Lawless in London, Daria Litvinova in Talinn, Estonia, and Josh Goodman in Miami contributed to this report.\n\nFind more coverage",

        "text": "The 24 days that turned the 2024 presidential election upside down\nA look at Biden's path to stepping down from the 2024 election.\n\nIn just 24 days, the 2024 presidential election has been turned upside down.\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Sunday dropped out of the race, just over three weeks after his widely criticized poor showing in a June 27 debate against former President Donald Trump. Biden's uneven performance led to questions from the Democratic party and others about his age, cognitive health, his ability to beat Trump, and whether he was able to serve a second term.\n\nHere's a look at how the Biden campaign reached this historic decision to end Biden's candidacy for a second term.\n\nThe first debate\n\nBiden, who at 81 is the oldest sitting president in history, had already been facing concerns about his age before the CNN debate against Trump on June 27. However, Biden's debate performance increased questions not only about his ability to win against Trump, but his ability to execute his duties as president for another term.\n\nThe president's performance -- marred by a hoarse voice, often meandering answers, and a lack of strong attacks against Trump on key issues -- left some Democrats calling for him to step down.\n\nPresident Joe Biden addresses the nation from the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, July 14, 2024. Erin Schaff/AP\n\nPolls prompt further questions\n\nThe debate quickly hurt Biden's campaign. The two candidates were just about tied on the day of the debate, according to 538's national polling average. After the debate, Trump led Biden by two percentage points.\n\nAmid the scrutiny, Vice President Kamala Harris, whom Biden endorsed as his party's nominee in Sunday's statement announcing the end of his candidacy, had already emerged as a likely top contender to replace Biden.\n\nIn an Ipsos poll about a potential matchup between Harris and former President Donald Trump, released on July 2, Harris and Trump were nearly tied, with 42% supporting her and 43% supporting the former president\n\nAnother poll released by CNN in the first week of July found that a matchup between the vice president and Trump resulted in a 45-47% split between Harris and Trump, compared to the 43%-49% split between Biden and Trump.\n\nYet in a poll released July 11, which asked voter preferences if Vice President Kamala Harris were to replace Biden as the nominee, voter choices were 49-46%, Harris-Trump, among all adults and 49-47% among registered voters. Harris\u2019 49% was slightly better than Biden\u2019s 46%, although it wasn't a statistically significant lead over Trump.\n\nBiden defends campaign, explains performance\n\nPresident Joe Biden, in his first television interview following the debate against Trump, brushed off his poor performance.\n\n\"It was a bad episode,\" Biden told ABC News' George Stephanopoulos on July 5. \"No indication of any serious condition. I was exhausted. I didn't listen to my instincts in terms of preparing and -- and a bad night.\"\n\nBiden also said he was under the weather and \"feeling terrible.\"\n\n\"I asked if they did a COVID test because they're trying to figure out what was wrong. They did a test to see whether or not I had some infection, you know, a virus. I didn't. I just had a really bad cold,\" the president said.\n\nWhen Stephanopoulos asked: \"If you can be convinced that you cannot defeat Donald Trump, will you stand down?\"\n\nBiden responded: \"It depends on if the Lord Almighty comes down and tells me that, I might do that.\"\n\nIn a nearly hourlong solo press conference on July 11, Biden insisted that he's best situated to defeat former President Donald Trump this November, and said he was staying in the race despite his shaky debate performance.\n\nWhen asked if he would consider dropping out if his team showed data suggesting he could lose, he said: \"No, unless they came back and said, 'There\u2019s no way you can win' \u2026. No one is saying that. No poll says that.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden speaks from the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington, July 14, 2024. Susan Walsh/AP\n\nTrump's assassination attempt and the RNC\n\nFormer President Donald Trump was shot in the ear in an assassination attempt at an election rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13.\n\nFollowing the shooting, as well as the Republican National Convention the following week, former President Donald Trump's favorability rating among Americans rose, while a majority of Americans wanted President Joe Biden to drop out of the race, according to an ABC News/Ipsos poll.\n\nTrump's favorability rating increased to 40% following last week's events, marking his highest favorability rating in four years of ABC News/Ipsos polling. For most of the last four years, it has hovered in the low- to mid-30% range.\n\nIts high over the last nine years was 42% in August of 2020 according to an ABC News/Washington Post poll conducted then. At the same time, about half of Americans, 51%, currently view Trump unfavorably, according to this most recent poll.\n\nBiden campaign scrambles amid questions\n\nABC News reported that Biden's support from party leaders began to crumble as reports that former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, and other top politicians spoke with him and his campaign about the worsening reelection outlook.\n\nOn July 11, Biden's campaign began testing head-to-head matchups of Vice President Kamala Harris against former President Donald Trump, a source familiar with the strategy told ABC News.\n\nPelosi spoke with President Joe Biden around the same time, telling the president that she and other members of the Democratic Party were concerned about him staying in the race, a source confirmed to ABC News.\n\nSchumer also had a meeting with Biden earlier this month. A knowledgeable source close to both men told ABC News that Schumer made the case that it would be best if Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential race.\n\nHowever, on July 19, Biden said he would be returning to the campaign trail to continue to take on Trump following his COVID-19 diagnosis.\n\n\"I look forward to getting back on the campaign trail next week to continue exposing the threat of Donald Trump's Project 2025 agenda while making the case for my own record and the vision that I have for America: one where we save our democracy, protect our rights and freedoms, and create opportunity for everyone,\" Biden said in a statement.\n\nAccording to a new ABC News/Ipsos poll released on July 21, 60% of Democrats believe President Biden should drop out of the race for reelection.\n\nBiden drops out in historic move\n\nBiden said in a statement posted Sunday that he will \"stand down.\"\n\n\"It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President,\" he wrote, in part, in a letter posted on X. \"And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.\"\n\nIn another post on social media, Biden gave his \"full support and endorsement\" for Vice President Kamala Harris to be the Democratic Party's nominee.\n\nABC News' Tal Axelrod, Gary Langer, Ivan Pereira contributed to this report.",

Biden won about 95% of all delegates to the August 19\u201322 Democratic convention .",
        "text": "Can Kamala Harris win the US presidency after Joe Biden\u2019s withdrawal? Here\u2019s what the polls say\nThe United States election will be held on November 5. On Sunday US time, President Joe Biden withdrew from the presidential election contest and endorsed his vice president, Kamala Harris.\n\nIt\u2019s not certain, but very likely Harris will now be the Democratic candidate to face former Republican president Donald Trump in November. During the Democratic presidential primaries held early this year, Biden won about 95% of all delegates to the August 19\u201322 Democratic convention. These delegates are likely to support Harris given Biden\u2019s endorsement.\n\nSince the debate with Trump on June 27 that was widely thought to have been a disaster for Biden, he has faced pressure to withdraw. In an Ipsos poll for US ABC News that was released before Biden\u2019s withdrawal on Sunday, Democratic voters wanted Biden to withdraw by 60\u201339.\n\nFollowing the assassination attempt against Trump on July 13 and the Republican convention from July 15\u201318, Trump\u2019s lead over Biden in the FiveThirtyEight aggregate of national polls had increased to 3.2 points from 1.9 points on July 13, the largest margin since the aggregate began in March. Vote shares were 43.5% Trump, 40.2% Biden and 8.7% for Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nI\u2019ve written previously that the presidency is not decided by the national popular vote. Instead each state has a certain amount of Electoral Votes (EVs), mostly based on population, with each state awarding their EVs winner takes all. It takes 270 EVs to win. The EV system is likely to skew to Trump, so Biden was further behind than in the national polls.\n\nBiden will continue as president until his term ends in January 2025. His net approval in the FiveThirtyEight aggregate is -17.7, with 56.2% disapproving and 38.5% approving. His net approval is worse than other previous presidents at this point in their term, except George Bush Sr and Jimmy Carter.\n\nTrump\u2019s net favourability in the FiveThirtyEight aggregate is -12.0, with 53.7% unfavourable and 41.7% favourable. His ratings are relatively unchanged since April. Unfortunately, FiveThirtyEight has no favourability ratings for Harris.\n\nWill Harris win?\n\nIt\u2019s too soon to analyse Harris vs Trump polls. Harris had not been a presidential candidate before today and name recognition of Biden explains his often better numbers than Harris. A recent national YouGov poll for CBS News gave Trump a five-point lead over Biden and a three-point lead over Harris.\n\nThere are two things that should advantage Harris. One is that economic data has improved, with inflation dropping and real earnings up. The other is that, while Biden would have been almost 82 by the election, Harris will only be 60 by then. Trump is 78, so the age split that was unfavourable to Biden will be favourable to Harris.\n\nNevertheless, nominating a candidate who has not been battle-tested in the primaries is very risky. When Harris ran for president in 2020, she withdrew from the contest in December 2019, before any primaries.\n\nHowever, with Biden\u2019s age of great concern to voters, and with him already behind Trump, switching to a new candidate could prove a sensible move for the Democrats. Changes in prime minister have worked for Australian parties in the past, with Malcolm Turnbull winning the 2016 federal election after replacing Tony Abbott, and Scott Morrison winning in 2019 after replacing Turnbull.\n\nWhile Biden has been losing, US Senate polls in the presidential swing states of Pennsylvania, Nevada, Wisconsin, Michigan and Arizona suggest the Democratic candidates are winning, and doing much better than Biden. So perhaps Democrats just have a Biden problem.\n\nUS earnings up\n\nIn June, headline inflation dropped 0.1% after being unchanged in May and 12-month inflation dropped to 3.0%, the lowest it has been since June 2023. Core inflation was up 0.1% in June after increasing 0.2% in May and has increased 3.3% in the last 12 months, the smallest increase since April 2021.\n\nThe low inflation in May and June has boosted real (inflation-adjusted) earnings in those months, with real hourly earnings up 0.9% for May and June and real weekly earnings up 0.7%. In the 12 months to June, real hourly earnings are up 0.8% and real weekly earnings up 0.6%.\n\nIn June, a net 206,000 jobs were added, but the unemployment rate increased 0.1% to 4.1%. This is the highest unemployment rate since November 2021.",

        "text": "Biden drops out of 2024 presidential election, endorses Kamala Harris as Democratic nominee\nPresident Joe Biden on Sunday dropped out of the 2024 presidential race and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic Party's nominee, bowing to weeks of growing pressure by his own party members to quit his re-election bid against former President Donald Trump.\n\n\"It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President,\" Biden wrote in a post on the social media site X.\n\n\"And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term,\" Biden wrote.\n\n\"I will speak to the Nation later this week in more detail about my decision,\" wrote Biden, whose bombshell decision came after a sharp spike in recent days in the number of congressional Democrats publicly calling for him to step aside for another nominee.\n\nBiden in a subsequent tweet wrote that his \"very first decision as the party nominee in 2020 was to pick Kamala Harris as my Vice President.\"\n\n\"And it's been the best decision I've made. Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year. Democrats \u2014 it's time to come together and beat Trump,\" Biden wrote.\n\n\"Let's do this.\"\n\nHarris in a statement said, \"I am honored to have the President's endorsement and my intention is to earn and win this nomination.\"\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, in a joint statement from the Democratic power couple, said, \"We are honored to join the President in endorsing Vice President Harris and will do whatever we can to support her.\"\n\nBiden, who has been isolated at his Rehoboth, Delaware, beach home after being diagnosed with Covid-19, and Harris spoke on Sunday before he announced he would drop out of the election race.\n\nNBC News reported that Biden at 1:45 p.m. ET Sunday told his senior campaign team that he had changed his mind about remaining in the contest.\n\nOn Sunday evening, on a campaign staff call, Biden campaign co-chair Jen O'Malley Dillon called for staff to rally behind their new candidate and said that their jobs would safely transfer to the Harris campaign, three sources familiar with the call told NBC News.\n\nShe also acknowledged the emotional weight of the moment: \"It is ok to grieve, it is ok to be unsure but also be optimistic about our path forward.\"\n\nTrump in a phone interview with NBC News said of Biden's decision, \"He should never have been there in the first place.\"\n\n\"He should have stayed in his basement,\" said Trump, who was formally nominated as the Republican Party's candidate last week, days after narrowly avoiding being killed in an assassination attempt at a Pennsylvania campaign rally on July 13.\n\nDemocratic National Committee Jamie Harrison in a statement said, \"In the coming days, the Party will undertake a transparent and orderly process to move forward as a united Democratic Party with a candidate who can defeat Donald Trump in November.\"\n\n\"This process will be governed by established rules and procedures of the Party. Our delegates are prepared to take seriously their responsibility in swiftly delivering a candidate to the American people,\" Harrison said.",

        "text": "Joe Biden endorses Kamala Harris after he drops out of 2024 election: Recap\nEditor's note: This page reflects the news of Joe Biden stepping aside from his 2024 presidential campaign on Sunday, July 21. For the latest news on Kamala Harris' efforts to secure the Democratic nomination, follow our live election updates for Monday, July 22.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2212 President Joe Biden said Sunday he is ending his bid for reelection amid intense pressure from Democratic leaders sounding the alarm that his path to beat former President Donald Trump in November had vanished.\n\nThe president's historic withdrawal throws the 2024 race \u2212 already roiled by a shocking attempt on Trump's life \u2212 into uncertain territory, with Vice President Kamala Harris widely seen as the Democrat most likely to take Biden's place atop the party's ticket.\n\nBiden made the announcement from his home in Rehoboth Beach, Del., where he's self-isolated since testing positive for COVID-19 Thursday night.\n\nBiden quickly endorsed Harris as the Democratic nominee in a separate statement on X. Harris responded that she's honored to have Biden's endorsement, and her \"intention is to earn and win this nomination.\" The president and vice president spoke several times on Sunday morning ahead of his announcement.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nBiden said he would speak to the nation later this week to provide more details about his decision.\n\n\"It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President,\" Biden said in a letter addressed to Americans. \"And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and my country for me to stand down and to focus solely on my duties as President for the rest of my term.\"\n\nIn his statement, Biden reflected fondly on his four years in office, saying the U.S. has built the \u201cstrongest economy in the world\u201d while touting efforts to lower prescription drug prices, expand health care, tackle climate change and appointing the first Black woman to the Supreme Court, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson.\n\nThe decision upends the 2024 campaign 107 days before Election Day, with Democratic National Committee members now tasked with choosing an alternative nominee to take on Trump, whose polling lead has swelled while Democrats have fought internally.\n\nBiden's departure will soon mean the end of a five-decade career in Washington that began in 1972 with an upset victory for U.S. Senate in Delaware. He served as a senator for 36 years, then as Obama's vice president from 2009 to 2017. Biden returned to public life to run against Trump in the 2020 presidential election. He framed the race as a \"battle for the soul of the nation\" and defeated Trump 51%-47% in the popular vote.\n\nIt marks an extraordinary turn for Biden, who for three weeks remained defiant in the face of growing calls from Democratic lawmakers that he withdraw after a disastrous June 27 debate with Trump raised scrutiny over the president's mental fitness.\n\nKeep up with the USA TODAY Network's live updates.\n\nLouisiana Democratic delegation endorses Harris\n\nWhile President Biden's delegates at the upcoming Democratic National Convention are not formally obligated to follow his lead and back Vice President Kamala Harris as his replacement at the top of the ticket, the Louisiana delegation is already onboard.\n\n\"This evening, the LA delegation to the @DemConvention met virtually, and by an overwhelming majority vote, officially endorsed Vice President @KamalaHarris to be our 2024 Democratic Presidential Nominee,\" the state party reported on X.\n\n-Ben Adler\n\nCongressional Hispanic Caucus BOLD PAC endorses Harris\n\nIn a sign of coalescing Democratic Party unity around Harris, the campaign arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, BOLD PAC, announced Sunday night that it is endorsing President Biden's chosen successor.\n\nJust a few days ago, BOLD PAC stood squarely behind Biden amid growing calls for him to drop out.\n\n\"President Biden's tenure will be remembered for his accomplishments that stand among the best in history,\u201d said BOLD PAC Chair Rep. Linda Sa\u0301nchez, D-Calif., in the statement Sunday.\n\n\"As we look ahead, we know that these accomplishments would not have been possible without Vice President Kamala Harris and CHC BOLD PAC is proud to endorse her for president. This administration has led with working families in mind and shown an unwavering commitment to Latinos. There is so much work left to do and the stakes couldn\u2019t be higher. Make no mistake, Latinos nationwide will bear the brunt of the consequences of a Trump second presidency, just like they did in the past. BOLD PAC will remain laser focused on doing what it takes to ensure that Trump remains a one-term president. Vice President Harris is the leader we stand behind at this critical moment.\n\n-Ben Adler\n\nHow Harris would run against Trump\n\nA campaign ad from Harris' 2020 Democratic presidential primary campaign sheds light on how she might run against Trump if she becomes the Democratic nominee.\n\nThe ad, which was shared Sunday afternoon by a pro-Harris account on X, characterizes Harris as the antidote to Trump. It leans heavily on her work as a prosecutor and contrasts that record with Trump's alleged misdeeds.\n\n\"She prosecuted sex predators, he is one,\" the narrator notes, followed by the recording of Trump's crudely phrased statement that he grabs women by their genitals.\n\nThe ad goes on to draw similar comparisons. Whereas Harris prosecuted for-profit colleges that swindled students, Trump ran a for-profit university that was sued by former students who said they were misled by false claims. Trump agreed to a $25 million settlement\n\n-Ben Adler\n\nDemocrats raise nearly $50 million online since Biden\u2019s exit\n\nDemocrats have raised nearly $50 million online since President Joe Biden announced his decision on Sunday to drop out of the 2024 race and endorse Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee.\n\nActBlue, the leading site processing Democratic donations, said as of 9 p.m. ET it has raised $46.7 million from supporters, making Sunday its biggest fundraising day of the 2024 election cycle.\n\nMost of the Democratic Party has coalesced quickly around Harris as the nominee, making her the strong favorite to take on Trump in November.\n\n\u2212Joey Garrison\n\nJoe Manchin is considering seeking Democratic nomination\n\nSen Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., is considering switching his party affiliation from independent to Democratic to seek the party's presidential nomination after President Joe Biden announced Sunday that he will exit the 2024 race, according to Manchin's adviser Jonathan Kott.\n\nHe is the first Democrat to openly consider challenging Vice President Kamala Harris for the nomination. Manchin, 76, previously flirted with the idea of launching an independent campaign for the presidency, and at one point even floated appearing on a ballot with Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, but decided not to in mid-February.\n\nManchin is unlikely to receive much support from Democrats, given his record of bucking some of the party\u2019s major legislative proposals and his decision to register as an independent in May.\n\n-Karissa Waddick\n\nHarris makes the rounds\n\nVice President Kamala Harris spent her afternoon working the phones, calling Democratic Party leaders and members of Congress as she sought to quickly coalesce lawmakers and potential competitors around her candidacy. Among the Democratic officials she spoke to were Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a rising star in the party who leads a must-win battleground state, House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries and Congressional Black Caucus Chair Steven Horsford, according to a source familiar.\n\nHarris has plans to be in Milwaukee on Tuesday and Indianapolis on Wednesday at previously scheduled events. It was not immediately clear when she planned to hold her first campaign event after Biden's surprise dropout and endorsement on Sunday.\n\n-Francesca Chambers\n\nAOC endorses Harris for Democratic nomination\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., a key progressive Democrat, endorsed Harris for the Democratic nomination Sunday night as Harris continues to coalesces most of the Democratic Party around her bid.\n\n\u201cKamala Harris will be the next President of the United States. I pledge my full support to ensure her victory in November,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said in a statement on X.\n\n\u201cNow more than ever, it is crucial that our party and country swiftly unite to defeat Donald Trump and the threat to American democracy. Let\u2019s get to work.\u201d\n\nWhile 35 congressional Democrats publicly called for Biden to end his campaign prior to his announcement, Ocasio-Cortez was among those who remained behind the president.\n\n\u2212Joey Garrison\n\nTrump raises questions about the next debate\n\nIs Trump laying the groundwork to forgo a debate against Harris (or any other Democrat)?\n\nIn a Truth Social post late Sunday, Trump noted that his Sept. 10 debate with Biden \"was slated to be broadcast\" on ABC.\n\n\"Now that Joe has, not surprisingly, has quit the race, I think the Debate, with whomever the Radical Left Democrats choose, should be held on FoxNews, rather than very biased ABC.\"\n\nIn an interview with CBS News, Trump gave a somewhat equivocal answer to the debate question: \"I don\u2019t know who I'm going to debate. So far, we haven\u2019t determined who is going to be on that side. But I think whoever it is, I\u2019d like to debate. Yeah, sure.\"\n\n-David Jackson\n\nTennessee Democrats become first delegation to formally endorse Harris for president\n\nTennessee\u2019s 77 Democratic delegates voted by conference call Sunday afternoon to formally endorse Vice President Kamala Harris for the Democratic nomination, becoming the first delegates previously pledged to Biden in any state to formally back her.\n\nThe decision comes as much of the Democratic establishment, including former President Joe Biden, has quickly coalesced behind Harris following Biden\u2019s announcement to end his 2024 campaign.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very compelling to me that the president decided not to run and to endorse her,\u201d Chip Forrester, one of the Tennessee delegates, told USA TODAY. \u201cHe has worked with her for four years. He chose her as his running mate four years ago. For the president to have that kind of confidence is important to me.\u201d\n\nForrester said Harris also holds as strong \u201cstrategic position\u201d because she will inherit Biden\u2019s $240 million cash on hand that his campaign reported at the end of June.\n\nThe Harris campaign took over the Biden campaign committee following Biden\u2019s announcement to drop out.\n\n-- Joey Garrison and Melissa Brown\n\nPotential lawsuits to keep Biden as Democratic nominee would be fruitless: election experts\n\nRepublicans argued Democrats will be ignoring 14 million voters who supported President Joe Biden in the primaries after he declined to become the nominee, but election experts said Sunday that potential lawsuits aiming to keep Biden as the nominee would be fruitless.\n\n\u201cDemocrat party bosses just proved that they have absolutely no respect for their own voters,\u201dHouse Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., said in a statement. \u201cAfter lecturing others about democracy, they just forced Joe Biden off the ticket, trashing the primary choice of 14 million of their own voters.\u201d\n\nBut David Becker, a former Justice Department lawyer who enforced election laws and is now executive director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research, said potential lawsuits from Republicans or allies of former President Donald Trump couldn\u2019t force the Democratic Party to stick with Biden because parties choose their own nominees.\n\n\u201cThese claims are less than frivolous,\u201d Becker said. \u201cThat would not succeed and will not succeed in any state.\u201d\n\nBiden was not yet the Democratic nominee because the party has not yet held its convention scheduled for late August. The Supreme Court ruled unanimously in March that Colorado election officials couldn\u2019t keep Trump off the state\u2019s primary ballot because allowing states to set qualifications for federal office would lead to \u201cchaos.\u201d\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nMore:Who will be Kamala Harris' VP? Here's the possible contenders.\n\nJohn Kerry supports Kamala Harris as party\u2019s next nominee\n\nJohn Kerry, former Secretary of State under the Obama administration, in a statement on X, formerly Twitter, indicated he will join in on supporting Vice President Kamala Harris as the party\u2019s next nominee.\n\n\u201cPresident Biden deserves the gratitude of every American for his extraordinary presidency\u2026I know how difficult today\u2019s selfless decision must have been for someone who spent his entire life in service to country,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that \u201cnow is the time to listen to the only person who has ever beaten Donald Trump, and join with President Biden in every effort to make Vice President Harris the next President of the United States.\u201d\n\n-- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nElection expert says no way to hold more Democratic presidential primaries\n\nDavid Becker, a former Justice Department lawyer who enforced elections law and who now advises state and local officials who conduct elections, slammed the door Sunday on the potential for holding more presidential primaries before the Democratic National Convention in late August, calling it a \u201cfantasy.\u201d\n\nPresident Joe Biden was the presumptive Democratic nominee after winning state primaries. Some political analysts, such as GOP podcaster Mike Murphy, have suggested Vice President Kamala Harris would be a stronger nominee if she beat potential rivals in a new set of primaries.\n\n\u201cShe needs to become a winner, which means winning a nomination process,\u201d Murphy wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. \u201cThat would give her a lot more strength coming out of the convention.\u201d\n\nBut Becker, executive director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research, said states such as Arizona and Florida are still holding local primaries into September, so there is no way election officials could create a new set of primaries within days or weeks.\n\n\u201cThe idea that election officials who are already running elections could somehow put together a snap primary in days, and voters would know what to do and where to show up and to cast ballots for candidates we can\u2019t even imagine who might be running is fantasy. There is no feasible way to hold any kind of primaries right now,\u201d said Becker, who is also executive director of the Election Official Legal Defense Network. \u201cThere is no way to do open primaries.\u201d\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nLaPhonza Butler, only Black woman serving in U.S. Senate, backs Harris\n\nCalifornia\u2019s Laphonza Butler, the only Black woman serving in the U.S. Senate, applauded Biden\u2019s service and urged support for Harris. Butler was tapped to serve in the seat when Biden picked Harris for his running mate.\n\n\u201cThe threat to all that progress remains, and we must now do everything we can to ensure Vice President Harris succeeds,\u2019\u2019 Butler, the first woman of color to head EMILY's List, an organization that supports Democratic, pro-abortion rights women candidates, said in a statement. \u201cThere's no one better prepared for this challenge.\u2019\u2019\n\nHarris, the daughter of an Indian mother and Jamaican father, was the second Black woman to serve in the U.S. Senate. Others vying to make similar history praised Harris\u2019 bid for president.\n\nAngela Alsobrooks, a Democrat and a Black woman running for the U.S. Senate in Maryland, said she is 100% behind Harris.\n\n\u201cShe will provide a clear and stark contrast to the regressive vision Donald Trump has for this country,\u2019\u2019 she said in a statement. \u201cShe will make this race about the future and the kind of country our children deserve to inherit.\u201d\n\n-- Deborah Barfield Berry\n\nHarris takes over Biden campaign committee\n\nThe former Biden campaign is now officially the Harris for President campaign.\n\nThe campaign formerly known as Biden for President in a filing Sunday afternoon with the Federal Election Commission changed its name to the Harris for President campaign.\n\nThe move makes Harris\u2019 bid for the Democratic nomination official, with her campaign apparently assuming control of Biden\u2019s campaign funds. The move also allows Harris to begin raising money for her presidential bid. Harris named Keana Spencer her treasurer.\n\n-- Joey Garrison\n\nEmily\u2019s List endorses Kamala Harris for president\n\nEmily\u2019s List, an organization that supports Democratic, pro-abortion rights women candidates, endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris in a post on X, formerly Twitter.\n\n\u201c.@kamalaharris was made for this moment,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThroughout her career, she has been a steadfast fighter for women and reproductive freedom \u2014 a role that is more important than ever before. We\u2019re proud to endorse her for president.\u201d\n\n-- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nRep. Cori Bush endorses Kamala Harris for president\n\nBush is currently in a tight primary race and said this month that her constituents had concerns about President Joe Biden\u2019s viability as a candidate. She praised him for \u201cprioritizing our nation\u2019s needs\u201d and threw her support behind Harris.\n\n\u201cWhen we say trust Black women, we mean it. Black women are the backbone of the Democratic Party and it is past time for us to lead at this moment,\u201d Bush said.\n\n\u2014 Rachel Barber\n\n'There are many questions now'\n\nShannon O'Brien, a presidential history professor at the University of Texas, called Biden's announcement \"huge:\" \"We've never had a candidate drop out willingly so late before.\"\n\nThe professor also explained how the Democratic convention could potentially function next month.\n\n\"There are many questions now. The pledged delegates for each state are bound by state rules to vote for their candidate X number of times under state law,\" O'Brien explained. \"If Biden has enough to win, then he can decline, which will throw it immediately into a brokered convention. I don't know what it means with Harris on the ticket and much of this would come down to state law on whether or not she wins those pledged delegates.\"\n\n\u2212 Darren Samuelsohn\n\nNational Ice Cream Day: A fitting day for Biden\n\nIt\u2019s no secret: Joe Biden loves ice cream. There are so many photos of the president enjoying the classic summer dessert.\n\nThe president's connection to the delightful treat continued Sunday. Biden happened to announce his decision to drop out of the 2024 presidential race on National Ice Cream Day, July 20.\n\nThen again, according to Biden, everyday is National Ice Cream Day.\n\n\u2013 Karissa Waddick\n\nDemocratic lawmaker calls on Trump to step down too\n\nRep. Dan Goldman, D-N.Y., in a statement said Biden \u201cmade the difficult but selfless decision to pass the torch to the next generation of leaders in the Democratic Party to ensure that our democracy remains strong and true.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe American people have made it clear that they want a new generation of leaders to run for President,\u201d he said.\n\nGoldman urged Trump to follow Biden\u2019s footsteps.\n\n\u201cI urge Donald Trump to follow President Biden\u2019s lead and put the country first by passing his party\u2019s baton to a younger and healthier candidate who is not a convicted felon,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2212 Sudiksha Kochi\n\nNC Gov. Cooper does not weigh in on VP chatter\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper could be among those being considered to join the Democratic presidential ticket as Kamala Harris' vice president, if she is chosen to replace Joe Biden as the party's nominee. But Cooper didn't address those rumors in a brief statement posted to social media Sunday about Biden's departure from the race.\n\n\"I'm deeply grateful to call President Joe Biden my friend, and I thank him from the bottom of my heart for his service to our great nation,\" Cooper said in a post on X, which mainly focused on Biden's achievements as president.\n\n\u2013 Karissa Waddick\n\nCalifornia senator endorses Harris for president\n\nSen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., from Kamala Harris\u2019 home state, endorsed her for president Sunday.\n\nPadilla replaced Harris in Congress when she was tapped to join Joe Biden on the 2020 Democratic ticket.\n\n\u201cFrom California to the White House, Vice President Harris has always led with courage and conviction,\u201d Padilla wrote in a post on X, \u201cI\u2019m proud to endorse @KamalaHarris to unify our party and defeat Donald Trump.\u201d\n\n\u2212Rachel Barber\n\nRep. Clyburn, credited for helping Biden win the 2020 primary, has endorsed Harris for president\n\nSouth Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn, a long serving House leader who helped Biden secure the nomination in 2020, said in a statement he endorses Vice President Kamala Harris' bid to become the nominee now that Biden has dropped out.\n\n\u201cOne of President Biden\u2019s first decisions as the nominee was to select a running mate that he believed possessed the values and vision necessary to continue this country\u2019s pursuit toward a \u2018more perfect union,\u2019\" Clyburn said. \"I echo the good judgement he demonstrated in selecting Vice President Harris to lead this nation alongside him, and I am proud to follow his lead in support of her candidacy to succeed him as the Democratic Party\u2019s 2024 nominee for president.\u201d\n\n\u2212Sarah D. Wire\n\nWhen is Biden's address to the nation after dropping out of 2024 race?\n\nAccording to Joe Biden's Sunday announcement, Americans can expect to hear more from the president in the coming days.\n\n\"I will speak to the nation later this week in more to detail about my decision,\" the president wrote.\n\nHe did not give an exact date or time.\n\n\u2212 Natalie Neysa Alund\n\nWhen is the DNC? Here's what to know about 2024 convention after Biden drops out of race\n\nOn the heels of Joe Biden's decision to end his bid for reelection amid intense pressure from scores of his own party leaders, all eyes are now on Chicago where the Democratic National Convention is set to kick off next month.\n\nThe DNC is slated to take place August 19 through August 22.\n\n\u2212 Natalie Neysa Alund\n\nJD Vance slams Biden and Harris\n\nFormer President Donald Trump\u2019s running mate J.D. Vance criticized Joe Biden and Kamala Harris\u2019 tenure in office in statement Sunday.\n\nThe Ohio senator, 39, called Biden the \u201cworst\u201d president of his lifetime and said Harris \u201chas been right there with him every step of the way.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Trump and I are ready to save America, whoever's at the top of the Democrat ticket. Bring it on,\" Vance said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.\n\n\u2212Rachel Barber\n\nSen. Coons, one of Biden's closest allies, backs Harris for Democratic nomination\n\nSen. Chris Coons, D-Del., and national co-chair of Biden\u2019s election campaign, told CNN Sunday that he supports Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic Party\u2019s next nominee.\n\n\u201cI support Vice President Harris. I am very hopeful that we will come out of our convention next month united and that everyone who has expressed concerns and hopes and thoughts and fears in the last few months, we'll continue to support the ticket that will win this fall,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd we'll see what happens in terms of the choice for a running mate. But I think our President Joe Biden has made his endorsement clear. And I think that is the most important endorsement that we could all be paying attention to today.\u201d\n\nHe said earlier in the interview that Harris \u201chas fought hard for freedoms and for rights of Americans and she is a genuine leader.\u201d\n\n\u2212 Sudiksha Kochi\n\nIllinois Gov. Pritzker praises Biden, jabs Trump in statement\n\nIllinois Gov. JB Pritzker, another Democrat who could be vetted to join the Democratic presidential ticket now that Joe Biden has dropped out, praised the former president Sunday before focusing on Donald Trump.\n\nIn a post on X Pritzker commended Biden for working across the aisle to pass infrastructure legislation and shepherd the country past the COVID-19 pandemic. He then criticized Trump for his 34 felony convictions and stances on issues like abortion.\n\n\u201cAs we extend our gratitude toward President Biden and reflect on his many accomplishments, we must not ignore the threat posed by Donald Trump\u2019s potential return to the White House,\u201d Pritzker said. \u201cI will work everyday to ensure that he does not win in November.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Karissa Waddick\n\nThe 'ultimate statesman'\n\nThe Congressional Black Caucus PAC in a statement called Biden the \u201cultimate statesman\u201d in a statement on X, formerly Twitter.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s dedicated his entire career, amid great personal sacrifice, in service to the values of democracy; civility, freedom and opportunity\u2026 Americans and democracy loving people around the world owe Joe Biden a great debt of gratitude,\u201d the statement says.\n\nThe group added that it joins Biden in \u201csupporting Kamala Harris as our party\u2019s nominee.\u201d\n\n\u2212 Sudiksha Kochi\n\nBiden among most significant US presidents, Pete Buttigieg says\n\nTransportation Secretary and former Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg on Sunday lauded Joe Biden as one of the \"most consequential presidents in American history,\" after the president announced he would not seek another term.\n\nButtigieg has popped up as a potential vice presidential running mate for Kamala Harris, who is the frontrunner to replace Biden as the 2024 Democratic presidential nominee. But the former South Bend, Indiana mayor did not address those rumors in his brief social media statement that focused on Biden's presidency.\n\n\"I am so proud to serve under his leadership, and thankful for his unwavering focus on what is best for our country,\" Buttigieg said.\n\n\u2013 Karissa Waddick\n\nKamala Harris thanks Biden for service, says she will seek nomination\n\nKamala Harris said in a statement that she is \u201cdeeply grateful\u201d to Joe Biden and his family: \u201cWith this selfless and patriotic act, President Biden is doing what he has done throughout his life of service: putting the American people and our country above everything else.\n\nShe said she is honored to have his endorsement.\n\n\"My intention is to earn and win this nomination. Over the past year, I have traveled across the country, talking with Americans about the clear choice in this momentous election. And that is what I will continue to do in the days and weeks ahead. I will do everything in my power to unite the Democratic Party\u2014and unite our nation\u2014to defeat Donald Trump and his extreme Project 2025 agenda,\u201d she said.\n\n\u2212 Sarah D. Wire\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. says he commends Biden for stepping down\n\nIndependent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said in a statement on X, formerly Twitter, that he commends President Joe Biden for stepping out of the 2024 race.\n\n\u201cHis infirmities were evident to any unbiased observer from the beginning. It was this progressive deterioration \u2014 and his abandonment of Democratic Party principles \u2014 that prompted me to enter the race and ensure American voters had a viable, vigorous alternative to Donald Trump,\u201d said Kennedy.\n\nHe also called on the Democratic Party to \u201creturn to its traditional commitment to democracy and exemplify it with an open process.\u201d\n\n\u201cInstead of anointing a candidate hand-picked by DNC elites, the party should use neutral polling to identify the candidate who can best beat Donald Trump. The delegates should then select a nominee based on this information,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they had done this to begin with, I would not have had to leave the Democratic Party.\u201d\n\n\u2212Sudiksha Kochi\n\nYoung voter group endorses Harris for president\n\nVoters of Tomorrow, a political advocacy group representing Gen Z, endorsed Kamala Harris for president in a statement Sunday.\n\nThe organization has chapters in 20 states and a volunteer presence across the country. It had previously endorsed Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cAs vice president, Kamala Harris has been one of Gen Z\u2019s fiercest champions,\u201d the statement said. \u201cHarris has presented a clear vision for our future \u2014 a vision that will undoubtedly fire up young people this election to defeat Donald Trump.\u201d\n\n\u2212 Rachel Barber\n\nObama: Biden is \u2018a patriot of the highest order\u2019\n\nFormer President Barack Obama praised Biden\u2019s decision to end his campaign for a second term, saying he selflessly put the country\u2019s interests ahead of his own.\n\nBiden\u2019s \u201coutstanding track record\u201d while in office gave him \u201cevery right to run for re-election and finish the job he started,\u201d Obama said. But, \u201cJoe understands better than anyone the stakes in this election \u2014 how everything he has fought for throughout his life, and everything that the Democratic Party stands for, will be at risk if we allow Donald Trump back in the White House and give Republicans control of Congress.\u201d\n\nBiden, who served as vice president during the eight years of Obama\u2019s presidency, has never backed down from a fight, Obama said.\n\n\u201cFor him to look at the political landscape and decide that he should pass the torch to a new nominee is surely one of the toughest in his life,\u201d the former president said. \u201cBut I know he wouldn\u2019t make this decision unless he believed it was right for America. It\u2019s a testament to Joe Biden\u2019s love of country \u2014 and a historic example of a genuine public servant once again putting the interests of the American people ahead of his own that future generations of leaders will do well to follow.\u201d\n\nBiden has been \u201cone of America\u2019s most consequential presidents,\u201d Obama said, and \u201ca patriot of the highest order.\n\nObama\u2019s statement made no mention of Vice President Kamala Harris, who is considered the frontrunner to replace Biden on the ticket.\n\n\u2013 Michael Collins\n\nBiden adviser Klain bemoans \u2018donors and electeds\u2019 who pushed the president\n\nJoe Biden\u2019s former White House chief of staff Ron Klain called on Democrats to unite behind Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee \u2013 and took at shot at Biden\u2019s Democratic detractors in doing so.\n\n\u201cNow that the donors and electeds have pushed out the only candidate who has ever beaten Trump, it\u2019s time to end the political fantasy games and unite behind the only veteran of a national campaign \u2014 our outstanding VP, Kamala Harris! Let\u2019s get real and win in November!\u201d Klain wrote in a post on X.\n\nKlain, a longtime Biden aide and among the president closest advisors, had been serving as a campaign adviser for Biden.\n\n\u2212Joey Garrison\n\nPresident of conservative think tank linked to Project 2025 calls for Biden to resign\n\nKevin Roberts, president of the right-wing think tank The Heritage Foundation that's linked to Project 2025, joined calls for Joe Biden to resign the presidency. Project 2025 is a 900-page, sweeping conservative plan for the next GOP administration.\n\n\u201cIf President Biden is incapable of running a presidential race, how can he lead our nation for another six months?\u201d Roberts said in a statement Sunday. \u201cIn the interest of national security and the safety of our citizens, President Biden must immediately resign.\u201d\n\n\u2212Rachel Barber\n\nWhitmer says her job 'remains the same' after Biden drops out\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said Sunday that her role in the 2024 election is unchanged in light of Joe Biden\u2019s decision to leave the race, though she didn't explicitly say she wouldn't seek the Democratic nomination.\n\nWhitmer\u2019s name has risen to the top of the list of potential vice presidential nominees who could join a new Democratic ticket led by Kamala Harris.\n\nHowever, the Michigan governor said in a social media post, that her \u201cjob in this election will remain the same: doing everything I can to elect Democrats and stop Donald Trump, a convicted felon whose agenda of raising families\u2019 costs, banning abortion nationwide, and abusing the power of the White House to settle his own scores is completely wrong for Michigan.\u201d\n\n\u2212Karissa Waddick\n\nSanders praises Biden\u2019s tenure in office\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., thanked Joe Biden for serving the country with \u201chonor and dignity\u201d after the president announced he would end his reelection campaign.\n\nWhile the list of Democrats calling for Biden to exit the 2024 race grew, Sanders continued to back the president until he dropped out Sunday.\n\n\u201cAs the first president to ever walk on a picket line with striking workers, he has been the most pro-working class president in modern American history,\u201d Sanders wrote in a social media post. \u201cThank you, Mr. President, for all you\u2019ve done.\u201d\n\n\u2212Rachel Barber\n\nBill and Hillary Clinton endorse VP Harris for president\n\nBill and Hillary Clinton have endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to become the Democratic nominee for president.\n\nThe former president and the former secretary of state, who was the Democratic nominee for president in 2016, pledged to do \u201cwhatever we can\u201d to support Harris.\u201cWe\u2019ve lived through many ups and downs, but nothing has made us more worried for our country than the threat posed by a second Trump term,\u201d the Clintons said in a joint statement. \u201cHe has promised to be a dictator on day one, and the recent ruling by his servile Supreme Court will only embolden him to further shred the Constitution. Now is the time to support Kamala Harris and fight with everything we\u2019ve got to elect her. America\u2019s future depends on it.\u201d\n\nThe Clintons also offered praise for Biden, saying he lifted the country out of an unprecedented pandemic, created millions of new jobs, rebuilt a battered economy, strengthened democracy and restored America\u2019s standing in the world.\n\n\u2013Michael Collins\n\nWho will replace Biden? Harris is the immediate frontrunner\n\nKamala Harris appears to be the leading candidate to replace Joe Biden as the Democratic Party\u2019s nominee in the 2024 election, after the president dropped his reelection bid amid rising concerns about his age following his debate with former President Donald Trump.\n\nBiden emphatically endorsed Harris to be the Democratic presidential nominee in a social media post Sunday shortly after announcing his decision to step out of the 2024 race.\n\nIf formally nominated, Harris, 59, would become the first Black woman at the top of a major party presidential ticket. She has served as Biden\u2019s vice president for more than three years and before that represented California in the U.S. Senate.\n\n\u2212 Karissa Waddick\n\nRead Biden's full statement as he drops out of 2024 presidential race\n\nJoe Biden announced that he's dropping out of the 2024 race in a reflective letter penned to his fellow Americans. You can read the full message here.\n\n\u2212 James Powel\n\nMike Johnson calls on Biden to resign presidency\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., called on Biden to resign as president following his decision not to seek a second term.\n\n\u201cIf Joe Biden is not fit to run for president, he is not fit to serve as president,\u201d Johnson said in a statement. \u201cHe must resign the office immediately. Nov. 5 cannot arrive soon enough.\u201d\n\nJohnson said Biden\u2019s decision to leave the race under pressure from Democrats who feared he would lose to Trump \u201cinvalidated the votes of more than 14 million Americans who selected Joe Biden to be the Democrat nominee for president.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe party\u2019s prospects are no better now with Vice President Kamala Harris, who co-owns the disastrous policy failures of the Biden administration,\u201d he said. \u201cAs second in command and a completely inept border czar, Harris has been a gleeful accomplice \u2014 not only in the destruction of American sovereignty, security, and prosperity, but also in the largest political coverup in U.S. history. She has known for as long as anyone of his incapacity to serve.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Michael Collins\n\nPelosi calls Biden 'one of the most consequential Presidents in American history'\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, in a statement on Biden\u2019s decision to withdraw from the race, said Biden is a \u201cpatriotic American who has always put his nation first.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis legacy of vision, values and leadership make him one of the most consequential Presidents in American history,\u201d Pelosi said.\n\nThe former House speaker added: \u201cWith love and gratitude to President Biden for always believing in the promise of America and giving people the opportunity to reach their fulfillment. God blessed America with Joe Biden\u2019s greatness and goodness.\u201d\n\nIn recent days, Pelosi had reportedly shared concerns privately to Biden about his grim prospects to defeat Trump and that his candidacy could doom Senate and House Democratic candidates.\n\n\u2212 Joey Garrison\n\nPotential VP nominee Beshear says Biden's decision in \u201cbest interest\u201d of country\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear called Joe Biden\u2019s decision to drop his 2024 reelection bid in the \u201cbest interest of the country and party,\u201d in a statement Sunday.\n\n\u201cPresident Biden will be remembered as a consequential president. Along with Vice President Harris, he led us through the aftermath of the January 6th attack on our Capitol and steadily steered us out of a global pandemic,\u201d Beshear wrote.\n\nHe is among a handful of Democratic governors believed to be on the short list to now join the Democratic presidential ticket.\n\n\u201cNow it\u2019s time for our nation to come together,\u201d Beshear added in the post. \u201cWe need to dial down the anger, rancor and noise.\"\n\n\u2212Karissa Waddick\n\nHakeem Jeffries: 'We are forever grateful'\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., issued a statement that praised Biden's accomplishments as president but did not address whether Harris should be the nominee. \"America is a better place today because President Joe Biden has led us with intellect, grace and dignity. We are forever grateful,\" he said.\n\n\u2212 Kathryn Palmer\n\nDNC chair says Democrats will launch process of choosing new candidate\n\nDemocratic National Committee chairman Jaime Harrison said in the coming days Democrats will \u201cundertake a transparent and orderly process to move forward as a united Democratic Party with a candidate who can defeat Donald Trump in November.\u201d\n\nHarrison said the process will be \u201cgoverned by established rules and procedures of the Party.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur delegates are prepared to take seriously their responsibility in swiftly delivering a candidate to the American people,\u201d Harrison said, adding that the American people will hear \u201cin short order\u201d from the Democratic Party on the next steps in the nomination process.\n\nThe DNC convention is set for Aug. 19 to 22 in Chicago, but Democratic National Committee leaders have planned for a virtual roll-call vote before Aug. 7 to satisfy concerns with ballot deadlines in several states.\n\n\u2212 Joey Garrison\n\nJosh Shapiro calls Biden a 'patriot'\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro hailed Joe Biden as a \u201cpatriot\u201d and commended his work as president in a social media post on Sunday shortly after the president announced he was dropping out of the 2024 race.\u201cPresident Biden has gotten an incredible amount done to move our country forward, defend our democracy, and protect real freedom,\u201d Shapiro wrote on X, formerly Twitter.Shapiro has been floated as a potential Democratic presidential nominee to replace Biden, or as a vice presidential nominee if Kamala Harris takes over the top of the ticket. Shapiro did not mention Harris in his message Sunday.\u201cI am proud to work by his side and am grateful for his leadership and his unwavering commitment to delivering for Pennsylvania \u2014 the Commonwealth that raised him,\u201d Shapiro said about Biden in the post.\n\n\u2212Karissa Waddick\n\nSchumer says Biden put 'his country, his party, and our future first'\n\nChuck Schumer shared in a post on X that \"Joe Biden has not only been a great president and a great legislative leader but he's a truly amazing human being.\"\n\n\"His decision of course was not easy, but he once again put his country, his party, and our future first. Joe, today shows you are a true patriot and great American,\" he added.\n\n\u2212Marina Pitofsky\n\nBiden exits race amid widespread pressure, mounting concerns about his age\n\nBiden's exit came after he received bleak warnings from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Democratic House Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., that his candidacy could lead to massive losses for Democrats in the Senate and House. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi shared similar concerns to Biden.\n\nMore than 30 congressional Democrats had called for Biden to bow out. Former President Barack Obama reportedly also relayed fears privately to Democratic allies about Biden's prospects of beating Trump. Democratic donors from Hollywood to Wall Street also came out against Biden continuing his reelection bid.\n\nBiden, 81, has battled Americans\u2019 concerns over his age since he took office but it turned into panic for Democrats after last month's first debate with Trump, the Republican nominee. Biden's voice sounded faint, he struggled to complete sentences and finish thoughts, and he failed to rebut many of Trump's claims on the debate stage.\n\nBiden's campaign was in a free fall over the past few weeks with his future in doubt. Instead of focusing solely on Trump, Democrats spent as much time and energy debating whether Biden could even defeat his predecessor.\n\nFundraising for the Biden campaign took a dramatic hit. And Biden not only fell behind in key battleground states that will decide the election, but his growing unpopularity seemed to put recent Democratic strongholds like Virginia in play for Trump.\n\n\u2212Joey Garrison and Swapna Venugopal\n\nBiden becomes first incumbent not to seek reelection since LBJ\n\nBiden becomes the first incumbent president not to seek reelection since Lyndon B. Johnson who, in 1968 amid national unrest and turmoil within the Democratic Party over the Vietnam War, stunned the nation with his decision not to seek a second full term.\n\n\u2212 Joey Garrison\n\nWho could replace Biden?\n\nWith Biden's endorsement, Harris is the clear frontrunner to replace Biden as the Democratic nominee, but the party's bench of Democratic governors could also be in the mix including Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania and Gavin Newsom of California.\n\n\u2212 Joey Garrison\n\nTrump knocks Biden after exit\n\nDonald Trump, in a post on his social media web site Truth Social after Biden\u2019s exit, wrote: \"Crooked Joe Biden was not fit to run for President, and is certainly not fit to serve - And never was!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will suffer greatly because of his presidency, but we will remedy the damage he has done very quickly,\u201d Trump added.\n\n\u2212Joey Garrison\n\nJill Biden reacts to Joe Biden dropping out of 2024 race\n\nFirst lady Jill Biden on Sunday reposted the president's message with heart emojis. She also retweeted her husband's message endorsing Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.\n\n\u2212 Marina Pitofsky",

        "text": "Trump vs. Harris: What Each Administration Would Mean for the Travel Industry\nPresident Joe Biden\u2019s decision to leave the 2024 U.S. presidential race put an unprecedented twist on what was always going to be an unconventional election. But one thing is clear: Each potential administration\u2019s policies will be wildly different \u2013 and have significant implications on the global travel industry.\n\nThe article discusses the potential impacts of the 2024 presidential election on the travel industry, focusing on the differences between a Trump-Vance and a Harris administration. A second Trump administration could mean a rollback of environmental regulations, visa delays, a revival of travel bans, and a mixed approach to airline mergers. On the other hand, a Harris administration might continue the Biden administration's hardline stance on mergers, improve visa processing times, maintain moderate immigration policies, and focus on climate change and international relations.\n\nWith the 2024 Republican presidential ticket of Donald Trump and J.D. Vance solidified last week in Milwaukee, Democrats have a lot of work to do before their convention in less than a month \u2013 now without an official candidate or a vice presidential nominee.\n\nOn Sunday, just after announcing he would be stepping out of the race, President Biden endorsed his vice president, Kamala Harris, for the role. This comes only days after the former president Trump was shot at a campaign rally, surviving the assassination attempt with only minor injuries. Days later he selected populist icon, Ohio senator J.D. Vance, as his running mate.\n\nFor the travel industry, whichever of the two tickets prevails in November will mean a wildly different landscape for the next four years.\n\nBut we\u2019ve seen a Trump presidency before. And we can look to the last four years of Biden-Harris for hints of what she might do if she\u2019s ultimately both a) the candidate and b) elected in November.\n\nA Second Trump Administration\n\nReading the tea leaves from the former president\u2019s policies on visas, regulation, the environment and more, we could see some of the following actions impacting the travel industry if the former president is elected a second time.\n\n\n\nThe DOT\u2019s New Junk Fee Disclosure Rule Could Be At Risk: The new junk fee disclosure rule is set to take effect in October and requires airlines to disclose all fees associated with buying a ticket. Major airlines have already sued to block it.\n\nThe text of the rule in the Federal Register notes that a 2017 executive order from the Trump administration undid a similar rule before it could take effect.\n\nProject 2025, a series of conservative policy proposals that Trump has not publicly endorsed, refers to \u201cburdensome disclosure mandates\u201d in the chapter on the Department of Transportation. \u201cThe Trump Administration reformed the process for issuing such \u2018unfair and deceptive practices\u2019 rules, but the Biden Administration promptly reversed those reforms. A new Administration should restore them.\u201d\n\nVisa Delays: It might take longer to get a visa. During the first Trump Administration there was a hiring freeze of visa processing staff at the State Department. This, coupled with high pent-up demand, reduced staff during the pandemic, boosted vetting procedures and caused delays and denials in visa issuance for many applicants, particularly those from countries flagged for higher security concerns\u200b\u200b.\n\nA Revival of Travel Bans: The administration\u2019s travel bans could be reinstated or expanded under his next administration. In January 2017, the Trump administration issued Executive Order 13769 and restricted entry to the United States for citizens from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. The Biden-Harris administration revoked these bans.\n\nAn Inconsistent Merger Atmosphere. A second Trump administration could be more friendly to airlines looking for consolidation, but there\u2019s also a chance it could have a more populist approach. During Trump\u2019s first term, his administration held an \u201cinconsistent\u201d stance on mergers, according to a law journal that specializes in antitrust issues \u2013 the Trump administration controversially approved the Northeast Alliance between American Airlines and JetBlue. Yet it sought to block high profile mergers, such as AT&T-Time Warner.\n\nDoubling Down on an \u201cAmerica First\u201d Approach: The former president continues to campaign on his Make America Great Again platform. This stance was not popular with many of America\u2019s historic allies and could result in reduced international cooperation and potentially strained relationships with some countries, affecting global travel patterns and international tourism.\n\nGreater Infrastructure Investments: The former president likes infrastructure. He famously called La Guardia airport \u2013 which has since been beautifully transformed \u2013 \u201cthird world\u201d during a 2016 debate with Hillary Clinton. He also proposed an ultimately unsuccessful $1.5 trillion infrastructure plan aimed to invest in various projects over 10 years. That plan faced significant challenges in Congress and ended with no major bill being passed\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b. In a second administration, he could likely try again \u2013 especially if he has a friendlier congress.\n\nFewer Environmental Rules: Prepare for less environmental regulation. The Trump administration relaxed climate rules during its initial term. This included weakening standards on air and water quality, reducing restrictions on fossil fuel production, and changing rules that had been designed to limit pollution from power plants and vehicles. He also withdrew the United States from the Paris Climate Accord on June 1, 2017, arguing that the agreement was unfair to the U.S. and would undermine the nation\u2019s economy.\n\nA Possible Hardline on USA\u2019s DMO: During the first Trump administration, it tried to eliminate funding for Brand USA, America\u2019s national destination marketing organization. In a 2018 budget proposal, the administration proposed cutting the government\u2019s annual funding to Brand USA and putting it toward the Department of Homeland Security. Ultimately, however, the Brand USA Extension Act reauthorized the DMO through 2027.\n\nA New Harris Administration\n\nIn the event Vice President Kamala Harris becomes the the democratic nominee for president and she is able to beat Donald Trump at the polls in November, here\u2019s what it might mean for the travel sector.\n\nA Continued Hard Line on Mergers. The Biden administration has been hawkish on antitrust enforcement, successfully suing to block the JetBlue-Spirit merger \u2014 the first airline merger blocked in the past two decades. It also undid the Northeast Alliance. Now, the Biden administration is expected to release a decision on the Alaska-Hawaiian merger in the coming months.\n\nProgress on Visa Wait Times: For much of 2022 and 2023, visa wait times remained stuck at over 400 days on average for first-time travelers in some top inbound markets, a hangover from the pandemic.\n\nThe State Department has implemented a series of changes like waiving interviews for select applicants, moving staff to countries with large backlogs, and hiring staff back to pre-pandemic levels. In December 2023, the State Department extended its visa interview waiver authority for visa applicants indefinitely.\n\nAs of June 2024, according to U.S. Travel, U.S. visa wait times for major non-exempt source countries remain elevated, but have dropped to 300 days.\n\nSome embassies, like in India, have seen major improvements, with a record number of visas issued. President Biden told Eric Garcetti, U.S. Ambassador to India, to tackle the visa delays, the ambassador said at the Skift India Summit.\n\nMore Passport Processing: Like with visas, the State Department has reduced processing times, from an 18-week high in 2021 to between 6 and 8 weeks in December 2023. A record 24 million passports were issued in the 2023 fiscal year. The State Department plans to establish half a dozen new passport agencies, bringing its network to 35.\n\nModerate Immigration Policy: Harris would likely adopt a more moderate stance on immigration than a Trump administration, potentially easing visa processes and encouraging more international visitors to the U.S. The Biden-Harris administration also revoked the Trump administration\u2019s travel ban.\n\nA Continued Investment in International Relations: Harris\u2019s global stance would likely mirror the Biden administration\u2019s foreign policy objectives \u2013 including its commitment to alliances such as NATO. Her experience as vice president in meeting world leaders could foster improved diplomatic ties, potentially leading to increased bilateral tourism agreements and easier travel between countries.\n\nA Focus On the Climate Crisis: The travel industry can expect a continued focus on climate change from Harris. In 2021, the Biden-Harris administration re-entered the Paris Climate Accord after the Trump administration pulled out of the agreement in 2017. That re-committed the U.S. to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and working with other nations to combat global warming\u200b\u200b.\n\nAirlines\u2019 Automatic Refunds: In addition to the new junk fee disclosure rule, the Department of Transportation in the Biden-Harris administration passed a requirement that airlines provide automatic cash refunds in instances where flights are significantly delayed or canceled, checked baggage is delayed or when ancillary services that were paid for are not provided. It\u2019s due to take effect in October.\n\nSkift will be closely following all developments and reporting on how the 2024 election could impact the travel sector.",

        "text": "What is an open convention?\nFollowing President Joe Biden\u2019s withdrawal from the presidential race, the Democratic Party\u2019s focus has turned to its nominating convention, which will likely be the first open Democratic convention in decades.\n\nHere is a look at how open conventions work, how the party chooses its nominee and what types of candidates are successful.\n\nWhat is an open convention?\n\nAn \u201copen\u201d convention happens when there is no predetermined nominee at the start of a convention. At this year\u2019s Democratic National Convention, delegates who were once bound to nominate Biden can cast their votes for any new candidate.\n\nWhat are contested or brokered conventions?\n\n\u201cContested\u201d or \u201cbrokered\u201d conventions are types of open conventions. While there is no official definition, most experts agree that a contested convention is one in which no candidate has secured a majority of delegates before the convention\u2019s start. It can turn into a \u201cbrokered\u201d or \u201cmulti-balloted\u201d convention if no candidate wins the nomination on the first ballot.\n\nWhen was the last multi-balloted convention?\n\nThe last conventions to fail to nominate a candidate on the first ballot were in 1952, with both Democrats and Republicans needing multiple ballots to nominate Adlai Stevenson and Dwight Eisenhower, respectively. Eisenhower won the general election.\n\nWhen was the last contested convention?\n\nThe last time there was serious doubt about who a convention would nominate was in 1976, when Republican candidates Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan both amassed a significant number of delegates in the primary elections, but neither won enough to secure the nomination outright. Ford went on to win the Republican nomination on the first ballot but would lose the general election to Democrat Jimmy Carter.\n\nAre open conventions rare?\n\nWhile open conventions in the modern era are relatively rare, they were the way political parties chose their presidential nominees throughout much of America\u2019s history. \u201cBrokered\u201d conventions are called that because they often resulted from party leaders brokering the winner in backroom deals.\n\nHow did primaries change the conventions?\n\nThe introduction of the primary system in the early 1900s, in which states set up nominating contests, began to shift the way parties selected their nominees. However, primaries during the first half of the century were still secondary in importance to nominating conventions. Political leaders used the primaries to test the viability of possible candidates, but the conventions still determined the nomination outcome.\n\nWhat changed in 1968?\n\nThe most significant change to the party convention system came from the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago. Convention leaders chose Hubert Humphrey as the nominee despite Eugene McCarthy, an anti-war candidate, receiving more primary votes. The choice led to protests and violence outside the convention and political upheaval inside the hall. In the following years, both parties initiated reforms to ensure a majority of convention delegates were bound to the primary election outcomes.\n\nWhat changed after the 2016 election?\n\nDemocrats further changed their rules after the 2016 election when many \u201csuperdelegates\u201d \u2014 unpledged delegates who are party leaders \u2014 announced early support for Hillary Clinton, creating the perception that they were trying to influence the nominating contest against Bernie Sanders. Beginning in the 2020 election, the superdelegates were no longer allowed to vote in the first ballot at the convention, unless there was no doubt about the outcome of the contest.\n\nWhat does the Constitution say about party conventions?\n\nThe U.S. Constitution does not mention parties or their nomination processes. However, the Supreme Court has recognized political parties as being covered by the \u201cfreedom of association\u201d clause of the First Amendment. Over the years, courts have given political parties wide latitude on how they operate.\n\nWho are the convention delegates?\n\nThe roughly 4,000 Democratic delegates have strong ties to their political party. They can include local party workers, union members, office holders and fundraisers. While voters cast ballots for delegate slots tied to presidential candidates, the delegates themselves are often not chosen until weeks or months after the primary vote.\n\nDo the individual delegates matter?\n\nIf there is not a contested election, the identity of the individual delegates does not matter much to the average voter. The delegates will cheer at the convention and will formally nominate the party\u2019s presidential candidate. However, in the case of a contested election, the delegates could matter a great deal with the freedom to back any candidate.\n\nWho can delegates nominate?\n\n\u201cPledged\u201d delegates make up the majority of delegates \u2014 about 85% \u2014 and are pledged to back the candidate that voters elected. However, in the absence of that candidate, pledged delegates can back any nominee.\n\n\u201cSuperdelegates\u201d \u2014 who are leaders and elected officials in the Democratic Party \u2014 cannot vote on the first ballot in contested elections, but on subsequent ballots they can vote for any candidate they choose.\n\nWhat candidates are successful?\n\nHistory shows that nominees who prevail in contested conventions have a harder time winning the White House. A Pew Research study found that of the 60 Democratic and Republican nominating conventions from 1868 \u2014 the first post-Civil War election \u2014 to 1984, 18 candidates were nominated on multiple ballots. Of those, only seven \u2014 less than 40% \u2014 were elected president.",

The men and women of the Secret Service make it the greatest protective service in the world, with one of the most solemn and difficult missions in government. This independent review will examine what happened and provide actionable recommendations to ensure they carry out their no-fail mission most effectively and to prevent something like this from ever happening again.\u201d\n\nAs the President announced on July 14, the Administration is committed to sharing the results of this review with the American people. Secretary Mayorkas has also encouraged the panel members to notify him of recommendations that require immediate attention in real time, so changes can be quickly implemented if needed. The independent review will be conducted in such a way as to not interfere with the FBI\u2019s ongoing criminal investigation or any other criminal investigation.\n\nThe bipartisan panel brings to the investigation expertise in law enforcement, protective security, and homeland security at the local, state, and federal level. As Secretary of Homeland Security from 2009 to 2013, Janet Napolitano led the nation\u2019s efforts to prevent terrorist attacks, secure its borders, respond to natural disasters, and build domestic resiliency. She oversaw the U.S. Secret Service and also led critical enhancements to aviation security, including initiatives like the creation of TSA Pre\u2713\u00ae that bolster security while improving the travel experience and the expansion of programs like Global Entry and pre-clearance. She was the first woman and is to date the longest-serving Secretary of Homeland Security. She previously served as the twentieth president of the University of California, from 2013 to 2020 and governor of Arizona from 2003-2009. She is currently the founder of the Center for Security in Politics and Professor of Public Policy at the Goldman School of Public Policy at UC Berkeley.\n\nMs. Frances Townsend served as Assistant to President George W. Bush for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism from 2004 to 2008 and chaired the Homeland Security Council. She also served as Deputy National Security Advisor for Combatting Terrorism from May 2003 to May 2004. Ms. Townsend previously spent 13 years at the U.S. Department of Justice under the administrations of President George H. W. Bush, President Bill Clinton, and President George W. Bush. Ms. Townsend served on the Director of National Intelligence\u2019s Senior Advisory Group, the Central Intelligence Agency\u2019s External Advisory Board and the U.S. President\u2019s Intelligence Advisory Board.\n\nThe Hon. Mark Filip served as Deputy Attorney General from 2008-2009, overseeing the Department of Justice\u2019s criminal and civil enforcement efforts. He previously served as a federal court judge in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois after unanimous, bipartisan confirmation by the U.S. Senate following his nomination by President George W. Bush in 2003. In 2014, Mr. Filip served on the panel tasked with reviewing and recommending reforms to the United States Secret Service Protective Mission. Mr. Filip is currently a partner at the law firm of Kirkland & Ellis LLP, where he is a member of the firm\u2019s global management committee.\n\nChief David B. Mitchell brings four decades of law enforcement experience to this review. From 1990 to 1995, he served as Chief of Police for Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland, prior to being appointed Superintendent of the Maryland State Police, the seventh largest state police department in the nation. He led the force during the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and the D.C. sniper case in 2003. In 2004, he was appointed Secretary of the Department of Safety and Homeland Security for the State of Delaware. He currently serves as the Director of Public Safety and Chief of Police for the University of Maryland, College Park Campus.\n\n\u201cAll Americans share a concern about the safety of our public officials,\u201d said the members of the independent review panel in a joint statement. \u201cWe formed this bipartisan group to quickly identify improvements the U.S. Secret Service can implement to enhance their work. We must all work together to ensure events like July 13 do not happen again.\u201d\n\nIn response to the ongoing heightened threat environment, the Secret Service enhanced former President Trump\u2019s protection prior to the assassination attempt in July, and since July 16, the U.S. Secret Service made significant physical and technical enhancements related to securing the former President and other protectees.\n\nFor up to date information about the independent review, please visit DHS.gov/independent-review-2024-attempted-assassination.\n\n###",

        "text": "Biden drops out of 2024 reelection race, endorses Harris for nominee\nBiden drops out of 2024 reelection race, endorses Harris for nominee\n\ntoggle caption Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images\n\nFor more on Biden's decision and the now open 2024 race, head to the NPR Network's live updates page.\n\nPresident Biden is ending his run for a second term in office, a bombshell decision just 107 days before Election Day, bowing to pressure from his party after a disastrous debate at the end of June where he seemed to lose his train of thought.\n\nFor Biden, 81, the June 27 debate hardened a narrative that he was too old for another four years in the job. He insisted for three weeks that he would fight to make a comeback. But on Sunday he said he had changed his mind.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as president for the remainder of my term,\" he wrote in a letter addressed to \"my fellow Americans\" posted on social media.\n\nHe followed up with a post endorsing Vice President Harris as nominee, and urged his party to come together.\n\nHis decision comes just a month ahead the party\u2019s convention. But the path ahead to Nov. 5 is unclear, and it will be difficult for the party to get organized on time.\n\nNot since March 1968 has an incumbent U.S. president opted out of running for a second term \u2014 when President Lyndon B. Johnson, under pressure over the Vietnam War, dropped out of the presidential race during a live television address.\n\ntoggle caption Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images/AFP\n\nA fumbled debate touched off Democratic panic\n\nPolls have long shown that most voters disapproved of Biden's performance and thought he was too old for the job. But Biden\u2019s campaign team had argued that support would pick up once voters had the chance to think about former President Donald Trump\u2019s positions on abortion rights and his role in the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign thought the debate against Trump would kickstart this contrast. Scheduled months earlier than usual and with new rules, including no live audience and muted candidate microphones unless directed to speak, the debate was largely held on Biden\u2019s terms.\n\nThe goal was to send a clear message to Biden\u2019s doubters: that he could swat away concerns about his age by showing off his first-term record and decades-long political tenure.\n\nInstead, the president spoke with a noticeably raspy voice, seemed overwhelmed at times, and failed to make concise and clear points on a number of issues key to his reelection platform, notably protecting abortion access.\n\nThe performance sent Democrats into a panic, and prompted a steady drip of private and public calls for Biden to step back from the campaign and make way for a new candidate.\n\ntoggle caption Allison Joyce/Getty Images/Getty Images North America\n\nBiden's damage control tour\n\nBiden was defiant, saying his health was fine, and arguing that he was the most experienced and best-placed candidate to beat Trump.\n\nHe told ABC's George Stephanopoulos that only the \"Lord Almighty\" could make him drop out of the race, and privately met with Democratic lawmakers, governors, and donors to make his case.\n\nBiden publicly railed against the \"elites\" in his party. \"I don't care what those 'big names' think. They were wrong in 2020, they were wrong in 2022 about the red wave. They're wrong in 2024,\" Biden said on MSNBC's Morning Joe on July 8.\n\n\"Go ahead. Announce for president. Challenge me at the convention,\" he said.\n\ntoggle caption Kent Nishimura/AFP via Getty Images/AFP\n\nBiden did a series of campaign stops and speeches in key states, giving fiery speeches to try to demonstrate that he \"just had a bad night\" at the debate. He gave a lengthy solo press conference, and sat for televised interviews.\n\nHe wheeled out new attack lines on Trump in a retooled stump speech \u2014 only to have to immediately scale back his rhetoric in the wake of an assassination attempt on Trump. As Republicans gathered at their national convention, he tried to campaign in Nevada to create some counterprogramming \u2014 then got COVID, sending him into isolation in Delaware.\n\n\"We can't catch a break,\" a Biden adviser told NPR on the day that Trump gave his acceptance speech at the Republican convention.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nParty leaders conveyed concern that Biden would lose to Trump, and weigh on tough Senate and House races. Rep. Jamie Raskin told him he was like Red Sox pitcher Pedro Martinez, who in 2003, stayed in the game too long.\n\n\u201cThere is no shame in taking a well-deserved bow to the overflowing appreciation of the crowd when your arm is tired out, and there is real danger for the team in ignoring the statistics,\" Raskin warned.\n\ntoggle caption Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images/AFP\n\nNow, the race begins to replace Biden on the ticket\n\nBack in 2020, when Biden was running to become the Democratic presidential candidate, he had called himself a \"bridge\" to younger stars in his party as he campaigned with Harris, Whitmer and Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J.\n\n\"There's an entire generation of leaders you saw stand behind me. They are the future of this country,\" he said.\n\nIn the waning days of his campaign, Biden was asked why he hadn't taken the opportunity to pass the torch earlier.\n\n\"What changed was the gravity of the situation I inherited in terms of the economy, our foreign policy, and domestic division,\" Biden said.\n\n\"I realized ... my long time in the Senate had equipped me to have the wisdom to know how to deal with the Congress to get things done,\" he said. \"And I want to finish it -- to get that finished.\"\n\ntoggle caption Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images/Getty Images North America\n\nBut instead, Democrats are now under intense pressure to choose an alternate candidate in an extremely compressed time period that one Biden adviser said may be like the \"Hunger Games.\"\n\n\"What campaign team is going to rise from the ashes?\" the adviser asked. \u201cIt's gonna be ugly. It's gonna be dirty. It's gonna be messy.\u201d\n\nVice President Harris, 59, is expected to be a frontrunner \u2014 and Biden endorsed her. Other leaders have called for an open nomination process. But in the hours after the announcement, a flood of elected Democrats also threw their support behind her, including some of the governors who were thought to be potential competitors.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAlmost immediately, the Biden-Harris campaign was renamed \"Harris for President,\" and in the first five hours of her new presidential campaign, ActBlue said small-dollar donors contributed more than $27 million.\n\nLoading...\n\nNPR political reporter Elena Moore contributed to this report.",

        "text": "Biden Drops Out of Race, Scrambling the Campaign for the White House\nPresident Biden on Sunday abruptly abandoned his campaign for a second term under intense pressure from fellow Democrats and threw his support to Vice President Kamala Harris to lead their party in a dramatic last-minute bid to stop former President Donald J. Trump from returning to the White House.\n\n\u201cIt has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President,\u201d Mr. Biden said in a letter posted on social media. \u201cAnd while it has been my intention to seek re-election, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.\u201d\n\nMr. Biden then posted a subsequent online message endorsing Ms. Harris. \u201cMy very first decision as the party nominee in 2020 was to pick Kamala Harris as my Vice President,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd it\u2019s been the best decision I\u2019ve made. Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year. Democrats \u2014 it\u2019s time to come together and beat Trump. Let\u2019s do this.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s decision upended the race and set the stage for a raucous and unpredictable campaign unlike any in modern times, leaving Ms. Harris just 107 days to consolidate support from Democrats, establish herself as a credible national leader and prosecute the case against Mr. Trump. Recent polls have shown her competitive with and even slightly ahead of Mr. Trump.",

        "text": "Biden announces he is dropping out of 2024 U.S. Presidential election\nWASHINGTON, DC \u2014 On Sunday, President Joe Biden released a statement announcing that he is going to \"stand down\" in the 2024 Presidential election.\n\nIn a statement released on social media, President Biden says that while it has \"been [his] intention to see re-election, [he] believes it is in the best interest of my party and the country for [him] to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling [his] duties as President for the remainder of [his] term.\"\n\nFor weeks, President Joe Biden ignored calls from Democrats in Congress to drop out of the Presidential race. Arizona Congressmen Raul Grijalva and Greg Stanton were among the first to ask the President to step aside.\n\nWatch ABC Special Report coverage on the Democratic race:\n\nBiden dismissed his poor debate performance in June as a one-off, blaming the product of a lingering cold and fatigue.\n\nRegardless, his poll numbers continued to slip and, fearing he may hurt Democrats in down-ballot races in November, party leaders and donors joined in on urging him to step aside.\n\nBiden turned a deaf ear to those calls.\n\nOn Friday, his campaign announced that the President is anxious to return to the campaign trail next week after he recovers from COVID-19. Prior to the diagnosis, Biden sat down for interviews with ABC and NBC News, held an hour-long press conference following the NATO Summit, and attended campaign events before receptive audiences in Wisconsin, Michigan and Nevada.\n\nOn the road, the President often doubled down, telling a crowd in Wisconsin, \u201cI\u2019m staying in the race\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m in it to win it.\u201d\n\nBut the calls to end his campaign only grew louder.\n\nIt is a rarity in history to force a President to either leave office or, in this case, to not seek re-election. But it has happened.\n\nOn Aug. 7, 1974, John Rhodes, an Arizona Republican who was the minority leader of the House of Representatives, joined Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater and Senate Minority Leader Hugh Scott of Pennsylvania in telling President Richard Nixon his attempts to survive Watergate were pointless.\n\nTwo days later, Nixon resigned.\n\nFor Biden, his insistence on remaining at the top of the ticket was eventually drowned out by those who said no. Now that the terms of surrender are hashed out, the Democrats move on and hope there is still enough time to defeat Donald Trump.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump officially secured the Republican presidential nomination at the Republican National Convention, days after he was injured in an assassination attempt at a campaign rally. It\u2019s unclear who the Democratic nominee will be upon Biden\u2019s exit from the race.",

        "text": "Presidential predictor Allan Lichtman tells Democrats after Biden drops out: 'Get smart and unite'\nIt was a historic day as President Joe Biden announced that he was dropping his bid for re-election and throwing his support to Vice President Kamala Harris for the Democratic party\u2019s 2024 presidential nominee.\n\nThe abrupt announcement made in a social media post Sunday afternoon thrust the party into a pit of chaos and speculation. But presidential election predictor Allan Lichtman \u2013 who has correctly predicted the winner of nearly every U.S. presidential race since 1984 \u2013 says there's still a way forward for Democrats despite the tumult.\n\nLichtman's predictions use a system he developed called \"The 13 Keys to the White House\" to determine the outcome of the elections.\n\n\"The keys gauge the strength and performance of the White House party,\" Lichtman told FOX 5 Sunday.\n\nHe describes the \"Keys\u2019\" as a \"vote up or down on the strength and performance of the White House party.\"\n\n\"And if six or more of the keys go against them, they are predicted to be the losers,\" he says. Here are Lichtman's 13 Keys:\n\nKEY 1 (Party Mandate)\n\nKEY 2 (Contest)\n\nKEY 3 (Incumbency)\n\nKEY 4 (Third Party)\n\nKEY 5 (Short-Term Economy)\n\nKEY 6 (Long-Term Economy)\n\nKEY 7 (Policy Change)\n\nKEY 8 (Social Unrest)\n\nKEY 9 (Scandal)\n\nKEY 10 (Foreign/Military Failure)\n\nKEY 11 (Foreign/Military Success)\n\nKEY 12 (Incumbent Charisma)\n\nKEY 13 (Challenger Charisma)\n\n\"With Biden dropping out, they [Democrats] lose one more key: the incumbency key,\" Lichtman said. \"But they can still preserve another key: the contest key if, finally, the Democrats get smart and unite behind Kamala Harris as the consensus nominee, they keep that key in line.\"\n\nLichtman says so far, it appears that's exactly what the Democratic Party is doing but there is still some speculation about whether all the party members are going to fall in line.\n\nIt won't take long to find out though. The real test of the party's unity will come at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago next month.\n\nLitchman says when some of those questions are answered, he'll be able to make a final prediction.\n\n\"There are four shaky keys that I haven't decided and I haven't made a final prediction yet. They are third party, social unrest and foreign/military failure and success. Provided Harris becomes the consensus nominee, three of those four keys would have to fall to predict the Democrat's defeat,\" Lichtman said. \"If she doesn't become the consensus nominee, only two would have to fall.\"",

[+] Montgomery County Community College January 5, 2024 in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania. In his first campaign event of the 2024 election season, Biden stated that democracy and fundamental freedoms are under threat if former U.S. President Donald Trump returns to the White House. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images) Getty Images\n\nKey Facts\n\nThe president made the announcement in a letter, saying he intends \u201cto focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.\u201d He endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris shortly after releasing the letter, saying he gives Harris his \"full support\" and calling his choice to pick her as his 2020 running mate the \"best decision I\u2019ve made.\" Biden stepped down after more than three dozen Democrats in Congress urged him to do so, and after a flurry of reports that Democratic leaders in Congress were working behind the scenes to push Biden to end his bid. Biden has faced questions for months about whether he is too old to serve another term, but the party largely stood behind him until his disastrous June 27 debate performance, when Biden often appeared bewildered, gave disjointed answers and spoke in a soft, raspy voice\u2014leading to an onslaught of backlash from pundits, major newspapers, celebrities, donors and elected Democrats. Biden\u2019s decision to leave the race at this stage in the election cycle is unprecedented in modern politics and sets up a mad dash to choose his replacement, just weeks before the party is set to formally choose its nominee in a virtual roll call the first week of August.\n\nWhen Will A New Nominee Be Chosen?\n\nDemocrats plan to hold a virtual roll call to formally select their nominee as soon as Aug. 1 and before Aug. 7, ahead of the party\u2019s Aug. 19 convention. The party initially planned the early roll call to ensure Biden would be on the ballot in Ohio, which previously required nominees to be confirmed 90 days before the election. Ohio has since revised its law, but it doesn\u2019t take effect until Sept. 1, so Democrats have said they will move forward with the early nomination anyway.\n\nHow Will Democrats Replace Biden?\n\nThe approximately 4,700 Democratic delegates will choose a new candidate by majority vote. About 4,000 delegates are \u201cpledged\u201d to Biden, but by stepping down, he effectively releases them from their obligation to vote for him. The 700 \u201cunpledged\u201d delegates\u2014also known as superdelegates and can vote for whoever they please\u2014are allowed to vote in a second round if a candidate does not secure the majority votes needed to win in the first round.\n\nWhat Is An Open Convention?\n\nAn open convention would occur if multiple candidates are presented to delegates at the convention, and Biden hasn\u2019t endorsed a replacement, leaving his delegates free to vote for anyone.\n\nWhat Is A \u2018mini-Primary\u2019?\n\nThe process of choosing a new nominee isn\u2019t exactly clear, but some have floated a \u201cmini primary\u201d involving a series of campaign events\u2014such as debates, high-profile interviews or town halls\u2014between potential Biden replacements prior to delegates casting their votes. Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., has said he would support Harris as the nominee if Biden dropped out and the party coalesced around her, but he has also suggested Democrats could conduct a \u201cmini primary\u201d to survey other candidates, an idea New York Times columnist Ezra Klein and longtime Democratic political consultant James Carville also endorsed.\n\nWho Are The Top Contenders To Replace Biden?\n\nHarris is the top contender, but other names commonly floated include California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro. Previous Democratic presidential candidates Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Sens. Cory Booker, D-N.J., and Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., are also among the potential contenders. No Democrats who have been seriously floated as potential replacements have said they\u2019re interested in the 2024 nomination.\n\nHow Is Kamala Harris Polling?\n\nSimilar to Biden and slightly better than all other potential replacements surveyed, but still worse than Trump, according to most surveys. A mid-July YouGov poll (margin of error 3.1) found Biden would lose to Trump by two points and Harris would lose by three, while a Reuters/Ipsos poll found both Biden and Harris are virtually statistically tied with Trump. In a CNN/SSRS poll (margin of error 3.5) conducted days after the debate, Harris outperformed Biden, and three other potential candidates commonly floated to replace him, in a hypothetical matchup against Trump\u2014but she would still lose to the former president by two points (while Biden would lose to Trump by six points).\n\nWhat Do Supporters\u2014and Critics\u2014say About Harris?\n\nSeveral prominent Democrats explicitly mentioned Harris as the most viable option to replace Biden prior to him announcing his resignation from the race. Clyburn has said he believes Harris would do \u201cvery well\u201d at the top of the ticket and the party should do everything it can to \u201cbolster\u201d her would-be candidacy. Harris has downsides, however, including a relatively low approval rating (though it\u2019s likely a direct reflection of Biden\u2019s own low approval rating) and a series of negative stories about her job performance as vice president, including that she\u2019s been largely absent from the public eye. Her record as a state and local prosecutor has also drawn ire from some progressives who have accused her of not doing enough to investigate police misconduct and have pointed out her history of prosecuting marijuana-related offenses. Harris\u2019 views on criminal justice seem to have evolved however, as she\u2019s endorsed Biden\u2019s pardoning of federal marijuana-related convictions and she has spoken out against the notion that putting more police in the streets increases public safety. Former Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, slammed Harris\u2019 detractors in endorsing her to replace Biden in a recent Newsweek op-ed, calling her \u201ca joy to hang out with . . . brilliant, compassionate, engaging, funny and totally down to earth.\u201d Harris, he said, \u201ccan energize the electorate and govern effectively.\u201d\n\nWhat Was Trump\u2019s Reaction?\n\nFormer President Donald Trump blasted Biden in a Truth Social post following the announcement, saying \u201cCrooked Joe Biden was not fit to run for President, and is certainly not fit to serve - And never was!\u201d",

        "text": "The Last Time an American Political Party Declined to Nominate Their Incumbent President for Reelection\nWith the news that President Joe Biden is dropping out of the presidential race, the 2024 election cycle is entering uncharted territory.\n\nWhile many questions remain about who will replace Biden on the Democratic party ticket, this isn't the first time in history that an incumbent president lost their party's nomination while they were running for reelection. (Though Biden framed this decision as his choice, it was clearly at the pressure of the Democratic caucus and polls showing the opinions of voters.)\n\nThe only other elected president to lose their party's nomination was President Franklin Pierce, back in 1856, while other incumbents (like Calvin Coolidge and Lyndon B. Johnson) have decided not to seek reelection. And, in the 19th century, four separate presidents\u2014all who became president following the death or assassination of the incumbent\u2014did not win their party's nomination, losing during the convention.\n\nHere, a brief history of the other times incumbent presidents lost their party's nomination.\n\nThe only other elected president to lose his party's nomination: Franklin Pierce\n\nHeritage Images // Getty Images Pierce, November 1852.\n\nIn 1856, Franklin Pierce, the 14th president of the U.S., was running for re-election. But Pierce's position against the abolitionist movement, his enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act, and the fact that he signed into law the Kansas-Nebraska Act in 1854\u2014which repealed the Missouri Compromise and left open the question of slavery in new territories\u2014made him unpopular among his own Democratic Party.\n\nAt the 1856 Democratic National Convention, delegates ditched Pierce and instead nominated former Secretary of State James Buchanan. Pierce ultimately endorsed Buchanan, who won the election and served as the 15th president from 1857 to 1861. Pierce was the first (and until Biden, the only) elected incumbent president who was did not get his party's nomination for a second term.\n\nOther incumbent presidents that also lost their party's nomination\n\nPrint Collector // Getty Images Andrew Johnson, 17th President of the United States, was Abraham Lincoln\u2019s vice-president and succeeded Lincoln as president after his assassination.\n\nThroughout U.S. history, four other incumbent presidents lost their party's nomination, but none of them were elected for their first term\u2014all became president following the death the incumbent president. They are, in chronological order:\n\nJohn Tyler, who became the 10th president in 1841 upon the death of William Henry Harrison, was expelled from the Whig party just a few months later. Therefore, he wasn't eligible to earn the Whig party nomination in 1844, which instead nominated Henry Clay. Clay would go on to lose to the Democratic nominee, James K. Polk.\n\nMillard Filmore, the 13th president, ascended to the president upon the death of Zachary Taylor in 1850. At the 1852 Whig National Convention, Taylor, whose enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act was unpopular with Northerners, lost the nomination to General-in-Chief Winfield Scott. Scott lost the 1852 election to Franklin Pierce (above), who would go on to lose his own party's nomination four years later.\n\nAndrew Johnson, the 17th president, took the office of president in 1865 upon the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln, a Republican, had selected Johnson, a Southern Democrat, to run on a unity ticket in 1864. So during the 1868 election, Johnson tried to earn the Democratic nomination but lost to Horatio Seymour, the former Governor of New York. Seymour lost in the general election to Ulysses S. Grant.\n\nChester Arthur, the 21st president, succeeded to the presidency after the assassination of James Garfield in 1881. Arthur was unsuccessful in clinching the Republican nominee for a second term, losing to Secretary of State James G. Blaine. Blaine would lose in the general election to Grover Cleveland.\n\nRelated Story A History of Presidential Assassination Attempts\n\nIncumbent presidents who decided not to run for reelection\n\nBettmann President Lyndon Johnson during a nationwide television broadcast wherein he announced would not be seeking re-election, March 1968.\n\nBiden technically also falls into the category of incumbents who decided not to seek a second term, though he initially did try to get reelected. There have been seven other elected incumbents in American history who didn't seek a second term: James K. Polk (in 1848), James Buchanan (in 1860), Rutherford B. Hayes (in 1880), Calvin Coolidge (in 1928), Harry S. Truman (in 1952), and Lyndon B. Johnson (in 1968).\n\nCoolidge, Truman, and Johnson all served more than four years, but they were still eligible to run again; Coolidge became president upon the death of Warren G. Harding in 1923, Truman succeeded to the presidency upon the death of Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1945, and Johnson took office upon the assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963.",

        "text": "Biden drops out of presidential race, endorses Harris\nA man holds a sign showing his appreciation for US President Joe Biden along Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House in Washington, DC, on July 21, 2024. SAMUEL CORUM / AFP\n\nUS President Joe Biden announced Sunday, July 21, that he is dropping out of his reelection battle against Donald Trump, in a historic move that plunges the already turbulent 2024 White House race into uncharted territory. Biden endorsed vice president Kamala Harris for the Democratic nomination at the party's August convention in Chicago.\n\n\"While it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term,\" Biden said in a letter posted on X.\n\nBiden's decision came as he has been isolating at his Delaware beach house after being diagnosed with Covid-19 last week, huddling with a shrinking circle of close confidants and family members about his political future. Biden said he would address the nation later this week to provide \"detail\" about his decision.\n\nHarris, who is the first female, Black and South Asian vice president in US history, will now be aiming to become its first female commander-in-chief. \"Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year,\" Biden said on X. \"Democrats \u2013 it's time to come together and beat Trump. Let's do this.\" In a statement following the announcement, Kamala Harris praised Joe Biden's \"patriotic\" decision not to seek reelection and vowed to win the Democratic nomination and defeat Donald Trump. \"With this selfless and patriotic act, President Biden is doing what he has done throughout his life of service: putting the American people and our country above everything else.\"\n\nRead more Subscribers only US election: Kamala Harris becomes tempting alternative to Joe Biden\n\nTrump quickly reacted, saying Biden had not been \"fit to run\" or \"fit to serve\" as president.\n\nBiden spent more than three weeks resisting calls to step down following the shock of the June 27 debate, at one point insisting that only the \"Lord Almighty\" could convince him to back out. In a bid to show he was up to the job, he gave a number of interviews and what was billed as a \"big boy\" press conference in which he took numerous questions, but made further gaffes including calling Harris \"Vice President Trump.\"\n\nA tide of voices within his own party calling on him to go, starting with donor and actor George Clooney and ending with former president Barack Obama, sealed his fate.\n\nIsolation\n\nThe end finally came shortly after Biden had been diagnosed with Covid-19, forcing him off the campaign trail and into isolation in Rehoboth Beach. Biden's announcement is the latest jolt to a campaign for the White House that both political parties see as the most consequential election in generations, coming just days after the attempted assassination of Trump at a Pennsylvania rally.\n\nBiden joins a small club of US presidents who have decided to throw in the towel after just one term, with the last being Lyndon Johnson in 1968 \u2013 a year also marked by political turmoil and violence. Johnson's replacement as nominee, then-vice president Hubert Humphrey, went on to lose heavily to Richard Nixon.\n\nBut Democrats are counting on Harris to fare better, and hoping that she can prevent convicted felon Trump from making a sensational comeback to the Oval Office. In recent weeks, the Biden campaign has reportedly been quietly carrying out a head-to-head survey of voters measuring how she matched up against Trump. While Harris struggled to make an impact in her first years in the White House, she has emerged in the last year as a strong performer on the campaign trail on key messages such as abortion rights.\n\nThe former prosecutor has also made much of her life story as the first woman in US history to hold the vice presidency, as well as the first person of Black and South Asian origin. Barring opposition from her party, Harris is now set to be nominated at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago on August 19 in what promises to be a dramatic moment \u2013 and a heartrending one for Biden.\n\nNo automatic coronation\n\nShortly after President Joe Biden announced Sunday that he would drop his reelection campaign, Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison had a message: There would be no automatic coronation for his replacement. \"In the coming days, the party will undertake a transparent and orderly process to move forward,\" Harrison said in a statement. \"This process will be governed by established rules and procedures of the party. Our delegates are prepared to take seriously their responsibility in swiftly delivering a candidate to the American people.\"\n\nThe comment reflected the reality that while vice president Kamala Harris is emerging as the prohibitive favorite to become the party's nominee is not so simple. Harris has to formally secure the nomination from the around 4,700 Democratic convention delegates. She spent part of Sunday calling elected officials and delegates to solidify their support.\n\nAmong others, endorsements came from Democratic big shots such as Bill and Hillary Clinton; prominent US senators; a wide swath of House representatives (such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez) and members of the influential Congressional Black Caucus; Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, and Arizona Senator Mark Kelly \u2013 each from a swing state and mentioned as a possible running mate for Harris \u2013 endorsed Harris Sunday evening. Shortly followed those seen as potential rivals for the nomination, such as California Governor Gavin Newsom.\n\nWest Virginia Senator Joe Manchin, who left the Democratic Party earlier this year to become an independent, is considering re-registering as a Democrat to vie for the nomination against the vice president, according to a longtime adviser to Manchin. As for the still highly influential former Democratic president Barack Obama, he cautioned that \"uncharted waters\" lay ahead.\n\nThe fast-moving political situation remains volatile just months before the November election.",

As VP, Harris has been particularly outspoken on artificial intelligence (AI). She warned against the \u201cexistential\u201d threat of AI and said it could \u201cendanger the very existence of humanity,\u201d in a November 2023 address.\n\nAlso read | U.S. Presidential Elections 2024 LIVE updates: Joe Biden withdraws from presidential race\n\nIn a meeting with tech execs like Microsoft\u2019s Satya Nadella, OpenAI\u2019s Sam Altman and Alphabet\u2019s Sundar Pichai, Harris warned that they have a \u201cmoral\u201d obligation to guard against AI\u2019s possible dangers. She backed an AI executive order from President Joe Biden that sought stronger protections for consumers, singling out AI-generated scam calls and the impacts of unlabelled AI-generated content.\n\nPrior to joining the Biden administration, as California attorney general, Harris sued eBay over the ecommerce company\u2019s anticompetitive hiring practices surrounding a no-poaching agreement with Intuit. The lawsuit led to a nearly $4 million settlement in 2014.\n\nIn a different lawsuit against Houzz, she compelled the startup to hire a chief privacy officer after allegations that the home design app had recorded sales calls without proper notification and consent.\n\n(For top technology news of the day, subscribe to our tech newsletter Today\u2019s Cache)\n\nShe has also been at the forefront of curtailing distribution of pornography on social media, particularly \u201crevenge porn,\u201d a practice involving the posting of explicit photos without the subject\u2019s consent. She took credit for a pressure campaign that led to Facebook, Google, Microsoft and others taking measures to remove certain explicit images.\n\n(with inputs from Reuters)",

        "text": "US election 2024: Where does Kamala Harris stand on regulating big tech and AI?\nUS Presidential Election Results 2024: The 2024 US presidential election is in its eleventh hour with Republican nominee Donald Trump leading with 230 electoral votes while Democrat Kamala Harris trails with 169 votes.\n\nIt is safe to say that incumbent Vice President Harris\u2019 presidential campaign was more future-focused than her opponent, with a clear contrast in the two campaign slogans: Harris\u2019 \u201cwe are not going back\u201d and Trump\u2019s \u201cmake America great again.\u201d\n\nWith the results getting down to the wire, let\u2019s take a look at what a Harris presidency would mean for tech policy in the US and elsewhere.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKamala Harris\u2019 ties with the tech industry\n\nThe presidential hopeful has a long relationship with the tech industry as her roots can be traced back to Silicon Valley, according to a report by TechCrunch. Before entering politics, Harris was San Francisco\u2019s first female district attorney and later, she became California\u2019s first female attorney general, the Los Angeles Times reported.\n\nDuring her career as a prosecutor, Harris launched a data transparency project called OpenJustice which is a public platform that serves as a record of interactions between law enforcement officials and community members. The dashboard was reportedly built by combining the statistical data of the California Department of Justice with other public datasets.\n\nIn 2016, Harris was elected to the US Senate where she introduced a bill called the Digital Service Act that proposed to provide funds to state and local governments so that they could establish their own tech units.\n\n\n\nIn 2018, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg appeared before the US Senate Judiciary Committee to answer questions about how the tech giant handles users\u2019 private data in the context of the Cambridge Analytica controversy. One of the lawmakers to quiz Zuckerberg was Harris who pointed out that the billionaire CEO had not answered key questions such as, whether Facebook users continue to be tracked even after logging off or if Facebook could access users\u2019 browser histories.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been asked several critical questions for which you don\u2019t have answers,\u201d Harris told Zuckerberg.\n\nWhile Harris was not reluctant to rebuke tech CEOs as a senator, she faced criticism for not doing enough to curb big tech dominance in her role as California\u2019s attorney general. In fact, a Huffington Post report found thousands of emails that reportedly demonstrate Harris\u2019 soft touch approach towards big tech companies.\n\nWhat is Kamala Harris\u2019 approach to AI, tech policy?\n\nWhile she has openly called for more regulation of tech giants such as Meta, Harris has also been hesitant in supporting calls for the breakup of such companies. \u201cI believe that the tech companies have got to be regulated in a way that we can ensure and the American consumer can be certain that their privacy is not being compromised,\u201d she had told The New York Times in a 2020 interview.\n\nInterestingly, Harris does not support banning the popular social media app TikTok in the country. \u201cWe need to deal with the owner, and we have national security concerns about the owner of TikTok, but we have no intention to ban TikTok,\u201d she had said in an interview with ABC News this year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHarris\u2019 views on cryptocurrency are not very well known; though, she could continue to follow the same regulatory approach as the Biden administration. But she has been fairly vocal when it comes to artificial intelligence (AI), specifically expressing concerns about the more immediate threats that AI poses to society.\n\n\u201cLet us be clear, there are additional threats that also demand our action. Threats that are currently causing harm, and which to many people also feel existential\u2026 when people around the world cannot discern fact from fiction because of a flood of AI enabled myths and disinformation. I ask, is that not existential for democracy?\u201d the 59-year-old vice president had said during the AI safety summit held in the UK last year.\n\nIn 2023, President Biden passed a sweeping executive order that called for companies to set new standards around the development of AI. As part of the Biden administration, Harris also announced new directives for US government agencies that require them to appoint chief AI officers, publish a list of AI systems they use, and ensure that these AI systems do not endanger the rights and safety of the American people.\n\nHarris has reportedly enjoyed the support of several Silicon Valley venture capitalists such as John Doerr and Ron Conway. Since launching her 2024 bid, she has bagged the endorsement of LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman, Netflix chairman Reed Hastings, and billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban, among others.",

        "text": "Biden\u2019s decision to bow out goes viral on Chinese social media\nThe news of U.S. President Joe Biden\u2019s decision to end his reelection campaign quickly became a trending topic on Chinese social media platforms Monday.\n\nIn a statement released on Sunday afternoon U.S. time, Biden announced his decision to not run for a second term and vowed to focus his energy on fulfilling his duties as president.\n\nSo far, the Chinese government has remained tight lipped about the decision. At a regular press briefing on Monday, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning declined to comment, and said the \u201cpresidential election is an internal affair of the United States.\u201d\n\nOnline, however, the entry \u201cBiden withdrew from the election\u201d attracted more than 400 million views on the China\u2019s microblogging site Weibo and tens of thousands of comments.\n\nOther topics went viral as well. Topics such as \u201cZelensky respects Biden\u2019s decision to withdraw from the election,\u201d \u201cHarris praised Biden,\u201d and \u201cTrump thinks Harris is easier to beat\u201d were all in the top 20 searches Monday on Weibo, which is similar to the social media site X.\n\nSeveral major media outlets in China, including the state-run Xinhua News Agency, People\u2019s Daily, and the Global Times, covered Biden\u2019s withdrawal from the race extensively.\n\nMany Chinese netizens expressed the view that Biden\u2019s decision ensures that Trump will win the election in November while some said things have suddenly changed for Ukraine, referring to Trump\u2019s repeated criticism of U.S. military aid to Ukraine. \u201cTonight will be a sleepless night for Zelensky,\u201d Chinese netizen \u201cYo-Huai-To-Bi\u201d from northeastern Shandong province wrote on Weibo.\n\nOther Chinese netizens argued that the United States will continue to compete with China and try to contain the country\u2019s rise regardless of who wins the election in November.\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be too happy about this news because Trump will likely continue Biden\u2019s strategies toward China and he might roll out harsher measures,\u201d a netizen called \u201cBIGTREE33\u201d from China\u2019s southeastern Fujian Province wrote on Weibo.\n\nSome Chinese commentators said the Democratic Party will have very little chance of winning the presidential election in November without Biden.\n\n\u201cNo faction in the Democratic Party can rebuild a campaign that can challenge Trump within a short time, so after Biden withdrew from the race, the Democrats will return to a very divided situation,\u201d Jia Min, an affiliated researcher at Shanghai Development Research Foundation, told Shanghai Morning News in a video.\n\nHu Xijin, the former editor-in-chief of China\u2019s state-run tabloid Global Times, wrote on X that whoever becomes the Democratic Party\u2019s presidential candidate will make little difference to the presidential race in November.\n\n\u201cBecause Trump\u2019s personality is so outstanding, American voters are now divided into two groups: Trump lovers & Trump haters,\u201d he wrote, adding that November\u2019s election will be a choice between Trump or \u201canyone.\u201d\n\nHarris vs. Trump\n\nAfter Biden endorsed U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris to be the presidential candidate for the Democratic Party and Harris vowed to win the Democratic Party\u2019s nomination, the entry \u201cCould Harris defeat Trump\u201d quickly became a trending topic on Weibo.\n\nMore Chinese netizens seem to believe Harris has very little chance of beating Trump in the presidential election. \u201cIf Hillary Clinton couldn\u2019t beat Trump back then, Harris would just be a joke,\u201d a netizen named \u201cFalling in Love with Jia-tze-hu\u201d from Shandong Province wrote on Weibo.\n\nSome Chinese analysts said Harris lacks the experience and achievement to serve as the next president of the United States.\n\n\u201cLooking at Harris's overall track record, her performance as vice president has not been particularly outstanding, and she has not achieved satisfactory results,\u201d Sun Chenghao, a fellow at the Center for International Security and Strategy at Tsinghua University, told Chinese online media outlet the Paper.\n\nBeijing-Washington rivalry to continue\n\nWhile Biden\u2019s decision to pull out of the presidential race will likely shape the development of the U.S. presidential election, some analysts say the Chinese government may think that these developments won\u2019t change the fact that Beijing and Washington are engaged in an intense competition.\n\n\u201cBeijing\u2019s view is that the U.S. and China are in this rivalry, and it will continue no matter who runs in the election,\u201d Ian Chong, a political scientist at the National University of Singapore, told VOA by phone.\n\nOther experts say the Chinese government may not have clear expectations about how different candidates may focus on issues related to China.\n\n\u201cDespite being the vice president, Harris hasn't said that much on foreign policy, especially compared to the known track records of both Biden and Trump,\u201d said Timothy Rich, a political scientist at Western Kentucky University.\n\n\u201cSo, a known Trump, however erratic, may be easier [for Beijing] to prepare for than Harris,\u201d he told VOA in a written response.\n\nIf November\u2019s election becomes a race between Trump and Harris, Rich thinks a potential Trump victory would mean more tariffs on Chinese commodities and a more explicit view of trade as a zero-sum game. A potential Harris administration, he adds, may adopt a more nuanced approach to address Washington\u2019s trade relationship with China.\n\nOn the issue of Taiwan, Rich said the fact that the Republican National Committee excluded Taiwan from the party platform may suggest Trump is \u201cthinking transactionally about how cutting off support for Taiwan could lead to some big trade agreement with China.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn contrast, I can\u2019t see a Harris administration deviating on support for Taiwan much from her predecessor,\u201d he told VOA.",

Biden: \"It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President\" Biden gave his \"full support and endorsement\" for Vice President Kamala Harris to be Democratic Party's nominee .",
        "text": "Biden drops out of 2024 presidential race\nHe struggled to recover from a disastrous debate and Democrats' doubts.\n\nPresident Joe Biden is leaving the 2024 race after a halting debate performance against Donald Trump led to questions from Democrats about his age, ability to carry out his campaign and whether he could serve a second term.\n\nBiden said in a statement posted Sunday that he will \"stand down.\"\n\n\"It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President,\" he wrote, in part, in a letter posted on X. \"And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.\"\n\n\"I will speak to the Nation later this week in more detail about my decision,\" he added. First lady Jill Biden reposted her husband's post announcing he's dropping out with a hearts emoji.\n\nIn another post on X, Biden gave his \"full support and endorsement\" for Vice President Kamala Harris to be the Democratic Party's nominee.\n\nPresident Joe Biden speaks from the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington, July 14, 2024. Susan Walsh/AP\n\nThe stunning move upends what has been a long general election rematch between Biden and Trump, both of whom handily won their party's primaries, with less than four months until the November contest.\n\nWhile concerns about Biden's age plagued him since he launched his reelection campaign in April 2023, they reached a fever pitch following his showdown with Trump at the CNN debate in Atlanta in late June.\n\nBiden, who at 81 is the oldest sitting president in history, spoke with a hoarse voice that his team attributed to a cold. But coupled with his meandering answers and inability to hit Trump hard on key Democratic issues, his performance left some pundits and politicians speechless.\n\nAPresident Joe Biden delivers remarks during the CNN Presidential Debate at the CNN Studios, June 27, 2024, in Atlanta. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nThe White House and campaign chalked up the performance as a \"bad night.\" Biden defiantly insisted he would remain in the race, repeatedly telling Democrats he was the best option to defeat Trump.\n\n\"I convinced myself of two things. I'm the most qualified person to beat him, and I know how to get things done,\" Biden told ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos in his first post-debate television interview.\n\n\"Look. I mean, if the Lord Almighty came down and said, 'Joe, get outta the race,' I'd get outta the race. The Lord Almighty's not comin' down,\" Biden said at the time.\n\nBut early polling showed the debate's negative impact. In 538's national polling average, Trump now leads by 2 percentage points over Biden, while the two candidates were just about tied on the day of the June 27 debate.\n\nPresident Joe Biden speaks alongside Prime Minister of the Czech Republic Petr Fiala before a bilateral meeting in the Oval Office of the White House, April 15, 2024. Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n\nAnd despite Biden and his campaign's furious attempts at damage control, including a press conference after concluding a NATO summit in Washington where he took reporter questions for nearly an hour and tried to make the case he must \"finish the job,\" a steady drumbeat of Democratic lawmakers and public figures called on him to step aside as the nominee.\n\nThe number of congressional Democrats who called on him to step aside rose to 40 by the time Biden announced his decision to leave the race.\n\n\"The one thing I know for sure is that we can do better than Joe Biden as a person who can deliver our message in this election cycle,\" Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., had previously told ABC News. \"And we have time to do that. And we should.\"\n\nBiden was also taken off the campaign trail these past few days due to a case of COVID-19, which he is recovering from at his residence in Rehoboth, Delaware.\n\nTo emphasize how closely held Biden's decision to exit the race was, a source familiar with the matter told ABC Senior White House Correspondent Selina Wang that Biden informed his senior team that he changed his mind about staying in the race at 1:45 p.m. Sunday.\n\nBiden's letter came out at 1:46 p.m. -- so his staff was told just one minute before the public announcement that he was dropping out.\n\nBefore Biden's revelation Sunday, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer had publicly said they supported Biden making a decision during the party's turmoil. But privately, they were said to have been sympathetic to the view held by a growing number of congressional Democrats that Biden was on a path to lose to Trump.\n\nSchumer went to Delaware to speak to Biden and made the case it would be best if Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential race, ABC News Chief Washington Correspondent Jonathan Karl reported.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris speaks at a campaign event in Greensboro, N.C., July 11, 2024. Chuck Burton/AP\n\nAs scrutiny of Biden intensified, focus increased on Vice President Kamala Harris as a possible choice to replace him as the Democratic nominee.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have picked her unless I thought she was qualified to be president,\u201d Biden said of Harris at his press conference on July 11.\n\nThe Democratic Party's dysfunction stood in sharp contrast to the steadfast party unity shown to Trump, despite his own struggles that include a historic conviction, during the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n\nAs he accepted his party's nomination, Trump spoke of the \"love in the room\" and enthusiasm for what's to come.\n\n\"I am running to be president for all of America, not half of America, because there is no victory in winning for half of America,\" Trump said.\n\nHarris, in a statement Sunday, thanked Biden for his \"decades of service to our country\" and said she \"will do everything in my power to unite the Democratic Party -- and unite our nation -- to defeat Donald Trump and his extreme Project 2025 agenda.\"\n\n\"I am honored to have the President\u2019s endorsement and my intention is to earn and win this nomination,\" Vice President Harris said.\n\nABC News' Selina Wang and Fritz Farrow contributed to this report.",

        "text": "The latest US presidential twist throws the race wide open \u2013 but what could it mean for Australia? | Arthur Sinodinos\nThe 2024 US presidential election is proof that in America nothing succeeds like excess.\n\nThe standing down of President Biden is just the latest twist in this extraordinary race \u2013 and could be the circuit breaker the Democrats are looking for. It removes age as an issue for them and potentially refocuses the campaign, with Kamala Harris the standard bearer.\n\nShe is within striking distance of Trump in national polls and involves the least disruptive transition to the Democrat campaign. Trump may seek to ridicule \u2018laughing\u2019 Kamala but that could backfire with voters, particularly women. She will need a running mate who can appeal in the swing states and has a compelling personal story. This will inject new energy into the campaign.\n\nUndoubtedly, Trump has momentum. The former president\u2019s acceptance speech at the RNC did not chart a new policy direction or presage a kinder, gentler politics. That is not what fuels the Maga engine. Trump has harnessed the anger of those Americans who feel like outsiders in their own country, threatened by rapid change, identity politics and left behind by the widening of income and wealth inequalities.\n\nThe selection of JD Vance, a smart and articulate convert to Maga is a signal that Trump is not looking to appeal to the ever-shrinking pool of moderates or independents. In Trump\u2019s eyes, Maga is here to stay, and Vance is its tribune.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 best strategy now is to turn the election into a referendum on Trump\u2019s negatives, which they define as the chaos of his first term and threat to American institutions. The departure of President Biden provides that opportunity.\n\nUS elections are determined by turnout. The Maga base is energised by Trump\u2019s \u2018resurrection\u2019. Democrats will now have to pick themselves off the floor and push the buttons of various sections of the electorate to motivate turnout.\n\nIn many ways, this is now a race between Vance and Harris, who is the most likely Democrat nominee. The age issue has been turned on its head. Vance\u2019s views come into focus now that he is only a heartbeat away from the presidency.\n\nMany women will vote to send a message on restriction of abortion rights. Vance\u2019s strong views on restricting abortion rights provide a perfect foil for this argument. Harris is best placed to run that argument. Trump has soft-pedalled on the issue in recognition of its lethality to his campaign.\n\nWhat does this mean for Australia and the rest of the world? Do not expect much change in international economic policy from either side of politics.\n\nTrump upended trade policy in 2016, forcing Hillary Clinton to disown her administration\u2019s centrepiece trade strategy for the Indo-Pacific, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which dealt a major blow to the US pivot to the region. Since then, market access agreements have been off the table for both sides of politics with more interest in how to tilt the playing field in favour of US firms by imposing higher labour and environmental costs on foreign competitors.\n\nCovid 19 and the technological cold war with China are also reshaping industrial supply chains with more reshoring and friend-shoring in the offing. The Aukus capability pact and the Quad focus on critical and emerging tech are leading examples of this trend. Both Trump and a reelected Democrat administration will double down on this, with perhaps more onshoring in Trump\u2019s case.\n\nOne major point of difference is climate change policy and international cooperation. Trump is likely to again withdraw from the Paris agreement and promises to drill for more oil from day one, further extending America\u2019s energy independence and fossil fuel exports. His industry policy is lower energy costs and less regulation to attract more onshoring.\n\nTrump\u2019s tech policy is unclear. He flip-flopped on the banning of TikTok. He is courting the Silicon Valley titans, who are turning Maga in the hope of less tax on capital and no more regulation. Trump\u2019s main beef with big tech is that it restricts free speech (his speech) on social media. Vance is a fan of support for little tech in opposition to big tech, and this appeals to his venture capitalist backers.\n\nThe Trump mantra of \u2018no more wars\u2019 appeals to an electorate exhausted by the blood and treasure expended in Afghanistan and Iraq. It is likely he will follow through on solving Ukraine in one day (by effectively abandoning it), he is encouraging Israel to \u2018finish the job\u2019 in Gaza as soon as possible (that is, not on his watch) and the signal to China on Taiwan is very mixed. However, many Republicans are ardent supporters of Taiwan and its right to exist. This could put a brake on Trump sacrificing Taiwan on the altar of a grand bargain with China on trade.\n\nTrump is ahead now but we saw over the weekend how quickly things can change. As they used to say on World Championship Wrestling, anything can happen \u2013 and probably will.",

        "text": "Shifting from Biden to Harris, Democrats reset the race. But scholars see risks.\nIt is a moment of extraordinary significance in U.S. political history: Joe Biden, 81 years old and seemingly frail, is stepping away from his campaign less than four months before the election. He has endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, 59, who would be the first Black, Asian-American woman ever to lead the nation. Democrats have quickly rallied behind her.\n\nScholars at UC Berkeley are unanimous that the election has been transformed, and that the Democrats\u2019 change of candidates will have vast, but unpredictable, implications for the campaign. The impact could play out not just in the horse race with Donald Trump and GOP vice presidential candidate J.D. Vance, but in the courts, in simmering cultural tensions over race relations and gender roles, in efforts to engage young voters and in the health of U.S. democracy.\n\nIn the hours after Biden\u2019s announcement, some of Berkeley\u2019s top political scholars offered their analysis and insights.\n\nBerkeley News: What effect will Biden\u2019s decision to drop out have on the presidential race?\n\nEric Schickler\n\nBiden\u2019s decision transforms the election. There is little question that he was significantly behind former President Trump, and the prospects for making up that ground were dim once the debate greatly exacerbated preexisting concerns about the president\u2019s age.\n\nDemocrats have had a serious enthusiasm problem looking ahead to November. Biden\u2019s departure gives an opening for the party to nominate a candidate who is better positioned to mobilize those with unfavorable views of both the current and former president.\n\nBiden\u2019s decision will also reverberate in the race to win Congress. Every Democratic candidate for Congress was going to face ongoing questions about the president\u2019s ability to serve a second term. This takes those questions off the table, allowing Democratic candidates to focus on what Donald Trump and a GOP Congress would do if they are elected in November.\n\nBiden\u2019s endorsement of Vice President Harris makes it more likely that the party quickly unifies behind her. I would be surprised if one of the top potential Democratic candidates for 2028 decides to challenge the vice president at this late date in the calendar.\n\n\u2014 Eric Schickler, political scientist and co-director of the UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies\n\nSome people have suggested that a change of candidates at this point could fully reset the race. Is that possible? Or are people so locked into their camps that this change will make no difference?\n\nHenry Brady\n\nI believe that many Americans will feel a tremendous sense of relief in the next few days. For those committed to President Biden, they will be inspired by seeing that he has recognized his limitations and decided to enable a renewal of the Democratic Party by dropping out.\n\nFor those who are independents or who lean toward the Republican Party and who are uncertain about Donald Trump, especially after his meandering, sometimes incoherent and grievance-filled acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention, there will be the hope that the Democrats nominate an energetic, thoughtful, youthful and capable candidate who can put forth a positive program.\n\nFor those who are die-hard Donald Trump supporters, there will be the usual presumption of his infallibility and invincibility, so not much will change there. But for undecided voters and supporters of Joe Biden, there will be a sense that there is now the possibility that America will have a real choice \u2014 not just between a candidate who often sounds unhinged and a candidate who seems too old for the job.\n\nPresident Biden deserves our praise for his willingness to step aside and to allow America to get beyond the present impasse, and I suspect that his decision will fill the sails of the nation and lead to a campaign that will focus on issues and democracy instead of fears and recriminations.\n\n\u2014 Henry Brady, former dean of the UC Berkeley Goldman School of Public Policy, former president of the American Political Science Association\n\nWhat are the opportunities here for the Democratic Party and its candidates? What are the risks?\n\nLisa Garcia Bedolla Photo courtesy of Lisa Garc\u00eda Bedolla\n\nPresident Biden\u2019s historic decision to leave the presidential race opens up an opportunity for the Democratic Party: the chance to reengage weak partisans and no party preference voters.\n\nWe often forget that who decides U.S. presidential elections is, in fact, those who choose not to vote. The 2020 presidential election had the highest turnout since 1900, yet one-third of eligible voters stayed home. Our political punditry is caught up in a polarized partisan world, ignoring that many Americans are simply disengaged from, and disenchanted by, that world.\n\nThis moment gives the Democrats the chance to shift the narrative and give those disaffected eligible voters a reason to support Vice President Harris. What those voters want is a candidate who is willing to address the big issues that Americans are facing today: inflation, the lack of affordable housing and a growing sense that their communities are unsafe.\n\nWhat they don\u2019t want is a slick marketing campaign, with a candidate who parses every word and who is overly positive about how things are going, particularly regarding the economy. Americans are still suffering from a profound post-COVID sense of social dislocation. They want a president who understands that and has concrete plans for addressing it.\n\n\u2014 Lisa Garc\u00eda Bedolla, political scientist, vice provost for graduate studies and dean of the Graduate Division\n\nThe Democrats thus far seem to be coming together quickly behind Vice President Kamala Harris to replace Biden at the top of the ticket. Given that she is a Black, Asian-American woman, how do you think race, ethnicity and gender issues might play out in the campaign between now and election day in November?\n\nDavid C. Wilson Brittany Hosea-Small for UC Berkeley\n\nThe ascendance of Vice President Kamala Harris to the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee will likely raise a number of both legitimate and offending questions and activate stereotypes that distract from the importance of the moment.\n\nNaturally, people will see Harris as a Black woman \u201cwith Asian heritage,\u201d a liberal Californian and someone who might not have earned the powerful position she now holds, believing that Biden \u201cgave\u201d her the opportunity. The media and public should focus instead on her merits as San Francisco district attorney, California attorney general, U.S. senator and White House cabinet member. She has more political experience than former President Donald Trump and vice-presidential nominee J.D. Vance combined.\n\nAlready, many pundits are using narratives proposing that \u201cAmerica is not ready for a Black woman\u201d (or \u201cwoman\u201d) president. This may be true, as many Americans hold stereotypes that women are weak and passive leaders. In addition, recent comments from both male and female athletes and entertainers have proposed that a woman\u2019s place is in the home as a wife or caregiver, as opposed to a working professional or public leader.\n\nIn terms of race, Harris is a graduate of Howard University, a historically Black institution, and a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority, which brings some credibility among African American voters. Her lighter complexion and Asian background, combined with her role as a legal prosecutor, also raise questions of authenticity among some Black voters. When you are the first of a particular demographic to do something, you are almost always burdened with the handicap of explaining why.\n\nThus, for white males, the average task is to promote your merits and explain away your faults, but for women and racial-ethnic minorities, the task is to get people to see your merits and not see your group identity as a fault.\n\n\u2014 David C. Wilson, dean of the Goldman School of Public Policy and author of Racial Resentment in the Political Mind (University of Chicago Press, 2022)\n\nDoes a change of candidate create conditions in which the Democrats will be better able to go on the offense against a president and vice president who would seem to be vulnerable?\n\nM. Steven Fish\n\nAmericans are hungry for a real leader who makes us feel great about our country and her ability to steer it to still greater heights, not yet another politician who reads issue polls in the morning and spends the rest of the day telling us what she thinks we want to hear on this or that \u201ckitchen table issue.\u201d\n\nTo maximize her chances in November, Kamala Harris must move past the Biden campaign\u2019s banalities about controlling prescription drug prices and \u201cgrowing the economy from the middle out.\u201d The vice president\u2019s task is to show herself to be stronger, firmer in her convictions, more committed to the law and the defense of democracy and more patriotic than Trump.\n\nIt was heartening to see her step out on her first day as nominee-presumptive with a hardcore message that casts herself as a tough-minded prosecutor of abused women and predatory banks. That contrasts with Trump, the felonious abuser of women and servant of the plutocracy.\n\nProjecting exuberance and boundless optimism about the nation\u2019s promise will also be key to seizing the flag from MAGA\u2019s ethnonational nativists and reaching swing voters. Many of those who know Harris personally say she\u2019s got the right stuff. Now\u2019s the time to bring it \u2014 and bring it hard.\n\n\u2014 M. Steven Fish, political scientist, author of \u201cComeback: Routing Trumpism, Reclaiming the Nation, and Restoring Democracy\u2019s Edge (Rivertowns Books, May 2024)\n\nIn effect, Biden\u2019s decision means that the Democrats must throw out the results of the primary elections earlier this year, but a new structure for nominating a candidate has not emerged. How are the Democrats going to manage this?\n\nDan Schnur\n\nThe biggest question going forward is whether the Democrats want an open and competitive nomination process, or one that appears to be open \u2014 but isn\u2019t.\n\nThose who are confident in Harris\u2019 ability to beat Trump want to have this set up for her without looking like a coronation. But Democrats who are worried about her ability to win in November are looking for ways to set up a legitimate contest that would allow the most well-prepared and skilled candidate to emerge as the nominee. That might be Harris, or it might not. But the point would be for her to prove herself, rather than having the nomination handed to her.\n\nHarris and her team are already working furiously to nail down enough support to discourage any opponents from stepping forward. We\u2019ll see in the next few days whether she can pull that off or not. But the outcome will be a direct result in the level of confidence that party leaders have in Harris, or whether she still has some convincing to do.\n\n\u2014 Dan Schnur, veteran Republican political strategist, lecturer at the UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies\n\nTo what extent will the change of candidates \u2013 and the process used to make the change \u2014 face legal challenges from Republicans or others? How viable are those challenges likely to be?\n\nEmily Rong Zhang\n\nA legal challenge to Biden\u2019s withdrawal is very unlikely to succeed.\n\nGenerally, the doctrine in this area gives political parties a great deal of latitude to conduct their internal affairs, including who they select as their presidential candidate. Political parties are ultimately private entities, even if their actions have immense public implications.\n\nThis is not to say that there are no limits on their actions. For instance, they are not allowed to racially discriminate in the candidate selection process. But it is very unlikely that a court will find that such limits have been breached in this case.\n\n\u2014 Emily Rong Zhang, assistant professor of law, specializing in election law\n\nThe change of candidates will almost certainly reflect a broad generational change in the leadership \u2014 and perhaps the orientation \u2014 of the Democratic Party. What are the implications of having a younger candidate?\n\nJake Grumbach\n\nElected officials in the U.S. are the oldest of any democracy. In recent years, some politicians\u2019 decisions to remain in office at very old ages have had large effects on political representation. Joe Biden, in voluntarily ending his presidential campaign, has therefore done something relatively rare in American politics.\n\nKamala Harris, at age 59, is about the age of the average member of Congress. While older than leaders of most other countries, Harris is significantly younger than Donald Trump and other recent presidential contenders. This could be electorally advantageous, as American voters consistently tell pollsters that they would prefer younger politicians.\n\nThis story also speaks to how political parties work. Parties are meant to take a bunch of people \u2014 voters, politicians, policy activists and others \u2014 and make them into a (somewhat) cooperative team. One of the most important collective decisions that parties in the U.S. have to make is to nominate a competitive presidential candidate.\n\nMembers of the Democratic Party worried that Biden was not an especially competitive candidate in 2024, so they made a coordinated push to replace him. Both this push, and the relatively seamless transition to Harris as presumptive nominee, show signs of a functioning political party that is able to coordinate and compromise around finding a solution that might benefit the whole party.\n\n\u2014 Jake Grumbach, associate professor at the Goldman School of Public Policy\n\nCould this change of candidates, and the almost certain emergence of a younger candidate from a new generation, increase turnout among young voters this November?\n\nSarah Swanbeck Brandon S\u00e1nchez Mejia/UC Berkeley\n\nA younger candidate entering the race could energize the base and inject new enthusiasm for younger voters who have grown weary of politics-as-usual.\n\nWhether this translates to a large surge in youth voter turnout in November may come down to whether the new Democratic nominee also can convince young voters of a credible plan to address the existential threats they see in their everyday lives \u2014 a concrete plan to address climate change, clear ideas for how to shore up our democratic institutions, and an economic policy agenda that will improve social mobility and convince younger generations that the American Dream is still within their reach.\n\n\u2014Sarah Swanbeck, executive director of the Berkeley Institute for Young Americans",

        "text": "2024 US election: Republicans pushed to rethink campaign strategy after Biden's withdrawal\nDonald Trump at an election rally at Van Andel Arena, Grand Rapids, Michigan, July 20, 2024. ANNA MONEYMAKER / AFP\n\nThe Democratic camp had increasingly called on US President Joe Biden to withdraw from the presidential race over the past few weeks, but the outgoing president unwittingly found unexpected allies in the inner circle of his Republican opponent, Donald Trump. Four days before the solemn announcement of Biden's withdrawal, on Sunday, July 21, the head of Trump's campaign team, Chris LaCivita, denounced an \"attempted coup\" against the White House occupant on the sidelines of the inaugural convention in Milwaukee.\n\nAnd with good reason. The June 27 debate, a disaster for Biden, had enabled the former president to appear, on the contrary, in full possession of his bearings, even before his spectacular reaction after an assassination attempt against him on July 13. During this debate, the contrast with the exchange that pitted the two men against each other during the 2020 campaign was striking. Four years ago, during a single confrontation between them, Trump deployed irrelevant aggressiveness. After a particularly laborious speech by the Democrat on the issue of immigration, Trump settled for a cruel observation: \"I really don't know what he said at the end of that sentence. I don't think he knows what he said either,\" he jabbed.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, marked by the incumbent president's difficulty demonstrating his ability to campaign with the necessary energy, Trump maintained an unusual reserve. Democratic divisions over the legitimacy of Biden's candidacy did his job for him.\n\nRead more From denial to withdrawal: The three weeks that led Joe Biden to pull out of the race for the White House\n\nOn Sunday, the Republican candidate refrained from hailing Biden's historic decision, even though it marked the end of an exceptionally long political career. Mitt Romney, Republican senator from Utah and one of the last vestiges of the Grand Old Party before its total takeover by Trump, was one of the few in his camp to greet him warmly.\n\nTrue to his style and rhetoric, Trump declared on his Truth Social account: \"Crooked Joe was not fit to run. [...] and is certainly not fit to serve \u2013 And never was,\" he posted, a week after briefly appealing for unity in the country, in the wake of the attack on him.\n\nLikely to mobilize minorities\n\nThis line of attack was scrupulously repeated by other Republican officials in the hours that followed. \"If Joe Biden is not fit to run for president, he is not fit to serve as president. He must resign the office immediately. November 5 cannot arrive soon enough,\" said Mike Johnson, Republican speaker of the House of Representatives. In the coming days, the Grand Old Party is expected to step up its accusations against the Democratic Party, which it claims has concealed the reality of the outgoing president's state of health.\n\nYou have 60.99% of this article left to read.

        "text": "How Kamala Harris's run for the US presidency has reignited old racist and sexist tropes\nFour years ago, when Kamala Harris became US President Joe Biden's running mate, she also became \"the most derided woman\" in US politics, according to a misinformation study.\n\nThe analysis identified Ms Harris, a black and south Asian woman, as a lightning rod for misogyny and racism. On Monday after Mr Biden endorsed her to lead the Democrats, it only took minutes for deeply offensive false narratives about her to resurface.\n\nABC NEWS Verify has been tracking how old tropes, falsehoods, and misinformation are already being weaponised against the current frontrunner for the Democratic nomination.\n\nOur analysis also provides a preview of how grim the political discourse may yet become.\n\nKamala Harris, the 'diversity hire'\n\nJoe Biden endorsed Kamala Harris to lead the Democrats for the 2024 US presidential election after he decided to quit the contest on Monday. (Reuters: Tom Brenner)\n\nFew three-letter acronyms ignite controversy like DEI, which stands for diversity, equity, and inclusion.\n\nThe term is a basic corporate framework about embracing all aspects of social identity (including race, sex, age, sexual orientation, physical disabilities, and socio-economic class) and promoting fair treatment and equal opportunities.\n\nA Pew Research Center survey from last year showed a majority of US workers believed DEI was a \"good thing\", with only 16 per cent labelling it as a \"bad thing\".\n\nBut the term has become a racist dog whistle and the bogeyman of the far-right.\n\nThe term DEI in relation to Ms Harris on X (formerly Twitter) received renewed interest in the hours after Mr Biden's endorsement. Many among the flurry of posts suggested that Ms Harris was only chosen for her ethnicity and gender.\n\nAn example of an X post linking Kamala Harris with DEI, from an account with millions of followers. (Supplied)\n\nFormer Trump aide Sebastian Gorka \u2014 who has previously called the vice-president \"coloured\" and a \"DEI hire\" \u2014 was cut off during an interview on conservative British news channel GB News after questioning her history with \"unkind language\".\n\n\"This woman, this disaster whose only qualification is having a vagina and the right skin colour\u2026\" Dr Gorka began before being interrupted by the host Mark Dolan, who reminded him that Ms Harris was an \"accomplished lawyer\" and an experienced politician.\n\nWashington-based disinformation expert Nina Jankowicz said the dismissal of Ms Harris as the \"DEI candidate\" was also a feature of the last presidential election campaign.\n\n\"It's a pretty well-worn way that we talk about women in positions of power; [that] they couldn't have gotten there on their own.\n\n\"They're [Republicans] going to claim they're [Democrats] running this woman because they have to be bound by diversity, equity and inclusion.\"\n\nNina Jankowicz knew well-worn racist and sexist tropes would resurface after the endorsement. (Supplied: The Wilson Center)\n\nMs Jankowicz, CEO of the disinformation-countering American Sunlight Project, was the lead author of the 2021 study that identified Ms Harris as the focus of online abuse of female politicians.\n\nThe analysis of online conversations about 13 female politicians in a two-month period just before the 2020 election, found that three-quarters of abusive content shared targeted the then-California senator.\n\n\"When I saw the endorsement [of Ms Harris] from President Biden I was expecting this kind of disinformation.\"\n\nMs Jankowicz was briefly the executive director of the Department of Homeland Security's Disinformation Governance Board before it was disbanded.\n\nThe big unknown facing Harris as she eyes a fight against Trump Photo shows A woman with dark hair smiling and a man with blond hair and pursed lips Never before has a major US political party switched horses midstream this close to a presidential election. There are so many unknowns.\n\nPart of what has fuelled these DEI narratives was a comment made by Mr Biden in 2020 during a debate, where he pledged to pick a woman to be his vice-president.\n\n\"There are a number of women who are qualified to be president tomorrow. I would pick a woman to be my vice-president,\" he said at the time.\n\nBeyond the racist implications that a woman of colour is presumed to be less qualified for a position, the term DEI has become a scapegoat for almost every kind of grievance.\n\nIt's been blamed for everything \u2014 cost-of-living, poor box-office performances, aviation safety, the bridge collapse in Baltimore and last week's CrowdStrike global outage.\n\nThe omnipresent George Soros conspiracy theory\n\nIt didn't take long for another narrative to enter the fray, this one xenophobic in nature and boosted by the billionaire owner of social media platform X, Elon Musk.\n\nElon Musk posted on X implying that the son of billionaire philanthropist George Soros was pulling the strings of the Democratic Party. (Supplied)\n\n\"I'd just like to thank @AlexanderSoros for not keeping everyone in suspense about who the next puppet would be,\" Mr Musk posted in response to the news that Open Society Foundation chair Alexander Soros had endorsed Ms Harris.\n\nMr Soros is the son of billionaire philanthropist and former currency speculator George Soros, a Jewish-Hungarian man who escaped the Holocaust and eventually immigrated to the United States.\n\nThe elder Mr Soros, who handed control of his foundation to his son last year, has long been the subject of conspiracy theories alleging control of various organisations and political movements for decades.\n\nBut these allegations are rooted in centuries-old anti-Semitic tropes which claim Jewish people secretly control the world.\n\nWho is Kamala Harris? Photo shows Kamala gestures at a podium. With US President Joe Biden announcing he will not stand for re-election in November, Kamala Harris is seen as a potential successor. But who is she?\n\nABC NEWS Verify has already seen this baseless theory boosted by a prominent right-leaning X account with millions of followers which we have chosen not to name.\n\nAs it spills over into the broader internet and possibly shows up in your feed, it pays to remember it is little more than recycled racism.\n\nWhile Mr Soros is a prolific donor to progressive causes, there is little evidence to suggest he is able to influence global affairs any more than other billionaires, including Mr Musk, who has endorsed Republican former president Donald Trump.\n\nIt also underscores a crucial difference between this year's presidential election campaign and the one four years ago. Mr Musk bought X in 2022 and rapidly dismantled its capacity to detect and moderate harmful content, potentially exposing a candidate like Ms Harris to worse levels of online abuse.\n\nOn top of this, Mr Musk is using his own account, with its swollen ranks of followers, to spread xenophobic conspiracy theories.\n\n'Birtherism' returns\n\nKamala Harris is the frontrunner for the Democrats. (Reuters: Octavio Jones )\n\nFalsehoods about Ms Harris's eligibility to run for president have also resurfaced, with many claiming she cannot hold office because she is not a \"natural born citizen\".\n\nThe claims rely on a persistent but debunked misreading of the US constitution that suggests that because Ms Harris's parents were born overseas she did not meet this criteria. However, she was born in California and based on US law, is a \"natural born citizen\".\n\nThis fringe conspiracy is known as \"birtherism\" and was popularised by Trump during former president Barack Obama's presidency. The false claim was so prevalent during the Obama years that his office was forced to produce a birth certificate. Many \u2014 including Trump \u2014 then suggested it was a forgery.\n\nKamala Harris is the daughter of an Indian American mother and Jamaican American father. (Supplied: Kamala Harris campaign )\n\nThe same racist claims that stalked Mr Obama have also latched onto Ms Harris.\n\nIn August 2020, when she was announced as Mr Biden's running mate, then-president Trump questioned her eligibility.\n\n\"I just heard it today that she [Kamala Harris] doesn't meet the requirements \u2026 I have no idea if that's right,\" he said during a press conference.\n\nOn Monday, three hours after Mr Biden announced he would not be contesting the election, a post on X that repeated the false claims about Ms Harris's eligibility had been viewed more than 4.6 million times.\n\nAs the daughter of migrants, Ms Harris's mixed heritage has also been a focus of some conspiracy theorists and critics of her ties to black culture.\n\nLoading...\n\nBorn to a Jamaican father and an Indian mother, Ms Harris was the first female vice-president and the first of Black and Asian heritage, and has described childhood experiences of structural racism including involvement in black rights activism while at college.\n\n\"I'm black, and I'm proud of being black,\" she said during an interview for her 2020 run.\n\nHowever, in the hours following Mr Biden stepping down, several social media posts criticised her statements about her heritage.\n\nPopular social media posts claimed she was \"only 25 per cent black\" and therefore could not represent black culture.\n\nThe vice-president's mixed heritage would be used to attack her, Ms Jankowicz said.\n\n\"She's \u2026 black and south Asian, so there's a lot going against her.\"\n\nThe disinformation researcher said it was important to \"pre-bunk\" the expected racist and false narratives early.\n\n\"This is an election where it's more important than ever to think about the merits of candidates and their actual track records rather than these childish debased attacks that we've seen so often in politics.\"",

        "text": "AFT votes to endorse Kamala Harris for president\nThe AFT has officially endorsed Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee for president. Delegates from across the nation overwhelmingly voted during a special order of business on Monday, roaring their approval to ratify a resolution passed unanimously by the union\u2019s executive council the night before. The AFT is the first union to endorse Harris.\n\nThe AFT has long championed the Biden-Harris administration for its support of workers, families, unions and democracy, and supporting Harris is an enthusiastic renewal of that commitment. Union leaders lined up at microphones to express their support, noting Harris\u2019 powerful leadership skills, her embrace of accessible healthcare and her commitment to public education and public services, among other attributes they are sure will win her the presidential election.\n\nThe resolution notes both Biden\u2019s accomplishments as \u201cone of the most consequential and meaningful presidents in our history\u201d and his full support and endorsement of his vice president \u201cto continue to move America forward, unite the party, and defeat Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nThe resolution also enumerates Harris\u2019 impressive record and strength as a candidate. From taking the lead in the administration\u2019s fight to restore reproductive freedom, to chairing the White House Task Force on Worker Organizing and Empowerment, she has led the fight for freedom to vote, worked hard to cap the cost of insulin and lower prescription drug costs, and worked to pass the first real gun safety law in decades. The resolution notes Harris\u2019 decadeslong career as a prosecutor, attorney general of California, senator and vice president, and her record of upholding gun safety laws, protecting clean air and water and advocating for survivors of domestic violence.\n\nAs president of the United States, Harris would stand in stark contrast to the Republican candidate, the resolution states. Whereas Harris has championed public schools, investing in mental wellness, career and technical education and community schools, Trump and his secretary of education, Betsy DeVos, \u201csought to demonize, defund and destabilize\u201d public education. Harris fights for the middle class and as vice president enabled increased wages and economic growth, 15 million new jobs and the lowest unemployment in 50 years; under Trump, the nation lost nearly 3 million jobs, and he cut taxes for the rich and increased them for the middle class.\n\nThe Biden-Harris administration made healthcare more accessible by strengthening the Affordable Care Act and negotiated lower prices for prescription drugs; Trump supports Big Pharma and tried to eliminate the ACA.\n\nAs AFT President Randi Weingarten said in her State of the Union speech, this election will be a choice between two value systems. And when this moment is recorded in history books, it will record a people united, mobilized and ready to vote for a better future.\n\n[Virginia Myers, photo by Suzannah Hoover]",

Both Republicans and Democrats know the stakes here, as the state has seen more political ads than any other this cycle.\n\nShapiro is 51, fairly popular, and the first-term governor delivered a sizable victory in 2022. He trounced his Republican competitor by nearly 15 percentage points.\n\nThe Trump campaign has put a lot of time and money into campaigning in Pennsylvania, knowing it has to pull out one of the bricks from Democrats\u2019 so-called Blue Wall states of Pennsylvania, Michigan or Wisconsin. To this point, Trump has had a narrow polling advantage in the state.\n\nBut, while Shapiro may be a household name in his state, he, like many others on this list, is not well known nationally. So, while he has a reputation as a competent governor and former state attorney general, his broader appeal is a question mark.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear\n\ntoggle caption Jon Cherry/Getty Images for Concordia\n\nBeshear is part of a small club within the party of Democratic governors who lead ruby-red states.\n\nHe\u2019s also maintained popularity and has gained a reputation as someone who works well with both parties. Beshear had a 52% approval rating, with only 29% disapproving, according to an April Morning Consult poll. That\u2019s notable popularity, given Biden received much lower marks in the state.\n\nIf Harris, 59, picks Beshear, 46, it would be the youngest Democratic presidential ticket since former President Bill Clinton and former Vice President Al Gore ran more than 30 years ago. Their combined age is only three years older than the 2012 Republican ticket of Mitt Romney and former Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan.\n\nLike Shapiro, Beshear is also not known on the national stage. And he does not come from a swing state.\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper\n\ntoggle caption Allison Joyce/Getty Images/Getty Images North America\n\nCooper pulled himself out of consideration on July 29, announcing on social media that it \"just wasn't the right time for North Carolina and for me to potentially be on a national ticket.\"\n\nDemocrats are hoping to flip North Carolina this fall. In 2020, Biden lost the state by less than 2 percentage points, and having Cooper, 67, on the ticket, Democrats hope, could help make up that difference and deliver a much-needed 15 electoral votes.\n\nHarris has been a frequent visitor to the Tar Heel state throughout Biden\u2019s term. Her trip to Fayetteville, N.C., last week marked her 15th stop there since taking office and her seventh this year, according to the White House. On many of those trips, she\u2019s appeared alongside Cooper.\n\nHarris and Cooper have also known each other for more than a decade, first working together when Cooper was state attorney general, and Harris served in the same role in California. Cooper is term-limited as governor and will be leaving office at the end of the year.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nFor Cooper, his biggest obstacles are a lack of national name recognition, his age and that North Carolina is seen as a political reach for Democrats this year.\n\nTransportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg\n\ntoggle caption Kent Nishimura/Getty Images\n\nButtigieg\u2019s 2020 presidential bid makes him a more recognizable face on the campaign trail. As a member of the Biden administration and a former mayor of a small city in Indiana, he could speak to the White House\u2019s record and also potentially appeal to Midwest voters.\n\nHe\u2019s also seen as one of the Democratic Party\u2019s best messengers, willing to debate seemingly anyone on any outlet, including Fox News. He\u2019s acquitted himself well in those settings and during congressional hearings, defending the Biden administration\u2019s policies and the president himself.\n\nThe 42-year-old cabinet official would join Republican Vice Presidential nominee J.D. Vance as the second Millennial on a presidential ticket. Buttigieg and Harris would also be the youngest ticket for Democrats in three decades.\n\nButtigieg is the first openly gay man to hold a cabinet position. And he would be the first to appear on a major party ticket. Even with his prominent position in the Biden Cabinet and his 2020 campaign run, still about half of Americans don\u2019t have an opinion on him, according to a recent Ipsos survey.\n\nArizona Sen. Mark Kelly\n\ntoggle caption Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nKelly, 60, represents another key swing state in the presidential race. The 60-year-old is a former astronaut and the husband of former Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who was seriously injured in a mass shooting in 2011 and has proven to be a strong fundraiser for Democrats.\n\nKelly has joined Giffords as a loud voice on gun violence prevention. Harris has also made tackling gun violence a priority throughout her time as vice president. Kelly could also help blunt the GOP message on immigration, given he\u2019s from a border state and has put some separation between himself and Biden on border policy.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nHe and Giffords also recently penned an op-ed about their struggle to have a child together and revealed that she was undergoing IVF treatments during the time she was shot. Women\u2019s reproductive rights are also a major issue in this campaign.\n\nKelly\u2019s seat isn\u2019t up until 2028, but if Kelly were to join Harris on the ticket \u2013 and they win, it would certainly create a competitive race. While Kelly cuts a good profile, he\u2019s also untested nationally.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom\n\ntoggle caption Jeff Chiu/AP\n\nNewsom, 56, is one of the most recognizable governors in the country. He\u2019s long been a rumored 2028 presidential contender and has been a key Biden ally throughout this campaign.\n\nHe is also seen as one of the Democratic Party\u2019s best messengers with a facility for facts and numbers that stands as a stark contrast to President Biden. He gained a degree of notoriety for sitting for hour-long interviews with Fox News\u2019s Sean Hannity and then debating Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on the conservative cable outlet.\n\nThe California governor has, though, longstanding political baggage dating back early in his career. And if he ran with Harris, they would be an all-California ticket, which could draw ire from the right and present a constitutional hurdle.\n\nIllinois Gov. JB Pritzker\n\ntoggle caption Brian Cassella/Chicago Tribune/Tribune News Service via Getty Images\n\nPritzker is a 59-year-old progressive billionaire who has been a vocal supporter of Biden and often goes on the offensive against Trump.\n\nDespite his wealth, he has a blue-collar appeal, and he\u2019s from the Midwest, which could help with those key Blue Wall states.\n\nBut he hails from another blue state, so he may not offer much additional electoral pull for Harris \u2013 and he\u2019s not well known.\n\n\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz\n\ntoggle caption Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n\nWalz has emerged as a surprisingly serious VP contender. He isn\u2019t necessarily from a state considered a swing state since Republicans haven\u2019t won Minnesota in a presidential election for 52 years.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBut it was close in 2016, less than 2 points, and he could potentially have appeal in the Upper Midwest beyond Minnesota, where Democrats need to win.\n\nHis biggest contribution to the ticket could be his appeal to \u201cnormal\u201d and a Harris validator. A clip of an interview of him attacking Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, in which he crisply describes them and their policies as \u201cweird,\u201d has been viewed 4.7 million times as of Sunday afternoon. He also does about as good a job as any Democrat in defending Democratic governance.\n\nIn addition to being the governor of Minnesota, the 60-year-old, who grew up in rural Nebraska, is also the head of the Democratic Governors Association and a decorated Army veteran.\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer\n\ntoggle caption Bill Pugliano/Getty Images\n\nWhitmer, 52, has been a rising star in the Democratic Party since she won the governor\u2019s race in 2019. She was on the shortlist of names for Biden\u2019s potential VP pick in 2020 and served as a co-chair of Biden\u2019s reelection campaign.\n\nAnd, of course, her state of Michigan will be crucial for Democrats to win. But there has never been an all-female presidential ticket, which could present a hurdle, though it would stand as a stark contrast to the all-white-male Trump-Vance ticket.\n\n",

Joe Biden, after announcing his exit, endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to be the Democrats' new presidential candidate. President Joe Biden drops out of presidential race. (AP)\n\nJoe Biden's decision to drop out of the presidential race came after his poor debate performance against Donald Trump, and the Republican Party taking repeated jibed at him for his \u201cinability\u201d to complete another term as the president. The debate debacle also many Democrat lawmakers urging Joe Biden to withdraw as the presidential candidate.\n\nWhat happened in the hours before Joe Biden dropped out?\n\nThe first person to receive a call from Joe Biden exiting from his reelection bid was Vice President Kamala Harris on Sunday, reported The Washington Post. Joe Biden also held one-to-one meetings with White House chief of staff Jeff Zients, and his campaign chair Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon.\n\nZients called for a meeting of Joe Biden's campaign staff and White House staff for 1:45pm, so that the US president could brief them over his decision. The chief of staff made a formal announcement regarding the same to the entire White House staff at around 2:30pm on Sunday.\n\nBiden took the decision over the weekend through multiple huddles with White House counselor Steve Ricchetti, senior campaign adviser Mike Donilon, deputy chief of staff Annie Tomasini and senior adviser to the first lady Anthony Bernal, all of whom were at the president's vacation house, The Washington Post reported.\n\nWhy did Joe Biden end reelection bid?\n\nThe calls for Joe Biden to drop out as the US presidential face grew after his debate debacle against Donald Trump on June 27. While the US president blamed his performance on jet lag and international travel, the rank and file in the Democrat Party urged him to drop out of the race.\n\nOpposition to Biden's continued campaign from within his party gained steam over the past week with 36 congressional Democrats - more than one in eight - publicly calling on him to drop out, driven by concerns over his mental acuity, reported Reuters.\n\nLawmakers from the ruling party expressed discontent with Biden continuing on his reelection bid, saying that they feared that the US president, if elected again, could cost them not only the White House but also the chance to control either chamber of Congress next year.\n\nSources told news agency Reuters that Biden had a \u201clast minute change of heart\u201d, and up until Saturday night, had no intention to drop out of the race. The US president only changed his mind on Sunday afternoon, after multiple meetings with his top advisors.",

        "text": "Nebraska push for winner-take-all will wait in line after property tax relief \u2022 Nebraska Examiner\nLINCOLN \u2014 Nebraska Republicans who want to change how the state awards its Electoral College votes before the presidential election this fall will have to wait a little longer.\n\nGov. Jim Pillen\u2019s office confirmed Monday that his written call for this week\u2019s special session will focus on property taxes alone and won\u2019t include winner-take-all.\n\nPillen spokeswoman Laura Strimple said the governor has not shut the door on perhaps calling a special session later this year to consider awarding all five of Nebraska\u2019s electoral votes to the winner of the presidential popular vote statewide. This year that likely would be former President Donald Trump in this Republican-dominated state.\n\nState Sen. Lou Ann Linehan of Omaha told Nebraska Public Media on Monday the tax session could last until Labor Day. If so, that would push a winner-take-all special session into September.\n\nPillen attended GOP convention\n\nThe governor visited the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee on Thursday, the same day Trump spoke. The Trump campaign has made clear that it wants the law changed.\n\nTrump himself called at least one Nebraska state lawmaker last session when the measure was being discussed, the senator told several of his colleagues, although the Trump campaign denied the call being made.\n\nPillen has said Nebraska should not stand alone with Maine in awarding a single vote for the winner in each congressional district, with the rest going to the statewide winner.\n\nThe Nebraska Republican Party has tried for decades to change a 1991 law passed under Democratic Gov. Ben Nelson that allowed one slice of a GOP-leaning state to stay competitive.\n\n2nd District remains closely split\n\nThe Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District, despite the 2020 redistricting that swapped parts of suburban Sarpy County for rural Saunders County, remains politically divided.\n\nIn the last four presidential elections, Democratic and GOP candidates have each won the 2nd District twice. Democrats won a vote in 2008 and 2020. Republicans won in 2012 and 2016.\n\nPillen has told the Examiner he would call a special session on winner-take-all this summer if legislative leaders tell him they have the votes. Thus far, they do not.\n\nState Sen. Loren Lippincott of Central City, who sponsored last year\u2019s winner-take-all proposal, Legislative Bill 764, said Monday he remains short of the 33 votes needed to overcome a promised filibuster.\n\nSeveral local political observers have said the holdouts could face tremendous pressure from Trump and his campaign supporters as the election nears. Some expect senators to flip.\n\nTime for 2024 changes running out\n\nTime is short. The first early ballots get mailed to overseas Nebraskans at least 45 days before the election, in September, and the first early ballots sent to Nebraska addresses are mailed in October.\n\nPart of the reason for the national attention is because of the possibility of the election ending in a 269-269 tie. In that scenario, a single stray electoral vote could matter.\n\nSpeaker of the Legislature John Arch did not immediately return messages seeking comment about winner-take-all discussions in the conservative-led, officially nonpartisan body.\n\nIf Nebraska acts, state lawmakers in Democratic-leaning Maine have said they would consider changing to winner-take-all to avoid handing any one candidate an unfair advantage.\n\nNebraska Democratic Party chair Jane Kleeb has said Republicans are trying to change the rules too close to an election. She has said Trump should compete for 2nd District votes.\n\nBoth major party presidential campaigns have built a presence in the 2nd District in recent months, hiring staff and working with volunteers and U.S. House candidates to knock on doors.",

When Barack Obama was restricted to two terms, many Democrats wanted the former first lady of the US to throw her hat in the ring. With US President Joe Biden having announced his exit from the 2024 White House race, Michelle Obama\u2019s name is doing the rounds again as the only one who can defeat Donald Trump read more\n\nFormer US President Barack Obama listens as former first lady Michelle Obama speaks during the unveiling of their official White House portraits, in the East Room of the White House, in Washington, US, September, 7, 2022. File Image/Reuters\n\nMichelle Obama\u2019s popularity within Democratic circles and beyond is undeniable. As the spouse of former United States President Barack Obama, she left a lasting impression during her tenure as First Lady of the US, championing various social causes and maintaining a high public profile.\n\nWith the political landscape in the United States having undergone a seismic shift following US President Joe Biden\u2019s decision to withdraw from the 2024 US presidential race. The development has sparked widespread speculation and debate about potential replacements, with Michelle Obama\u2019s name frequently mentioned as a top contender.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer potential candidacy has stirred considerable excitement and concern among different political factions.\n\nWhat are Michelle Obama\u2019s chances?\n\nA recent Ipsos poll revealed that Michelle Obama is the only hypothetical candidate who could decisively defeat Donald Trump in a head-to-head match-up. The poll showed her leading Trump with 50 per cent to his 39 per cent, while other candidates, including Vice President Kamala Harris, showed a much narrower margin or even a slight deficit against Trump.\n\nThen US Democratic presidential candidate Senator Barack Obama (D-IL) (far L), his wife Michelle (2nd L), vice presidential running mate Senator Joe Biden (D-DE) (far R) and his wife Jill (2nd R) stand together at a campaign event at the Old State Capitol in Springfield, Illinois, August 23, 2008. File Image/Reuters\n\nAdditionally, a survey by The Center Square Voters\u2019 Voice in collaboration with Noble Predictive Insights indicated that 24 per cent of Democrat-leaning likely voters preferred Michelle Obama over other candidates, with Kamala Harris trailing significantly at 7 per cent.\n\nAre Republicans \u2018scared\u2019?\n\nRepublican figures have also taken notice of Michelle Obama\u2019s potential candidacy. US Senator Kevin Cramer told New York magazine that \u201cMichelle Obama would probably be the one person that could step in and keep the party united and probably provide a little bit of a moving start because of her obvious notoriety.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: Why Joe Biden\u2019s decision to drop out is not necessarily good news for Donald Trump\n\nFormer GOP contender Vivek Ramaswamy echoed this sentiment, predicting that neither Joe Biden nor Kamala Harris would secure the Democratic nomination and leaving open the possibility for Michelle Obama to step in.\n\nWhat has Michelle Obama said?\n\nDespite the widespread speculation, Michelle Obama has consistently stated her disinterest in running for office.\n\nFormer US First Lady Michelle Obama attends a groundbreaking ceremony for the Obama presidential center in Jackson Park, in Chicago, Illinois, US, September 28, 2021. File Image/Reuters\n\nIn a Netflix special with Oprah Winfrey, she said, \u201cPolitics is hard. And the people who get into it\u2026 you\u2019ve got to want it. It\u2019s got to be in your soul, because it is so important. It is not in my soul.\u201d Earlier this year, her office reaffirmed this stance to NBC News, clarifying that she had no plans to run for office in 2024.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHas Barack Obama said anything?\n\nFormer US President Barack Obama\u2019s comments have added fuel to the speculation. While praising Joe and Jill Biden, he notably refrained from endorsing Kamala Harris, saying, \u201cFor now, Michelle and I just want to express our love and gratitude to Joe and Jill for leading us so ably and courageously during these perilous times \u2014 and for their commitment to the ideals of freedom and equality that this country was founded on.\u201d\n\nAlso Read | Joe Biden exits, Kamala Harris top contender: Is America ready to vote a woman into the White House?\n\nThe phrase \u201cfor now\u201d has led some to believe that an endorsement for another candidate, possibly Michelle Obama, might be forthcoming.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat does the public want?\n\nThe internet has been abuzz with discussions about Michelle Obama\u2019s potential candidacy. Social media platforms, especially X, have seen a surge in posts advocating for her to run.\n\nOne user wrote, \u201cPlease focus on Michelle Obama. Kamala will get thrown under the bus. She is the sacrificial lamb. At the convention, it will be Michelle. Please focus on her statements/behaviour for examination. We will not have enough time once she\u2019s selected.\u201d\n\nUS First lady Jill Biden, left, and second gentleman Douglass Emhoff, right, watch as US President Joe Biden, center left, raises the hand of Vice President Kamala Harris as they view the Independence Day firework display over the National Mall from the balcony of the White House, July 4, 2024, in Washington. File Image/AP\n\nPolitical analysts and commentators have weighed in on the situation. Some believe that Michelle Obama is the Democrats\u2019 best shot at defeating Donald Trump, given her high favorability and public appeal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDawn Staley, a women\u2019s basketball legend and head coach at the University of South Carolina, even made a public appeal to Barack Obama on X: \u201cNow please let us borrow @MichelleObama for just 4 short years! First Gentleman is a good look for you.\u201d\n\nIf he isn\u2019t the coolest man on earth\u2026..@BarackObama thank you for your inspiration and leadership still. Now please let us borrow @MichelleObama for just 4 short years! First Gentleman is a good look for you! \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70 pic.twitter.com/2DpBAAQJU2 \u2014 dawnstaley (@dawnstaley) July 11, 2024\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBiden\u2019s endorsement of Kamala Harris as the Democratic Party\u2019s new nominee has not quelled the speculation about Michelle Obama.\n\nThe Democratic Party now faces a critical decision. While Kamala Harris is the potential official nominee, the lingering question remains whether Michelle Obama might be a better choice to unite the party and present a formidable challenge to Donald Trump.\n\nAlso Read: Obama to Pelosi, US Democrats who haven\u2019t endorsed Kamala Harris, yet\n\nWith the Democratic National Convention approaching, which reportedly begins on August 19, there is still time for a shift in strategy, potentially leading to a surprise nomination.\n\nWith inputs from agencies",

One day earlier, the AFL-CIO Executive Council, where the APWU is represented by President Mark Dimondstein, voted unanimously to endorse Kamala Harris for U.S. President.\n\nThese votes and endorsements came on the heels of the changed circumstances in the presidential campaign, with President Joe Biden declaring he is no longer a candidate in the upcoming 2024 election.\n\nThe APWU National Executive Board vote also reflects the guidance and direction of the APWU National Convention where 2000 delegates, just last week and prior to Biden\u2019s withdrawal, overwhelmingly voted to endorse the Biden-Harris ticket.\n\nThe National Executive Board recognizes and respects that our members reflect many different political affiliations and viewpoints. The Executive Board does not dictate how our members vote.\n\nThe National Executive Board does encourage our members and their families, regardless of political affiliation, to vote based on the issues that uplift and promote a better life for postal workers and all working people.\n\n\u201cThe outcome of this presidential election will have a huge impact on postal workers and the choice in this election is stark,\u201d declared National President Mark Dimondstein. \u201cEither we elect Donald Trump who plans to destroy the public Postal Service, our jobs and union, further undermine workers\u2019 rights, women\u2019s rights and voting rights, and send us on a path to dictatorship, or elect Kamala Harris who has proven as Vice President and in prior political office, to have demonstrated support for postal issues and some genuine advocacy for workers\u2019 rights, women\u2019s rights, unions, respect for all people and common decency.\u201d\n\nThe APWU will continue to share with the membership issue-based assessments of the 2024 presidential and congressional candidates and encourage our members to be fully engaged in the upcoming and vitally important presidential election as we work together to expand our democratic rights and protect our jobs, our union and the public Postal Service.",

        "text": "Harris slams Trump in first US presidential campaign rally\nUS vice president makes campaign debut in Wisconsin after securing backing of key Democrats and record fundraising.\n\nKamala Harris has reiterated that she is ready to take on Donald Trump in the United States presidential election, as the likely Democratic nominee held her first official campaign rally in her push for the White House.\n\nSpeaking to a crowd in the battleground state of Wisconsin on Tuesday afternoon, the US vice president pledged to unite the Democratic Party \u201cso that we are ready to win in November\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe have 105 days until Election Day and in that time, we have some work to do. But we\u2019re not afraid of hard work,\u201d Harris said. \u201cAnd we will win this election.\u201d\n\nThe rally in Milwaukee comes two days after President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 election race following weeks of questions about his age and fitness to serve another term in office.\n\nWhile the US vice president has not officially been confirmed as the Democratic Party\u2019s presidential nominee, The Associated Press news agency reported on Monday evening that Harris had secured enough votes from delegates to secure the nomination.\n\nHarris\u2019s candidacy has reinvigorated a US election campaign that had failed to captivate many voters frustrated by a choice between Biden and former President Trump, as well as by the state of the economy, American foreign policy and other issues.\n\nTonight, I am proud to have earned the support needed to become our party\u2019s nominee. Over the next few months, I'll be traveling across the country talking to Americans about everything on the line. I fully intend to unite our party and our nation, and defeat Donald Trump. pic.twitter.com/Bsq3N6pMAi \u2014 Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) July 23, 2024\n\nSince Biden\u2019s decision on Sunday to forgo his re-election bid, Harris has garnered the backing of influential Democrats, including former House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Governors Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Gavin Newsom of California.\n\nThe top Democrats in the US House of Representatives and the US Senate, Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer, also threw their support behind Harris\u2019s candidacy on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cDemocrats are moving forward stronger and more united than ever before,\u201d Schumer told reporters.\n\nHarris\u2019s campaign also said it had collected more than $100m in contributions from Sunday afternoon to Monday evening, with 62 percent of all donations coming from first-time donors.\n\nReporting from the White House on Tuesday morning, Al Jazeera\u2019s Kimberly Halkett said Harris\u2019s candidacy has injected \u201cenormous\u201d excitement into the Democratic presidential race.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen is just record-breaking fundraising,\u201d said Halkett, adding that tens of thousands of people also have signed up to work on the vice president\u2019s campaign.\n\nHalkett explained that Harris\u2019s team is concentrating on four key US states \u2013 Nevada, Arizona, Georgia and Pennsylvania \u2013 as well as on younger voters of colour across the country as she prepares to face Trump, the Republican candidate, in November.\n\nWisconsin, which is where the Republican Party held its national convention last week, is also expected to be critical in the race for the White House.\n\n\u201cThere are independents and young people who did not like their choices, and Harris has a chance to win them,\u201d Paul Kendrick, executive director of the Democratic group Rust Belt Rising, told the Reuters news agency.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump and his vice-presidential running mate, Senator JD Vance, have been lambasting Harris, with the former US president attacking her record and dubbing her \u201cLyin\u2019 Kamala\u201d on his Truth Social platform.\n\n\u201cLyin\u2019 Kamala Harris destroys everything she touches!\u201d he wrote on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nRepublicans also have tried to blame Harris for the high number of migrants and asylum seekers crossing the US-Mexico border during Biden\u2019s term in office \u2013 a key election issue \u2013 and called her the administration\u2019s \u201cborder czar\u201d.\n\nBut experts have slammed that criticism as false and noted that Harris is not in charge of US border policies. Biden tasked her in 2021 with addressing the \u201croot causes\u201d of migration to the US from Central America.\n\nFor her part, Harris has hit back at Trump and stressed some of the key issues she plans to campaign on, namely access to reproductive healthcare, economic opportunity and a defence of democratic institutions.\n\n\u201cWe are running a people-powered campaign,\u201d she said during Tuesday afternoon\u2019s rally in Milwaukee. \u201cAnd because we are a people-powered campaign, that is how you know we will be a people-first presidency.\u201d\n\nEchoing a speech she made to campaign staff and volunteers in Delaware a day earlier, Harris said US voters face a choice in November between \u201ctwo different visions\u201d for the country: \u201cone where we are focused on the future; the other focused on the past\u201d.\n\nShe said building up the middle class would be a \u201cdefining goal\u201d of her presidency and pledged to give all Americans the chance \u201cnot just to get by, but to get ahead\u201d.\n\nThe former California attorney general also reiterated that her history of prosecuting \u201cpredators\u201d, \u201cfraudsters\u201d and \u201ccheaters\u201d would serve her well in the campaign.\n\n\u201cHear me when I say, I know Donald Trump\u2019s type,\u201d she said on Tuesday. \u201cAnd in this campaign, I promise you I will proudly put my record against his any day of the week.\u201d\n\nTrump has been convicted of falsifying business records, found civilly liable for sexually abusing a magazine columnist and indicted in two criminal cases related to efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nHe has rejected any wrongdoing and said he is the victim of a politically motivated \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d.",

        "text": "Four Takeaways on Electoral Conditions Ahead of Venezuela\u2019s 2024 Presidential Election\nAs Venezuela gears up for presidential elections on July 28, the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA) invited two experts to discuss the electoral conditions that may define the outcome. Eugenio Mart\u00ednez, director of Votoscopio, and Griselda Colina, director general of the Global Observatory on Communication and Democracy (Observatorio Global de Comunicaci\u00f3n y Democracia) shared timely insights and concerns about the election process in Venezuela.\n\nAlthough the government and the opposition Unitary Platform had signed the Barbados Agreement on Electoral Conditions in October of last year, this election is not taking place under free and fair conditions. Venezuela\u2019s authoritarian government has banned candidates and imposed restrictions that raise serious concerns about the fairness of the electoral process. Nonetheless, the opposition and civil society remain committed to mobilizing in hopes of ushering in a democratic transition.\n\nHere are the main takeaways from our conversation:\n\n1. Electoral Observation\n\nAs Eugenio Mart\u00ednez explained, the transparency of the electoral process rests on three pillars: the work of the poll watchers, international and national observers, and members of each \u201ctable\u201d or voting station.\n\nTraditionally, national observers have played an important role since they have the capacity to deploy a larger mission throughout the territory, and have expert knowledge of the electoral procedure and dynamics at the local level. For this electoral process, the Observatorio Venezolano Electoral (OEV) was not accredited by the National Electoral Council to participate as an observer. The Red de Observaci\u00f3n Electoral Asamblea de Educaci\u00f3n (ROAE) received credentials to access voting sites. Some 600 credentials\u2014fewer than what ROAE had requested\u2014were finally delivered last week. There are other three groups that have received credentials and Griselda Colina explained that there is little information about their trajectory as observers: Centro de Estudios Superiores, Proyecto Social, Asociaci\u00f3n Venezolana de Juristas.\n\nWithout formal accreditation but rather in their role as civil society, a coalition of civil society organizations named Red Electoral Ciudadana will carry out independent activities of contextual observation with a human rights perspective. Other organizations will be monitoring restrictions and human rights violations.\n\nThe access of international observation has likewise been limited, with the UN Panel of Electoral Experts and the Carter Center among the only technical observers that received invitations. The Maduro government revoked its invitation to the European Union Electoral Observation Mission this May, citing sanctions applied by its member states. On Monday, Minister of Defense Vladimir Padrino welcomed observers from the Carter Center in Caracas.\n\nAs Venezuela approaches elections, new missions have been announced from Colombia and Brazil. \u201cMore than observation missions, it\u2019s political accompaniment,\u201d according to Mart\u00ednez. They could contribute to the oversight of the transparency of the process, but they are not technical missions. The only two technical international observation missions are the Carter Center and the UN Panel of Electoral Experts.\n\n2. Other Electoral Conditions\n\nAs Eugenio Mart\u00ednez noted, \u201cThe [automated voting] system has been audited, the system will function\u2026 The problem lies in the environment surrounding the voting process.\u201d Meaning, the electronic voting system is secure, but there are other irregularities that undermine the transparency of the process and that could become more acute on the day of the elections. For example, coercion of voters in places controlled by the government, extending the hours in which the polling stations are open, limiting the access of poll watchers and observers, among others.\n\nPoll watchers (testigos) are also crucial to avoid irregularities and to guarantee the scrutiny of the process. They are representatives of the presidential candidates that are present at each voting center, as a guarantee of the transparency of the process. The CNE changed the rules of the game to require that poll watchers be voters at the center in which they perform their role as witnesses of the process, something unprecedented. Despite this new limitation, the opposition was able to request accreditation of at least one poll watcher from the opposition in 98 percent of the 30,026 polling stations nationwide. However, up until the moment of this interview, the CNE had not granted them credentials to be able to conduct their work. The expectation is that those credentials will be issued throughout this week.\n\n3. The International Community\u2019s Role\n\nThe international community\u2019s role in backing Venezuelans\u2019 desire for a competitive election will be very relevant, both during and after the election. President of Brazil Luis In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva has been among the most vocal actors in recent days, going as far as dispatching one of his top foreign policy advisors to Venezuela ahead of the vote. Similarly, Iniciativa Democr\u00e1tica de Espa\u00f1a y las Am\u00e9ricas (IDEA) headed by Mexico\u2019s Vicente Fox and other conservative political veterans have announced their wish to attend the election, but it is not clear whether they will be granted access to the country.\n\nThe international community\u2019s reaction to the election results, be it favorable to Maduro or to the opposition, will help color successive negotiations. Should the Maduro government recognize its defeat, negotiations will need to establish conditions for a transfer of power by January 2025. If the Maduro government claims victory despite evidence of irregularities or otherwise disregards the results, international actors are likely to issue a resounding condemnation of the election.\n\n4. Election Results and What Comes Next\n\nAccording to our invited experts, regardless of the official results, the election will likely trigger a complex negotiation process. Eugenio Mart\u00ednez suggests that Venezuela might face a scenario in which the results are not published immediately on the night of July 28. With institutions under the control of the ruling party until the start of the next presidential term in January 2025, the country\u2019s governability remains uncertain.\n\nColina offered another possible panorama in which the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) might accept defeat in the face of a landslide opposition victory. In this scenario, party machinery would turn to preserving its political viability at local and state levels ahead of the upcoming 2025 regional and parliamentary elections. This strategy would depend on party officials\u2019 cost-benefit calculations regarding their long-term political survival.\n\nVenezuelans\u2019 commitment to the right to vote and have autonomy over their destiny calls for international support in the defense of their political rights. Subsequent negotiations, either mediated by Norway or other actors, should aim to re-institutionalize the country, restore the rule of law, and ensure respect for human rights.\n\nFor more information don\u2019t miss our video playlist featuring the latest updates on the Venezuelan elections by our Director for Venezuela, Laura Dib.",

Prominent Democratic elected officials, party leaders and political organizations quickly lined up behind Harris in the day after Biden\u2019s exit from the race and her campaign set a new 24-hour record for presidential donations on Monday.\n\nSeveral state delegations met late Monday to confirm their support for Harris, including Texas and her home state of California. By Monday night, Harris had the support of well more than the 1,976 delegates she\u2019ll need to win on a first ballot, according to the AP tally. No other candidate was named by a delegate contacted by the AP.\n\nCalifornia state Democratic Chairman Rusty Hicks said 75% to 80% of the state\u2019s delegation were on a call Tuesday and they unanimously supported Harris.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve not heard anyone mentioning or calling for any other candidate,\u201d Hicks said. \u201cTonight\u2019s vote was a momentous one.\u201d\n\nStill, the AP is not calling Harris the new presumptive nominee. That\u2019s because the convention delegates are still free to vote for the candidate of their choice at the convention in August or if Democrats go through with a virtual roll call ahead of that gathering in Chicago.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris speaks from the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, Monday, July 22, 2024, during an event with NCAA college athletes.

She promised to \u201cunite our Democratic Party, to unite our nation, and to win this election.\u201d\n\nShe quickly leaned into the themes that will be prominent in her campaign against Trump over the coming 100 days, contrasting her time as a prosecutor with Trump\u2019s felony convictions \u2014 \u201cI know Donald Trump\u2019s type,\u201d she said \u2014 and casting herself as a defender of economic opportunity and abortion access.\n\n\u201cOur fight for the future is also a fight for freedoms,\u201d she said. \u201cThe baton is in our hands.\u201d\n\nThe president called into the meeting from his home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, where he is recovering from COVID-19, to lend his support to Harris. He planned to talk about his decision to step aside in an address to the nation later this week.\n\n\u201cThe name has changed at the top of the ticket, but the mission hasn\u2019t changed at all,\u201d Biden said in his first public remarks since announcing his decision to step aside, promising he was \u201cnot going anywhere\u201d and plans to campaign on Harris\u2019 behalf.\n\nBiden said of his decision, \u201cIt was the right thing to do.\u201d\n\nAs he handed off the mantle of leadership to Harris, Biden added: \u201cI\u2019m watching you kid.

The event in Milwaukee will be her first full-fledged campaign event since announcing her candidacy.\n\nThe AP tally is based on interviews with individual delegates, public statements from state parties, many of which have announced that their delegations are supporting Harris en masse, and public statements and endorsements from individual delegates.\n\nLocking up the nomination was only the first item on the staggering political to-do list for Harris after learning of Biden\u2019s plans to leave the race Sunday morning on a call with the president. She must also pick a running mate and pivot a massive political operation that had been built to reelect Biden to boost her candidacy instead.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, Biden\u2019s campaign formally changed its name to Harris for President, reflecting that she is inheriting his political operation of more than 1,000 staffers and war chest that stood at nearly $96 million at the end of June. She added $81 million to that total in the first 24 hours after Biden\u2019s endorsement, her campaign said \u2014 a presidential fundraising record \u2014 with contributions from more than 888,000 donors.\n\nThe campaign also saw a surge of interest after Harris took over, with more than 28,000 new volunteers registered since the announcement \u2014 a rate more than 100 times an average day from the previous Biden reelection campaign, underscoring the enthusiasm behind Harris.\n\nBig-name Harris endorsements Monday, including from Govs. Wes Moore of Maryland, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, J.B. Pritzker of Illinois and Andy Beshear of Kentucky, left a vanishing list of potential rivals.\n\nHouse Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, who had been one of the notable holdouts, initially encouraging a primary to strengthen the eventual nominee, said she was lending her \u201centhusiastic support\u201d to Harris\u2019 effort to lead the party.\n\nHarris, if elected, would be the first woman and first person of South Asian descent to be president.\n\nThe Democratic National Convention is scheduled to be held Aug. 19-22 in Chicago, but the party had announced before Biden dropped out that it would hold a virtual roll call to formally nominate Biden before in-person proceedings begin. The convention\u2019s rules committee is scheduled to meet this week to finalize its nomination process with a virtual vote as soon as Aug. 1, the party announced on Monday, with the process completed by Aug. 7.\n\n\u201cWe can and will be both fast and fair as we execute this nomination,\u201d Jaime Harrison, the Democratic National Committee\u2019s chair, said on a conference call with reporters.\n\nThe party said the virtual roll call would feature multiple rounds of voting on nominees if multiple candidates meet the qualification threshold. To qualify, candidates must have the electronic signatures of 300 convention delegates.\n\n\u2014\n\nAP writers Seung Min Kim and Will Weissert in Washington and Chris Megerian in Wilmington, Delaware, contributed.\n\n___\n\nFollow the AP\u2019s coverage of the 2024 election at https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024.",

But conspiracy theorists, right-wing influencers and even some Republican politicians immediately cast Biden\u2019s resignation from the campaign as evidence of something more sinister.\n\nThe flurry of unverified rumors, speculation, and conspiracy theories comes as people are reeling from an onslaught of high-stakes political upheaval, from the assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump on July 13 to Biden\u2019s withdrawal from the race eight days later.\n\nOn the most extreme end, Charlie Kirk of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA and far-right activist Laura Loomer suggested, without evidence, that Biden may be dying or already dead.\n\nOthers, including billionaire hedge fund boss Bill Ackman, raised doubts over the president\u2019s letter announcing his decision, baselessly suggesting his signature wasn\u2019t really his.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nRepublican politicians including U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado speculated about why Biden had not been seen in public since the announcement. On Tuesday, the president emerged from his beach house in Delaware where he had been isolating while recovering from COVID-19. He plans to address the nation on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cIf this were a hostage situation, that letter would not qualify as proof of life,\u201d Ackman posted on X on Sunday. (On Tuesday, Ackman shared a post with a video of Biden boarding Air Force One that read in part, \u201cPresident Joe Biden seen in public for the first time in nearly a week, debunking conspiracy theories online.\u201d)\n\nStill others on the right framed Biden\u2019s move as not his at all, but an anti-democratic coup orchestrated by shadowy forces including George Soros, a frequent target of conspiracy theories. In doing so, they cast doubt on the legitimacy of Vice President Harris\u2019 candidacy \u2014 and, ultimately, on the election as a whole.\n\n\u201cThe idea of selecting the Democrat[ic] Party's nominee because George Soros and Barack Obama and a couple of elite Democrats got in a smoke-filled room and decided to throw Joe Biden overboard, that is not how it works,\u201d Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance told the crowd at a rally in Ohio on Monday.\n\nHarris is also being targeted with baseless claims and conspiracy theories, including the long-running falsehood that she\u2019s not really an American citizen, despite the fact she was born in Oakland, Calif. These \u201cbirther\u201d smears came up when she ran for president in 2020 and were amplified by Trump, who previously promoted similar false claims about former president Barack Obama.\n\nAfter any breaking news event, people search for answers that may not be available right away. That information void is a ripe environment for the spread of incorrect and incomplete information, as well as for exploitation by those seeking to gain clout or financial reward by amplifying the wildest theories, said Melissa Ryan, CEO of consulting firm CARD Strategies, which tracks disinformation and extremism.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cThe thing to understand is for folks who live in this cinematic universe, things are never what they seem. It's always a false flag,\u201d said Ryan.\n\nWhen Biden called in to an event with Harris and campaign staff on Monday, some online commentators immediately began to speculate that it was not in fact Biden\u2019s voice, but a deepfake created with artificial intelligence.\n\nSome figures on the right had been pressing the narrative, without evidence, that Biden would be replaced on the Democratic ticket at the last minute since at least last fall. Much of that speculation claimed former first lady Michelle Obama or California Gov. Gavin Newsom would be the replacement nominee. Despite the discrepancy in the details, the reality of Biden stepping out has many of them feeling validated.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s shocking how precisely right you can be, right down to the exact timing,\u201d former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, who was among those who had long suggested Biden would drop out, posted on X on Sunday.\n\nThere is little downside to this kind of speculation, which can boost an influencer\u2019s profile whether or not their claims pan out.\n\n\u201cThe truth is, you know, sometimes things change. It doesn't mean that, oh, the conspiracy theorists were right all along. It means everyone was working with the information they knew to be true,\u201d Ryan said.\n\nWhen speculation does line up with reality \u2014 even imperfectly \u2014 that creates opportunity to build trust and expand their audience.\n\n\u201cWe've been seeing that in a lot of different contexts, whether it's in politics or astrology even on the internet, of people trying to say like, \u2018Oh, we knew that this was going to happen,\u2019 and that assigns some sort of authority to your voice,\u201d said Danielle Lee Tomson, research manager at the University of Washington\u2019s Center for an Informed Public.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cLike, \u2018I had inside information or some sort of analytic ability to understand that this was going on. So, you know, you can trust me on this future information that I might help you process or make sense of\u2019,\u201d she said.\n\n",

A day earlier, President Joe Biden bowed out of the contest and endorsed her for the election to the top post. Harris also received \"enthusiastic support\" from former speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi as well as Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts - both powerful Democrat leaders.Biden's endorsement, as well as the paucity of time before the November 5 presidential election, tilted the scales in favour of the Indian-origin vice-president, said experts tracking developments.Harris, as vice-president, met Prime Minister Narendra Modi in September 2021, during his visit to the US, and recently spoke with leader of the opposition Rahul Gandhi.The first woman and first person of colour to hold the US vice-president's post, she is the frontrunner for being named the Democratic Party nominee at its convention, to be held during August 19-22 in Chicago, said experts.Notably, however, Harris is yet to get support from former president Barack Obama In a post on X, she wrote, \"On behalf of the American people, I thank Joe Biden for his extraordinary leadership as President of the United States and for his decades of service to our country. I am honoured to have the President's endorsement and my intention is to earn and win this nomination.\"Democratic National Committee chairman Jaime Harrison issued a statement shortly after Biden dropped out of the race, saying the Democrats would \"undertake a transparent and orderly process to move forward as a united party, with a candidate who can defeat Donald Trump in November.\"A Washington Post article said, \"If a virtual roll call doesn't show a clear majority backing Harris, the party is likely to hold a mini-primary at the convention. The convention may also serve as the venue for the formal announcement of a new vice-presidential nominee.\"The convention is expected to be attended by 50,000 people.Meanwhile, Harris' campaign team kickstarted its preparations, while the Biden-Harris campaign on Sunday formally amended filings with the Federal Election Commission, saying it was renaming its principal committee 'Harris for President,' CNN reported. The name of the committee is \"different than previously reported,\" it said.\"Vice-President Harris is now a candidate for United States President in the 2024 election and will henceforth be conducting campaign activities only in pursuit of that office,\" the principal committee of the Biden-Harris campaign said in a letter filed with the commission.Support for Harris came almost immediately from the Democratic Party brass, as well as those seen as potential rivals for the nomination, such as California Governor Gavin Newsom.The Congressional Black Caucus PAC, Bill and Hillary Clinton, and Democratic Senate candidates, including Andy Kim of New Jersey, Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland and incumbent Senator Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin were among those to rally behind Harris.",

AFL-CIO, Service Employees International Union, the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations have announced their endorsements of Harris' presidential bid . Some notable holdouts remain, suggesting that Harris will still have some work to do to win over other working-class voters .",
        "text": "Labor groups begin to unite behind Harris' campaign \u2014 but some holdouts remain\nThe Summary Vice President Kamala Harris has received a number of endorsements from labor unions as she works to earn the Democratic nomination for president.\n\nThose unions include the AFL-CIO, Service Employees International Union (SEIU), the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) and the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), among others.\n\nStill, there are some holdouts, signaling that Harris and the Democratic Party have work to do to consolidate support.\n\nMany of America's largest labor unions have now announced their endorsements of Kamala Harris' presidential bid, as the vice president intensifies her campaign for the Democratic nomination.\n\nYet some notable union holdouts remain, suggesting Harris will still have some work to do to win over other working-class voters.\n\nOn Monday, the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), the biggest federation of unions in the U.S. and a longtime supporter of President Joe Biden, announced its endorsement of Harris.\n\n\u201cFrom day one, Vice President Kamala Harris has been a true partner in leading the most pro-labor administration in history,\u201d said AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler. \u201cAt every step in her distinguished career in public office, she\u2019s proven herself a principled and tenacious fighter for working people and a visionary leader we can count on. From taking on Wall Street and corporate greed to leading efforts to expand affordable child care and support vulnerable workers, she\u2019s shown time and again that she\u2019s on our side.\u201d\n\nShuler added: \u201cWith Kamala Harris in the White House, together we\u2019ll continue to build on the powerful legacy of the Biden-Harris administration to create good union jobs, grow the labor movement and make our economy work for all of us.\"\n\nSeveral other unions also have announced their support, including the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), the United Food & Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW), the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) in addition to the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and the United Steelworkers (USW).\n\nThe Biden-Harris administration has enjoyed the steady backing of union and labor groups over the past few years and it has sought to reciprocate. In his most high-profile show of support, Biden became the first sitting president to walk a picket line during the United Auto Workers' strike against the Big Three automakers last fall.\n\nBut the UAW is one of the groups that has yet to announce its formal support for Harris' White House bid. On Sunday, it issued a statement praising Biden's leadership during his administration but stopped short of endorsing Harris.\n\n\"The path forward is clear: we will defeat Donald Trump and his billionaire agenda and elect a champion for the working class to the highest office in this country,\" the statement read.\n\nA UAW representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday morning.\n\nRepublican nominee Donald Trump has sought to undermine UAW leadership, explicitly calling for the ouster of its head, Shawn Fain.\n\nDuring his nomination acceptance speech in Milwaukee last week, Trump claimed, without evidence, that China was planning to build auto manufacturing sites in Mexico at the expense of assembly lines in the U.S.\n\n\u201cThe United Auto Workers ought to be ashamed for allowing this to happen and the leader of the United Auto Workers should be fired immediately,\" Trump said, adding: \"Every single autoworker, union and nonunion, should be voting for Donald Trump because we\u2019re going to bring back car manufacturing and we\u2019re going to bring it back fast.\"\n\nThere remain dozens of automotive manufacturing plants in the U.S., many of which are in Southern states and the Midwest.\n\nTrump has also sought to exploit the UAW's concerns about the national transition to electric vehicles \u2014 something that caused the union to decline to explicitly support Biden's 2024 candidacy.\n\n\u201cThe federal government is pouring billions into the electric vehicle transition, with no strings attached and no commitment to workers,\u201d Fain said last spring, according to CNBC. \u201cThe EV transition is at serious risk of becoming a race to the bottom. We want to see national leadership have our back on this before we make any commitments.\u201d\n\nThe UAW has historically seen a steady 60-40 split between Democrat- and Republican-supporting members, according to Brian Rothenberg, a former UAW communications director and now a partner at Triumph Communications firm.\n\nHe said that while UAW members remain uneasy about the EV transition, there are other concerns about workplace safety, and especially the impact of Project 2025, a conservative blueprint that lays out actions to weaken public-sector unions.\n\n\"That's a much more robust issue for them than perhaps for the rest of the country,\" Rothenberg said.\n\nUAW members have attended and participated in Trump events in Michigan, CNBC reported last year.\n\nThis past weekend, Trump and running mate JD Vance appeared at a rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan, to bolster support in the crucial swing state.\n\nWhile UAW leadership has at least formally rejected Trump, another major union player has explicitly signaled its presidential endorsement is up for grabs.\n\nSean O'Brien, the head of the Teamsters Union, gave an impassioned speech against corporate interests at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee last week that caused some commentators to question whether labor is now as fully united behind Democrats as they have traditionally been.\n\n\"I refuse to keep doing the same things my predecessors did,\" O'Brien said. \"Today, the Teamsters are here to say we aren\u2019t beholden to anyone or any party. We will create an agenda and work with a bipartisan coalition ready to accomplish something real for the American worker. I don\u2019t care about getting criticized. It\u2019s an honor to be the first Teamster in our 121-year history to address the Republican National Convention.\"\n\nA since-deleted post on X from the official Teamsters account in the wake of the speech appeared to signal internal rancor about O'Brien's appearance.\n\n\u201cUnions gain nothing from endorsing the racist, misogynistic, and anti-trans politics of the far right, no matter how much people like Sen. Hawley attempt to tether such bigotry to a cynical pro-labor message,\u201d the Teamsters account wrote on X, referring to the Republican senator from Missouri, Josh Hawley, then adding: \u201cYou don\u2019t unite a diverse working class by scoffing at its diversity.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, a Teamsters representative said the group has invited Harris to a roundtable discussion, and noted that its presidential endorsement are traditionally announced after the political parties' conventions.\n\n\"We are on our timeline and continuing to engage our members in this process,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nThe Democrats will host their convention in Chicago next month.\n\nWhile Biden has been generally pro-labor, seeking to increase manufacturing jobs and improve workers' bargaining power by banning noncompete agreements, active union membership has stayed on its historical downtrend during his term.\n\nYet even as Republicans have begun to pursue working-class and factory workers more aggressively, there is currently an effort underway to dismantle the National Labor Relations Board, the government body in charge of settling labor disputes.\n\nThe biggest backer of that initiative is Elon Musk, the head of Tesla, who has pledged his full support to Trump.\n\nMusk, who earned praise from Trump at the Michigan rally, was sanctioned by the NLRB for tweeting in 2018: \u201cNothing stopping Tesla team at our car plant from voting union ... But why pay union dues & give up stock options for nothing?\u201d\n\nMore recently, Tesla became the subject of an NLRB complaint in May that accused the company of discouraging its employees \"from forming, joining, or assisting the Union or engaging in other concerted activities.\" An initial hearing in that dispute is scheduled for this month.\n\nA Tesla representative could not be reached for comment.",

        "text": "Poll: Presidential race hits a reset with Harris vs. Trump\nPoll: Presidential race hits a reset with Harris vs. Trump\n\ntoggle caption Kamil Krzaczynski/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe 2024 presidential campaign has hit a reset with more voters moving into the undecided camp now that Kamala Harris is potentially the Democratic nominee, a new NPR/PBS News/Marist poll finds.\n\nHarris and former President Donald Trump are statistically tied, but 1 in 5 independents, including almost 3 in 10 independent women, now say they are undecided. So these next few weeks will be vital for Harris to reintroduce herself before views solidify.\n\nThe survey also found that Democrats are feeling better about their chances now, and Black voters, in particular, say they are more fired up to vote.\n\nBut both Harris and Trump have work to do with key voting groups, from younger and nonwhite voters for Trump; and independents, suburban and white voters overall for Harris.\n\nAs for Biden\u2019s decision to step aside in the presidential race, Americans overwhelmingly agree with his choice, and two-thirds think he should serve out his term in office and not resign.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nLoading...\n\nHarris and Trump are statistically tied\n\nIn a head-to-head matchup, Trump gets 46%, while Harris is at 45%, with 9% undecided. In Marist\u2019s survey earlier this month, just 2% were undecided between Trump and Biden. The poll of 1,309 adults was conducted Monday via online research panels. It has a +/- 3.2 percentage point margin of error, meaning results could be roughly 3 points higher or lower.\n\nIn a five-way contest, Trump and Harris each get 42%, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. pulls in 7%, the lowest since Marist has been testing him since April, and independent Cornel West and the Green Party\u2019s Jill Stein get just 1%.\n\nNotably, Harris holds onto Gen Z/Millennial voters and nonwhite voters more so than Biden was able to when the contest moves from a head-to-head with Trump to one with third-party choices. Earlier this month, Biden declined 13 points with those younger voters and 10 points with nonwhite voters. Harris, on the other hand, largely retains her support with those groups.\n\nSignificant numbers of various groups have now moved into the undecided category\n\nWith more folks undecided, there's an opportunity for Harris that Biden did not seem to have. It's another key indication of just how much of a restart this move is for the campaign.\n\nLoading...\n\nDemocrats overwhelmingly want Harris to be the nominee\n\nBy a 77%-22% margin, Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say they want her to be the nominee.\n\nBlack voters were the most likely of any subgroup to say they were more likely to vote now that Biden has stepped aside \u2013 50% said so. Latinos (46%) and voters aged 18-29 (43%) were also among the most likely to say they are more likely to vote now.\n\nAmericans agree Biden made the right choice in not running for reelection, but most think he should finish out his presidency\n\n87% said stepping aside was the right thing to do, including 87% of Democrats and Republicans, as well as 90% of independents.\n\nTwo-thirds (68%) think Biden should finish out his term. Republicans are largely split, with 53% saying he should resign and 47% saying he should serve out his term.\n\nA plurality said the decision puts Democrats in a better position to win\n\nBy a 41%-24% margin, Americans said Biden\u2019s decision increases Democrats\u2019 chances this fall. A third said it makes no difference.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nTwo-thirds of Democrats (65%) said it increases their chances. More independents also think so, 38%, vs. 21% who think it doesn\u2019t. A plurality of Republicans (42%) think it won\u2019t make a difference, and more of them believe it will hurt rather than help (36%-21%).\n\nHarris starts with a net-negative favorability rating, but slightly better than Trump\n\nHarris gets a 40%-44% positive-to-negative rating, while 15% either haven\u2019t heard of her or were unsure. Trump gets a 43%-49% rating with 8% unsure.\n\n\n\nIn the last Marist survey, Biden\u2019s unfavorable rating was 7 points worse than Harris.\n\nTrump may be seeing a marginal convention bounce, as his unfavorability rating is 4 points lower than Marist\u2019s survey taken before the convention.\n\nBlack voters have among the highest favorability ratings of Harris of any group \u2013 61%. White evangelical Christians (73%) and men without college degrees (62%) give Trump among his highest ratings. Those numbers show which voters likely make up the strongest portions of each candidate\u2019s base of support.\n\nThis is a critical period for Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, Trump\u2019s VP pick, because lots of people haven\u2019t formed an opinion of him yet\n\nForty-one percent have either never heard of him or are unsure. Just 28% have a favorable opinion, while 31% have a negative one.\n\nThere\u2019s no consensus about a vice-presidential pick, because they are largely unknown\n\nTwenty-one percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents would like to see Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, and another 21% favor Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg as a VP pick. They\u2019re followed by Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (17%), Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly (13%), North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper (8%), Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker (7%), Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear (6%) and Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (6%).\n\nColored by partisanship, Biden\u2019s presidential legacy is not seen as a positive one\n\nHalf of those surveyed say Biden will be remembered as either below average or one of the worst presidents in history (31% said one of the worst, 19% said below average). A quarter said average, another quarter said above average or one of the best presidents.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThere are very different views by party, though, with 85% of Republicans and 57% of independents saying Biden would be seen as below average or one of the worst, while 55% of Democrats saying above average or one of the best.\n\nFor context, when Trump left office, larger numbers \u2013 60% \u2013 said he would go down as below average or one of the worst. In 2016, 40% of respondents said former President Barack Obama would be seen as one of the best or above average, compared to 31% who said below average or one of the worst.\n\nDigging into the numbers, Harris has work to do among independents, suburban voters and white voters\n\nHarris only pulls in 32% of independents in a match-up against Trump, while Biden got 46% in Marist\u2019s last survey. She only gets 40% of white voters, compared to Biden\u2019s 47%; and only 42% of small city/suburban women, compared to 58% for Biden.\n\nTrump now leads with suburban voters, 50%-42%, when Biden had led previously, 56%-42%.\n\nBut Harris has an opportunity to convince these voters, as 1-in-5 independents (21%) are now undecided, compared to just 4% previously; 11% of small city/suburban women are also undecided, compared to 2% in the last poll; as are of suburban voters, compared to 2% previously; and 7% of white voters, only 2% of whom said so earlier this month.\n\nTrump, though, sees declines with younger voters, nonwhites and those without degrees",

The Democrats will hold their national convention to pick their presidential nominee in August. Vice-President Kamala Harris is a favorite to replace Biden and is expected to receive the nomination. There might be some opposition to his nomination.President Joe Biden has endorsed Kamala Harris. After the news of Biden\u2019s decision to quit the race, there are questions regarding Harris\u2019s running mate . There are many candidates being considered as Harris\u2019 running mate. Here is the complete list of probable candidates.The Governor of Kentucky has his political acumen which will come handy for the party. The state had overwhelmingly voted for Trump in 2016. It is under these circumstances that Beshear won the election in 2019 by beating a candidate endorsed by Trump.He is presently the Transport Secretary in the Biden administration. He was a mere mayor in the city of South Bend in the state of Indiana. He had put up a good competition against Biden in the party\u2019s primaries in 2020. He is the first individual to become a secretary belonging to the LGBTQIA community. He has openly declared his orientation.The North Carolina Governor won the contest in 2016 and 2020 when the state voted in favor of Trump. Appointing him as Harris\u2019 running mate could help the Democrats win the state under tense circumstances when the party will have to win critical states during the election.Mark Kelly is among the front runners to serve as Harris\u2019 running mate. The Senator from Arizona was earlier even a choice to replace Biden, according to one such surveys.He is presently the Maryland Governor. He was in the news for the handling of the Baltimore bridge collapse. During a recent meeting between the Governors and Biden, he led the meeting.The Governor of California is from the same state as Kamala Harris. He is also a probable candidate to replace Joe Biden. His record in the administration may work against him. The state of California has the challenge of increasing crimes and homelessness.He is a Governor of the critical state of Illinois. He has an estimated net worth of $3.5 billion and could self-finance his campaign. He is expected to host the Democratic Governors in August during the party\u2019s national convention.He serves as the Governor of Pennsylvania. Like Kamala Harris, he served as an Attorney. The state is one of the swing states and appointing him as a running mate may help the party win a critical swing state.She is the Governor of Michigan and also serves as the co-chair of the Biden-Harris campaign. She is also one of the candidates to replace Joe Biden. Her credentials are strong and she could emerge as the running mate of Kamala Harris.The former president has not endorsed any candidate after joe Biden quit the race. Many have called on Michelle Obama to replace Joe Biden on the ballot box.She remains the favorite among all the Democrats to replace Joe Biden on the ballot box. There may be opposition to her candidature from some quarters.",

        "text": "What pushed President Biden to withdraw from the reelection race?\nPressure from his own party to step aside grew despite White House assurances.\n\nJust two days after announcing he was prepared to return to the campaign trail, President Joe Biden announced Sunday that he is dropping out of the race, taking members of his staff by surprise.\n\n\"It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President,\" Biden said in his statement. \"And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.\"\n\nBiden's decision to withdraw from the reelection campaign came in the wake of repeated White House statements, and declarations from Biden himself, that he would remain in the race and was confident that he could defeat former President Donald Trump's reelection bid. Yet those assurances did little to decrease the public pressure from an increasing number of his fellow Democrats for Biden to move aside in favor of a stronger candidate.\n\nSome 48 hours after Biden, who is recovering from COVID-19, said he would return to the stump this week, the pressure from those in his own party for him to withdraw from the race continued to mount.\n\nNot only did the list of Democratic congressional members echoing the call for Biden to withdraw grow to at least 40, staunch Biden supporters like Sen. Joe Manchin, I-W.Va., upped their public calls for the 81-year-old president to end his presidential campaign.\n\nJust before Biden announced that he was stepping aside and endorsing his vice president, Kamala Harris, to lead his party's ticket, Manchin went on ABC's \"This Week\" and encouraged Biden \"to pass the torch to a new generation.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden pauses as he speaks at a news conference on the final day of the NATO summit in Washington, DC, July 11, 2024. Jacquelyn Martin/AP\n\n\"He will go down with a legacy unlike many people, as one of the finest and truly a [patriotic] American,\" Manchin said. \"So, with that, I come with a heavy heart to think the time has come for him to pass the torch to a new generation.\"\n\nBiden's decision came just eight days after Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer visited Biden in his Rehoboth, Delaware, beach home and had a heart-to-heart talk with Biden about leaving the race, sources told ABC News Chief Washington correspondent Jon Karl.\n\nSources further told ABC News that Biden's own staff didn't know Biden was stepping down until just one minute before he publicly announced his decision on Sunday, leaving some members of the president's staff blindsided by the decision.\n\nIn the end, first lady Jill Biden played a supportive role but left it up to the president to make the ultimate call, her communications director, Elizabeth Alexander, told ABC News.\n\n\u201cDown to the last hours of the decision only he could make, she was supportive of whatever road he chose,\" Alexander said. \"She\u2019s his biggest believer, champion, and always on his side, in that trusted way only a spouse of almost 50 years can be.\"\n\nVice President Harris did not say in a statement she released Sunday when she learned Biden was stepping aside, focusing instead on praising Biden's leadership.\n\nPresident Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris join hands in the air after watching the fireworks on the National Mall from the White House balcony, July 4, 2024, in Washington. Samuel Corum/Getty Images\n\n\"On behalf of the American people, I thank Joe Biden for his extraordinary leadership as president of the United States and for his decades of service to our country,\" Harris said. \"His remarkable legacy of accomplishment is unmatched in modern American history, surpassing the legacy of many presidents who have served two terms in office.\"\n\nIn a letter to the nation, Biden didn't elaborate on what thinking may have prompted his decision, saying only \"And while it has been my intention to see reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.\"\n\nBiden's statement also said he would speak later this week to the nation about his decision, which came came 24 days after his disastrous June debate with former President Donald Trump.\n\nJust two days prior to Sunday's announcement, Biden sounded as if he had no plans to withdraw from the reelection race. In a statement Friday, the president said, \"I look forward to getting back on the campaign trail next week to continue exposing the threat of Donald Trump's Project 2025 agenda while making the case for my own record and the vision that I have for America: one where we save our democracy, protect our rights and freedoms, and create opportunity for everyone.\"\n\nBiden\u2019s youngest brother, Frank Biden, told ABC News that his brother\u2019s subsequent decision to withdraw was a \"close call\" reached only after several Biden family members held several discussions over the past week, led by first lady Jill Biden, and that the family has always been supportive of the president doing whatever he thought best for the country.\n\n\u201cIt really boils down to this: it has to do with his overall health and vitality. Not anything cognitive. But he\u2019s a proud guy, it pisses him off that he shuffles when he walks,\" Frank Biden told ABC News.\n\nFrank Biden also said it has \u201cbeen really horrible [for the family] to see the dogs let loose on him,\u201d referring to longtime allies who in recent weeks joined the calls for Biden to drop out of the race.\n\n\u201cJoe has one thing uppermost in his mind. It\u2019s not him, not his ego, not his ambition. He has really reached a place where the only thing that matters to him is the health of this nation,\" Frank Biden said.\n\nA source close to the Biden family disputed Frank Biden's account of President Biden's decision, saying, \"He hasn\u2019t spoken to his brother in weeks. What he said about health being a factor in the president\u2019s decision is completely untrue.\"",

        "text": "Sure, 2024 has had lots of news \u2013 but compared with 1940, 1968 or 1973, it\u2019s nothing exceptional\nHistory usually happens at a leisurely pace, with major events months or even years apart. But this year, it seems like someone has pushed fast-forward, with significant events coming on a weekly or even daily basis. One company is now selling a T-shirt declaring \u201cTHIS IS MY LIVING IN UNPRECEDENTED TIMES SHIRT.\u201d\n\nThe announcement on July 21, 2024, that Joe Biden would withdraw from the presidential race was the latest in a dizzying series of major domestic events in 2024. Here\u2019s a brief list:\n\nWhile 2024\u2019s fast pace of events is rare in American history, it\u2019s not unique.\n\n1968: Assassinations, political turmoil, war\n\nMany observers have already compared 2024 to 1968. Both years saw incumbent Democratic presidents bow out of the election, as well as tragic outbreaks of political violence. But 1968 also saw a rapid unfolding of other historic events. Here\u2019s what happened that year:\n\n1940: War, US draft and FDR\u2019s historic reelection\n\nTwo other years stand out for the rapid pace of significant events. The first is 1940, which was dominated by Nazi Germany\u2019s invasions of European countries, the response to that aggression and a precedent-setting third term for U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt.\n\n1973: Abortion, peace deal, Watergate, political mayhem\n\nFinally, 1973 also witnessed a rapid sequence of historic events. The federal right to abortion was guaranteed by the U.S. Supreme Court. The Vietnam War ended after almost 60,000 Americans and millions of civilians were killed. War began in the Middle East. And Congressional hearings commenced in a political scandal that would, the next year, end Nixon\u2019s presidency.\n\nWhat do these years of unprecedented events have in common?\n\nOne factor seems to be that wars and presidential elections seem to generate a cascade of events. Second, important events seem to beget more events. In 1940, the Nazi invasions led to Churchill becoming British prime minister and probably boosted the likelihood of Roosevelt running for and winning a third term.\n\nIn 1968, the Tet offensive helped trigger the challenges to President Johnson, which led to his decision to drop out. That helped set the stage for the calamitous Democratic convention that year.\n\nTrump\u2019s political and legal comebacks this year made Democrats even more desperate for a winning nominee, increasing the pressure on Biden after his poor debate performance.\n\nWe don\u2019t know if the pace of news events this year will begin to slow down. What we do know is that most Americans might appreciate a bit of a breather before encountering another potentially historic event.",

Biden has already endorsed his vice president for the nomination, but there's no succession protocol for the presidential ticket in the way there is for the office .",
        "text": "July 22, 2024, presidential campaign news\nPresident Joe Biden will end his bid for reelection and has endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nDespite Biden\u2019s backing, it remains unclear whether Harris will become the nominee, or what process the party will take to select an alternative.\n\nHere are some answers to frequently asked questions:\n\nDoes Harris just become the nominee? No. While Biden has already endorsed his vice president for the nomination, there\u2019s no succession protocol for the presidential ticket in the way there is for the office. Harris will have to win a majority of the convention just like anyone else.\n\nWhat\u2019s the \u201cvirtual roll call\u201d? Democrats are in the process of setting up a system to conduct their presidential nomination vote remotely before the party\u2019s convention next month.\n\nUnder a plan presented Friday, delegates would get 24 hours\u2019 notice before voting begins, and voting would take place via digital ballots emailed to delegates.\n\nHowever, the party did not take any steps to approve the plan at Friday\u2019s meeting. It\u2019s not yet clear whether the party will stick with the remote vote plan or scrap it and allow the formal vote to happen on the convention floor.\n\nHow would other candidates get into the race? Under party rules, candidates must meet certain requirements to have their names placed into nomination to be the party\u2019s presidential candidate.\n\nThey must gather hundreds of signatures from delegates (at least 300, but not more than 600) from several states.\n\nCandidates also must meet a series of requirements laid out in party rules, including that they are a \u201cbona fide Democrat\u201d and that they have \u201cestablished substantial support for their nomination as the Democratic candidate\u201d for president. While this determination is to be made by the DNC chair, the party has not yet released more details on how eligible candidates would be determined.\n\nWhat are delegates? There are two separate sets of delegates.\n\nThere are 3,949 pledged delegates. These are delegates who were selected through various state-level processes. About 99% of them were pledged to vote for Biden, based on his performance in primaries and caucuses around the country. The individuals who were pledged to vote for Biden were also approved by his campaign.\n\nRoughly 750 (747 as of the last word from the DNC \u2013 this number can change) are automatic delegates. Also known as \u201csuperdelegates,\u201d these are individuals who serve as delegates by virtue of another position they hold or held. These delegates are free to vote for the candidate of their choice, but under normal circumstances, they can\u2019t vote on the first ballot if their votes could impact the results of the nomination (it\u2019s not exactly clear whether they\u2019ll be able to participate on this first ballot in this case.\n\nAre Democratic delegates required to vote for the candidate who won them? No. Under Democratic party rules, pledged delegates \u201cshall in all good conscience reflect the sentiments of those who elected them.\u201d However, the candidates\u2019 right of review means that delegates can be expected to be loyal to the candidate to whom they\u2019re pledged.\n\nBut now that Biden is no longer a candidate, his delegates are free to vote for whomever they\u2019d like. He doesn\u2019t need to formally \u201crelease\u201d his delegates.",

        "text": "Harris and Trump are tied, poll finds. Here\u2019s why strategists say that\u2019s good for Democrats\nNearly all Americans \u2013 87 percent \u2013 think President Joe Biden\u2019s decision to end his reelection bid was the right thing to do, according to the latest PBS News/NPR/Marist poll. That view crossed ideological, generational and partisan lines, a strong note of unity in a din of national division.\n\nBiden\u2019s decision increases Democrats\u2019 chances of winning the election, said a plurality (41 percent) of Americans. Those who felt this moment would prove a turning point included 65 percent of Democrats, 38 percent of independents and 21 percent of Republicans.\n\nAt the same time, 24 percent said Biden\u2019s decision to exit decreases Democrats\u2019 odds of winning in November, while 34 percent said his move will make no difference, including 42 percent of Republicans.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the policies of the last four years, he hasn\u2019t missed a beat,\u201d Democratic strategist Adam Parkhomenko said. \u201cBut he\u2019s not as quick as he used to be. Four years is a long time.\u201d\n\nRoughly three-quarters of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said Vice President Kamala Harris should be nominated for the top of their ticket in November. Fewer than a quarter said Democrats should find someone else to lead the party. This poll was conducted Monday, as endorsements, campaign donations and pledged delegates began to stack up in support of Harris taking Biden\u2019s place.\n\nIf the election were held today, 46 percent of voters would back Trump, while 45 percent of U.S. registered voters would support Harris, falling well within the margin of error. Compared to the previous PBS News/NPR/Marist poll, taken this month before Biden left the race, support for both Trump and Harris fell by a few points each, while the percentage of undecided voters grew 8 points.\n\nWhether Harris has the ability to attract voters beyond the Democratic Party \u2013 and overcome middling-to-poor public impressions of Biden\u2019s tenure \u2013 is another question. Right now she\u2019s under water for general perception, this poll found, though a significant number aren\u2019t sure what they think of her.\n\nIn this latest poll, 44 percent of U.S. adults said they viewed Harris unfavorably. At the same time, 40 percent said they regarded her favorably, while 15 percent said they were not sure, including 19 percent of independents.\n\nBiden\u2019s exit is far from the only shock to the American political system in the last two weeks. Former President Donald Trump survived an assassination attempt at a Pennsylvania campaign rally two days before the Republican National Convention, where he told his dramatic experience of being shot and paid tribute to other victims.\n\nWith the GOP coming out of a dramatic and unifying Republican National Convention and Democrats experiencing the \u201ceuphoria\u201d of no longer having Biden running, Republican strategist Whit Ayres said it looks \u201clike the two have canceled each other out. There\u2019s no bump for either\u201d Trump or Harris.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right back to a dead-even race,\u201d Ayres said.\n\nBiden\u2019s decision to leave the 2024 race and his legacy\n\nWithin 24 hours of Biden\u2019s withdrawal and endorsement of Harris, the Democratic Party raised more than $81 million, with a majority of donors saying it was their first time giving during this election cycle, according to a Harris campaign email. By Monday, the Associated Press reported from its own unofficial survey that Harris had secured votes from more than 1,976 delegates, enough to become the Democratic Party\u2019s presumptive nominee (although she has not secured that distinction yet).\n\nWATCH: Harris solidifies Democratic support and is favorite to replace Biden on ticket\n\n\u201cI am grateful to President Biden and everyone in the Democratic Party who has already put their faith in me, and I look forward to taking our case directly to the American people,\u201d Harris said in a statement released Monday.\n\nAbout 1 in 3 Americans \u2013 35 percent \u2013 said Biden\u2019s exit made them more likely to cast their ballot in November than they were before he left the race. Those experiencing that new burst enthusiasm include 46 percent of Democrats, 35 percent of Republicans and 28 percent of independents. Overall, a majority of Americans said Biden\u2019s decision didn\u2019t affect their likelihood of voting, which may in part reflect the urgency that many voters were already feeling.\n\nIn a letter Sunday, Biden expressed his great honor in having served in the White House, but that he felt \u201cit is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down\u201d and focus on the remainder of his presidency.\n\nAbout two-thirds of Americans say Biden should finish his term as president, including most Democrats and independents. Republicans were split over whether Biden should resign sooner than next January.\n\nThinking about how history might remember Biden\u2019s time in the Oval Office, 13 percent of U.S. adults viewed him as one of the best presidents in the nation\u2019s history, while 37 percent said he was at or above average.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, 31 percent of Americans said Biden has been among the worst presidents in history. For comparison, 47 percent of Americans felt that way about Trump in January 2021, and 17 percent of Americans said that about former President Barack Obama in December 2016 as he prepared to leave office.\n\nBiden will address the nation on Wednesday and is expected to talk about why he chose this moment to end his reelection campaign.\n\n\u201cWhen Biden speaks tomorrow about his decision, I really think it\u2019s going to be a moment for the country to hear from his heart what a tough, sincere but also probably, at the end of the day, easy decision this was because he cares about his country, his party and his legacy,\u201d Parkhomenko said.\n\nTrump vs. Harris\n\nMore so than for Harris, people have made their minds up about Trump. Eight percent of Americans said they were not sure how they felt about him, compared to Harris\u2019 15 percent. Another 49 percent said they hold an unfavorable view of Trump, while 43 percent find him favorable.\n\nFor Republicans to control the narrative, Ayres said they have \u201cgot to drive home the case that the economy was better when Donald Trump was president than when the Democrats were in office,\u201d adding that is \u201ctheir strongest argument, particularly for non-white respondents.\u201d\n\n\u201cHarris has far more room to grow, and Trump has hit his ceiling.\u201d\n\nHarris\u2019 element of the unknown could prove to be an asset on the campaign trail. In the days ahead, she stands to gain from \u201cexciting waves of news,\u201d Parkhomenko said, including the Democratic National Convention and the selection of her own vice president.\n\nTo keep up the momentum for Harris, Parkhomenko said Democrats need to stay focused and build on the unity forged over the last few days. He also said they must find a balance between debunking disinformation from the Trump campaign, \u201cbut at the same time, highlighting what we\u2019re going to do in the next four years. It\u2019s not just what we\u2019ve done\u201d during the Biden administration.\n\n\u201cHarris has far more room to grow, and Trump has hit his ceiling,\u201d Democratic strategist Tory Gavito said. \u201cTrump is stagnant at 46 percent, and he should be soaring right now.\u201d\n\nThe one sure thing to come out of the last two weeks that have felt like a year in political time: Americans are more interested and engaged in the upcoming presidential election than they\u2019ve been in months.\n\nPBS News, NPR and Marist Poll conducted a survey on July 22 that polled 1,309 U.S. adults with a margin of error of 3.2 percentage points, 1,117 registered voters with a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points, 846 registered voters who definitely plan to vote in November\u2019s general election with a margin of error of 4.0 percentage points and 515 Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents with a margin of error of 5.2 percentage points.",

        "text": "Expert: U.S. President Joe Biden has withdrawn from the race. What now?\nOn Sunday, U.S. President Joe Biden announced he was withdrawing from the presidential race and almost immediately endorsed Vice-President Kamala Harris. The move is unprecedented, and with the upcoming Democratic National Convention taking place Aug. 19 to 22, the move has left many wondering what\u2019s next.\n\nWestern News spoke with political science professor Matthew Lebo, whose research focuses on American domestic politics with an emphasis on the presidency, Congress and elections, about what we can expect to see now in the run-up to the U.S. election in November.\n\nWestern News: Is there any precedent for these circumstances? Has this ever happened before?\n\nMatthew Lebo: The closest to a precedent for this was 1968 when Lyndon Johnson announced in March that he would not accept the nomination of the Democratic Party for another term. But Johnson did not endorse anyone and the primaries were not binding, so delegates to the convention were free to vote for whichever candidate they preferred. That led to many months of fighting over the nomination and, ultimately, the fractured party and its candidate, Hubert Humphrey, lost the election.\n\nThere has been talk of a \u2018mini-primary\u2019 \u2013 does this seem likely?\n\nML: A mini-primary seems unlikely at this point. As of Tuesday, enough delegates to the convention have now pledged themselves to Kamala Harris and will have some kind of virtual roll call vote in early August. This essentially makes Vice-President Harris the presumptive nominee going into the convention and avoids a potential battle there. It also makes the next few weeks easier in terms of campaigning, fundraising and choosing a running mate.\n\nWhat does it mean now that President Biden has backed Kamala Harris as the democratic nominee?\n\nML: Despite Biden\u2019s endorsement, Vice-President Harris did not automatically get the delegates that were already pledged to him. However, in the past few days Vice-President Harris became quickly unstoppable; she has been endorsed by nearly all of her potential rivals and the Biden campaign has been handed to her. She has Biden\u2019s organization and his campaign funds, as well as nearly $100 million new dollars.\n\nIf Vice-President Harris is the next democratic nominee, what do you think her chances are?\n\nML: Vice-President Harris should be, at worst, in the same position as Biden was. But she has the potential to do much better. In 2020, Biden won by 7 million votes (and a close electoral college). But polls show a big drop in enthusiasm for Biden that Harris could reverse. She will be a more effective campaigner against Donald Trump, whose chances of winning are a lot lower today than they were two days ago.\n\nWhat about a running mate?\n\nML: Vice-President Harris may settle on a running mate very soon. She will be looking for someone who can help her pull ahead in the close battleground states, most especially Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. The governors of Pennsylvania and Michigan are good bets. There are some others as well. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan is the only woman who is being talked about as a potential running mate so far.\n\nWhat did you make of the Republican response to Biden\u2019s announcement?\n\nML: The message from Donald Trump and the Republicans that they would seek national unity did not last long. They will attack the vice-president and try to tie her to the immigration issue. In his first social media response, Trump said Vice-President Harris is more liberal and more incompetent than President Biden. The Republicans would have preferred Biden to stay in the race.",

        "text": "Joe Biden, Public Opinion and His Withdrawal From the 2024 Race\nJoe Biden, Public Opinion and His Withdrawal From the 2024 Race\n\nJoe Biden\u2019s extraordinary decision to not pursue the Democratic nomination for president has upended the 2024 presidential race, with Vice President Kamala Harris emerging as a strong favorite for the Democratic nomination.\n\nHere are some of the key public opinion dynamics around Biden\u2019s choice.\n\nJob approval\n\nBiden\u2019s job approval ratings have been more negative than positive since late 2021. And only about a third of Americans have approved of his performance for the last year.\n\nBut Biden\u2019s approval rating was far higher in the early months of his presidency.\n\nAt about the 100-day mark of his presidency, Biden\u2019s 59% job rating was on par with approval of several recent presidents. It was 20 percentage points higher than Donald Trump\u2019s at a similar point in his presidency.\n\nThe early days of Biden\u2019s presidency featured some notable successes, including the manufacture and rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine (which began development under the Trump administration) and passage of a $2 trillion coronavirus economic aid package.\n\nHowever, the chaotic U.S. military withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021 proved to be a pivotal moment in Biden\u2019s first year \u2013 and, ultimately, in his presidency.\n\nOnly about a quarter of Americans (26%) \u2013 including fewer than half of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents \u2013 said the administration had done an excellent or good job of handling the situation.\n\nThis period also saw a new variant, and related surge, of COVID-19 \u2013 delaying the expected \u201creturn to normal\u201d following the vaccine rollout earlier in the year.\n\nBiden\u2019s overall job approval declined 11 points, from 55% to 44%, between July and September 2021. It has never been in positive territory since then.\n\nConfidence in Biden\u2019s handling of issues largely followed this same trajectory.\n\nAge and fitness\n\nConcerns about Biden\u2019s age and fitness to serve have been present since he ran for president in 2020.\n\nIn August 2020, Pew Research Center asked registered voters in an open-ended question if they had any potential concerns about the candidate they supported. Nearly a third of Biden supporters named his age or health.\n\nIn the weeks before the 2020 election, Biden was seen by more Americans as honest or compassionate than Trump was, and a larger share described him as a good role model. But Trump had a slight advantage when it came to being \u201cmentally sharp.\u201d\n\nWhile perceptions of some of Biden\u2019s personal traits and characteristics have changed little in the past four years, that\u2019s not the case for his mental acuity: The share of voters who view Biden as mentally sharp declined steadily over the course of his presidency.\n\nIn March 2021, 53% of voters said that \u201cmentally sharp\u201d described Biden very or fairly well. That dropped 20 percentage points over the next two years, to 33% in April 2023.\n\nIt fell another 9 points, to 24%, following his performance in the June 27 debate.\n\nThis pattern is evident in perceptions of Biden\u2019s other personal traits associated with his age, such as whether he is energetic. In January, only 24% of Americans described Biden as energetic, a 16-point drop from 2020.\n\nBiden\u2019s support has long been more about who he isn\u2019t than who he is\n\nBiden trailed Trump in many national surveys in the final weeks of his 2024 campaign. Those margins, including 4 percentage points in our most recent national survey, may not have boded well for the Democrat \u2013 though candidates have overcome larger deficits at this point in the race.\n\nBut among Biden\u2019s own supporters, there were widespread concerns about his age and health \u2013 and his ability to beat Trump.\n\nFrom the outset of his 2020 campaign, much of Biden\u2019s support has been defined not by who Biden is but by who he is not. In 2020, asked in an open-ended question why they supported Biden, a majority of his supporters said simply: \u201cHe is not Trump.\u201d\n\nHeading into the general election this year, the 2024 election was shaping up to be a record battle not just because of the age of the two candidates, but because of the historic size of the share of Americans who didn\u2019t like either one of them. A quarter of Americans fell into this group of so-called \u201cdouble negatives.\u201d\n\nAs of April, nearly half of registered voters (49%) said they wanted to see both candidates replaced on the ballot \u2013 and Biden supporters (62%) were considerably more likely than Trump supporters to say this.\n\nFollowing Biden\u2019s poor showing in the June 27 debate, his own supporters\u2019 calls for him to be replaced only increased. By early July, 71% of voters who backed Biden also said they would prefer to see both candidates replaced on the ballot.\n\nHow we did this This Pew Research Center analysis focuses on public opinion of Joe Biden as context for his decision to withdraw from the 2024 presidential election. Most of the public opinion data in this analysis comes from Pew Research Center surveys over the course of Biden\u2019s presidency and has been featured in recent Center reports. Links to these reports, including details about the survey methodology, are available in the text. The first chart on presidential approval includes data from the Gallup organization on Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush\u2019s presidential approval ratings.\n\nPhoto: President Joe Biden talks to reporters outside the White House before boarding Marine One in January 2023. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images)",

        "text": "Who is running for president in 2024? A look at the candidates still in the race\nThe 2024 presidential election took a turn on Sunday after President Joe Biden withdrew from the race and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as his potential successor atop the ticket for the Democratic Party.\n\nBiden, 81, who faced increased pressure to leave the race after he appeared disoriented at a televised debate with Trump last month, passed the torch to Harris, who soon announced her bid for the party's nomination. Behind the scenes, the Biden campaign machine switched gears to benefit the vice president.\n\nHarris is expected to be in Delaware Monday, according to U.S. Sen. Tom Carper. Harris is expected to arrive in New Castle County Monday afternoon, where she will meet with members of the Delaware delegation and go to Biden's campaign headquarters in Wilmington, which is expected to transition to hers as she mounts her presidential campaign.\n\nHere's what to know about who is running for president in the 2024 election.\n\nDonald Trump\n\nFormer President Donald Trump formally accepted the Republican Party's nomination on the final day of the Republican National Convention last Thursday in Milwaukee.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nTrump, in his first public remarks since narrowly escaping a would-be assassin's bullet, described in a hushed and somber voice being hit in the ear, ducking for cover, finding his hand drenched with blood and then raising his fist in the air \u2212 an effort, he said, to reassure the supporters at the Pennsylvania rally that he was alright.\n\n\"I stand before you in this arena only by the grace of almighty God,\" he told the crowd at the Republican National Convention, calling for national unity.\n\nKamala Harris\n\nHarris is now the presumptive favorite to earn the Democratic Party's nomination for president at the Democratic National Convention next month in Chicago.\n\nOn Sunday, after Biden called to tell her he was ending his reelection campaign, Harris whipped up a statement and placed calls to lawmakers, governors, civil rights leaders and union bosses, thanking them for their endorsements and telling them how she planned to earn the presidential nomination.\n\nHarris would ultimately make more than 100 calls over the next 10 hours, speaking to Biden multiple times as she took the reins of the flailing 2024 presidential campaign.\n\nInside KamalaHQ:How Harris quickly began plotting campaign after Biden's shocking exit\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. is an independent candidate for president.\n\nKennedy held a news conference in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts after Biden announced he was withdrawing from the race Sunday afternoon.\n\n\"I'm the only candidate who can beat President Trump,\" Kennedy said on X Sunday.\n\nMarianne Williamson\n\nMarianne Williamson is a candidate for the Democratic nomination for the 2024 presidential election.\n\nWilliamson's website says she is a \"bestselling author, political activist and spiritual thought leader\" and has authored 16 books, four of which have been No. 1 New York Times bestsellers.\n\nIn a statement posted on social media Sunday, Williamson said she called for Biden to \"step down from his renomination bid the day after the Trump-Biden debate\" on June 27.\n\n\"There is nothing we have seen since that night that wasn\u2019t on full view in the debate. Effective crisis management would have called for all those who are calling for him to step down now, to do so immediately - when I did,\" the statement reads.\n\nJill Stein\n\nJill Stein announced in November 2023 that she would be seeking the Green Party's nomination in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nStein, 74, is a physician and environmental activist who previously ran for president in 2012 and 2016. In a video announcing her campaign, Stein said she wants to offer voters a choice \"outside of the failed two-party system.\"\n\nCornel West\n\nCornel West launched his bid for the White House in June 2023 under the People's Party, but has since announced he is running as an independent.\n\nWest, 71, is a longtime philosopher, activist and author who has served as a professor at Harvard University, Yale University and other institutions.\n\nChase Oliver\n\nChase Oliver, a Libertarian, won his party's nomination in May.\n\nThe 38-year-old describes himself as \"armed and gay\" and previously ran for the Senate in Georgia in 2022, receiving about 2% of the vote.\n\nContributing: USA TODAY staff\n\nGabe Hauari is a national trending news reporter at USA TODAY.

He said in a letter posted on X that he would remain in office until the end of his term and address the country later this week on his decision.\n\n\n\nBelow are reactions from politicians and advocacy groups:\n\n\n\nFormer President Donald Trump\n\n\n\nIn a phone call with CNN minutes after Biden announced his exit from the 2024 race, former President Trump responded, \u201cHe is the worst president in the history of our country. He goes down as the single worst president by far in the history of our country.\u201d Trump also said he thought Vice President Kamala Harris will be easier to defeat than Biden would have been, according to CNN.\n\n\n\nChuck Schumer, senate majority leader\n\n\n\n\"Joe Biden has not only been a great president and a great legislative leader but he is a truly amazing human being. His decision of course was not easy, but he once again put his country, his party, and our future first. Joe, today shows you are a true patriot and great American,\" the Democrat said in a statement.\n\n\n\nElise Stefanik, House Republican conference chairwoman\n\n\n\n\"If Joe Biden can\u2019t run for re-election, he is unable and unfit to serve as President of the United States. He must immediately resign,\" Stefanik said in a statement.\n\n\n\nGavin Newsom, Governor of California\n\n\n\n\"President Biden has been an extraordinary, history-making president \u2014 a leader who has fought hard for working people and delivered astonishing results for all Americans. He will go down in history as one of the most impactful and selfless presidents,\" Newsom posted on X.\n\n\n\nDonald Trump Jr\n\n\n\n\"Kamala Harris owns the entire leftwing policy record of Joe Biden. The only difference is that she is even more liberal and less competent than Joe, which is really saying something. She was put in charge of the border and we saw the worst invasion of illegals in our history!!!\" Donald Jr said on X.\n\n\n\nErich Pica, President of Friends of the Earth Action\n\n\n\n\"We thank President Biden for his decades of leadership and support the decision to end his re-election campaign. While far from perfect, Biden has taken some historic steps to address the climate crisis by passing the Inflation Reduction Act and kickstarting major investments in renewable energy.\n\n\n\n\"What\u2019s at stake in this election remains the same: Trump is an existential threat to our democracy and the planet and would guarantee a full descent into climate chaos,\" Pica said in a statement.\n\n\n\nGretchen Whitmer, Governor of Michigan\n\n\n\n\"President Biden is a great public servant who knows better than anyone what it takes to defeat Donald Trump. His remarkable work to lower prescription drug costs, fix the damn roads, bring supply chains home, address climate change, and ensure America\u2019s global leadership over decades will go down in history. My job in this election will remain the same: doing everything I can to elect Democrats and stop Donald Trump, a convicted felon whose agenda of raising families' costs, banning abortion nationwide, and abusing the power of the White House to settle his own scores is completely wrong for Michigan,\" Whitmer said on X.\n\n",

        "text": "Who is Kamala Harris and will she be the first woman US president?\nJoe Biden's chosen successor has had a sometimes rocky path to power, and a campaign against Donald Trump will test her like never before.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhen Joe Biden dropped out of the US presidential election after weeks of pressure from his party, he quickly made clear he had only one successor in mind.\n\n\"My very first decision as the party nominee in 2020 was to pick Kamala Harris as my Vice President,\" he wrote in a post on X.\n\n\"And it\u2019s been the best decision I\u2019ve made. Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year. Democrats \u2014 it\u2019s time to come together and beat Trump. Let\u2019s do this.\"\n\nIn her own statement, Harris wrote: \"On behalf of the American people, I thank Joe Biden for his extraordinary leadership as president of the United States and for his decades of service to our country.\n\n\"I am honoured to have the president\u2019s endorsement and my intention is to earn and win this nomination.\"\n\nHarris still has to be formally nominated by the party at its convention in Chicago in a few weeks' time, and it is not yet known if she will face a challenger.\n\nBut the combination of her current position, Biden's support and the collective exhaustion from the effort to get him to stand down will make it difficult for other candidates to explain why she should have to fight for the nomination \u2014 especially since, if elected, she would be the nation's first woman president and only its second black president.\n\nSo how did Harris get to the brink of the presidency?\n\nKamala Harris, the would-be 47th president of the US. Joe Lamberti/Copyright 2024 The AP. All rights reserved\n\nThe daughter of a Jamaican-American father and a Tamil Indian mother, the 59-year-old Harris grew up in Oakland, California. After graduating from university and law school, she became a district attorney, working her way up in California's legal system before being elected the state's attorney general in 2010.\n\nRe-elected in 2014, she was then elected to the US Senate in 2016, replacing outgoing Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer. Once in the Senate, Harris quickly became nationally renowned for bringing her prosecutorial skills to bear in committee hearings, subjecting heavily briefed and experienced witnesses to forensic questioning that several times made news in its own right.\n\nAmong these were Trump's only two confirmed attorneys general, Jeff Sessions and Bill Barr, and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nThe Kavanaugh confirmation process in 2018, which ultimately saw the judge confirmed to the US' highest court, is now most remembered for serious allegations of sexual assault levelled publicly against him by women who had known him in high school and college.\n\nHowever, before the allegations were made and then discussed in the Senate, Harris had already used the hearings to exert pressure on Kavanaugh over his restrictive views on abortion, memorably asking him if he could think of \"any laws that give government the power to make decisions about the male body?\"\n\nNot long after the Kavanaugh hearings, Harris announced she was running for the Democratic presidential nomination \u2014 a campaign that would pit her against Biden.\n\n'That little girl was me'\n\nHaving built a powerful national brand in a relatively short span of time, Harris launched her presidential campaign in January 2019. Her first campaign rally drew 20,000 supporters, and her first-day fundraising figures indicated she was a force to be reckoned with.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHowever, the Democratic field soon ballooned to more than 20 candidates, and setting herself apart on policy became hard for Harris, especially against bold left-wingers Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.\n\nHer most memorable moment, ironically, came when she confronted Biden during a TV debate about his opposition to the \"bussing\" policies implemented to aid school desegregation after the passage of the Civil Rights Act. Calling him out for his \"civil\" relationship with segregationist senators in the early 1970s, she reminded Biden of the impact desegregation had.\n\n\u201cAnd you know, there was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bussed to school every day. And that little girl was me.\u201d\n\nThe exchange turned out to be the high point of Harris' campaign. Come the third quarter of 2019, it was clear that her campaign was internally disorganised, had a high staff turnover, and was struggling to raise money. Even as the Democratic field began to shrink and consolidate around the early frontrunners, her polling numbers did not rise, and she dropped out before the first primaries.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThen, in the summer of 2020, Biden chose her as his running mate, describing her as \"a fearless fighter for the little guy and one of the country\u2019s finest public servants.\"\n\nThe constraints of the COVID-19 pandemic notwithstanding, she proved to be a strong campaigner in the 2020 race, delivering an effective debate performance against Trump's Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nWhen she and Biden won the election, Harris became the first woman, the first black person and the first person of South Asian background to serve as US vice president in one stroke.\n\nHarris' time as vice president, however, would prove to be difficult.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTough at the top\n\nThe Biden administration began in the shadow of the 6 January 2021 attack on the US Capitol, and with the pandemic still killing Americans in their thousands while the economy struggled to cope.\n\nIn this context, Biden assigned Harris a portfolio of towering issues, among them immigration and voting rights \u2014 deeply divisive questions that could only be tackled via major legislation, something that in turn demanded the support of a Senate supermajority that the Democrats did not command.\n\nHarris thus found herself trying to make the case for sweeping reforms that never stood much chance of success on Capitol Hill. Her effort to tackle the US' decades-old immigration problems was not helped by an infamous interview in which she visibly bristled when asked why she had not yet visited the US-Mexico border.\n\nThere was also a steady stream of negative stories about the atmosphere in Harris' office, which saw strikingly high staff turnover in the administration's early years, and outsiders speculated unflatteringly about just how meaningful her role actually was.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHowever, as Biden's re-election campaign kicked into gear, Harris once again began appearing on the campaign trail, where she has once again proven she is able to draw and enthuse a crowd even as the ageing president increasingly struggled.\n\nWhen it became clear that the party was turning against the prospect of Biden running again, speculation that she would be the natural successor immediately began to rise, leading to an explosion of memes riffing on her distinctive laugh and repeated invocation of one of her mother's favourite sayings: \"You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?\"\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Harris can improve upon Biden's anaemic poll numbers and flagging fundraising, and it is still unclear whether she will face a challenge for the nomination.\n\nHowever, the relief at Biden's withdrawal will send new energy and optimism through her party, at least in the short term \u2014 and the Trump campaign's well-honed attacks on the president's age are now suddenly moot.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMore embarrassingly for her rival, the electorate is already being reminded that before he entered politics himself, he personally donated to both her California campaigns.",

        "text": "Project 2025: What a second Trump term could mean for media and technology policies\nSections Print\n\nBack to top Introduction\n\nIn a 900-page volume titled Project 2025, a conservative movement of over 400 scholars led by the Heritage Foundation has outlined a comprehensive policy vision for what a conservative administration could implement upon taking office in January 2025. The writers and contributors make recommendations regarding foreign and domestic policy, education, and the economy to give the administration a running start into a short four-year term. Critics have called it a blueprint for autocratic takeover. This blog will look at a key aspect of Project 2025\u2019s blueprint: Its plans for technology, media, and communications policies and the potential implications on the future of existing public policies.\n\nBack to top Project 2025: A vision for conservative administrations\n\nBack to top The media as the \u201cenemy of the American people\u201d\n\nBack to top Project 2025\u2019s complaints about Big Tech and social media platforms\n\nBack to top The next frontier: Project 2025 on Artificial Intelligence\n\nOn the topic of artificial intelligence (AI), Project 2025 focuses on the adversarial relationship with China: The U.S., according to them, must subvert China\u2019s goal to become the global leader on AI.63 To do so, the government should invest in and protect American innovation64 while barring American companies from helping China achieve technological dominance.65 The authors also envision the use of AI to support a variety of processes, such as the detection and disruption of foreign interference on social media66 and the detection of Medicare and trade abuses.67 Project 2025\u2019s AI policy is neither clear nor comprehensive. OpenAI, the key player in the market currently under FTC investigation, finds no mention in the 920-page volume, neither do its competitors. Privacy and copyright concerns related to the vast amounts of training data required to build AI seem to be of little concern, and so are the risk of job loss related to AI, the potential harm of AI-generated misleading content such as deepfakes, or its impact on energy consumption and climate change. Biden\u2019s Executive Order on AI mandates principles such as standards for AI safety, protection of user privacy and civil rights, and promoting healthy competition and innovation. Trump has said he will reverse this Executive Order, claiming it is an example of government overreach. The AI industry is developing at a rapid pace: Comprehensive policy must be in place to protect individuals and societies, curtail abuses of power, and guide research in beneficial, safe directions.\n\nBack to top Project 2025 \u2013 or Agenda47?\n\nTrump continues to deny involvement in Project 2025 despite harboring close connections to its authors, praising it in the past, and even acknowledging in a speech in 2022 that the Heritage Foundation would write a detailed plan for the movement\u2019s next administration. And the plans laid out in Agenda47, Trump\u2019s own official policy agenda, closely echo those of Project 2025. In short videos on his campaign website former president Trump, though in much less detail than the 900-page volume, outlines his vision for a second term, which, on technology policy issues, includes investigations of Big Tech and the FBI for what he describes as an anti-American regime of censorship; intentions to block federal efforts to curb domestic mis- and disinformation, and the firing and investigating of employees engaged in this task in the Department of Justice, Homeland Security, or any other agency. He also plans to revise Section 230; limit social media\u2019s ability to both moderate content and ban individuals from their platforms; and bring both the FCC and the FTC under presidential authority. On technology and media policy, Project 2025 and Agenda47 have common themes: Plans to expand presidential power and limit departmental agency, accusations that technology companies and the government colluded in what they deem censorship, and restricting Chinese ownership and investments. Like the language used by the Heritage Foundation, Agenda47 ties Trump\u2019s technology and communication policy to conservative values and ideals, saying: \u201cThe fight for Free Speech [capitalization in original] is a matter of victory or death for America\u2014and for the survival of Western Civilization [capitalization in original] itself.\u201d And both plans fail to provide detailed visions for how to regulate AI. The policy agendas mirror each other closely, and both suggest a vision for technology and communication policy that is both repressive and lax.\n\nBack to top The ultimate vision: An end to perceived attacks on and censorship of conservatism\n\nThe policy agenda outlined in Project 2025 is seemingly motivated by a sense of discrimination against conservative ideology.68 The federal government, it says, has been \u201cweaponized against conservative values,\u201d69 putting \u201cliberty and freedom under siege.\u201d70 In response, the authors aim to weaken those institutions which they consider part of the attack. Their domestic enemies in technology and communication policy range from the mainstream media generally and public broadcasting specifically to Big Tech and includes the agencies which support and regulate them. If enacted, these policies could harm democracy by restricting press access to the administration and defunding those that report on them, create a mainstream internet landscape which mirrors unmoderated breeding grounds for extremism such as 4chan, and miss the opportunity to enact comprehensive and safe data protections and guardrails for AI.",

        "text": "Will Vice President Harris beat Trump? Historian who's predicted 9 of the last 10 elections weighs in\nPresident Joe Biden's withdrawal from the presidential race Sunday sent polling statistics and frontrunner theories back to square one.\n\nSo far this year, Republican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump had led President Biden in most polls, but after the Democrat dropped out of the race and backed Vice President Kamala Harris as the party's new candidate, it remained to be seen how the new nominee would fare.\n\nOn Tuesday, a Reuters/Ipsos poll showed Harris now leading Trump 44% to 42%. The two had been tied in the outlet's poll from the week prior, though that was before she officially entered the race.\n\nAnd as other polling statistics continue to trickle in, political strategists and American voters alike are trying to evaluate the new state of the 2024 presidential race.\n\nBut is it still too early to tell how it will all play out? Not if you ask Allan Lichtman.\n\nThe historian and 51-year American University professor is the creator of a presidential election prediction system called \"Keys to the White House,\" which uses 13 true-false criteria to forecast the winning candidate. It's helped Lichtman correctly predict 9 of the 10 most recent presidential elections.\n\nRELATED STORY | An election historian explains why Biden should stay in the race\n\nAfter President Biden's shaky debate performance last month and calls for him to drop out of the race amplified, Lichtman told Scripps News the Democrats' only chance of winning was if the commander-in-chief stayed in the running.\n\nBut on Tuesday, Lichtman told us that although the president stepping aside cost the party one of the \"keys\" \u2014 that being the incumbency key \u2014 he believes Democrats will \"avoid disaster\" by their coalescing around Harris as the likely nominee, thereby avoiding the loss of the contest key.\n\nLichtman said this now puts the Democrats down only three keys. They are party mandate \u2014 which he defines as the incumbent party holding more seats in the U.S. House of Representatives after midterm elections than before, which didn't happen \u2014 incumbency, and incumbent charisma, which Lichtman said was a loss \"because Harris is not an FDR.\"\n\nLichtman told Scripps News for the incumbent to be counted out of the race, they would need to be down six total keys \u2014 meaning three more would have to fall.\n\n\"That can happen, but it's not likely. So as a result of the Democrats retaining the contest key, I continue to say, a lot would have to go wrong for the Democrats to lose this election,\" Lichtman said.\n\nRELATED STORY | Kamala Harris secures enough delegates to clinch the Democratic nomination for president\n\nThe other keys a candidate can use to win in Lichtman's model include:\n\nwhether the incumbent sees a significant third-party candidate\n\nwhether the economy is in recession\n\nlong-term economic growth\n\nmajor policy change\n\nwhether there is sustained social unrest during the campaign cycle\n\nbeing untainted by scandal\n\nsuffering no foreign/military failure\n\nachieving foreign/military success\n\nwhether the challenging party's candidate is charismatic or a national hero\n\nBecause the keys largely depend on the incumbent's actions, Lichtman claims it's going to be a struggle for Trump to outpace Harris at any point. He says this is particularly apparent because she's retained much of President Biden's campaign team and structure \u2014 and his keys.\n\n\"Trump is in deep trouble. You don't change keys. He has no influence over the keys that decide an election,\" Lichtman said. \"She has all the trappings of a strong administration. All the money goes to her. The donors are rallying to her. The delegates are rallying, and the rank-and-file voters seem to be rallying. And Trump has to totally recalibrate his campaign. 'Dementia Joe' is not going to fly with vigorous Harris here.\"\n\nLichtman said his final prediction won't come until August, after the Democratic National Convention. In part, he said this is because he's waiting until then to decide on the social unrest key.",

But concerns remain about her ability to compete in a general election against former President Donald Trump .",
        "text": "Can Kamala Harris Beat Trump? Here's What Polls Show\nThe Democratic Party appears to be injected with new energy following President Joe Biden\u2019s decision on Sunday to drop out from the race and endorse Kamala Harris. She raised a record-breaking $81 million within 24 hours of announcing her candidacy, and as of Monday night, Harris has secured enough support from delegates at the Democratic National Convention to clinch the Democratic nomination.\n\nBut even if Harris becomes the Democratic nominee at the convention in August, concerns remain about her ability to compete in a general election against former President Donald Trump.\n\nA slight majority of Americans have a negative opinion of Harris, according to FiveThirtyEight polling, citing polls conducted before Biden dropped out. Some 51% of Americans disapprove of Harris to 38% who approve. Trump has a higher disapproval rating at 53%, but 39% of Americans approve of him.\n\nAggregated election polls show Harris lagging behind the former President by a small, but not insurmountable margin of 1.5 percentage points on average, according to an analysis done by the Washington Post of 11 different pollsters. These figures are only a slight improvement on President Joe Biden, who trails Trump by 1.9 percentage points. However, all of these polls were conducted before Biden\u2019s drop-out announcement, and surveys about the potential performance of hypothetical candidates are often inaccurate.\n\nWith those caveats, here are what some of the most respected polls show:\n\nABC News/The Washington Post/Ipsos\n\nABC News, The Washington Post, and Ipsos conducted a poll from July 6 to July 9 interviewing 2,431 U.S. registered voters via phone. ABC News/The Washington Post polls are ranked second in FiveThirtyEight\u2019s list of best pollsters after the New York Times/Siena College, which has yet to release a national survey on a Harris vs. Trump matchup.\n\nTheir survey found that Harris outperformed Trump by 2 percentage points. That was slightly better than Biden, who in the same poll, performed exactly the same as Trump. However, this poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points, which means that Trump and Harris were neck and neck.\n\nThe Economist/YouGov\n\nIn a poll conducted by The Economist and YouGov from July 13 to July 16 that questioned 1,404 U.S. registered voters, Harris trailed behind Trump by 5 percentage points, performing worse than Biden, who trailed Trump by 2 percentage points. The margin of error on this poll was plus or minus 3 percentage points.\n\nReuters/Ipsos\n\nReuters and Ipsos conducted a poll on July 16 surveying 1,202 adults living in the U.S. in the aftermath of the assassination attempt on Trump. The survey found that the former U.S. President narrowly edged out Harris by 1 percentage point. The same poll showed Trump outperforming Biden by 3 percentage points. The margin of error on these questions was plus or minus 3.1 percentage points, meaning that Trump and Harris\u2014as well as Trump and Biden\u2014were neck and neck in this poll.\n\nYahoo! News/YouGov\n\nYahoo! News and YouGov conducted a poll from June 28 to July 1, after Biden\u2019s botched debate performance but before the assassination attempt on Trump. The poll showed Trump outperforming Harris by 2 percentage points, the same figure he outperformed Biden by.\n\nThe poll also found that while 38% of voters who lean Democrat preferred Harris as the replacement for Biden, 42% believed that someone else would be a better fit for the nomination. The survey polled 1,754 American adults.\n\nThe New York Times/Siena College\n\nThe New York Times/Siena College poll is considered the most accurate in the country, according to FiveThirtyEight\u2019s rankings. While they have yet to release a national survey on Harris vs. Trump, polls in the swing states of Pennsylvania and Virginia from July 9 to July 12 found that Trump led Harris by 2 percentage points in Pennsylvania, within the margin of error of 3.7. Harris outperformed Trump by 5 percentage points in Virginia, where the margin of error was 4.2.",

And that time and place is now.\"\n\nThe Oval Office address marked Mr Biden's first extensive public comments since posting an open letter on social media announcing his decision on Sunday.\n\nLoading...\n\n\"I've given my heart and my soul to our nation, like so many others,\" he said.\n\n\"And I'm blessed a million times in return with the love and support of the American people. I hope you have some idea how grateful I am to all of you.\n\n\"The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule. The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America, lies in your hands.\"\n\nLive Moment Joe Biden has delivered remarks from the Oval Office, telling Americans \"now is the time for fresh voices\" and urging them to unite ahead of the November election. 'The power is in your hands' In his final remarks, the president tells Americans, it's up to them. \"History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America, lies in your hands. You just have to keep faith. Keep the faith. \"And remember who we are, we are the United States of America. And there are simply nothing, nothing beyond our capacity. We do it together. So let's act together.\"\n\nBiden says it has been 'the privilege of my life' to serve The president says he has given his heart and soul to the United States. \"My fellow Americans, it has been the privilege of my life to serve this nation for over 50 years. \"Nowhere else on earth could a kid with a stutter from modest beginnings in Scranton, Pennsylvania, Claymont, Delaware, one day sit behind the resolute desk in the Oval Office as president United States. But here I am.\"\n\nJoe Biden thanks Kamala Harris In closing, Joe Biden thanks his vice-president, Kamala Harris, who he describes as \"experienced, tough, capable\", and an \"incredible partner to me and a leader for our country\". \"Now the choice is up to you, the American people. \"When you make that choice, remember the words of Benjamin Franklin's, hanging on my wall here in the Oval Office \u2026 republic \u2014 if you can keep it. Whether we keep our republic is now in your hands.\"\n\nShow more\n\nMr Biden was in isolation with COVID when he announced his decision via the X platform, writing: \"While it has been my intention to seek re-election, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as president for the remainder of my term.\"\n\nIt followed weeks of sustained pressure from a growing number of prominent Democrats who were concerned about his visible signs of aging, and his ability to compete with Republican nominee Donald Trump.\n\nWithin minutes of the president's address, the Trump campaign sent a fundraising email to potential donors, which said if Mr Biden \"had an ounce of humility, he'd understand he's unfit to serve\".\n\n\"But now Kamala Harris is poised to continue his path of destruction. Shadow billionaires just unfroze tens of millions of dollars to bankroll her campaign!\"\n\nAt an earlier campaign rally in North Carolina, Trump attacked his likely opponent as a \"radical left lunatic who will destroy our country if she ever gets the chance to get into office\".\n\n\"For three-and-a-half years, lyin' Kamala Harris has been the ultra-liberal driving force behind every single Biden catastrophe,\" he said.\n\nMr Biden endorsed Ms Harris half an hour after announcing he would not run for re-election, and she has since won the backing of most top Democrats, including those who had been seen as her potential rivals.\n\nOn Monday, she announced she had secured the votes of the necessary number of delegates to lock in the nomination.\n\nShe watched Mr Biden's address to the nation from Houston, Texas, where she had been briefed on recovery efforts following Hurricane Beryl, a White House official said.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, the vice-president made a pitch to thousands of Black women at an event in Indianapolis.\n\n\"Our nation, as it always has, is counting on you to energise, to organise and to mobilise,\" Ms Harris told the convention for a historically Black sorority group, Zeta Phi Beta.\n\nShe is yet to announce a vice-presidential running mate.",

She is California\u2019s first female and South Asian attorney general. In 2021, she became the first woman to become vice president, in addition to being the first Black or Asian American person in the position.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAnd, if she were to win the general election against former President Donald Trump, she would become the first woman president of the United States.\n\nHere are five things to know about Harris:\n\n\n\n1. She ran for president in 2020 but didn\u2019t get very far.\n\ntoggle caption Gabrielle Lurie/The San Francisco Chronicle via Getty Images\n\nHarris announced in 2019 she would run for the White House, and while Harris notably pushed Biden on his previous record over desegregation and busing, that was the high point of her run. Most of her bid, in fact, was riddled with campaign hiccups and minimal momentum.\n\nShe was criticized for how she championed tough truancy policies when she was the attorney general for California, which some said perpetuated inequities in the criminal justice system and disproportionately affected families of color. Harris later said she regretted the \"unintended consequences\" that law had on families.\n\nMore broadly, Harris failed to distinguish her positions on key issues, in ways that her competitors, such as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, were able to. In the months following, Harris failed to gain steam with limited funds and little excitement behind her campaign, and she dropped out by December 2019.\n\n2. She has a mixed legacy in criminal justice\n\ntoggle caption Ted Soqui/Corbis via Getty Images\n\nDuring her 2020 presidential bid, Harris ran to the left of Biden on several criminal justice issues, like ending solitary confinement and implementing a national standard on the use of deadly force.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBut her \u201ctough on crime\u201d track record as a prosecutor, district attorney, and attorney general in California during the 1990s and 2000s is a clear reminder of her complicated and sometimes contradictory legacy on the criminal justice system.\n\nOn the one hand, she established a reentry program in the early 2000s that was seen as a form of restorative justice. She supported legislation that would expand voting rights to those serving felony sentences. She also opposed the death penalty \u2014 and stood by that when she did not seek the death penalty against a gang member who killed a police officer in 2004. But when the opportunity came to get rid of the death penalty in California, Harris appealed that ruling. Then, when California Gov. Gavin Newsom put a moratorium on the death penalty in 2019, Harris praised Newsom for the decision, and subsequently called for a federal moratorium on executions.\n\nIt took her years as San Francisco\u2019s district attorney to adopt a defendant\u2019s rights policy known as the Brady doctrine, even though her staff recommended the policy to her in 2005. As state attorney general, she rejected the use of advanced DNA testing in the case of a Black man who was \u2014 and still is \u2014 on death row for a notable murder case, though she has since said she felt \u201cawful\u201d about that decision. She also did not go after cases that involved killings by the police in San Francisco shortly after the 2014 killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., which brought on the ire of protesters in Oakland. The year after, she declined to support a bill that would have her office investigate officer-involved shootings, and she did not back statewide standards over body cameras worn by police officers.\n\n3. She is known for high-profile grillings early in the Trump administration\n\ntoggle caption Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\n\nIt was 2018. Harris was still a relative newcomer in the Senate. And yet, she made a splash when she grilled Brett Kavanaugh, Trump\u2019s then-nominee for the Supreme Court.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cCan you think of any laws that give government the power to make decisions about the male body?\u201d she asked Kavanaugh in a question pointedly about reproductive rights.\n\nAfter Kavanaugh struggled to give an answer, Harris repeated the question. Kavanaugh\u2019s final response: \u201cI'm not thinking of any right now, senator.\u201d\n\nThat was one of several viral moments of Harris as she went after officials and politicians tied to the Trump administration, including former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, former White House chief of staff John Kelly, and former Attorney General William Barr.\n\nWhile Trump called her \u201cnasty\u201d for how she questioned Kavanaugh, her line of questioning piqued Trump\u2019s interest when she was freshly nominated by Biden to be his running mate in 2020, showing him and Republicans she was capable of going after them.\n\n4. It took a while to find her footing as VP, but when she did, she focused on issues that are key to younger voters\n\ntoggle caption Sarah Silbiger/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nDespite Harris\u2019 underwhelming performance in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, Biden nominated her to be his running mate, making her the first Black woman and person of Indian descent to be nominated by a major party for national office. The announcement was celebrated by many in the party: She had been seen as a rising leader among Democrats, and capable of leading an increasingly diversifying party and country.\n\nBut things went off to a rocky start when she entered the White House. She misstepped in an interview with NBC\u2019s Lester Holt when answering why she had not yet visited the border at the time, had turnover in her staff, and had consistently low approval ratings early into her tenure as vice president.\n\nAlthough Harris was initially seen as uncomfortable in the role, she quickly grew into the job. Harris said the Supreme Court\u2019s overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022 galvanized her, and she rewrote an entire speech she was supposed to deliver at an event about maternal health that day. She became the primary messenger on abortion and reproductive rights. Additionally, she campaigned aggressively for gun safety, has tried to connect with more women and people of color during her tenure, and was praised by progressives for her forceful call for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n5. Her race and gender have made her subject to sexist and racist attacks\n\ntoggle caption Kamil Krzaczynski/AFP via Getty Images\n\nWhile many women in politics are often victims of sexist remarks and verbal abuse, a 2020 study tracking more than 300,000 instances of gendered abuse and disinformation against 13 women political candidates found that Harris was the target of such attacks 78% of the time.\n\nNina Jankowicz, who researches disinformation targeting women in politics and is the co-founder and CEO of the American Sunlight Project, said harmful narratives are \u201cpart of the criticism and abuse that women in public life frequently receive.\u201d\n\nThe attacks against Harris in particular have often come from many on the right, including Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance. Trump advanced a birtherism conspiracy theory about Harris that falsely stated she was not qualified to run as vice president back in 2020. Trump also called Harris \u201ccrazy,\u201d and often ridicules the way she laughs \u2014 yet another display of hyper-criticizing women\u2019s voices.\n\nAnd Jankowicz said that it\u2019s important to call out the sexist and racist online trolling against Harris that\u2019s only grown since Biden\u2019s announcement on Sunday.\n\n\u201cAnd I just think it's really important at this historic moment that we label these narratives and lies as what they are: an attempt to undermine Kamala Harris' public service and her record of public service because of her gender, her background and her skin color,\u201d she said.",

        "text": "Vatican responds to Biden's withdrawal from the US presidential race\nThe Vatican typically refrains from commenting on the political affairs of any specific country. However, Rome made a notable exception by publishing an editorial on July 23 in L\u2019Osservatore Romano about President Joe Biden's July 21 announcement to exit the presidential election race.\n\n\u201cThis is a \u2018noble decision,\u2019\u201d wrote Alessandro Gisotti, in the editorial for the Vatican\u2019s official newspaper. He further remarked that by doing so, the Democratic president is \u201cplacing the country\u2019s welfare above his personal interests.\u201d\n\nDecisions uninfluenced by electoral campaigns\n\n\u201cWithout the need to make decisions solely for the electoral campaign, it is hoped that the American president will launch new bold and creative initiatives to achieve the goals that will define his historical legacy, particularly in foreign policy, starting with ending the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East,\u201d the newspaper editorial continued.\n\n\u201cIn 1999, Nelson Mandela made a similar \u2014 and in some ways even more significant and evocative \u2014 decision by choosing not to run for a second presidential term and withdrawing from public life,\u201d commented Gisotti.\n\nA parallel with Benedict XVI\n\nIn his editorial, Gisotti also drew an unexpected parallel with Benedict XVI, who resigned in 2013. \u201cEvery time a prominent figure chooses to step back, it immediately garners the sympathy and esteem of the public,\u201d Gisotti wrote. \u201cWe witnessed this vividly on February 11, 2013, with Benedict XVI\u2019s historic resignation. We also see this \u2014 albeit in a different context \u2014 just as clearly in the past 24 hours.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. election is closely watched at the Vatican, where some officials express concern about the possibility of Republican candidate and former president Donald Trump returning to the White House. This concern was amplified by the strong relationship with Biden's administration, a practicing Catholic, which has been very positive since his election in 2020. The pope thus loses a trusted interlocutor for the future. The Vatican also benefits from strong American support for its humanitarian efforts in Ukraine.\n\nThe pope as a messenger\n\nIn some diplomatic circles, Pope Francis is seen as a conduit to convey messages to the Catholic Democratic president. This was evident in the early months of the Ukraine war when some governments feared that excessive American arms deliveries could escalate the conflict into a global war. More recently, this has also been the case concerning the Middle East crisis, where governments have asked the pope to support some of their requests to the American president.",

        "text": "Who is Kamala Harris and how might she fare against Trump?\nOnce in the Senate, Harris was appointed to the homeland security and intelligence committees and later the Senate Judiciary Committee, which gave her a platform to grill Trump\u2019s judicial nominees. Whether it be questioning then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh on whether the government had ever made laws related to the male body, or the Mueller investigation\u2019s of the Trump campaign\u2019s collusion with Russia, Harris became known for using her prosecutorial experience to advance Democratic priorities.\n\nYet as much as some of her Senate performances became well-known among political pundits, her most well-known moment in the national spotlight was before being elected vice president. And it was at Biden\u2019s expense during her campaign to be the Democratic presidential nominee in 2020.\n\nShe had already caught the country\u2019s attention with a heavily publicised launch in Oakland, California \u2013 this was near where she was born, her parents had worked and she had worked as a district attorney. But at the first Democratic Party debate, Harris directly targeted the then-former vice president, criticising Biden for positive comments he had made about pro-segregation politicians with whom he had served in his 36 years in the US Senate.\n\nWhile Biden had long postured that his willingness to work with diverse politicians was a political and legislative strength, Harris countered that:\n\nYou also worked with them to oppose bussing. And, you know, there was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bussed to school every day. And that little girl was me.\n\nAs compelling as her launch and debate performance was, Harris\u2019 2020 presidential campaign was widely reported to be beset with disorganisation and the absence of compelling policy proposals. Sliding polls and funding numbers led to her suspending her campaign months before the Iowa caucuses, and long before a single vote was cast in Democratic primaries.\n\nNonetheless, her viral debate performance established her as a formidable politician and debate opponent \u2013 such skills were particularly well-reviewed when she deployed them against then vice president Mike Pence in their 2020 debate.",

        "text": "Biden isn't the first president to drop a reelection bid\nIf 2024 has taught us anything, it's that no presidential election is ever the same. This year's contest featured the first major-party nomination of a former president \u2014 Donald Trump \u2014 since Democrats backed Grover Cleveland in the 1892 election. And this past weekend, President Joe Biden became the first presumptive nominee to abandon a reelection bid since the modern presidential primary process took shape in the 1970s.\n\nThese unfamiliar circumstances make it easy for observers to throw around the term \"unprecedented\" to describe what's happening, and in some respects, that word absolutely hits the mark. However, as is often the case, a longer view of American political history offers more commonalities with the current political situation than one might expect. Here then is a look at some of those past comparisons, many of which echo what we're seeing today.\n\nSeveral presidents didn't win (or seek) renomination\n\nBiden is the 13th president (of 46) to have served fewer than two terms as chief executive but not end up as his party's nominee in the ensuing presidential election.* That group consists of five presidents who won election to the White House (including Biden) and eight vice presidents who became president due to the death of their predecessor. Four of the vice presidents-turned-president did win a term in their own right but opted against seeking another four years after that. Overall, Biden is the fourth incumbent on this list to abandon some sort of reelection effort, while four others lost renomination at their party conventions, and the remaining five retired rather than run again.\n\nThe two most recent examples on this list involve incumbents who actively sought a second term before exiting the race following poor performances in early primaries. In 1968, Democratic President Lyndon Johnson had seemingly begun his reelection bid, but he surprised the country by announcing that he would not accept his party's nomination following a weak performance as a write-in candidate in the New Hampshire primary. (Behind the scenes, Johnson kept his options open about reentering the race, but that didn't pan out.) In 1952, Democratic President Harry Truman similarly announced that he wouldn't run again after losing the New Hampshire primary, although he received a handful of votes at the convention.\n\nOf course, contrary to his Democratic predecessors, Biden publicly sought renomination well beyond the spring (although both those races predate the modern primary process as we know it today). But similar to Johnson and Truman, Biden has faced low ratings for his job performance \u2014 his approval rating is only 38 percent in 538's tracker, while Johnson's stood in the mid-30s in March 1968 and Truman's the low 20s in March 1952. Interestingly, Johnson's approval rating rose sharply after his departure from the race, so we'll be watching to see if Biden gets any bump for abandoning his candidacy.\n\nThe last presidential dropout actually predates the modern two-party system. Like Johnson and Truman, Vice President John Tyler acceded to the presidency in 1841 after the president's death, in this case William Henry Harrison. Tyler had been elected as a Whig, but he was a former Democrat whose views stood sharply at odds with those of his adopted party, which quickly made him persona non grata. To retain any hope of winning the 1844 election without support from either major party, Tyler pressed the issue of annexing Texas to boost a third-party bid. But James Polk, running as the Democratic nominee, adopted much of Tyler's platform regarding Texas, which led Tyler to drop out and endorse Polk in August 1844. Polk went on to narrowly defeat Henry Clay, the Whig standard-bearer.\n\nTwo of the other vice presidents-turned-president in this table went out more on their own terms, winning and serving four more years but retiring as opposed to seeking another term. Theodore Roosevelt took office in 1901 following the assassination of Republican President William McKinley. He won a landslide victory in 1904, but said following his win that he wouldn't run in 1908 \u2014 a decision he later came to regret (Roosevelt famously ran again in 1912). Almost two decades later, Calvin Coolidge took over the White House in 1923 after Republican President Warren Harding's death and handily won the 1924 election. \"Silent Cal\" then told the press in 1927, in his famously laconic style, that \"I do not choose to run for president\" in 1928.\n\nNow, we have to go back quite a ways to find another elected president who was serving in their first term but didn't end up seeking their party's renomination at a major party convention. Nearly 150 years ago, Republican President Rutherford Hayes had made it clear that he would not seek a second term after winning the controversial 1876 election, so he didn't run in 1880. Prior to that, Democratic President James Buchanan didn't seek reelection in 1860 in the lead up to the Civil War, and Polk also retired ahead of the 1848 election. Unlike Biden, Hayes and Polk were both in their 50s at the end of their presidencies, but Buchanan was 69, about tied with Andrew Jackson as the oldest president to leave the office at that time. More broadly, exhaustion from difficult circumstances surrounding the Mexican-American War, the coming of the Civil War and a fraught contested election surely discouraged Polk, Buchanan and Hayes, respectively, from running again.\n\nThe four remaining presidents each lost out on their party's nomination at the convention after one term or less, indicative of how they struggled to garner and maintain intraparty support to a far worse extent than Biden did. Vice President Millard Fillmore acceded to the presidency after the death of President Zachary Taylor in 1850, but Fillmore lost out on the 1852 Whig Party nomination after 53 convention ballots. Democratic President Franklin Pierce easily won the 1852 election, but his actions amid growing sectional strife left him unpopular, so his party chose Buchanan over him at the 1856 convention.\n\nAs the Civil War ended, Vice President Andrew Johnson took over after the assassination of Republican President Abraham Lincoln, but he clashed with the GOP-led Congress \u2014 he'd been an anti-secession \"War Democrat\" who'd become Lincoln's running mate in 1864 \u2014 and went on to lose a bid for the Democratic nomination in 1868. In 1881, Vice President Chester Arthur succeeded the assassinated Republican President James Garfield, but Arthur fell short of the GOP nomination at the party's 1884 convention while battling kidney disease.\n\nBiden wasn't the first to face calls to step aside\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, Biden also isn't the first incumbent president who faced appeals from within his own party to abandon a reelection bid after clinching renomination in a party primary. In 1992, Republican President George H.W. Bush had turned back a primary challenge from his right flank by paleoconservative commentator Pat Buchanan and positioned himself as the GOP's presumptive nominee. But amid dissatisfaction with the economy, the mood for change seemed set against Bush. By late July, he'd fallen behind Democratic nominee Bill Clinton by double-digit margins after independent contender Ross Perot dropped out of the race.\n\nThat's when some Republican voices started calling for Bush to step aside and let someone else earn the nomination at the party's national convention in August. Editorials in notable outlets like The Orange County Register \u2014 paper of record in the long-time citadel of California Republicanism \u2014 asked Bush to \"stand down.\" GOP fundraiser Richard Viguerie, who helped develop direct mail political communication, went on CNN to call for Bush to \"follow the example\" of Truman and Johnson, which Viguerie said would \"preserve his place in history\" and \"do his party and his country a great service.\" (We heard similar statements from elected Democrats about Biden.) Beyond this, Vice President Dan Quayle also attracted similar calls, as his low approval prompted many Republicans to see him as a liability to the ticket: A former Florida state GOP chair even took out a full-page ad in The Washington Post that urged Quayle to quit the race.\n\nThe coverage of these pleas was significant enough to force a response. Although Bush ignored questions while out on the campaign trail, his campaign and allies pushed back on the idea that Bush would even consider stepping aside. Now, no members of Congress publicly called on Bush to leave the race \u2014 a major contrast to Biden \u2014 but New York Rep. Bill Green did tell reporters just two weeks before the GOP convention that Bush should replace Quayle with someone like Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (and later President George W. Bush's secretary of state).\n\nUnlike this year's push for Biden to leave the race, though, a concerted campaign to encourage Bush to drop out never took off, in part because pressure came predominantly from the party's right, which had never liked Bush much to begin with. That November, Bush ended up losing to Clinton, albeit by around 6 percentage points nationally instead of the double-digit poll margins released during the summer (in part because Perot reentered the race in the fall).\n\nThe party decides? The will of the voters? Or both?\n\nWith Biden's departure, Democrats are set to nominate a candidate who wasn't on the ballot in the presidential primary \u2014 a move by the party that some perceive as at odds with popular democracy. And not only did party leaders play a part in pushing Biden out, but they also quickly coalesced around Vice President Kamala Harris as the party's likely successor. There were likely few \"smoke-filled rooms\" this time around, given the public nature of Democrats' efforts to compel Biden's departure, and the relatively straightforward move to replace him with the sitting vice president. But American politics has a long history of party leaders putting their thumb on the scale to get their preferred choice.\n\nThe last time a party chose a standard-bearer who didn't really go before primary voters was in 1968. Vice President Hubert Humphrey announced his entry into the Democratic race in late April, about a month after the incumbent, Johnson, said he wouldn't run. Humphrey's main competitors, Sens. Robert F. Kennedy (Sr.) and Eugene McCarthy, slugged it out in the few major primaries at the time to prove their mettle to party leaders, but Humphrey captured much of their support as the establishment choice. Overall, Humphrey won just 2 percent of the primary vote \u2014 mostly as a write-in \u2014 but he easily captured a delegate majority on the convention's first ballot in an era when primaries didn't hold as much weight as they do today.\n\nYet that 1968 Democratic race precipitated reforms that brought about the modern primary system. Democrats wanted a more open and representative process that better reflected the desires of the party faithful, and their changes ahead of the 1972 election ended up having long-running ramifications for how both parties choose their nominees. Such an approach didn't necessarily have to involve more primaries \u2014 that actually wasn't the reformers' intention \u2014 but that was the result: A more voter-driven process that significantly, although not entirely, reduced the sway of party leaders.\n\nWith that in mind, some observers \u2014 including some Biden allies and many Republicans \u2014 have accused Democrats of ignoring the will of primary voters by encouraging Biden's departure. After all, Biden won about 87 percent of the vote across the 45 Democratic primary contests in 2024. That mark placed Biden in the vicinity of recent Democratic incumbents who went on to win reelection, like Bill Clinton in 1996 (88 percent) and Barack Obama in 2012 (91 percent).\n\nBut like most incumbents, Biden faced no meaningful opposition in the primary, making that contest's outcome a less useful indicator of what Democrats truly preferred. While Democrats had a positive view of Biden, their enthusiasm for him running again was never more than lukewarm. And after his woeful debate performance, many surveys found that a majority of Democrats wanted Biden to step aside. That might suggest that the party was responsive (if belatedly) to its voters' desires by encouraging Biden to leave the race \u2014 though it still doesn't guarantee that Harris would've won an open primary race.\n\nNevertheless, Biden's exit illustrates at least some remaining strength within the Democratic Party apparatus. Our current political era has been defined by weak parties that have struggled to organize and manage our politics even as strong partisanship has made things more polarized and tribal. Yet Democrats compelled Biden to leave the race, then rapidly rallied to Harris right after he stepped aside. This was a striking example of \"the party deciding,\" somewhat akin to 2020, when Democrats consolidated behind Biden ahead of Super Tuesday. In both cases, the desire to defeat Trump and the growing fear of nominating a candidate who might be unable to \u2014 Sen. Bernie Sanders in 2020, Biden in 2024 \u2014 prompted party leaders to act.\n\nFootnotes\n\n*The 22nd Amendment to the Constitution, ratified in 1951, restricts any person from being elected president more than twice and forbids any person who has acted as president for more than two years from seeking more than one additional term. However, incumbent President Harry Truman could have still run again in 1952 because the amendment did not apply to the current officeholder. George Washington set a precedent of serving no more than two terms, but there was no legal prohibition until this amendment, which was precipitated by President Franklin Roosevelt's four consecutive electoral victories.",

Vice President Joe Biden returns to the White House, after his recovery from COVID-19 . Biden, 81, dropped his reelection bid on Sunday under pressure from Democratic colleagues concerned about his frailty, mental acuity .",
        "text": "Trump, Harris trade insults in newly energized US presidential campaign\nThe race for the U.S. presidency got a jolt of new energy Tuesday, with former President Donald Trump and his newly minted Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, showing no hesitation in disparaging each other as they hurtle toward the November poll.\n\nMeanwhile in Washington, President Joe Biden quietly returned to the White House, after his recovery from COVID-19, to heightened expectations that he\u2019d use his remaining time in office to achieve foreign policy goals.\n\nTrump shifted quickly to attacking Harris after Biden, 81, dropped his reelection bid on Sunday under pressure from Democratic colleagues concerned about his frailty, mental acuity and falling poll numbers.\n\n\"Lyin' Kamala Harris destroys everything she touches!\u201d Trump, 78, said on his Truth Social platform Tuesday. Earlier, he accused her of helping cover up Biden\u2019s condition.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats lied and misled the public about Crooked Joe Biden, and now we find he is a complete and total Cognitive and Physical \u2018MESS,\u2019\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey also mislead [sic] the Republican Party, causing it to waste a great deal of time and money\u201d on political advertising targeting a candidate, Biden, who is no longer Trump\u2019s opponent.\n\nHarris, a former courtroom prosecutor in California, the country\u2019s most populous state, told a rally Tuesday that she knew the likes of Trump.\n\nIn late May, Trump was convicted of 34 felonies linked to a 2016 hush money payment he made just ahead of the election he won eight years ago. The money was paid to an adult film star to silence her claim \u2013 denied by Trump \u2013 that she had a one-night tryst with him a decade earlier.\n\nBiden, who will finish the last six months of his term, wholeheartedly endorsed Harris, his second-in-command for the past 3\u00bd years.\n\nOn Monday, he told Harris campaign workers, \u201cThe name has changed at the top of the ticket, but the mission hasn\u2019t changed at all. And by the way, I\u2019m not going anywhere. I\u2019m going to be out there on the campaign with her, with Kamala.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been honored and humbled \u2014 I mean this from the bottom of my heart, my word as a Biden \u2014 for all you\u2019ve done for me and my family,\u201d he said, while adding that now, \u201cI\u2019m hoping you\u2019ll give every bit of your heart and soul that you gave to me to Kamala,\u201d he said.\n\nBiden said he would address the nation from the White House on Wednesday evening about his decision to withdraw from the presidential race and how he plans to govern during his remaining time in office. He is the first president since Lyndon Johnson in 1968 to withdraw from a reelection campaign.\n\nWhile some Democratic officials initially thought Biden\u2019s withdrawal might lead to a contested race among several contenders for the party\u2019s presidential nomination, the most likely presidential aspirants quickly supported Harris\u2019 candidacy.\n\nBy late Monday, Harris had amassed more than enough delegates to the party\u2019s national convention, to be held August 19-22 in Chicago, to unofficially claim the nomination, although the party is holding a virtual ballot that will decide the contest even earlier, by August 7.\n\nFormer House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, still an influential Democratic strategist, endorsed Harris, as did actor George Clooney, a major Democratic fundraiser in Hollywood who two weeks ago wrote an opinion article in The New York Times calling for Biden to end his candidacy, even though Clooney in June helped stage a glitzy fundraiser for him.\n\nThe top two Democratic congressional leaders, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, endorsed Harris on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cBoy, are we enthusiastic. It\u2019s a happy day. Democrats are moving forward more united than ever before\u201d to support Harris, Schumer said.\n\nThe Harris campaign said it had raised more than $100 million from Sunday afternoon, when Biden ended his candidacy, through Monday evening.\n\nMeanwhile, Harris is mulling whom to select as her running mate, with former Attorney General Eric Holder and Washington lawyer Dana Remus beginning to vet the backgrounds of several possible choices.\n\nAmong the names surfacing in news accounts were Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, a former U.S. astronaut; and six state governors, Andy Beshear of Kentucky, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, J.B. Pritzker of Illinois, Tim Walz of Minnesota, Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania and Roy Cooper of North Carolina.\n\nHarris headed Tuesday to Milwaukee, in the political battleground state of Wisconsin, for her first campaign rally as the likely Democratic nominee.\n\nTrump, after securing the Republican presidential nomination last week, is resuming his campaign on Wednesday with a rally in the city of Charlotte, North Carolina, another contested state. Trump won the state four years ago against Biden, even as he lost the national election.\n\nIn Washington, Secretary of State Antony Blinken extolled Harris for being \u201ca leading voice for American foreign policy and for our diplomacy.\u201d\n\nBut he emphasized that Biden has a lot of work ahead of him even as Harris campaigns to take the reins.\n\n\u201cWhat he\u2019s intensely focused on is the work that remains over these next six months to continue the efforts, the work that we\u2019ve been doing, particularly trying to bring peace to the Middle East, ending the war in Gaza, putting that region on a better trajectory; continuing to deal as effectively as he has been with the ongoing aggression by Russia against Ukraine and making sure we continue to do everything we can to strengthen Ukraine; our engagement throughout the Indo-Pacific, where we have been building relationships and partnerships that are stronger than they\u2019ve ever been, whether it\u2019s with our allies \u2013 Japan, Korea, Australia, or New Zealand \u2013 whether it\u2019s with countries like the Philippines and India, or whether it\u2019s with emerging countries like Vietnam or Indonesia,\u201d Blinken said.\n\nAnalysts agreed\n\n\u201cIt's actually a fair percentage of his presidency still left, an eighth of this presidency is still left, and there continue to be real challenges, both at home in terms of lowering costs, in terms of protecting consumers from junk fees and protecting workers from terrible rules that benefit corporations and overseas,\u201d said Navin Nayak, president and executive director of the Center for American Progress Action Fund.\n\n\u201cSo trying to bring a cease-fire and peace in the Middle East, trying to continue to push back against Russia's war in Ukraine, I think the president is now squarely focused on those challenges and unburdened from the real rigors of having to also run a presidential campaign,\u201d Nayak said.\n\nAnd this situation also leaves foreign leaders in an interesting position, as Israel\u2019s prime minister is learning this week as he prepares to meet with Biden, Harris and Trump.\n\nJeremi Suri, a history professor at the University of Texas at Austin, said, \u201cI do think Biden has one problem internationally, which is that foreign leaders know he's not going to be around after a few more months, and so they're going to be hesitant to make deals with him because they know that whoever comes next \u2026 and even if it is Harris, she is likely to have her own foreign policy team and her own set of aims.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, I think foreign leaders will want to accomplish things they can get accomplished quickly with Biden because they're not sure what will happen next,\u201d Suri said.\n\nEditor's note: This story has been updated to correct former President Donald Trump's age.",

        "text": "Biden explains decision to drop out of election: \u2018Best way to unite our nation\u2019\nJoe Biden addressed the nation Wednesday to explain his historic decision to withdraw from the presidential race, delivering a reflective and hopeful message about the need to begin a new chapter in America\u2019s story.\n\n\u201cI believe my record as president, my leadership in the world, my vision for America\u2019s future all merited a second term, but nothing \u2013 nothing \u2013 can come in the way of saving our democracy. That includes personal ambition,\u201d Biden said in the Oval Office.\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019ve decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. It\u2019s the best way to unite our nation. You know, there is a time and a place for long years of experience in public life. There\u2019s also a time and a place for new voices, fresh voices \u2013 yes, younger voices. And that time and place is now.\u201d\n\nThe speech came three days after Biden stunned the country with the announcement he would abandon his presidential campaign less than four months before election day. As he contemplated the legacy of his five decades in public life, Biden pledged to keep working to better Americans\u2019 lives as he concludes his first \u2013 and now only \u2013 term as president. Some Republican lawmakers have suggested Biden should resign rather than finish out his term, but the president firmly rejected those calls on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cOver the next six months, I\u2019ll be focused on doing my job as president,\u201d he said. \u201cThat means I\u2019ll continue to lower costs for hard-working families [and] grow our economy. I\u2019ll keep defending our personal freedoms and our civil rights \u2013 from the right to vote to the right to choose.\u201d\n\nBiden specifically vowed to \u201ckeep working to end the war in Gaza, bring home all the hostages and bring peace and security to the Middle East\u201d. Hours before Biden\u2019s speech, Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, delivered a divisive address to a rare joint session of Congress in which he called for \u201ctotal victory\u201d in the war.\n\nBiden cited his own leadership on foreign policy, including his staunch support for Ukraine amid its war against Russia, as one of his proudest accomplishments. He reminded voters about the legislation he has signed to tackle the climate crisis, reduce gun violence and expand healthcare access. Harkening back to the day of his inauguration in 2021, weeks after the January 6 attack on the Capitol and less than a year into the start of the coronavirus pandemic, Biden marveled at how far the country had come in such a short time.\n\n\u201cWe were in the grip of the worst pandemic in the century, the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, the worst attack on our democracy since the civil war,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWe came together as Americans. We got through it. We emerged stronger, more prosperous and more secure.\u201d\n\nAfter withdrawing from the race on Sunday, Biden endorsed his vice-president, Kamala Harris, who has already consolidated the support of enough delegates to capture the Democratic nomination next month. In his speech, Biden reiterated his praise of Harris and underscored the immense choice facing voters this November.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to thank our great vice-president, Kamala Harris,\u201d Biden said. \u201cShe\u2019s experienced, she\u2019s tough, she\u2019s capable. She\u2019s been an incredible partner to me and a leader for our country. Now the choice is up to you, the American people.\u201d\n\nBefore Biden\u2019s announcement on Sunday, more than 30 Democratic members of Congress had called on the president to drop out of the race following his disastrous debate performance last month. In the days leading up to the announcement, polls showed an increasing number of Democrats believed Biden should step aside as Donald Trump\u2019s narrow lead in the race began to grow.\n\nEarly surveys taken since Sunday suggest a neck-and-neck race between Trump and Harris, but the vice-president already appears to be in a slightly stronger position than Biden was. Even as polls indicate a tight race, Biden expressed confidence that Americans would choose to preserve democracy this November. Quoting the Declaration of Independence and founding father Benjamin Franklin, Biden made the time-honored argument for American exceptionalism.\n\n\u201cAmerica is an idea, an idea stronger than any army, bigger than any ocean, more powerful than any dictator or tyrant. It\u2019s the most powerful idea in the history of the world,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThat idea is that we hold these truths to be self-evident. We\u2019re all created equal, endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights: life, liberty, pursuit of happiness. We\u2019ve never fully lived up to it, to this sacred idea, but we\u2019ve never walked away from it either, and I do not believe the American people will walk away from it now.\u201d\n\nIt was a message that echoed Biden\u2019s campaign slogan in 2020, which framed the election against Trump as a \u201cbattle for the soul of the nation\u201d. That battle remains ongoing, Biden said, and it will now be up to the American people to decide how it will end.\n\n\u201cThe great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule. The people do,\u201d Biden said. \u201cHistory is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America lies in your hands. You just have to keep faith \u2013 keep the faith \u2013 and remember who we are.\u201d\n\nShortly after Biden spoke, Barack Obama, under whom Biden served as vice-president for two terms, thanked him. On X, Obama quoted part of a line from the speech \u2013 \u201cThe truth, the sacred cause of this country, is larger than any one of us\u201d \u2013 and said, \u201cJoe Biden has stayed true to these words again and again over a lifetime of service to the American people.\u201d Obama has so far notably refrained from endorsing Kamala Harris as the Democratic candidate.\n\nThe House speaker emerita, Nancy Pelosi, said in a statement that Biden had shown he was on the right side of both history and the future. In a statement released after Biden\u2019s Oval Office address, she called him \u201cone of America\u2019s most consequential presidents\u201d.\n\nAnd the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, called Biden\u2019s decision to withdraw \u201ca great act of patriotism for this country you love so much\u201d.",

The Board is elected to office by educators in their respective home states.\n\n\u201cThe Biden-Harris administration has demonstrated strong support for our public schools and students. This is the type of leadership we need in Washington.

She has the experience, qualifications and dedication needed to continue delivering for students, educators and working families. She has delivered time and again for students and educators, and educators know we can count on her continued partnership in expanding access to free school meals for students, investing in student mental health, working to ensure no educator has to carry the weight of crushing student debt and, doing everything possible to keep our communities and schools safe,\u201d said President Pringle.",

        "text": "American Oversight Files Emergency Motion to Prevent Illegal Georgia State Election Board Rules from Taking Effect\nToday, nonpartisan watchdog organization American Oversight filed a motion for an interlocutory injunction and a temporary restraining order against the Georgia State Election Board (SEB) for violating the state\u2019s Open Meetings Act by holding a rushed meeting on July 12, during which it approved two controversial rules without legally required public notice or a quorum.\n\nStatement from American Oversight Interim Executive Director Chioma Chukwu:\n\n\u201cThe illegal rules approved by three rogue board members \u2014 reportedly acting at the behest of Republican Party operatives \u2014 could wreak havoc this November as anti-democratic actors seek to sway results in favor of their preferred candidates by undermining trust in our elections.\n\n\u201cWithout immediate court intervention, Georgia voters and election workers will be deprived of their right to shape rules that impact their ability to safely participate in free and fair elections. We trust the court will recognize the urgency and prevent the rules from advancing, protecting Georgians from irreparable harm.\u201d\n\nOn July 18, American Oversight filed a lawsuit against the SEB in Fulton County Superior Court seeking, among other things, injunctive and declaratory relief as well as civil penalties against board members Rick Jeffares, Janelle King, and Janice Johnston for their knowing and willful violations of the Open Meetings Act.\n\nAmerican Oversight sued following reports that Jeffares, King, and Johnston convened an illegal and last-minute meeting on July 12 to approve two controversial rule changes. The meeting was held without proper notice and quorum, and reportedly against the advice of the state attorney general\u2019s office.\n\nOne of the rules, proposed by Jeffares, requires county election boards to post daily online ballot counts on their websites. Subsequent reporting revealed that the rule text was provided to Jeffares by Georgia GOP Chairman Josh McKoon in apparent coordination with the Republican National Committee. The other rule purports to increase the number of partisan poll monitors observing ballot counting at Georgia tabulation centers, a reportedly similar version of which was also shared by the state\u2019s Republican Party.\n\nPrior to filing suit, American Oversight had sent a letter to the SEB indicating it would consider legal action if the board failed to publicly declare, within 48 hours, that its July 12 meeting violated Georgia law and that any rules approved during the meeting were invalid. The SEB has failed to respond to the letter and has not taken any steps or made any public commitment to walk back its unlawful conduct.\n\nAmerican Oversight and Atlanta-based law firm Caplan Cobb LLC are co-counsel in this case.\n\nThe complaint and the motion for preliminary injunction are available here: https://www.americanoversight.org/document/complaint-american-oversight-v-georgia-state-election-board-open-meetings-act-violation",

(Scott Olson/Getty Images)\n\nThe Pew-Knight Initiative supports new research on how Americans absorb civic information, form beliefs and identities, and engage in their communities. Pew Research Center is a nonpartisan, nonadvocacy fact tank that informs the public about the issues, attitudes and trends shaping the world. Knight Foundation is a social investor committed to supporting informed and engaged communities. Learn more >\n\nHow we did this Pew Research Center conducted this study to better understand how U.S. adults get news about local government and politics, as well as their attitudes toward this coverage. It is the second report in a series focused on local news. The survey of 5,146 U.S. adults was conducted from Jan. 22 to 28, 2024. Everyone who completed the survey is a member of the Center\u2019s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. This way nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. Read more about the ATP\u2019s methodology. Refer to the topline for the questions used for this survey, along with responses, and to the methodology for more details. This is a Pew Research Center report from the Pew-Knight Initiative, a research program funded jointly by The Pew Charitable Trusts and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation. Find related reports online at https://www.pewresearch.org/pew-knight/.\n\nThis is the second report in a series focused on local news. Read our first report, \u201cAmericans\u2019 Changing Relationship With Local News,\u201d and our third report, \u201cAmericans\u2019 Experiences With Local Crime News.\u201d\n\nAmericans want information about local government and politics. Most say they are at least somewhat interested in news about local laws and policies and local elections. And about two-thirds say they often or sometimes get local political news \u2013 higher than the shares who get news on several other local topics, including the economy and sports.\n\nBut among Americans who get news on local politics, only a quarter are highly satisfied with the quality of the news they get, according to a new Pew Research Center survey. Those who get news about weather, traffic and several other topics are more likely to be satisfied with the news they get in those areas.\n\nAmericans also do not widely see it as easy to find the news and information they need to take part in the local political process. Fewer than half of U.S. adults (45%) say it is very or somewhat easy to find the information they need to make voting decisions in local elections. By comparison, 59% say it is easy to find the information they need for presidential elections.\n\nIn both cases, much higher shares of Americans say they are at least somewhat interested in news about elections than say it is easy to find the information they need to vote.\n\nThere is virtually no difference between Democrats and Republicans (including independents who lean toward each party) in the shares who say it is easy to find the information they need to vote locally. But younger adults are less likely than those ages 50 and older to say it is easy to be an informed local voter.\n\nJump to more information on how U.S. adults view local political news.\n\nWe asked these questions to better understand how Americans get local political news at a time when many local news outlets are struggling, local news consumption habits are becoming more digital, and public attention to local news is declining. This report, the second in a series focused on local news, is part of the Pew-Knight Initiative, a research program funded jointly by The Pew Charitable Trusts and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation.\n\nOther key findings about Americans\u2019 experiences with local political news include:\n\nAmericans most often get local political news from friends and family, local news outlets, and social media\n\nU.S. adults get news about local government and politics from a variety of different sources. The most common are friends, family and neighbors (70%) and local news outlets (66%).\n\nJust over half (54%) also say they often or sometimes get news about local politics from social media.\n\nSmaller shares say they at least sometimes get local political news from local government websites (32%), local nonprofits or advocacy groups (31%), or local politicians (30%).\n\nThere are gaps between younger and older adults in some of the sources they turn to for local political news:\n\n71% of U.S. adults ages 18 to 29 get news about local government and politics from social media often or sometimes, compared with 36% of those 65 and older.\n\nConversely, Americans 65 and older are more inclined than adults under 30 to get local political news from local news outlets (75% vs. 53%) and from local politicians (39% vs. 20%).\n\nSimilar shares of older and younger adults get news about local politics from friends, family and neighbors.\n\nJump to more details about Americans\u2019 sources for local political news.\n\nAmericans are more interested in news about national politics than local politics\n\nIn general, nearly identical shares of Americans say they follow local news and national news very or somewhat closely. But when it comes to politics in particular, there is more interest in news about national politics than local politics.\n\nAmericans are more likely to say they are at least somewhat interested in presidential elections (81%) than local elections (70%). The gap is even larger when looking at the share who are extremely or very interested in presidential (54%) and local (34%) elections.\n\nU.S. adults also are more likely to say they are extremely or very interested in national laws and policies (50%) than local laws and policies (42%).\n\nThere is no significant difference between Republicans and Democrats in the shares who are at least somewhat interested in news about their local elections (73% and 71%, respectively) or local laws and policies (83% and 82%).\n\nAmericans who are more attached to their local community are more interested in and satisfied with local political news\n\nThere are clear links between Americans\u2019 sense of community attachment and their experiences with news on local government and politics. Those who feel more attached to their community have more interest in news about local laws and local elections, higher satisfaction with the quality of their local political news, and an easier time finding the information they need to vote.\n\n91% of Americans who feel very attached to their community are at least somewhat interested in news about local laws and policies, compared with 68% of those who are not very or not at all attached. A similar pattern holds for interest in news about local elections.\n\nA majority of Americans with a strong sense of community connection (61%) say it is at least somewhat easy to find the information they need to make voting decisions in local elections. Among those with little or no sense of community attachment, just 34% feel this way.\n\nAmong U.S. adults who follow news about local government and politics, four-in-ten of those with strong community attachment are extremely or very satisfied with the local political news they get \u2013 more than double the share among those who feel little or no attachment to their community (16%).\n\nCommunity attachment remains an important factor in these opinions independent of whether people are registered to vote or how closely they follow local political news.\n\nJump to more details about the link between community attachment and local political news consumption.",

        "text": "Which third-party candidates are running for president in 2024?\nAfter President Joe Biden announced he was dropping out of the presidential election and endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris, a November faceoff between former President Donald Trump and Harris is almost solidified.\n\nWhile the candidates for the two major parties are nearly locked in, a slate of third-party candidates, including independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Green Party member Jill Stein, and Libertarian Chase Oliver, is still holding on.\n\nAt the beginning of the election, nearly two dozen candidates started out in the race, but seven remain. Here are the third-party candidates running to take the White House.\n\nMore:Election live updates: Harris to make first campaign stop in battleground state\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr., the independent presidential candidate launched his campaign for the Democratic nomination in April 2023. He later dropped his Democratic bid in October and re-entered the race as an independent, calling the traditional two-party system \u201crigged\u201d for Americans.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nKennedy, an environmental lawyer and the nephew of former President John F. Kennedy is still in the process of getting on the ballot in multiple states as an independent candidate. In 2021, Kennedy was a prominent spreader of medical falsehoods and conspiracies about the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nJill Stein\n\nPhysician and environmental activist Jill Stein is not new to the presidential ballot. She ran for the White House as a member of the Green Party in both 2012 and 2016. Stein, 73, announced in November 2023 that she will be seeking the party's nomination for a third time in the 2024 election.\n\nStein, who has called for abolishing student and medical debt, received criticism from Democrats who argued that she took votes from former Secretary of State and presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election after she garnered more votes than the margin of Trump's victory in three swing states.\n\nCornell West\n\nCornell West, 71, launched his presidential campaign in June 2023 under the People's Party, but he has since announced he is running as an independent.\n\nWest is a philosopher, activist, and author who has taught at Harvard University, Yale University, Union Theological Seminary, and other institutions. He has promised to end poverty and guarantee housing and has been a vocal critic of Israel for its part in the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nChase Oliver\n\nChase Oliver, 38, is running under the Libertarian Party as the youngest presidential candidate vying for the White House in 2024.\n\nOliver, an openly gay anti-war activist, unsuccessfully ran in the 2020 special election for Georgia's 5th Congressional District and ran in a tight race for U.S. Senate in 2022. He clinched the Libertarian Party nomination over RFK Jr. and Trump.\n\nMarianne Williamson\n\nMarianne Williamson, 71, launched her White House bid in March 2023 after unsuccessfully running for president in 2020. Williamson, a self-help author and Oprah\u2019s former spiritual leader, co-founded the Peace Alliance in 2004, which aims to \u201cmobilize people into action to transform systems and public policy toward a culture of peace.\u201d\n\nWilliamson is technically still running, but she hasn't secured any delegates in state primaries and will likely not receive the Democratic nomination in August",

        "text": "Running for US president is a costly business\nIn a new article for The Conversation, Steven Daniels, Lecturer in Law and Politics at Edge Hill University, looks at the rules governing the finances of standing as a US presidential candidate\n\nIt costs a lot of money to become president of the United States. The 2020 presidential election cycle involved campaign expenditure of US$14 billion (\u00a311 billion) \u2013 an amount that will almost certainly be beaten in November 2024.\n\nBy Sunday 2 June, and after a buoyant Republican National Convention at which he was endorsed as the party\u2019s candidate for the November election, data recorded by the US Federal Election Commission (FEC) had challenger Donald Trump leading incumbent president Joe Biden in the fundraising stakes by $757 million to $746 million. This reflected a surge in the second quarter of the year in which Trump had outdone Biden by nearly $100 million.\n\nBut then, after weeks of speculation following a lacklustre debate performance in June and a series of gaffe-laden public appearances, Biden announced he would not seek re-election. Instead he endorsed his vice-president, Kamala Harris.\n\nBy that evening it was reported that Harris had already raised more than $46 million. The following day, The New York Times reported that Harris had raised $81 million in the first 24 hours since announcing her presidential bid.\n\nThe sudden change of presidential nominee has required fundraising groups that previously supported the Biden-Harris ticket to pivot to Harris, a process which isn\u2019t as simple as it sounds. For example, the Haley Voters for Biden Political Action Committee (PAC) has had to rebrand to Haley Voters for Harris.\n\nPACs must be registered with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) in order to spend on behalf of their candidate \u2013 hence the rush, in case the money raised in Biden\u2019s original name is not allowed to be used to support Harris\u2019s candidacy.\n\nComplex system\n\nThe complex US political funding and financing system can often be very confusing. Federal laws aim to set limits on funding both for presidential campaigns and for politicians running for Congress. But the reality is very different, and as a result, money flows from multiple directions.\n\nWhile an individual can only directly donate a maximum of $3,300 to a federal candidate, numerous other avenues to donate exist, and an individual could ultimately spend as much as $123,500 on a candidate per two-year election cycle. But this amount is just the formal spending limit.\n\nUS electoral law attempts to formalise the amount of money a presidential candidate can receive and spend. But almost every attempt at legislating to control funding is subsequently found to contain a loophole.\n\nEven within this patchy legal environment, anyone wanting to lobby or otherwise influence a presidential candidate had a range of other ways of getting money to them, principally through the use of tax-exempt PACs.\n\nPACS and Super PACs\n\nPACs have existed since 1943. A PAC is set up by a business, labour union or pressure groups in order to fund a candidate. They can\u2019t take money directly from businesses or unions, but they can accept donations from individuals, up to $5,000 per year. They are allowed to give $5,000 to individual politicians and $15,000 a year to political parties. They can also spend an unlimited amount on political advertising, as long as it is not directly linked to a candidate. There is a limit to how many \u201cVote Harris\u201d ads it can buy, but none on \u201cVote for fair abortion laws\u201d, for example.\n\nSuper PACs were created by a Supreme Court judgment in 2010: Citizens United v FEC (2010). The case involved a conservative non-profit group called Citizens United which had made a film, Hillary the Movie, critical of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. The FEC ruled that it amounted to unlawful electioneering content and prevented it being shown on cable before the 2008 primaries.\n\nThe case ended up before the Supreme Court, which ruled that this was in conflict with the First Amendment right to free speech. The effective result of this judgment allowed Super PACS to raise and spend unlimited funds, provided they do not contribute directly towards a candidate\u2019s campaign \u2013 they often get around this by spending the money on advertising, for example.\n\nThese are effective money-earning organisations: the pro-Biden Future Forward USA raised $150 million ahead of the 2020 election.\n\nSuch astronomical sums often lend themselves to suggestions of lobbying, or undue influence by large donors over candidates. Lobbying is regulated by the Lobbying Disclosure Act 1995. This requires lobbyists to register with Congress. It also specifies how money can be spent.\n\nThe Honest Leadership and Open Government Act 2007 strengthened the 1995 Act by tightening rules on public disclosure. But it hasn\u2019t stopped wealthy lobbying groups (or individuals) from simply donating through other avenues, such as Super PACs, as the act specifies only those directly lobbying members of the executive or legislature must register.\n\nThis can be seen in the donations made by, for example, the Koch family: their Americans for Prosperity Action group spent nearly $500 million in the 2020 election cycle alone on Republican candidates and causes.\n\nThis can make it difficult for smaller candidates to break through. But yet progress is being made. Bernie Sanders raised nearly $180 million in his 2020 presidential bid through online crowdfunding, from voters who tended to be younger, more working class, or otherwise felt disenfranchised.\n\nThese tactics were adapted and advanced by more mainstream candidates. In his 2020 campaign, Biden raised $656.8 million in contributions of $200 or under, and Trump $483.9 million. Trump has also become adept at selling merchandise in order to fill his campaign coffers, such as raising over $7 million through selling t-shirts featuring his Fulton County Jail mugshot, suggesting campaigns are constantly finding new ways to raise cash.\n\nSpending will undoubtedly ratchet up as November moves closer, and candidates find themselves with multiple avenues to attract funding. In the end, $14 billion may ultimately be a drop in the ocean, given the stakes and importance of this election. Both Trump and Harris will find themselves in need of every cent they can attract, direct or indirect.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

        "text": "Middle East Leaders Prefer Trump\u2019s Victory\nDonald J. Trump\u2019s candidacy seems to draw more interest and support from the Middle East than from other areas of the world, particularly from among the ruling elite in influential countries like Israel and in Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries. Saudi support for Trump may not be surprising given that current US President Joe Biden was sharply critical of Riyadh during his 2020 presidential election campaign, slights that the Saudi leadership has not forgotten. But Joe Biden\u2019s low poll numbers in Israel are indeed a surprise given his tight embrace of the country following the October 7 Hamas attack and his substantial support for Israel\u2019s ongoing campaign in the Gaza Strip. The Democratic Party, especially its progressive wing, has become much more critical of Israel than the Republicans, and any Democratic nominee who will replace Biden\u2014such as Vice President Kamala Harris\u2014is not likely to change this dynamic and may even wind up boosting Trump\u2019s standing there.\n\nOther states in the region, such as Bahrain, Egypt, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) may also be more supportive of Trump than a Democratic nominee but are keeping their cards close to their chests. Their support derives at least partly from an expectation that as in Trump\u2019s 2017-2021 presidency, a second Trump administration would pay little attention to sensitive issues like human rights. They also believe that Trump, with his unusual style of diplomacy, may be able to end the war in Gaza\u2014something that the Biden administration has not been able to do.\n\nCultivating the Saudis\n\nThe Saudis undoubtedly remember with nostalgia that Trump chose their country as the first foreign state he visited as president. They did have misgivings about him during the 2016 campaign when he railed against immigrants from Muslim majority countries and then banned their entry to the United States soon after taking office. But Saudis received Trump\u2019s May 2017 speech in Riyadh well, as he assured them and other assembled leaders of Arab and Muslim countries that he would not pressure them to democratize. He stated,\n\nOur partnerships will advance security through stability, not through radical disruption. We will make decisions based on real-world outcomes \u2013 not inflexible ideology\u2026 And, wherever possible, we will seek gradual reforms \u2013 not sudden intervention. We must seek partners, not perfection\u2014and to make allies of all who share our goals.\n\nTrump also touted the substantial economic links between Saudi Arabia and the United States. He emphasized that he had just signed \u201chistoric agreements with the Kingdom that will invest almost $400 billion in our two countries and create many thousands of jobs in America and Saudi Arabia,\u201d although much of this amount was part of previous deals.\n\nTrump continued this transactional foreign policy when he hosted Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman (MBS) in the White House in March 2018. In front of cameras, Trump displayed a large chart that supposedly showed Saudi purchases of US military items as if business and diplomacy were essentially the same thing. In addition, MBS\n\ncultivated a friendship with Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, whom Trump put in charge of Arab-Israeli peacemaking. Saudi Arabia did not formally endorse Trump\u2019s so called \u201cpeace plan\u201d for Israel and the Palestinians (which heavily favored the former), or the later Abraham Accords, in which Bahrain, Morocco, Sudan, and the UAE established diplomatic relations with Israel. But it is believed that MBS approved Bahrain\u2019s decision to join the Accords.\n\nTrump played a crucial role in trying to protect MBS in the wake of the gruesome murder of Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nFor his part, Trump played a crucial role in trying to protect MBS in the wake of the gruesome murder of Saudi dissident and US resident Jamal Khashoggi in October 2018 at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Although the Central Intelligence Agency assessed that MBS was responsible for ordering the murder, Trump made equivocal public statements about the crown prince\u2019s role. Trump also supported the Saudi role in the Yemen war, restoring US munitions that had been held up by the Obama administration and vetoing legislation that aimed to end US support for the Saudi military campaign.\n\nThat Trump did not hide his belief that he would likely run again in 2024 may have influenced MBS\u2019s position to override the doubts of Saudi investment experts in 2021 and place $2 billion of Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth in a new investment firm started by Kushner, who lacked experience in running such a venture. MBS is clearly banking (literally and figuratively) on a new Trump administration. In March 2024, with Republican Senator Lindsey Graham acting as conduit, Trump and MBS held a very friendly phone call with Trump reportedly touting his poll numbers to the de-facto Saudi leader.\n\nBiden\u2019s Pullout from the Race Will Not Alter the Saudi View\n\nAlthough at the moment it appears clear that Biden\u2019s replacement as Democratic nominee will be Vice President Harris, the Saudis will still likely prefer Trump. When Biden made the comment during his 2020 campaign that he would treat Saudi Arabia as a \u201cpariah,\u201d he did not get any pushback from his fellow Democrats (including Harris). Indeed, when Biden decided to visit Saudi Arabia in 2022\u2014largely to try to persuade the Saudis to produce more oil to address the fallout from Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine on energy prices\u2014he felt compelled to publish an op-ed in the Washington Post to justify his visit. Speaking largely to his fellow Democrats, he said, \u201cI know that there are many who disagree with my decision to travel to Saudi Arabia. My views on human rights are clear and long-standing\u2026\u201d He also reminded his readers that his administration \u201creversed the blank-check policy we inherited,\u201d citing his release of the intelligence community\u2019s report on the Khashoggi murder, sanctions on the Saudi unit involved in his killing, and visa bans on Saudi officials involved in harassing Saudi dissidents abroad.\n\nThe irony of these statements is that after the visit, the Biden administration immediately placed the Saudi human rights issue on the back burner. Although the Biden team was critical of many of Trump\u2019s policies, it hoped to build on the Abraham Accords as a way of achieving a diplomatic \u2018win\u2019 in the Middle East, especially after the disastrous US withdrawal from Afghanistan. In addition, with Israeli-Palestinian peace-making frozen, the administration hoped that inducing the Saudis to join the Abraham Accords would be a game-changer. However, this prospect became more complicated as the Saudis reportedly demanded a NATO-like security pact with Washington and US support for a Saudi civilian nuclear program as the price for normalizing relations with Israel.\n\nThe Biden team hoped to build on the Abraham Accords as a way of achieving a diplomatic \u2018win\u2019 in the Middle East\n\nThe war in Gaza has further complicated US-Saudi relations, as the Biden administration has tried to enlist Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states in a post-war reconstruction plan that would entail billions of dollars on their part. But until the war ends and the Israelis agree to return Gaza to Palestinian control (which they have refused to do), Riyadh and other Gulf capitals remain reticent. Saudi officials today may be happier with the Biden team than they once were, given its numerous visits to the kingdom in recent months, but they still seem more comfortable with Trump.\n\nIn addition to the Saudis\u2019 large investment gift to Kushner, the Trump family has been busy securing large business deals in Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries. Trump\u2019s son Eric recently told the Financial Times that not only will the Trump organization be involved in developing a Trump tower in Jeddah, it will also partner with the Saudi real estate firm Dar Global in building a luxury resort and golf course in Oman. Already, the Trump organization operates a luxury golf course in Dubai in the UAE. Eric Trump implied that these deals were not a conflict of interest because \u201cI don\u2019t really deal with foreign governments,\u201d but this practice of mixing business with government is not new for Trump, nor for the Gulf states. The group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington reported that from December 2016 (soon after Trump was elected) to February 2017, Saudi lobbyists paid for about 500 rooms, worth $270,000, at Trump\u2019s Washington, DC hotel, and that when MBS visited New York in 2018, his entourage stayed at the Trump International Hotel in Manhattan, spiking the venue\u2019s revenue by 13 percent. As for the UAE, it spent up to $10,000 per night for rooms at the Trump Washington, DC hotel from late 2017 to mid-2018.\n\nTrump Still Popular in Israel\n\nDuring his presidency, Trump became very popular in Israel for his many gifts to the government. These included recognizing Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital and moving the US Embassy to that city, recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Syrian Golan Heights, closing the US Consulate General in Jerusalem that mainly served the Palestinian community, and closing the PLO office in Washington. Trump\u2019s moves were so well received in Israel\u2014even outside of right-wing factions\u2014that during his 2019 election campaign Netanyahu produced giant billboards of Trump and him smiling together. But when Netanyahu congratulated Biden for winning the 2020 US presidential race, Trump took umbrage, and his relations with Netanyahu soured.\n\nAs is known, days after October 7, Biden flew to Israel where he not only embraced its leaders and met with relatives of the Hamas hostages, but even met with the Israeli war cabinet, reflecting his longstanding and deep Zionist beliefs. These acts as well as his advocacy for more military assistance to Israel, which Congress eventually passed, initially boosted Biden\u2019s standing in Israel. As the war in Gaza dragged on, however, and Palestinian civilian deaths mounted, Biden became more critical of Israel\u2019s military campaign, calling it \u201cover the top,\u201d and he pressed Israel to allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza. These comments, and the short hold-up of 500-pound bombs to Israel (2,000 pound bombs are still under review), may have helped to turn many Israelis against Biden, which was evident in a May poll in Israel that found that 43 percent of Israelis supported Trump and just 32 percent backed Biden.\n\nTrump\u2019s moves were so well received in Israel that Netanyahu produced giant billboards of Trump and him smiling together.\n\nFar-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir called on Netanyahu not to approve a Gaza cease-fire/hostage deal because he did not want to give Biden a win prior to the US election. Although Biden\u2019s July 21 announcement that he would not run again has made this argument moot, and Ben-Gvir was criticized by Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party for suggesting it, indications are that Netanyahu prefers Trump and hopes to rekindle his close relationship with him. That Harris has exhibited a slightly different approach regarding the Israeli military campaign in the Gaza Strip only reinforces the notion that the Israeli leader is rooting for a Trump win.\n\nBoth Trump and his running mate, Senator J.D. Vance of Ohio, have opposed any restrictions on or criticisms of US support for Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, though Trump has said that Israel needs to get the war against Hamas \u201cover with fast.\u201d\n\nOther Countries in Silent Mode but Hoping for a Trump Win\n\nSeveral Arab countries that have longstanding ties to the United States, namely Egypt, the UAE, and Bahrain, have been more circumspect about the US presidential race, but are also likely quietly rooting for Trump. This is due in large part to the Democrats\u2019 rare criticism of the human rights situation in Arab authoritarian states and to the punitive measures that Democratic administrations have sometimes imposed on such countries for their abuses of the opposition.\n\nFor example, during the 2020 campaign, Biden tweeted that there would be \u201cno more blank checks for Trump\u2019s favorite dictator,\u201d Egypt\u2019s ruler Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, and once in office, he held up a portion ($130 million) of military aid to Cairo partly in response to US congressional pressure (largely coming from Democrats) over human rights. By contrast, Trump called Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi a \u201cfantastic guy\u201d in 2016 and later received him in the White House, which Biden has not done. But because the United States needs Cairo\u2019s help to resolve the war in Gaza, the Biden administration has dropped its public criticism of Egypt, and Biden himself has held several phone calls with Sisi on the Gaza situation. Nonetheless, Sisi and his government probably yearn for another Trump administration where their repression would not come under scrutiny. Similarly, Bahrain, ever since the 2011 crackdown, has occasionally been criticized by Democratic administrations, whereas Trump, in his last full day as president in January 2021, bestowed the Legion of Merit, Degree Chief Commander, on Bahraini King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa. And under Democratic administrations, the UAE has been subjected to criticism over allegations of \u201cfacilitating Russian economic activity\u201d and its role in the Yemen war, whereas the country seems to be a favorite of Trump and his family\u2019s business.\n\nThe Arab leader who may miss Biden the most is Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah, who has long had a friendly relationship with the US president. The Jordanian monarch believed Trump was overly indulgent of Netanyahu and opposed the Trump peace plan. If Trump were to win the presidency again, however, the king will try to reach an accommodation with him, as too much is at stake for Jordan if the Israeli-Palestinian situation remains unresolved.\n\nPreferences, and a Waiting Period\n\nGiven the unpredictable nature of the 2024 presidential election, Middle East leaders would do well to hedge their bets and avoid throwing their lot in with Trump prematurely. Kamala Harris appears to have secured the support of a majority of Democratic delegates to the Democratic National Convention in Chicago next August and is expected to win the nomination. If she ends up winning the presidential race in November, these leaders will not only have to deal with a Democratic president who is close to Joe Biden and is likely to continue his policies, but also to work with America\u2019s first female president. The next few months will obviously be pivotal for both Trump and Harris as they navigate the presidential campaign, but they also provide Middle East leaders with an opportunity to critically evaluate how the two may or may not help them serve their countries\u2019 best national interests.\n\nThe views expressed in this publication are the author\u2019s own and do not necessarily reflect the position of Arab Center Washington DC, its staff, or its Board of Directors.\n\nFeatured image credit: SPA",

        "summary": " How Harris and Trump differ on tech policy: How a President Harris and a re-elected President Trump would differ on major tech policy issues . We compare views on Biden\u2019s AI Executive Order, antitrust enforcement, taxes, racial/gender biases, cryptocurrency regulation, and digital equity .",
        "text": "How Harris and Trump differ on tech policy\nPresident Joe Biden\u2019s decision to withdraw from the 2024 presidential campaign and endorse Vice President Kamala Harris upends the contest and alters its policy and strategic dynamics. It pits a younger Democrat against an older Republican, a woman of color campaigning against a white man, and a former prosecutor from California versus a New York/Florida billionaire.\n\nIn this blog, we compare how a President Harris and a re-elected President Trump would differ on major tech policy issues. In particular, we compare their views on Biden\u2019s artificial intelligence (AI) Executive Order, antitrust enforcement, taxes, racial/gender biases, cryptocurrency regulation, and digital equity. There is a vast gulf in how each leader would handle these pressing tech matters and what they would do to shape the future of digital technologies.\n\nBiden\u2019s AI Executive Order\n\nOne of the hallmarks of Biden\u2019s technology agenda was an ambitious executive order calling for greater public oversight and regulation of AI. AI is the transformative technology of our time, seeing implementation in virtually every sector. As such, President Biden issued an executive order, which called for every federal agency to examine the impacts of AI in its specific sector and the avenues for addressing its problems. He gave agencies several months to review their AI usage and oversight, with deliverables due sometime in December 2024.\n\nFormer President Trump\u2019s platform seeks to repeal the executive order, while a President Harris likely would keep it. In general, Trump supports a lighter regulatory touch on AI and other emerging technologies. In his initial term, very little news was generated around AI regulation.\n\nIn contrast, Harris understands the way AI is transforming communications and service delivery, and the need for public oversight. She likely would extend Biden\u2019s executive order and urge Congress to pass legislation that would codify greater protections to promote consumer privacy, cybersecurity, and human safety. She might also encourage the federal government to use its procurement power to make sure agencies provide appropriate guardrails for their AI use.\n\nAntitrust enforcement\n\nA President Harris would likely continue Biden\u2019s tough antitrust enforcement. She has talked repeatedly about the need to reduce inflation and improve economic opportunity for all Americans. The administration has gone after large platforms, which they feel have abused their strong market positions and engaged in predatory behavior that has harmed consumers and made it harder for people to buy necessary goods.\n\nTrump probably would not be as vigorous at anti-trust enforcement as Biden and Harris have been. He might continue current tech antitrust enforcement cases but would give a green light to tech mergers and acquisitions. His business background makes him generally more sympathetic to the business community, and he is unlikely to appoint strong enforcers to the Department of Justice, Federal Trade Commission, or Federal Communications Commission. That was the case in his first term as president and likely would continue if he wins another term as chief executive.\n\nTech billionaire taxes\n\nTrump has indicated he wants to extend his 2017 tax cuts when they expire in 2025 and cut income and corporate taxes even further. Even though a considerable amount of his earlier tax cuts went to rich individuals and wealthy corporations, his tax cut plans likely will continue those trends and push cuts in those directions.\n\nHarris likely will continue Biden\u2019s avoidance of income tax increases for those earning less than $400,000. But like President Biden, she wants to raise taxes on the ultra-wealthy on grounds they need to pay their fair share. Those tax increases would help pay for needed services for less-fortunate people.\n\nRacial/gender biases\n\nThere are well-documented racial and gender biases in AI that need to be taken seriously. Trump does not have a track record of supporting strong bias mitigation efforts, especially for racial bias, or of appointing regulators who take tough action in these areas. He has made many dubious claims in this area, most recently using the term \u201cBlack jobs\u201c in the last debate\u2014a term for which no one still has ascertained the meaning. In fact, he has been part of a swarm of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) critics that have condemned the use of race in college admissions on the grounds that such preferences no longer are warranted.\n\nHarris, in contrast, has a record of fighting racial and gender biases and supporting effective enforcement actions against those who violate basic rights. She has fought for anti-discrimination action in housing and wealth creation and has spoken clearly on the importance of effective government action. Her focus on these issues will likely continue as she forms a more pro-consumer, tech policy agenda.\n\nCryptocurrency regulation\n\nThe two candidates differ considerably regarding cryptocurrency regulation. Although Trump previously supported tough regulation against cryptocurrencies, he has recently moderated his position and advocated for a lighter approach. His view appears to be that crypto is an innovation that requires some time to work out and does not require tough oversight at this point.\n\nUnlike her Republican opponent, Harris has a tougher stance on cryptocurrency regulation. She thinks consumers need adequate protection and there should be greater transparency in the crypto marketplace. Administration appointments already have called for tougher U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) enforcement against cryptocurrency firms.\n\nDigital equity\n\nIn her new book, \u201cDigitally Invisible: How the Internet is Creating the New Underclass,\u201d Nicol Turner Lee argues that who gets into office often determines the scope of national tech policy, especially when it comes to the rewards for industry and communities. During his administration, Trump upended all of Obama\u2019s policies from data privacy to school connectivity, including those connecting the nation\u2019s schools to the internet. However, Trump did advance policies for more robust 5G wireless infrastructure, especially in rural communities.\n\nUnder the Biden-Harris administration, the largest allotment of funds has been allocated toward national broadband infrastructure under any administration, and federal agencies are steep into getting states the funds to launch their approved projects. If history is a dictate, Trump will halt all those programs and attempt to recoup the funds, while Harris would stay committed to bringing broadband to all communities.\n\nWith the election more than three months away, it\u2019s still too early to tell how each candidate will fare. But what is expected of Harris, assuming she secures the Democratic nomination, is that she will continue many of the tech policies of the Biden administration and stay that course as president if she were to win.",

The picture on the other side changed considerably with Biden\u2019s withdrawal from the race.\n\nWhile it remains to be seen if Harris prevails as the Democratic nominee, the presidential election remains a race of stark contrasts, leaving Canadians to wonder how their country will be affected by the results.\n\nWhat impact would a second Trump term have on Canada, America, and the globe?\n\nDuring Trump\u2019s previous four-year term, Canadian opinions of the United States declined considerably on a number of fronts. They were much less likely to describe the United States as \u201ca valuable friend and ally to Canada\u201d, \u201ca positive player in world affairs\u201d, or a \u201cprogressive society\u201d in 2020 than they were in 2016.\n\nRelated: Better with Biden? President-elect restores hope among Canadians for an improved relationship with U.S.\n\nLike all summer blockbusters, the 2024 sequel to 2016 is just as dramatic. With a potential second Trump term looming, Canadians are worried again. Majorities believe another four years of Trump will have negative effects on global peace and stability (68%), progress in reducing greenhouse gases (67%), America\u2019s unity (67%), the overall Canada-U.S. relationship (65%) and the Canadian economy (60%). On three of those factors \u2013 bringing America together, global peace, and fighting climate change \u2013 more than two-in-five Canadians believe a second Trump term will have \u201cvery negative\u201d impacts:\n\nThere is some disagreement across the political divide in this country on prospect for Trump retaking power. Few likely Liberal, NDP or Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois voters believe a Trump victory come November would have a positive effect on any of the factors canvassed.\n\nHowever, there is a sizable portion of the current CPC voting base who disagree. More than two-in-five of those who would vote CPC if an election were held today say they believe Trump\u2019s second term would have a positive impact on global stability. Approaching two-in-five (37%) say four more years of Trump would bring America closer together. There are also more than one-third (36%) of current CPC voters who believe Canada\u2019s relationship with the U.S. would benefit if Trump won the presidential election:\n\nA Trump win viewed as bad or terrible for Canada by most\n\nFewer than one-in-six (15%) Canadians would celebrate a Trump win in November\u2019s election as \u201cgood\u201d (9%) or \u201cexcellent\u201d (6%) news for Canada. Many more would call it \u201cterrible\u201d (38%) or \u201cbad\u201d (28%).\n\nLikely Liberal, NDP and BQ voters are much more likely to be in the latter group. Those who would vote CPC if an election were held today are more divided. Approaching two-in-five (37%) believe a new Trump administration would be \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cexcellent news\u201d for Canada, while nearly as many (34%) say it would \u201cbad\u201d or \u201cterrible\u201d:\n\nPart Two: Policy ramifications\n\nThe recently concluded Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisc. provided significant insight into the policy priorities of the Trump campaign. Many have been key talking points for Trump as he has travelled throughout the country and given speeches at rallies to his supporters.\n\nImmigration\n\nThe border and migrant crisis at America\u2019s southern border with Mexico has been a focal point for Trump and addressing it is a key pillar of the 2024 Republican Party Platform. Trump has said he plans to \u201cclose (the United States\u2019) borders\u201d and carry out a \u201cmass deportation\u201d that he says will be the largest such effort in American history.\n\nCanada would certainly be impacted by its southern neighbours\u2019 immigration policy, which could potentially lead to more asylum seekers heading further north. Three-quarters (74%) of Canadians say they would prefer Canada \u201ctake the necessary measures\u201d to prevent an influx of new refugees. One-quarter (26%) say instead Canada should welcome more migrants. Likely NDP voters are the only group of political supporters who prefer the latter at a majority level (53%):\n\nNATO spending\n\nDefence spending has become a pain point in the Canada-U.S. relationship even under Biden as Canada continues to underspend the two per cent of GDP it had agreed to as a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) member. Trump will likely intensify that pain point, as he has said he would \u201cencourage (the Russians) to do whatever the hell they want\u201d with NATO members who fell short of their spending commitments. At the recent NATO conference in Washington, D.C., Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the country would reach the two per cent target by 2032 without detailing specifically how Canada would achieve that. It remains to be seen if this timeline would be enough to placate Trump.\n\nCanadians are divided evenly on whether a Trump win should accelerate Canada\u2019s defence spending plans.\n\nNotably, likely CPC voters are much more likely to believe Canada should accelerate its plan to hit the NATO defence spending target, which stands in contrast to Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre\u2019s statements on the issue. Poilievre would not commit to hitting the two per cent defence spending target if he were to become prime minister in comments made in the wake of the NATO conference earlier in July, saying Canada \u201cis broke\u201d and he needs to make sure any financial commitments he makes are properly costed.\n\nUkraine\n\nTrump and the Republican party\u2019s stance on the war in Ukraine also is a stark departure from the current administration\u2019s policies. Trump has vowed to end the war quickly if he wins in November, which potentially would involve suspending military aid to Kyiv unless it began peace negotiations with Russia. This could also set the battlelines as they are, which would likely involve Ukraine surrendering territory Russia has occupied.\n\nIf Trump were elected to a second term and he follows this path on Ukraine he has been signalling during the campaign, one-third (33%) of Canadians would want Canada to follow and urge Ukraine to negotiate for peace even if it meant surrendering territories. Two-thirds (67%) would prefer Canada continue to strongly support the Ukraine if the Americans stopped military aid, even if it meant Canada providing more financial support to help make up the gap.\n\nThe Canadian political divide that has been evident on the Ukraine war in recent months is also on display here. Overwhelming majorities of likely Liberal, NDP and BQ voters prefer Canada to continue supporting and even boost aid to Ukraine in the wake of a Trump withdrawal. CPC supporters are more divided:\n\nSupply Management\n\nCanada\u2019s system of supply management, which protects Canada\u2019s dairy, poultry and eggs industries through production and import controls and pricing mechanisms, proved to be a major sticking point when Canada sat down at the table with Mexico and the United States to draft the replacement agreement for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) under the previous Trump administration. To pass the replacement deal, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA or CUSMA), Canada agreed to open up a percentage of its market to American dairy, a move which was heavily criticized by Canada\u2019s dairy farmers.\n\nRelated:\n\nUSMCA is up for review in 2026, which means the next president of the U.S. will have a significant influence on how the negotiations will proceed. Biden\u2019s top trade official has warned that the U.S. will push for changes, signalling it could be a contentious negotiation regardless of whether the Democratic nominee or Trump win the election in the fall.\n\nCanadians lean towards protecting supply management in these upcoming negotiations, but 45 per cent prefer Canada making some sacrifices of the supply management system if it means smoother negotiations with our North American partners. Likely CPC voters are the only group of political supporters to hold the latter as a majority opinion (62%):\n\nKeystone XL\n\nOne of Biden\u2019s first acts when he took office in 2021 was to kill Keystone XL, a controversial pipeline project which lingered for years in limbo before Trump signed a presidential memorandum to build it in 2017. The project may get another look if Trump is re-elected as president. Notably, TC Energy, formerly TransCanada Corporation, the project\u2019s owner, was a sponsor of the recent Republican National Convention.\n\nCanadians are more likely to believe Keystone XL\u2019s revival would be a good thing (46%) than a bad one (34%). Those in Alberta (67%) and Saskatchewan (64%) are more likely to cheer the return of Keystone XL, while only those in Quebec are more likely to think it would be a bad thing (46%) than a good one (29%):\n\nPart Three: Canadian political angles\n\nPoilievre trusted more than Trudeau to handle trade, but low confidence overall\n\nCanada\u2019s own near-term political future is murky. An election must take place by October 2025 and Canada\u2019s incumbent minority government is trailing badly in current vote intentions.\n\nCanadians are more likely to say Poilievre (32%) would get a stronger new trade deal than the incumbent Trudeau (20%), but there is little confidence in either leader. As many say neither is a good option on this front (32%) as select Poilievre.\n\nThe Conservative leader outperforms Trudeau greatly among men older than 34, while women are near evenly split between both party leaders and believe neither is a good choice at a plurality level:\n\nWould Trump win change voters\u2019 decision in Canada?\n\nA second Trump term evidently presents both a potential sea change in policy south of the border, as well as challenge for Canada\u2019s relationship with its neighbour, regardless of who is prime minister. The sense among a plurality of Canadians is that a second Trump term would not affect their vote (see detailed tables). However, there is some movement among those whose support is more \u201csoft\u201d than \u201cfirm\u201d, i.e. those who are not fully committed to their current vote intention.\n\nSoft NDP supporters are more likely than not to say they could support the Liberals in the event Trump wins re-election. For most non-fully committed voters, it appears a second Trump term would further entrench their current leanings:",

        "text": "July 25, 2024, presidential campaign news\nVice President Kamala Harris speaks at a campaign rally in West Allis, Wisconsin, on July 23. Jim Vondruska/Getty Images\n\nThe likely 2024 presidential election campaign between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump begins with no clear leader, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS.\n\nTrump holds 49% support among registered voters nationwide to Harris\u2019 46%, a finding within the poll\u2019s margin of sampling error. That\u2019s a closer contest than earlier CNN polling this year had found on the matchup between Biden and Trump.\n\nThe survey finds voters widely supportive of both Biden\u2019s decision to step aside and his choice to remain in office through the end of his term. Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters are broadly enthusiastic about Harris and willing to coalesce around her as the new presumptive nominee, even as they remain deeply divided on whether Biden\u2019s Democratic successor should seek to continue his policies or chart a new course.\n\nThe poll, conducted online July 22 and 23, surveyed registered voters who had previously participated in CNN surveys in April or June, both of which found Trump leading Biden by 6 points in a head-to-head matchup. Checking back in with the same people means that shifts in preferences are more likely to reflect real changes over time and not just statistical noise.\n\nAnd the new poll finds some critical movement in these early days of a Harris-Trump race.\n\nHarris hangs on to 95% of those who earlier said they supported Biden, while Trump retains the support of a slightly smaller 92% of his previous backers. Those who previously said they would support neither Biden nor Trump in a two-way matchup now split 30% for Harris and 27% for Trump, with the rest saying they\u2019d vote for someone else or opt out of this year\u2019s election.\n\nHalf of those who back Harris in the new poll (50%) say their vote is more in support of her than against Trump. That\u2019s a dramatic shift compared with the Trump-focused dynamic of the Biden-Trump race. Among Biden\u2019s supporters in CNN\u2019s June poll, just 37% said their vote was mainly to express support for the president.\n\nAbout three-quarters of Trump\u2019s supporters (74%) say their vote is to express support for him rather than opposition to Harris. That\u2019s an increase in affirmative support for him compared with the June CNN poll (66%), which came before an assassination attempt on Trump\u2019s life and the Republican National Convention at which the former president formally accepted his party\u2019s nomination.\n\nThe poll finds Trump\u2019s favorability rating ticking up to 43%, higher than it\u2019s been since 2020 in CNN polling.\n\nRead more about the new CNN poll.",

        "text": "The Role of Health Care in the New Presidential Election\nThere is no Clinton health reform plan or (then) controversial Obamacare plan to command the attention of voters in this presidential election. Former President Trump will focus on other issues he views as advantageous\u2014not health care\u2014and Vice President Harris is unlikely to make new health proposals of her own. Nevertheless, health is likely to be a consequential factor in the campaign. Here\u2019s how.\n\nFirst and foremost, it will be a campaign weapon for the vice president. That starts (and has already started) with abortion and reproductive rights. Vice President Harris will try to rally the Democratic base and appeal to younger voters and women, arguing that former President Trump will sign a national ban on abortion and has selected a running mate with extreme views on women and reproductive freedom. This is not news, but it is the main role health will play in the presidential election.\n\nFrom there, expect Vice President Harris to attempt to tie former President Trump to a long list of proposals made by various conservative groups that support him to roll back public programs and insurance coverage. These include plans that would dilute protections for pre-existing conditions, let enhanced ACA subsidies lapse, transform Medicare into a voucher-like program, place a time limit on Medicaid eligibility, and severely cut and cap Medicaid and hand it off to the states. How far Vice President Harris goes down this list remains to be seen, and which items on the list are emphasized may depend on which audiences she is engaging. Her selection for vice president could also influence these choices. These policy ideas may have some appeal to the conservative Republican base, but polling shows they are unpopular with the general public. Many of these issues could have traction down ballot as well, but that\u2019s a different subject for another day.\n\nFormer President Trump and Republicans have their own issues on which they have similar advantages, including immigration and inflation, and they are already pushing them. (This is a political analysis, and no judgement is intended here about the merits of claims made by either side, or the techniques used to make them).\n\nThe Democratic advantage on health is about the same size as the Republican advantage on immigration. We won\u2019t know for some time what the picture looks like with Vice President Harris at the top of the ticket. Voter trust in the Democratic candidate to handle health care issues could grow or shrink. The same is true for former President Trump\u2019s advantage on other issues now that he has a new opponent.\n\nSubstantive health policy platforms do matter in the election, but more for signaling than substance. The voters don\u2019t usually digest the details of policy plans, they hear the candidate\u2019s concern for the problem and for them. No doubt Vice President Harris will talk about the Biden-Harris record on health care during the campaign, featuring several policy achievements, including Medicare drug price negotiations (first prices are due in late August or early September); capping the cost of insulin at $35 a month for Medicare beneficiaries; the Medicare cap on out-of-pocket costs; enhancing ACA subsidies through 2025 to make coverage more affordable for many enrollees; and eliminating medical debt from credit reports.\n\nAll of these policies have two common attributes: voters can understand them and talking about them sends a signal: \u201cI am the candidate who cares about your health care costs.\u201d These policies only reach very targeted groups, and most voters don\u2019t actually feel their impact, but for Vice President Harris and Democrats, they are a way to show voters they care about their economic worries\u2014the critical issue area where former President Trump and Republicans otherwise have an advantage. When we asked voters who said they were most concerned about the economy what they meant by that in our polls, health care costs were near the top of the list, trailing inflation by just a few percentage points and well ahead of gas prices and every other economic worry. Politically, focusing on health care costs isn\u2019t about health care, it\u2019s a partial answer for Democrats to the advantage Republicans currently have on inflation and the economy.\n\nPresumably, Vice President Harris will also pick up on a number of Biden-Harris policy proposals, including increasing the number of drugs subject to negotiation, extending the insulin cost cap and the out-of-pocket cost cap beyond Medicare, and extending the enhanced ACA subsidies. It\u2019s always a plus politically to talk about addressing people\u2019s health care costs in concrete ways. The downside is alerting voters who were not previously aware that these policies reached narrower populations to begin with.\n\nPolicy proposals made in elections are often more about signaling than details and substance. The media dissects them. Stakeholders react to them. But for all except the most engaged voters, they are mostly signals of what candidates care about and ways for voters to locate candidates on the ideological spectrum. More for big government. Or more for smaller government. And so forth. Legislation is a different matter. Laws affect people\u2019s real lives and elected officials are held accountable for them.\n\nFinally, it would be surprising politically if Vice President Harris made significant new health proposals of her own during the campaign. She has the Biden-Harris health care record to run on and can play offense on health care and build on an established advantage on abortion and health generally. As she learned when she made an ill-fated Medicare for All proposal with a Medicare Advantage option as a candidate in a Democratic primary, putting out your own proposal puts you on defense and gives your opponent a target to shoot at. It can alienate groups who support you, who may want you to do more, or less, or something different.\n\nPlaying offense on abortion and health and signaling concern about kitchen table worries to voters are the most important roles health will play in the presidential election. Policy platforms and plans will matter far less this time.",

Kennedy Jr., Harris led Trump 42% to 38%, an advantage outside the margin of error. Kennedy, favored by 8% of voters in the poll, has yet to qualify for the ballot in many states ahead of the Nov. 5 election.The poll, which was conducted online, surveyed 1,241 U.S. adults nationwide, including 1,018 registered voters.A1.

        "text": "Joe Biden explains decision to end 2024 campaign, \u201cpass the torch\u201d to Kamala Harris\nU.S. President Joe Biden on July 24 delivered a solemn call to voters to defend the country\u2019s democracy as he laid out in an Oval Office address his decision to drop his 2024 presidential campaign and throw his support behind Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nInsisting that \u201cthe defense of democracy is more important than any title,\u201d Mr. Biden used his first public address since his announcement Sunday that he was stepping aside to deliver an implicit repudiation of former President Donald Trump. He did not directly call out Trump, whom he has called an existential threat to democracy. The 10-minute address also gave Mr. Biden a chance to try to shape how history will remember his one and only term in office.\n\n\u201cNothing, nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cAnd that includes personal ambition.\u201d It was a moment for the history books \u2014 a U.S. President reflecting before the nation on why he was taking the rare step of voluntarily handing off power. It hasn\u2019t been done since 1968, when Lyndon Johnson announced he would not seek reelection in the heat of the Vietnam War.\n\n\u201cI revere this office,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cBut I love my country more.\u201d Trump, just an hour earlier at a campaign rally, revived his baseless claims of voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election, which he lost to Mr. Biden. His refusal to concede inspired the Capitol insurrection of Jan. 6, 2021, which Mr. Biden called \u201cthe worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War.\u201d Mr. Biden skirted the political reality that brought him to that point: His abysmal performance in a debate against Trump nearly a month ago, where he spoke haltingly, appeared ashen and failed to rebut his predecessor\u2019s attacks, sparked a crisis of confidence from Democrats. Lawmakers and ordinary voters questioned not just whether he was capable of beating Trump in November, but also whether, at 81, he was still fit for the high-pressure job.\n\nMr. Biden tried to outlast the skepticism and quell the concerns with interviews and tepid rallies, but the pressure to step aside only mounted from the party\u2019s political elites and from ordinary voters.\n\n\u201cI have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation,\u201d Mr. Biden said, saying he wanted to make room for \u201cfresh voices, yes, younger voices.\u201d He added, \u201cThat is the best way to unite our nation.\u201d It was a belated fulfillment of his 2020 pledge to be a bridge to a new generation of leaders \u2014 and a bow to the drumbeat of calls from within his party to step aside.\n\nMr. Biden\u2019s address was carried live by the major broadcast and cable news networks. He spooled out an weighty to-do list for his last six months in office, pledging to remain focused on being president until his term expires at noon on Jan. 20, 2025. He said he would work to end the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, fight to boost government support to cure cancer and push for Supreme Court reform, among other things.\n\nThe President sought to use the address to outline the stakes in the election, which both Biden and Harris have framed as a choice between freedom and chaos, but he tried to steer clear of overt campaigning from his official office.\n\n\u201cThe great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cThe people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America \u2014 lies in your hands.\u201d Mr. Biden was also making the case for his legacy of sweeping domestic legislation and the renewal of alliances abroad. But the way history will remember his time in office and his historic decision to step aside is intertwined with Harris\u2019 electoral result in November, particularly as the vice president runs tightly on the achievements of the Biden administration.\n\nHis advisers say he intends to hold campaign events and fundraisers benefiting Ms. Harris, whom Mr. Biden praised as \u201ctough\u201d and \u201ccapable,\u201d albeit at a far slower pace than if he had remained on the ballot himself.\n\nMs. Harris advisers will ultimately have to decide how to deploy the President, whose popularity sagged as voters in both parties questioned his fitness for office.\n\nMr. Biden, aides say, knows that if Harris loses, he\u2019ll be criticized for staying in the race too long and not giving her or another Democrat time to effectively mount a campaign against Trump. If she wins, she\u2019ll ensure his policy victories are secured and expanded, and he\u2019ll be remembered for a Washingtonian decision to step aside for the next generation of leadership.\n\nMr. Biden said he\u2019s grateful to have served as President \u2014 nowhere else would a kid with a stutter grow up to sit in the Oval Office.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve given my heart and my soul to our nation,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been blessed a million times in return.\u201d Press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday that any question of Mr. Biden resigning his office before the election \u2014 which would allow Harris to run as an incumbent \u2014 was \u201cridiculous.\u201d Jean-Pierre said Mr. Biden has \u201cno regrets\u201d about his decision to stay in the race as long as he did, or his decision to quit it over the weekend. She said Mr. Biden\u2019s decision had nothing to do with his health.",

Who among the Democrats will take his place and receive a presidential nomination. While the party will soon hold its national convention in August, Vice-President Kamala Harris has emerged as the favorite. Polymarket which is a prediction market place has a different name that is making the rounds.The prediction market has revealed that people are increasingly betting on former First Lady Michelle Obama . She is quickly emerging as a favorite. The political scenario in the US is rapidly changing and Michelle\u2019s entry may be considered a \u2018wild card\u2019 entry.Data from the prediction market which has attracted bets worth more than $214 million has given Obama a 11% chance of replacing Joe Biden on the ballot box. Kamala Harris remains the favorite with the former first lady securing the second position.

The rules are clear that another candidate can replace him on the ballot box.

        "text": "Paris 2024: Geopolitics and the Olympics \u2014 USC News\nWhen French historian and educator Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the modern Olympics in 1894, he did so with a vision of promoting peace through sport. In reality, the Olympics have often reflected the geopolitics of the period.\n\nTensions flared Wednesday when Olympic officials moved to crush U.S. probes into a Chinese doping scandal. Multiple wars rage, political instability is shaking France and anxiety mounts about the U.S. presidential election. Can Olympic victories translate into geopolitical wins?\n\n\u201cInternational sporting events have become thoroughly politicized, and given the chaos around the globe, we can expect many acts of protest and disruption both inside and outside the stadiums of Paris,\u201d said Robert English, an associate professor of international relations, Slavic languages and literature and environmental studies at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences.\n\n\u201cWe live in an era in which reputation is central to the security of nations. A mega-event like the Olympics becomes a key platform to the host and participants alike,\u201d said Nicholas Cull, a historian and expert in public diplomacy, foreign policy and media at the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. \u201cInternational actors compete to showcase their own strengths and reveal the weaknesses of their adversaries, real or imagined.\u201d\n\nGeopolitics and the Olympics: Games are apolitical in theory, but not in practice\n\nThough the International Olympic Committee maintains a strong position against the politicization of sport in its Olympic Charter, reality often intrudes.\n\n\u201cIn the world we have, we know that the Olympics are political. The U.S. boycotted the 1980 Moscow Olympics because of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and earlier, in 1968, two Black American runners raised their fists in a Black power salute on the winners\u2019 podium,\u201d said Gregory Treverton, a professor of the practice of international relations and spatial sciences at USC Dornsife.\n\nTreverton, who served as chairman of the U.S. National Intelligence Council from 2014 to 2017 and previously worked for the first Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, where he handled Europe for the National Security Council, said that the main benefit of the Olympics from a political perspective is probably the athletes themselves, as they get to know their counterparts from other countries.\n\nAs athletes interact, they participate in a unique cultural exchange that only an event like the Olympics can provide, experts say.\n\nGeopolitics and the Olympics: Games a platform for public diplomacy?\n\nCull, a professor of communication at USC Annenberg, said he\u2019ll be watching athletes from smaller, lesser-known countries whose potential Olympic victories could have broader political ramifications.\n\nHe notes that Kosovo\u2019s 2016 Olympic success in women\u2019s judo was a \u201cmassive deal,\u201d which bolstered the nation\u2019s argument to be recognized as a nation in its own right rather than a runaway province of neighbor Serbia.\n\nExperts predict news headlines to center on the performances of U.S., Chinese and Russian athletes. Competitors from Russia and its ally, Belarus, will participate as Individual Neutral Athletes, without national flags or anthems, and will be excluded from the official medal table.\n\n\u201cRussia is effectively banned from the 2024 Summer Olympics because of its war in Ukraine. Ideally, this ban would work as another sanction to pressure Russia to stop the war,\u201d English said. \u201cPractically, it will have zero such effect and mainly serves to further alienate ordinary Russians from the West.\u201d\n\nUSC Professor Jonathan Aronson warned that the high-profile nature of the Olympics brings with it the potential for demonstrations or acts of violence, a Russian attack in Ukraine aimed at distracting global attention, efforts by right-wing French or European Union factions to undermine President Emmanuel Macron, road closures and travel disruptions, or a major cyberattack that could disrupt events.\n\n\u201cIf the Olympics proceed without significant disruptions, it will be considered a major success and a huge relief for the organizers,\u201d said Aronson, a professor of communication at USC Annenberg and a professor of political science and international relations at USC Dornsife.\n\nThe expert in international relations, communications, globalization and trade negotiations added: \u201cWhile there will be many touching personal stories during the Olympics, it is unrealistic to expect a widespread moment of public diplomacy or a unifying atmosphere.\u201d",

        "text": "\u2018We choose freedom\u2019: Kamala Harris campaign launches first ad\nThe Harris for President campaign has launched its first official video, less than a week after US President Joe Biden announced he was dropping out of the race and his vice-president Kamala Harris said she was running for the nomination.\n\nThe ad caps a week during which Harris also broke funding records and quickly clinched enough delegate support to become the presumptive nominee in an election that is now just over 100 days away.\n\nReleased on Thursday morning, the ad opens with shots of Harris\u2019s smiling face behind a podium, the word Kamala, the word Harris, and the American flag. The soundtrack is the beginning of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s song Freedom, to which Harris entered and exited her first speech to campaign staffers after gaining lightning speed momentum on the road to becoming the presumptive nominee.\n\nThe ad is narrated by Harris, whose first words are, \u201cIn this election we each face a question. What kind of country do we want to live in?\u201d\n\nShe continues: \u201cThere are some people who think we should be a country of chaos. Of fear. Of hate,\u201d she says, over shots of Trump and JD Vance. \u201cBut us, we choose something different.\u201d\n\nThe voiceover pauses for a crowd chanting, \u201cKamala! Kamala! Kamala!\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen A still from Kamala Harris\u2019 first campaign video. Photograph: Supplied\n\n\u201cWe choose freedom,\u201d she says. And Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s booming chorus starts: \u201cFreedom, freedom, I can\u2019t move. Freedom cut me loose. Freedom, freedom where are you, cause I need freedom too.\u201d\n\nHarris continues: \u201cThe freedom not just to get by, but to get ahead. The freedom to be safe from gun violence. The freedom to make decisions about your own body. We choose a future where no child lives in poverty. Where we can all afford healthcare. Where no one is above the law\u201d.\n\nThe last sentence appears as the screen shows images of front page after front page with headlines containing the words \u201cGuilty\u201d, or \u201cIndicted\u201d, \u201cConvicted\u201d, referring to Trump. There is also an image of Stormy Daniels.\n\n\u201cWe believe in the promise of America and we\u2019re ready to fight for it. Because when we fight. We win,\u201d Harris continues.\n\n\u201cSo join us. Go to Kamalaharris.com and let\u2019s get to work,\u201d she ends, as Beyonc\u00e9 sings: \u201cI\u2019ma keep running \u2019cause a winner don\u2019t quit on themselves.\u201d\n\nThe ad goes hard on optimism. Harris does not talk about her record as a prosecutor. The people shown are voters at rallies, at home, at work or at the doctor. There is a closeup of a woman in a lab coat embroidered with the word, \u201cObstetrics\u201d, a reference to Harris\u2019 strong stance on abortion rights. Almost everyone in the ad is smiling or laughing. They holding up placards saying Kamala and wave the New Progress pride flag.\n\nIt ends with Harris walking in a light, bright blue suit and applauding. Absent are the mentions of coconuts falling from trees, the context, Brat and the venn diagram that have done so much to turn Harris from awkward to cool on social media.\n\nThe messaging is a sharp departure from the 2020 campaign video that re-circulated online in the hours after Biden\u2019s resignation. Throughout that ad, a Law & Order SVU-like deep male voice directly compares Harris and Trump, beginning, \u201cHe\u2019s a world leader in temper tantrums. She never loses her cool. She prosecuted sex predators. He is one.\u201d It ends by calling Harris the \u201canti-Trump\u201d.\n\nBefore the ad aired, Beyonc\u00e9 was reported to have given Harris permission to use the song. While the singer has not explicitly endorsed Harris, the song permission will be viewed as tacit endorsement. Beyonc\u00e9 has long lent her support to the Democrats. She performed at Obama\u2019s second inauguration, in support of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign, and endorsed the 2020 Biden-Harris ticket.\n\nThe song features Pulitzer-winning rapper Kendrick Lamar and samples a lining hymn \u2013 part of the Black church tradition of unaccompanied call-and response singing \u2013 and a song performed by a prisoner at Mississippi State Penitentiary, the notorious prison labor farm famed for its musical history, in 1947.",

        "text": "Harris Narrows Gap Against Trump, Times/Siena Poll Finds\nVice President Kamala Harris begins a 103-day sprint for the presidency in a virtual tie with former President Donald J. Trump, according to the latest New York Times/Siena College poll, as her fresh candidacy was quickly reuniting a Democratic Party that had been deeply fractured over President Biden.\n\nJust days after the president abandoned his campaign under pressure from party leaders, the poll showed Democrats rallying behind Ms. Harris as the presumptive nominee, with only 14 percent saying they would prefer another option. An overwhelming 70 percent of Democratic voters said they wanted the party to speedily consolidate behind her rather than engage in a more competitive and drawn-out process.\n\n[The poll is full of findings unlike any we\u2019ve seen this cycle, with the exception of who leads the presidential race, Nate Cohn writes.]\n\nHer swift reassembling of the Democratic coalition appeared to help narrow Mr. Trump\u2019s significant advantage over Mr. Biden of only a few weeks ago. Ms. Harris was receiving 93 percent support from Democrats, the same share that Mr. Trump was getting from Republicans.",

        "text": "Is German government prepared for a possible Trump US election victory?\nWith less than four months until the US presidential election, the government in Berlin is preparing for the possibility of a Trump victory. How could his return impact Germany and the EU?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhile Donald Trump's election in 2016 surprised much of the world, this time, Europe \u2014 and Germany in particular \u2014 is already preparing for the possibility of a major shift in policy in Washington this November.\n\n\"Ultimately, it is a difficult situation to remain partners with such a difficult administration as under Trump. Germany has shown that it can somehow work, as it did last time when Trump was president,\" political scientist Dr Antonios Souris told Euronews.\n\n\"Although we must say the new administration is not yet in power, it is still a delicate situation,\" he added.\n\nThe world was a different place in 2016 when Trump was last elected \u2014 former Chancellor Angela Merkel was still in power, the pandemic had not choked the globe, and Russia had not yet launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIf Trump is to be re-elected, he would have to deal with the coalition government led by Chancellor Olaf Scholz \u2014 albeit possibly for less than a year since German voters are expected to elect a new chancellor and parliament in October 2025. Recent polls show the opposition conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) firmly ahead.\n\nWhat is Berlin doing?\n\nThe government is already boosting defence capabilities and working with partners to ensure that Europe remains a major world economic power regardless of who wins in the US in November, regional director of the German Marshall Fund Sudha David-Wilp told Euronews.\n\n\"Germany and its allies are making preparations for either scenario,\" she said.\n\nTransatlantic co-ordinator and FDP deputy parliamentary group leader Michael Link travelled to the US Republican Party convention in Milwaukee last week, where JD Vance was introduced as Trump's running mate. Link told Euronews that he has been preparing extensively for all scenarios for a long time.\n\n\"This includes, with regard to a possible second presidency of Trump, strengthening contacts with the US Republicans to identify where, despite all differences, there are also important shared interests,\" he said.\n\n\"I have been working on this for over two years. It also naturally includes consistently expanding contacts with promising individuals on the side of the US Democrats for the future.\"\n\nTrump with JD Vance at campaign rally, Saturday, July 20, 2024 AP Photo/Evan Vucci\n\nExperts are concerned after Trump said he would withdraw protection and encourage Russia to \"do whatever the hell they want\" to NATO member countries that didn't reach their 2% GDP spending targets back in February.\n\nOn the subject of NATO, Link said, \"the 2% goal remains Germany's central and crucial signal to the US, regardless of who is in the White House. This is in Germany's vital interest, and the federal government has already established this with the mid-term financial planning of the federal budget until 2028.\"\n\nBut Link wasn't the only one who attended the Milwaukee convention. Opposition politicians from the CDU and former health minister Jens Spahn also appeared.\n\nSouris says, \"Spahn is a central figure within the CDU, an ambitious politician with leadership responsibilities who is well-known, even abroad.\"\n\nWhat are Germany and the EU expecting?\n\nIf Trump wins, the general sense is that he might turn his attention to protecting US interests from Beijing, not Moscow.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe German Institute for International and Security Affairs (SWP) researcher Laura von Daniels told Euronews that JD Vance hinted at this at February's Munich Security Conference.\n\n\"The ammunition suppliers in the US are simply not sufficient to support Ukraine any longer. These supplies are needed to protect the US against potential threats from the Pacific, from the Indo-Pacific, of China, essentially,\" von Daniels recalled.\n\nResearch Fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations Filip Medunic also thinks transatlantic relations could influence US policy on China.\n\n\"Trump has already shown in his first term, and again now, that security policy is no longer taken for granted, as it used to be, for Europe and for Germany as a close ally of the US. It has been made clear that he is ready to demand costs that must be borne by the allies,\" he added.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nVon Daniels says that Germany and Europe need to increase spending on defence and military regardless of whether the next US government is Democratic or Republican.\n\nTaiwanese soldiers take part in drills at the Army defence command base in Taitung in southern Taiwan on Wednesday, Jan. 31, 2024. Johnson Lai/Copyright 2024 The AP. All rights reserved\n\n\"I think there's a sense that with Democrats it's more of a gradual process, whereas with Trump from day one, it would be aggression attacks.\"\n\nShe also warns that Trump could pick on Germany, as he did during his last term, \"because everyone, at least in Germany, I think in the foreign policy community, is quite sure that this that he has a problem with Germany in general,\" von Daniels adds.\n\nHowever, experts warn that the next few years in Europe could get more expensive, not just due to increased military spending but also because of Trump's approach to transatlantic trade.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"I think Europe is in a harder spot because it not only will face with higher tariffs on the part of a Trump to administration, higher tariffs with the United States, but will also face a flood of Chinese goods if the US is to continue on a protectionist or even draconian trade policy under a Trump administration,\" David-Wilp said.\n\nVon Daniels also speculated that Trump could return to office \"and from day one tell us that we the he still has a trade deficit with Europe and therefore we need to stop exporting German luxury cars. And then there would be tariffs.\"\n\nBut will it be enough?\n\nAlthough the German government has been preparing well behind the scenes for a potential second Trump term, his unpredictability is still of concern.\n\nTrump is known for making quick, rash decisions and deals his way, which could potentially change history not just for Ukraine and China but also for the Middle East.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFormer US President Donald Trump with Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2018 Pablo Martinez Monsivais/Copyright 2018 The AP. All rights reserved\n\nMedunic says that last time, Trump mixed security policy, economic policy, and foreign policies and is likely to do it again, despite them traditionally being kept separate.\n\n\"Trump will try to solve many problems his way, with a deal, meaning he will quickly demand negotiations,\" he said.\n\nHe also says there is a danger \"that Germany and also Europe will be side-lined.\"\n\n\"The biggest worry is really that Trump's serious about making a deal with Putin,\" without Germany, the EU or even Ukraine having a seat at the table,\" Von Daniels said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"And then they they discuss the fate of Ukraine essentially without Ukraine having a say either and then [Germany] would be in this very isolated position where the US and Russia are discussing stuff that has immediate consequences for our own security.\"\n\nIn addition, with Germany's federal elections just over a year away, both far right and far left parties are capitalising on anti-war rhetoric.\n\n\"For example, we now have three state elections in eastern Germany where support for Ukraine is not as high as in western German states. The AfD (Alternative for Germany) is also stirring up sentiment with certain rhetoric, and the Alliance of Sahra Wagenknecht is advocating an anti-war stance and opposing further expenditures while promoting diplomacy with Russia,\" Souris said.\n\nHowever, it's not all doom and gloom. Experts say that Germany has already navigated a Trump presidency for four years and has learned lessons from last time.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nUrsula Von der Leyen, who recently secured a second term as European Commission president, is regarded by Von Daniels as \"professional and experienced enough to know that she needs a working relationship\" with the US.",

        "text": "2024 California Ballot Propositions\nPropositions\n\nJump to section\n\nCalifornia voters decided on only one proposition on the March primary ballot \u2014 narrowly approving Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s mental health measure, Proposition 1.\n\nIn November, voters will determine the fate of 10 propositions \u2014 including whether to borrow a combined $20 billion for climate programs and school construction, whether to approve three amendments to the state constitution and what direction to take on crime, health care and taxes.\n\nThe 2024 ballot is still more crowded than in 2022, when there were only seven measures, the fewest in more than a century.\n\nProp 2 Borrow $10 billion to build schools, colleges This bond issue would authorize the state to borrow $8.5 billion for K-12 schools and $1.5 billion for community colleges for construction and modernization. Learn More \u2192\n\nProp 3 Reaffirm the right of same-sex couples to marry This constitutional amendment would remove outdated language from Proposition 8, passed by voters in 2008, that characterizes marriage as only between a man and a woman. Learn More \u2192\n\nProp 4 Borrow $10 billion to respond to climate change This bond issue would allow the state to borrow $3.8 billion for drinking water and groundwater programs, $1.5 billion for wildfire and forest programs and $1.2 billion for sea level rise. In part, the money would offset some budget cuts. Learn More \u2192\n\nProp 5 Lower voter approval requirements for local housing and infrastructure This constitutional amendment would make it easier for local governments to borrow money for affordable housing and some other public infrastructure projects by lowering the voter approval requirement from two-thirds to 55%. Learn More \u2192\n\nProp 6 Limit forced labor in state prisons This constitutional amendment would end indentured servitude in state prisons, considered one of the last remnants of slavery. The California Black Legislative Caucus included the proposal in its reparations agenda. Learn More \u2192\n\nProp 32 Raise the state minimum wage to $18 This initiative would raise the overall minimum wage from $16 an hour and adjust it for inflation, fast food workers received a $20 an hour minimum on April 1 and health care workers will eventually get $25, though not until at least Oct. 15. Learn More \u2192\n\nProp 33 Allow local governments to impose rent controls This is the latest attempt to roll back a state law that generally prevents cities and counties from limiting rents in properties first occupied after Feb. 1, 1995. Learn More \u2192\n\nProp 34 Require certain providers to use prescription drug revenue for patients Sponsored by the trade group for California\u2019s landlords, this measure is squarely aimed at knee-capping the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, which has been active in funding ballot measures (see Prop. 33). Learn More \u2192\n\nProp 35 Make permanent a tax on managed health care plans This initiative is sponsored by California\u2019s health care industry to raise more money for Medi-Cal and block lawmakers from using the cash to avoid cuts to other programs. The tax is set to expire in 2026. Learn More \u2192\n\nProp 36 Increase penalties for theft and drug trafficking This measure \u2014 supported by Republicans and law enforcement but opposed by Gov. Gavin Newsom and most Democrats \u2014 may be the most contentious on the ballot. It would partly roll back Proposition 47, approved by voters in 2014, that turned some felonies into misdemeanors.

        "text": "Los Tigres del Norte Talk 2024 U.S. Presidential Election: \u2018We Can Realize the Dream We All Want\u2019\nYou can always count on Los Tigres del Norte to tell it how it is, both onstage and off the stage.\n\nOn Thursday (July 25), the legendary Mexican group attended, for the first time ever, the Premios Juventud awards show, where they were honored with an Agent of Change Award for being La Voz del Pueblo. For decades, the band has used its platform to fight for social justice and amplify marginalized voices while advocating for immigration policies.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great satisfaction but at the same time very big because Agent of Change means many things,\u201d Hernan Hern\u00e1ndez told Billboard on the red carpet, just ahead of the awards ceremony. \u201cBut especially the people who help without expecting anything in return, help the community. Our music has helped many things, but outside of music, it helps people who need it; that gives us great satisfaction, to be able to do something with those who have given you so much. That is the distinction.\u201d\n\nThe band also shared a few words about the landscape of the 2024 presidential election in the United States. As artists who have encouraged the Latino vote, the band\u2019s leader, Jorge Hern\u00e1ndez, expressed, \u201cWe were a little nervous, but now that Mr. President has decided to leave a path for Kamala, well, I think that now we can realize the dream that we all want, and that she will be elected on this occasion, for various reasons.\u201d Adding, \u201cWe invite you to vote, those who can vote, and make their own decision. We will be fighting at any time to continue communicating to the whole nation the great importance of voting.\u201d\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nDuring the show, Los Tigres del Norte gave a powerful performance of their latest hit \u201cAqu\u00ed Mando Yo,\u201d and later thanked their families and fans for the support.\n\nThe 2024 Premios Juventud \u2014 a fan-voted awards show \u2014 is taking place at the Coliseo de Puerto Rico Jos\u00e9 Miguel Agrelot in San Juan and hosted by Lele Pons, Clarissa Molina and Wisin. For its 21st annual ceremony, Carin Le\u00f3n, Maluma, Peso Pluma, Karol G and Shakira are among the most nominated acts. Meanwhile, Anitta, Los Tigres del Norte and Lele Pons each received an Agent of Change Award, which \u201crecognizes and celebrates\u201d young entrepreneurs and prominent stars who \u201cselflessly contribute to creating a better world,\u201d according to the awards show. See the list of this year\u2019s winners here.\n\n\u2014Additional reporting by Ingrid Fajardo",

Share Copy Link Copy\n\nGREATEST HONORS OF MY LIFE TO SERVE AS VICE PRESIDENT TO OUR PRESIDENT. JOE BIDEN. JOE\u2019S LEGACY OF ACCOMPLISHMENT OVER HIS ENTIRE CAREER AND OVER THE PAST THREE AND A HALF YEARS IS UNMATCHED IN MODERN HISTORY. IN ONE TERM. THINK ABOUT IT IN ONE TERM, AS PRESIDENT, HE HAS ALREADY SURPASSED THE LEGACY OF MOST PRESIDENTS WHO SERVED TWO TERMS IN OFFICE. AND I KNOW WE ARE ALL DEEPLY, DEEPLY GRATEFUL FOR HIS CONTINUING SERVICE TO OUR NATION. AND IT IS MY GREAT HONOR TO HAVE JOE BIDEN\u2019S ENDORSEMENT IN THIS RACE. SO, WISCONSIN, I AM TOLD AS OF THIS MORNING THAT WE HAVE EARNED THE SUPPORT OF ENOUGH DELEGATES TO SECURE THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION. AND I AM SO VERY HONORED, AND I PLEDGE TO YOU I WILL SPEND THE COMING WEEKS CONTINUING TO UNITE OUR PARTY SO THAT WE ARE READY TO WIN IN NOVEMBER. SO, FRIENDS, WE HAVE 105 DAYS UNTIL ELECTION DAY, AND IN THAT TIME WE\u2019VE GOT SOME WORK TO DO. BUT WE\u2019RE NOT AFRAID OF HARD WORK. WE LIKE HARD WORK, DON\u2019T WE? AND WE WILL WIN THIS ELECTION. YES, WE WILL. SO AS LEAH TOLD YOU BEFORE, I WAS ELECTED VICE PRESIDENT, BEFORE I WAS ELECTED TO THE UNITED STATES SENATOR, I WAS ELECTED ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND I WAS A COURTROOM PROSECUTOR BEFORE THEN. AND IN THOSE ROLES I TOOK ON PERPETRATORS OF ALL KINDS. PREDATORS WHO ABUSED WOMEN, FRAUDSTERS WHO RIPPED OFF CONSUMERS, CHEATERS WHO BROKE THE RULES FOR THEIR OWN GAIN. SO HEAR ME WHEN I SAY I KNOW DONALD TRUMP\u2019S TYPE. AND IN THIS CAMPAIGN I PROMISE YOU, I WILL PROUDLY PUT MY RECORD AGAINST HIS ANY DAY OF THE WEEK. AS HIS ATTORNEY GENERAL OF CALIFORNIA, I TOOK ON ONE OF OUR COUNTRY\u2019S LARGEST FOR PROFIT COLLEGES. THAT WAS SCAMMING STUDENTS. DONALD TRUMP RAN A FOR PROFIT COLLEGE THAT SCAMMED STUDENTS. AS A PROSECUTOR, I SPECIALIZED IN CASES INVOLVING SEXUAL ABUSE. WELL, TRUMP WAS FOUND LIABLE FOR COMMITTING SEXUAL ABUSE AS ATTORNEY GENERAL OF CALIFORNIA. I TOOK ON THE BIG WALL STREET BANKS AND HELD THEM ACCOUNTABLE FOR FRAUD. DONALD TRUMP WAS JUST FOUND GUILTY OF FRAUD ON 34 COUNTS. BUT LET\u2019S ALSO MAKE NO MISTAKE, THIS CAMPAIGN IS NOT JUST ABOUT US VERSUS DONALD TRUMP. THIS CAMPAIGN IS ABOUT WHO WE FIGHT FOR. THIS IS ABOUT WHO WE FIGHT FOR. JUST LOOK AT HOW WE ARE RUNNING OUR CAMPAIGNS. SO DONALD TRUMP IS RELYING ON SUPPORT FROM BILLIONAIRES AND BIG CORPORATIONS AND HE IS TRADING ACCESS IN EXCHANGE FOR CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS. A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO, YOU ALL SAW THAT A COUPLE MONTHS AGO AT MAR-A-LAGO. HE LITERALLY PROMISED BIG OIL COMPANIES, BIG OIL LOBBYISTS, HE WOULD DO THEIR BIDDING FOR $1 BILLION IN CAMPAIGN DONATIONS. ON THE OTHER HAND, WE ARE RUNNING A PEOPLE POWERED CAMPAIGN. AND WE JUST HAD SOME BREAKING NEWS. WE JUST HAD THE. BEST 24 HOURS. OF GRASSROOTS FUNDRAISING IN PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN HISTORY. ALL RIGHT. AND BECAUSE WE ARE A PEOPLE POWERED CAMPAIGN, THAT IS HOW YOU KNOW, WE WILL BE A PEOPLE FIRST PRESIDENCY. AND WISCONSIN, THIS CAMPAIGN IS ALSO ABOUT TWO DIFFERENT VISIONS FOR OUR NATION ONE WHERE WE ARE FOCUSED ON THE FUTURE, THE OTHER FOCUSED ON THE PAST. WE BELIEVE IN A FUTURE WHERE EVERY PERSON HAS THE OPPORTUNITY, NOT JUST TO GET BY, BUT TO GET AHEAD. A FUTURE WHERE NO CHILD HAS TO GROW UP IN POVERTY, WHERE EVERY WORKER HAS THE FREEDOM TO JOIN A UNION. WHERE EVERY PERSON HAS AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE, AFFORDABLE CHILDCARE AND PAID FAMILY LEAVE. WE BELIEVE IN A FUTURE WHERE EVERY SENIOR CAN RETIRE WITH DIGNITY. SO ALL OF THIS IS TO SAY, BUILDING UP THE MIDDLE CLASS WILL BE A DEFINING GOAL OF MY PRESIDENCY. BECAUSE HERE\u2019S THE THING WE ALL HEAR WISCONSIN KNOW WHEN OUR MIDDLE CLASS IS STRONG, AMERICA IS STRONG. BUT DONALD TRUMP WANTS TO TAKE OUR COUNTRY BACKWARD. HE AND HIS EXTREME PROJECT 2025 AGENDA. WILL WEAKEN THE MIDDLE CLASS LIKE WE KNOW. WE GOT TO TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY. AND CAN YOU BELIEVE THEY PUT THAT THING IN WRITING? READ IT. IT\u2019S 900 PAGES. BUT HERE\u2019S THE THING. YOU, WHEN YOU READ IT, YOU WILL SEE DONALD TRUMP INTENDS TO CUT SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE. HE INTENDS TO GIVE TAX BREAKS TO BILLIONAIRES AND BIG CORPORATIONS AND MAKE WORKING FAMILIES FOOT THE BILL. THEY INTEND TO END THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. AND TAKE US BACK THEN TO A TIME WHEN INSURANCE COMPANIES HAD THE POWER TO DENY PEOPLE WITH PREEXISTING CONDITIONS. REMEMBER WHAT THAT WAS LIKE CHILDREN WITH ASTHMA, WOMEN WHO SURVIVED BREAST CANCER, GRANDPARENTS WITH DIABETES, AMERICA HAS TRIED THESE FAILED ECONOMIC POLICIES BEFORE, BUT WE ARE NOT GOING BACK. WE ARE NOT GOING BACK, NOT GOING BACK. WE\u2019RE NOT GOING BACK. WE ARE NOT GOING BACK. AND I\u2019LL TELL YOU WHY WE\u2019RE NOT GOING BACK, BECAUSE OURS IS A FIGHT FOR THE FUTURE. AND IT IS A FIGHT FOR FREEDOM. GENERATIONS OF AMERICA\u2019S GENERATIONS. AND WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THIS. THE SHOULDERS ON WHICH WE STAND, GENERATIONS OF AMERICANS BEFORE US LED THE FIGHT FOR FREEDOM AND NOW WISCONSIN. THE BATON IS IN OUR HANDS. WE WHO BELIEVE IN THE SACRED FREEDOM TO VOTE WILL MAKE SURE EVERY AMERICAN HAS THE ABILITY TO CAST THEIR BALLOT AND HAVE IT COUNTED. WE WHO BELIEVE THAT EVERY PERSON IN OUR NATION WHO SHOULD HAVE THE FREEDOM TO LIVE SAFE FROM THE TERROR OF GUN VIOLENCE, WILL FINALLY PASS RED FLAG LAWS, UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS, AND AN ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN. AND WE WHO BELIEVE IN REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM. WILL STOP DONALD TRUMP\u2019S EXTREME ABORTION BANS BECAUSE WE TRUST WOMEN TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR OWN BODIES AND NOT HAVE THEIR GOVERNMENT TELL THEM WHAT TO DO. AND WHEN CONGRESS PASSES A LAW TO RESTORE REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOMS AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, I WILL SIGN IT INTO LAW. SO WISCONSIN, ULTIMATELY, IN THIS ELECTION, WE EACH FACE A QUESTION WHAT KIND OF COUNTRY DO WE WANT TO LIVE IN? A COUNTRY. AND TO YOUR POINT, DO WE WANT TO LIVE IN A COUNTRY OF FREEDOM, COMPASSION AND RULE OF LAW OR A COUNTRY OF CHAOS, FEAR AND HATE? AND HERE\u2019S THE BEAUTY OF THIS MOMENT. WE EACH HAVE THE POWER TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION. THE POWER IS WITH THE PEOPLE WE EACH HAVE THE POWER TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION. AND IN THE NEXT 105 DAYS, THEN WE HAVE WORK TO DO. WE HAVE DOORS TO KNOCK ON. WE HAVE PHONE CALLS TO MAKE. WE HAVE VOTERS TO REGISTER, AND WE HAVE AN ELECTION TO WIN. SO WISCONSIN, TODAY, I ASK YOU, ARE YOU READY TO GET TO WORK? DO WE BELIEVE IN FREEDOM? DO WE BELIEVE IN OPPORTUNITY? DO WE BELIEVE IN THE PROMISE OF AMERICA? AND ARE WE READY TO FIGHT FOR IT? AND WHEN WE FIGHT, WE WIN THE BLESS YOU. GOD BLESS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. SOMEBODY YOU\u2019VE BEEN LISTENING TO VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS SPEAKING TO A CROWD AT WEST ALLIS CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL. HARRIS HOLDING HER FIRST RALLY AFTER LAUNCHING HER CAMPAIGN SUNDAY HOURS AFTER PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN DROPPED OUT AND ENDORSED HER. WE DO KNOW THAT, SHE SAID. THE PATH TO THE WHITE HOUSE RUNS THROUGH WISCONSIN, WHICH IS A BIG REASON WHY SHE\u2019S HERE TODAY. CAMPAIGNING IN MILWAUKEE IN WEST ALLIS, POLITICAL DIRECTOR MATT SMITH JOINS US LIVE ON THE PHONE FROM THE RALLY. MATT, WHAT DO YOU WHAT DO YOU THINK ARE YOUR BIGGEST TAKEAWAYS FROM THIS RALLY. MALLORY THE CAMPAIGN WAS LOOKING FOR DEMOCRATIC UNITY, AND THEY WERE LOOKING FOR A LOUD CROWD. AND THAT IS WHAT THEY GOT. AT LEAST INSIDE THIS GYMNASIUM SOME 3000 PEOPLE, SUPPORTERS. THAT IS A RECORD FOR A CAMPAIGN EVENT FOR THE BIDEN HARRIS TEAM. NOW, OBVIOUSLY JUST THE HARRIS CAMPAIGN. THIS IS HER FIRST OFFICIAL CAMPAIGN RALLY AS A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE. THIS GYMNASIUM WAS PACKED AS THE VICE PRESIDENT PLEADED WITH WISCONSIN DEMOCRATS TO GET ACTIVE. SHE MENTIONED 105 DAYS LEFT AS SHE CONTINUES TO WORK THE ROPE LINE HERE. SOME SUPPORTERS TRYING TO GET SELFIES IN THIS, HER OFFICIAL STOP. JUST SOME 48 HOURS AFTER PRESIDENT BIDEN DROPPED OUT OF THIS RACE, THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY SAID THIS WAS GOING TO BE ABOUT UNITY. WE\u2019LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN THE NEXT 105 DAYS. THE CROWD AT ONE POINT CHANTING LOCK HIM UP, REFERRING TO FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP, REMINISCENT OF REPUBLICANS YELLING LOCK HER UP FROM 2016, REFERRING TO HILLARY CLINTON. THE CROWD CHEERING KAMALA AS SHE WALKED OUT. SHE WASTED NO TIME. FIRST, AFTER THANKING PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN, ACKNOWLEDGING THAT SHE NOW HAS THE DELEGATES NEEDED TO SECURE THE NOMINATION AT THE CONVENTION. IN CHICAGO, SHE WASTED NO TIME GOING AFTER FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP, A PREVIEW OF WHAT WE ARE GOING TO SEE ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL, STARTING AT THIS MOMENT IN WISCONSIN, SHE HAS SAID THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS SAID THIS IS NOW A CAMPAIGN ABOUT PROSECUTING DONALD TRUMP\u2019S RECORD AND HISTORY. A NUMBER OF PROMINENT WISCONSIN DEMOCRATS HERE, GOVERNOR TONY EVERS, SENATOR TAMMY BALDWIN, BOTH SPEAKING BEFORE THE VICE PRESIDENT ALONG WITH MAYOR CAVALIER JOHNSON, MILWAUKEE COUNTY EXECUTIVE DAVID CROWLEY. THE CAMPAIGN AT THIS MOMENT, MALLORY LOOKS TO SEE THIS AS A PIVOTAL MOMENT, A RESET OF SORTS. BUT THERE IS A DRAMATICALLY SHORT TIME FRAME HERE. THERE IS NEW POLLING GOING INTO THE FIELD TOMORROW FROM THE MARQUETTE LAW SCHOOL POLL. THE QUESTION IS HOW MUCH OF A RESET IS THIS IN KEY SWING STATES LIKE WISCONSIN, WHERE TRUMP HAS HAD A34, FIVE POINT LEAD OVER PRESIDENT BIDEN, THE HEAD TO HEAD MATCHUPS WITH KAMALA HARRIS HAVE NARROWED IT A BIT. BUT THIS IS A MOMENT THAT DEMOCRATS SAY THEY NEEDED, AND THEY WILL LOOK TO CAPITALIZE AS THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WILL LOOK TO RESPOND. AND THIS NEW CAMPAIGN, SO TO SPEAK, BETWEEN HARRIS AND TRUMP, KICKS OFF AT THIS MOMENT IN MILWAUKEE, WISCONSIN. MALLORY POLITICAL DIRECTOR MATT SMITH REPORTING FROM THAT RALLY AT WEST ALLIS CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL, WHERE VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS JUST SPOKE TO A CROWD REALLY KICKING OFF HER CAMPAIGN TO BE T\n\nGET OUR POLITICS NEWSLETTER Stay up to speed on all the latest local and national political news.

        "text": "US presidential election energizes fast-growing Indian American community\nU.S. Vice President Kamala Harris' meteoric rise to the top of the Democratic Party's presidential ticket has energized many Indian Americans, raising the fast-growing community's political profile and sparking widespread excitement.\n\nHarris, who is of Indian and Jamaican descent, appears set to become the first female presidential nominee of color after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race on Sunday. But the fervor isn't solely about her nomination.\n\nMany Indian Americans, regardless of political leanings, are equally electrified to see other notable figures of Indian descent in the national spotlight: Usha Vance, the wife of Republican vice presidential nominee J.D. Vance, as well as former presidential candidates Nikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy.\n\n\"I'm very proud that Indian Americans are making it on every stage,\" said Shaker Narasimhan, chair and founder of AAPI Victory Fund, a super PAC focused on mobilizing Asian American and Pacific Islander voters and supporting Democratic candidates.\n\nNarasimhan recalled being on a call with about 130 people when news broke that Biden had dropped his presidential bid and endorsed Harris.\n\n\"Everything lit up, literally: the chats, the DMs, the phones,\" Narasimhan said. \"But it was all with excitement, not wonderment, like, 'Wow.' It was like, 'Oh my God, let's go,' This is just the opportunity of a lifetime, as far as I'm concerned, for us to show our muscles.\"\n\nThe enthusiasm cuts across the political spectrum. Priti Pandya-Patel, co-founder of the New Jersey Republican Party's South Asia Coalition, said the community is buzzing about the prospect of Usha Vance becoming the country's first Indian American second lady.\n\n\"I think it's just a proud moment to see our community actually being out there and being noticed,\" Pandya-Patel said. \"I think that is definitely getting our Indian community very excited.\"\n\n5 million in US\n\nIndian Americans are one of the fastest-growing immigrant communities, surging more than tenfold since the early 1990s.\n\nToday, there are roughly 5 million people of Indian descent living in the United States, making them the largest Asian ethnic group and the second-largest immigrant group after Mexicans.\n\nWhile Indian Americans vote Democratic more than any other Asian group, roughly 20% identify as Republican.\n\nThe Indian American community has traditionally been perceived as politically less active than some other ethnic groups. However, there are indications of growing political engagement within the community.\n\nA recent survey of Asian Americans, including those of Indian descent, found that 90% intended to vote in the November election even though 42% had not been contacted by either party or candidate.\n\nThe Asian American Voter Survey, of nearly 2,500 voters, was conducted between April 4 to May 26 by several Asian American groups.\n\n\"So that suggests a potential gap in engagement,\" said Suhag Shukla, co-founder and executive director of the non-partisan Hindu American Foundation.\n\nShukla said the election presents a \"tremendous opportunity\" for the Indian American community as well as the two major political parties.\n\n\"I think Indian Americans need to recognize their power, especially because many of us do live in either purple states or purple districts,\" Shukla said in an interview with VOA, referring to battleground states in the U.S. presidential election. \"On the flip side, I think that it's a real opportunity for the parties to do not just a checkmark or a checkbox-type outreach, but genuine outreach. Have town halls. Have listening sessions.\"\n\nSpokespeople for the Harris and Trump campaigns did not respond to questions about their community outreach efforts.\n\nBoth campaigns mobilize voters through grassroots organizations.\n\nDeepa Sharma, deputy director of South Asians for Harris and a delegate to next month's Democratic National Convention, said her group is \"working closely with people on the ground who will knock on doors, will do phone bank and outreach to this community.\"\n\nIndian Americans comprise less than 1% of U.S. registered voters, according to a 2020 study by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. But almost one-third live in closely contested battleground states such as Georgia, North Carolina and Pennsylvania.\n\nThat puts them in a position to sway the outcome of the November election, said Chintan Patel, executive director of Indian American Impact, a progressive group.\n\n\"The South Asian American population far exceeds the margin of victory in the closest elections in these states,\" Patel said.\n\nVoter turnout steadily climbing\n\nIn 2020, the Biden-Harris ticket carried more than 70% of the Indian American vote, according to Patel, adding that support for Harris is likely to edge higher this year.\n\n\"She has drawn considerable support from the South Asian American community because she has consistently shown up and fought for our values, fought for our issues,\" Patel said.\n\nEarlier this year, Harris spoke at Indian American Impact's \"Desis Decide\" summit, where she credited Indian Americans and Asian Americans with helping to get two Democratic senators elected in 2020 and 2021.\n\nPatel said voter turnout among South Asian Americans has been steadily climbing in recent years. In 2020, for example, more than 70% of registered South Asian American voters turned out to vote in Pennsylvania, he said.\n\n\"I think they're going to be instrumental in delivering the White House this November,\" Patel said.\n\nSimilar predictions by groups such as Muslim Americans have sometimes failed to materialize.\n\nBut Narasimhan said turnout could be boosted with the right voter mobilization strategy, adding that voter education is key.\n\n\"Just because you're a citizen doesn't mean you can vote, you have to register,\" Narasimhan said. \"Teaching people the basic rudimentaries of what's early voting, what's absentee balloting, what's going to the polls, navigating the system is critical, and we have to do that basic education.\"\n\nOn the Republican side, activists are betting that Trump's close ties to India's Hindu nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi will translate into votes for the former president.\n\n\"Trump has been friendly to India and that makes a big difference,\" Pandya-Patel, the Republican activist in New Jersey, said.\n\nWhether Indian American support for Trump is rising remains unclear.\n\nIn the recent Asian American Voter Survey, 29% of Indian Americans said they intended to vote for Trump, largely unchanged from four years ago.\n\nTrump has called Modi a \"true friend.\" In 2019, he and Modi addressed a joint rally in Houston, Texas, that attracted more than 50,000 people, many supporters of the Indian prime minister. At the \"Howdy, Modi!\" rally, Trump called Modi \"one of America's greatest, most devoted and most loyal friends.\"\n\nPandya-Patel said the rally boosted Indian American support for Trump, whose friendship with Modi, she added, is a key reason many Indian Americans back him.\n\nShukla of the Hindu American Foundation said there is a perception among some Indian Americans that the Democratic Party is not \"a Hindu-friendly party.\"\n\nThat may partly explain a recent \"shift\" in Indian American party affiliation, she said.\n\nIn the Asian American Voter Survey, the number of Indians who identify as Democrats fell from 54% in 2020 to 47% in 2024, while those identifying with the Republican Party rose from 16% to 21%.\n\nAnang Mittal, a Virginia-based commentator who previously worked for House Speaker Mike Johnson, said the apparent shift reflects less a \"sea change\" than shifting political attitudes.\n\n\"I think the country as a whole is sort of shifting towards Republicans because of the larger issues that are plaguing this election,\" Mittal said.",

        "text": "Barack Obama endorses Kamala Harris for president in 2024 US election\nBarack Obama has endorsed Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee for US president, meaning the vice-president has now won the backing of all the party\u2019s politically active high-profile figures for her White House bid.\n\nThe former president had conspicuously withheld his endorsement in the immediate aftermath of Joe Biden\u2019s decision to withdraw from the campaign, and was initially believed to favour an open nominating contest at next month\u2019s Democratic national convention in Chicago.\n\nBut after Harris earned the backing of Bill and Hillary Clinton, Nancy Pelosi, a host of state governors and the most senior Democrats in Congress \u2013 as well as Biden himself \u2013 Obama has added his voice in what amounts to a major boost for the vice-president.\n\nThe 44th president was joined by wife Michelle, the former first lady, in a phone call with Harris that was filmed and released by her campaign on Friday. In the video, Harris is seen listening to the Obamas on an iPhone in her right hand.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t have this phone call without saying to my girl Kamala: I am proud of you,\u201d Michelle Obama says. \u201cThis is going to be historic.\u201d\n\nBarack Obama weighs in: \u201cWe called to say Michelle and I couldn\u2019t be prouder to endorse you and do everything we can to get you through this election and into the Oval Office.\u201d\n\nSmiling, standing near a vehicle, Harris replies: \u201cOh my goodness. Michelle, Barack, this means so much to me, I am looking forward to doing this with the two of you, Doug and I both. And getting out there, being on the road.\u201d\n\nShe adds: \u201cBut most of all, I just wanna tell you that the words you have spoken and the friendship that you have given over all these years mean more than I can express. So thank you both! It means so much. And, and we\u2019re gonna have some fun with this too, aren\u2019t we?\u201d\n\nThe endorsement comes as the Harris campaign, which has made a flying start, launches a \u201cweekend of action\u201d marking 100 days until the election with more than 170,000 volunteers and 2,300 events across battleground states.\n\nObama was the first Black US president and is endorsing a candidate who, if she wins against Donald Trump in November, will become the first woman, first Black woman and first person of south Asian descent to serve as president.\n\nHarris has narrowed the gap with Trump in opinion polls, trailing him 48% to 47% among likely voters in a New York Times/ Siena College survey. Trump was leading Biden by six percentage points in this poll after their debate.",

James Carville issued a warning to the party that it is not going to be easy in the months ahead of the presidential election in November. The party will need to focus on certain key strategies.He made these comments when he appeared on the MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe show. He said that there is enthusiasm in the party after Joe Biden quit the race and Kamala Harris emerged as a front runner to replace him. She has also already raised more than $200 million within 24 hours. However, she is going to find that the campaign will only get tough.The presidential election will take place on November 5 and the Democrats will hold their national convention from August 19-22. There may be a virtual roll call before the national convention. Kamala Harris is expected to receive the presidential nomination during this period. Can she afford to take it lightly till then?This is what Carville has warned against. He pointed out that a presidential campaign , normally lasts over a period of eight months and now Harris will have to execute this campaign in less than four months. Time is running out and she will to work hard and strategically plan out the campaign. She will need to focus on the swing states. Joe Biden\u2019s popularity in these states had considerably reduced in recent times. She will need to work on re-capturing the support from these states.Carville also pointed out that Donald Trump has managed to convince a large section of the electorate to support him. He may have lied, used disinformation tactics and everything else to take on the Democrats. Kamala Harris will need to work on breaking this complex phenomenon and address the voters directly. He added that the Republicans do not care about what is fair and what is not and this will pose a challenge to the Democrats.Many political analysts consider her as a political novice. She had contested the party primaries in 2020 against Joe Biden and dropped out at an early stage. She may find it tough to take on a former president who is viciously campaigning to return to the White House for a second term.Most of those front runners have now fully endorsed Harris\u2019 nomination. She has received the support from almost all the Democrats, cutting across various interest groups. There are news reports that Michelle Obama may receive a nomination and may replace Joe Biden. This is yet to be seen.",

        "text": "What is Project 2025? A look at the conservative presidential wish list\nTrump has distanced himself from the Project 2025 though some ideals align.\n\nWhat is Project 2025? A look at the conservative presidential wish list\n\nProject 2025, a 922-page playbook of controversial policy proposals intended to guide the next conservative administration, is gaining attention as the presidential election campaigns heat up.\n\nProject 2025 has been authored by at least two dozen members of Donald Trump's administration and allies, organized by conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation and is backed by more than 100 additional groups.\n\nDemocrats say the plan is a warning of what is to come under a second Trump term, while Trump has tried to distance himself from the policy proposals: \"They are extreme, seriously extreme,\" said Trump in a July 20 rally. \"I don\u2019t know anything about it. I don\u2019t want to know anything about it.\"\n\nProject 2025 officials told ABC News that it does \"not speak for any candidate or campaign.\" However, Trump's official campaign plan called Agenda47 aligns with several proposals in Project 2025.\n\nSo, what is in Project 2025?\n\nSome of Project 2025's goals\n\nThe project suggests disbanding federal agencies like the Department of Education -- an idea Trump has supported -- and the Department of Homeland Security. It recommends privatizing others, including the Transportation Security Agency, and would expand presidential control over the executive branch.\n\n\"The modern conservative president\u2019s task is to limit, control and direct the executive branch on behalf of the American people,\" the project reads in its first section titled, \"Taking the Reins of Government.\"\n\nRepublican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally, July 9, 2024, in Doral, Fla. Rebecca Blackwell/AP\n\nOn health care, the project recommends withdrawing the abortion pill mifepristone from the market and stopping the drug from being mailed, eliminating mandated insurance coverage for the week-after pill, prohibit funding for patients traveling across state lines for reproductive health care and prohibit funding for health care centers that provide abortions.\n\nAdditionally, the project suggests that the Department of Health and Human Services should \"maintain a biblically based, social science-reinforced definition of marriage and family.\"\n\nOn climate change, Project 2025 suggests cutting federal money for research and investment in renewable energy, and instead calls for the next president to \"stop the war on oil and natural gas.\"\n\nThe project aims to repeal and eliminate preventive climate change initiatives. The project calls for replacing carbon-reduction goals to instead increase the use of fossil fuel energy production and \"energy security.\"\n\nThis aligns with Trump's official Agenda47, in which Trump said he plans to make America the \"No. 1 producer of oil and natural gas in the world.\"\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security seal August 21, 2019 in Washington, DC. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nOn economics, the proposals recommend cutting and restricting the use of food stamps and social welfare programs, creating more eligibility requirements for Medicaid, creating a two-rate individual tax system of 15% and 30%, reducing the corporate income tax rate, cutting rates for high-income investors and canceling federal student loan forgiveness programs.\n\nOn housing, the project recommends that it reverse several Biden administration policies, including the Housing Supply Fund, which states that it provides funding and low-income housing tax credits to \"address market gaps, increase housing supply and help to stabilize housing prices over the long term \u2026 [and] remove barriers to affordable housing development.\"\n\nIt also would remove Biden-backed programs aimed at addressing housing discrimination, including the Property Appraisal and Valuation Equity program and affirmatively furthering fair housing.\n\nTrump's Agenda47 broadly calls for new home construction, tax incentives and cutting housing regulation.\n\nThe US Department of Education February 9, 2024, in Washington, DC. J. David Ake/Getty Images\n\nOn diversity, the project proposes eliminating several terms from \"every federal rule, agency regulation, contract, grant, regulation, and piece of legislation that exists\" including: \"sexual orientation,\" \"gender,\" \"gender equality,\" \"gender awareness,\" \"gender-sensitive\" \"abortion,\" \"reproductive health,\" \"reproductive rights,\" \"diversity, equity, and inclusion\" and more.\n\nOn immigration, the project advocates for immediately deporting unaccompanied children, increased funding for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, for the implementation of fees for asylum seekers and speedier processing at a premium price, pause funding for nongovernmental immigration groups and more.\n\nProject 2025 also advocates for a \"merit-based immigration system,\" and urges the next president to get rid of the existing employment visa process, the family-based chain migration process and lottery systems, replacing it with a system \"to award visas only to the best and brightest.\"\n\nIn Trump's Agenda47, he states he plans on carrying out \"the largest deportation operation in American history\" as well as reinstated Trump-era policies including increased focus on the border wall.\n\nOn education, the document calls for increased school choice and parental control over schools -- limiting federal school accountability and encouraging every parent to direct their child\u2019s share of public education funding \"to choose a set of education options that meet their child's unique needs\" -- which has been embraced by several conservative leaders through ESA programs.\n\nIt also bars public education employees from using a name or pronoun other than what is listed on a student's birth certificate without a parent's permission, and it would not require a school employee to use a name or pronoun for someone \"that does not match a person\u2019s biological sex if contrary to the employee\u2019s or contractor\u2019s religious or moral convictions.\"\n\nTrump similarly backs school choice policies, eliminating tenure for teachers, defund schools that \"promote gender transition,\" and plans to \"promote love of country\" in education.\n\nHe also states on his website that he plans to sue large private universities and \"use that money to endow a new institution called the American Academy.\"\n\nSeparately, the project recommends that pornography be \"outlawed\" and criminalize its distribution.\n\nIs Trump tied to Project 2025?\n\nWhile Trump has said that he doesn't know anything about Project 2025, several of the former president's current and former advisers and appointees have authored or supported the project.\n\nThey include:\n\nChristopher Miller -- who served as Acting Secretary of Defense and Special Assistant to the President under Trump -- is credited with the project's Department of Defense recommendations.\n\nBen Carson -- who served as the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) under Trump -- is credited with the project's (HUD) recommendations.\n\nBrendan Carr -- who was appointed to serve as a member of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) -- is credited with the project's FCC recommendations.\n\nAdam Candeub -- who served under the Trump administration as Acting Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Telecommunications and Information -- is credited with the project's Federal Trade Commission recommendations\n\nBernard L. McNamee -- who was nominated to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by Trump -- is credited with recommendations on the Department of Energy and Related Commissions.\n\nAdditionally, the RNC platform committee's policy director, Russ Vough, authored a portion of the Project 2025 plan.\n\nThe RNC platform committee's Deputy Policy Director Ed Martin is also president of the Eagle Forum Education & Legal Defense Fund, which is listed on the project's advisory board.\n\nPresident Joe Biden speaks from the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington, July 14, 2024. Susan Walsh/AP\n\nOthers connected to Trump, including Trump's United Nations Commission on the Status of Women appointee Lisa Correnti, are listed among the contributors.\n\nSome conservatives are distancing themselves from Project 2025, including former Trump adviser Stephen Miller, who is requesting the removal of his organization, America First Legal, from the website's list of advisory board members, sources familiar with the situation told ABC News.\n\nHowever, Trump's official Agenda47 and the proposals uplifted by the Republican National Committee align in part with some of Project 2025's goals.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's campaign has used Project 2025 in its efforts to motivate voters away from Trump.\n\n\"Project 2025 is the plan by Donald Trump\u2019s MAGA Republican allies to give Trump more power over your daily life, gut democratic checks and balances, and consolidate power in the Oval Office if he wins,\" Biden's campaign states on its website.\n\nABC News' Will Steakin and Soo Rin Kim contributed to this report.",

        "text": "Trump vs Harris: What US elections will mean for T\u00fcrkiye\nWith the U.S. presidential race looking all but set to come down to a Donald Trump versus Kamala Harris ticket, the outcome of the November election will impact agitated relations with T\u00fcrkiye as well.\n\nRegardless of whether a Democrat or a Republican is in the White House, Ankara will have much to tackle in its dealings with Washington in the upcoming period, a range of differing stances that threaten to evolve into full-blown crises if left unattended any longer.\n\nExperts argue that a Harris presidency could preserve the Joe Biden-installed status quo if not guided by more T\u00fcrkiye-friendly advisers, while Trump's return could at the least reignite long-dead dialogue on the Turkish-U.S. front.\n\nDuring the four years Trump steered the White House, relations with T\u00fcrkiye could best be described as \u201cturbulent,\u201d marked by several high-tension incidents, including the 2018 Pastor Brunson crisis, the YPG problem and Washington\u2019s attitude on FET\u00d6, that often highlighted the downward trajectory of the past decade.\n\nNow, with Trump\u2019s potential return to power, T\u00fcrkiye can look forward to a return to dialogue, according to \u00c7a\u011fr\u0131 Erhan, the president of Alt\u0131nba\u015f University and a member of the Presidential Security and Foreign Policies Council.\n\n\u201cThis was not the case during Biden\u2019s term when Barack Obama\u2019s bureaucrats came back to power and channels of dialogue were essentially eliminated and several issues like the F-16 deal, F-35 fighter jets, northern Syria were left hanging,\u201d Erhan said.\n\nSyrian snag\n\nProblems that began during Obama\u2019s presidency, or even farther back in 2003 during the Iraqi war, continued into Trump and Biden\u2019s terms, but it was Trump who more often heeded T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s concerns about the YPG, the Syrian offshoot of the terrorist group PKK, that has occupied the oil-rich region since 2015.\n\nThe PKK took up arms against the Turkish state in 1984 to achieve so-called Kurdish self-rule in southeastern regions and is designated a terrorist organization by Ankara, as well as the United States and the European Union.\n\nWashington calls the YPG its ally under the pretext of driving out remaining Daesh terrorists, something Ankara considers as support of a threat against its national security. Turkish cross-border airstrikes have targeted the YPG in the region since 2016.\n\nAt the time, Trump showed a willingness to address T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s concerns over the YPG, promising to remove it from the Turkish border area but later failing to do so.\n\nIt was the U.S. military\u2019s pressure that kept him from making any radical changes to Washington\u2019s Syria policy about T\u00fcrkiye, according to Kadir \u00dcst\u00fcn, the executive director at the Washington branch of the Foundation for Political, Economic and Social Research (SETA).\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s reelection could reenergize the management of certain crises, including Syria,\u201d \u00dcst\u00fcn told Daily Sabah. \u201cIn that case, the strategic dialogue mechanism also needs a strong boost and his administration must care about political coordination with Ankara.\u201d\n\nIn the past four years, in stark contrast to frequent one-on-ones with Trump, Biden has not paid a single visit to T\u00fcrkiye, nor did he host President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan in the White House. Adding to the grievances, his administration has refused to cut off support to the YPG or extradite G\u00fclenist Terrorist Group (FET\u00d6) members, including its ringleader Fetullah G\u00fclen, who oversaw a deadly coup attempt in T\u00fcrkiye in July 2016.\n\nMore recently, the NATO allies have been at loggerheads over Israel\u2019s brutal war on the Gaza Strip. Ankara, a staunch defender of the Palestinian cause, has repeatedly slammed the U.S. for giving express military and political shield to Israel and its \u201cwar crimes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis attitude alone demonstrates Biden\u2019s perspective on the Middle East,\u201d Erhan said, whom he accused of sporting a \u201clack of seriousness\u201d in failing to keep promises, particularly with the F-16 deal now stuck at Congress.\n\nHe believes under Trump, Ankara and Washington must navigate a three-tiered negotiation process to address problems like Syria, Gaza, fighter jets, FET\u00d6 and trade, although Trump\u2019s firm support of Israel is still \u201cunacceptable\u201d for T\u00fcrkiye.\n\nU.S. Vice President and Democratic Presidential candidate Kamala Harris speaks at West Allis Central High School during her first campaign rally in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, U.S., July 23, 2024. (AFP Photo)\n\nHarris\u2019 elites\n\nErhan doesn\u2019t believe there is any indication Harris, \u201cwho has no known foreign policy,\u201d could undo the Biden-inflicted damage on bilateral issues or introduce fresh policies toward T\u00fcrkiye, either.\n\n\u00dcst\u00fcn, however, is more optimistic about a foreign policy shift from Harris, citing her national security adviser Philip Gordon\u2019s 2008 book \u201cWinning T\u00fcrkiye,\u201d proposing plans to ease tensions in the region.\n\n\u201cSince her foreign policy knowledge is incomparable to Biden\u2019s, she will seek out more consultations and depending on who she will appoint as Secretary of State or national security adviser, her presidency could create a positive dynamic for T\u00fcrkiye,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to international relations expert Murat Aslan, however, any sympathy or anti-sympathy from the U.S. toward T\u00fcrkiye is irrelevant in shaping the White House\u2019s T\u00fcrkiye policy.\n\nWhat matters is how the U.S., which, independent of Biden, Trump, or Harris, adheres to its own state tradition, positions T\u00fcrkiye pertaining to global issues, Aslan quipped.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. interests have led Washington to cooperation in Europe, keeping Asia-Pacific on its axis and a state of competition with T\u00fcrkiye in the Middle East,\u201d Aslan said. \u201cI don\u2019t think this will change any time soon.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not realistic to expect Harris to change U.S. engagement with T\u00fcrkiye if she maintains (Biden\u2019s) ruling elite,\u201d he said.\n\nAslan argued that the more relations are strained with T\u00fcrkiye, the more support Washington lends to the YPG and the more T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s \u201cexistential threat motivation\u201d surges in the fields the allies compete.\n\n\u201cWashington must decide if it wants to compete with T\u00fcrkiye in the region, especially on Syria, or cooperate with it,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump\u2019s terms, Israel\n\nErdo\u011fan, who is known for his cordial relationship with Trump, recently said, \u201cWe are planning to do very interesting things\u201d with the former U.S. president.\n\nThe Turkish leader could have meant that Trump is inclined to revise Middle Eastern policies and even make radical decisions, \u00dcst\u00fcn argued.\n\nHe also predicts Ankara and Washington will remain at odds over Palestine, especially after the U.S. has recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, but Trump\u2019s desire to \u201cmake history\u201d by facilitating peace in Palestine and Ankara\u2019s critical role in the conflict indicates a potential for close coordination for a two-state solution.\n\nAslan, however, argued Trump could make any normalization with Ankara conditional on normalization with Israel, as he has in the past with the Brunson crisis. Trump imposed sanctions on two Turkish ministers and doubled tariffs on Turkish metals, threatening to plunge the lira to secure Brunson\u2019s release, who was jailed for two years on espionage charges.\n\nSince Israel began bombing Gaza, killing nearly 40,000 Palestinians in retaliation to Hamas\u2019 cross-border Oct. 7 attack, Ankara has been a vocal critic of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as Erdo\u011fan branded him the \u201cButcher of Gaza\u201d and cut off all trade.\n\n\u201cSuch a stipulation would put T\u00fcrkiye in a dilemma,\u201d Aslan said.\n\nStill, he believes Trump, who has voiced positive remarks similar to T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s arguments on certain issues, could be directed by his presidential experience and manage more stability in relations with T\u00fcrkiye come January.",

        "text": "Risk and Resilience: Preparing for Uncertainty in the 100 Days to the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election\nJuly 27 will mark the beginning of the 100-day countdown to the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election. President Biden's decision on July 21 to end his reelection campaign capped off a series of significant events over the last two months, including the July 13 assassination attempt on former President Trump while he was speaking at a campaign rally in Butler, PA.\n\nBoth developments have taken place amid an already elevated domestic security environment, stemming from threats related to the Israel-Hamas conflict, election-related disinformation, ongoing activity from a myriad of movements with a variety of grievances, and the desire by a range of extremist and terrorist groups to sow further civil unrest and political violence. As such, the final countdown leading up to election day, as well as the immediate aftermath, has the potential to repeatedly and impactfully disrupt normal business operations. To effectively navigate this uncertainty, organizations and their leaders would be remiss not to develop multifaceted preparations that include robust intelligence analysis and scenario planning, as well as reinforce their crisis preparedness, business continuity and security plans.\n\nWhat the Next 100 Days Will Look Like\n\nThe political landscape will be highly dynamic over the next 100 days, particularly the next several weeks, which in turn will impact the various vectors at play that influence the domestic security environment. In the lead up to and during the Republican National Committee (RNC) Convention, held in Milwaukee, WI from July 15-18, the Republican Party was focused on solidifying its base and appealing to independent voters. In addition to formally cementing the Party\u2019s candidate for president, the focus of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) Convention, scheduled to take place in Chicago, IL from August 19 to 22, will be attempting to unify the party and rallying both democrats and undecided voters. A range of actors \u2013 including activist movements, extremist groups and foreign adversaries and their influence operations \u2013 have already demonstrated their intent to capitalize on this uncertainty and will likely continue to seek to do so in the following ways:\n\nElection-related mis- and disinformation will surge: The final stretch leading up to the election will likely see a notable surge in election-related mis- and disinformation campaigns, targeting both parties, individual candidates up and down the ballot, as well as the integrity of the elections themselves. A variety of actors \u2013 including foreign adversaries, domestic political and extremist groups and individual threat actors \u2013 are likely to contribute to this trend. Their motivations range from undermining public trust in the electoral process, influencing voter behavior and hence attempting to influence election outcomes, and creating as much disruption and disarray as possible to undermine social order and cohesion. These campaigns will, unsurprisingly, play out online on mainstream and fringe social media platforms, with commercial and public generative AI tools facilitating these efforts. Since July 13, mainstream and fringe social media have been saturated with commentary, conspiracy theories and charged rhetoric related to the assassination attempt, blending with other election-related misinformation that targets both parties, individual candidates and the integrity of the elections themselves. Similarly, since President Biden\u2019s announcement that he is stepping aside and endorsing Vice President Harris, online commentary featuring the latter has seen a notable uptick across mainstream and fringe social media.\n\nThe final stretch leading up to the election will likely see a notable surge in election-related mis- and disinformation campaigns, targeting both parties, individual candidates up and down the ballot, as well as the integrity of the elections themselves.

Similarly, since President Biden\u2019s announcement that he is stepping aside and endorsing Vice President Harris, online commentary featuring the latter has seen a notable uptick across mainstream and fringe social media. Political groups and activist movements will likely increase the scale and intensity of protests: These next 100 days will take place amid the backdrop of the continued Israel-Hamas war, which currently faces heightened potential of spilling over to an Israel-Hezbollah war. This will further pull in the U.S., Iran and other global players. The reverberations of the war have already been felt across the U.S., with pro-Palestinian and anti-war protests persisting since October 2023. Over the next 100 days, these protests will not only continue, but likely escalate in terms of scale and intensity as groups attempt to keep their calls for a ceasefire and associated demands front and center for both parties and their candidates. A range of other political groups and activist movements, including those advocating for climate action, social justice and reproductive health issues, will follow similar suit. The intensity and frequency of these protests may increase as election day approaches, including in the form of joint protest activity between various groups and movements, as witnessed by collaboration between pro-Palestinian and climate activist groups in recent months.\n\nThese next 100 days will take place amid the backdrop of the continued Israel-Hamas war, which currently faces heightened potential of spilling over to an Israel-Hezbollah war.

Continued targeting of election officials and judges: Over the past four years, there has been a notable trend of targeting election officials physically, digitally and reputationally. Over the next 100 days, election officials and judges are likely to continue to be targeted, including in the form of threats and harassments. The motivations behind these actions are likely to stem from differing political ideologies and discouraging voter turnout in certain locations, as well as seeking to disrupt or challenge the legitimacy of the electoral process. Consistent with trends to date, threats and disruptions will likely take place primarily at the local level, though factors like election-related mis- and disinformation and campaign-related developments could expand the disruption surface.\n\nOver the past four years, there has been a notable trend of targeting election officials physically, digitally and reputationally.

Heightened terrorist threat environment stemming from the war in Gaza: Since the October 7 Hamas attacks in Israel and the Israeli military\u2019s subsequent operations in Gaza, U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies have noted the consistent dissemination of extremist propaganda focused on attacking U.S. targets across the world given the Biden administrations support of Israeli military operations. While developments related to Israeli-Palestinian relations have long been a rallying cry for a variety of foreign terrorist organizations and violent extremist actors, the current war in Gaza has provided renewed fervor to these calls. Much of the world\u2019s attention is focused on the Paris Olympics, with intelligence agencies focused on preventing or disrupting potential terrorist threats targeting the games. As such, foreign terrorist organizations, their supporters and lone actors motivated by a range of ideologies may view this time as an opportunity to attack targets in the U.S. In addition, following the assassination attempt of former President Trump, various groups may attempt to exploit the current tense and uncertain domestic situation to create further disruption.\n\nElection Day Vulnerabilities\n\nAs voters head to the polls on November 5, the primary threat of disruption comes from organized groups attempting to engage in voter intimidation, continued protests, as well as violent clashes stemming from either of these scenarios, as further detailed below:\n\nPotential for voter intimidation by organized groups: A variety of actors, including armed militias, may engage in voter intimidation efforts at polling places, as witnessed during the 2022 mid-term elections. More recently, law enforcement in Milwaukee, WI removed individuals from polling stations for being disruptive. These groups may attempt to intimidate certain members of the electorate or specific demographics from voting or create a hostile environment to deter people from voting.\n\nA variety of actors, including armed militias, may engage in voter intimidation efforts at polling places, as witnessed during the 2022 mid-term elections. More recently, law enforcement in Milwaukee, WI removed individuals from polling stations for being disruptive. These groups may attempt to intimidate certain members of the electorate or specific demographics from voting or create a hostile environment to deter people from voting. Key polling places may serve as hotspots for protests: Polling places, particularly in districts with key electoral races or urban centers that have been the focal point of prior large-scale protests, may become hotspots for demonstrations led by a variety of protest movements. While many of these demonstrations may be pre-planned and include groups that have protested in the lead-up to election day, spontaneous protests may also erupt, potentially driven by accusations of voter suppression, electoral fraud or general political grievances.\n\nPolling places, particularly in districts with key electoral races or urban centers that have been the focal point of prior large-scale protests, may become hotspots for demonstrations led by a variety of protest movements. While many of these demonstrations may be pre-planned and include groups that have protested in the lead-up to election day, spontaneous protests may also erupt, potentially driven by accusations of voter suppression, electoral fraud or general political grievances. Risk of violence is high for election night: Finally, the potential for violence looms over election night/until final votes are counted, either from voter intimidation or protests escalating into clashes, or if the election results prove to be contentious. As election results trickle in and winners are announced, there is an increased risk of confrontations between various groups at polling stations or prominent locations, especially if results are close or disputed, or if there are delays in counting votes. In such scenarios, there is also the potential for spontaneous demonstrations and confrontations, as well as incitements to violence on election night by certain candidates or extremist actors, which could result in organized demonstrations immediately thereafter. As noted in a recent article in Wired magazine, militia leaders \u2013 including those who prominently participated in the January 6 riots at the U.S. Capitol in 2021 \u2013 are already organizing and preparing for potential civil unrest related to the elections.\n\nFinally, the potential for violence looms over election night/until final votes are counted, either from voter intimidation or protests escalating into clashes, or if the election results prove to be contentious.

Amplification of mis- and disinformation and calls for violence: Any of the above scenarios will involve, and be further exacerbated by, online discourse and the amplification of election-outcome-related mis- and disinformation and incitements to violence. Social media and online communications platforms will not only serve as the mediums for the spread of such commentary and incitement, but they will also serve as virtual organizing spaces. This, in turn, can lead to groups mobilizing rapidly and further escalating volatile situations. A scenario similar to the January 6 riots or smaller riots at State Capitols or other government buildings and city landmarks across the country is plausible.\n\nPost-November 5 Domestic Security Landscape\n\nThe post-election security landscape will heavily depend on the outcome of the elections, including outcomes in key senate and congressional races in addition to the presidential contest, as well as any related potential calls for violence. While a detailed post-election threat analysis is premature, one of the below scenarios and immediate implications are likely. This assessment assumes that Kamala Harris is the Democratic Party\u2019s nominee for president.\n\nHarris wins, Trump concedes: In this scenario, the transition of power is likely to be relatively smooth, with efforts from both parties to ensure stability and continuity. Protests and disinformation may persist online and certain groups may mobilize to cause disruptions, but they are less likely if former President Trump concedes and encourages his supporters to accept the election outcome.\n\nIn this scenario, the transition of power is likely to be relatively smooth, with efforts from both parties to ensure stability and continuity.

Harris wins, Trump does not concede: If Vice President Harris wins the presidential election, but former President Trump refuses to concede, the country could face a prolonged period of not just political uncertainty, but one of immense insecurity and volatility. In this scenario, widespread protests and civil unrest may ensue.\n\nIf Vice President Harris wins the presidential election, but former President Trump refuses to concede, the country could face a prolonged period of not just political uncertainty, but one of immense insecurity and volatility. In this scenario, widespread protests and civil unrest may ensue. Trump wins, Harris concedes: Should former President Trump win and Vice President Harris concede, the country\u2019s collective focus will likely shift to the next administration\u2019s policies and the political dynamics in Congress. However, individuals and groups who are in opposition to former President Trump\u2019s platform and policies are likely to continue protesting, leading to the possibility of confrontations between protesters and counter protesters.\n\nShould former President Trump win and Vice President Harris concede, the country\u2019s collective focus will likely shift to the next administration\u2019s policies and the political dynamics in Congress. However, individuals and groups who are in opposition to former President Trump\u2019s platform and policies are likely to continue protesting, leading to the possibility of confrontations between protesters and counter protesters. Trump wins, Harris does not concede: While we assess this scenario to be the least likely, should former President Trump win but Vice President Harris not concede, we expect a similar situation to the second scenario outlined above: political uncertainty, as well as mass demonstrations and calls to action by a variety of actors, including individuals and groups associated with either party. We further anticipate the possibility of some domestic extremist groups mobilizing to pressure Harris to concede; there may also be groups who seek to capitalize on the uncertainty to create chaos and disruption.\n\nHow Should Corporations Prepare?\n\nGiven the highly dynamic and potentially volatile political and security landscape leading up to the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election, we recommend organizations and executives contemplate a multi-faceted strategy aimed at proactively addressing the implications of the potential scenarios outlined above. In addition to considering whether to make internal or public statements in response to these scenarios, organizations should also consider implementing the below recommendations to actively prepare for potential related disruptions to business operations and/or election-related violence.\n\nMonitor critical information and engage in robust anticipatory intelligence analysis: Intelligence functions within organizations should ensure they are utilizing a robust toolkit to collect critical information related to political and security developments in key domestic markets. This information should then be rigorously analyzed to anticipate potential risks and identify potential signposts and indicators of escalation or new threats. Scenario planning that incorporates these signposts and effectively maps out implications and steps to mitigate resulting risks is an important part of such tailored intelligence analysis.\n\nIntelligence functions within organizations should ensure they are utilizing a robust toolkit to collect critical information related to political and security developments in key domestic markets.

Scenario planning that incorporates these signposts and effectively maps out implications and steps to mitigate resulting risks is an important part of such tailored intelligence analysis. Evaluate and update crisis management and incident response plans: Organizations should consider updating emergency response plans to address scenarios such as civil unrest, violent protests and potential attacks on company property, as well as conduct simulation exercises to ensure that all key personnel are familiar with crisis and incident protocols and plans. As part of this, organizations should also consider establishing clear communication channels for disseminating information quickly and effectively to employees and all relevant stakeholders during an incident or prolonged period of crisis.\n\nOrganizations should consider updating emergency response plans to address scenarios such as civil unrest, violent protests and potential attacks on company property, as well as conduct simulation exercises to ensure that all key personnel are familiar with crisis and incident protocols and plans. As part of this, organizations should also consider establishing clear communication channels for disseminating information quickly and effectively to employees and all relevant stakeholders during an incident or prolonged period of crisis. Enhance physical and cybersecurity measures: Organizations should consider strengthening security protocols at company headquarters, branch offices and key facilities \u2013 and evaluate whether measures in support of protection of high-profile executives, board members or other key employees require enhancements. Organizations should also consider increasing cybersecurity efforts to protect against potential cyberattacks that could target company data and communications systems. This should include deployment of multi-factor authentication (MFA) on company-issued devices, ensuring that all systems are up to date with the latest security patches, and confirming that all employees are trained on recognizing phishing attempts and other cyber threats. Organizations should also coordinate with relevant law enforcement and government agencies at both the national and local levels to stay informed about potential risks and coordinate responses as required.\n\nOrganizations should consider strengthening security protocols at company headquarters, branch offices and key facilities \u2013 and evaluate whether measures in support of protection of high-profile executives, board members or other key employees require enhancements.

Prepare for business continuity challenges: Organizations should evaluate and assess whether any alternative suppliers or logistical routes need to be identified to enable redundancies and mitigate the impact of potential disruptions, particularly in the event of a contested election and a scenario where the losing candidate fails to concede. Similarly, organizations should take stock of any critical materials and supplies to maintain operations in case of prolonged domestic disruptions at the local or national level.\n\nOrganizations should evaluate and assess whether any alternative suppliers or logistical routes need to be identified to enable redundancies and mitigate the impact of potential disruptions, particularly in the event of a contested election and a scenario where the losing candidate fails to concede.

Support employee safety and well-being: Finally, organizations should consider providing resources that support employees\u2019 mental health and well-being, recognizing the stress and anxiety that the election period, particularly given recent events, may cause. Members of groups that may feel isolated or targeted might need special accommodation or services during this time. Organizations should also consider being prepared to implement or extend remote working policies to protect employees from potential disruptions or violence in the lead up to, during and in the immediate aftermath of November 5.\n\nBy implementing these recommendations, organizations and executives can better navigate the uncertainties of the election period, safeguard their operations and protect their employees and stakeholders from potential election-related disruptions and violence.

        "text": "Can Harris beat Trump? Presidential prognosticator's preliminary data says yes.\nAllan Lichtman, the presidential election prognosticator who has successfully predicted the last nine out of 10 White House races, has made his preliminary projection for the November contest: Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to win, he said Friday.\n\nLichtman said his final prediction for the White House contest will come in August after the Democratic National Convention, but as of Friday, Harris appears to be the winner based on the formula he uses to forecast the election outcome.\n\nThat formula, his 13 Keys to the White House, was developed by Lichtman and renowned mathematician Vladimir Keilis-Borok in 1981. Since then, it has been used to predict the outcome of the United States presidential contests with a high success rate.\n\nLichtman uses his 13 keys, or criteria, to judge the party that controls the White House's ability to maintain control in an election year. If the White House party is considered to be a success in eight or more of the \"keys,\" then the incumbent party is expected to win. If the incumbent party is viewed as a failure in six or more of the criteria, or \"keys,\" the challenger is expected to win.\n\nLichtman broke down his rating in a recent video podcast. Here's a summary of his preliminary determination:\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nWhat \"keys\" are Harris winning?\n\nHarris, so far, has won eight of the 13 keys. Those include:\n\nKey 2 - No primary contest: Was there a significant challenger or contest to determine the nominee for the incumbent party? No. After President Joe Biden dropped out of the race on Sunday, he endorsed Harris and effectively cleared the field for her to become the presumptive nominee. No significant challengers have arisen from within the party.\n\nKey 4 - No third party: Third parties historically count against the White House party. \"They're a sign of discontent with the way the nation is being governed,\" Lichtman said. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. would need to achieve 5% of the vote to turn this key, and Lichtman says his polling ahead of November would need to stabilize at 10%. Lichtman said it's possible but unlikely that RFK Jr. could achieve those percentages.\n\nKey 5 - Strong short-term economy: No recession has been declared by the National Bureau of Economic Research so far in the election year.\n\nKey 6 - Strong long-term economy: Real economic growth in the term exceeds that of the previous two terms. \"Real\" economic growth means growth that has been adjusted for inflation, Lichtman said. \"The long-term growth under Joe Biden has been vastly greater than the average of the previous two terms,\" he said.\n\nKey 7 - Major policy change: A significant change from the previous administration or a truly historic policy change like the New Deal. \"Clearly, policy under Joe Biden in virtually every realm has been fundamentally different from that of the previous administration of Donald Trump,\" Lichtman said.\n\nKey 8 - No social unrest: \"It can't be sporadic protests like we saw this spring on some college campuses,\" Lichtman said. \"It has to be massive protests or unrest like we saw in the 1960s or during the Black Lives Matter movement when millions of people were out in the streets,\" Lichtman said this key could turn if large forms of social unrest bubble up ahead of or during the Democratic National Convention.\n\nKey 9 - No scandal: Must be some corruption directly involving the president with bipartisan recognition of the scandal as corruption, akin to Watergate.\n\nKey 13 - Uncharismatic challenger: The challenging candidate, former President Donald Trump, is not appealing to voters across party lines.\n\nWhat \"keys\" are Harris losing?",

        "text": "\u2018The Most Important Election of Our Lifetime\u2019\nIllustration by Christianity Today / Source Images: Getty\n\nThis is the most important election of our lifetime.\u201d I\u2019ve heard this said every presidential election in my lifetime, but, this time, the stakes are being raised even higher. The 2024 election is not just the most important\u2014the consequences of it are existential.\n\nAt a fundraiser in February, President Joe Biden called Donald Trump the \u201cone existential threat,\u201d and he has also written on X to constituents: \u201cIn this election, your freedom, your democracy, and America itself is at stake.\u201d Vice President Harris said at an event this month, \u201cThis is the one. The most existential, consequential, and important election of our lifetime.\u201d\n\nFormer president Trump has used this line of argument as well: At the Faith and Freedom Coalition last month, he said that \u201cthis will be the most important election in the history of our country\u201d and \u201cour one chance to save America.\u201d Back in March, he responded to the claim that he was a \u201cthreat to democracy\u201d with, \u201cI\u2019m not a threat.

Sorry, something went wrong. Please try again.\n\nThese talking points might be effective campaigning, but they make for a toxic political culture.\n\nIn college, I competed in policy debate tournaments\u2014a form of debate that focuses more on detailed (and fast-paced) presentation of evidence than rhetoric or performance. We created elaborate argumentative chains, showing how one policy change (subsidies for offshore wind turbines or the legalization of online gambling) could cause a cascading chain of events that nearly always ended in global nuclear war. It was a way of beating the other team: Sure, your proposal might lower inflation or decrease violent crime, but that\u2019s nothing compared to global nuclear war.\n\nOften, we spent more time debating which global extinction scenario was immediately catastrophic than we did debating the merits of the various policies that were supposed to be the topic of the debates. It sounds silly, but, this year, the same thing seems to be happening in our national politics.\n\nWe raised the stakes so high that we often sidestep substantive conversations about policy in favor of weighing apocalyptic scenarios. These existential narratives are often more about scaring people into turning out to the polls than they are about fostering dialogue about important issues.\n\nThis is where Christian theology offers a gift to our politics: an end to existential threats.\n\nFor Christians, nothing is truly a threat to our survival or existence. We are a people who believe Jesus Christ when he promised to return to his fallen creation, to wipe every tear from every eye and to make all things new. We believe that this story we are living does not end in violence, chaos, and strife\u2014it ends with perfect righteousness, justice, and peace.\n\nThe promise of Christ\u2019s return does not demand quietism or political escapism; rather, it should prompt faithful political work that can resist the impulse toward violence and injustice. If Christ is returning to make everything new, prejudiced or brutal political options become less rational, less necessary. If this election poses an existential threat, then we can more easily justify doing anything\u2014including harming our neighbors, lying, stealing, or cheating\u2014to avoid it. But if ultimate justice is promised by God, we have the freedom to seek provisional justice here on earth as faithfully as we can, without fearing that if we fail all is lost.\n\nThis is the theology that motivated some of the greatest movements for justice in our country\u2019s history. The abolitionist Maria W. Stewart was able to hold together a fierce condemnation of slavery with a deep commitment to nonviolence because the end of the story was assured: \u201cStand still, and know that the Lord he is God. Vengeance is his, and he will repay.\u201d\n\nMartin Luther King Jr., perhaps this country\u2019s most famous advocate of nonviolent resistance, was clear that this approach was not merely pragmatic but theological: \u201cThe movement [of nonviolence] was based on hope \u2026 even though the arc of the moral universe is long, it bends toward justice.\u201d\n\nThere has been a lot of talk lately about lowering the heat of our political rhetoric, a recognition that when the issues seem so paramount, we risk reacting with violence. But this wise counsel needs a stronger theological backing.\n\nThe threats, after all, are not imagined or entirely exaggerated. The consequences of this election will be serious, and likely in ways we do not yet know. Lowering the stakes in the face of these threats might diminish the real significance of elections: They shape people\u2019s lives, especially the most vulnerable. It risks communicating to people that politics doesn\u2019t really matter that much, that the human lives that will be affected by the outcome are not worthy of our attention.\n\nBut lowering the stakes because we believe that the end of the Christian story is true is another thing altogether. Lowering the stakes because ultimate justice is not at risk in this election opens up greater opportunities for meaningful change here and now.\n\nTo many in our nation, it feels like the options are between living in a constant state of existential threat and checking out of politics entirely. I\u2019ve heard many bemoan on social media, \u201cCan\u2019t we just live in precedented times?\u201d or \u201cHow many historical events do I have to live through?\u201d We constantly hear that the fate of our country is at stake in this election, but raising the stakes hasn\u2019t seemed to inspire more political involvement.\n\nThe comment I hear most frequently from people in churches and schools across the country is that the fear and anger have exhausted them, tempting them toward total political apathy. We are bombarded with information about the great injustices and evils in the world, alarmed by the conditions of our own political culture, and we feel helpless to do anything about it.\n\nEither we constantly scroll social media for updates on the latest sign of impending political doom, sign up for every political group in town, and take every opportunity to convince our friends and family members about these existential threats\u2014or we throw up our hands, declare the whole political system unfixable, and live in blissful ignorance of the folks who will be more directly affected by the policies we can\u2019t be bothered to research. However, there is an alternative to these options.\n\nAll of these claims\u2014of existential threat, of \u201cliving in historic times,\u201d of democracy teetering on the edge of disaster\u2014are claims about where we sit in history, and what agency that position allows us. If this is the defining moment of history, we should act differently than we would under normal conditions. If democracy is on the ballot, nothing else really matters. If this candidate or party will end our very existence, political options to persuade or negotiate are off the table. All that\u2019s left is to destroy or be destroyed.\n\nBut the Christian story says that we are not awaiting the impending turning point of history from goodness to chaos. The Christian story says that the defining point of history has already happened: the resurrection of Jesus Christ. In light of that victory over the powers and principalities, and in hopeful anticipation of his return to bring that victory to consummation, we have opportunities to effect change in our fallen world. The resurrection of Christ is the horizon of our agency, the event that defines the possibilities for creative and faithful work.\n\nOne of the most frequent biblical themes is that it is not the powerful and important whose actions most matter but the lowly, forgotten, and small. In a political culture that feels hopeless, in a system we feel powerless to change, Scripture offers us stories of surprising agency: of three men who survive a fire when they stand down an idolatrous king, of midwives who save the lives of infants, of a man on a cross who dies a gruesome death but then rises from the grave.\n\nIn the face of an onslaught of existential threats, Christians can proclaim to the world that our options are not between apathy or political violence (Rom. 12:18\u201320).\n\nFreed from the constraints of existential politics and motivated for change, new possibilities appear. We can fight for justice, advocate for the oppressed, and seek flourishing in our own neighborhoods without worrying that if our candidate loses or our advocacy fails it means that our very existence is threatened. And we might just discover that politics has all kinds of places for fruitful work that we previously ignored in our rush to stave off the biggest existential threat.\n\nChristian political action can be bringing a casserole to a neighbor, showing up to a city council meeting, setting up an apartment for a refugee family, writing a letter to an elected official. Within the frame of God\u2019s redemptive story, these small acts of justice and peace take on greater significance than the desperate attempts to bring peace to earth at any cost.\n\nKaitlyn Schiess is the author of The Ballot and the Bible: How Scripture Has Been Used and Abused in American Politics and Where We Go from Here.",

        "text": "US Presidential elections: Barack and Michelle Obama endorse Kamala Harris, giving her expected but crucial support\nFormer President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama have endorsed Kamala Harris in her White House bid, giving the vice president the expected but still crucial backing of the nation\u2019s two most popular Democrats.\n\nThe endorsement, announced Friday morning in a video showing Harris accepting a joint phone call from the former first couple, comes as Harris continues to build momentum as the party\u2019s likely nominee after President Joe Biden\u2019s decision to end his reelection bid and endorse his second-in-command against Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump.\n\nIt also highlights the friendship and potentially historic link between the nation\u2019s first Black president and the first woman, first Black woman and first person of Asian descent to serve as vice president, who is now vying to break those same barriers at the presidential rank.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso Read | Kamala Harris is as African American as Indian American\n\n\u201cWe called to say Michelle and I couldn\u2019t be prouder to endorse you and do everything we can to get you through this election and into the Oval Office,\u201d the former president told Harris, who is shown taking the call as she walks backstage at an event, trailed by a Secret Service agent.\n\nSaid Michelle Obama, \u201cI can\u2019t have this phone call without saying to my girl, Kamala, I am proud of you.\n\n\u201cThis is going to be historic,\u201d she added.\n\nHarris, who has known the Obamas since before his election in 2008, thanked them for their friendship and said she looks forward to \u201cgetting there, being on the road\u201d with them in the three-month blitz before Election Day on Nov. 5.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re gonna have some fun with this too, aren\u2019t we?\u201d Harris said.\n\nI\u2019m so proud of my girl, Kamala. Barack and I are so excited to endorse her as the Democratic nominee because of her positivity, sense of humor, and ability to bring light and hope to people all across the country. We\u2019ve got your back, @KamalaHarris! pic.twitter.com/xldcZeDXuS \u2014 Michelle Obama (@MichelleObama) July 26, 2024\n\nThe Obamas are perhaps the last major party figures to endorse Harris formally \u2014 a reflection of the former president\u2019s desire to remain, at least publicly, a party elder operating above the fray. The Obamas remain prodigious fundraising draws and popular surrogates at large campaign events for Democratic candidates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to an Associated Press survey, Harris already has secured the public support of a majority of delegates to the Democratic National Convention, which begins Aug. 19 in Chicago. The Democratic National Committee expects to hold a virtual nominating vote that would, by Aug. 7, make Harris and a yet-to-be-named running mate the official Democratic ticket.\n\nBiden endorsed Harris within an hour of announcing his decision last Sunday to end his campaign amid widespread concern about the 81-year-old president\u2019s ability to defeat Trump. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, House Minority Whip Jim Clyburn, former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton followed in the days after.\n\nThe Obamas, however, trod carefully as Harris secured the delegate commitments, made the rounds among core Democratic constituencies and raised more than $120 million. The public caution tracks how the former president handled the weeks between Biden\u2019s debate debacle against Trump and the president\u2019s eventual decision to end his campaign: Obama was a certain presence in the party\u2019s maneuvers but he operated quietly.\n\nBarack Obama\u2019s initial statement after Biden\u2019s announcement did not mention Harris. Instead, he spoke generically about coming up with a nominee to succeed Biden: \u201cI have extraordinary confidence that the leaders of our party will be able to create a process from which an outstanding nominee emerges,\u201d the former president wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth Obamas campaigned separately for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Biden in 2020, including large rallies on the closing weekends before Election Day. They delivered key speeches at the Democrats\u2019 convention in 2020, a virtual event because of the coronavirus pandemic. The former president\u2019s speech was especially notable because he unveiled a full-throated attack on Trump as a threat to democracy, an argument that endures as part of Harris\u2019 campaign.",

As a nation, we have become so used to the endless campaign that it has become virtually impossible to imagine that there could be any period of time free from intense electioneering.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden\u2019s withdrawal from the 2024 election and Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019s rapid ascent have raised concerns as to whether Democrats can run a successful campaign in only three months. As a nation, we have become so used to the endless campaign that it has become virtually impossible to imagine that there could be any period of time free from intense electioneering.\n\nBut the unusual circumstances of 2024 give the nation an opportunity to test the status quo and see whether a shorter, more targeted campaign might actually be a more effective path toward victory\u2014and simultaneously healthier for the democracy.\n\nAmerican presidential elections are much longer than in other countries. Many nations have laws on the books that strictly curtail how long campaigns can be.\n\nLess well known is the fact that American elections were not always this long, either. In 1896, Republican William McKinley famously campaigned from the front porch of his home in Ohio and won election as president. Although candidates would compete in primaries since their advent in the early 20th century, most only did a handful, if any, and they were only testing grounds for the summer party conventions where the machine would select the nominee. In 1968, President Lyndon B. Johnson didn\u2019t even file in the New Hampshire primary.\n\nThe duration of the presidential campaign cycle has vastly expanded since the early 1970s. Political reform following the tumultuous 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago was an important factor behind the change. Democrats were shaken as anti-war protesters clashed with party leaders over the disastrous conflict in Vietnam. Violent confrontations unfolded on the streets where Mayor Richard J. Daley\u2019s police attacked protesters with brutal force.\n\nRather than allowing party operatives to keep picking the nominees in smoke-filled rooms, Sen. George McGovern and Rep. Donald Fraser successfully proposed reforms that made primaries, as well as caucuses, the contests in which voters would determine who sat atop the ticket. And when former Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter figured out in 1976 how to use the Iowa caucus as a way to build the perception of being a front-runner, the official kick-off for presidential campaigns became January of election year. Republicans embraced the McGovern-Fraser reforms and moved away from party machines as well. Very quickly, candidates started to prepare even earlier as they wanted to make sure to do well in Iowa as well as the New Hampshire primary so as to receive the boost of an early victory.\n\nBut there was more at work than the nomination process. Money mattered as well. In the aftermath of Watergate, reformers attempted to curb the growing influence of money in elections. In 1974, Congress passed reforms that created contribution limits, a system of voluntary public finance for presidential elections (if a presidential candidate accepted public funds, they had to adhere to spending limits), spending limitations, more stringent disclosure rules, and a Federal Elections Commission.\n\nBut the reforms failed to stop the escalating costs of elections. In particular, television spots placed enormous pressure on candidates\u2019 budgets. By 2020, presidential and congressional elections cost a whopping $14 billion. The amount spent was greater than the GDPs of some smaller countries. Moreover, the Watergate reforms gradually weakened. In 1976, the Supreme Court knocked down spending limitations on the grounds that they violated free speech. Parties found ways to obtain money through political action committees and nonprofit entities while presidential candidates from the major parties decided not to accept public funds so that they could spend as much private money as they wanted to.\n\nSome candidates and consultants half-joked that presidential campaigns usually started the minute after an inauguration ended.\n\nThere was another reason why television worked to lengthen the duration of campaigns. In the 1980s, cable networks formed that were devoted entirely to news (CNN launched in 1980, MSNBC and Fox News started in 1996). In contrast to the era of network news, when the 30-minute evening news shows were sandwiched between daytime soap operas and prime-time variety shows, these channels offered a continuous stream of news. The networks made their money through advertising, so they looked for stories that could garner high viewership. The horse-race coverage of political campaigns offered perfect content, providing the thrill of a sporting event with much higher stakes. Over time, and combined with the internet and then social media, permanent news outlets craved campaign stories to fill the airwaves. Short breaking news segments, town halls, one-on-one interviews, and 60- to 90-minute debates were constant and became requirements for serious candidates.\n\nWith all of these forces coming together, the American presidential campaign\u2014usually much longer than what occurred overseas\u2014grew even lengthier.\n\nThere have been significant consequences, many detrimental. Perhaps most important is the creation of an endless money cycle. Candidates start campaigns earlier to raise money, while the longer a campaign takes the more money needs to be spent. The permanent campaign likewise ensures that electoral pressures will place constant and intense pressure on every deliberation that takes place in Washington. There are no moments when electoral pressures ebb to create more space for sober policymaking. Elected officials and their challengers can never afford to take their eyes off the hustings.\n\nThen there is the problem of voter fatigue. In July 2016, 59 percent of voters reported feeling exhausted by election coverage, with the numbers even worse among those who weren\u2019t following as closely. Some respond by simply tuning out.\n\nThe possibility of obtaining any kind of change through reform is unlikely. There is not much evidence, for instance, that serious consideration would be given to enacting laws limiting how long a candidate can campaign for, nor would such laws be likely to survive constitutional challenge. It would also be difficult for the political parties to move away from a system built around primaries and caucuses back to something like what we had before 1968. Even the speed through which Harris secured her candidacy has caused concern of an undemocratic \u201ccoronation\u201d taking place. The odds for substantive campaign finance reform are low, and the 24-hour news media only keeps getting more entrenched. When some experts have proposed combining more primaries and caucuses in Super Tuesday-style days, there has been resistance from states that prefer to drag out the process.\n\nThis is why Harris\u2019s campaign is so interesting. Should Harris be able to put together an effective campaign in a few months and defeat former President Donald Trump, she has the potential to demonstrate in practice that a shorter campaign is not only possible but perhaps more effective in our current age.\n\nThe question on the table is whether, in a period when the public is so inundated with political news, there might be something strategically effective in concentrating the amount of time devoted to the meat of the campaign. In an era with so much content\u2014from entertainment to politics\u2014a more dramatic, attenuated campaign period could garner the kind of public attention that longer elections fail to achieve. With a shorter time frame, perhaps elections become the kind of focusing events that engage and excite voters, rather than something from which they tune out. A faster and more nimble campaign might also make it harder for opponents to develop sustained smear attacks that build over time. Ideally, in the long run, shorter campaigns could decrease the amount of time candidates who are elected officials spend on fundraising, as opposed to governing. Obviously, it might also be that the short campaign is not effective. Certainly, a victory by Trump in November would lead Democrats to that very conclusion, as they will blame Biden for waiting so long before handing over the keys.\n\nRegardless, the unusual and unprecedented nature of this contest should be an opportunity for Americans to have a serious conversation about whether our campaigns really need to be, and should be, as lengthy as they have become\u2014or whether our democracy would benefit from a campaign cycle that is succinct, lean, concentrated, and not unending. Sometimes in life, shorter is better. Maybe our democracy can benefit from a little less, rather than more and more.",

        "text": "Kamala Harris makes history as whirlwind week upends US election\nThe telephone line was a little fuzzy, and the voice on the end gravelly from several days of Covid isolation. Yet the poignancy of the message, and the moment itself, could not have been clearer: \u201cI\u2019m watching you, kid. I love you,\u201d the speaker said.\n\nJoe Biden\u2019s warmhearted call to his vice-president, Kamala Harris, at the Democratic party\u2019s campaign headquarters in Delaware on Monday marked a generational shift in US politics, a symbolic passing of the torch from parent to progeny.\n\nIn terms of the 2024 presidential election race it was also a defining moment. Harris, a former prosecutor, state attorney general, California senator, and for three and a half years the 81-year-old Biden\u2019s White House understudy, was appearing for the first time as her party\u2019s preferred new candidate, less than 24 hours after her boss\u2019s stunning announcement that he would not seek a second term of office sent a seismic shock across the country.\n\nThere followed what by any metric could be called a whirlwind week on the campaign trail in an extraordinary month in American history already notable for the attempted assassination of former president Donald Trump, the Republican party\u2019s candidate for the 5 November election.\n\nBy Wednesday, Harris was addressing an historically Black sorority in Indianapolis as the Democratic presumptive nominee, having secured the support of enough delegates at the party\u2019s national convention in Chicago next month to clinch the nomination.\n\nIt was the same day as Biden gave an emotional, nationally televised address from the White House explaining his decision to step aside \u201cin defense of democracy\u201d.\n\n\u201cI revere this office, but I love my country more,\u201d he said, urging the country to stand behind Harris.\n\nOne by one, other heavyweight Democratic figures had stepped up to endorse her, culminating on Friday with the outsized backing of Barack Obama. The former speaker Nancy Pelosi, Hillary Clinton, all 23 of the party\u2019s state governors, and elected officials from the most junior Congress members to Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer, respectively the House minority leader and Senate majority leader, also gave their approval.\n\n\u201cWe are not playing around,\u201d Harris told supporters at the sorority gathering in Indiana on Wednesday.\n\nView image in fullscreen Kamala Harris and the second gentleman, Douglas Emhoff, kiss onstage at Harris\u2019s presidential campaign headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware, on Tuesday. Photograph: Erin Schaff/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\u201cThere is so much at stake in this moment. Our nation, as it always has, is counting on you to energize, to organize, and to mobilize; to register folks to vote, to get them to the polls; and to continue to fight for the future our nation and her people deserve.\n\n\u201cWe know when we organize, mountains move. When we mobilize, nations change. And when we vote, we make history.\u201d\n\nIt was a rousing speech from a politician who only three days previously was still in a supporting role, despite weeks of swirling speculation about Biden\u2019s future following his disastrous debate performance against Trump in June.\n\nBut things moved swiftly once the president\u2019s decision to step aside was announced on Sunday afternoon. The Biden campaign apparatus, and election war chest of almost $100m (\u00a377.6m), became the property of a new entity called Harris for President (Republicans have vowed to challenge the funds transfer in court).\n\nAnd staff hastily drew up a new travel schedule for the vice-president, which saw her crisscrossing the country, including the Wilmington, Delaware, appearance on Monday, at which she acknowledged the \u201crollercoaster\u201d of the previous 24 hours.\n\nOn Tuesday, she was rallying in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, with the campaign message: \u201cWe\u2019re not going back\u201d to the \u201cchaos\u201d of the Trump years.\n\nView image in fullscreen Kamala Harris speaks to supporters during a campaign rally in West Allis, Wisconsin, on Tuesday. Photograph: Jim Vondruska/Getty Images\n\nOn Wednesday, to Black women in Indianapolis, Indiana, she said: \u201cWe face a choice between two different visions for our nation: one focused on the future, the other focused on the past.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, she told teachers in Houston, Texas: \u201cIn our vision, we see a place where every person has the opportunity not just to get by, but to get ahead.\u201d\n\nAlso on Thursday came her first meeting with a foreign leader \u2013 Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu \u2013 in her own right as a presidential candidate, not in a joint summit as vice-president. In a White House statement issued in her name, not Biden\u2019s, Harris condemned violence at Wednesday\u2019s anti-Netanyahu protest in Washington DC and the burning of the US flag.\n\nIn forceful public remarks following the meeting , she also went further than Biden ever had to criticize civilian suffering in Gaza. \u201cI will not be silent,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIsrael has a right to defend itself \u2026 [but] we cannot look away in the face of these tragedies. We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering.\u201d\n\nActivities behind the scenes, meanwhile, progressed every bit as quickly as Harris\u2019s front-of-house appearances.\n\nFundraising operations cranked up, pulling in an all-time record $81m for any 24-hour period in presidential campaign history, a windfall for the newly branded Harris Victory Fund that surpassed $130m, mostly from small or first-time donors, by Thursday night.\n\nSeizing on enthusiasm from younger voters that polling found was conspicuously absent for Biden, or the 78-year-old Trump, Harris\u2019s team also released to social media its first campaign video. Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s 2016 hit Freedom, the unofficial anthem of Harris for President, provided the soundtrack for a message countering what it says was Trump\u2019s \u201cchaos, fear and hate\u201d vision for the country.\n\nView image in fullscreen People raise signs in support of Kamala Harris as she speaks at a campaign event at West Allis high school in West Allis, Wisconsin, on Tuesday. Photograph: Kevin Mohatt/Reuters\n\nHarris has enormous appeal with generation Z, noted by backing from numerous youth organizations, including March for Our Lives, the student activist group formed in the aftermath of the 2018 mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida.\n\nThere could have been no better illustration than the declaration on X/Twitter by the British singer Charli xcx that \u201ckamala IS brat\u201d. Viewed by more than 53 million people, the simple message encapsulating a pop culture lifestyle delighted the younger generation and confounded their elders in equal measure. \u201cYou just got to go listen to that Charli xcx album and then you\u2019ll understand it,\u201d Florida\u2019s Maxwell Frost, the first gen Z member of Congress, told CNN.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s coconut trees or talking about brat or whatever, the message is getting across to tens of millions of young people across the entire country, and across the entire world, and that\u2019s really inspiring.\u201d\n\nWrongfooted by Biden\u2019s abrupt exit, and alarmed by polls showing Harris gaining ground or even surpassing Trump in popularity, the former president\u2019s campaign scrambled to find attack lines for their new opponent.\n\nAt a rally in Charlotte, North Carolina, on Wednesday, Trump tested insults including calling Harris a \u201cradical left lunatic\u201d and \u201cthe most incompetent and far-left vice-president in American history\u201d. Republican party acolytes have also been busy with racist attacks, accusing Harris, who has Black and Asian heritage, of being \u201ca DEI [diversity, equity and inclusion] hire\u201d or \u201cunqualified\u201d for the presidency.\n\nView image in fullscreen Kamala Harris, walking left, waves as she arrives to speak during the American Federation of Teachers\u2019 88th national convention in Houston on Thursday. Photograph: Tony Gutierrez/AP\n\nExperts warn to expect an all-out attack of misogyny and racism on Harris as the election approaches.\n\nThis week, however, while Harris\u2019s fledgling campaign took its first steps, it was sharpening its own knives. Framing the upcoming campaign as \u201cthe prosecutor versus the felon\u201d, it took swipes at Trump\u2019s 34 felony convictions on fraud charges, and in a searing missive on Thursday mocked the former president\u2019s rambling anti-Harris diatribe on a rightwing news channel by issuing a \u201cstatement on a 78-year-old criminal\u2019s Fox News appearance\u201d. The gloves are off.\n\nNow, with the first full, buoyant week of Harris\u2019s presidential challenge about to be in the history books, the question is whether the initial enthusiasm and momentum can be maintained through the gruelling 101 days left until the election.\n\nHarris and her team are confident it can. Contradicting the statement by the liberal British politician Joseph Chamberlain more than a century ago that \u201cin politics, there is no use looking beyond the next fortnight\u201d, they have their sights set not only on November\u2019s election, but the eight years beyond it.",

        "text": "July 27, 2024, presidential campaign news\nRepublican presidential nominee and former U.S. President Donald Trump gestures during a rally in St. Cloud, Minnesota, on July 27. Carlos Osorio/Reuters\n\nFormer President Donald Trump painted his new chief rival, Kamala Harris, as worse than President Joe Biden at a Saturday night rally, calling her \u201cthe most incompetent, unpopular and far-left vice president in American history.\u201d\n\nMoments into his remarks in St. Cloud, Minnesota, Trump again blamed a deadly rocket attack in the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights earlier in the day on the \u201cincompetent Biden-Harris administration.\u201d\n\nHe then quickly pivoted to Harris, calling her the \u201cborder czar,\u201d as Republicans have been hammering the presumptive Democratic nominee over how she has handled her task of stemming the root causes of migration. \u201cShe\u2019s terrible. She\u2019s worse \u2026 she\u2019s worse than he is,\u201d Trump said of Harris and Biden.\n\nTrump compared Biden to a fighter who was \u201cbadly beaten\u201d and taken out of the fight.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s losing. Then, they took him out of the fight, and they put in a new fighter. We have a new victim now, Kamala, we have a new victim. We have a brand-new victim. And honestly, she\u2019s a radical left-wing person,\u201d he said, later reiterating his accusation that Democrats staged a \u201ccoup\u201d as Biden stepped aside and endorsed Harris.\n\nTrump continued upon earlier remarks by his running mate, JD Vance, as he slammed Harris\u2019 political record, saying that she \u201cdestroyed San Francisco\u201d as county district attorney.\n\n\u201cA crazy liberal like Kamala Harris gets in, the American dream is dead,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump went after Harris on topics that included abortion, gun policy, climate change, entitlement programs and inflation. In a less substantive dig, he also mocked Harris\u2019 laugh, claiming that the media was trying to portray her as a \u201cMargaret Thatcher,\u201d referring to the late British prime minister, but that \u201cit\u2019s not gonna happen,\u201d because \u201cMargaret Thatcher didn\u2019t laugh like that.\u201d\n\nThough Trump still did partake in his usual mocking of Biden, including by imitating the president playing golf, he acknowledged that the hits weren\u2019t as effective now that Biden had dropped out of the race.\n\nTrump also drew a contrast between himself and Harris by recalling the racial justice protests in 2020 after the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis.\n\n\u201cEvery voter in Minnesota needs to know that when the violent mobs of anarchists and looters and Marxists came to burn down Minneapolis four years ago. \u2026 Remember me? I couldn\u2019t get your governor to act,\u201d he said, again falsely claiming that he, not Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, activated the National Guard in response to the protests.\n\n\u201cI sent in the National Guard to save Minneapolis, while Kamala Harris sided with the arsonists and rioters and raised money to bail out the criminals,\u201d he said, referring to a 2020 tweet from Harris encouraging donations to bail out protesters.

        "text": "Barack Obama, wife Michelle endorse Kamala Harris for US president\nFormer US President Barack Obama and wife Michelle on Friday endorsed incumbent vice president Kamala Harris for the post of US president. Barack Obama and wife Michelle have endorsed Kamala Harris in the US Presidential elections\n\n\u201cEarlier this week, Michelle and I called our friend @KamalaHarris . We told her we think she\u2019ll make a fantastic President of the United States, and that she has our full support. At this critical moment for our country, we\u2019re going to do everything we can to make sure she wins in November. We hope you\u2019ll join us,\u201d Obama posted on X.\n\n\n\nMichelle Obama, the former First Lady, said,\"I\u2019m so proud of my girl, Kamala. Barack and I are so excited to endorse her as the Democratic nominee because of her positivity, sense of humor, and ability to bring light and hope to people all across the country. We\u2019ve got your back.\"\n\n\n\nHarris, 59, has secured enough pledged delegates to clinch the Democratic presidential nomination, this days after incumbent president Joe Biden opted out of the presidential race.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt has been the greatest honour of my life to serve as your President. And while it has been my intention to seek re-election, I believe it is in the best interest of my party the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term,\u201d Biden had said in a letter.\n\n\n\nBoth Barack and Michelle Obama had campaigned separately for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Biden in 2020, including large rallies on the closing weekends before Election Day.\n\n\n\nALSO READ: What made Joe Biden drop out of presidential race? Inside \u2018last-minute\u2019 bombshell exit\n\nBiden had taken the decision amid mounting pressure from the Democrats asking him not to run for a second term. The Democrats were alarmed by his debate performance against Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump that amplified worries that the oldest US president would not be able to win the election at age 81.\n\nBiden served two terms as Obama\u2019s vice president, a selection which pulled him out of the Senate and thrust him onto the national stage.\n\nWhile Obama had earlier defended Biden\u2019s decision to seek reelection, he privately conveyed to allies that his one-time running mate\u2019s path was more challenging after the calamitous debate, the Washington Post reported.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Trump and Harris enter 99-day sprint to decide an election that has suddenly transformed\nST. CLOUD, Minn. (AP) \u2014 Barely a week ago, a sense of inevitability hung over the U.S. presidential election.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s allies gleefully predicted a landslide victory during a Republican National Convention that felt more like a coronation for a nominee who had just survived an assassination attempt and was promising to unite the country. Democrats, desperate and listless, feared the worst as a diminished President Joe Biden clung to his party\u2019s nomination.\n\nBut over the last seven days, a week unlike any other in American history, the 2024 presidential contest has been transformed. And now, just 99 days before Election Day, a fundamentally new race is taking shape featuring new candidates, a new issue focus and a new outlook for both parties.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris stepped in for Biden last Sunday and quickly smashed fundraising records, took over social media and generated levels of excitement that some Democrats said reminded them of the energy that surrounded Barack Obama\u2019s historic candidacy nearly two decades ago.\n\n\u201cThis is potentially Obama on steroids,\u201d said Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, who was among 40,000 participants on a Black Women for Harris call last week.\n\nOn the other side, Republicans are suddenly fearful and frustrated as they begin to accept the new reality that Trump\u2019s victory is no sure thing. And as their mood sours, the finger pointing has begun. Some prominent conservatives are openly second-guessing Trump\u2019s vice presidential pick, JD Vance, a little-known Ohio senator with less than two years in office and a well-documented history of provocative statements.\n\nWhat to know about Trump\u2019s second term:\n\nStaffing the administration: Here are the people Trump has picked recess appointments Follow all of our coverage as Donald Trump assembles his second administration.\n\nJust 12 days ago, Vance earned a huge ovation as he addressed the RNC in Milwaukee, where there was a strong belief that Trump could do no wrong in the wake of his near-death experience.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re light years away from where we were in Milwaukee,\u201d said Republican National Committee member Henry Barbour, who just a week ago predicted that the GOP might win the national popular vote this fall for the first time since 2004. He\u2019s not so sure anymore.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats now have a candidate who can speak, who can attack. They have a weapon,\u201d Barbour said. \u201cThey have a path.\u201d\n\nConventional wisdom is often wrong\n\nThe incredible speed with which the election was transformed is a stark reminder that, in the Trump era, little is certain, and the conventional wisdom is often wrong. Even now, the Democrats\u2019 newfound confidence may be premature. Early public polling suggests that Harris starts in a slightly better position against Trump than Biden was just before his withdrawal from the race. But the numbers also point to a very close race in a deeply divided nation.\n\nMeanwhile, there are still more questions than answers about the 99-day sprint that lies ahead.\n\nHarris has yet to select a running mate. Trump has introduced new uncertainty about the prospect of the next debate slated for Sept. 10 and hosted by ABC, arguing that was part of a deal arranged with Biden. Third-party candidates could still take the race in unexpected directions. And more than a billion dollars in political advertising has yet to be broadcast as both parties re-think their message, their policies and their path to 270 electoral votes.\n\nBut the shift over the last week is undeniable.\n\nHarris raised a record-smashing $200 million in the seven days since taking over Biden\u2019s campaign, with two-thirds of the haul coming from first-time contributors, her campaign said on Sunday. Over the same period, more than 170,000 volunteers have signed up to help the de facto Democratic nominee with phone banking, canvassing and other get-out-the-vote efforts.\n\nDemocrats up and down the ballot have benefited from the unprecedented surge.\n\nJohn Anzalone, a former Biden pollster, described Harris\u2019 candidacy as \u201ca defibrillator\u201d for Democrats and swing voters across the nation. \u201cWe\u2019re back in the game, baby!\u201d\n\nSen. Tammy Baldwin, a Wisconsin Democrat, did not attend Biden\u2019s four most recent visits to her state this year. But she was at Harris\u2019 side for the vice president\u2019s opening political rally last Wednesday.\n\nSimilarly in Michigan, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who was Biden\u2019s national campaign co-chair, was unwilling to break away from her book tour to join the president in Michigan at a critical moment earlier in the month. Whitmer will co-headline an event for the Harris campaign in Pennsylvania on Monday, having already campaigned on her behalf in New Hampshire over the weekend.\n\nAnd the conversation has been profoundly altered.\n\nNo longer are Democrats consumed by questions about their nominee\u2019s age and mental acuity. Instead, they\u2019re leaning into issues that allow them to go on offense. As a woman, Harris has focused on the GOP\u2019s fight against abortion rights in a way that Biden could not. And as a former prosecutor, she has seized on Trump\u2019s criminal conviction in New York with confidence.\n\nHarris has also leaned into a more folksy and emotional criticism of Trump and Vance; she and her allies have begun to describe the Republican presidential ticket as \u201cjust plain weird.\u201d\n\nTrump has abandoned his magnanimous tone\n\nMeanwhile, a frustrated Trump has abandoned the magnanimous tone he sought to project in the days after an assassin\u2019s bullet nearly ended his life.\n\n\u201cThey all say, \u2018I think he\u2019s changed. I think he\u2019s changed since two weeks ago. Something affected him,\u2019\u201d Trump told a massive crowd Saturday night in Minnesota. \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t changed. Maybe I\u2019ve gotten worse, because I get angry at the incompetence that I witness every single day.\u201d\n\nFor now, the Republican former president and his supporters have adopted a kitchen-sink strategy as they figure out which attacks are most effective against their new Democratic opponent.\n\nSome conservatives, especially in the pro-Trump MAGA wing of the party, are calling Harris a \u201cDEI candidate,\u201d referencing \u201cdiversity, equity and inclusion\u201d to suggest Democrats only embraced her as the likely nominee because of her gender and race. House leaders on Capitol Hill have discouraged such criticism, which is largely seen as racist and sexist, but the MAGA movement has not relented.\n\nIn Minnesota over the weekend, Trump and Vance described Harris as a \u201cradical left lunatic,\u201d who wants to de-fund the police, destroy the American dream, allow immigrants in the country illegally to vote and ban fracking. Harris\u2019 team pushed back against the attacks.\n\nTrump also devoted a substantial amount of his remarks to Biden, seemingly struggling to move on from the opponent he has been fixated on since losing the 2020 election.\n\nVoters who packed into the Minnesota rally were largely upbeat about Trump\u2019s chances this fall \u2014 even in their state, which Republicans have lost in every presidential election since 1976. Sensing a shift, however, some questioned whether Harris at the top of the ticket might make the race closer.\n\n\u201cThat makes me a little nervous,\u201d said Jim Caldwell, a 59-year-old truck driver who lives in a city about 40 minutes away from St. Cloud. He pointed to the historic nature of Harris\u2019 candidacy that \u201cmight bring out more people.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople are going to want the first woman,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the one.\u201d\n\nJohn Jose, a 56-year-old associate pastor from St. Cloud, said he was optimistic, especially because of the upheaval on the Democratic side. He also described the last week or two as \u201cdramatic.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we need stability right now,\u201d Jose said.\n\n___\n\nAP writers Lisa Mascaro and Emily Swanson in Washington contributed to this report.",

He doesn't care about what I said eight years ago. He cares about whether we together [and] can govern the country successful.\u201d\n\nWhen asked again if the two have talked about the subject, specifically in the last week since his comments have resurfaced, Vance admitted that they haven't spoken about it and their conversations have focused on the race ahead.\n\n-ABC News' Kelsey Walsh, Soorin Kim and Hannah Demissie",

Their hope was boosted by purported exit polls showing a healthy margin of victory for Gonz\u00e1lez. Exit polls are not allowed under Venezuelan law.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"I'm so happy,\" said Merling Fern\u00e1ndez, a 31-year-old bank employee, as a representative for the opposition campaign walked out of one voting center in a working class neighborhood of Caracas to announce results showing Gonz\u00e1lez more than doubled Maduro's vote count. Dozens standing nearby erupted in an impromptu rendition of the national anthem.\n\n\"This is the path toward a new Venezuela,\" added Fern\u00e1ndez, holding back tears. \"We are all tired of this yoke.\"\n\nMaduro supporters were not showing any signs of throwing in the towel, however.\n\n\"We can't give results, but we can show face,\" a smiling Jorge Rodriguez, campaign chief for Maduro, said at a press conference.\n\nPolls were supposed to begin closing at 6 p.m. but more than three hours after the deadline some voting centers in Caracas remained open and authorities were silent. The opposition called for the National Electoral Council to begin counting ballots.\n\n\"This is the decisive moment,\" Machado, flanked by Gonz\u00e1lez, told reporters at their campaign headquarters.\n\ntoggle caption Matias Delacroix/AP\n\nMachado was careful not to claim victory before authorities announce results but said she had already received copies of some official voting tallies and they indicated a record turnout \u2014 exactly what the opposition needed to overcome Maduro's well-greased electoral machine.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nGonz\u00e1lez was similarly enthused, congratulating Venezuelans on the \"historic\" day and urging supporters to \"celebrate in peace.\"\n\nEarlier, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris offered her support. \"The United States stands with the people of Venezuela who expressed their voice in today's historic presidential election.,\" Harris wrote on X. \"The will of the Venezuelan people must be respected.\"\n\nA few Maduro allies were also projecting confidence.\n\n\"The ballot boxes express what the streets said during these past few months of campaigning,\" Maduro's son, lawmaker Nicolas Maduro Guerra, said on X as night fell on the capital. \"Victory for the Venezuelan people.\"\n\nBut in the absence of any order to close polls, their optimism rang hollow.\n\nVoters started lining up at some voting centers across the country before dawn Sunday, sharing water, coffee and snacks for several hours.\n\nThe election will have ripple effects throughout the Americas, with government opponents and supporters alike signaling their interest in joining the exodus of 7.7 million Venezuelans who have already left their homes for opportunities abroad should Maduro win another six year term.\n\nAuthorities set Sunday's election to coincide with what would have been the 70th birthday of former President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, the revered leftist firebrand who died of cancer in 2013, leaving his Bolivarian revolution in the hands of Maduro. But Maduro and his United Socialist Party of Venezuela are more unpopular than ever among many voters who blame his policies for crushing wages, spurring hunger, crippling the oil industry and separating families due to migration.\n\nMaduro, 61, is facing off against an opposition that has managed to line up behind a single candidate after years of intraparty divisions and election boycotts that torpedoed their ambitions to topple the ruling party.\n\nMachado was blocked by the Maduro-controlled supreme court from running for any office for 15 years. A former lawmaker, she swept the opposition's October primary with over 90% of the vote. After she was blocked from joining the presidential race, she chose a college professor as her substitute on the ballot, but the National Electoral Council also barred her from registering. That's when Gonz\u00e1lez, a political newcomer, was chosen.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nSunday's ballot also features eight other candidates challenging Maduro, but only Gonz\u00e1lez threatens Maduro's rule.\n\nAfter voting, Maduro said he would recognize the election result and urged all other candidates to publicly declare that they would do the same.\n\n\"No one is going to create chaos in Venezuela,\" Maduro said. \"I recognize and will recognize the electoral referee, the official announcements and I will make sure they are recognized.\"\n\nVenezuela sits atop the world's largest proven oil reserves, and once boasted Latin America's most advanced economy. But it entered into a free fall after Maduro took the helm. Plummeting oil prices, widespread shortages and hyperinflation that soared past 130,000% led first to social unrest and then mass emigration.\n\nEconomic sanctions from the U.S. seeking to force Maduro from power after his 2018 reelection \u2014 which the U.S. and dozens of other countries condemned as illegitimate \u2014 only deepened the crisis.\n\nMaduro's pitch to voters this election is one of economic security, which he tried to sell with stories of entrepreneurship and references to a stable currency exchange and lower inflation rates. The International Monetary Fund forecasts the economy will grow 4% this year \u2014 one of the fastest in Latin America \u2014 after having shrunk 71% from 2012 to 2020.\n\nBut most Venezuelans have not seen any improvement in their quality of life. Many earn under $200 a month, which means families struggle to afford essential items. Some work second and third jobs. A basket of basic staples \u2014 sufficient to feed a family of four for a month \u2014 costs an estimated $385.\n\nJudith Cantilla, 52, voted to change those conditions.\n\n\"For me, change in Venezuela (is) that there are jobs, that there's security, there's medicine in the hospitals, good pay for the teachers, for the doctors,\" she said, casting her ballot in the working-class Petare neighborhood of Caracas.\n\nElsewhere, Liana Ibarra, a manicurist in greater Caracas, got in line at 3 a.m. Sunday with her water, coffee and cassava snack-laden backpack only to find at least 150 people ahead of her.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"There used to be a lot of indifference toward elections, but not anymore,\" Ibarra said.\n\nShe said that if Gonz\u00e1lez loses, she will ask her relatives living in the U.S. to sponsor her and her son's application to legally emigrate there. \"We can't take it anymore,\" she said.\n\nThe opposition has tried to seize on the huge inequalities arising from the crisis, during which Venezuelans abandoned their country's currency, the bolivar, for the U.S. dollar.\n\nGonz\u00e1lez and Machado focused much of their campaigning on Venezuela's vast hinterland, where the economic activity seen in Caracas in recent years didn't materialize. They promised a government that would create sufficient jobs to attract Venezuelans living abroad to return home and reunite with their families.\n\nAfter voting at a church-adjacent poll site in an upper-class Caracas neighborhood, Gonz\u00e1lez called on the country's armed forces to respect \"the decision of our people.\"\n\n\"What we see today are lines of joy and hope,\" Gonz\u00e1lez, 74, told reporters. \"We will change hatred for love. We will change poverty for progress. We will change corruption for honesty. We will change goodbyes for reunions.\"\n\nAn April poll by Caracas-based Delphos said about a quarter of Venezuelans were thinking about emigrating if Maduro wins Sunday. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.\n\nMost Venezuelans who migrated over the past 11 years settled in Latin America and the Caribbean. In recent years, many began setting their sights on the U.S.\n\nBoth campaigns have distinguished themselves not only for the political movements they represent but also on how they have addressed voters' hopes and fears.\n\nMaduro's campaign rallies featured lively electronic merengue dancing as well as speeches attacking his opponents. But after he caught heat from leftist allies such as Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva for a comment about a \"bloodbath\" should he lose, Maduro recoiled. His son told the Spanish newspaper El Pais that the ruling party would peacefully hand over the presidency if it loses \u2014 a rare admission of vulnerability out of step with Maduro campaign's triumphalist tone.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIn contrast, the rallies of Gonz\u00e1lez and Machado prompted people to cry and chant \" Freedom! Freedom! \" as the duo passed by. People handed the devout Catholics rosaries, walked along highways and went through military checkpoints to reach their events. Others video-called their relatives who have migrated to let them catch a glimpse of the candidates.\n\n\"We do not want more Venezuelans leaving, and to those who have left I say that we will do everything possible to get them back here, and we will welcome them with open arms,\" Gonz\u00e1lez said Sunday.\n\nAssociated Press writer Fabiola S\u00e1nchez contributed to this report.\n\n",

        "text": "We're 100 days away from the U.S. presidential election. An expert predicts what will happen next\nIn the week U.S. President Joe Biden announced his departure from the upcoming U.S. election, prospective candidate and Vice-President Kamala Harris fundraised US$200 million and 170,000 volunteers signed up to help her campaign.\n\nBut what can we expect in the now 100 days leading up to Election Day?\n\nFor Democrats, even though the Democratic National Convention (DNC) is set to take place in Chicago later in August, political and social commentator Avis Jones-DeWeever says their eyes will be on what takes place Aug. 7.\n\n\"What's happening on Aug. 7 is when Vice-President Harris will become officially the candidate for the Democratic party, there's going to be a virtual meeting where the delegates can actually vote virtually prior to the convention and they need to do that in order to meet certain state deadlines to get her on the ballot in all 50 states,\" DeWeever said during an interview with CTV News Channel that aired Sunday morning.\n\nThe virtual meeting will also reveal who will join Harris as her running mate on the official Democratic ticket.\n\nOnly then will everyone turn their focus toward the DNC, DeWeever says, which will now be treated as a celebration after Harris breathed new life into the party \u2013 something predicted by recent polling, as an AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll found about six in 10 Democrats believe Harris would do a good job as president.\n\nBefore Biden dropped his re-election bid, a symphony of Democrat voices called for the president to step aside following his disastrous performance during a debate with the presumptive Republican nominee, former U.S. president Donald Trump, on June 27.\n\nDeWeever called it an \"ugly moment\" for American liberals, with donors telling the president they'd close their pocket books and Hollywood's George Clooney penning a New York Times article opining Biden's inability to serve another term \u2013 but now Harris is propping the party back up.\n\n\"It is amazing to see the bounce that she has provided the Democrats in the polls \u2013 she's literally closed the gap in several key states with Donald Trump just in a week's time,\" DeWeever said.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported Friday the race between Harris and Trump is \"essentially tied\" with its latest poll seeing Trump with a two per cent lead over the current vice-president, while HarrisX/Forbes polls Trump with a three per cent lead.\n\n\"What's going to be interesting to watch out for: will there be an additional bounce at the conclusion of the Democratic Convention? If so, that would be a very, very encouraging tailwind that she'll have going forward into the final months until the election.\"\n\nTrump's next steps\n\nIt's crucial for the former president to reconsider his messaging, DeWeever said. Although Trump is leading in the polls, she notes it\u2019s still within the margin of error.\n\n\"The momentum is going in the direction of the Harris campaign and so clearly their initial instincts in terms of really harkening to racism and sexism with regards to attacks on her, isn't working,\" DeWeever said.\n\nRepublican leaders warned its party members to steer clear from these types of attacks earlier this week and urged lawmakers to stick to critiques on the Biden-Harris administration\u2019s policies. The admonitions came after some members and Trump allies called Harris \u2013 a former district attorney, attorney general and senator in California \u2013 as a \"DEI\" hire (a derisive reference to diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives).\n\nREAD MORE: Republican leaders urge colleagues to steer clear of racist and sexist attacks on Harris\n\nVice-presidential pick JD Vance might also be hindering Trump's reach with prospective voters, DeWeever adds, and called the Ohio senator a \"dud\" and an \"embarrassment.\"\n\n\"They're going to have to figure out how can they not only energize those people who would have voted for him anyway, because they have them, how can they reach out to independents? How can they maybe sway some key demographics? I know at one point they were going after Black men very aggressively \u2013 are they going to be able to do that now? Those are some things that they need to rethink and figure out,\" she said.\n\nThen there's the question of whether Trump will debate Harris on Sept. 10 \u2013 something the current vice-president accused him of \"backpedalling\" on. That said, Trump's camp says it will not commit to a Trump-Harris debate until the Democratic Party formally chooses a nominee, deeming it inappropriate to \"schedule things with Harris because Democrats very well could still change their minds.\"\n\nWith files from The Associated Press",

        "text": "A remarkable new dynamic has emerged in the US election: Kamala Harris can win\nThrough all the turmoil at the top of US politics, a remarkable new dynamic has emerged: Kamala Harris can win in November.\n\nThe moment after Donald Trump was left bloodied by a would-be assassin's bullet, the political reality changed dramatically.\n\nTrump seemed indestructible. He showed himself as the ultimate political animal \u2014 most people would be in shock and fear after someone had tried to kill them, but not Trump. He realised it made for a great political moment, raising his fist and shouting \"Fight, fight, fight!\"\n\nHis rival for the presidency at that time was Joe Biden, a frail man who was becoming increasingly enfeebled.\n\nLeading Democrats were in despair. They believed that short of something dramatic, Trump was heading back to the White House.\n\nLoading...\n\nThen it was the Democrats' turn for a dramatic twist. Key Democrats, including Nancy Pelosi and Barack Obama, made clear that Biden was not a viable candidate.\n\nBiden was fighting against that immovable reality \u2014 date of birth. DOB won.\n\nThe Democrats were tearing themselves apart as a man for whom they had great affection and respect could not bring himself to face the toughest of realities: he was too old for the job.\n\nIn the end, key Democrats' fear of a Trump redux overpowered their affection for \"Joe\".\n\nDonald Trump's choice of running mate in JD Vance doesn't broaden his appeal. (Reuters: Tom Brenner)\n\nA new race for Trump\n\nFor those few days between the assassination attempt and the Democrats' subtle leadership coup, Donald Trump was riding high. So convinced did Trump appear to be of the inevitability of a victory that he discarded conventional political wisdom and chose a running mate who in no way broadened his appeal \u2014 JD Vance.\n\nForced from the campaign, Biden quickly pivoted to endorsing his loyal deputy, Vice-President Harris.\n\nSuddenly, the race was not between two old men but between one old man \u2014 a convicted felon who almost had to be blasted from office in his previous presidential term \u2014 and a relatively young, smart professional woman at the height of her game.\n\nOvernight, Harris appealed to the Democrats' base, which re-united. Women \u2014 young women in particular \u2014 now can contemplate the possibility that they will see the first female president in US history.\n\nI went to Washington to tap into US politics, but got much more than I bargained for Photo shows Man in grey-blue suit, without tie stands in front of a camera reporting. He is outside the White House in Washington DC. An election campaign that was mostly static before the presidential debate has transformed into one of the most volatile and consequential in more than 50 years.\n\nLikewise, people from diverse backgrounds can, once again, contemplate the sentiments they had when they propelled Barack Obama into the White House, despite decades of predictions that the US would never elect a black president.\n\nEarly indications are that Harris has the ability to galvanise several key constituencies \u2014 women, young people, African Americans, minority groups and of course traditional Democrats. Certainly, serious money is now flowing into the Democrats' campaign.\n\nNone of this is to say that Harris is any certainty. Harris has not yet felt the relentless brutality of the US media as it will attempt to interview anyone the vice-president has ever lived next to, worked with or offended.\n\nLoading...\n\nHarris changes Gaza stance\n\nHarris has wasted no time differentiating herself from Biden. Within days, she has taken a much tougher position on Israel's war in Gaza.\n\nWhile insisting she supports the US's \"unshakeable\" alliance with Israel, in her recent meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Washington she did not hold back in her criticism of Israel's conduct of the war.\n\nDeclaring later that \"I will not be silent\" about the suffering of Palestinians, Harris said:\n\n\"What has happened in Gaza over the past nine months is devastating. The images of dead children and desperate hungry people fleeing for safety, sometimes displaced for the second, third or fourth time \u2014 we cannot look away in the face of these tragedies. We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering and I will not be silent.\"\n\nHarris's harder line comes as further evidence emerges of the catastrophic conditions in Gaza. The Guardian revealed that dozens of US doctors and nurses who have worked in Gaza have written to Biden and Harris to call for the US to withdraw diplomatic and military support for Israel until there is a ceasefire.\n\nWriting that in their view the death toll is already greater than 92,000, they say they cannot forget \"the scenes of unbearable cruelty directed at women and children that we witnessed ourselves\".\n\nThey write: \"Every single signatory to this letter treated children in Gaza who suffered violence that must have been deliberately directed at them. Specifically, every one of us on a daily basis treated pre-teen children who were shot in the head.\"\n\nSeveral of the signatories previously told The Guardian they believed Israeli snipers were targeting children and reported the devastating impact on civilians of weapons designed to spray high levels of shrapnel.\n\nLoading...\n\nThe Israeli army has repeatedly denied human rights abuses, saying that because Hamas embeds itself among civilians and uses them as \"human shields\" it is inevitable that some civilians will be killed.\n\nPolitically, a harder line may not be a bad thing for the Harris campaign. Much of the Jewish American vote in the US is concentrated in what are not swing states, such as Florida and New York, while Arab American voters are in several swing states, such as Michigan.\n\nUnder Biden's candidacy, many Arab American voters suggested they were not going to vote in November in protest against Biden's support for Israel in its ongoing war.\n\nA different approach by Harris may help the Democrats to hold a state such as Michigan, which has high value under the US's electoral college system.\n\nThe reality of a tough campaign\n\nWhile the result of the election is completely unpredictable, we now have a real contest.\n\n\"Kamala Harris can win, but it will be uphill,\" says Bruce Wolpe, a non-resident senior fellow at the United States Studies Centre in Sydney and author of Trump's Australia. Wolpe is also a former Democratic staffer in Washington.\n\n\"If the election were held today, Trump would win. Trump is riding high, especially since the shooting, with his supporters as enthusiastic and welded-on as ever. Trump's base is as strong as ever \u2014 especially since the assassination attempt.\n\n\"Harris has strong prospects for bringing back young voters who deserted President Biden, gaining stronger support from black voters and Latinos and winning support from women \u2014 similar to the teal voters in Australia.\n\nAs Biden pledges to 'pass the torch', his VP is sharpening her attacks on Trump Photo shows US Senator Kamala Harris smiles widely as she walks ahead of three other people. As Joe Biden starts his long goodbye with a televised address from the Oval Office, Donald Trump and his likely rival in November's presidential election, Kamala Harris, have been trading blows as a recast race for the White House begins.\n\n\"There are two core tasks for Harris. The first is taking Trump down by prosecuting and winning with independent voters the case that Trump is unfit for office and too extreme. And secondly, building up Democratic voters' enthusiasm so that Harris can come close to reprising [the victory] Biden and Harris secured in 2020. If she executes on those fronts, yes, she can win.\"\n\nWhen the euphoria among Democrats recedes, the reality of a campaign will put the blowtorch on both Harris and Trump.\n\nDemocracy is the ultimate free market. Voters are asked to buy a particular product. While Joe Biden was the candidate, Americans were being asked to buy a product that looked and behaved as faulty. The product was a year or two past its use-by date.\n\nDemocratic strategists, and much of the supportive media, were trying to argue that while the product may have been beyond its use-by date, it was still in excellent condition.\n\nThis does not mean, of course, that the majority of these groups will vote for Harris.\n\nAmerica is a very divided country, and no constituency can be taken for granted.\n\nLoading...\n\nBorder a weakness for Harris\n\nDemocrats have gone from trying to convince each other that they could support a man physically and mentally deteriorating to being asked to support an energetic, feisty woman who for four years has been sitting at the top table.\n\nThis could, of course, have its own liability. More than almost anyone she must have realised that Biden was not capable of running, let alone governing for another four years. And yet she was a cheerleader in the movement that tried to convince the public that Biden was on top of the toughest job in the world.\n\nNikki Haley provided an interesting insight in January, referring to the fact that both the major parties had elderly men as candidates. \"The first party to retire its 80-year-old candidate is going to win.\"\n\nOn Haley's logic, the Democrats are going to win.\n\nOne of Harris's possible strengths \u2014 similar to that of the new prime minister of the UK, Keir Starmer \u2014 is a background as a prosecutor. People often like the narrative of someone who \"put bad guys away\".\n\nDriving the dangerous road to Trump's border wall Photo shows Photo taken from the back seat of a car, showing a man in a cowboy hat driving a dirt road along the border wall. Where Trump's unfinished wall ends on Jim's ranch you can simply walk across the border into Mexico. It's the centre of a political battle that will shape the US presidential election.\n\nAnalyst Bruce Wolpe says Harris had \"a very rocky start\" as vice-president. \"Things [for her] were very uneven in the media, staff churn in her office, she was given the immigration portfolio and her work was seen as ineffective in asserting control over the southern border.\"\n\nIndeed, the chaotic state of the border with Mexico will probably be Harris's biggest political liability. Whether in the US or Australia, there are few more emotional issues than border security.\n\nIn Australia, John Howard tapped into this sentiment \u2014 successfully \u2014 during the 2001 election campaign with his famous declaration: \"We will decide who comes to this country and the circumstances in which they come.\"\n\nThe porousness of the border with Mexico is a major issue for Americans. Harris was designated by President Biden to fix the border and has clearly failed. Many illegal migrants continue to enter the US.\n\nAccording to a report on May 22, 2024, by the US House Committee on Homeland Security, more than 9 million illegal immigrants have entered the US since Biden became president.\n\nThe report said there had been 7.8 million \"encounters\" \u2014 the term used for illegal entries \u2014 at the south-west border with Mexico. It's important to note that the committee is controlled by Republicans, so Democrats challenge the reliability of the report.\n\nNonetheless, what is not deniable is that the US has a major problem with its southern border \u2014 which is why Trump's frequent promise to complete \"the wall\" that he began building during his first term has a resonance with many Americans.\n\nSays Bruce Wolpe: \"Immigration is Trump's number one issue and he will pummel her over it.\" However, he adds that over the past two years, Harris has had enormous recognition for her campaign for abortion rights, and is connecting with women across the US.\n\n\"She has also been outspoken on gun control,\" says Wolpe. \"Most Americans want to see progress on those two issues [women's rights and gun control]. Harris has taken to the world stage, representing the president. Harris is now performing strongly \u2014 and at the same time, she is underestimated. That is not a bad place to be politically.\"\n\nHarris's background as a prosecutor in California could be both a political positive and negative. There will be those who like a hard-nosed prosecutor, but there's another reality: many of those Harris imprisoned were African American men, and there is likely to be no shortage of men who will be keen to convince the media that Harris wrongly sent them to jail.\n\nLoading\n\nVP choice matters\n\nIn terms of Trump's vulnerabilities, one of those may be the abortion issue, or as Harris calls it, \"reproductive rights\".\n\nWhile Trump has not been as hardline as many Republicans against abortion, the man he has chosen as his running mate, JD Vance, is without question a hard-liner on the issue.\n\nTrump chose Vance when Biden was still his rival and Trump was at the height of his popularity. He'd survived an assassination attempt, had an enfeebled opponent and all the polls indicated he would win.\n\nSuddenly, that seemingly guaranteed path back to the Oval Office is in danger.\n\nTrump appeared to feel politically invincible. He therefore did not see the need to broaden his appeal and choose a running mate who would widen his net of potential supporters.\n\nHarris's choice of a running mate will be equally crucial.\n\nBut all those around Trump who urged him not to go with someone as hardline as JD Vance may prove vindicated now that the entire contest is in flux.",

In the meantime, Trump has pivoted his focus from Biden to Harris.\n\nPennsylvania, a key battleground state for this election, could accept ballots in just 50 days.

Opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado insists that opposition candidate Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez won 70% of the vote . Venezuela's deeply unpopular president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro is widely despised for leading Venezuela into its worst economic crisis in history .",
        "text": "Maduro and opposition both claim victory in Venezuela's presidential election\nMaduro and opposition both claim victory in Venezuela's presidential election\n\ntoggle caption Fernando Vergara/AP\n\nBOGOTA, Colombia \u2014 Electoral authorities claimed that Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, Venezuela\u2019s deeply unpopular president, had won a third term in Sunday\u2019s election, sparking accusations that his authoritarian regime had committed massive fraud to steal victory from opposition candidate Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez.\n\nAfter hours of delays and uncertainty, Elvis Amoroso, president of the National Electoral Council and a close Maduro ally, appeared before journalists shortly after midnight on Monday. He declared that Maduro had won with 51% compared to 44% for Gonz\u00e1lez, with 80% of the votes counted.\n\nHowever, opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado insisted that Gonz\u00e1lez, a 74-year-old retired diplomat who took Machado\u2019s place on the presidential ballot when the regime banned her from running, had won 70% of the vote compared to 30% for Maduro.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cVenezuela has a new president, and he is Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez,\u201d Machado told a crowded news conference in Caracas.\n\nAs evidence, Machado cited several exit polls and quick counts showing Gonz\u00e1lez heading toward a landslide victory, as well as paper receipts from voting machines. An exit poll published by the U.S. firm Edison Research showed Gonz\u00e1lez leading Maduro 65% to 31% while nearly all pre-election polls predicted that he would trounce Maduro.\n\n\u201cWe won in every demographic, in every state,\u201d Machado said. \u201cIt was overwhelming. We won and the whole world knows this. Even the regime knows what happened.\u201d\n\nThe National Electoral Council waited for six hours after the polls closed to announce Maduro\u2019s victory, indicating that his inner circle may have been debating how to handle the results. After his regime failed to derail the opposition campaign through dirty tricks and by banning Machado, many political analysts believed that Maduro would resort to stealing the election.\n\n\u201c100% predictable,\u201d Eric Farnsworth, vice president of the Council of the Americas think tank, said of Maduro\u2019s claim to victory.\n\nMaduro, 61, was first elected in 2013 following the death of his mentor, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, who founded Venezuela\u2019s socialist revolution in 1999. But Maduro is widely despised for leading Venezuela into its worst economic crisis in history which prompted nearly 8 million Venezuelans, about a quarter of the population, to flee the country. He has also been indicted by the U.S. for drug trafficking and terrorism while his regime is being investigated by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cI have a clean conscience,\u201d Maduro told supporters gathered at the Miraflores presidential palace. \u201cIn this new term that you have given me, I pledge that I will put my life on the line to transform Venezuela and lead us toward a prosperous future of economic growth, peace and social happiness.\u201d\n\nThe Biden administration, which has threatened to reimpose sanctions on Venezuela\u2019s vital oil industry, and other foreign governments immediately cried foul.\n\n\u201cWe have serious concerns that the result announced does not reflect the will or the votes of the Venezuelan people,\" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said. \"It's critical that every vote is counted fairly and transparently, that election officials immediately share information with the opposition and electoral observers without delay and that the electoral authorities publish detailed tabulation of votes.\"\n\nChilean President Gabriel Boric wrote on X: \u201cThe Maduro regime must understand that the results they have published are difficult to believe. Chile will not recognize any results that cannot be verified.\u201d\n\nBrazil, Colombia and other Latin American nations expressed similar concerns.\n\nAnger and frustration with Maduro was evident on Sunday, with several regime loyalists loudly booed when they showed up at polling places to vote. Confident that Gonz\u00e1lez would win, some Venezuelans chanted what has become a popular opposition slogan: \u201cIt\u2019s going to fall. It\u2019s going to fall. This regime is going to fall!\u201d\n\ntoggle caption Cristian Hernandez/AP\n\nSome Venezuelans were so eager to cast their ballots for the opposition that they lined up at polling places the night before the election. Elidio Santana, who sells bottled water on the streets of Caracas, stood in line for four hours to vote for Gonz\u00e1lez.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting for 25 years\u201d for a change of government, Santana said, adding that a few more hours wouldn\u2019t matter. \u201cWe are fed up. This country needs a change.\u201d\n\nSponsor Message\n\nOf the estimated 5.5 million voting-age Venezuelans living abroad, only about 69,000 were able to register to vote due to red tape put in place by the Maduro regime. One migrant who did manage to vote was Carolina Mart\u00ednez, a 50-year-old nurse who lives in neighboring Colombia but returned to Venezuela to cast her ballot. She predicted that a Gonz\u00e1lez victory would convince Venezuelans living abroad to repatriate.\n\n\u201cA lot of people want to come back to Venezuela and to see their homeland prosper again,\u201d said Mart\u00ednez, whose four sons also live abroad.\n\nBut with both sides claiming victory, Venezuela could face an extended period of unrest as many opposition supporters pledged to protest in the streets. Gonz\u00e1lez urged them to be peaceful as the opposition goes about gathering evidence, such as the paper receipts from voting machines, that he won the election.\n\n\u201cOur fight will continue,\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez told a news conference early Monday. \u201cWe won\u2019t stop until the will of the people is respected.\n\nCarrie Kahn contributed from Caracas.",

        "text": "Iran using covert influence campaign to undermine Trump candidacy, US intelligence says\nCNN \u2014\n\nIran is using covert social media activity and related influence operations in an effort to undercut the candidacy of former President Donald Trump, a US intelligence official said Monday in an updated assessment of threats to the November election.\n\nThe US intelligence community has \u201cobserved Tehran working to influence the presidential election, probably because Iranian leaders want to avoid an outcome they perceive would increase tensions with the United States,\u201d the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) said in a statement.\n\nThe recent Iranian influence activity has come in the form of \u201ccovert social media accounts and related activity,\u201d the official from ODNI said at a media briefing when CNN asked for examples of the activity.\n\nIran\u2019s preference for a US presidential candidate has not changed since 2020, the ODNI official said. In the 2020 election campaign, Iran \u201ccarried out a multi-pronged covert influence campaign intended to undercut former President Trump\u2019s reelection prospects,\u201d according to a declassified US intelligence report.\n\nRussia\u2019s preferences for the presidential race also haven\u2019t shifted since 2020, when Moscow conducted a range of influence operations in support of Trump and aimed at denigrating Joe Biden, the ODNI official said.\n\n\u201cIran does not engage in any objectives or activities intended to influence the U.S. election,\u201d the Iranian Permanent Mission to the United Nations said in a statement to CNN. \u201cA significant portion of such accusations are characterized by psychological operations designed to artificially pep up election campaigns.\u201d\n\nAs president, Trump ordered the killing of top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, and withdrew from a multilateral deal aimed at curbing Tehran\u2019s nuclear program. Iran has vowed revenge for Soleimani\u2019s death.\n\nThe alleged Iranian threats to the Trump candidacy have not just been online.\n\nUS authorities obtained intelligence from a human source in recent weeks on a plot by Iran to try to assassinate Trump, a development that led to the Secret Service increasing security around the former president, CNN first reported on July 16. There\u2019s no indication that Thomas Matthew Crooks, the would-be assassin who attempted to kill the former president at a rally in Pennsylvania on July 13, was connected to the Iranian plot.\n\nIran has denied the assassination plot allegations.\n\nForeign influence actors have used the attempted assassination of Trump \u201cas part of their narratives, portraying the event to fit their broader goals,\u201d the ODNI official said without offering examples.\n\nIran is also attempting to covertly stoke protests in the US related to the Israel-Hamas conflict by posing as activists online and in some cases providing financial support to protesters, US Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines said this month.\n\n\u201cTehran relies on vast webs of online personas and propaganda mills to spread disinformation and have notably been active in exacerbating tensions over the Israel-Gaza conflict,\u201d the ODNI said in its statement on Monday.\n\nRussia is the \u2018predominant threat\u2019 to US elections\n\nThe updated intelligence assessment covers a range of covert and overt influence activity, showing that the number of foreign actors targeting US elections has continued to grow since the Kremlin\u2019s sweeping effort to influence the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cRussia remains the predominant threat to U.S. elections,\u201d ODNI said in its assessment on Monday. Moscow is using Russia-based \u201cinfluence-for-hire\u201d firms that are getting better at tailoring content to American audiences, US officials said.\n\nCNN has requested comment from the Russian Embassy in Washington, DC. The Russian government regularly denies US allegations of election influence.\n\nChina \u201cprobably does not plan to influence the outcome\u201d of the US presidential election, but US intelligence is monitoring the possibility that China-linked propagandists and influence actors could \u201cdenigrate down-ballot candidates,\u201d the updated assessment says.\n\nChinese leader Xi Jinping told Biden that China would not interfere in the 2024 US presidential election when the two men met in November, CNN previously reported.",

This will truly be the golden age of America.\u201d\n\nTrump is now just the second defeated president in history to win a nonconsecutive term.

She became the Democratic Party\u2019s nominee this summer, not long after Biden\u2019s unprecedented exit from the race. Biden bowed out in July, a few weeks after a disastrous debate performance that had Democratic allies calling for him to step aside and \u201cpass the torch\u201d for the good of the party and the country.\n\nTrump\u2019s victory comes in the same year that he was convicted of a felony and escaped two attempts on his life. In July, eight days before Biden dropped out, Trump was shot in the ear during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nAs the election draws to a close, we look back at the extraordinary events that have shaped this race.",

        "text": "July 29, 2024, presidential campaign news\nFar from the boring rematch that had many Americans tuning out politics, the 2024 presidential election has had wild twists and scary turns.\n\nNobody expected President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign to implode in less than a month, from the shock of his performance at CNN\u2019s debate in late June to his decision to step aside in the race in late July. Democrats went from literally freaking out about his candidacy to a new excitement about Vice President Kamala Harris as his replacement.\n\nNobody expected an assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump, an event that unified Republicans around him and has many in his party showing a sort of divine reverence for his near-death experience.\n\nSo we don\u2019t know specifically what will happen in the sprint to Election Day on November 5, or what could come after, when the country\u2019s unique Electoral College process gets going. But we do have some idea of what to expect:\n\nAugust: Nominating Harris, picking a VP and a convention in Chicago: While the Democratic Party almost immediately rallied around Harris as its nominee, it still needs to officially select her. Delegates will do that in short order, between August 1 and August 7, before the convention, a backstop maneuver to ward against ballot changes.\n\nHarris will also need to pick a running mate. Look for that to occur soon, according to CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny, and not right before the convention, as frequently occurs.\n\nIn late August, Democrats will convene in Chicago for their convention. Expect the most incredible reception for Biden. Democrats have pivoted from worrying over his election prospects to lionizing him as a hero.\n\nEarlier in the month, Sen. JD Vance, Trump\u2019s running mate, turns 40. He\u2019d be the third-youngest vice president in US history and the first millennial in nationwide elected office if the Republican ticket wins. With Biden out of the race, Vance is on the ticket with the oldest major-party nominee in history with Trump, a baby boomer.\n\nRead more about what to expect with the presidential election less than 100 days away.",

Since then, Vice-President Kamala Harris is all set to receive a presidential nomination from the Democratic Party. She has attracted the support of many delegates, received more than $250 million in donations and been endorsed by many of the top law makers including Joe Biden himself.While she has managed to gain the support from her party members, how does she perform against Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump ? The results of three major aggregate polls have been published. The results are indicative of a shifting political narrative in the US. It shows a close competition between Harris and Trump.There is barely 100 days left for the presidential election and the results published by the New York Times, The Hill and Real Clear Politics have all given Trump, a marginal lead over Biden.Among the three polls, Real Clear Politics shows the smallest gap between the two candidates. Trump received the support of 47.9% of the respondents and Harris received the support of 46.2% of the respondents. Trump had a 1.7% lead over Harris.The New York Times gave Trump a lead over Harris by just 2 points. While 48% of the respondents supported Trump, 46% of the supporters supported Harris.Finally, The Hill showed that Trump garnered the support of 48% of the electorate in comparison to Harris who received the support of 45.9% of the respondents, indicating a lead of just 2.1%.In the same surveys, before his exit, Trump had a greater lead over the incumbent president. It is these surveys that led to Biden\u2019s exit. The Real Clear Politics showed that Biden was trailing behind Trump by 3.1%.In the New York Times, Trump had a lead of an additional one percentage point over Biden. He had a lead of 3% over Biden. The survey by The Hill showed Trump leading by 3.3% against Biden.One of the surveys with the largest sample size of 11,297 registered voters, conducted by the Morning Consult found that Trump had 1% lead over Harris and this increased to 2% in the Reuters/Ipsos poll survey. Most of these surveys have a margin of error of at least 1-2%. This shows that the results of the upcoming presidential election may be too close to call.A candidate can win the popular vote but still lose the electoral college vote. Most recently, this has happened in 2016 when Hilary Clinton lost to Donald Trump. In 2000 too, this happened and it happened three times in the 19century.The US President is elected indirectly by the Electoral College. The people vote for the candidate of their choice in both the presidential and the vice-presidential elections. However, the electoral college consisting of representatives from the states meet in December and decide the fate of these candidates.",

        "text": "Can Trump Vote Now That He Has Felony Convictions?\nAfter Donald Trump became the first former president to be convicted of a crime, many believed that the Florida resident would be barred from voting in the 2024 election because of the state\u2019s harsh felony disenfranchisement law, which denies voting rights to more than 1 million people. However, Trump\u2019s eligibility to cast a ballot this fall will depend on how he is sentenced in New York for falsifying business records.\n\nHis ability to vote in Florida could also be affected by the prosecutions against him in Georgia state court and federal courts in Florida and Washington, DC, although those trials are unlikely to happen before the election.\n\nCan Trump vote in the 2024 election?\n\nYes, unless he is incarcerated for his felonies in New York at the time of the election or convicted of a felony in another jurisdiction that takes away his right to vote in that jurisdiction. Trump is a Florida resident, and Florida law says that a person convicted in another state can vote in Florida if they are allowed to vote in that other state. Since he was convicted in a New York state court, his eligibility to vote in Florida is governed by New York\u2019s law, which allows everyone who\u2019s not currently serving a sentence in prison to vote.\n\nAccording to the Florida Division of Elections, \u201ca felony conviction in another state makes a person ineligible to vote in Florida only if the conviction would make the person ineligible to vote in the state where the person was convicted.\u201d\n\nTrump has been convicted of felonies in New York and under New York state law, so New York law will determine his eligibility to vote in Florida. Under New York law, a person convicted of a felony is disenfranchised only while incarcerated for that felony. Thus, Trump will be able to vote as long as he is not incarcerated for his New York felonies at the time of the election.\n\nIf Trump can vote so long as he\u2019s not in prison, why are so many other Floridians with past convictions who are living in the community disenfranchised?\n\nFlorida treats residents convicted of a felony in the state differently than residents convicted of a felony out of state. Under Florida law, people convicted of a felony other than murder or a felony sexual offense in a Florida state or federal court are disenfranchised during any term of incarceration, probation, parole, or other forms of community supervision and until they have paid off any fines, fees, court costs, and restitution ordered by the court at the time of sentencing. Therefore, had Trump been convicted in Florida, he would have been barred from voting unless he had completed all the terms of his sentence \u2014 including payment of any related court debts \u2014 or had his voting rights restored by the state\u2019s clemency board.\n\nThe Brennan Center supports the right to vote for everyone who\u2019s living in the community, and that includes Trump. The fact that he likely will be able to vote \u2014 while the more than 1 million Floridians living in the community will be denied that right simply because they were convicted in Florida \u2014 demonstrates the injustice in the state\u2019s approach.\n\nAdditionally, the difficulty of determining Trump\u2019s voter eligibility shows how complicated it can be for any Florida resident to understand their own. This confusing system underscores the unfairness of the state\u2019s prosecutions of dozens of people who were confused or misled about their eligibility to vote.\n\nWould Trump be eligible to vote in the fall if he\u2019s convicted of a felony in Georgia or federal court?\n\nIt depends on which case results in a conviction, although a completed trial in any of them before the election is highly unlikely. Trump has two active prosecutions related to his role in the attempt to overturn the 2020 election: one in federal court in Washington and the other in Georgia state court. His prosecution in Florida federal court for his alleged mishandling of classified documents was dismissed by Judge Aileen Cannon on July 15.\n\nIf Trump were found guilty of another felony in the DC federal court case, his voting eligibility would be unaffected because people convicted of a felony in DC do not lose the right to vote.\n\nA Georgia state felony conviction, by contrast, would likely disenfranchise Trump unless he was pardoned by the state\u2019s governor or had his voting rights restored by Florida\u2019s clemency board. Georgia law establishes that people convicted of a felony cannot vote during any period of incarceration, probation, or parole and unless they\u2019ve fully paid any fines for that felony.\n\nA federal conviction in Florida would likely disenfranchise Trump as well unless he was pardoned by the president or had his voting rights restored by the state\u2019s clemency board, as people convicted of a felony other than murder or a felony sex offense in Florida are barred from voting during any period of incarceration, probation, or community control and unless they\u2019ve fully paid any fines, fees, court costs, and restitution ordered by the court at the time of sentencing.\n\nCould Florida\u2019s clemency board intervene if Trump does become ineligible to vote?\n\nAfter the news of Trump\u2019s conviction, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said that the Florida Clemency Board, which is made up of DeSantis and the three members of his cabinet, would step in to restore the former president\u2019s voting rights if needed. The clemency board could probably follow through on that promise.\n\nIf Trump were in prison for his New York convictions at the time of the election (which appears unlikely), he would not be eligible to vote in Florida unless the clemency board restored his voting rights. The Rules of Executive Clemency require people with out-of-state or federal convictions to complete all nonfinancial terms of their sentence, including any term of incarceration or supervision, before they can apply to have their rights restored. The rules also limit restoration to those who do not have pending criminal charges. Thus, if Trump were incarcerated at the time of the election for his New York felonies or any of his prosecutions were active, he would not be eligible to apply to have his voting rights restored.\n\nThat said, the clemency board has broad authority to restore civil rights under Florida law to people with out-of-state or federal felonies. Its rules give the governor \u201cunfettered discretion to require at any time that an individual matter be treated under other provisions of these rules, whether or not the person satisfies the eligibility requirements of a particular rule.\u201d So DeSantis could bend the rules to allow Trump to apply even if he otherwise would not be eligible to do so. Trump\u2019s application would then have to be approved by DeSantis and at least two other members of the clemency board.\n\nAre all states\u2019 rules for voting after a felony conviction as confusing as Florida\u2019s?\n\nNo. However, the variation between states causes immense confusion among voters and election officials alike. Maine, Vermont, and Washington, DC, have the simplest rules because they never take the right to vote away, followed by the 23 states that disenfranchise people convicted of felonies only while they are incarcerated. In the remaining 25 states, people can remain disenfranchised after release from prison, and their eligibility to vote can depend on a number of factors, such as the type of offense or the type of fines or fees that they owe.",

        "text": "How Presidential Polling Got Its Start\nThe first U.S. presidential poll to use modern statistical methods was a Gallup poll in 1936. But the first known presidential straw polls date to 1824\u2014over a century before.\n\nThese early straw polls were regional and informal. Newspapers reported the results as information about local opinions rather than possible predictions about how the national election might play out.\n\nLocal straw polls continued throughout the 19th century. Then in 1916, The Literary Digest launched a national presidential poll. The magazine\u2019s methods were flawed, but for five consecutive presidential races, the winner of The Literary Digest poll was also the winner of the actual election.\n\nThis streak ended in 1936, when George Gallup predicted Franklin D. Roosevelt would win reelection and The Literary Digest said he wouldn\u2019t. Gallup\u2019s poll was a victory for statistical survey methods, and paved the way for modern presidential polling.\n\nPresidential Election Facts\n\nThe 1824 Election\n\nThe 1824 presidential election was unique in many ways. The caucus system that U.S. politicians had thus far used to nominate candidates had fallen out of favor, and politicians struggled to adopt a new nomination process (the national party convention didn\u2019t debut until 1831). The country\u2019s first party system had also fallen apart, so the only candidates to choose from were Democratic-Republicans\u2014and there were four of them running at the same time in the general election.\n\nIn this chaotic situation, white male voters began to take straw polls to see who others were voting for. They took these polls at all types of gatherings: militia assemblies, grand juries, Fourth of July celebrations and elections for other offices. We know about these polls because newspapers reported on their results. In contrast to today, newspapers didn\u2019t frame these results as predictive of the national election.\n\n\u201cI think people took this as interesting and informative, but not in any sense definitive,\u201d says Tom W. Smith, director of NORC\u2019s Center for the Study of Politics & Society, who has written about the 1824 straw polls for The Public Opinion Quarterly.\n\nIt would\u2019ve been hard for any poll to predict what happened in the 1824 election, anyway. Andrew Jackson won the most popular and electoral votes; but because he didn\u2019t win the majority of electoral votes, the U.S. Constitution dictated that the U.S. House of Representatives choose the president. The House elected John Quincy Adams, who had come in second in the popular and electoral votes (the other runners-up were William H. Crawford and Henry Clay).\n\nAlthough newspapers reported on the 1824 straw polls, it doesn\u2019t appear that they organized any themselves. As the 19th century progressed, newspapers began conducting their own polls, both as self-promotion and a way of gathering information for readers. Still, these straw polls remained regional, and news publications don\u2019t seem to have framed their polls as electoral predictions.\n\nThis changed in the early 20th century, when The Literary Digest introduced a national presidential poll that gained a reputation for correctly naming the electoral victor.\n\nGeorge Gallup Founds Polling Institute\n\nSTF/AFP via Getty Images Public-opinion statistician George Horace Gallup (center) in a September 1945 photo. In 1935, Gallup founded an institute for public-opinion poll.\n\nIn 1916, The Literary Digest conducted a national straw poll about the presidential election. The poll favored incumbent president Woodrow Wilson, who won reelection later that year. Four years later, the weekly magazine sent out postcards for another national presidential poll. Once again, the winner of The Literary Digest poll\u2014Warren G. Harding\u2014also won the real election.\n\nThe Literary Digest\u2019s predictive streak continued for three more elections, as its polls correctly anticipated the presidential victories of Calvin Coolidge in 1924, Herbert Hoover in 1928 and Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1932. The polls gained the magazine a lot of attention, including from a man named George Gallup.\n\nGallup got his start in public opinion polling while working at an advertising firm. In 1932, he conducted a poll to see if his mother-in-law, Ola Babcock Miller, had a chance of becoming Iowa\u2019s first female secretary of state, and it correctly predicted she\u2019d win. A few years later, he founded the American Institute of Public Opinion, which later became the Gallup organization.\n\nIn 1936, Gallup publicly challenged The Literary Digest\u2019s polling methods in a bid to promote his own. He conducted a presidential survey predicting FDR would win reelection, which clashed with The Literary Digest\u2019s poll predicting Kansas Governor Alf Landon would beat him. The public challenge paid off when FDR won the election in a landslide. The victory helped promote Gallup\u2019s methods while discrediting those of The Literary Digest, which folded a couple of years later.\n\nGallup\u2019s organization continued to conduct polls on public opinion and presidential preferences, running into some issues along the way. One of the most infamous hiccups was in 1948, when Gallup\u2019s company\u2014along with other polling firms\u2014predicted that New York Governor Thomas E. Dewey would beat incumbent president Harry S. Truman.\n\nWith the polls in agreement, the Chicago Daily Tribune felt confident settling on \u201cDewey Defeats Truman\u201d for the early morning headline the day after the election, leading to the famous photo of a victorious Truman holding up the erroneous newspaper headline.\n\nDespite similar \u201csurprise\u201d victories over the years, presidential polls have continued to be a major part of election news, and also become a tool political parties use to test the strength of their own candidates.",

(Brendan Smialowski/Pool/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nHow we did this Pew Research Center conducted this study to understand Americans\u2019 attitudes toward the war in Ukraine. For this analysis, we surveyed 9,424 adults from July 1-7, 2024. Everyone who took part in this survey is a member of the Center\u2019s American Trends Panel (ATP), a group of people recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses who have agreed to take surveys regularly. This kind of recruitment gives nearly all U.S. adults a chance of selection. Surveys were conducted either online or by telephone with a live interviewer. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other factors. Read more about the ATP\u2019s methodology. Here are the questions used for this report, the topline and the survey methodology.\n\nWith the conflict in Ukraine now in its third year, Republicans and Democrats continue to differ over U.S. policy toward the war-torn country.\n\nA 62% majority of Republicans say the United States does not have a responsibility to help Ukraine defend itself from Russia\u2019s invasion.\n\nAmericans overall are evenly divided on whether the U.S. has a responsibility to help Ukraine (48% say it does, 49% say it does not).\n\nAbout two-thirds of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (63%) say the U.S. has this responsibility.\n\nOnly about a third of Republicans and Republican leaners (36%) say the same.\n\nAmericans remain divided on levels of U.S. aid to Ukraine. Today, 29% of Americans say the U.S. is providing too much support to Ukraine, and a similar share say it\u2019s providing about the right amount (26%). About two-in-ten (19%) say the U.S. is not providing enough support, while a quarter are not sure.\n\nDemocrats largely say the U.S. is providing either the right amount of aid (36%) or not enough assistance (27%). Just 13% say the U.S. is sending too much aid to Ukraine.\n\nNearly half of Republicans (47%) say the U.S. is providing too much aid to Ukraine, more than three times the share of Democrats who say this. Only 18% say current aid levels are about right, while just 12% say the U.S. is providing too little aid.\n\nThe new Pew Research Center survey of 9,424 U.S. adults was conducted July 1-7, 2024 \u2013 before President Joe Biden announced he was dropping his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nRelated: Joe Biden, Public Opinion and His Withdrawal From the 2024 Race\n\nHow much of a threat does the war in Ukraine pose to U.S. interests?\n\nThe share of Americans saying Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine is a threat to U.S. interests has declined significantly since 2022. Today, about a third of the public (34%) says Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine poses a \u201cmajor threat\u201d to U.S. interests. Shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine, half said it was a major threat.\n\nThere is a wide and growing gap between Republicans and Democrats over whether the war in Ukraine is a major threat to U.S. interests.\n\nBoth Democrats and Republicans are less likely to say the conflict is a major threat to the U.S. than they were in its early days. But that decline is far sharper among Republicans.\n\n45% of Democrats now say Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine is a major threat, 5 percentage points lower than in March of 2022 but 7 points higher than a year ago.\n\n26% of Republicans say the war is a major threat to the U.S. This share has been essentially flat since early 2023 and remains well below the 51% of Republicans who said this early in the war.\n\nViews of U.S. policies toward Ukraine: Sanctions, military aid, strikes on targets in Russia\n\nA greater share of Americans approve of keeping strict economic sanctions on Russia (69%) than approve of continuing to send military equipment to Ukraine (54%) or allowing Ukraine to use U.S. weapons to strike targets inside Russia (54%).\n\nMajorities of both Republicans (66%) and Democrats (77%) approve of keeping strict economic sanctions on Russia.\n\nMuch smaller shares of Republicans approve of continuing to provide military equipment and weaponry to Ukraine (42%) or allowing Ukraine to use U.S.-made weapons inside Russia\u2019s borders (46%).\n\nMost Democrats approve of continuing to send military aid to Ukraine (71%) and allowing Ukraine to use American-made weapons to strike targets in Russia (65%).\n\nViews of U.S. aid to Ukraine\n\nAmericans continue to be divided over the amount of aid the U.S. is providing to support Ukraine against Russia.\n\nOver the past year and a half, the leading view among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents has been that the U.S. is providing too much support to Ukraine (47% say this currently).\n\nThis balance of opinion among Republicans has not changed much over this period, and it represents a reversal from early in the conflict when fewer than a quarter of Republicans said the U.S. was providing too much aid.\n\nMost Democrats and Democratic leaners have consistently said the U.S. is providing either too little or about the right amount of aid since the war began.\n\nThe share of Democrats who said the U.S. was sending too little aid increased in April, before a new $95 billion aid bill passed Congress. It has now returned to about where it was in late 2023. Only 13% of Democrats say the U.S. is providing too much aid to Ukraine.\n\nAssessments of Ukraine\u2019s military efforts and concerns about the war\n\nAmericans have mixed views of Ukraine\u2019s military effort. Only 11% say Ukraine\u2019s efforts to defend itself are going extremely or very well. More than twice as many (26%) say they are going not too well or not at all well. About four-in-ten (42%) say they\u2019re going somewhat well.\n\nRepublicans are slightly more pessimistic about Ukraine\u2019s defense than Democrats. About a third of Republicans (32%) say Ukraine\u2019s military efforts are not going well, compared with 21% of Democrats.\n\nNearly half of Democrats (47%) say Ukraine\u2019s defense is going somewhat well. About four-in-ten Republicans (39%) say the same.\n\nConcerns over the war in Ukraine\n\nAmericans express a range of concerns arising from the Russia-Ukraine war:\n\n51% say they are extremely or very concerned that the war will continue for many years.\n\nA nearly identical share (50%) are extremely or very concerned that Russia will invade other countries in the region.\n\nSomewhat smaller shares are at least very concerned about Ukraine being defeated by Russia (43% are extremely or very concerned) and U.S. and NATO support for Ukraine leading to a war with Russia (41%).\n\nRelated: NATO Seen Favorably in Member States; Confidence in Zelenskyy Down in Europe, U.S.\n\nDemocrats are significantly more likely than Republicans to say they are highly concerned about Russia invading other countries in Europe and that Ukraine will lose and be taken over.\n\nSix-in-ten Democrats say they are extremely or very concerned that Russia will invade other countries in the region. Roughly four-in-ten Republicans (42%) are as concerned about this.\n\nA majority of Democrats (56%) say they are extremely or very concerned about Ukraine being defeated and taken over by Russia, compared with 33% of Republicans. Democrats\u2019 concerns about Ukraine losing have increased modestly since 2022.\n\nRepublicans (45%) express somewhat higher levels of concern than Democrats (38%) that U.S. and NATO support for Ukraine will lead to a direct war between the U.S. and Russia. Concern among members of both political coalitions is somewhat higher than it was two years ago.",

        "text": "Two of Maine\u2019s congressional races will use ranked-choice voting in November \u2022 Maine Morning Star\nTwo of the three congressional races on Maine ballots in November will use ranked-choice voting, which has impacted the outcome of some recent elections.\n\nLast week, the Department of the Secretary of State released an updated list of general candidates for all races, except for the presidency. The list included an independent candidate running for Maine\u2019s 1st Congressional District, currently held by U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree. It also confirmed there are three candidates running against independent Angus King for his U.S. Senate seat. Because those races have more than two candidates each, they will use ranked-choice voting.\n\nKing is being challenged by Republican Demi Kouzounas, Democrat David Costello and independent Jason Cherry. The former Maine governor easily won his first campaign for the U.S. Senate in 2012 and had little trouble getting reelected in 2018.\n\nJune\u2019s Republican primary for the 1st Congressional District determined Ron Russell would challenge incumbent Pingree, a Democrat. The updated list from the Secretary of State includes a third candidate, Ethan Alcorn, an unenrolled independent from Saco.\n\nAlcorn describes himself as a nonpartisan candidate, \u201cwith very simple and straightforward views to fix straightforward problems.\u201d He added that he\u2019s not left or right, but seeks \u201ccommon sense and practical solutions.\u201d\n\nHaving had multiple careers throughout his life, first as a massage therapist, then as a translator for a nonprofit and then landscaping, Alcorn became more politically involved after the 2016 election by contributing on talk radio stations WLOB and WGAN.\n\nAlcorn tried to run for governor in 2018, but said he lacked the skills at the time to run a successful signature campaign. He tried again in 2022, but was short 600 signatures to get on the ballot, which he said was \u201cdue to time constraints.\u201d Between those runs, Alcorn ran for school board in Saco and lost by 68 votes.\n\nBecause there are only two candidates, Republican Austin Theriault and incumbent Democrat Jared Golden, vying for Maine\u2019s 2nd Congressional District, ranked-choice voting will not be a factor.\n\nRanked-choice voting could potentially be used in the presidential election if independent Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. \u2014 who has to submit 4,000 signatures to the Maine Secretary of State by Thursday \u2014 is on the ballot.\n\nHow it works\n\nUnder ranked-choice voting, voters indicate which candidate is their first choice, second choice, and so on. If no candidate receives more than 50% of the votes on election night, the candidate with the least votes is eliminated and their votes get reassigned to whomever their voters ranked second. This process is repeated until one candidate wins a majority of votes.\n\nRanked-choice voting has twice come into play in Maine\u2019s 2nd Congressional District. Both in 2018 and 2022, Golden beat former U.S. Rep. Bruce Poliquin after ranked-choice run offs.\n\nMaine was the first state to adopt ranked-choice voting when it did so back in 2016, but it has gained popularity in recent years as more states and municipalities have adopted the practice.",

        "text": "Historian who correctly predicted 9 out of last 10 presidential elections gives his take on Harris vs. Trump\nPresidential election prognosticator Allan Lichtman has correctly predicted the winners in nine out of the last 10 presidential elections.\n\nAnd on Friday, the historian gave his take in the race between Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris and former GOP President Donald Trump.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not good news for the Republicans, USA Today reported.\n\nWhile he hasn\u2019t made a final prediction yet, Lichtman told News Nation that \u201ca lot would have to go wrong for Harris to lose.\u201d\n\nLichtman uses a formula know as \u201c13 Keys to the White House,\u201d which he developed in 1981 along with mathematician Vladimir Keilis-Borok.\n\nLichtman uses those 13 criteria to analyze the party that holds the White House\u2019s chances of keeping that control in an election year.\n\nIf the White House party is considered successful in eight or more of the \u201ckeys,\u201d then the incumbent party is expected to win. If the incumbent party is viewed as a failure in six or more of the criteria the challenger is expected to win, according to USA Today.\n\nLichtman said that the eight keys favoring the Democrats in 2024 include no primary challenger for the incumbent; no third-party challenge (with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. not thought to have enough strength to affect the outcome); a strong short-term economy; a strong long-term economy; major policy change from the previous (Trump) administration; no social unrest; no scandal, and an uncharismatic challenger who does not appeal across party lines.\n\nLichtman has used the system to correctly predict the winner of each presidential election from 1984 to 2012, missing out only in 2000, when he predicted Democrat Al Gore would defeat Republican George W. Bush.\n\nLichtman called the 2016 election correctly for Trump even though the keys referred only to the popular vote, which Trump lost. Lichtman correctly predicted Joe Biden\u2019s victory in 2020. The model now predicts the Electoral College winner.\n\nLichtman will make his final call on the race in August, after the Democratic National Convention in Chicago.",

Following this omission, Donald Trump Jr. and Republicans accused the Sundar Pichai-led tech company of \u201cintentionally\u201d meddling with elections.\n\nIn a post on X (formerly Twitter), Trump Jr. wrote, \u201cBig Tech is trying to interfere in the election AGAIN to help Kamala Harris.

Google's spokesperson explained that their systems have safeguards to prevent autocomplete suggestions related to political violence, the report said.\n\nHowever, users noted that this policy didn't seem to apply when searching for assassination attempts on other politicians, such as John F. Kennedy, Abraham Lincoln, Ronald Reagan, and Teddy Roosevelt.\n\nAlso Read | Trump assassination bid: US Secret Service director Kimberly Cheatle resigns",

        "text": "How Harris and Trump differ on artificial intelligence policy\nTwo days after President Joe Biden signed a sweeping executive order on artificial intelligence last year, Vice President Kamala Harris brought the wonky document to a global AI summit, telling an international audience what set the U.S. apart in its approach to AI safety.\n\nIn an event meant to address the potential catastrophes posed by futuristic forms of AI, Harris made waves by pivoting to present-day concerns \u2014 and the need to codify protections quickly without stifling innovation.\n\n\"When a senior is kicked off his healthcare plan because of a faulty AI algorithm, is that not existential for him?\" Harris told a crowd in London last November. \"When a woman is threatened by an abusive partner with explicit deepfake photographs, is that not existential for her?\"\n\nNow, she's running for president and her chief opponent, former President Donald Trump, has said he wants to \"cancel\" the Biden order. Trump's running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, also brings his own views on AI, which are influenced by his ties to some Silicon Valley figures pushing to limit AI regulation.\n\nAI's growing visibility in everyday life has made it a popular discussion topic but hasn't yet elevated it to a top concern for American voters. But this could be the first presidential election where the candidates are crafting competing visions on how to guide American leadership over the fast-developing technology.\n\nHere are the candidates' records on AI:\n\nTrump's approach\n\nBiden signed his AI executive order last Oct. 30, and soon after Trump was signaling on the campaign trail that, if re-elected, he'd do away with it. His pledge was memorialized in the platform of this month's Republican National Convention.\n\n\"We will repeal Joe Biden's dangerous Executive Order that hinders AI Innovation, and imposes Radical Leftwing ideas on the development of this technology,\" says Trump's platform. \"In its place, Republicans support AI Development rooted in Free Speech and Human Flourishing.\"\n\nThe Trump campaign didn't respond to a requests for more details.\n\nTrump didn't spend much time talking about AI during his four years as president, though in 2019 he became the first to sign an executive order about AI. It directed federal agencies to prioritize research and development in the field.\n\nBefore that, tech experts were pushing the Trump-era White House for a stronger AI strategy to match what other countries were pursuing. In 2017, not long before Google quietly introduced a research breakthrough helping to set the foundation of the technology now known as generative AI, then-Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin brushed aside concerns about AI displacing jobs, saying that prospect was so far in the future that \"it's not even on my radar screen.\"\n\nThat perspective later shifted, with Trump's top tech adviser telling corporate leaders in 2018 that AI-fueled job displacement is \"inevitable\" and that \"we can't sit idle, hoping eventually the market will sort it out.\" The 2019 order called on federal agencies to \"protect civil liberties, privacy and American values\" in applying AI technologies, and to help workers gain relevant skills.\n\nTrump also in the waning weeks of his administration signed an executive order promoting the use of \"trustworthy\" AI in the federal government. Those policies carried over into the Biden administration.\n\nHarris' approach\n\nThe debut of ChatGPT nearly halfway through Biden's presidential term made it impossible for politicians to ignore AI. Within months, Harris was convening the heads of Google, Microsoft and other tech companies at the White House, a first step down a path that brought leading developers to agree to voluntary commitments to ensure their technology won't put people's rights and safety at risk.\n\nThen came Biden's AI order, which used Korean War-era national security powers to scrutinize high-risk commercial AI systems but was mostly directed at safeguarding the government's use of the technology and setting standards that could foster commercial adoption. Unlike the European Union, however, the U.S. still has no broad rules on AI \u2014 something that would require Congress to pass.\n\nHarris already brought to the White House a deep understanding of Silicon Valley, having grown up and worked in the San Francisco Bay Area and later served as California's attorney general, where she forged relationships with some tech leaders, said Alondra Nelson, former director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.\n\nEven before ChatGPT, Nelson led the White House efforts to draft a blueprint for an AI \"bill of rights\" to guard against the technology's potential harms. But it was the speech at the Global Summit on AI Safety in London where Harris brought all those threads together and \"articulated to the world what American AI strategy was,\" Nelson said.\n\nHarris said she and Biden \"reject the false choice that suggests we can either protect the public or advance innovation.\" And while acknowledging a need to consider existential threats to humanity, Harris emphasized \"the full spectrum of AI risk.\"\n\n\"She kind of opened the aperture of the conversation about potential AI risks and harms,\" Nelson said.\n\nVance and the VCs\n\nTrump's pick of the former venture capitalist Vance as running mate added a new element to the differences between the campaigns. So did Trump's newfound endorsements from a group of AI-focused tech leaders including Elon Musk and the venture capitalists Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz.\n\nVance has acknowledged some harmful AI applications, but said at a July Senate hearing that he worries that concern is justifying \"some preemptive overregulation attempts that would frankly entrench the tech incumbents that we already have.\"\n\nAndreessen, who sits on the board of Meta Platforms, has criticized a provision of Biden's order that requires government scrutiny of the most powerful and ostensibly risky AI systems if they can perform a certain number of mathematical calculations per second.\n\nOn a podcast with business partner Horowitz explaining their support of Trump, Andreessen said he was concerned with \"the idea that we're going to deliberately hamstring ourselves through onerous regulations while the rest of the world lights up on this, and while China lights up on this.\"\n\nHorowitz read aloud the RNC call to repeal Biden's order, saying \"that sounds like a good plan to me\" and noting that he and Andreessen had discussed the proposals with Trump at a dinner.\n\nTrump met with another group of VCs in a video podcast in June, sharing their view that AI leadership will require huge amounts of electricity \u2014 a perspective he shared again on the RNC stage where he said it will require \"twice the electricity that's available now in our country.\" It was his sole mention of AI in the 92-minute speech.\n\nAre they that different on AI?\n\nMuch is still unknown, including to what extent either Harris or the Trump-Vance ticket will heed the opinions of their competing wings of Silicon Valley support.\n\nWhile the rhetorical differences are sharpening, \"there's a lot of similarity\" between how the Trump and Biden administrations approached AI policy, said Aaron Cooper, senior vice president of global policy for BSA The Software Alliance, which advocates for software companies including Microsoft.\n\nVoters haven't yet heard much detail about how a Harris or second Trump administration would change that.\n\n\"What we'll continue to see as the technology develops and as new issues arise, regardless of who's in the White House, they'll be looking at how we can unleash the most good from AI while reducing the most harm,\" Cooper said. \"That sounds obvious, but it's not an easy calculation.\"",

        "text": "Could Palestine decide the US presidential election?\nIt has been a dramatic half a month for US politics with a dizzying string of rapid-fire events. Republican candidate and former president, Donald Trump, survived an assassination attempt and emerged bolder and more energised in rallying his base. President Joe Biden withdrew from the presidential race, endorsing his vice president, Kamala Harris, who within a week managed to win enough delegate support to secure the nomination at the upcoming Democratic National Convention set for August 19-22.\n\nHarris has re-invigorated the Democratic campaign, raising more than $200m in donations, getting 100,000 new voters to register, and securing 170,000 new volunteers within just seven days.\n\nShe is also doing better at the polls. Her \u201cfavourability\u201d score with the American public rose 8 percentage points to 43 percent in one week. Among likely voters, she is currently polling at 47 percent, just one percentage point behind Trump.\n\nSome of Harris\u2019s early success may be attributed to the significant relief many Democrats certainly felt over Biden\u2019s decision to step aside. A whopping 87 percent of registered Democrats supported his withdrawal.\n\nBut this early momentum is unlikely to hold all the way to the election in early November. And while Harris brought much-needed change to the Democratic campaign, she also represents continuity with the Biden administration, which on certain issues could put her at a disadvantage.\n\nOne of these issues is the Israeli genocide in Gaza. Let us remember that one reason Biden was initially seen to be vulnerable was the Arab and Muslim American-led \u201cuncommitted vote\u201d campaign during the Democratic primaries earlier this year. A significant percentage of Democrats voted uncommitted to signal their rejection of Biden\u2019s unconditional support for Israel\u2019s Gaza genocide.\n\nThe results in key swing states particularly worried the Biden campaign. In Michigan and Wisconsin, for example, 101,000 and 47,800, respectively, voted uncommitted. Biden had won both states by margins as small as 154,000 and 20,600 in 2020.\n\nIn the latest polls, Harris is trailing Trump by 2 to 10 percent in swing states like Georgia, Arizona, Nevada and Pennsylvania; in Michigan, she is one percentage point behind and in Wisconsin they both poll at 47 percent. In other words, the Arab and Muslim American communities, supported by their many progressive allies, could play a defining role in determining small-margin wins in these states. They may prove key for her victory, if she lags behind Trump in other swing states like Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina or Georgia.\n\nMembers of the \u201cAbandon Biden\u201d and \u201cuncommitted\u201d movements have threatened to abandon Harris if she continues Biden\u2019s pro-war policy. The \u201cuncommitted\u201d movement has expanded into a growing coalition that includes other traditional Democratic Party voters, like labour activists, progressive Jews, Black people and Hispanics, and others who support social justice issues. On July 23, for example, seven labour unions representing millions of American workers asked Biden in a joint letter to halt military aid to Israel.\n\nIt is important to point out that opposition to the Biden administration\u2019s policies on Palestine and Israel goes beyond these interest groups. Americans\u2019 backing for Israel\u2019s war is currently at 42 percent; among Democrats it stands at 23 percent. In other words, the vast majority of Harris\u2019s Democratic base does not support Israel\u2019s actions, which the Biden administration has wholeheartedly endorsed.\n\nI asked Huwaida Arraf, a Palestinian-American Michigan-based lawyer, human rights activist, and an \u201cuncommitted\u201d alternate delegate to the Democratic National Convention, whether and how her colleagues expect Harris to respond to their demands. She replied: \u201cTo get our votes, the Democratic Party must fundamentally change course on Gaza specifically, and on Palestine in general. It cannot keep mistreating us, enabling and funding a genocide of our people, then expecting our votes by warning us that the alternative will be worse. Harris is part of an administration that is complicit in genocide and has done nothing to stop it. While she is seen as slightly better than Biden, this is a very low bar, and will not be enough to get our votes. To have a chance, Harris must distance herself from Biden\u2019s policies in a clear and tangible way that goes beyond words. We will no longer accept crumbs.\u201d\n\nThis sentiment is widespread among uncommitted members, who have closely followed Harris\u2019s statements on Gaza. The vice president did not attend Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s congressional address on July 24, but she did meet him the following day.\n\nHer comments after their meeting offered possible hints about her position on Gaza. She called for a ceasefire, a two-state solution, and a stop to the mass suffering of Palestinian civilians, referring to Palestinian women and children in a humanised way that is rarely heard in Washington.\n\nSeasoned Middle East analyst and justice advocate Adam Shapiro, a Brooklyn native currently based in Michigan, told me, \u201cHarris has to be aware the Israeli genocide in Gaza caused the drop in support for Biden, and we have to see if she does anything about that. Her contrast with Biden is often striking in her style and words, but she has spoken well of reducing Palestinian suffering while also supporting the Biden war policy. Skipping the Netanyahu speech is more impressive than her words of concern. Now she must show if she can change her position by the time of the November election in a meaningful way.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic National Convention may give Harris the platform to make clear her position on Israel and its war on Gaza. As the Democratic presidential candidate, she would have more influence than she does now as vice president. To what extent she is willing to distance herself from Biden\u2019s staunch support for Israel\u2019s war may determine how much backing she gains from pro-Palestinian progressive Democrats.\n\n\u201cThe bare minimum [Harris must do] is to declare support for an arms embargo on Israel before the November vote,\u201d Arraf said. A Harris commitment to respecting international law is another area activists are watching, including a commitment to applying relevant US laws on arms transfers that are used in genocide or other human rights abuses. Others say that there can be changes in the party platform overall, announced at the convention in August.\n\nThe 2024 presidential election was always expected to be one of the most consequential presidential votes in modern American history, given the expanding powers of the far right and the fears of Democrats who fret for their democracy. This is now shaping up as an even more historic event not only because it could put a woman of colour in charge of the White House for the first time in US history, but also because it could produce a significant shift in the Democratic Party\u2019s position on Israel-Palestine.\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the author\u2019s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera\u2019s editorial stance.",

        "text": "Trump says he \u2018probably\u2019 will debate Harris but can \u2018make a case for not.\u2019 Her team says he\u2019s scared\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump seems to be backing away from his earlier commitment to debate Vice President Kamala Harris, questioning the value of a meetup and saying he \u201cprobably\u201d will debate but he \u201ccan also make a case for not doing it\u201d \u2014 prompting her campaign to say he\u2019s \u201cscared.\u201d\n\nTrump, in an interview with Fox News Channel that aired Monday night, was pressed several times about committing to debating Harris before giving a squishier answer than he had in recent days.\n\nThe Republican former president had been willing to debate President Joe Biden when Biden was the Democratic nominee after months of suggesting that the president was not mentally up for the matchup \u2014 or the presidency. But after Biden dropped out of the race and Harris became poised to be the Democratic presidential candidate, Trump has been questioning the terms of the original debate he agreed to with Biden. He has suggested the Sept. 10 debate on ABC News should be moved to a different network, calling ABC \u201cfake news.\u201d\n\nLast week, in a phone call with reporters, Trump was asked if he\u2019d commit to debating Harris at least once. He responded: \u201cOh, yes, absolutely. I\u2019d want to,\u201d and he said there was an obligation to debate.\n\nIn the interview Monday, host Laura Ingraham repeatedly pressed Trump on whether he would commit to a debate.\n\nWhat to know about Trump\u2019s second term:\n\nStaffing the administration: Here are the people Trump has picked recess appointments Follow all of our coverage as Donald Trump assembles his second administration.\n\n\u201cI want to do a debate. But I also can say this. Everybody knows who I am. And now people know who she is,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump eventually said, \u201cThe answer is yes, I\u2019ll probably end up debating.\u201d\n\nHe went on for a minute, saying any debates need to be held before early voting starts in states, and then he added, \u201cThe answer is yes, but I can also make a case for not doing it.\u201d\n\nTrump has skipped debates before, including all the 2024 Republican presidential primary debates. He initially didn\u2019t participate after suggesting the timing was too early and then questioning the venue of another before eventually making it clear he would not participate in any of those debates.\n\nHarris campaign spokesperson Ammar Moussa accused Trump of continuing to dodge a face-off with his likely opponent.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear from tonight\u2019s question-dodging: He\u2019s scared he\u2019ll have to defend his running mate\u2019s weird attacks on women or his own calls to end elections in America in a debate against the vice president,\u201d Moussa said.\n\nThe Republican candidate also sought in the interview Monday to clarify comments he made last week at a conservative event in which he told an audience of Christians that they \u201cwon\u2019t have to vote anymore\u201d after he\u2019s elected.\n\nHe urged Christians, who he claims don\u2019t vote in high numbers, to vote \u201cjust this time,\u201d and said, \u201cYou won\u2019t have to do it anymore.\u201d\n\nIn four years, he said: \u201cIt\u2019ll be fixed, it\u2019ll be fine. You won\u2019t have to vote anymore, my beautiful Christians.\u201d\n\nHe added moments later: \u201cIn four years, you don\u2019t have to vote again. We\u2019ll have it fixed so good, you\u2019re not gonna have to vote.\u201d\n\nThe comments drew alarm from Democrats and others who noted Trump\u2019s pattern of using authoritarian language, his earlier comments that he would only be a dictator on \u201cday one\u201d and his behavior after losing the 2020 presidential election, in which he refused to accept the results and sought to overturn them.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign and supporters offered various explanations for his comments, and Ingraham prodded him to explain what he meant.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t vote, and I\u2019m explaining that to \u2018em. \u2018You never vote.\u2019 This time, vote. I\u2019ll straighten out the country. You won\u2019t have to vote anymore. I won\u2019t need your vote,\u201d Trump said.\n\nIngraham asked if he meant Christians won\u2019t need to vote for him because he will only have four years in office.\n\nTrump started his answer by speaking about voting rates of Christians and gun owners, and Ingraham interrupted to ask him again.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about the future. Vote, on, you have to vote on November 5th. After that, you don\u2019t have to worry about voting anymore. I don\u2019t care because we\u2019re going to fix up \u2014 the country will be fixed and we won\u2019t even need your vote anymore because, frankly, we will have such love. If you don\u2019t want to vote anymore, that\u2019s OK,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump made similar comments last month at another Christian-focused event, in which he lamented the voting rates of Christians and implored them to participate in the election.\n\n\u201cIn four years, you don\u2019t have to vote, OK? In four years, don\u2019t vote. I don\u2019t care,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Adriana Gomez Lic\u00f3n in West Palm Beach, Fla., contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow the AP\u2019s coverage of the 2024 election at https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024.",

        "text": "July 30, 2024, presidential campaign news\nFar from the boring rematch that had many Americans tuning out politics, the 2024 presidential election has had wild twists and scary turns.\n\nNobody expected President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign to implode in less than a month, from the shock of his performance at CNN\u2019s debate in late June to his decision to step aside in the race in late July. Democrats went from literally freaking out about his candidacy to a new excitement about Vice President Kamala Harris as his replacement.\n\nNobody expected an assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump, an event that unified Republicans around him and has many in his party showing a sort of divine reverence for his near-death experience.\n\nSo we don\u2019t know specifically what will happen in the sprint to Election Day on November 5, or what could come after, when the country\u2019s unique Electoral College process gets going. But we do have some idea of what to expect:\n\nAugust: Nominating Harris, picking a VP and a convention in Chicago: While the Democratic Party almost immediately rallied around Harris as its nominee, it still needs to officially select her. Delegates will do that in short order, between August 1 and August 7, before the convention, a backstop maneuver to ward against ballot changes.\n\nHarris will also need to pick a running mate. Look for that to occur soon, according to CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny, and not right before the convention, as frequently occurs.\n\nIn late August, Democrats will convene in Chicago for their convention. Expect the most incredible reception for Biden. Democrats have pivoted from worrying over his election prospects to lionizing him as a hero.\n\nEarlier in the month, Sen. JD Vance, Trump\u2019s running mate, turns 40. He\u2019d be the third-youngest vice president in US history and the first millennial in nationwide elected office if the Republican ticket wins. With Biden out of the race, Vance is on the ticket with the oldest major-party nominee in history with Trump, a baby boomer.\n\nRead more about what to expect with the presidential election less than 100 days away.",

        "text": "Polling expert draws early conclusions from Harris vs. Trump\nA couple weeks back, the 2024 presidential race was upended by the decision of President Joe Biden not to seek reelection. Since then, political pundits have scrambled to assess the new Harris-Trump dynamic. The dust is settling on a flurry of polls, and we asked UCR polling and survey expert Andy Crosby, an assistant professor in the School of Public Policy, to weigh in on trends. He approached his assessment below from the perspectives of Harris\u2019 introduction to the race; the effect of JD Vance as the GOP\u2019s vice presidential choice, and the importance of considering trends not in the popular vote, but in the electoral college vote.\n\nThe Introduction of VP Harris\n\nOne of the largest stories in polling has been President Biden announcing he would not continue his bid for re-election and his endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris as his replacement on the Democratic ticket.\n\nOverall, the race remains close. A recent New York Times/Siena College poll conducted July 22-24 shows that Donald Trump has a slight lead over Vice President Kamala Harris, with 48% of respondents indicating they would vote for Trump if the election were held today, compared to 47% of respondents that indicated they would vote for Harris. These results are within the poll\u2019s margin of error of 3.3%.\n\nAndy Crosby\n\nOne of the changes we have seen is an increase in Vice President Harris\u2019 favorability in the polls recently. In an ABC News/Ipsos poll released on Sunday, 43% of respondents reported having a favorable view of Harris, compared to just 35% one week ago. Harris\u2019 favorability rating is also now higher than both President Joe Biden (37%) and former President Donald Trump (36%). A large majority of Democrats are also enthusiastic about Harris\u2019 candidacy: 88% of respondents reported being either \u201cvery enthusiastic\u201d or \u201csomewhat enthusiastic\u201d about Harris\u2019 candidacy.\n\nAlthough Vice President Harris is almost certain to be the Democratic nominee, keep in mind that she has only been campaigning for just over one week, and we may see some movement in the polls over the coming weeks as voters get to know her more and we potentially see a presidential debate. In addition, Vice President Harris will also soon announce her running mate, and her running mate may also have something of an effect on polls, particularly in certain states that are the home state of a potential running mate (more on that below).\n\nThe Introduction of Sen. JD Vance\n\nIn addition to Vice President Harris, we also have another newcomer to our political polling for the presidential election: Republican vice-presidential candidate Senator JD Vance of Ohio. The New York Times/Siena College poll mentioned above shows slightly more respondents viewing Vance unfavorably than favorably (36% favorable, 40% unfavorable). In the ABC News/Ipsos poll mentioned above, which is slightly more recent, 24% of respondents indicated they had a favorable opinion of Vance, and 39% indicated they had an unfavorable opinion. Notably, a considerable portion of respondents in the ABC News/Ispos poll responded that they either had no opinion of Vance (17%) or they did not know (19%). Like Harris, we may see movement in these results as voters get to know Vance more and we may potentially see a televised debate featuring him and the Democratic vice-presidential nominee.\n\nThe States, the States, the States\n\nYou might be wondering: what should someone make of all of this recent polling data? A well-known saying from the late Tim Russert in the 2000 Presidential Election was \u201cFlorida, Florida, Florida,\u201d written on a small board in marker and referring to the fact that the presidential election that year would come down to the votes in just one state. If there is one single thing that I would emphasize 100 days out until the November election, it is the importance of watching polling in individual states. Although national polls are interesting to watch and may inform us of how the country overall is feeling, we also need to keep in mind that we do not elect presidents on a national basis in the United States. Instead, we use the Electoral College. Because of this, watching individual state polls \u2013 particularly battleground states such as Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin \u2013 may be more useful to predict the election than national polls. We are just starting to see Vice President Harris included in these state polls.\n\nThe importance of battleground states is also one reason that Vice President Harris may select a running mate who is popular in a battleground state, such as Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona or Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania. Although these potential vice-presidential candidates do not register large percentages of either favorable or unfavorable views at this point in the race, this is mostly because they are not as well-known outside of their home states. That will likely change once voters get to know the candidate.\n\nWith less than 100 days to go, keep your eyes on the states!",

NPR's Steve Inskeep asks economist Francisco Rodriguez if and how the U.S. should respond.\n\nLEILA FADEL, HOST:\n\nThe opposition leader in Venezuela, Edmundo Gonzalez - he ran against longtime President Nicolas Maduro - says his campaign now has proof that he won Sunday's presidential election. Thousands of protesters took to the streets across the country in protest of Maduro's continued rule, and global leaders are expressing skepticism and concern after the country's electoral authority declared Maduro the president. Again, here's U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nANTONY BLINKEN: It's critical that every vote be counted fairly and transparently, that election officials immediately share information with the opposition and independent observers without delay. And that the electoral authorities publish the detailed tabulation of votes. The international community is watching this very closely and will respond accordingly.\n\nFADEL: Some countries, including the U.S., have held off recognizing the results. For a sense of the global implications of this election and claims of fraud in Venezuela, including its impact on the U.S., we're joined now by Francisco Rodriguez. He's a Venezuelan economist and professor at the University of Denver. Good morning. Thanks for being on the program.\n\nFRANCISCO RODRIGUEZ: Good morning.\n\nFADEL: So let's start with the legitimacy of the election. There wasn't violence. Voters voted on electronic voting machines. Is it clear there was fraud here?\n\nRODRIGUEZ: Well, it's apparent that there was fraud. Right now, what we have are essentially two sets of results. There are results that have been announced by the government...\n\nFADEL: Yeah.\n\nRODRIGUEZ: ...And by the electoral council, which is controlled by the government. Those put Maduro ahead. And we have the opposition now releasing its own results that say that it won by a massive margin, by a two-to-one margin. The opposition has started uploading the detailed results by voting center and allowing people to verify the results in their voting center. The government has not published disaggregated results. The government has simply published an aggregate number. The electoral council website is down. So there's definitely very serious indication that there's something going on here with the results, and that the results may have been altered, but this really merits an independent investigation, and it merits a very close look at these results with the disaggregated poll results that the electoral authorities have yet to publish.\n\nFADEL: Now, Venezuela has one of the world's largest oil reserves in the world. And under Maduro's rule, the economy has suffered, oil prices dropped, hyperinflation. Millions of Venezuelans have left. But I want to ask you why this election matters so much to the world, and particularly to the U.S. And why does it matter?\n\nRODRIGUEZ: Well, Venezuela has been isolated from the world economy since the U.S. imposed sanctions in 2019. So let's remember that Maduro's previous reelection was also seen as illegitimate, and Venezuela's oil production has plummeted and even though the country has the world's largest oil resource by some accounts, it's producing less than 1 million barrels a day. So it's definitely important for Venezuela to have a transition to a democratic system with an internationally recognized government, not just for and primarily, so that Venezuelans can express themselves and have a government of their own choosing, but also to reinsert Venezuela into the world economy, to be able to recover the economy from the huge collapse Venezuela's GDP per capital has suffered. It's declined by more than 71%. That's the equivalent of three Great Depressions. And it's the largest economic contraction ever seen outside of wartime. And also because the country has seen a mass exodus of more than a quarter of its population, and that has meant millions of Venezuelans living in Colombia and Peru and trying to come into the U.S. It's fueling the U.S. migrant crisis. So there's definitely spillover effects into the region, into the world, into the U.S.\n\nFADEL: You mentioned the number of people coming into the U.S. The U.S. has taken extreme interest in Maduro's rule. It's imposed sanctions in the past. Maduro insists he won this election. What will the U.S. do now?\n\nRODRIGUEZ: Well, the U.S. doesn't have actually that many libers because it's already significantly sanctioned Venezuela. Now, the U.S. did start lifting and easing some of those sanctions two years ago in order to get Venezuela reinserted into global markets. And also, as a result of negotiations with the Venezuelan government, that were supposed to lead to free and fair elections. Now, the U.S. can roll back some of these sanctions - I mean, reimpose some of the sanctions, roll back some of the sanctions relief, but that's something that has to be done very carefully because the economic sanctions imposed in Venezuela have also contributed to the country's economic crisis. So here, if the US reimposes sanctions and tries to block off Venezuela and oil exports again, it could simply contribute to a deepening of the country's crisis and to an increase in migrant influxes.\n\nFADEL: That's Francisco Rodriguez. He's a Venezuelan economist and professor at the University of Denver. Thank you so much for your time.\n\nRODRIGUEZ: Thank you.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 NPR. All rights reserved.

        "text": "US officials voice \"serious concerns\" over contested outcome of Venezuela election\nFollowing an election clouded by irregularities, the Biden administration on Monday called on Venezuela's electoral authority to release detailed polling data to support its claim that the country's autocratic leader Nicolas Maduro has secured a third six-year term -- a contested outcome that could have significant ramifications for the region and fuel debate over immigration in the run-up to the U.S. presidential election.\n\n\"We have serious concerns that the result announced does not reflect the will or the votes of the Venezuelan people,\" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said during a news conference in Tokyo.\n\n\"It's critical that every vote be counted fairly and transparently that election officials immediately share information with the opposition and independent observers without delay,\" he continued.\n\nDespite challenges from Maduro's political opposition and unanswered questions from South American officials acting as impartial observers, Venezuela's electoral council, which is aligned with Maduro's regime, formalized the results of the vote, effectively handing the ruler another six-year term.\n\nVenezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado talks to the media next to opposition presidential candidate Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia, following the presidential election results in Caracas on July 29, 2024. Federico Parra/AFP via Getty Images\n\nMaduro has responded with defiance.\n\n\"We have always been victims of the powerful,\" Maduro asserted during a nationally televised ceremony on Monday. \"An attempt is being made to impose a coup d'\u00e9tat in Venezuela again of a fascist and counterrevolutionary nature.\"\n\nMar\u00eda Corina Machado, the opposition popular leader, asserted that, despite Maduro's claims, her party's candidate had won an \"overwhelming\" victory and that the reported polling results were \"impossible.\"\n\nVenezuelan President Nicolas Maduro holds up his certification from the National Electoral Council (CNE) that declares him the winner of the presidential election, at the CNE in Caracas, Venezuela, July 29, 2024. Matias Delacroix/AP\n\nIn the weeks preceding the election, the prospect of Maduro clinging to power has stoked fears of increased economic turmoil and political violence that experts say could spark another exodus from the country.\n\nAlmost 8 million Venezuelans -- roughly a quarter of the country's population -- have left the country over the last decade, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency.\n\nThat diaspora has exacerbated irregular migration to the U.S. In 2023, border patrol agents encountered Venezuelan migrants attempting to enter through the southern border nearly 335,000 times, data from the Department of Homeland Security shows.\n\nThe Biden administration has attempted to curb the number of crossings through multiple initiatives, including by introducing a new policy allowing Venezuelans to apply for entry to the U.S. from abroad, resuming deportations of Venezuelan migrants, and even using diplomatic leverage to push Maduro to hold the country's most recent election.\n\nDespite the changes and modest improvements to Venezuela\u2019s economy, data shows that the number of the country\u2019s nationals crossing between checkpoints on the U.S.-Mexico border has remained elevated. Polling conducted by a Venezuelan-based research firm earlier this year found that roughly a quarter of the country\u2019s current population was considering emigrating if Maduro won the election.\n\nProtesters demonstrate against the official election results declaring President Nicolas Maduro the winner, the day after the presidential election in Caracas, Venezuela, July 29, 2024. Matias Delacroix/AP\n\nSenior Biden administration officials defended their handling of Maduro's government, including using economic incentives to entice Maduro to take steps aimed at moving the country towards democracy.\n\n\"That Venezuela did, in fact, hold an election yesterday, which allowed an opposition candidate to be on the ballot and for a voting process to unfold only came about as a result of the calibrations that we've done with our sanctions policy over the last year,\" one official said.\n\nThe driving factors behind Venezuela's immigration crisis are also complicated. A high-ranking State Department official who served under President Donald Trump told the Washington Post he warned the former administration that imposing hardline sanctions would \"grind the Venezuelan economy into dust & have huge human consequences, one of which would be out-migration.\"\n\nOpponents of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's government bang pots and pans during a protest at the El Valle neighborhood in Caracas on July 29, 2024, a day after the Venezuelan presidential election. Federico Parra/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe Biden administration has largely kept Trump's economic penalties on Venezuela in place, but it has made some notable carveout, including granting authorizations to select companies permitting them to operate in the country's lucrative oil sector.\n\nIn the wake of Maduro's handling of the election, officials indicated that they would not revoke existing sanctions but that they would rethink their approach to Venezuela based on whether the government increases transparency surrounding the election.\n\n\"We're watching. The world watching. I won't get ahead of a decision hasn't been made here in terms of consequences. We're going to hold our judgment until we see the actual tabulation of the results,\" National Security Spokesperson John Kirby said on Monday.",

        "text": "Harris and Trump release dueling ads as candidates refine their messaging\nKamala Harris and Donald Trump released dueling campaign ads on Tuesday, as the reshaped US presidential election began to grind into gear with 98 days to go.\n\nThe US vice-president\u2019s ad, Fearless, was her first since she became the de facto Democratic nominee, after Joe Biden halted his re-election campaign and endorsed her.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump wants to take our country backward,\u201d Harris said. \u201cTo give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations and end the Affordable Care Act. But we are not going back.\u201d\n\nThe former president\u2019s ad, I Don\u2019t Understand, used a snippet of Harris answering a question about immigration policy to bolster a hardline message about drugs, crime, terrorism and the southern border.\n\nShowing footage of her dancing, Trump\u2019s ad called Harris \u201cfailed, weak, dangerously liberal\u201d.\n\nHarris\u2019s campaign hit back against Trump, pointing to the Republican\u2019s role in directing congressional Republicans to reject bipartisan border reform.\n\n\u201cAfter killing the toughest border deal in decades, Donald Trump is running on his trademark lies because his own record and \u2018plans\u2019 are extreme and unpopular,\u201d Ammar Moussa, a Harris campaign spokesperson, told reporters.\n\nHarris has been the presumptive Democratic nominee for little more than a week \u2013 but she has made an extremely strong start, reeling in more than $200m and appearing to make up ground in the polls.\n\nShe is still considering her own vice-presidential pick. But on Monday, Trump\u2019s Republican running mate, the hardline Ohio senator JD Vance, was revealed to have made a telling admission about the strength of Harris\u2019s start.\n\nIn remarks at a fundraiser in Minnesota last weekend, reported by the Washington Post and referring to Biden\u2019s decision to give in to those who said he was too old for a second term, Vance said: \u201cAll of us were hit with a little bit of a political sucker punch.\n\n\u201cThe bad news is that Kamala Harris does not have the same baggage as Joe Biden, because whatever we might have to say, Kamala is a lot younger. And Kamala Harris is obviously not struggling in the same ways that Joe Biden did.\u201d\n\nBiden is 81, and Harris is 59. Trump is 78, making him the oldest presidential nominee of all time. The language of Harris\u2019s new ad pointed to Democratic determination to target Trump\u2019s age \u2013 and to portray him as backward-looking and a thing of the past, now that their own old man is out of the campaign picture.\n\nThe Harris campaign is also keen to point to its fundraising efforts, which as the new ad was released saw a \u201cWhite Dudes for Harris\u201d Zoom call featuring celebrities including the actor Jeff Bridges, who famously played Jeffrey \u201cThe Dude\u201d Lebowski. The campaign said it raised $4m.\n\nFive years before Bridges made The Big Lebowski, he played the lead role in Fearless, a 1993 movie about a man whose behaviour is changed after he survives a plane crash.\n\nIn a statement accompanying the Fearless ad, the Harris campaign chairperson, Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon, saluted Democrats\u2019 own dramatic shift in fortunes, from plummeting polls under Biden to soaring hopes under Harris.\n\n\u201cKamala Harris has always stood up to bullies, criminals and special interests on behalf of the American people \u2013 and she\u2019s beaten them,\u201d O\u2019Malley Dillon said, echoing the ad\u2019s citation of Harris\u2019s work as attorney general of California, as well as her time as a US senator and vice-president.\n\n\u201cThis $50m paid media campaign, bolstered by our record-setting fundraising haul and a groundswell of grassroots enthusiasm, is one crucial way we will reach and make our case to the voters who will decide this election.\u201d\n\nThe Harris campaign plans to air its ad prominently over three weeks, including amid coverage of the Olympic Games in Paris.\n\nThe Trump campaign is also reportedly focusing on Arizona, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Nevada, Georgia and Michigan \u2013 the key battleground states.",

'See my assessment below on the 13 Keys Tracker on where The Keys stand NOW.'Harris filed her nomination on July 27 officially and declared her candidature for President race.Harris has an upper hand in this election because of the several key factors like she faced no primary challenger, there has been minimal threat from third-party candidates, and the economy remains strong both in the short and long term.With the transition from Biden to Harris, the White House has avoided major policy changes, and Harris is not contending with any scandals or significant social unrest.Lichtman observed that with Biden\u2019s shift to Harris as the presumptive nominee, the Democrats have lost the incumbency advantage. As Harris and Republican candidate Donald Trump prepare to face off, Lichtman considers the race essentially open, reported The Daily Mail.However, Lichtman also pointed out that the Democrats have managed to mitigate potential fallout from this transition. The party has rallied behind Harris without triggering a chaotic open primary or attracting other presidential contenders at this late stage.\"I have not made a final prediction. I've said I will make it after the Democratic convention,\" Lichtman told C-SPAN.\"But I have said for months, and I continue to say a lot would have to go wrong for Democrats to lose... That could happen, but a lot would have to change.\"Lichtman also said the new energy injected into the Harris campaign could have a positive effect on several keys for her including less people voting for third party candidate Robert Kennedy Jr. and it could further stall social unrest.Lichtman's forecast comes as the latest polls show that Harris and Trump are in neck-to -neck competition in the presidential race.",

File Image/Reuters\n\nThe controversy surrounding Google, led by Sundar Pichai, has escalated as Trump supporters accuse the tech giant of election interference. The issue arose when Google\u2019s autocomplete function failed to suggest information about an attempted assassination of former United States President Donald Trump, sparking outrage among his supporters.\n\nThe autocomplete feature provided suggestions for historical assassination attempts on figures like Ronald Reagan and John F Kennedy but did not include Trump, despite the incident occurring on July 13 in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis omission has led to accusations of bias against Google, with claims that the company is manipulating information to influence the upcoming 2024 US presidential election.\n\nHow have Republicans reacted?\n\nThe incident prompted a strong reaction from Trump supporters and prominent Republican figures. Donald Trump Jr. expressed his frustration on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, stating, \u201cBig Tech is trying to interfere in the election AGAIN to help Kamala Harris.\u201d\n\nBig Tech is trying to interfere in the election AGAIN to help Kamala Harris. We all know this is intentional election interference from Google. Truly despicable. https://t.co/gWDbFGaHI7 \u2014 Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) July 28, 2024\n\nHe accused Google of intentionally suppressing information about the assassination attempt, viewing it as an effort to aid US Vice President Kamala Harris in the election. Trump\u2019s supporters have long suspected Google of bias, especially given the company\u2019s alleged suppression of information related to US President Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter Biden.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRepublican US Senator Roger Marshall also voiced his concerns, sharing a screenshot that highlighted Google\u2019s omission. He questioned, \u201cWhy is @Google suppressing the search about the Trump assassination attempt? Has there been a dramatic increase in (Harry) Truman biographers in the last two weeks?\u201d\n\nWhy is @Google suppressing the search about the Trump assassination attempt? These are all screenshots from this morning. Has there been a dramatic increase in Truman biographers in the last two weeks?\n\n\n\nI\u2019ll be making an official inquiry into @google this week - I look forward\u2026 pic.twitter.com/GD5SOvvcdX \u2014 Dr. Roger Marshall (@RogerMarshallMD) July 28, 2024\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe accusations extended to Pichai himself, with some suggesting that his Indian heritage influenced his supposed support for Harris, also of Indian descent. One post on X read, \u201cSundar Pichai top boss at google is\u2026doing everything in his power to ensure the next president is of India descent,\u201d while another labelled him a \u201csocialist\u201d favouring \u201cMarxists who run the DNC.\u201d\n\nHow did Google respond?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn response to the controversy, a Google spokesperson clarified that the company\u2019s systems have built-in protections against autocomplete predictions related to political violence, which were functioning as intended.\n\nSundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet, attends the inauguration of a new hub in France dedicated to the artificial intelligence (AI) sector, at the Google France headquarters in Paris, France, February 15, 2024. File Image/Reuters\n\nThe spokesperson stated, \u201cWe\u2019re working on improvements to ensure our systems are more up to date. Of course, Autocomplete is just a tool to help people save time, and they can still search for anything they want to.\u201d Despite this explanation, the issue continued to draw criticism, with many arguing that the omission was a deliberate act of bias.\n\nHow did Musk & Meta get involved?\n\nElon Musk, owner of X, also became involved in the controversy. Musk, who has openly supported Trump, posted a screenshot showing a Google search for \u201cPresident Donald\u201d that suggested \u201cPresident Donald Duck\u201d instead of \u201cPresident Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWow, Google has a search ban on President Donald Trump!\n\n\n\nElection interference? pic.twitter.com/dJzgVAAFZA \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 29, 2024\n\nMusk sarcastically questioned whether this was an instance of \u201cElection interference?\u201d He further commented on the significant donations from Alphabet (Google\u2019s parent company) employees to Biden\u2019s campaign, implying a bias within the company.\n\nProbably just a coincidence that Alphabet (Google) employees were the top donors to Biden https://t.co/H02dxmKPkL pic.twitter.com/tIj0THeTVc \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 29, 2024\n\nMeta, another tech giant, faced criticism for a similar issue. The company\u2019s AI chatbot, Meta AI, was accused of providing misleading information about the Trump assassination attempt. In one instance, the bot incorrectly labelled the event as \u201cfictional.\u201d\n\nMeta later apologised, acknowledging that the incident was an error and stating, \u201cWe know people have been seeing incomplete, inconsistent, or out of date information on this topic. We\u2019re in the process of implementing a fix to provide more up-to-date responses for inquiries, and it is possible people may continue to see inaccurate responses in the meantime.\u201d\n\nWhat political implications are we looking at?\n\nThe allegations of bias against Google and other tech giants have significant political implications, especially as the US approaches the 2024 presidential election. Trump\u2019s supporters view the perceived manipulation of information as a form of election interference designed to disadvantage their candidate.\n\nThe controversy has fueled calls for investigations, with some Republican lawmakers pledging to look into the matter.\n\nRepublican presidential candidate former US President Donald Trump is surrounded by US Secret Service agents after an assassination attempt at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, July 13, 2024. File Image/AP\n\nThe situation has also highlighted the broader issue of Big Tech\u2019s role in shaping public discourse and information. With past incidents of social media platforms banning Trump following the January 6, 2021, US Capitol riot, the debate over tech companies\u2019 influence in politics remains a hot topic.",

        "text": "Kamala Harris has a different view on Gaza to Joe Biden \u2013 it could win her votes in November \u2022 City, University of London\nDr Andrew Payne writes for The Conversation about how Kamala Harris' different stance on Israel/Gaza might win her more votes in the upcoming US presidential election.\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu\u2019s July visit to Washington has placed the political spotlight on divisions within the Democratic party over the war in Gaza. After Joe Biden\u2019s withdrawal from the presidential race, the presumptive Democratic nominee, Kamala Harris, inherits a politically thorny issue. It\u2019s an issue that has plagued the president since the Hamas attacks in October 2023.\n\nHarris will need to strike a difficult balance between explaining how she would chart a distinctive path on Israel and Palestine, while also defending the record of an administration in which she still serves.\n\nThe vice president\u2019s record on the issue so far \u2013 and her decision not to preside over Netanyahu\u2019s speech in Congress \u2013 have stoked hopes in progressive circles that the she may adopt a tougher position towards Israel. Such a shift could be vital in convincing pro-Palestinian voters disillusioned with Biden to turn out for her in November.\n\nVice presidents tend to toe the party line on foreign affairs. But Harris has been unusually outspoken on US policy towards the Middle East. In December, for example, she delivered a speech in Dubai after meeting with leaders of several Arab states, in which she expressed concern about the scale of civilian suffering in Gaza.\n\nShe did reaffirm the Biden administration\u2019s position regarding Israel\u2019s right to defend itself against Hamas. But she also insisted that \u201cinternational humanitarian law must be respected\u201d, implying that Israel\u2019s conduct risked falling short of that standard. \u201cAs Israel defends itself, it matters how,\u201d she said.\n\nIn March, Harris was the first senior administration official to call for an \u201cimmediate ceasefire\u201d. She was again sharp in her criticism of the Israeli government\u2019s handling of the humanitarian dimensions of its war, which had led to \u201cinhumane conditions\u201d in Gaza.\n\nIn remarks that were strong enough to prompt National Security Council officials to intervene and tone them down, Harris declared: \u201cOur common humanity compels us to act.\u201d She called for Netanyahu\u2019s government to \u201cdo more to significantly increase the flow of aid. No excuses.\u201d\n\nRealistically, conventional political wisdom in the US suggests that Harris faces an uphill task in translating whatever daylight exists between her and Biden into electoral success in November. The US public is said to know little, and care less, about international affairs. So, when most people enter polling booths, it is kitchen-table issues \u2013 inflation, interest rates and immigration \u2013 that determine who wins their vote.\n\nIn fact, the proportion of Americans who rank any foreign policy issue among as the most important problem facing the country averages around 10%-20%. That\u2019s around three times less than the number who identify economic issues as their primary concern. The pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses earlier this year and the demonstrations in Washington this week may therefore exaggerate the importance of an issue that animates only a vocal minority.\n\nLeadership qualities\n\nBut recent research suggests that these stats may give a misleading impression of the way in which individuals assess political candidates. In practice, voters tend to care less about specific issues than whether a candidate has the right personal attributes to be an effective commander-in-chief.\n\nHarris\u2019s comments about the war may help her project a broader image as a leader who is prepared to stand up for certain values on the world stage, such as the importance of upholding international law and protecting human rights. This would be a marked contrast with the position of Donald Trump.\n\nTrump called on Biden during their now infamous 2024 debate in June to let Israel \u201cfinish the job\u201d without further restrictions from Washington, displaying few qualms about the way in which Israel prosecuted its war with Hamas.\n\nThis is important because we know that foreign policy may not feature heavily in polling, but has been shown to affect elections if voters are presented with a clear choice between candidates. Harris and Trump\u2019s positions on Israel illustrate that the choice in 2024 is between a candidate who is committed to defending the rules-based international order and one who has a track record of undermining it.\n\nThere is also a simple mathematical reason why this might matter in November. The outcome of this year\u2019s presidential election is likely to come down to fine margins in a handful of states. These include Michigan, where more than 100,000 young voters and Arab Americans demonstrated their dissatisfaction with the Biden administration\u2019s handling of the war in Gaza by casting \u201cuncommitted\u201d ballots in the state\u2019s Democratic primary in February. This in a state that Trump won in 2016 by just 11,000 votes (but lost in 2020).\n\nEven if foreign policy shifts few votes on a national scale, the position Harris takes on Gaza could be enough to tip the scale in these must-win races.\n\nWhere does this leave Joe Biden?\n\nAssuming he does not bow to pressure from Republican critics calling for his resignation, Biden will still serve as commander-in-chief for another six months. As I have argued in a recent book, presidents in the twilight of their term must still pay attention to the political calendar when making decisions about war and peace.\n\nLike many of his predecessors, Biden is likely to turn to foreign policy as a means of cementing his legacy. A ceasefire agreement in Gaza could be a promising scenario. If the administration were able to broker a deal between Israel and Hamas before the election, it would also help Harris by reducing the salience of a sensitive political issue.\n\nHaving stepped aside in favour of his vice president, Biden (belatedly) aims to become the transitional president he once promised to be. On Israel, he may indeed be the last of his kind.\n\nHarris could yet be the bridge between Biden\u2019s generation of Democratic leaders who share a deep personal bond with the state of Israel, and a younger group of progressives who are much more willing to criticise the policies of the Israeli government.\n\nDr Andrew Payne is a Lecturer in Foreign Policy and Security within the School of Policy & Global Affairs at City, University of London.

Several state-level polls in swing states since Harris announced her candidacy show a tighter race as well.\n\nThe candidates themselves have both implicitly and explicitly acknowledged the altered political map. On the airwaves, both campaigns are launching multimillion-dollar ad buys in the key battleground states. Harris\u2019 campaign is running a spot that highlights her background as a prosecutor and Trump\u2019s video attacks Harris as weak on immigration issues.\n\nHarris held a rally in Atlanta Tuesday night, the largest of the campaign so far, in front of thousands of supporters at Georgia State University\u2019s Convocation Center.\n\n\"Georgia, it is so good to be back, and I am very clear: The path to the White House runs right through this state,\" Harris said to a filled 10,000-person arena. \"And you all helped us win in 2020 \u2014 and we're gonna do it again in 2024!\"\n\nTrump and his vice presidential nominee, Ohio U.S. Sen. JD Vance, will hold a rally at the same location on Saturday.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nGeorgia in particular is seen as an opportunity for the Harris campaign to improve before Election Day.\n\nNearly a third of the electorate is Black, Atlanta\u2019s suburbs are home to a sizable share of moderate voters who have voted for Republicans and Democrats in past elections, and the Harris campaign says it is making record staffing investments.\n\n\u201cIn Georgia, we're running the largest in-state operation of any Democratic presidential campaign cycle ever,\u201d Harris campaign communications director Michael Tyler said to reporters. \u201cSince the vice president began her candidacy, we've seen tremendous energy on the ground.\u201d\n\nThe Trump campaign is not ceding focus on the Sun Belt, though.\n\nVance is campaigning in Nevada and Arizona this week, with a planned appearance at the U.S. southern border on Thursday.\n\nArizona and Georgia are also two primary states where Republicans' \"Trump Force 47\" campaign strategy to use volunteers to lead targeted get-out-the-vote efforts is in full swing.\n\nAs both Trump and Harris continue to make their case to voters in these swing states over the next three months, there are still several key events that could continue to shape the contour of the race, like Harris naming her vice presidential pick, the Democratic National Convention next month in Chicago and any potential debates between Trump and Harris before voting begins.\n\nHarris is set to announce her running mate within days, and the campaign says they will do a series of rallies, a tour that will begin on Tuesday and take them to Philadelphia, western Wisconsin, Detroit, Raleigh, N.C., Savannah, Ga., Phoenix and Las Vegas.\n\nNPR's Deepa Shivaram contributed reporting.",

AP correspondent Jennifer King reports.\n\nThis is Maduro\u2019s first concession to demands for more transparency about the election. However, the court is closely aligned with his government; the court\u2019s justices are proposed by federal officials and ratified by the National Assembly, which is dominated by Maduro sympathizers.\n\nThe Carter Center, which sent a delegation to Venezuela to monitor the election, criticized Maduro\u2019s audit request, saying the court would not provide an independent review.\n\n\u201cYou have another government institution, which is appointed by the government, to verify the government numbers for the election results, which are in question,\u201d said Jennie K. Lincoln, who led the delegation. \u201cThis is not an independent assessment.\u201d\n\nA defaced mural of the late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez covers a wall on the side of a highway, next to historic Venezuelan national heroes, following protests against the official election results declaring Chavez\u2019s protege President Nicolas Maduro the winner, in Valencia, Venezuela, on Tuesday, July 30, 2024, two days after the vote.

Venezuela\u2019s electoral authorities allowed the Carter Center to send 17 observers.\n\nMaduro\u2019s main challenger, Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez, and opposition leader Maria Corina Machado say they obtained more than two-thirds of the tally sheets that each electronic voting machine printed after polls closed. They said the release of the data on those tallies would prove Maduro lost.\n\nMaduro insisted to reporters that there had been a plot against his government and that the electoral system was hacked. Asked later on during a news conference why electoral authorities have not released detailed vote counts, Maduro said the National Electoral Council has come under attack, including cyber-attacks.\n\n\u201cEngineers are fighting right now\u201d to solve those attacks, he said without elaborating.\n\nThe government presented some videos that the president said showed people attacking and torching some electoral offices.

The National Electoral Council, which is loyal to his United Socialist Party of Venezuela, has yet to release any results broken down by voting machine, which it did in past elections.\n\nColombian President Gustavo Petro, a close Maduro ally, joined other foreign leaders Wednesday in urging him to release detailed vote counts.\n\n\u201cThe serious doubts that have arisen around the Venezuelan electoral process can lead its people to a deep violent polarization with serious consequences of permanent division,\u201d Petro said on the social platform X.\n\n\u201cI invite the Venezuelan government to allow the elections to end in peace, allowing a transparent vote count, with the counting of votes, and with the supervision of all the political forces of its country and professional international supervision,\u201d he added.\n\nPetro proposed that Maduro\u2019s government and the opposition reach an agreement \u201cthat allows for the maximum respect of the (political) force that has lost the elections.\u201d The agreement, he said, could be submitted to the United Nations Security Council.\n\nHis comments came a day after another ally, Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, along with U.S. President Joe Biden, called for the \u201cimmediate release of full, transparent, and detailed voting data at the polling station level.\u201d\n\nVenezuelan President Nicolas Maduro shakes hands with Supreme Court justices upon arrival to the Court in Caracas, Venezuela, Wednesday, July 31, 2024, three days after his disputed reelection.

Instead, it pointed to a Monday statement from the Ministry for Foreign Relations saying the government awaits \u201cthe publication by the National Electoral Council of data broken down by polling station, an indispensable step for the transparency, credibility and legitimacy of the election result.\u201d\n\nLula said of Maduro on Tuesday that \u201cthe more transparency there is, the greater his chance of having peace to govern Venezuela.\u201d\n\nThe Organization of American States convened for an extraordinary session Wednesday, but members were unable to reach a consensus on a resolution to pressure Venezuelan authorities to \u201cimmediately\u201d publish the granular results and verify them in the presence of international observers. Seventeen nations voted in favor of the resolution, one short of the threshold required for passage.

That is widely different from the electoral council\u2019s report that Maduro received 5.1 million votes, against more than 4.4 million for Gonz\u00e1lez.\n\nVenezuela has the world\u2019s largest proven crude reserves and once boasted Latin America\u2019s most advanced economy, but it entered into free fall after Maduro took the helm in 2013. Plummeting oil prices, widespread shortages and hyperinflation that soared past 130,000% led to social unrest and mass emigration.\n\nMore than 7.7 million Venezuelans have left the country since 2014, the largest exodus in Latin America\u2019s recent history. Many have settled in Colombia.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Vietnam on Wednesday, the European Union\u2019s foreign affairs chief said the bloc won\u2019t recognize Maduro\u2019s claim of electoral victory without independent verification of voting records.\n\n\u201cThey should have been provided immediately, as in any democratic electoral process,\u201d Josep Borrell said.\n\nWithin hours of the electoral council saying Maduro had won, thousands of protesters took to the streets of Caracas and other cities. The protests, which continued into Tuesday, turned violent at times, and law enforcement responded with tear gas and rubber pellets.\n\nThe Venezuela-based human rights organization Foro Penal said 11 people, including two minors, were killed in election-related unrest.\n\nElection workers prepare polling stations in Caracas, Venezuela, Friday, July 26, 2024.

The opposition figures said the release of the data on those tallies would prove Maduro lost the election.\n\nPressure has been building against Maduro. The National Electoral Council, which is loyal to the ruling United Socialist Party of Venezuela, has yet to release any printed results from polling centers as it did in past elections.\n\nREAD MORE: Venezuela in political standoff after both Maduro and opposition claim election victory\n\nHis close ally, Colombian President Gustavo Petro, on Wednesday joined other foreign leaders in urging him to release detailed vote counts. A day earlier, another of Maduro\u2019s allies, Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, along with U.S. President Joe Biden called for the \u201cimmediate release of full, transparent, and detailed voting data at the polling station level.\u201d\n\nMachado said the vote tallies the opposition has obtained show Gonz\u00e1lez received roughly 6.2 million votes compared with 2.7 million for Maduro. That is widely different from the electoral council\u2019s report that Maduro received 5.1 million votes, against more than 4.4 million for Gonz\u00e1lez.\n\n\u201cThe serious doubts that have arisen around the Venezuelan electoral process can lead its people to a deep violent polarization with serious consequences of permanent division,\u201d Petro said Wednesday in a post on social media site X.\n\n\u201cI invite the Venezuelan government to allow the elections to end in peace, allowing a transparent vote count, with the counting of votes, and with the supervision of all the political forces of its country and professional international supervision,\u201d he added.\n\nPetro proposed that Maduro\u2019s government and the opposition reach an agreement \u201cthat allows for the maximum respect of the (political) force that has lost the elections.\u201d The agreement, he said, could be submitted to the United Nations Security Council.\n\nVenezuela has the world\u2019s largest proven crude reserves and once boasted Latin America\u2019s most advanced economy, but it entered into free fall after Maduro took the helm in 2013. Plummeting oil prices, widespread shortages and hyperinflation that soared past 130,000% led to social unrest and mass emigration.\n\nMore than 7.7 million Venezuelans have left the country since 2014, the largest exodus in Latin America\u2019s recent history. Many have settled in Colombia.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Vietnam on Wednesday, the European Union\u2019s foreign affairs chief said the bloc won\u2019t recognize Maduro\u2019s claim of electoral victory without independent verification of voting records.\n\n\u201cThey should have been provided immediately, as in any democratic electoral process,\u201d Josep Borrell said.\n\nThe Carter Center, an independent U.S.-based institution that evaluates elections, said late Tuesday it was unable to verify the results of Venezuela\u2019s presidential election, blaming authorities for a \u201ccomplete lack of transparency\u201d in declaring Maduro the winner without providing any individual polling tallies.\n\nREAD MORE: Across Venezuela, statues of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez are being attacked over alleged stolen election\n\nThe group was authorized earlier this year by Venezuela\u2019s electoral authorities to send experts to observe the election. It had 17 experts spread out in four cities on Sunday.\n\n\u201cThe electoral authority\u2019s failure to announce disaggregated results by polling station constitutes a serious breach of electoral principles,\u201d the Carter Center said, adding that the election did not meet international standards and \u201ccannot be considered democratic.\u201d\n\nWithin hours of the electoral council announcing Monday that Maduro had won, thousands of protesters took to the streets of the capital, Caracas, and other cities. The protests, which continued into Tuesday, turned violent at times, and law enforcement responded with tear gas and gun pellets.\n\nAttorney General Tarek William Saab on Tuesday told reporters that more than 700 protesters were arrested in nationwide demonstrations Monday and that one officer was killed.\n\nThe Venezuela-based human rights organization Foro Penal also on Tuesday reported that 11 people, including two minors, had been killed in unrest related to the election.\n\nThe Organization of American States was set to gather Wednesday to discuss Venezuela\u2019s election.\n\nMaduro\u2019s closest ruling party allies quickly came to his defense. National Assembly President Jorge Rodriguez \u2014 his chief negotiator in dialogues with the U.S. and the opposition \u2014 insisted Maduro was the indisputable winner and called his opponents violent fascists.\n\nPraising the arrests of the protesters, he said Machado should be jailed and so should Gonz\u00e1lez, \u201cbecause he is the leader of the fascist conspiracy that is trying to impose itself in Venezuela.\u201d\n\nIn a Spanish-language post on X, the EU\u2019s Borrell urged Venezuelan authorities to \u201cend detentions, repression and violent rhetoric against members of the opposition,\u201d calling threats against Gonz\u00e1lez and Machado \u201cunacceptable.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Machado and Gonz\u00e1lez urged their supporters to remain calm and avoid violence.\n\n\u201cI ask Venezuelans to continue in peace, demanding that the result be respected and the tally sheets be published,\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez said on X. \u201cThis victory, which belongs to all of us, will unite us and reconcile us as a nation.\u201d\n\nAssociated Press writer Ella Joyner in Brussels contributed.",

        "text": "The US election and NATO: What\u2019s at stake\nSeveral developments in the U.S. presidential race, including former President Donald Trump\u2019s pick of JD Vance as vice president earlier this month, have left European NATO member countries worried as they contemplate the possibility of the U.S. reducing its leadership role in the treaty organization \u2014 or pulling out altogether \u2014 analysts say.\n\nAmerican presidents from both parties have long criticized a lack of burden sharing within NATO, pointing to many countries not matching the 2% of GDP defense spending commitment. With the upcoming U.S. presidential election and Trump and Vance\u2019s criticisms of the alliance, NATO\u2019s future is effectively on the ballot, some foreign policy experts say.\n\nTrump has frequently criticized NATO countries for placing a financial burden on the U.S., warning that if they do not increase their contributions, he might consider reducing America\u2019s involvement in the alliance or withdrawing completely.\n\n\u201cNATO has to treat the U.S. fairly, because if it\u2019s not for the United States, NATO literally doesn\u2019t even exist,\u201d Trump said in a March interview.\n\nThe U.S. spent 3.49% of its GDP on defense in 2023, while 19 of 32 NATO countries failed to reach the 2% commitment. This year, 23 out of 32 countries are expected to meet or exceed the defense-spending target, according to NATO.\n\nRELATED\n\nEmbracing Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy platform, Trump and Vance favor isolationism. This raises the question: What does this mean for NATO member countries in need of American assistance, especially Ukraine and neighboring countries around Russia?\n\nEven if Vice President Kamala Harris \u2014 the anticipated Democratic presidential nominee \u2014 wins the election in November, NATO may still face challenges.\n\nA Trump and Vance ticket\n\nKlaus Larres, a history professor at the University of North Carolina and a fellow at the Wilson Center, noted that not all campaign rhetoric translates into actions once in office.\n\nTrump is more skeptical of NATO than President Joe Biden\u2019s administration, but since more countries are meeting the defense spending commitment, that grievance may diminish, Larres said.\n\n\u201cHe probably will not repeat again that he wants to leave NATO, but he probably will make the United States less active in NATO and less prominent and less being the clear leader of NATO,\u201d he said.\n\nLarres said Vance\u2019s inexperience in foreign policy will require a steep learning curve, which could prompt him to reconsider his instinctive isolationism.\n\n\u201cHe is an isolationist, and he wants to withdraw from Ukraine,\u201d Larres said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem to see how detrimental that also would be for the United States and not just for the Europeans or for Ukraine, that it would have really devastating effects on America\u2019s role in the world. He doesn\u2019t seem to understand that.\u201d\n\nWith 40% of global trade involving the U.S. and Europe, a serious strain in relations would harm America not only in security but also in trade and economic policy, Larres said.\n\nRepublican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump and Republican vice presidential candidate Sen.

(Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)\n\nA Harris ticket\n\nHarris is expected to be the Democratic presidential nominee, following Biden\u2019s announcement that he won\u2019t seek reelection. Harris, who as of this writing has not announced a vice presidential candidate, will face a formal nomination at the Democratic National Convention in August.\n\nDuring his presidency, Biden expanded and defended NATO while bringing the Atlantic allies closer together, Larres said. Foreign policy experts expect Harris to continue support for NATO and Ukraine.\n\nIn contrast to the Republican ticket, Harris has indicated she would not stray from NATO.\n\n\u201cI firmly believe our commitment to build and sustain alliances has helped America become the most powerful and prosperous country in the world \u2014 alliances that have prevented wars, defended freedom and maintained stability from Europe to the Indo-Pacific,\u201d Harris said at the Munich Security Conference in February.\n\n\u201cTo put all of that at risk would be foolish,\u201d Harris said.\n\nIn a February rally, Trump said he would encourage Russia to do \u201cwhatever the hell they want\u201d to any NATO country that doesn\u2019t meet the defense spending commitment.\n\nIn response, Harris criticized Trump\u2019s remarks and reaffirmed her opposition to Russian President Vladimir Putin and the war in Ukraine.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Vice President Kamala Harris speaks to supporters during a campaign rally at West Allis Central High School on July 23 in West Allis, Wisconsin. (Photo by Jim Vondruska/Getty Images)\n\n\u201cNo previous U.S. president, regardless of party, has bowed down to a Russian dictator before,\u201d Harris said in an interview.\n\nIn the days leading up to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Harris urged NATO countries to unite and prepare sanctions.\n\nDuring her Munich speech, Harris warned against American isolationism, stating abandoning Ukraine or NATO allies would repeat historical mistakes.\n\n\u201cIf we stand by while an aggressor invades its neighbor with impunity, they will keep going,\u201d she said, noting Putin\u2019s actions could threaten all of Europe.\n\n\u201cIf we fail to impose severe consequences on Russia, other authoritarians across the globe would be emboldened, because you see, they will be watching \u2014 they are watching and drawing lessons.\u201d\n\nThe \u2018bedrock\u2019 of NATO\n\nForeign policy experts warned diminishing America\u2019s involvement in NATO could signal to adversaries abroad they can take advantage of U.S. allies, as America\u2019s military strength is a key deterrent.\n\nElizabeth Saunders, a professor of political science at Columbia University and a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said the U.S. military is the \u201cbedrock\u201d of NATO, and the U.S. nuclear program is still a key part of how NATO deters adversaries, like Russia.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very clear that this dance that NATO countries and Russia are doing on the sort of outer edges of this conflict are designed to prevent direct hostilities between any NATO country and Russia, and that\u2019s why Ukraine rightly believes that its security is tied to whether or not because it can get into NATO,\u201d Saunders said.\n\nOn his campaign website, Trump argued \u201cwe have to finish the process we began under my Administration of fundamentally reevaluating NATO\u2019s purpose and NATO\u2019s mission,\u201d claiming Russia is not the greatest threat to the U.S.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to believe that Russia is the greatest threat to the U.S. to think that it is a threat to U.S. interests,\u201d Saunders said.\n\nHans Binnendijk, a fellow at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security and an adjunct political scientist at the RAND Corporation, said the most acute risk to the U.S. is Russia because the war in Ukraine has the potential for escalation.\n\n\u201cSo, if the alliance is significantly weakened, [Putin] may feel that he can take advantage of that and he goes into the Baltic states, for example, which would be very dangerous,\u201d Binnendijk said.\n\nNATO heads of state and government gathered on the 75th anniversary of NATO's creation in Washington, D.C., on July 9. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\n\nBecause NATO relies heavily on the U.S. for nuclear deterrence, undermining the alliance would weaken its effectiveness, Binnendijk said. As he sees it, the most immediate risk of a Trump and Vance win is Congress failing to agree on future aid for Ukraine. He noted delays in past aid bills have led to shortages of air defense and artillery munitions for Ukraine.\n\n\u201cIf the U.S. just decides to stop aid to Ukraine, Europe can pick up some of it, but certainly not all of it, and it would probably force Ukraine into a very unfavorable situation where they might have to cut a really bad deal with Putin that would in turn do a lot of damage internally to the alliance,\u201d he said.\n\nEven if Trump doesn\u2019t formally withdraw the U.S. from NATO, he could still reduce America\u2019s involvement in ways that undermine the alliance and leave other member countries more vulnerable, Saunders said.\n\nFor example, Trump could refuse to appoint an ambassador to NATO or withdraw U.S. troops from allied countries, Saunders said.\n\n\u201cBut if the fundamentals, if the material and the personnel and the capabilities that you need come from the U.S., then if you don\u2019t have access to those, then you don\u2019t really have NATO in its current form,\u201d Saunders said. \u201cYou have something else that might still be called NATO.\u201d\n\nCristina Stassis is an editorial fellow for Defense News and Military Times, where she covers stories surrounding the defense industry, national security, military/veteran affairs and more.

        "text": "HKS experts evaluate media coverage of the careening U.S. election\nQ: Even major news organizations are facing huge problems just keeping their audiences and staying afloat. What do these economic challenges mean for covering this election?\n\nGibbs: The disruption of the business model for journalism drives many of the troubling trends of recent years; the increase in clickbait, in partisan media, in echo chambers designed to maximize engagement as companies shift from an advertising-based model to a subscription model. But maybe most concerning is if reliable information increasingly becomes a luxury good: those able and willing to pay for the Wall Street Journal or New York Times will have vast amounts of information available to them, but for others, the vacuum will be filled by unreliable and often destructive information sources.\n\nPatterson: I honestly don\u2019t think that the business model has posed a large challenge to presidential election coverage. We don\u2019t lack stories of those candidates. It\u2019s the lower races where the economic challenge is being felt. Most local news outlets have fewer resources to devote to covering Senate, House, and state-level campaigns.\n\n\n\nQ: How should news organizations follow up their breaking news coverage of the near-miss assassination attempt against former President Trump? Is there a risk of overplaying the threat of political violence? Or understating it?\n\nPatterson: Political assassinations and near-misses are relatively rare in American politics and don\u2019t fit a clear pattern. Some would-be assassins have been true believers, others have been loners or unhinged, and others have borne a personal grudge. We haven\u2019t had a case of a copy-cat assassin, which might be the only risk to life of overplaying the latest one.\n\n\n\nQ: There was intense coverage of whether President Biden should remain in the race\u2014sometimes breathless minute-by-minute analysis of polls. Was this horse race coverage warranted so far ahead of the voting? And did Donald Trump escape similar scrutiny about his age and health?\n\nGibbs: I share many people\u2019s concerns about journalists relying too heavily on polls and horse race coverage at the expense of deep reporting into the stakes and the policy implications of competing campaigns. But in this case, the coverage reflected concerns that voters had been sharing literally for years; Biden\u2019s age was a constant subject of concern even among voters who strongly supported his policies. If anything, the coverage ran behind public opinion rather than ahead of it. And while Trump\u2019s disapproval ratings have been consistently high, his age was not at the top of the list of concerns, compared with his lawlessness, his callousness, or his bigotry.\n\n\n\nQ: With Kamala Harris suddenly all but ordained as the Democratic frontrunner after Biden\u2019s withdrawal, how should reporters measure her candidacy and her campaign?",

        "text": "Young Black voters might be swing voters now\nBefore President Joe Biden exited the presidential race on July 21, pollsters had noticed a consistent trend: Black voters were less solidly in the Democratic camp than in recent elections, including 2020. The Republican Party took notice: During the Republican National Convention, speakers like Rep. John James and Madeline Brame made special efforts to appeal to this key constituency.\n\nBlack voters are at least 10 percent of the population in several of the states most likely to decide the 2024 election \u2014 from Pennsylvania to Michigan to Florida. They also loom large in Georgia and North Carolina, states that have been close in the recent past. So even small changes in Black Americans' support for Democrats could take key states off the table.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris's candidacy has the potential to win back Black voters who shifted away from Democrats when Biden was the nominee. But who exactly are these potential new Black swing voters? That's a hard question to answer, in part because polls are rarely optimized to target a demographic that is diverse and larger than the entire population of Canada. By comparing high-quality polls from 2008 to 2024, though, we can see that age has emerged as a major factor in Black voters' support for Democrats \u2014 with younger Black voters no longer as solidly in Democrats' camp.\n\nHow much Black support had Biden lost?\n\nIt's unsurprising that the first Black president, Barack Obama, won more than 90 percent of Black voters during his own reelection bid in 2012 and enjoyed strong Black turnout, too. So, to get a baseline of Black voters' support for a white Democrat before former President Donald Trump came on the scene, we've got to look back to the 2008 primaries, when then-Sen. Hillary Clinton was one of the front-runners for the Democratic nomination.\n\nThat spring, before the nomination was set, the polling firm Knowledge Networks used population-based methods \u2014 surveying respondents online after recruiting them offline \u2014 to conduct a panel survey for the National Annenberg Election Survey. With a sample size of 9,888 in its spring 2008 wave alone, this survey had a large sample (962) of Black respondents. Overall, 75 percent of Black adults said they would vote for Clinton in a hypothetical general election matchup with then-Sen. John McCain, who got only 8 percent among Black adults. That's a 67-percentage-point gap.\n\nIn early 2024, however, the numbers looked quite different. Political scientist Gall Sigler and I partnered with NORC in February and March of this year to conduct a survey of the 2024 election that included 834 Black adults, and we found Biden led among these respondents by a smaller margin of 61 percent to 20 percent \u2014 a gap of only 41 points. (That wasn't far off a March/April YouGov poll of 2,004 Black or African American respondents conducted as part of the National Black Voter Project, which found Biden up 62 percent to 15 percent.) To be sure, that was still a massive pro-Democratic lean. But it was less than Democrats have enjoyed in the recent past.\n\nYounger Black Americans may now be swing voters\n\nWhat changed between 2008 and 2024? A look at Black support by age reveals the answer. As you can see in the chart below, in 2008, Black support for Clinton and McCain was reasonably consistent across age groups. Clinton's support was between 67 and 84 percent among Black Americans across all age categories.\n\nBut by 2024, a clear age gap had opened up among Black Americans, at least when thinking about a Biden-Trump matchup. Older Black voters remained overwhelmingly Democratic: For example, Black respondents aged 65-74 supported Biden by 70 points. But as you can see in the next chart, younger Black voters favored Biden by much smaller margins. In fact, Black voters between 25 and 34 gave just about equal support to Biden and Trump.\n\nWhy were younger Black Americans less supportive of Biden?\n\nOf course, it's possible that the key factor wasn't age itself, but rather something correlated with age, like propensity to turn out to vote. Back in April, using the same data set, I found that Trump performed much better \u2014 and Biden much worse \u2014 among Black voters who turned out less frequently. Biden's margin over Trump was 81 points among Black voters who voted in 2018, 2020 and 2022, while it was only 10 points among those who voted in none of those three elections.\n\nYounger voters tend to turn out less consistently, so maybe Biden's underperformance with young voters was really a weakness with infrequent voters. But vote history wasn't the whole story. When we fit a linear regression model to account for the relationship between prior turnout and voter preference simultaneously, age-based differences in voter preference among Black voters were reduced but not eliminated.\n\nAnother factor could have been Black voters' personal experiences with politics. In theory, Black voters who were young adults during the civil-rights era might be especially loyal to the Democratic Party because of the party's role in passing landmark legislation like the 1965 Voting Rights Act when they were most impressionable. But if that were true, we might expect to see a discontinuity for people in their late 70s, since someone who is 77 today was 18 in 1965. Instead, the actual trend by age groups looked more like a straight line, suggesting that other processes were at work.\n\nIndeed, there are other factors that also vary with age and might explain the age gap we saw. Thirty years ago, political scientist Michael Dawson published the book \"Behind the Mule,\" which argued that Black voters are an unusually cohesive voting bloc because of something called \"linked fate.\" To an important extent, Dawson wrote, Black Americans see their own opportunities as tethered to those of the Black community, so they vote overwhelmingly for the party they see as best for that community.\n\nIn the early 2024 survey, we measured this idea partly by asking Black respondents, \"Do you think what happens generally to Black people in this country will have something to do with what happens in your life, or not?\" Overall, our respondents tended to agree, with 75 percent saying what happens generally to Black people has \"a lot\" or \"some\" to do with their own life. But there was an age gap here too, albeit a more modest one: Black respondents aged 55-64 reported the highest sense of linked fate (79 percent), while those who were 18-24 reported the lowest (60 percent). It's plausible, then, that weaker perceptions of linked fate among younger Black voters helps explain the age gap in presidential support.\n\nBut let's be precise about the magnitude of the relationship. As respondents shifted from the lowest sense of linked fate (\"not at all\") to the highest (\"a lot\"), their support for Biden increased by about 0.11 on a 0-1 scale, according to a linear regression model. So linked fate was a part of the explanation, but it was not the whole story either. Even when we accounted for linked fate in statistical models, the age gap remained meaningful.*\n\nWhat this means for the fall campaign\n\nFor years, Democratic campaigns have devoted a lot of time and energy specifically to mobilizing Black voters. That will surely also be the case this year since, even if the Biden-level performance holds, Democrats will still benefit from high Black turnout \u2014 but some quick math shows us that those benefits may be dampened compared to prior years.\n\nIf Black voters as a whole cast more than 90 percent of their ballots for the Democrats, turning out 100 new Black voters will result in a net gain of 80 Democratic votes \u2014 that's assuming, though, a very high margin of Democratic victory among Black voters, and that the Black voters who only vote occasionally have the same levels of support as those who vote consistently. But if Black voters who wouldn't have otherwise voted are only with the Democrats by a margin of, say, 47 percent to 29 percent, turning out 100 new Black voters produces just 18 votes for Democrats on average. So if Democrats are losing the support of younger Black voters or less engaged Black voters, they may find that their get-out-the-vote efforts don't bear the same fruit as in past years.\n\nSophia Leung and Gall Sigler contributed research.\n\nFootnotes\n\n*In these regression models, we also saw that women were about 0.07 points (on the same 0-1 scale) more pro-Biden and that neither income nor education was a strong predictor of Black respondents' presidential preference.",

If fewer than six went against it, it would win.\n\nThe keys assess various factors, including economic performance, social stability, and incumbent charisma. Through careful analysis spanning historical data since former US president Abraham Lincoln's era, Lichtman has crafted a predictive model that transcends conventional methods used by traditional psephologists.\n\nAllan Lichtman's \"13 Keys To The White House\"\n\nFrom Ronald Reagan's re-election triumph amid economic recession to Bill Clinton's victory against George HW Bush, Allan Lichtman has correctly predicted crucial poll contests in the US.\n\nThe 13 keys to the White House as designed by him are as follows:\n\nParty Mandate: Post-midterm elections, the incumbent party secures more US House of Representatives seats than in the previous midterms.\n\nNomination Contest: There's no significant challenge to the incumbent party's nomination.\n\nIncumbency: The sitting president represents the incumbent party.\n\nThird-party Factor: There's no noteworthy third-party or independent campaign.\n\nShort-term Economic Stability: The economy doesn't face recession during the election period.\n\nLong-term Economic Growth: Real per capita economic growth equals or surpasses the average growth of the preceding two terms.\n\nPolicy Shift: The incumbent administration enacts major alterations in national policy.\n\nSocial Stability: There's no prolonged social unrest throughout the term.\n\nScandal-Free: The incumbent administration remains free from major scandals.\n\nForeign/Military Mishaps: No significant failures occur in foreign or military affairs under the incumbent administration.\n\nForeign/Military Triumphs: The incumbent administration achieves significant successes in foreign or military matters.\n\nIncumbent Charm: The incumbent party's candidate possesses charisma or enjoys national hero status.\n\nChallenger Appeal: The opposing party's candidate lacks charisma or national hero status.\n\nDonald Trump Or Kamala Harris, Who Will Win US Polls?\n\nAllan Lichtman currently favours US Vice-President and Democrat Kamala Harris over her Republican rival Donald Trump. He told News Nation that he believes \"a lot would have to go wrong for Harris to lose.\"\n\nDemocrats, with Harris being the likely nominee after Joe Biden quit the reelection race, currently hold six of the 13 keys, according to his prediction. These include a primary contest, short-term economy, long-term economy, policy change, no scandal, and no challenger charisma.\n\n\"Right now, Democrats have lost three keys\" by switching to Harris, he told News Nation.\n\nHe said Democrats lost the \"party mandate\" key due to big losses in the 2022 mid-term elections. He also said Harris has lost the \"charisma\" and \"incumbency\" keys.\n\nI plan to make my official prediction in August after the Democratic convention.\n\nSee my assessment below below on the 13 Keys Tracker on where The Keys stand NOW. Please listen to our LIVE show on 7\u201325\u201324, linked in the comments below, where we detail every Key. pic.twitter.com/pJpkpa3SzW \u2014 Allan Lichtman (@AllanLichtman) July 26, 2024\n\nUnder his prediction model, Democrats, however, would have to lose three more keys in order for him to predict a Harris loss. But he says that's not likely to happen.\n\nHe has said that he plans to make his official prediction for the 2024 White House race after the Democratic convention in August.",

How are you going to resolve this dispute? Present the minutes. If the minutes reveal discrepancies between the opposition and the government, the opposition can file an appeal and wait for the courts to handle it. We will then have to follow the court's decision,\u201d the president said.\n\nHe described the situation in the neighboring country as normal. \u201cI'm convinced that it\u2019s a standard, orderly process. People who disagree should have the right to express their views and challenge the results, while the government has the right to defend its position,\u201d Lula added.\n\nVenezuela's National Electoral Council (CNE) has yet to release the official minutes to validate the election results, which reportedly gave Maduro a victory with 51.21 percent of the votes compared to 44 percent for Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez, according to CNE.\n\nPart of the opposition, along with some countries and organs like the Organization of American States (OAS), are questioning the fairness of the election and demanding the release of the minutes for a proper audit of the votes. In response, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's government accuses certain opposition figures and foreign nations of inciting an alleged coup d'\u00e9tat against the electoral results.\n\nConversation with Biden\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon (30), Lula and US President Joe Biden discussed the situation in Venezuela on the phone following the presidential elections on Sunday (29). Both leaders emphasized the importance of publishing the electoral records.\n\nIn a statement, the White House said President Biden thanked Lula for his regional leadership regarding the Venezuela situation. The two leaders also agreed on the urgent need for Venezuelan electoral authorities to release comprehensive, transparent, and detailed electoral data from polling stations.\n\n\u201cThe two leaders agreed that the outcome of the Venezuelan elections is a critical moment for democracy in the hemisphere and committed to staying closely coordinated on the issue,\u201d the statement read.",

You won\u2019t have to do it anymore. \u2026 You got to get out and vote. In four years, you don\u2019t have to vote again. We\u2019ll have it fixed so good you\u2019re not going to have to vote.\n\nDemocrats pounced on this as evidence of Trump\u2019s dictatorial ambitions. But not all conservative Christians were thrilled about it, either.\n\nDavid Lane, who leads an organisation dedicated to getting Christian leaders elected, fretted that Trump\u2019s comments could discourage Christians from voting in the future.\n\n\u201cEvangelicals in 2028, 2032, and 2036 must raise their civics game to a new level if America is to return to the Judeo-Christian heritage and Biblical-based culture laid out by the founders\u201d, Lane told the Washington Post.\n\nWas Trump really promising dictatorship? Or claiming there would be no need for Christians to vote in future elections? Or was he just repeating a joke he made a week earlier, based on his (wildly inaccurate) belief that conservative Christians are reluctant voters?\n\nEven jokes can be revealing, especially when it comes to the relationship between Trump and his supporters. Trump was not saying he would end elections, but he was being coyly apocalyptic about what Christians could expect from this one.",

        "text": "Assessing the Results of Venezuela\u2019s Presidential Election\nAntony J. Blinken, Secretary of State\n\nAugust 1, 2024\n\nThe United States applauds the Venezuelan people for their participation in the July 28 presidential election despite significant challenges. At least 12 million Venezuelans peacefully went to the polls and exercised one of the most powerful rights given to people in any democracy: the right to vote. Unfortunately, the processing of those votes and the announcement of results by the Maduro-controlled National Electoral Council (CNE) were deeply flawed, yielding an announced outcome that does not represent the will of the Venezuelan people.\n\nThe CNE\u2019s rapid declaration of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro as the winner of the presidential election came with no supporting evidence. The CNE still has not published disaggregated data or any of the vote tally sheets, despite repeated calls from Venezuelans and the international community to do so. As the independent Carter Center\u2019s observation mission reported, the CNE\u2019s failure to provide the precinct-level official results, as well as irregularities throughout the process, have stripped the CNE\u2019s announced outcome of any credibility.\n\nMeanwhile, the democratic opposition has published more than 80 percent of the tally sheets received directly from polling stations throughout Venezuela. Those tally sheets indicate that Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia received the most votes in this election by an insurmountable margin. Independent observers have corroborated these facts, and this outcome was also supported by election day exit polls and quick counts. In the days since the election, we have consulted widely with partners and allies around the world, and while countries have taken different approaches in responding, none have concluded that Nicol\u00e1s Maduro received the most votes this election.\n\nGiven the overwhelming evidence, it is clear to the United States and, most importantly, to the Venezuelan people that Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia won the most votes in Venezuela\u2019s July 28 presidential election.\n\nIn addition, the United States rejects Maduro\u2019s unsubstantiated allegations against opposition leaders. Maduro and his representatives\u2019 threats to arrest opposition leaders, including Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez and Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, are an undemocratic attempt to repress political participation and retain power. The safety and security of the democratic opposition leaders and members must be protected. All Venezuelans arrested while peacefully exercising their right to participate in the electoral process or demand transparency in the tabulation and announcement of results should be released immediately. Law enforcement and security forces should not become an instrument of political violence used against citizens exercising their democratic rights.\n\nWe congratulate Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia on his successful campaign. Now is the time for the Venezuelan parties to begin discussions on a respectful, peaceful transition in accordance with Venezuelan electoral law and the wishes of the Venezuelan people. We fully support the process of re-establishing democratic norms in Venezuela and stand ready to consider ways to bolster it jointly with our international partners.",

        "text": "Trump and Vance\u2019s misogyny and cynical identity politics mean Australians can\u2019t \u2018just chill\u2019 about the US election | Paul Daley\nThe forthcoming election is one of the most important to me since I first cast a ballot more than four decades ago. And yet this time \u2013 while I\u2019ve never felt more invested in an election\u2019s outcome \u2013 I won\u2019t have a vote.\n\nI\u2019m not talking about the next federal poll in Australia \u2013 the one that\u2019s most likely to be held early next year. No, I\u2019m referring to the United States presidential election in November, the result of which will reverberate with profound global consequences and \u2013 therefore \u2013 with significant personal others as well.\n\nYes, I\u2019ve heard our ambassador to the US, Kevin Rudd, praise Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cdiscipline\u2019\u2019 and tell people to \u201cjust chill\u2019\u2019 because \u201cwe\u2019re not going over some chasm\u2019\u2019 if the 45th president \u2013 a narcissist and misogynist with a chaotic vision (or hallucination; it\u2019s hard to tell) \u2013 is elected the 47th. And I\u2019ve heard the rote, condescending nonsense \u2013 equally aimed to assuage the fears of the decent and progressive \u2013 from Australian politicians: that the US-Australia relationship exists between two \u201cgreat democracies\u2019\u2019 and that it is effectively immaterial who the next president ... blah blah.\n\nBut I did also hear another, rather more convincing, non-ambassadorial version of Rudd say Trump was \u201cnuts\u201d (mild criticism, really, given the array of damning material in the ether about the Republican presidential nominee). Just as it resonated when the Republican veep nominee, JD Vance, called his running mate \u201ccultural heroin\u2019\u2019 and \u201cAmerica\u2019s Hitler\u201d. In fairness, that was in the not-so-distant past (according to him, another country) when Vance had a book to sell and before he decided that he\u2019d like to follow Trump all the way into the Oval Office.\n\nIndeed, there seems to be a bottomless well of character assessments (\u201cmorally reprehensible human being\u2019\u2019 \u2013 again, hard to argue!) Vance gave Trump in the unforgiving continent that is the past.\n\nMy obsession with what happens next in the US \u2013 and my sense of powerlessness to change it \u2013 is manifesting in personally unprecedented engagement with US news, commentary media and polls. This fixation is doubtless related to advancing middle age, legacy and a future (without me in it) that will still be inhabited by my children and grandchildren.\n\nAmerica is the most geopolitically and militarily influential of countries. It is also the west\u2019s most culturally and socially impactful. It\u2019s why I fear for my \u2013 and everyone else\u2019s \u2013 descendants (not least women and girls like my daughters and granddaughters) in a world whose the two potentially most-powerful men \u2013 Trump and Vance \u2013 are also so apparently misogynistic, hateful and narcissistic.\n\nThe litany of Trump\u2019s actual (and verbal) offences against women is notorious. This seems too often forgotten or overlooked by admirers the world over \u2013 especially among sections of the political class here in Australia \u2013 to the file marked \u201ccharacter\u2019\u2019 and made, therefore, somehow irrelevant.\n\nBut such character traits are as highly relevant globally, as Trump attacks the reproductive (and human) rights of American women and deploys vicious slurs against women who threaten \u2013 or call out \u2013 their misogyny. The latest to come to light seems to be Vance\u2019s weaponisation of parenthood, in 2021 labelling senior Democrats \u2013 including now presidential nominee Kamala Harris and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez \u2013 \u201cchildless cat ladies\u2019\u2019.\n\nTrump\u2019s latest attack on Kamala Harris \u2013 saying she had \u201cturned black\u2019\u2019, an unsustainably false challenge to her racial identity \u2013 makes him less worthy. Just as this will give succour to racists the world over, it also enables politicians, including here, who would weaponise racial identity for cynical gain.\n\nWhile Trump and Vance, like all populists, are perilously short on constructive policy and plans and optimism for the future, their prescriptive visions for social design when it comes to families and how they reckon they should look are coming into very sharp \u2013 and alarming \u2013 focus.\n\nIf this is all starting to sound, well, somewhat dystopic, that\u2019s because it is. The most alarming thing for me, a world away, about the re-emergence of Trump (twice impeached, 34 felony convictions) and the upwardly-managing Vance is the global licence they give others to ape, voice and enact their misogyny. If it\u2019s good enough for the leader of the free world and his apprentice ...\n\nWith Trump\u2019s cozying up to despots and dictators and his own dictatorial fantasies (having denied the last election result then incited a 6 January lynch mob to attack the capitol in pursuit of his then vice-president, Mike Pence, who certified the legitimate election of Joe Biden), Trump is the embodiment of autocracy. The danger he poses potentially extends far and away beyond the US, and with a deputy like Vance (who would not stand up to him the way Pence did), Trump\u2019s power would be unfettered. So, \u201cresponsible\u2019\u2019? No. Don\u2019t just chill. Be vigilant.\n\nI could go on about how Trump\u2019s general playbook and cynical identity politics has already influenced and enabled elements of Australian leadership (as it has elsewhere in the world) from the tenor of civic debate to renewables (\u201cdrill baby drill\u2019\u2019), emissions targets and a range of social issues. But it is the Trump/Vance attitude \u2013 their words and actions regarding women, gender, families, race and society \u2013 that makes the forthcoming presidential election the most consequential for the rest of my life.\n\nIt\u2019s true we don\u2019t have a vote down here. But as many have said, maybe we should. Meanwhile, some of us can continue to hope and watch carefully.",

(Erin Schaff/Pool/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has launched her bid for the 2024 Democratic presidential nomination. While most U.S. vice presidents in recent decades have sought the presidency, relatively few of them have won.\n\nHow we did this Kamala Harris\u2019 announcement that she would run for president made us wonder how many vice presidents in the United States have ultimately gone on to become president. We conducted this analysis to look at past vice presidents who ran for the top job and how often they won. For this analysis, we consulted historical records from the White House Historical Association, the U.S. House and Senate, presidential libraries and the University of Virginia\u2019s Miller Center, as well as news reports.\n\nOverall, 29 of the 49 people who have served as vice president since the country\u2019s founding have gone on to formally seek a party\u2019s presidential nomination, either immediately after leaving the vice presidency or in the years that followed. Ten of these 29 vice presidents \u2013 about a third \u2013 have been elected to the nation\u2019s top political office.\n\nUntil the 1930s, it was less common for the vice president to seek the presidency. Many returned to a lower elected office or retired after serving as vice president. Still, earlier well-known presidents including John Adams, Thomas Jefferson and Theodore Roosevelt had previously served as vice president.\n\nAmong modern vice presidents, running for the top job has become more of the norm. Starting with Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s first term in 1933, 15 of 18 vice presidents have launched presidential campaigns of their own after serving in the deputy role. But only five of these 15 emerged victorious: Democrats Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson and Joe Biden, and Republicans Richard Nixon and George H.W. Bush.\n\nTwo of these five modern vice presidents-turned-presidents initially took office after incumbent presidents died and they subsequently ran for election at the top of the ticket:\n\nHarry Truman had been vice president for less than three months when FDR died in office in 1945, elevating Truman to the Oval Office. Truman went on to be elected president in 1948.\n\n\n\n\n\nhad been vice president for less than three months when FDR died in office in 1945, elevating Truman to the Oval Office. Truman went on to be elected president in 1948. Lyndon Johnson took over after President John F. Kennedy\u2019s 1963 assassination. Johnson was elected for a full, four-year term in 1964.\n\nTwo others weren\u2019t elected to the top office until years after their vice presidencies ended:\n\nIn 1960, Richard Nixon \u2013 who was serving as Dwight Eisenhower\u2019s second-in-command \u2013 lost the presidency to Kennedy in a close contest. He would run again, and win, in a 1968 match against then-Vice President Hubert Humphrey, a Democrat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2013 who was serving as Dwight Eisenhower\u2019s second-in-command \u2013 lost the presidency to Kennedy in a close contest. He would run again, and win, in a 1968 match against then-Vice President Hubert Humphrey, a Democrat. Joe Biden, former vice president to Barack Obama, decided not to seek the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016. He went on to run and win in 2020.\n\nThree modern vice presidents have won their party\u2019s nomination but lost the general election. In 1948, FDR\u2019s third-term vice president, Henry Wallace, was the Progressive Party nominee. Jimmy Carter\u2019s vice president, Walter Mondale, secured the 1984 Democratic nomination. And in 2000, Al Gore, Bill Clinton\u2019s second-in-command, was the Democratic nominee. Gore won the popular vote but lost in the Electoral College and conceded to George W. Bush.\n\nMany of the 15 modern vice presidents who have run for president haven\u2019t been able to secure a major party nomination:",

No other major opponent emerged to challenge her for the nomination.\n\nHarris won the support of 99% of the delegates who signed petitions in the party's nominating contest, the Democratic National Committee said in a statement, while no one else met the qualifying threshold of 300 signatures.\n\n\"Our delegates have an important responsibility \u2014 and opportunity \u2014 in the days ahead to cast their history-making ballots for Vice President Harris, ensuring that she will be on the ballot in every state this November,\" said Jaime Harrison, the national party chair.\n\n\"Our party has met this unprecedented moment with a transparent, democratic and orderly process to unite behind a nominee with a proven record who will lead us in the fight ahead,\" he said.\n\nHarris will become the first Black and South Asian woman to ever secure a major U.S. party's presidential nomination.\n\nWith the November 5 election less than 100 days away, polling across the U.S. and in key states shows Harris and Trump locked in a closely contested race.",

        "text": "How the 2024 election will affect the automotive industry: Presidential candidate\u2019s potential impact\nThe outcome of the 2024 presidential election could significantly shape the industry\u2019s future, influencing everything from environmental regulations to trade policies and technological advancements. Here, we explore the potential implications of each presidential candidate on the automotive sector.\n\nDemocratic Candidate Kamala Harris\n\nKamala Harris, now the presumptive Democratic nominee, has a strong track record of supporting environmental initiatives and advancing technology in the automotive sector. Her agenda is expected to build on the foundation laid by the Biden administration, with an even more aggressive push toward sustainability and innovation.\n\nHarris has emphasized the importance of supporting electric vehicles (EV) production and adoption. Her administration would likely push for stricter fuel economy standards and offer substantial incentives for EV production. This includes expanding the nearly $1.1 billion in grants planned for General Motors (GM) and Stellantis to convert existing plants for EV and component production.\n\nMoreover, Harris\u2019s focus on infrastructure would see an increase in investments in nationwide EV charging networks. This effort aims to alleviate range anxiety and encourage more consumers to switch to electric vehicles. Tax credits and incentives for consumers purchasing EVs would likely be expanded, making them more financially accessible to the average American.\n\nHarris\u2019s policies also emphasize the need to support American workers in transitioning to green technologies. Initiatives to retrain workers from traditional automotive manufacturing sectors to new roles in EV production will be crucial in her plan to achieve a carbon-neutral economy by 2050. These measures would accelerate the shift towards sustainable transportation, positioning the U.S. as a global leader in the fight against climate change.\n\nRepublican Candidate Donald Trump\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is a vocal critic of stringent environmental regulations, often advocating for deregulation to boost economic growth. His first term saw significant efforts to roll back numerous ecological protections to reduce the regulatory burden on businesses and foster economic expansion. A Trump administration could roll back many of the current emission standards and fuel economy requirements. Trump has repeatedly vowed to repeal what he calls Biden\u2019s \u201cEV mandate,\u201d referring to a new EPA regulation limiting tailpipe pollution.\n\nTrump\u2019s approach to the automotive industry emphasizes the importance of bolstering domestic manufacturing. He has advocated for tariffs and trade policies to protect U.S. automakers from foreign competition. By imposing tariffs on imported vehicles and parts, Trump aims to encourage the production of cars within the United States, thereby creating jobs and supporting the domestic economy. However, these policies could also increase production costs for automakers, as they might have to pay more for imported components or shift their supply chains domestically.\n\nFurthermore, Trump\u2019s trade policies could exacerbate trade tensions with key automotive markets, such as China and the European Union. These tensions might result in retaliatory tariffs, affecting the export of American-made vehicles and parts. This complex trade environment could pose challenges for U.S. automakers, who rely on global supply chains and international markets for their products.\n\nWhile Trump\u2019s policies may provide short-term economic benefits for domestic manufacturers, they could also lead to higher production costs and strained international trade relationships. The potential rollback of environmental regulations might offer temporary relief for traditional automotive sectors but could hinder long-term innovation and the global shift toward sustainable transportation.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe 2024 presidential election presents a critical moment for the automotive industry. Each candidate brings a distinct vision that could accelerate the transition towards sustainable transportation or favor traditional manufacturing practices. As voters decide, the automotive sector must stay adaptable and prepared for potential policy shifts.",

Getty Images\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, drew gasps on Wednesday when he said at the National Association of Black Journalists convention that Vice President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic nominee, had suddenly adopted a Black identity.\n\nHarris\u2019 father is from Jamaica, her late mother from India. Trump claimed: \u201cI\u2019ve known her a long time, indirectly, not directly very much, and she was always of Indian heritage, and she was only promoting Indian heritage. I didn\u2019t know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black, and now she wants to be known as Black. So I don\u2019t know, is she Indian, or is she Black?\u201d\n\nWhen one of the journalists who was interviewing Trump on stage tried to tell him that Harris had always identified as Black and had attended a historically Black university, Trump continued: \u201cI respect either one, but she obviously doesn\u2019t. Because she was Indian all the way, and then all of a sudden, she made a turn, and she went \u2013 she became a Black person. And I think somebody should look into that too.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s comments prompted immediate bipartisan criticism. Leaving aside the issue of the appropriateness of the remarks, his claims are just not true.\n\nFacts First: Trump\u2019s claims are false. Harris did not \u201call of a sudden\u201d begin identifying as Black. She has embraced and discussed her Black identity for decades, beginning long before she became a political candidate, while also honoring her South Asian heritage.\n\nHarris graduated in 1986 from Howard University, a historically Black institution where she was a member of a historically Black sorority. After that, she was elected president of the association of Black law students in her second year at the University of California, Hastings College of the Law, according to her 2019 memoir.\n\nPolitico reported in 2021 that, as a third-year student at the law school in 1989, Harris rose to speak against anti-Black racism at a campus demonstration prompted by the discovery of racist vandalism: \u201cFor Black students, she said, according to archives of the Hastings Law News, the cartoon was an example of \u2018what we deal with all the time.\u2019\u201d\n\nA profile of Harris in the publication AsianWeek in 2003, when she was running for San Francisco district attorney, was focused on her South Asian heritage. But it quoted Harris discussing her father as \u201ca Black man\u201d and saying, \u201cI grew up with a strong Indian culture, and I was raised in a Black community. All my friends were Black, and we got together and cooked Indian food and painted henna on our hands, and I never felt uncomfortable with my cultural background.\u201d\n\nRead more about why Trump\u2019s claim about Harris\u2019 was false and several other false statements he made at the conference here.",

        "text": "Could the gender divide decide the US presidential election?\nThe 2024 presidential election \"pits young men against young women,\" said The Wall Street Journal . Voters under 30 are increasingly divided along gender lines, with women favoring Democrats and men increasingly favoring Republicans. That gap isn't just about candidates: It extends to \"abortion, student-loan forgiveness and other issues\" of concern to young adults. Some of that might reflect different life experiences: A growing share of young women are achieving financial independence, \"while fewer young men are reaching that milestone compared with four decades ago.\"\n\nIt's not just young people. There's also a \"divorce divide\" in American politics, Daniel A. Cox said at the Survey Center on American Life . Recent polling shows that 56% of divorced men are voting for Donald Trump \u2014 his most devoted group of voters \u2014 compared to 42% of divorced women. That's a sign that as Americans \"spend more time uncoupled, they are more likely to develop a tribal approach to politics.\" And there are concerns the gender gap could ripple more broadly through American culture. \"Partisan polarization is bad for the nation,\" Elizabeth Grace Matthew said at The Hill, \"but partisan polarization that correlates ever more with sex is likely to prove even worse.\"\n\n\"The gender war is much weirder than it initially appears,\" Derek Thompson said at The Atlantic. It might appear that men are shifting right and women to the left, but \"it's not so simple.\" Millions of women will vote for Donald Trump this year, after all. But Republicans and Democrats are \"sharply divided by their cultural attitudes toward gender roles and the experience of being a man or woman in America.\" For example: One survey found that 61% of Democrats think women face discrimination, while only 19% of Republicans agree. The gap isn't about gender \u2014 it's about \"the role of gender, the meaning of gender, the definition of gender.\"\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Yes, women are usually more liberal than men, but the size of the gap \"just isn't all that big.\" \"The differences between women and men are not, in any way, the biggest differences we have in American politics,\" said the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee's Kathleen Dolan. Maybe that is changing for younger generations, but for now the \"narrative is galloping well ahead of the facts.\"\n\nWhat next?\n\nThe gap is an international phenomenon. \"In countries on every continent, an ideological gap has opened up between young men and women,\" John Burn-Murdoch said at the Financial Times. There are growing divides between \"increasingly conservative young men and progressive female contemporaries.\" That could shape politics around the world for decades to come, not just in the current U.S. election. \"The ideology gaps are only growing, and data shows that people's formative political experiences are hard to shake off.\"\n\nBack in the U.S., the gender gap seems to be widening with Kamala Harris' ascension to the top of the ticket, said NBC News. Recent polls show Harris with a 14- to 16-point lead over Trump among women voters, while Trump beats Harris by as much as 24 points among men. Bottom line: \"Trump's advantage among men seems larger than Harris' edge among women.\" That means the divide could be a \"significant factor\" in the 2024 race.",

Outsourcing is projected to reach $75.89 trillion by 2027; however, such drastic changes in the U.S., the largest offshoring market, will likely affect the global economy.\n\nAbout 66% of U.S. companies outsource at least one business function, leading to around 300,000 U.S. jobs being contracted out every year. In addition, the U.S. generates the most revenue in the global business process outsourcing (BPO) industry, with a projected income of $146.30 billion in 2024.\n\nIf Trump wins the election and bans offshoring, it will severely affect service provider countries once businesses pull out. The top countries that U.S. companies outsource to include India, China, Mexico, Brazil, Poland, and the Philippines.\n\nAs the leading country for outsourcing, India\u2019s multibillion-dollar industry relies heavily on its clients in the U.S. While China takes most of the manufacturing jobs, the Philippines remains the BPO capital. Outsourcing to the Philippines covers 13% of the global market while contributing around $30 billion to the country\u2019s annual revenue.",

He said that while Trump surviving an assassination attempt should have sealed the win for him, the incident has only been \u201cmemory holed.\u201d\n\n\u2018It's a terrifying thought\u2019\n\nX users weighed in on Rogan\u2019s comments, with one user commenting on the above video, \u201cI wouldn't be surprised if Kamala wins.

        "text": "What the presidential election could mean for Social Security and Medicare\nA voter fills out a ballot at a polling station on Election Day in Falls Church, Virginia, U.S., November 7, 2023. Kevin Lamarque | Reuters\n\nWhen it comes to the November election, there is one issue that is at the top of voters' wish lists: Social Security. Despite political division, most Americans \u2014 87% \u2014 want action to address Social Security's trust fund shortfall, according to the National Institute on Retirement Security. The group polled 1,208 individuals aged 25 and older. Meanwhile, 69% of Americans said a candidate's stance on Social Security will be a major factor in how they vote in the presidential election, according to Nationwide Retirement Institute. It polled 1,831 adults age 18 and up who \"currently receive or expect to receive Social Security.\" While experts mostly agree a fix is needed, they are divided on how that should happen \u2014 whether it be through tax increases, benefit cuts or a combination of both. The deadline to fix the programs will only grow more urgent during the next presidential administration. \"If something is going to happen before the eleventh hour, it is going to require presidential leadership,\" said Emerson Sprick, associate director of the Bipartisan Policy Center's Economic Policy Program. \"That's something we haven't seen on this issue for a very long time.\"\n\nProjected depletion dates are looming\n\nBiden can 'show leadership' before presidency ends\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden is flanked by family members as he speaks about the release of Americans detained in Russia during brief remarks at the White House in Washington, U.S., August 1, 2024. Nathan Howard | Reuters\n\nWhile the focus is on the presidential campaigns, President Joe Biden still has a window of opportunity to work to address Social Security and Medicare. \"Biden has a really fantastic opportunity, if he wants to get the ball rolling and show some leadership on the issue in the lame duck,\" Sprick said. Some Democrats have proposed raising taxes for the wealthy and increasing benefits. Meanwhile, a bipartisan group of lawmakers has proposed forming a commission to identify next steps. But those efforts like those have yet to prompt action, which would likely require compromises. \"The folks in Congress need leadership and a little bit of cover from the top of the ticket,\" Sprick said. Biden publicly vowed to protect Social Security and Medicare and \"make the wealthy pay their fair share\" during his March State of the Union address. \"We could extend the life of Medicare's Trust Fund permanently \u2014 without cutting benefits \u2014 if Congressional Republicans would get on board with the President's historic budget proposal to raise taxes on the wealthy,\" said White House spokesperson Robyn Patterson. \"The President's budget also clearly states his principles for strengthening Social Security,\" Patterson said. \"He looks forward to working with Congress to responsibly strengthen Social Security by ensuring that high-income individuals pay their fair share, without increasing taxes on anyone making less than $400,000 or cutting benefits.\"\n\nTrump wants to eliminate some Social Security taxes\n\nRepublican presidential nominee and former U.S. President Donald Trump holds a campaign rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, U.S., July 31, 2024. Elizabeth Frantz | Reuters\n\nFormer President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social on Thursday, in all capital letters, \"Seniors should not pay tax on Social Security!\" Experts say the post likely refers to the taxes Social Security beneficiaries may owe on their benefit income. The Trump campaign did not return a request for comment by press time. Exactly how much Social Security beneficiaries pay in taxes is based on their \"combined income,\" which includes adjusted gross income, nontaxable interest and half of their Social Security benefits. For individuals with $25,000 to $34,000 in combined income \u2014 or married couples who file jointly with between $32,000 and $44,000 \u2014 up to 50% of benefits are taxed. For individuals with more than $34,000 in combined income \u2014 or married couples with more than $44,000 \u2014 up to 85% of benefits may be taxable.\n\nwatch now\n\nThose thresholds are not adjusted for inflation. Consequently, as time passes and benefit income increases, more beneficiaries are liable for taxes on their benefits. Nixing those levies would allow beneficiaries to keep more of their benefit income. But it would also reduce revenues for both Social Security and Medicare by about $1.6 trillion to $1.8 trillion between fiscal years 2026 and 2035, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates. Like Biden, Trump has mostly promised not to cut Social Security. Yet in a March CNBC interview, Trump said he would consider cutting \"entitlements,\" which may refer to Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid. \"There is a lot you can do in terms of entitlements, in terms of cutting and in terms of also the theft and bad management of entitlements,\" Trump told CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\"\n\nHarris opposes benefit cuts\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris speaks at a campaign rally at the Georgia State Convocation Center on July 30, 2024 in Atlanta, Georgia.

        "text": "Masked assailants ransack Venezuela opposition leader\u2019s headquarters as post-election tensions mount\nLee nuestra cobertura de las elecciones venezolanas en espa\u00f1ol.\n\nCARACAS, Venezuela (AP) \u2014 A half dozen masked assailants ransacked the headquarters of Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado in the latest escalation of violence against opponents of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro following the country\u2019s disputed presidential election.\n\nThe raid occurred at around 3 a.m., Machado\u2019s party said, adding that the assailants broke down doors and hauled away valuable documents and equipment. Images published by Machado\u2019s party on social media show several walls covered in black spray paint.\n\nThe arrest comes as top officials, including Maduro himself, have threatened to arrest the opposition leader, who has gone into hiding as she seeks to rally Venezuelans to challenge last Sunday\u2019s election results.\n\nThe Biden administration has thrown its support firmly behind the opposition, recognizing last minute candidate Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez as the victor, discrediting the official results of the vote proclaiming Maduro the winner.\n\nThe U.S. announcement late Thursday followed calls from multiple governments, including close allies of Maduro, for Venezuela\u2019s electoral authorities to release precinct-level vote counts, as it has done during previous elections.\n\nThe electoral body declared Maduro the winner Monday, but the main opposition coalition revealed hours later that it had collected copies of 80% of the country\u2019s 30,000 voting tallies and that they show Gonz\u00e1lez prevailed by a more than 2-to-1 margin.\n\n\u201cGiven the overwhelming evidence, it is clear to the United States and, most importantly, to the Venezuelan people that Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia won the most votes in Venezuela\u2019s July 28 presidential election,\u201d U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement.\n\nMaduro responded with a quick admonishment: \u201cThe United States needs to keep its nose out of Venezuela!\u201d\n\nThe U.S. government announcement came amid a flurry of diplomatic efforts by Brazil, Colombia and Mexico to convince their fellow leftist to allow an impartial audit of the vote. On Thursday, the governments of the three countries issued a joint statement calling on Venezuela\u2019s electoral authorities \u201cto move forward expeditiously and publicly release\u201d detailed voting data.\n\nBut it\u2019s unclear what leverage the countries have over Maduro, who has shown little inkling to rethink his entrenched position.\n\nWhile no ally or anyone in the crucial armed forces has yet to break with Maduro over the contested elections, he faces huge obstacles righting Venezuela\u2019s economy without the legitimacy that can only come from a credible election result.\n\nVenezuela sits atop world\u2019s largest proven crude reserves and once boasted Latin America\u2019s most advanced economy, but it entered into free fall marked by 130,000% hyperinflation and widespread shortages after Maduro took the helm in 2013. More than 7.7 million Venezuelans have left the country since 2014, the largest exodus in Latin America\u2019s recent history.\n\nU.S. oil sanctions have only deepened the misery and the Biden administration \u2014 which had been easing those restrictions \u2014 is now likely to ramp them up again unless Maduro backs down and agrees to some sort of transition.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s counting on being able to wait this out and people will get tired of demonstrating,\u201d said Cynthia Arnson, a distinguished fellow at the Wilson Center, a Washington think tank. \u201cThe problem is the country is in a death spiral and there\u2019s no chance the economy will be able to recover without the legitimacy that comes from a fair election.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, after the National Electoral Council declared Maduro the winner of the election, thousands of opposition supporters took to the streets. The government said it arrested hundreds of protesters and Venezuela-based human rights organization Foro Penal said 11 people were killed. Dozens more were arrested the following day, including a former opposition candidate, Freddy Superlano.\n\nMachado \u2014 who was barred from running for president \u2014 and Gonz\u00e1lez addressed a huge rally of their supporters in the capital, Caracas, on Tuesday, but they have not been seen in public since. Later that day, the president of the National Assembly, Jorge Rodriguez, called for their arrest, describing them as criminals and fascists.\n\nOn Wednesday, Maduro asked Venezuela\u2019s highest court to conduct an audit of the election, but that request drew almost immediate criticism from foreign observers who said the court, which like most institutions is controlled by the government, lacks the independence to perform a credible review.\n\nAsked why electoral authorities have not released detailed vote counts, Maduro said the National Electoral Council has come under attack, including cyberattacks, without elaborating.\n\nIn an op-ed published Thursday in the Wall Street Journal, Machado said she is \u201chiding, fearing for my life, my freedom, and that of my fellow countrymen.\u201d She reasserted that the opposition has physical evidence that Maduro lost the election and urged the international community to intervene.\n\n\u201cWe have voted Mr. Maduro out,\u201d she wrote. \u201cNow it is up to the international community to decide whether to tolerate a demonstrably illegitimate government.\u201d\n\nMachado later posted a video on social media calling on supporters to gather Saturday across the country.\n\n___\n\nGoodman reported from Medellin, Colombia.

        "text": "Democrats begin process to nominate Harris for president: What to know\nThe party has launched virtual roll call to confirm the US vice president as the Democratic nominee to face Trump in November.\n\nThe Democratic Party has begun the process of formally nominating Kamala Harris as its candidate for the United States presidential elections, less than two weeks after the vice president officially launched her campaign.\n\nDemocratic National Convention delegates began officially selecting their nominee for president on Thursday morning in what\u2019s known as a virtual roll call.\n\nHarris, who was thrust into the presidential race last month after President Joe Biden dropped his bid for re-election, is the only candidate being considered in the roll-call vote.\n\nTypically, the roll call is held at the party\u2019s national convention, a large in-person gathering held every four years to select the Democratic presidential nominee.\n\nBut this year, Democrats have chosen to use an electronic voting system that is poised to see Harris secure the nomination before the Democratic National Convention later this month in Chicago.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about the process.\n\nHow does the roll call work exactly?\n\nThe roll call is basically a vote.\n\nNearly 4,700 delegates are selected to represent states and territories across the US. They typically cast votes at the party convention to choose the presidential nominee based on primary and caucus results.\n\nBut this year \u2014 as during the last election cycle \u2014 the delegates are voting on an online platform set up by the Democratic National Committee (DNC).\n\nOn a rolling basis, each delegate is getting a \u201cpersonalised and watermarked\u201d form to cast their vote, US media outlets have reported.\n\nTo win the nomination, Harris needs the support of at least 1,976 delegates. But her ability to clinch the nomination isn\u2019t in doubt, with The Associated Press news agency reporting last month that she had far exceeded that threshold.\n\nSince the vice president had no challengers for the nomination, the electronic voting opened on August 1, as per DNC rules.\n\nHow long will the roll call take?\n\nIt will last several days, with the vote set to close at 6pm on the US East Coast (22:00 GMT) on Monday.\n\nWhy did Democrats choose to hold a virtual vote?\n\nThe party had planned to hold a virtual roll call even before President Biden dropped out of the race amid concerns about his age and ability to serve another term in office.\n\nThat\u2019s because the state of Ohio had set an August 7 deadline to get on the presidential ballot there.\n\nThat date came well before the in-person party convention, set to start on August 19. Democrats feared Republicans could try to keep Biden out of the running if the nomination process had not been completed by the Ohio deadline.\n\nJaime Harrison, the chairman of the DNC, said in a statement in May that the virtual roll call would \u201censure that Republicans can\u2019t chip away at our democracy through incompetence or partisan tricks and that Ohioans can exercise their right to vote for the presidential candidate of their choice\u201d.\n\nWhile Ohio has since moved its registration deadline back, Democrats expressed concern that Republicans could still challenge a candidate who has not been confirmed before August 7.\n\nThat\u2019s why they continued with their plans to use the virtual roll call with Harris as the presumptive nominee.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump was officially confirmed as the Republican nominee during the party\u2019s in-person convention in July.\n\nIs this the first virtual roll call?\n\nNo. The Democratic Party held its first virtual roll call during the last presidential election, in 2020.\n\nThat year marked the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, and safety restrictions prevented thousands of delegates from convening in the same room, as they had done in the past.\n\nSo instead, the delegates broadcast from their home states, some filming outdoors near iconic sites. A representative for Alabama\u2019s delegates, for instance, spoke in front of the Edmund Pettus Bridge, a symbol of the US civil rights movement.\n\nWhat have Democrats said about the process?\n\nWhen Biden was still the party\u2019s presumptive nominee, some Democratic lawmakers in Congress had criticised the early roll call.\n\nThey questioned whether it was a tactic to force through Biden\u2019s nomination, despite increasing appeals for him to withdraw from the race.\n\nUS media outlets reported in mid-July that some Democrats on Capitol Hill circulated a letter arguing there was \u201cno legal justification\u201d for the virtual proceedings because Ohio had moved the August 7 deadline back.\n\n\u201cWe respectfully but emphatically request that you cancel any plans for an accelerated \u2018virtual roll call\u2019 and further refrain from any extraordinary procedures that could be perceived as curtailing legitimate debate,\u201d the letter read, as reported by Axios.\n\nBut with Biden\u2019s exit from the race on July 21, Democrats have coalesced around Harris and dropped their objections to the process.\n\n\u201cRemember that the DNC announced an open process,\u201d Congressman Maxwell Frost of Florida wrote on social media on July 22.\n\n\u201cJust because the VP is such a unifying candidate & getting many endorsements, doesn\u2019t mean this process isn\u2019t open. Anyone can run. When she wins our nomination, it won\u2019t be because she was anointed, it\u2019ll be because she earned it.\u201d\n\nRemember that the DNC announced an open process. Just because the VP is such a unifying candidate & getting many endorsements, doesn\u2019t mean this process isn\u2019t open. Anyone can run. When she wins our nomination, it won\u2019t be because she was anointed, it\u2019ll be because she earned it. \u2014 Maxwell Alejandro Frost (@MaxwellFrostFL) July 22, 2024\n\nWhat have Republicans said?\n\nOhio Secretary of State Frank LaRose has lambasted the Democratic National Committee for using his state\u2019s ballot deadline \u201cto justify\u201d the early roll call.\n\nIn a letter to the DNC chairman, LaRose \u2014 Ohio\u2019s chief elections officer \u2014 said he had confirmed with the state attorney general \u201cthat Ohio law does not require the DNC to conduct a \u2018virtual roll call\u2019 prior to [the party\u2019s] scheduled August convention dates\u201d.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m confident that your attorneys are well-aware of this fact, and I suspect your current rhetorical posturing is part of a plan to replace the incumbent president without a contested convention or any kind of democratic process,\u201d he wrote on July 25.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clever, if not completely antithetical to your party\u2019s relentless finger wagging about threats to democracy, but I ask that you stop using Ohio to justify your course of action.\u201d\n\nHe added that, as long as Democrats certify their nominations for president and vice president by September 1, they would appear on Ohio ballots in November.\n\nWhat about Harris\u2019s vice presidential pick?\n\nHarris has been in the presidential race for less than two weeks at this point. She has not yet picked a vice president to run alongside her on the Democratic ticket.\n\nBut US media outlets have reported that her running mate could be announced any day now.\n\nSeveral names have emerged atop the list of possible vice-presidential nominees, including Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro.\n\nHarris can still announce her vice presidential pick after the virtual nomination process is complete, according to the revised DNC rules. That person would then be added to her ticket.\n\nSo if Harris and her VP are confirmed, what happens at the convention?\n\nTypically, the conventions are where the roll-call votes take place. So what now?\n\nThis month\u2019s Democratic convention will still host votes \u2014 including a state-by-state roll call \u2014 to recognise the party\u2019s presidential and vice-presidential nominees, but they will be \u201ccelebratory and ceremonial\u201d, the DNC says on its website.\n\nWhile the nominees can theoretically be contested, most conventions in recent years have served as a platform to unite party members behind their respective candidates.\n\nThe Democratic National Convention will take place over four days, from August 19 to 22, in Chicago, Illinois.",

The opposition published more than 80% of electoral tally sheets they directly received from polling stations on Election Day .",
        "text": "Venezuelan opposition leader thanks U.S. for recognizing him as presidential election's winner\nVenezuela's opposition candidate Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia thanked the U.S. on Friday for recognizing him as the official winner of Sunday's controversial presidential election, in which both Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia and President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro claimed victory.\n\n\"We thank the United States for recognizing the will of the Venezuelan people reflected in our electoral victory and for supporting the process of restoring democratic norms in Venezuela,\" Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia wrote on X.\n\nThe United States' recognition of Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia as Venezuela's president-elect is based on evidence the opposition released this week, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Thursday night.\n\nThe opposition published more than 80% of electoral tally sheets they directly received from polling stations throughout Venezuela on Election Day. Those tallies show that Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia obtained 66% of the votes while Maduro received about 31%, according to a site NBC News accessed on Wednesday where the opposition released the results of their count.\n\n\"Those tally sheets indicate that Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia received the most votes in this election by an insurmountable margin,\" Blinken said in a statement Thursday. \"Given the overwhelming evidence, it is clear to the United States and, most importantly, to the Venezuelan people that Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia won.\"\n\nThe U.S. now joins Uruguay, Argentina and Peru, the first nation to recognize Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia's win, in discrediting the official election results announced by Maduro's regime.\n\nA few hours after Blinken's announcement on Thursday, half a dozen masked assailants ransacked the headquarters of the opposition party, including the office of Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, the main leader of the opposition movement who was barred from being on the ballot by Maduro's government.\n\nVente Venezuela, the opposition party Machado belongs to, published images on social media showing several walls covered in black spray paint alongside a message saying the assailants broke down doors and hauled away valuable documents and equipment in raid they said happened at around 3 a.m.\n\nThe raid follows threats by Maduro and top government officials who are loyal to him to arrest Machado. While it\u2019s unclear whether there is an official arrest warrant against her, Machado said she has gone into hiding out of fear.\n\nWhile in hiding, she has continued to urge the international community to challenge the election results announced by Maduro\u2019s regime and called on her supporters to show up to a demonstration in Caracas Saturday.\n\nOpposition leader Maria Corina Machado, center left, and opposition presidential candidate Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez, center right, greet supporters at a protest against the result of the presidential election in Caracas, Venezuela, on Tuesday. Jesus Vargas / Getty Images\n\nCalls from multiple governments, including close allies of Maduro like Colombia and Brazil, are pushing for Venezuela\u2019s National Electoral Council to release detailed vote counts, as it has done during previous elections.\n\nThe electoral body, which is loyal to Maduro's regime, declared him the winner Monday, claiming he was re-elected for a third term after winning 51% of the votes without releasing the vote counts that would help corroborate such results. On Friday, Elvis Amoroso of the National Electoral Council insisted Maduro won, claiming that his margin of victory remained relatively the same after accounting for 97% of the votes.\n\nAmoroso did not provide detailed electoral tallies that governments around the world have called for.\n\nThe governments of Brazil, Colombia and Mexico issued a joint statement Thursday doubling down on their calls for an independent review of election results and urging Venezuela\u2019s electoral authorities \u201cto move forward expeditiously and publicly release\u201d detailed voting data.\n\n\u201cThe fundamental principle of popular sovereignty must be respected through impartial verification of the results,\u201d the statement reads.\n\nThe statement does not confirm any backroom diplomatic efforts to persuade Maduro\u2019s government to publish the vote tallies.\n\nGovernment officials from Brazil, Colombia and Mexico have told The Associated Press that they have been in constant communication with Maduro\u2019s administration to convince him that he must show the vote tally sheets from Sunday\u2019s election and allow impartial verification.\n\nOn Wednesday, Maduro asked Venezuela\u2019s highest court to conduct an audit of the election, but hat request drew criticism from foreign observers who said the court is controlled by Maduro sympathizers. It is also the same court that banned Machado from being on the ballot in January, causing Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia to emerge as the opposition\u2019s surrogate candidate in May.\n\nOn Thursday, the court accepted Maduro\u2019s request for an audit and ordered him, Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia and the eight other candidates who participated in the presidential election to appear before the justices Friday.\n\nAsked why electoral authorities have not released detailed vote counts, Maduro said the National Electoral Council has come under attack, including cyber-attacks, without elaborating.\n\nThe controversy over the election results is fueling fears of increased protests and violence amid the international debate and lack of consensus.\n\nSince protests broke out Monday, thousands of opposition supporters have taken to the streets and the Venezuelan government has said it's arrested hundreds of protesters, including former opposition candidate Freddy Superlano.\n\nThe Venezuelan nongovernmental organization Pro Vea has identified at least 15 protesters who have been killed since demonstrations began, and it continues to verify more reports of deaths.\n\nVenezuela has the world\u2019s largest proven crude reserves and once boasted Latin America\u2019s most advanced economy, but it entered into free fall after Maduro took the helm in 2013. Plummeting oil prices, widespread shortages and hyperinflation that soared past 130,000% led to social unrest and mass emigration.\n\nMore than 7.7 million Venezuelans have left the country since 2014, the largest exodus in Latin America\u2019s recent history.",

Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n\nJD Vance is making a second pass at introducing himself to America as the Ohio senator faces questions on whether he was the best choice for former President Donald Trump\u2019s running mate after his past comments came to light.\n\nSimply put, the plan to get past this stretch is more Vance, not less, and the vice presidential nominee\u2019s days have been filled with visits to battleground states.\n\nHe spoke at a campaign rally in Nevada on Tuesday and another in Arizona on Wednesday. On Thursday morning, he is scheduled to go to the US-Mexico border, a regular campaign pilgrimage for Republicans. He will also appear in Georgia with Trump on Saturday.\n\nThere are plans for Vance to sit for a series of interviews with conservative and mainstream media outlets, according to people with knowledge of his upcoming schedule. The Trump campaign also hopes to capitalize on the generational contrast Vance brings to the race \u2014 he turns 40 on Friday \u2014 by having him appear on longer-form podcasts and digital shows that target younger audiences.\n\nVance is also expected to begin holding news conferences with reporters as early as this week, a source said.\n\nAnd he will be tasked as the campaign\u2019s policy attack dog, a role he embraced Tuesday as he stumped across Nevada trashing Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 past immigration stances and tying her to the current administration\u2019s recent battles with inflation.\n\nHarris, meanwhile, is set to travel to several battlegrounds next week with her running mate, whom she is expected to announce in the coming days.\n\nRead more here.",

What will happen in US Presidential Election 2024?\nVoters happy at Joe Biden's decision\n\n\n\nKamala Harris leads Leger Poll\n\n\n\nThe Civiqs Poll\n\n\n\nYouGov Survey\n\n\n\nFAQs:\n\n\n\n\n\n(You can now subscribe to our\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel\n\nThough voting for the US Presidential Election 2024 will be held three months from now and it is too early to predict the result, it is clear that Democrat presumptive candidate Kamala Harris is surging ahead, and that too at a fast pace, pushing Republican candidate Donald Trump behind. It can be concluded by the results of six opinion polls held within 48 hours. Harris was ahead in four polls while Trump was leading in just two surveys. According to 'Newsweek', Kamala Harris was up by 4 percentage points in a Civiqs survey, 3 points in a Leger survey, 2 points in a YouGov survey and a point in an Ispos survey. On the other hand, Trump got a 2-point advantage in a McLaughlin poll and a 2.6-point advantage in an ActiVote poll.The voters are happy with US President Joe Biden's decision of pulling out of the race and endorsing his vice president. The way Democrats rallied behind Kamala Harris is showing positive signs and may pay rich dividends to the party that was in shambles over the question of leadership only a few weeks ago.According to 'Newsweek', in the Leger poll, Kamala Harris got a 3-point advantage over Donald Trump in a head-to-head contest, she led with a bigger margin when other candidates were taken into out as well. While the Democrat contender led the Republican candidate by 7 points, with 48 percent support to his 41 percent with independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. leading third-party candidates at 5 percent. The Leger poll was held from July 26 to July 28 and 1,002 people were contacted.Kamala Harris was seen getting strong support from people in the age group of 18 to 49 and Trump was found trailing by four points in the Civiqs poll. The Democrat has a higher winnability rating than both Trump and his running mate, Ohio Senator JD Vance. While 43% of respondents have a favorable opinion of the vice president, 42% favor Trump and 34 percent Vance.When the YouGov survey was conducted before Harris replaced Biden, Trump led by 2 points. But in Thursday's poll, Kamala Harris was seen bringing Democrats up 4 points and holding the advantage over Trump, with 46 percent to his 44 percent. The poll was held on July 27 and July 30 and 1,605 adults were contacted.Kamala Harris was seen getting strong support from people in the age group of 18 to 49 and Trump was found trailing by four points in the Civiqs poll. The Democrat has a higher winnability rating than both Trump and his running mate, Ohio Senator JD Vance.Republican candidate Donald Trump got a 2-point advantage in a McLaughlin poll and a 2.6-point advantage in an ActiVote poll.",

America\u2019s Finally About to Try It.\n\u201cPolitics can feel like such a slog,\u201d Katie Paris, the founder of a political organization for suburban moms called Red, Wine & Blue, told the New York Times for a recent story about Kamala Harris\u2019 campaign momentum. \u201cNobody likes two-year presidential campaigns.\u201d The switch from Joe Biden to Harris had revitalized her organization, she said, and renewed her enthusiasm for the Democratic ticket.\n\nThis sudden energy is not unique to Katie Paris or to Red, Wine & Blue. Things really do feel better now! Of course, a great deal of that change is due to the different name on the yard signs. But part of it, too, comes from the way the presidential election seems to have been fully rebooted. Instead of feeling, accurately, like we\u2019re stuck in the middle of an eternal campaign that\u2019s been going on as long as we can remember, it feels like a brand-new beginning, with the ending already in sight.\n\nWelcome to the 107-Day Campaign. That\u2019s the number of days between July 21, when Biden withdrew, and Election Day. After loads of hand-wringing about how it was definitely too late to change candidates, it turns out that the Democrats\u2019 Hail Mary has given Americans a great gift: our first taste of a short presidential election in 50-plus years. When it\u2019s over, we\u2019re going to wish elections were all like this.\n\nRelated From Slate A Crucial Wisconsin Town Voted for Joe Biden by 19 Votes in 2020. People Here Have Thoughts About Kamala Harris. Read More\n\nThe race for the U.S. presidency hasn\u2019t always been a two-year nightmare. As recently as 1952, Dwight Eisenhower didn\u2019t even really start campaigning for president until June. (Before that, he was serving overseas as NATO commander.) But in the wake of the turbulent 1968 Democratic Convention, when many voters felt that Hubert Humphrey\u2014who hadn\u2019t even participated in the primaries\u2014had been handpicked by the party establishment, the McGovern-Fraser reforms gave voters a much greater say in the selection of Democratic candidates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSoon, states were changing caucuses to primaries, and then moving primaries earlier and earlier to beat each other out. State-by-state advertising arms races escalated until we got to where we are today\u2014a 2024 election season that officially started in November 2022, when Donald Trump announced his candidacy. That\u2019s just too long.\n\nOther countries don\u2019t do it this way! France\u2019s recent presidential election was about six weeks long: It started when the candidates declared in early March 2022, and ended with a second round of voting on April 24, 2022. The most recent Canadian election was just over a month long. In Japan, general election campaigns are restricted to 12 days. (OK, that might be a little short\u2014in the 2014 elections, the opposition party, caught by surprise, could barely scrape together candidates to run.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe advantages of a short campaign are obvious. Advertising plays a less crucial role, reducing the chances for deceptive or misleading messaging to sink in. Candidates spend less money, and therefore demand less money from rich donors with questionable objectives. (It also means that candidates without enormous war chests might stand a chance.) A shorter campaign lessens the endless horse-race coverage that rules in long campaigns when there\u2019s little to no actual news. Grueling campaigns grind down candidates, exhaust voters, and rarely teach us anything new about the possibilities, anyway: The voters who are really paying attention make up their minds quickly, and the voters who aren\u2019t paying attention\u2014the ones, by the way, who will decide this race\u2014don\u2019t even think about the election until, like, two weeks before. Does anyone really think they\u2019ve learned something new about Joe Biden and Donald Trump since January?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd honestly, long campaigns are flat-out toxic to everyone\u2019s well-being. No one other than actual politicians should be forced to think about politics for two straight years. What a drag! Think about all you could have gotten done if you hadn\u2019t been trying to keep up with Republican debates last August. Slate\u2019s politics writers would all have much lower blood pressure, because they could have been writing regular, interesting politics stories instead of chronicling this awful, not-normal election since the dawn of time. (They also might have had a little more time to pursue their cool hobbies, like golf, surfing, and lawn care.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShort campaigns can also lead to delightful surprises. In January of 2016, I visited Reykjavik and met a friendly history professor named Gu\u00f0ni J\u00f3hannesson at a municipal swimming pool. That spring he appeared on the TV news a couple of times, discussing the Panama Papers scandal, and often would return home to voicemails suggesting he run for president. In May he declared his candidacy; in June he was elected; on Aug. 1 he took office. He was a perfectly good president for eight years and a new president just took office earlier this week. You think Gu\u00f0ni would have run for president if it meant he had to turn his life upside down for two years?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, granted, many of these countries have systems that afford less power to the president than the United States does. (Would we want some random historian to become president? Well, I would, but maybe not everyone agrees.) But Mexico has a government system much like ours, with a president who\u2019s head of the executive branch, a bicameral legislature, and an independent judiciary. In Mexico, presidential elections are restricted to three months, with a two-month period the summer before to pick the major party nominees. Imagine if American presidential candidates declared during spring break, primaried until June, and then we all voted in November? What a dream.\n\nPretty much everyone in America, with the possible exception of local-TV ad salespeople in Wisconsin, hates our forever elections. Thanks to Joe Biden\u2019s decision to step away from the campaign, we\u2019ve been given a gift few living Americans have ever experienced as voters: a short, sweet election that just might end before we\u2019re all completely exhausted, annoyed, and disengaged. It\u2019s gonna be so much better. We should do whatever it takes to make this situation permanent. Take it from Katie Paris of Red, Wine & Blue. \u201cGive me 100 days, and OK!\u201d she said. \u201cI can grab my friends and do that.\u201d",

        "text": "Democrats\u2019 nomination of Harris shows how parties still control the process\nVice President Kamala Harris, shown here at a campaign event in Atlanta, Georgia, on July 30, is now officially the Democratic presidential nominee.\n\nVotebeat is a nonprofit news organization reporting on voting access and election administration across the U.S.\n\nThis news analysis also appears in Votebeat\u2019s free weekly newsletter. Sign up to get future editions, including the latest reporting from Votebeat bureaus and curated news from other publications, delivered to your inbox every Saturday.\n\nDemocrats have nominated Kamala Harris as their 2024 presidential candidate \u2014 even though voters chose someone else in all the party\u2019s primaries. Can they just do that?\n\nSure. As it turns out, presidential primaries are something of an electoral illusion \u2014 and a rather convincing one.\n\nWhen President Joe Biden withdrew his reelection bid shortly before he was set to officially receive the nomination at the convention, it prompted everyone to take a crash course in How Parties Select Presidential Nominees.\n\nAnd as we\u2019re seeing now, parties can actually select their presidential nominees however they want, even if there are many reasons to abide by the voters\u2019 choice in the primaries.\n\nPeople accustomed to thinking of primaries in the straightforward mode of other elections \u2014 a candidate wins by getting the most votes \u2014 might find them to be a strange sort of beast, neither fish nor fowl. Political scientists and historians can provide the context that helps make sense of this curious process.\n\n\u201cOur parties operate in a kind of fiction of being public democracies,\u201d said Alexander Keyssar, a professor of history and social policy at Harvard University\u2019s Kennedy School of Government and the author of \u201cThe Right to Vote: The Contested History of Democracy in the United States.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the same time,\u201d he said, \u201cthe party itself retains some right of control.\u201d\n\nMost people probably think primary results are \u201cmore binding and durable\u201d than they really are, Keyssar said.\n\nThe Democratic presidential primaries this year weren\u2019t especially competitive. Biden, an incumbent president, faced fairly nominal opposition and won easily.\n\nBut remember that when people cast a presidential primary ballot, they\u2019re not really voting for the candidate. They\u2019re voting for a slate of delegates to the convention who pledge to support that candidate, at least on the first ballot. As candidates win more contests, they amass more convention delegates. And it\u2019s those delegates who ultimately select the nominee with their vote.\n\nAt least in theory, if enough delegates don\u2019t like the rules governing the process, they can just change them. \u201cA majority of delegates can decide whatever they want,\u201d points out Robert Speel, an associate professor of political science at Penn State Behrend.\n\nBut that might not be good politics.\n\nBiden\u2019s withdrawal created a scenario that was nearly unprecedented in modern times. The comparison many observers reached for was the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago \u2014 a contentious nomination process set against a backdrop of antiwar protests and a violent police response. The episode led to the creation of the modern primary system \u2014 and it explains a lot about why parties stick with it.\n\nBefore that point, different versions of primaries existed, but they didn\u2019t matter as much. Not all candidates chose to participate in them, and some did so more as a political tactic than a requirement, experts say. For example, John F. Kennedy famously used the 1960 West Virginia primary to show that a Catholic candidate could win support in Protestant parts of the country. So candidates competed in primaries, but in the end, party bosses controlled the candidate selection process.\n\nThat became most evident at the 1968 convention. Then-President Lyndon B. Johnson, facing poor approval ratings and dwindling support, had decided not to run for reelection. Robert F. Kennedy, a leading candidate for the Democratic nomination, had been assassinated two months earlier, immediately after sweeping the California primary. Democrats were, as some like to say, in disarray. At the convention, delegates nominated the sitting vice president, Hubert Humphrey, who hadn\u2019t competed in a single primary.\n\nHumphrey went on to lose to Republican Richard Nixon, and Democrats decided there had to be a better way. They appointed a commission headed by then-Sen. George McGovern of South Dakota to come up with it. The commission was \u201cthe biggest single change for the process of presidential selection in American history,\u201d said Byron Shafer, who wrote a book about it called \u201cQuiet Revolution: Struggle for the Democratic Party and the Shaping of Post-Reform Politics.\u201d\n\nThe result was, more or less, the primary system we have today, putting more power in the hands of ordinary voters, and linking delegates more tightly to candidates and nominees more tightly to the results. Republicans eventually adopted a similar process, though there appear to have been at least some skeptics. A memo sent to Nixon in June 1972 and now in the collection of the National Archives crowed, \u201cIn the name of \u2018reform\u2019, the Democrats have allowed the control of their party to pass into the hands of an ultra liberal, activist minority which is unrepresentative of any of the former factions of the old coalition.\u201d\n\nThe first Democratic presidential nominee produced under the new system was McGovern himself, who lost to Nixon resoundingly. But the process he brought about \u2014 using more robust primaries to democratize the selection of delegates, and shift power from party bosses and insiders to regular party members \u2014 has mostly stuck.\n\nIn 1980, a different commission created so-called superdelegates \u2014 typically party and elected officials with special voting power \u2014 as a check on the vagaries of the democratic process McGovern\u2019s commission created.\n\nBut the voting public has been hostile to ceding this power, and any suggestion that they might not have the final say. For example, in 2008, when the upstart Barack Obama was edging past establishment candidate Hillary Clinton for the presidential nomination, the idea that the superdelegates could tip the balance back to Clinton caused an uproar, and many of the superdelegates ended up switching their support to Obama. The issue came up again in 2016, when Clinton faced a strong challenge from Sen. Bernie Sanders.\n\nIn the case of today\u2019s presidential shakeup, Shafer and others say, the delegates who were pledged to Biden took his quick endorsement of Harris to heart. She was, after all, on the same ticket when primary voters cast their ballots.\n\nShafer, who taught in Britain for years, said the U.S. system was always hard to explain to students living in a country with strong parties. There are no primaries for prime minister.\n\nBut the system is unlikely to change now, he would tell them.\n\n\u201cTry taking a primary away from people once you give it to them.\u201d\n\nCarrie Levine is Votebeat\u2019s managing editor and is based in Washington, D.C.

        "text": "Harris and Trump are tied in 538's new polling averages\nGood news, polling fans: 538 now has polling averages for the new presidential matchup between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. As of Friday at 10 a.m. Eastern, our average of national polls says Harris has the support of 45.0 percent of voters, while Trump garners 43.5 percent.\n\nThat 1.5-percentage-point lead is within our average's uncertainty interval, which you can think of as a sort of margin of error for our polling averages. We also have new Harris versus Trump polling averages for the key swing states of Georgia, Michigan and Pennsylvania, and the races there are within the uncertainty interval as well. (We will add polling averages for additional states as soon as we get enough polls in them.*)\n\nVice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are tied in 538's new presidential general election polling average. 538 Photo Illustration\n\n538's averages are slightly better for Harris than the ones you'll find from other public aggregators. There are a few reasons for this. The most important is that our average only considers polls that began interviewing voters after President Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential election and endorsed Harris to be the Democratic nominee. (It is long-standing 538 policy not to include horse-race polls with candidates that aren't actually running in our models.) Because those earlier polls were asking about a then-hypothetical matchup, voters may have been thinking about the candidates in theoretical ways that are no longer relevant to today's very real contest. Indeed, by our estimate, Harris has performed about 3 points better nationally in polls conducted after Biden's withdrawal than before it.\n\nAnother reason our averages are better for Harris is that 538 adjusts polls that were conducted among registered voters (marked as \"RV\" on our polls page) or all adults (\"A\") toward the results of likely voter (\"LV\") polls. We make this adjustment because we know for a fact that not all adults or even all registered voters will vote in the election, and the types of people who vote differ from nonvoters in predictable ways.\n\nSpecifically, there is evidence that likely voters are now a bit more Democratic than the general population; for example, likely voter polls of Trump versus Biden tended to look better for Democrats than polls of that matchup among registered voters or all adults. Our average makes this adjustment by looking for systematic differences between likely voter and registered voter/all adult polls after controlling for other factors, such as the pollster who conducted the poll, the mode it was conducted with, the time it was conducted, etc.\n\nWithout this adjustment, Harris and Trump would be tied at 44.0 percent nationally (based on polls conducted since July 22 and released by Aug. 1). But Harris's margin is about 0.2 points higher in likely voter polls than in registered voter polls and about 0.6 points higher in likely voter polls than in polls of all adults. Controlling for this alone increases our estimate of Harris's margin by 0.5 points.\n\n538's polling averages also look for differences between polls that do and do not give voters the ability to say they support third-party candidates, such as independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (who currently averages 5.7 percent support nationally). We make this adjustment because most voters will have more options than just Harris and Trump on Election Day (depending on which candidates qualify for the ballot in which states), so head-to-head polls are not asking about a real election either. We find that, when Kennedy is included in polls, Harris's margin over Trump grows by about 0.5 points.\n\nFinally, Harris gets another boost in our national average because of how well she is doing in the few state polls that have been conducted since Biden's withdrawal. On average, in 2020, Biden beat Trump by 3.8 points in the states that have been polled for Harris versus Trump so far. Her average polling lead in those states today is 1.1 points. If you apply that 2.7-point shift toward Trump to the national popular vote (which Biden won by 4.5 points in 2020), you get a predicted national environment of Harris+1.8 today.\n\nAll in all, Harris is polling better against Trump than Biden, who was trailing by more than 3 points nationally on the day he dropped out. (You can still access our old Biden-Trump averages by clicking the link in the banner at the top of our national polling average page or at the top of any state polling page that used to have a Biden-Trump average.) But it's an open question whether that will last. As the new nominee, Harris may be enjoying a honeymoon period, and an amped-up Democratic base may be more likely to respond to surveys than Republicans \u2014 a phenomenon known as differential partisan nonresponse. It's also possible that the initial boost of enthusiasm she has received will fade over time. You can bookmark the interactive page for our new averages and keep up with the latest polls as soon as they come in.\n\nFootnotes\n\n*As explained in our polls policy, we do not publish polling averages of presidential general elections in a given state until we've aggregated at least five polls of that state from at least three pollsters. In this unique circumstance, we are further limiting that to polls conducted entirely after Biden dropped out. For aesthetic reasons, we also wait a few days after meeting this threshold to publish the average, so that the chart doesn't just have one point and one day of a line on it. That's why Arizona and Wisconsin, which have already met the five poll/three pollster threshold, don't have averages yet; we plan to publish those by Monday.",

        "text": "Fact: In NC, if an Election Worker Writes on Your Ballot, It Does Not Invalidate It\nRaleigh, N.C.\n\nThe following is a statement from the State Board of Elections regarding social media posts and other communications suggesting that if an election worker writes on your ballot, it would invalidate it.\n\nIn North Carolina, this is false. These posts have been circulating for years and have resurfaced recently in many N.C. counties. They are still false.\n\nElection workers often do write on ballots for different reasons as required by law.\n\nFor example, election workers write an identifying number on the ballots of voters who vote by mail or during the in-person early voting period. This is a special number assigned to each ballot and voter. This number allows the ballot to be retrieved and not counted if necessary due to a voter challenge, such as if the voter dies before Election Day or votes more than once. See Retrievable ballots (N.C.G.S. \u00a7 163-166.45).\n\nThe number can also be used to retrieve ballots in the event of a successful election protest, such as if several voters are given the wrong ballot style and the margin for a contest is less than that number of voters.\n\nIn certain counties, voters\u2019 precincts also must be written on ballots cast during the early voting period so they can be sorted back into the proper precincts after the election for reporting and data purposes, also as required by law. See Voting data maintained by precinct (N.C.G.S. \u00a7 163-132.5G). Early voters may cast their ballot at any early voting site in their county, thus creating the need to sort ballots by precinct after each election.\n\nElection Day ballots are not retrievable, but poll workers may need to write the precinct name on ballots for post-election sorting. They may also write notations on provisional ballots.\n\nPoll workers should generally not be placing any other markings on the ballot. But stray marks on a ballot should not prevent the ballot from being tabulated, as long as the bars on the margin of the ballot and the selection ovals are not affected. Once the ballot goes into the tabulator, the machine uses the bars and the shading of ovals to determine the selections on that ballot, and that ballot will be tabulated just like any other ballot that gets inserted into the tabulator, regardless of any writing in the white space of the ballot.\n\nThe 2024 general election is 95 days away on Nov. 5. The first absentee ballots are expected to be sent out on Sept. 6. In-person early voting runs from Oct. 17 through Nov. 2.\n\nFor accurate information about N.C. elections, go to ncsbe.gov or contact your county board of elections.",

The Democratic National Committee held a livestream video hosted by Biden campaign aides and DNC chairman Jaime Harrison to mark the occasion.\n\n\"I am honored to be the presumptive Democratic nominee for President of the United States,\" Harris said moments after she passed the delegate threshold during a Democratic party-sponsored livestream phone call. \"Your dedication cannot be overstated.

We love our country, we believe in the promise of America, and that's what this campaign is about.\"\n\nHarris said she will officially accept the nomination next week, once the virtual voting period concludes on Monday. She added that she's looking forward to the Democratic National Convention that begins Aug. 19 in Chicago to \"have an opportunity to celebrate this historic moment together.\"\n\nHarris, 59, catapulted to the top of the ticket after President Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential election on July 21. Harris will go on to face Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, the 45th president, in November.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nVice President Harris quickly gained the backing of top leaders in her party, including Biden, former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. She's also been raking in record-breaking donations less than two weeks into her candidacy.\n\nThe DNC began a virtual roll call on Thursday at 9 a.m. for delegates to vote for Harris as the party\u2019s candidate. Delegates still have until the deadline on Monday at 6 p.m. ET to return their ballots.\n\n\u201cI am so proud to confirm that Vice President Harris has earned more than a majority of votes from all convention delegates and will be the nominee of the Democratic Party,\u201d Harrison said during the livestream.\n\nHe added: \u201cToday, my friends, is special because we can proudly say that we will have the first woman of color at the top of a major party ticket.\u201d\n\nEven before voting opened, Harris had accumulated more than enough delegate support to win the nomination.\n\nHarris is expected to announce a vice presidential candidate before she is scheduled to appear in Philadelphia on Tuesday with her highly anticipated running mate. Additional stops next week for the duo are planned for western Wisconsin; Detroit; Raleigh, N.C.; Savannah, Ga.; Phoenix; and Las Vegas.\n\nThe DNC imposed a Wednesday deadline to virtually confirm the party's presidential and vice presidential nominees ahead of the Democratic National Convention later this month.\n\nWith less than 100 days until the election, the race between the two candidates is heating up.\n\nTrump, the Republican nominee, and Harris are in a dead heat in several competitive, battleground states.\n\nThe former president has come out swinging against the Democratic candidate. During a combative interview on Wednesday at the National Association of Black Journalists annual conference, Trump used racist rhetoric toward Harris, questioning her racial identity. Harris, who slammed Trump's remarks, is Black and of South Asian descent.\n\nHarris is facing an uptick in racist and misogynistic attacks after she became the leading candidate for the Democrats.\n\nTrump and GOP allies have labeled Harris as a \u201cDEI candidate\u201d \u2212 a talking point using the acronym for diversity, equity and inclusion that conservatives are using to disqualify people of color or women who ascend to positions of power and influence.\n\nDays after Harris became the Democratic candidate, a video of Sen. JD Vance, Trump\u2019s running mate, resurfaced that implied Harris was among top Democrats who were \u201cchildless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they\u2019ve made.\u201d\n\nVance made those comments during an appearance on Fox News' \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" in July 2021 while he was running for Ohio's U.S. Senate seat. He said at the time that \u201cthe entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children.\" Harris is the stepmother of two children.",

The Associated Press reviewed her birth certificate and it confirms that she was born in Oakland, California, in 1964 .",
        "text": "Trump supporters wasted no time in claiming Kamala Harris is ineligible to be president, but they\u2019re wrong\nYou may have heard the rumor that Kamala Harris isn\u2019t eligible to be president because neither of her parents was born in the United States and they had unclear citizenship status when Harris was born in Oakland, California, in 1964.\n\nThat\u2019s the false claim that some Harris opponents have begun recirculating since she became the Democrats\u2019 presumptive nominee for president following President Joe Biden\u2019s decision to step aside on July 21, 2024. The claim originated in 2020, when she was chosen as Biden\u2019s vice presidential running mate.\n\nJohn Eastman, Trump\u2019s former legal adviser who was indicted for allegedly interfering with the 2020 presidential election, originally circulated this claim. But mainstream legal scholars agree: There\u2019s no truth to it.\n\nThe recycling of this falsehood offers an opportunity to dive into the actual facts about presidential eligibility, by way of some candidates from recent history.\n\nHarris is protected by birthright citizenship\n\nHow do we know that claims about Harris\u2019 eligibility are wrong?\n\nArticle II, Section 1 of the Constitution sets the rule: \u201cNo Person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution,\u201d says Section 1, \u201cshall be eligible to the Office of President.\u201d\n\nThe other presidential requirements in the Constitution \u2014 that a candidate be at least 35 years old and have lived in the U.S. for 14 years prior to their candidacy \u2014 are fairly cut-and-dried. But what does the document mean by \u201cnatural born Citizen\u201d?\n\nThe original Constitution doesn\u2019t specify, but both courts and lawmakers have weighed in since the founding. The first piece of evidence is the 14th Amendment, which was enacted after the Civil War to ensure that formerly enslaved Black Americans and their children were recognized as citizens.\n\n\u201cAll persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof,\u201d the amendment states, \u201care citizens of the United States.\u201d\n\nThe 14th Amendment establishes what is commonly referred to as \u201cbirthright citizenship\u201d \u2014 that if a person is born on American soil, then there is nothing else they need to do to become a fully-fledged citizen of the United States. Supreme Court cases since the passage of the 14th Amendment clarify specifically that those born in America to foreign parents qualify as \u201cnatural born.\u201d\n\nWhether Harris would be an effective president is a matter for the voters to decide in a few months. But as a legal matter, she is absolutely eligible to hold the office. Because Harris was born in the U.S., the citizenship status or birthplace of either of her parents is irrelevant. Even those facts have not been enough to quiet some of the falsehood promoters, who more recently have claimed Harris was not born in the U.S. But her birth certificate was reviewed by The Associated Press, and it confirms that she was born in Oakland.\n\nCan foreign-born candidates serve as president?\n\nHistory has seen cases more complicated than Harris\u2019, with a number of presidential candidates who were not born in one of the 50 states. So does being born outside of the U.S. disqualify candidates from serving as president?\n\nNot necessarily. Take, for example, the late Arizona Senator John McCain, who was the Republican nominee in 2008. McCain was born not in a state, but in the Panama Canal Zone in 1936 while his father was stationed there as a naval officer. However, the Canal Zone was under American control at the time of McCain\u2019s birth. And because the 14th Amendment specifies that citizenship also applies to those \u201csubject to the jurisdiction\u201d of the U.S., McCain was eligible to serve as president.\n\nAt the time, McCain cited as precedent for his eligibility the successful nomination of Sen. Barry Goldwater, the 1964 Republican nominee who was born in 1909 in the Arizona Territory, just a few years before it was admitted to the union as a state.\n\nEven McCain\u2019s main Democratic rivals for the presidency, Sens. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, co-sponsored a resolution in April 2008 asserting that McCain was a \u201cnatural-born citizen\u201d and thus eligible to be president.\n\nMcCain was also likely in the clear because historically, U.S. law has said that someone \u201cborn outside the United States to a U.S. citizen parent (or parents) is a U.S. citizen at birth.\u201d This is the same precedent that, had he been elected president, would likely have applied to U.S. Senator and 2016 candidate Ted Cruz, a Republican representing Texas, who was born in Canada but whose mother was an American citizen by birth.\n\nRace and ethnicity in the background\n\nNo major candidate for the presidency has ever been in serious jeopardy because of the \u201cnatural born citizen\u201d clause, and Harris is no exception.\n\nThe Constitution does not protect her, however, from the same sorts of race-based political attacks that Donald Trump leveled against Obama, a yearslong crusade that came to be known as \u201cbirtherism.\u201d During Obama\u2019s presidency, Trump falsely asserted that Obama wasn\u2019t born in the United States. As has been documented, Obama was born in Hawaii.\n\nNone of the vice president\u2019s high-profile critics, including Trump, are making quite such extreme accusations against Harris. But as with Obama, there is an unspoken, racist implication: This candidate is foreign. They\u2019re not like you and me. They\u2019re anti-American.",

John Whitmire proudly endorses @KamalaHarris for President of the United States. pic.twitter.com/2Cz1eiLu74 \u2014 John Whitmire (@whitmire_john) August 1, 2024\n\nQuestions were raised last month when Whitmire\u2019s name did not appear on a list of more than 300 Democratic mayors across the U.S. who endorsed Harris for president. The list included former Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner and other current Texas leaders like Austin Mayor Kirk Watson, San Antonio Mayor Ron Nirenberg and Port Arthur Mayor Thurman Bartie.\n\nHis endorsement came on the second day of Harris\u2019s visit to Houston this week. Thursday, she delivered a eulogy for the late U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee at a north Houston church. She was also in Houston July 23, when Whitmire greeted the vice president upon her arrival to the city. During that trip, Harris was briefed on the city\u2019s recovery efforts after Hurricane Beryl and delivered a speech at the American Federation of Teachers national convention.\n\nRELATED: Kamala Harris in Houston on Thursday to speak at teachers union convention\n\nSeveral Houston area lawmakers have pitched in their endorsements of the former prosecutor since President Joe Biden announced he would not seek reelection as president this year.\n\nA survey from the Associated Press last month quickly showed Harris secured the support of enough party delegates within days to become the presidential nominee who will run against former president and Republican candidate Donald Trump.",

        "text": "US candidate Jill Stein considering vocal Palestine advocates for VP spot\nShortlist of running mates for Green Party candidate includes two Arab Americans from the swing state of Michigan.\n\nUnited States Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein is considering three Palestinian rights advocates, including two Arab Americans, to be her running mate in the elections, her campaign has confirmed.\n\nThe vice president announcement will be made during a livestream rally on Thursday, the Stein campaign told Al Jazeera.\n\nThe candidates are Abed Ayoub, executive director at the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC); Amer Zahr, a Palestinian American activist; and Jacqueline Luqman, a journalist and activist.\n\nAll three have been vocal critics of Israel and the US\u2019s unflinching support for the war on Gaza. Stein, a physician and activist, herself is a longtime supporter of Palestinian rights.\n\nHaving one of the three on the ballot could boost Stein\u2019s chances of tapping into the mass of disaffected voters who have grown angry with the mainstream Democratic Party\u2019s stance on Israel.\n\nWhile Stein\u2019s campaign is a long-shot bid, with US politics dominated by the Republican and Democrat parties, if she wins a significant share of the votes, her campaign may affect the result of the election.\n\nMoreover, Stein\u2019s supporters say they hope that her candidacy could broaden the conversation around Gaza and amplify voters\u2019 concerns with US policy.\n\nWith a Palestine advocate on the ticket, Stein\u2019s candidacy could also force Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, to further contend with the growing frustration with President Joe Biden\u2019s unconditional backing of Israel.\n\nEven with a small percentage of the votes, Stein\u2019s campaign could make a major impression on the election in places like the swing state of Michigan \u2013 home to large Arab- and Muslim-American communities.\n\nBoth Ayoub and Zahr are from Michigan.\n\n\u2018Honoured\u2019\n\nLuqman, Zahr and Ayoub all confirmed to Al Jazeera that they were approached by the campaign and said they were \u201chonoured\u201d to be considered for the position.\n\nAyoub said it is \u201cimportant\u201d that Stein is considering Palestinian rights advocates to be her running mate.\n\n\u201cThis is a critical time. This is a time where the genocide is in front of everybody\u2019s eyes. There\u2019s no hiding from it. And it\u2019s a time where most of the world and many Americans see how complicit and active both parties are in the genocide.\u201d\n\nZahr also said selecting a vocal supporter of Palestinian rights as Stein\u2019s running mate was a \u201csmart choice\u201d by the campaign.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that the genocide in Gaza has dominated the entire presidential campaign,\u201d Zahr told Al Jazeera.\n\nWhile Biden dropped out after growing concerns over his age following a disastrous debate performance in May, Zahr said the Democratic president\u2019s coalition \u201cwas falling apart\u201d because of the war on Gaza.\n\nLuqman said opposing the war on Gaza should not be a campaign issue, but a human issue. \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as lesser evil. Evil is evil, and genocide is evil,\u201d she told Al Jazeera.\n\nThe US-backed Israeli offensive in Gaza has killed at least 39,550 people, levelled large parts of the territory and brought its more than two million inhabitants to the verge of starvation.\n\nGaza and the elections\n\nWhile foreign policy is not usually a major factor in US elections, the war on Gaza has increasingly become a decisive issue in the presidential race.\n\nArabs, Muslims, young people and progressives have expressed anger at Biden\u2019s support for the war. And while it remains unclear how the issue will play out following the US president\u2019s withdrawal from the race and endorsement of Harris, some communities have shown willingness to break with Democrats over Gaza.\n\nPredominantly Arab neighbourhoods in places like the Detroit suburb of Dearborn voted overwhelmingly for Biden against former President Donald Trump in 2020, helping him win Michigan.\n\nBut with the war in Gaza, support for Biden dropped sharply in Arab-American communities, according to public opinion polls.\n\nThe US administration has signed off on at least $14bn in additional military aid to Israel and vetoed three United Nations Security Council proposals that would have called for a ceasefire in Gaza.\n\nThe White House has said that Harris has been a \u201cfull partner\u201d in shaping Gaza policy. Still, the vice president has expressed greater empathy for Palestinian suffering while still pledging \u201cunwavering commitment\u201d to Israel.\n\nHarris, who is set to become the Democratic candidate to take on Trump in November after securing enough delegates to win the nomination, has not selected a running mate.\n\nBut Palestinian rights advocates are pushing against a rumoured frontrunner for the position \u2013 Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, who earlier this year compared Gaza solidarity protesters on college campuses to the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nIn 2021, Shapiro \u2013 as Pennsylvania\u2019s attorney general \u2013 also backed sanctions against Ben & Jerry\u2019s after the ice cream company decided to stop doing business in the Israeli-occupied West Bank over ethical concerns.\n\nOpposition to Shapiro grew this week after The Philadelphia Inquirer unearthed a 1993 college newspaper op-ed, in which Shapiro played down the prospect of solving the conflict after White House talks between then-Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.\n\n\u201cPalestinians will not coexist peacefully,\u201d Shapiro wrote in the article. \u201cThey do not have the capabilities to establish their own homeland and make it successful even with the aid of Israel and the United States. They are too battle-minded to be able to establish a peaceful homeland of their own.\u201d\n\nWhy run?\n\nAs Democrats rally around Harris, they have portrayed Trump as an existential threat to US democracy.\n\nDemocratic officials have also accused Stein of helping the former president by taking progressive votes despite not having a realistic chance of winning.\n\nStein ran for president in 2012, 2016 and 2020 but never mounted a competitive campaign.\n\nLuqman, Ayoub and Zahr all said Stein\u2019s bid was about giving the voters a choice and challenging the monopoly of the two major parties on US politics.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t engage in the franchise of voting \u2026 only to vote for candidates who are guaranteed to win,\u201d Luqman told Al Jazeera.\n\n\u201cWe are supposed to exercise that right however we choose. And if the two major parties offered nothing for the people, then the people should have a right to cast their vote for candidates who they believe reflect their values.\u201d\n\nAyoub echoed that comment.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t go forward with politics as usual in this country. We can\u2019t allow the Democrats and Republicans to continue to play our communities, give false promises, allow for genocide and keep things as [they are],\u201d Ayoub told Al Jazeera.\n\nFor his part, Zahr said Stein\u2019s campaign can build awareness and help increase support for third-party candidates in the future.\n\n\u201cAs long as we say, \u2018Hey, third parties are a wasted vote\u2019, we perpetuate this system,\u201d Zahr told Al Jazeera. \u201cBy the way, this system with a liberal democratic president got us a US-funded genocide \u2013 not even with a right-wing president.\u201d",

        "text": "Harris rejects Trump's idea to debate her on FOX with live audience\nRepublican presidential nominee Donald Trump proposed to debate Democratic U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris on Fox News on September 4, and the Harris campaign said Trump is trying to back out of a debate that had been set to run on ABC.\n\nThe rules would be similar to the first debate with President Joe Biden, who has since dropped his reelection bid, Trump said in a post on Truth Social late Friday. But this time it would have a \"full arena audience\" and take place in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, Trump said.\n\nTrump and Biden had agreed to a second debate on September 10 on ABC News which the former president had suggested should be moved to Fox, the most popular network with his followers.\n\nHarris, who on Friday secured the delegate votes needed to clinch the Democratic nomination for the November 5 election, said Saturday that she plans to participate in the originally planned debate.\n\n\"It's interesting how 'any time, any place' becomes 'one specific time, one specific safe space,'\" she wrote on social media platform X. \"I'll be there on Sept. 10, like he agreed to. I hope to see him there.\"\n\nTrump 'running scared,' says Harris camp\n\nHarris spokesperson Michael Tyler said Trump is \"running scared\" and that her campaign is happy to discuss further debates after the September 10 one that \"both campaigns have already agreed to.\"\n\nOn Saturday, Trump said on Truth Social that Harris is \"afraid to do it\" and that he will see her on September 4, \"or I won't see her at all.\"\n\nOn Friday he said that the ABC debate had been \"terminated\" in that Biden would no longer be in it and because he himself was in litigation with ABC.\n\nABC on July 26 outlined qualification requirements for the debate but did not mention any candidates by name.\n\nRequirements include proving polling support and state ballot access by September 3.\n\nRecent polls show a tight contest between Harris and Trump, who had enjoyed a bigger lead over Biden after the first debate.\n\nABC News had no comment about whether Trump had dropped out of the debate, a spokesperson said.\n\nFox News did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump's proposal for the debate on Fox came right after the Democratic National Committee launched an advertising campaign Friday taunting him by saying \"the convicted felon is afraid to debate\" and questioning whether that is due to his stance on abortion.\n\nDavid Plouffe, an adviser to former President Barack Obama who recently joined the Harris campaign, posted on social media: \"Now, he seems only comfortable in a cocoon, asking his happy place Fox to host a Trump rally and call it a debate. Maybe he can only handle debating someone his own age.\"\n\nTrump is 78 and Harris is 59.\n\nFormer Democratic President Jimmy Carter, who turns 100 on Oct. 1, said, \"I'm only trying to make it to vote for Kamala Harris,\" the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported Saturday.",

But the conservative supermajority on the U.S. Supreme Court has handed her a lot of work to do.\n\nLast month, a six-justice majority delivered Trump a significant victory, ruling that he deserved substantial immunity from prosecution for official acts he took in the White House, including his efforts to get Department of Justice leaders to back his bogus claims of election fraud in 2020.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nLegal experts say Chutkan will need to review evidence at the heart of the historic four-count felony case, to determine whether other alleged actions by Trump get constitutional protection as official steps of a president, or whether they instead count as personal acts of a candidate seeking political office.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to the charges and has decried all four criminal cases against him as election interference. The current president, Joe Biden, has said he had no role in any of the prosecutions, and Attorney General Merrick Garland affirmed that stance in testimony to Congress.\n\nThere\u2019s no chance Trump will face trial in Washington before this November\u2019s election. The Supreme Court decision means Trump or special counsel Jack Smith could appeal any of the lower court\u2019s determinations about what counts as an official act -- before a jury is even seated in the case.\n\nIf Trump prevails at the ballot box this year, he could order his Justice Department to dismiss the D.C. case or attempt to pardon himself.",

        "text": "Harris\u2019 campaign raised massive $310 million in July as she looks to reset the race against Trump\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 campaign announced Friday that it raised $310 million last month, an eyepopping sum showing that donors who once seemed spooked about the prospects for November\u2019s election with President Joe Biden are now offering mountains of cash to boost his former No. 2.\n\nThe haul by Harris, the Democratic National Committee and affiliated entities far outpaced Republican former President Donald Trump, whose campaign and assorted committees said they took in $138.7 million for July.\n\nWATCH: Why the Harris campaign and Democrats are leaning into calling Trump \u2018weird\u2019\n\nThe vice president\u2019s campaign also says it entered August with $377 million in cash on hand, which it described as the most for any presidential candidate at this point in the cycle. It was also well above the $327 million Trump\u2019s team announced having to start the month.\n\n\u201cThe tremendous outpouring of support we\u2019ve seen in just a short time makes clear the Harris coalition is mobilized, growing, and ready to put in the work to defeat Trump this November,\u201d Harris campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said in a statement. \u201cOur money is going to the work that wins close elections.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s totals for July were augmented by an assassination attempt against the former president during a rally in Pennsylvania, which galvanized some of his fiercest supporters, and by his subsequent revealing of his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.\n\nHarris\u2019 team, meanwhile, is hoping for another jolt early next week, when she\u2019s expected to announce her own running mate, and during the Democratic convention, which opens in Chicago on Aug. 19.\n\nThe figures released by both campaigns this week do not include full Federal Elections Commission fillings, which will come later this month. That makes it difficult to determine how much of Harris\u2019 haul came after Biden announced on July 21 that he was abandoning his reelection bid and endorsing Harris.\n\nThat decision followed weeks of some top Democratic donors, as well as dozens of members of Congress, urging the 81-year-old president to step aside after his dismal debate performance on June 27.\n\nStill, Harris\u2019 team had previously announced that it took in more than $200 million during her first week as a presidential candidate, meaning that the lion\u2019s share of July\u2019s strong haul came after the vice president took over the top of the ticket. She is looking to reset the race against Trump, stepping up her travel schedule and sharply criticizing the Republican nominee as she leans more heavily into telling her personal and professional story.\n\nThe vice president is set to become her party\u2019s formal presidential nominee through virtual voting by Democratic convention delegates, set to conclude Monday.\n\nHer campaign said that two-thirds of its July donations came from first-time contributors in the 2024 election cycle. In all, the month saw more than 3 million donors make more than 4.2 million contributions \u2014 with more than 2 million donors making their first donation this cycle, while 94 percent of July\u2019s donations were under $200.\n\nThe campaign said 60 percent of its donors in July were women as Harris prepares to be the first woman of color to be nominated for president by a major political party.\n\nSince her presidential campaign began, Harris\u2019 fundraising has been bolstered by virtual fundraisers organized around supporters of distinct backgrounds including Black Women for Harris, Latinas for Harris and even a White Dudes for Harris. Together they raised more than $20 million, her campaign said.\n\nFundraising aside, the Harris campaign said that by last weekend it had signed up 170,000 new volunteers and held 2,300 events mobilizing thousands of supporters across battleground states.",

And so Democrats and people who are on the outside have a tendency to underestimate him, because he has misspellings in his tweets and he\u2019s very emotional and he doesn\u2019t know anything about policies.\n\n\u201cBut he does touch a chord in the American public.\u201d\n\nClark was speaking to the One Decision podcast, hosted by the journalist Julia Macfarlane and Sir Richard Dearlove, a former head of the British MI6 intelligence service.\n\nA tumultuous presidential election now pits Trump against Kamala Harris, the Democratic vice-president, after Joe Biden, 81, heeded calls to step aside for a younger candidate.\n\nHarris, 59, has enjoyed a surge of support, fundraising and positive polling.\n\nClark, 79, was Nato supreme allied commander, Europe, before retiring in 2000. He ran for the Democratic nomination in 2004, withdrawing after being outperformed in southern states, the basis of his planned challenge to George W Bush.\n\nSpeaking to One Decision, Clark said Trump, 78, retained his strong connection with the US public in part through playing on \u201ca chord of grievance\u201d about foreign wars.\n\nClark ran for president during wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Trump, he said, tapped into a distrust fed by those conflicts but which \u201cgoes back really to the aftermath of the war in Vietnam, which he didn\u2019t fight in, by the way, which he escaped with a spurious bone spur [note] from a doctor\u201d.\n\nAs a young soldier, Clark was severely wounded in Vietnam. Shot four times, he was awarded the Silver Star.\n\nHe continued: \u201cBut the point is, [Trump is] not to be underestimated as a politician. And I think a lot of the problems that President Biden had are traceable to Donald Trump, in foreign policy.\u201d\n\nClark cited the US withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, after Trump reached an agreement with the Taliban, but left Biden to end a 20-year US military presence with a chaotic evacuation.\n\nFor presidents, Clark said, foreign policy \u201calmost always\u201d produces a \u201ccrisis within the first year\u201d. Asked what challenges might await the next president, Clark identified \u201cmanaging China\u201d, maintaining Europe and Nato as partners in the face of Russian aggression and organising an alliance in opposition to Iran.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Stakes \u2014 Presidential Transition Free newsletter We will guide you through the aftermath of the US election and the transition to a Trump presidency Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Some of my friends tell me they\u2019ve already got five or six nuclear weapons. They\u2019re just waiting to test \u2026 and so this is going to be probably the first crisis that a President Kamala Harris has to face when she comes into office.\u201d\n\nFor that to happen, Harris and her as yet unnamed running mate must defeat Trump and his vice-presidential pick, JD Vance, a 39-year-old former marine turned hard-right Ohio senator.\n\nClark was asked about Trump\u2019s appeal to military veterans and voters, given proliferating reports of his remarks belittling service and sacrifice.\n\n\u201cI think Trump comes in with an advantage for the veterans vote simply because he\u2019s masculine,\u201d Clark said. \u201cHe \u2026 talks tough, and so a certain number of people will like that. [But] I can tell you support among the senior officer corps is maybe 5%, or maybe less, because people have seen him and worked for him up close.\n\n\u201cI have no respect for him whatsoever. He doesn\u2019t care about the facts, doesn\u2019t care about the concepts, doesn\u2019t learn, doesn\u2019t listen. [He\u2019s] not somebody who can be trusted with national security secrets. He\u2019s a security threat, etc, etc.\n\n\u201cBut you also have a divergence in the ranks of veterans because you have a number of African Americans and minority members. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to be inclined to vote for Mr Trump. So, hard to say, but my guess is the veterans vote on the whole will be maybe 55 to 60% against Trump.\u201d\n\nAsked if he thought the US military was ready to accept Harris as a female commander-in-chief, Clark said simply: \u201cSure. There\u2019s no problem there.\u201d",

US elections: Allan Lichtman claims on his YouTube channel that Vance would be a \u201chorror show\u201d if Trump were incapacitated and he had to take over as president.(Allan Lichtman/YouTube/AP)\n\nThe American University professor Lichtman has correctly predicted the outcome of almost every presidential election since 40th President Ronald Reagan's victory in 1984.\n\nUS VP choice \u2018incredibly important\u2019 but Vance is a \u2018disastrous pick\u2019: Lichtman\n\nLichtman claims on his YouTube channel that Vance would be a \u201chorror show\u201d if Trump were incapacitated and he had to take over as president.\n\nWhile stressing that vice presidential selection doesn't always swing the election, he called VP choice \u201cincredibly important\u201d. \u201cThat's why JD Vance was such a disastrous pick; he would be a horror show as president.\u201d\n\nThe purpose of choosing a running mate, according to him, is to have a successor in case the president steps down or dies, which has happened nine times in US history.\n\nSpeaking to Newsweek, he said Vance poses a challenge because his \u201cviews are even more extreme\u201d than those of Trump.\n\n\u201cFor example, on aid to Ukraine or wanting a national prohibition on abortion with no exception for rape, incest, or health of the mother. And Vance has become a lightning rod for criticism,\u201d he stated.\n\nAlso Read: Trump says JD Vance \u2018feels family is good\u2019 amid \u2018childless cat ladies' row\n\nHere's what Lichtman's model has to say on Kamala Harris\n\nThe Lichtman's model, which takes into account thirteen points, or \u201ckeys\u201d, currently projects that Harris is on the course of victory. Harris, who is scheduled to reveal her vice presidential candidate on Monday, has experienced an increase in her poll numbers.\n\nThe fresh impetus given to Harris' campaign might help her in a number of ways, such as reducing the number of voters who support third-party candidate Robert Kennedy Jr, Lichtman told C-SPAN.\n\nHe added that Joe Biden's withdrawal from the race and Harris' bid for the White House have a \u201cmixed\u201d impact. \u201cBut it doesn't fundamentally change my assessment that a lot would have to go wrong for the Democrats to lose.\u201d\n\nLichtman further announced that he will release his formal election forecast after Democratic convention.\n\n\u201cI plan to make my official prediction in August after the Democratic convention. See my assessment below on the 13 Keys Tracker on where The Keys stand NOW,\u201d he wrote on X.",

        "text": "How an Elon Musk PAC is using voter data to help Trump beat Harris in 2024 election\nIn this article TSLA Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nElon Musk, Chief Executive Officer of SpaceX and Tesla and owner of X speaks during the Milken Conference 2024 Global Conference Sessions at The Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California, U.S., May 6, 2024. David Swanson | Reuters\n\nIf a voter in Michigan performs a search on Google , a somewhat shocking ad might pop up. The ad shows a young man lying in bed late at night when someone else texts him, \"Hey you need to vote,\" and then sends the man a video of the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump. The man can hear the gunshots and people screaming in the background. As Trump is rushed off stage with blood pouring down his face, the man watching the video types in response, \"This is out of control. How do I start?\" The ad then displays a website for a group called America PAC. The website says it will help the viewer register to vote. But once a user clicks \"Register to Vote,\" the experience he or she will have can be very different, depending on where they live. If a user lives in a state that is not considered competitive in the presidential election, like California or Wyoming for example, they'll be prompted to enter their email addresses and ZIP code and then directed quickly to a voter registration page for their state, or back to the original sign-up section. But for users who enter a ZIP code that indicates they live in a battleground state, like Pennsylvania or Georgia, the process is very different. Rather than be directed to their state's voter registration page, they instead are directed to a highly detailed personal information form, prompted to enter their address, cellphone number and age. If they agree to submit all that, the system still does not steer them to a voter registration page. Instead, it shows them a \"thank you\" page. So that person who wanted help registering to vote? In the end, they got no help at all registering. But they did hand over priceless personal data to a political operation. Specifically, a political action committee created by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, one aimed at giving the Republican presidential nominee Trump an advantage in his campaign against Vice President Kamala Harris, the de facto Democratic nominee. \"I have created a PAC, or a super PAC ... the America PAC,\" Musk said in a recent interview. Musk also owns the social media platform X, and has a net worth of more than $235 billion, according to Forbes. The combination of owning a social media company that gives him an enormous platform to push his political views, and creating a PAC with effectively unlimited resources, has made Musk, for the first time, a major force in an American presidential election.\n\nMusk PAC uses 'register to vote' data\n\nThe America PAC has spent more than $800,000 since early July on digital ads that target voters in the key battleground states of Arizona, Michigan, Georgia, North Carolina, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, according to AdImpact. The ads appeared on Facebook, Instagram and Google through YouTube, and many encouraged people to register to vote at America PAC's website. The PAC's effort to collect information from people using the idea of \"voter registration\" is a critical piece to its plan to make personal contact with these voters. \"America PAC is focusing on door-to-door canvassing in support of Trump,\" said Brendan Fischer, a deputy executive director at campaign finance watchdog Documented. \"I think it is safe to assume that the voter data gathered through these digital appeals are going to inform America PAC's canvassing and other political activities,\" he added. Fischer pointed to the group's privacy policy which says it can use the data they've collected on \"other activities and/or fundraising campaigns.\" Since June, America PAC has spent more than $21 million on canvassing, digital media, text message services and phone calls, according to Federal Election Commission filings. The PAC's website offers no indication one way or another what the group's political leaning is. But in its federal filings, the group discloses that all of its work is designed to either help Trump or hurt his opponent. Fischer said he has seen some other PACs try to use a \"register to vote\" message to gather people's data. But what is unique about America PAC's project is who is backing it and the timing of its creation. In most cases, super PACs are not allowed to directly coordinate the ads they pay for with the campaign. But this spring, regulators ruled that door-to-door canvassing falls outside the scope of the ban because, unlike an ad, it is a person-to-person exchange. \"What makes America PAC more unique: it is a billionaire-backed super PAC focused on door-to-door canvassing, which it can conduct in coordination with a presidential campaign,\" Fischer said. \"Thanks to a recent FEC advisory opinion, America PAC may legally coordinate its canvassing activities with the Trump campaign \u2014 meaning, among other things, that the Trump campaign may provide America PAC with the literature and scripts to make sure their efforts are consistent.\" \"Coordination is incredibly important: it ensures that the PAC's activities are maximally beneficial to the campaign, and frees up the campaign's own funds for other uses,\" he said. \"I suspect that the PAC's ability to coordinate its data-driven canvassing activities with the Trump campaign made it very appealing for donors.\" Longtime Republican strategists Phil Cox, Generra Peck and Dave Rexrode are among those now guiding the PAC after a shake-up in mid-July, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. This person was granted anonymity to speak freely about a private matter. The change suggests there could be a shift in tactics by the PAC come November. The New York Times first reported on the moves.\n\nMusk is not the only tech executive backing this effort. The America PAC raised more than $8 million between April 1 and June 30, according to FEC records. It has received donations from veteran investor Doug Leone, cryptocurrency investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, and a company run by longtime venture capitalist Joe Lonsdale, according to FEC records. Lonsdale, a co-founder of the software company Palantir, is also a leader of the PAC, and \"serves as a political confidant to\" Musk, according to the Times. The records do not yet list Musk as a donor. He recently said on X that he is \"making some donations to America PAC,\" but did not say how much. The PAC is not required to file a third-quarter report until Oct. 15, the first time that Musk's name could be listed as a donor. A spokesman for America PAC declined to comment. Musk did not return emails seeking comment.\n\nMusk on X mirrors Musk PAC",

        "text": "August 4, 2024, presidential campaign news\nIndependent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. attends a press conference in New York on May 1. Eduardo Munoz/Reuters\n\nIndependent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said in a video posted to social media on Sunday that he once drove a dead bear cub carcass from upstate New York and placed it in New York\u2019s Central Park 10 years ago. Kennedy also said the New Yorker had contacted his campaign about the incident for an upcoming article.\n\nIn the video, posted to his X account, Kennedy tells actress Roseanne Barr that he was traveling through New York\u2019s Hudson Valley to go hawking and came across a \u201cyoung bear\u201d that had been hit and killed by another driver. He says in the video he decided to put the dead bear in his car.\n\n\u201cI pulled over and I picked up the bear and put him in the back of my van because I was gonna skin the bear,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was in very good condition and I was gonna put the meat in my refrigerator.\u201d\n\nKennedy then tells Barr that he spent the day hawking before driving to New York City for a dinner with the bear still in his car. At the end of the dinner, Kennedy said, he had to go to the airport and couldn\u2019t take the bear back to his home. He said he broached the idea to friends of taking the bear to Central Park and making it appear as if a biker had hit it.\n\n\u201cI had an old bike in my car that somebody had asked me to get rid of and I said let\u2019s go put the bear in Central Park and we\u2019ll make it look like he got hit by a bike,\u201d Kennedy says in the video, prompting laughs from Barr and others in the room not visible in the video. \u201cEverybody thought, \u2018That\u2019s a great idea.\u2019 So we did that and we thought it would be amusing for whoever found it or something.\u201d\n\nKennedy said the bear\u2019s discovery appeared on \u201cthe front page of every paper,\u201d drawing media coverage and prompting investigations from law enforcement, which he said \u201cworried\u201d him because he\u2019d left behind fingerprints. Kennedy suggested he was not blamed for the incident at the time.\n\n\u201cLuckily, the story died down after a while and it stayed dead for a decade. The New Yorker somehow found out about it, and they just \u2013 they\u2019re gonna do a big article on me and that\u2019s one of the articles. So they asked me, the fact checkers\u201d he said.\n\nKennedy appeared to acknowledge the upcoming story may portray him in a negative light.\n\n\u201cYou know, it\u2019s gonna be a bad story,\u201d he said while laughing.\n\nSome of the details Kennedy describes in the video appear to align with an October 2014 incident in which a dead bear cub was discovered in Central Park, attracting media coverage from major news outlets around the country. The woman who discovered the bear told reporters at the time that she found it with its head resting on a bike.",

        "text": "ABC host reportedly received death threats after Trump interview\nABC News\u2019s senior congressional correspondent, Rachel Scott, has reportedly faced threats to her life after her piercing interview of Donald Trump at the National Association of Black Journalists convention left the former president fuming.\n\nThe NABJ\u2019s executive director told members at a meeting on Saturday that \u201cScott had received death threats following her work asking incisive questions of \u2026 Trump at the group\u2019s national convention\u201d three days earlier, Eric Deggans of National Public Radio wrote in an X post published Saturday.\n\nDeggans did not elaborate, and the Guardian has asked the NABJ, ABC and Scott for comment.\n\nScott asked Trump on Wednesday, \u201cWhy should Black voters trust you?\u201d given his history of inflammatory comments about Black people. Among other questions, she also quizzed him about whether he believed Vice-President Kamala Harris had risen to the top of the Democratic ticket for November\u2019s White House election solely \u201cbecause she is a Black woman\u201d.\n\nTrump replied to Scott by accusing her of being \u201crude\u201d and having presented a \u201cnasty question\u201d. In reference to Harris, who is of Jamaican and Indian descent, he said: \u201cI didn\u2019t know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black. And now she wants to be known as Black.\n\n\u201cSo, I don\u2019t know. Is she Indian, or is she Black?\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s comments about Harris drew widespread derision at a time when polls, including one on Sunday from CBS News, show the pair essentially tied in key battleground states. Notably, on Sunday, Senator Lindsey Graham \u2013 one of Trump\u2019s fellow prominent Republicans \u2013 urged him to focus on condemning her policies rather than her heritage.\n\n\u201cEvery day we\u2019re talking about her heritage and not her \u2026 record \u2026 is a good day for her and a bad day for us,\u201d Graham said on Fox News Sunday.\n\nScott\u2019s encounter with Trump added to the former president\u2019s long record of hostility toward reporters. Frequently, he excoriates journalists as unpatriotic enemies of the people, uses his lectern as a platform from which to hurl insults at the press and singles out reporters by name as purveyors of \u201cfake news\u201d \u2013 often in the presence of an irate mob of supporters.\n\nSome in his circle even blamed the failed 13 July assassination attempt targeting Trump on news coverage that was critical of the former president, who just in May was convicted in criminal court of falsifying business records to hide hush-money payments to adult film actor Stormy Daniels.\n\nUnited Nations experts have previously warned that such vitriol from Trump and his supporters \u2013 hundreds of whom attacked the US Capitol after he lost the 2020 presidential election to Joe Biden \u2013 enhances the possibilities of violence against the press.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Stakes \u2014 Presidential Transition Free newsletter We will guide you through the aftermath of the US election and the transition to a Trump presidency Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the Washington Post\u2019s Karen Attiah resigned from her position as co-chairperson of the convention\u2019s organizing committee in protest of having Trump address the gathering.\n\nScott moderated Trump\u2019s session on Wednesday at the NABJ convention with co-moderators Harris Faulkner of Fox News and Kadia Goba of Semafor.",

        "text": "2024 US President Election: Donald Trump vs Kamala Harris debate on September 10. What we know so far\n2024 US Presidential Election: Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump proposed debating Democratic candidate and US Vice President Kamala Harris on September 4 on Fox News. However, the Harris campaign claimed that Trump was trying to back out from the debate scheduled on ABC News.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social, Trump said the debate rules would be similar to the first with President Joe Biden, who has dropped his candidature from the presidential race. But this time, the debate would take place in the battleground of Pennsylvania with a \u201cfull arena audience\u201d, he said.\n\nDonald Trump vs Kamala Harris: What we know so far 1) The second debate between Trump and Biden was scheduled on September 10 on ABC News, but the former US President suggested it move to Fox News. On Friday, Kamala Harris secured her Democratic nomination for the presidential race.\n\n2) After Donald Trump announced the debate, Harris took to X (formerly Twitter) and wrote, \u201cIt\u2019s interesting how 'any time, any place' becomes \u2018one specific time, one specific safe space\u2019. I\u2019ll be there on Sept. 10, like he agreed to. I hope to see him there.\u201d\n\n3) Trump is running scared and that her campaign is happy to discuss further debates after the September 10 one that both campaigns have already agreed to, said Harris spokesperson Michael Tyler.\n\n4) On the other hand, Trump said Harris is afraid to do it. \u201cI will see her on Sept. 4 or I won't see her at all,\u201d he wrote on Truth Social.\n\nAlso Read | US Elections 2024: Trump agrees to Fox News debate with Harris on September 4\n\n5) Trump suggested moving the debate to Fox shortly after the Democratic National Committee released an ad campaign on Friday. The ad taunted him, labeling him a \"convicted felon afraid to debate\" and speculating that it might be due to his position on abortion.\n\n6) \u201cNow, he seems only comfortable in a cocoon, asking his happy place Fox to host a Trump rally and call it a debate. Maybe he can only handle debating someone his own age,\u201d said David Plouffe, an adviser to former President Barack Obama who recently joined the Harris campaign, posted on social media.",

Carter\u2019s 100th birthday will fall on 1 October.\n\nA Democrat who was in the White House from 1977 to 1981, Carter is the oldest living president. In ill health for several years, his family announced that he entered hospice care on 18 February 2023. Many took that announcement to mean Carter was near the end of his life.\n\nAnd the next month, the current president, Joe Biden, said he had been asked to deliver Carter\u2019s eulogy.\n\nBiden also said Carter\u2019s doctors had \u201cfound a way to keep him going for a lot longer than they anticipated because they found a breakthrough\u201d.\n\nIn October 2023, as the White House celebrated Carter\u2019s 99th birthday, the former Democratic National Committee chairperson Donna Brazile said the former Georgia governor was \u201ca towering, old southern oak \u2026 as good as they come and tough as they come\u201d.\n\nThe following month, Carter\u2019s wife, Rosalynn Carter, died aged 96. The couple, who campaigned for human rights and mental health reform, were married for 77 years, through Jimmy Carter\u2019s time in the US navy, in Georgia state politics, in the White House and in a post-presidency widely regarded as one of the most productive.\n\nIn 2002, Carter was awarded the Nobel peace prize, \u201cfor his decades of untiring effort to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights, and to promote economic and social development\u201d.\n\nIn 2021, he told the Associated Press the secret to a long life was \u201cto marry the right person\u201d.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Stakes \u2014 Presidential Transition Free newsletter We will guide you through the aftermath of the US election and the transition to a Trump presidency Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Jimmy Carter expressed his support for Harris when Chip Carter asked if he was trying to make it to 100.\n\nAs the Journal-Constitution noted, early voting in Georgia begins on 15 October \u2013 two weeks past the former president\u2019s centenarian birthday.",

He has pleaded not guilty to those charges. A trial is scheduled for Sept. 5 in Los Angeles.\n\n{With inputs from wires}",

        "text": "At the Crossroads: The U.S. Presidential Election and the Future of the Auto Industry\nAt the Crossroads: The U.S. Presidential Election and the Future of the Auto Industry\n\nUncertainties loom about the future of electric vehicles (EVs) versus internal combustion engines (ICEs), investment strategies, policy changes, and foreign investments.\n\n\n\nAs the U.S. presidential election looms this November, the domestic auto industry stands at a crucial crossroads, facing uncertainties about the future of electric vehicles (EVs) versus internal combustion engines (ICEs) and the impact of foreign investments. Foreign automakers are also closely monitoring potential new tariff regimes that could disrupt global supply chains, alter trade dynamics, and affect strategic plans.\n\nLegislative Impacts and Investment Strategies\n\nIn recent years, the U.S. automotive sector has been significantly shaped by legislation like the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), and the CHIPS and Science Act. These acts, introduced by the Biden administration, have driven substantial investments in infrastructure expansion, semiconductor capacity building, and clean energy initiatives. A Democratic victory under Kamala Harris would likely continue these targeted investments and subsidies, focusing on transitioning to a green economy. A key component of this transition is sustainable transport, emphasizing EVs, related charging networks, and battery manufacturing facilities.\n\nIncentives aimed at boosting domestic semiconductor manufacturing capabilities have been driven by the need to reduce reliance on Asia-based chip manufacturers. Both Republican and Democratic administrations are expected to support these initiatives, though Republicans might favor U.S. companies like Micron and Intel over East Asian manufacturers like TSMC and Samsung, which have collectively invested around $36 billion in U.S. projects.\n\nDiverging Paths\n\nA Trump administration, known for its climate change skepticism and support for traditional ICEs, could slash funding for clean energy initiatives, jeopardizing the progress of the EV sector. Trump has criticized the current administration\u2019s support for EVs, labeling it a \u201cgreen scam\u201d detrimental to the ICE-focused U.S. auto industry. He has declared his intention to \u201cend the electric vehicle mandate\u201d and roll back policies such as the $7,500 purchase subsidies that support EV adoption. Limiting or ending these subsidies would significantly hinder EV sales at a time when they are struggling to gain a foothold in the U.S. market.\n\nAdditionally, Trump has threatened to impose a 100% tariff on all cars from Chinese-owned manufacturing facilities, regardless of their location. While this aligns with his \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d slogan, it could exacerbate inflationary pressures on U.S. consumers, discouraging them from purchasing higher-priced, domestically made models.\n\nA Republican administration is also poised to ease fuel economy and emissions compliance regulations and challenge roadmaps like California\u2019s, which aim to phase out ICEs and mandate that all new cars and light trucks sold by 2035 be electric or plug-in hybrid. This would slow the transition from ICE to hybrids, battery EVs, and plug-in EVs. Conversely, a Democratic president would likely continue to support EV production and adoption, enforce stricter fuel economy standards, invest in charging networks, and offer tax credits and incentives to make EVs more affordable. Such policies aim to achieve the target of 50% of all new car sales in the U.S. being EVs by 2030.\n\nThe Biden administration\u2019s push for clean energy and job creation has attracted significant foreign investments, including Toyota\u2019s $8 billion plant in North Carolina and Hyundai\u2019s $4 billion project in Georgia. Several states, including Michigan, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Texas, Nevada, and Tennessee, have benefited from new investments in clean energy initiatives. Any attempt by a Trump administration to repudiate these initiatives would harm investment stimulus and job creation, likely facing resistance from these states.\n\nThe Chinese Factor\n\nTariffs on imported vehicles and automotive parts will be a cornerstone of Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda. These tariffs aim to boost domestic manufacturing, protect U.S. automakers from foreign competition, create jobs, and strengthen the U.S. economy. However, this could backfire by increasing production costs for automakers reliant on imported components, leading to higher vehicle prices and dampening consumer demand.\n\nTrade tensions with China remain a significant challenge. President Biden increased tariffs from 25% to 100% on Chinese EVs, raised levies on lithium-ion EV batteries from 7.5% to 25%, and doubled tariffs on semiconductors from 25% to 50%. Although these restrictions, effective August 1st, impact only about $18 billion of Chinese exports to the U.S., a Democratic president is likely to maintain a protectionist stance, especially towards China.\n\nChinese automakers like BYD are seeking to bypass tariffs by establishing facilities in Mexico, raising questions about the USMCA trade agreement, which is up for renewal in 2026. Notably, Democratic nominee Kamala Harris received the endorsement of the United Auto Workers (UAW) Union, partly due to her opposition to the USMCA trade deal.\n\nAt the recent Republican Convention in Milwaukee, Trump expressed a willingness to allow Chinese automakers to build cars in the U.S. and employ American workers, a departure from the Biden administration\u2019s exclusionary stance on vehicles with ties to China. For instance, companies with at least 1/4th Chinese government ownership are considered \u201cforeign entities of concern\u201d and tax credit benefits are disallowed for them. However, Trump warned that if Chinese manufacturers built in Mexico and shipped products across the border, a 200% tax would be imposed. This development bears watching, as it could accelerate the U.S. transition to EVs and provide an entry point for Chinese manufacturers into the market.\n\nBeyond China, Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on trade partners like the EU, potentially resulting in reciprocal tariffs that could harm the competitiveness of U.S. vehicle and parts exports. This could create challenges for U.S. automakers operating in global markets.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs the world awaits the outcome of the U.S. presidential election, the auto industry faces a period of uncertainty. Policy changes could affect product development, sourcing strategies, and investment roadmaps. Both Democrats and Republicans are expected to use economic intervention and tariffs to protect U.S. automotive manufacturing interests from foreign competition. Domestic semiconductor production will receive strong support from both parties. While Democrats will push forward on sustainable EVs and stricter emissions standards, Republicans under Trump will favor conventional fossil fuel-driven cars and eschew fuel economy regulations. Continued investments will be crucial to ensuring the U.S. automotive industry remains competitive on the global stage.\n\nWith inputs from Amrita Shetty, Senior Manager, Communications & Content \u2013 Mobility\n\nAbout Vishwas Shankar Vishwas Shankar is a Director with Frost & Sullivan's Mobility Practice.

        "text": "Despite security concerns, TikTok still plays key role in 2024 race\nDespite national security concerns about TikTok \u2013 and its ties to China \u2013 the popular short-form video app is playing an important role on the campaign trail for both former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. The reason, experts say, is because the platform remains a crucial tool for candidates to reach young voters.\n\nTrump joined TikTok in June, where he currently has 9.5 million followers on the platform, more than the 7.47 million followers on his own social media service, Truth Social.\n\nCapitalizing on a sudden surge in popularity on the platform, Harris created a TikTok account on July 25. Harris has amassed more than 4.1 million followers.\n\nOn both of their respective TikTok profiles, the candidates have adopted a unique TikTok style of campaigning, making use of popular background music, editing methods, and collaborations with popular celebrities.\n\nYoung voters\n\n\u201cA huge part of the reason why Joe Biden left the race is because voters thought he was out of touch, he was too old,\u201d said Caitlin Chin-Rothmann, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who researches the impact of technology on geopolitics. \u201cAnd so, I think both Trump and Harris are trying to position themselves as very relevant, especially when it comes to that younger demographic that's harder to reach in general.\u201d\n\nIn one recent 8-second video, Harris is shown shaking hands with members of the USA Men\u2019s Olympic basketball team to the sound of a screaming eagle and the buzz of an electric guitar. Twenty-nine-year-old rapper Megan Thee Stallion calls Harris \u201cthe future president of the United States\u201d in another video on the candidate\u2019s account.\n\nTrump has made videos with famous YouTuber brothers-turned-boxers Jake and Logan Paul, simulating pre-fight confrontations before breaking to hug each of the influencers. The video he filmed with Logan Paul has more than 157 million views.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna save TikTok,\u201d Trump says to the camera while holding a framed portrait of himself. In another video with famous UFC commentator Dana White, Trump describes joining TikTok as his honor.\n\nBeijing backed\n\nTikTok was adapted for overseas use by a Chinese social media platform owned by Beijing-based company ByteDance. Over one-third of American adults, and 62% of adults under 30, reportedly use TikTok, according to a survey from the Pew Research Center.\n\nWhile he was president, Trump issued an executive order attempting to ban TikTok and WeChat, describing the Chinese-originated apps as a threat to American national security given that data collection on the platforms \u201cthreatens to allow the Chinese Communist Party access to Americans\u2019 personal and proprietary information.\u201d\n\nHowever, in an interview with CNBC in March, Trump said that while he still believes TikTok to be a national security threat, he understands that, if it were banned, a lot of young kids would \u201cgo crazy without it.\u201d\n\nThe former president also argued that a TikTok ban would ultimately benefit Facebook, which he described as \u201can enemy of the people.\u201d After the January 6th Capitol riots, Meta suspended Trump\u2019s Facebook and Instagram accounts for two years.\n\nCiting similar concerns to Trump\u2019s, President Biden approved a bill in April that requires parent company ByteDance to sell the app to remain in the U.S. market. TikTok said it has not and will not share U.S. user data with the Chinese government and has been releasing a series of slick advertisements over the past year as the debate over its ownership has intensified, highlighting the benefit that TikTok provides to American citizens.\n\nUpper hand\n\nArthur Herman, senior fellow and director of the Quantum Alliance Initiative at Hudson Institute, told VOA that although Trump\u2019s and Harris\u2019 decisions to campaign on TikTok are rational given the popularity of the app, American politicking occurring on a Chinese platform gives the Chinese government an upper hand.\n\nHe said that TikTok, which is under the control of the Chinese government, will use its algorithm to influence the election results and \u201cpush one [candidate] who is probably going to be softer on China.\u201d\n\nTikTok denies allegations that it is trying to carry out covert influence operations and has sued the federal government over the law that is forcing it to cut ties with its parent company to keep operating in the United States.\n\nIn May, just a few weeks after the Brookings Institution released a study that said Russian state-media were boosting their use of the platform, the company said it was putting new regulations in place. Those regulations aimed to limit the reach of state media accounts. The company also pledged to release regular updates on what the platform is doing to fight back against covert influence.\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nBiden\u2019s withdrawal from the race has left questions regarding the future of TikTok in the United States. Experts argue that even though TikTok\u2019s fate is ultimately left up to the courts, a future president could try to revoke the ban or change the U.S. position toward Chinese companies.\n\n\u201cNo matter who wins the election in November, whether that's Trump or Harris, they don't have to take responsibility for the TikTok ban. Now they can say \u2018that was Biden\u2019s policy, not mine,\u2019\u201d Chin-Rothmann said.\n\nHerman is optimistic that the next president will continue to take actions against TikTok and ByteDance, and expressed hope that the United States will develop an \u201cAmerican version of TikTok.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe most important next step is that we need an American TikTok. Let's figure out a way in which to develop that and to turn America into high-tech leadership,\u201d Herman said. He added that is where the real future lies.\n\nKatherine Michaelson contributed to this report.",

        "text": "Warning signs of US recession may be bad news for Kamala Harris\nDonald Trump\u2019s message to US voters has been consistent as he seeks to win a second term in the White House: the economy under Joe Biden has been a disaster.\n\nUntil recently the hard data has not supported Trump\u2019s argument. The US has been comfortably the fastest-growing of the G7 leading industrial nations since the Covid pandemic. Unemployment has been low by historic standards. America\u2019s self-sufficiency in energy meant it suffered a less severe inflation shock than Europe after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nYet the former US president now has some evidence to back up his case. The latest set of US jobs figures, released last week, showed the labour market cooling fast. Payroll growth in July slowed to 114,000 \u2013 about half the average of 215,000 in the previous 12 months and well below economists\u2019 expectations. The unemployment rate rose from 4.1% to 4.3%.\n\nThat set alarm bells ringing. Financial markets have been betting heavily on the US economy being able to shrug off the impact of higher interest rates. The latest GDP figures \u2013 showing annual growth of close to 3% \u2013 supported that view.\n\nBut the cracks in the labour market prompted fears that the economy might now be heading for a hard landing. The 12% drop in Japan\u2019s Nikkei index was in large part driven by concerns that the world\u2019s biggest economy might be cooling fast.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has a rule of thumb measure \u2013 known as the Sahm rule \u2013 for gauging whether the US economy is in recession. Named after the economist Claudia Sahm, this states that when the three-month moving average of the US unemployment rate is 0.5 percentage points or more above its low over the prior 12 months, the economy is in the early months of recession.\n\nLast week\u2019s jobless report from the Bureau of Labour Statistics showed the Sahm rule was on the brink of being triggered. As the consultancy Capital Economics pointed out, the rule will be met next month unless the unemployment rate falls back.\n\nHistorically, the Sahm rule has been a good predictor of looming US recessions, and it has been quoted widely in recent days by those arguing that the Federal Reserve has left it too long to cut interest rates. There has been speculation that, having fallen \u201cbehind the curve\u201d, the Fed may not even wait until its next scheduled meeting next month, and may announce an emergency cut in the coming days.\n\nSome economists warn against putting too much store by the Sahm rule. Dhaval Joshi, an analyst at BCA Research, said: \u201cA decoupling between robust growth in the economy and steadily rising unemployment is unprecedented in our lifetimes. Through the past 60 years, whenever the US unemployment rate has increased by 0.5% in a year, taking it to the cusp of recession, GDP growth has also been on the cusp of recession. That is, until now.\u201d\n\nJoshi said unemployment was rising not because of widespread layoffs but because labour supply had been increasing faster than labour demand. The stock market looked more vulnerable to a recession than the real economy. Tech stocks, in particular those exposed to the artificial intelligence boom, have been among the heaviest fallers.\n\n\u201cRight now, if we should fear a US recession, the question is: a recession in what? As in 2000-01, the biggest risk is a severe recession in the frothy parts of the stock market,\u201d said Joshi.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There are other warning signs for Kamala Harris as she seeks to fend off Trump\u2019s attacks on the current administration\u2019s economic record.\n\nThe performance of the delivery company UPS is often seen as a gauge of how well the US economy is doing. Last month it failed to meet analysts\u2019 estimates and pared back its growth forecasts for the rest of 2024.\n\nWith the presidential election only three months away, the economy is not about to plunge into immediate recession. But signs that households are reining in their spending is bad news for the Democrat presidential hopeful.",

        "text": "US Supreme Court refuses to halt Trump\u2019s hush-money sentencing\nThe decision came in response to a lawsuit by the state of Missouri claiming that the case infringed on voters\u2019 rights.\n\nThe US Supreme Court has declined to halt Donald Trump\u2018s upcoming sentencing for his conviction in state court in New York on felony charges involving hush money paid to a porn star and a related gag order until after the upcoming presidential election.\n\nMonday\u2019s decision by the justices has come in response to a lawsuit by the state of Missouri claiming that the case against Trump infringed on the right of voters under the US Constitution to hear from the Republican presidential nominee as he seeks to regain the White House.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s order was unsigned.\n\nConservative Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito indicated they would have allowed Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, a Republican, to file the suit, though not grant his push to quickly lift the gag order and delay sentencing.\n\nBailey argued that the New York gag order, which Missouri wanted stayed until after the election, wrongly limits what the GOP presidential nominee can say on the campaign trail around the country, and Trump\u2019s eventual sentence could affect his ability to travel.\n\n\u201cThe actions by New York have created constitutional harms that threaten to infringe the rights of Missouri\u2019s voters and electors,\u201d he wrote.\n\nWhile the Supreme Court typically hears appeals, it can act as a trial court in state conflicts.\n\nDemocratic New York Attorney General Letitia James argued that appeals are moving through state courts and there\u2019s no state-on-state conflict that would allow the Supreme Court to weigh in at this point.\n\n\u201cAllowing Missouri to file this suit for such relief against New York would permit an extraordinary and dangerous end-run around former President Trump\u2019s ongoing state court proceedings,\u201d she wrote.\n\nTrump was found guilty in May of falsifying business records to cover up a $130,000 payment to porn star Stormy Daniels in exchange for her silence before the 2016 US election about a sexual encounter she has said she had with Trump.\n\nProsecutors have said the payment was designed to boost his presidential campaign in 2016, when he defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrump, the Republican candidate in this year\u2019s election, denies having had sex with Daniels and has vowed to appeal his conviction after his sentencing, scheduled for September.\n\nHe is also trying to have the conviction overturned, pointing to the July Supreme Court ruling that gave him broad immunity from prosecution as a former president. That finding all but ended the possibility that he could face trial on election interference charges in Washington before the election.\n\nThe high court has rejected other similar suits framed as a conflict between states in recent years, including over the 2020 presidential election results.",

        "text": "Kamala Harris is now Democratic presidential nominee, will face off against Donald Trump this fall\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Vice President Kamala Harris, a daughter of immigrants who rose through the California political and law enforcement ranks to become the first female vice president in U.S. history, formally secured the Democratic presidential nomination on Monday \u2014 becoming the first woman of color to lead a major party ticket.\n\nMore than four years after her first attempt at the presidency collapsed, Harris\u2019 coronation as her party\u2019s standard-bearer caps a tumultuous and frenetic period for Democrats prompted by President Joe Biden\u2019s disastrous June debate performance that shattered his own supporters\u2019 confidence in his reelection prospects and spurred extraordinary intraparty warfare about whether he should stay in the race.\n\nJust as soon as Biden abruptly ended his candidacy, Harris and her team worked rapidly to secure backing from the 1,976 party delegates needed to clinch the nomination in a formal roll call vote. She reached that marker at warp speed, with an Associated Press survey of delegates nationwide showing she locked down the necessary commitments a mere 32 hours after Biden\u2019s announcement.\n\nHarris\u2019 nomination became official after a five-day round of online balloting by Democratic National Convention delegates ended Monday night, with the party saying in a statement released just before midnight that 99% of delegates casting ballots had done so for Harris. The party had long contemplated the early virtual roll call to ensure Biden would appear on the ballot in every state. It said it would next formally certify the vote before holding a celebratory roll call at the party\u2019s convention later this month in Chicago.\n\nAn Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll conducted after Biden withdrew found 46% of Americans have a favorable view of Harris, while a nearly identical share has an unfavorable view of her. But more Democrats say they are satisfied with her candidacy compared with that of Biden, energizing a party that had long been resigned to the 81-year-old Biden being its nominee against former President Donald Trump, a Republican they view as an existential threat.\n\nAlready Harris has telegraphed that she doesn\u2019t plan to veer much from the themes and policies that framed Biden\u2019s candidacy, such as democracy, gun violence prevention and abortion rights. But her delivery can be far fierier, particularly when she invokes her prosecutorial background to lambast Trump and his 34 felony convictions for falsifying business records in connection with a hush money scheme.\n\n\u201cGiven that unique voice of a new generation, of a prosecutor and a woman when fundamental rights, especially reproductive rights, are on the line, it\u2019s almost as if the stars have aligned for her at this moment in history,\u201d said Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla of California, who was tapped to succeed Harris in the Senate when she became vice president.\n\nA splash in Washington before a collapse in the 2020 primaries\n\nKamala Devi Harris was born Oct. 20, 1964, in Oakland, California, to Shyamala Gopalan, a breast cancer scientist who emigrated to the United States from India when she was 19 years old, and Stanford University emeritus professor Donald Harris, a naturalized U.S. citizen originally from Jamaica. Her parents\u2019 advocacy for civil rights gave her what she described as a \u201cstroller\u2019s-eye view\u201d of the movement.\n\nShe spent years as a prosecutor in the Bay Area before her elevation as the state\u2019s attorney general in 2010 and then election as U.S. senator in 2016.\n\nHarris was sworn in as San Francisco\u2019s district attorney with her mother Dr. Shyamala Gopalan holding a copy of The Bill of Rights in January 2004.

Securing a spot on the coveted Judiciary Committee gave her a national spotlight to interrogate prominent Trump nominees, such as now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not able to be rushed this fast,\u201d then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions said during a 2017 hearing as Harris repeatedly pressed him on potential conversations with Russian nationals. \u201cIt makes me nervous.\u201d\n\nHarris questions Sessions as he testifies before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence on June 13, 2017.

But Harris withdrew from the primary race before the first nominating contest in Iowa, plagued by staff dissent that spilled out into the open and an inability to attract enough campaign cash.\n\nHarris struggled to deliver a consistent pitch to Democratic voters and wobbled on key issues such as health care. She suggested she backed eliminating private insurance for a full government-run system \u2014 \u201cMedicare for All\u201d coverage \u2014 before releasing her own health care plan that preserved private insurance. Now, during her nascent general election campaign, Harris has already reversed some of her earlier, more liberal positions, such as a ban on fracking that she endorsed in 2019.\n\nAnd while Harris tried to deploy her law enforcement background as an asset in her 2020 presidential campaign, it never attracted enough support in a party that couldn\u2019t reconcile some of her past tough-on-crime positions at a time of heightened focus on police brutality.\n\nJoining Biden\u2019s team \u2014 and an evolution as vice president\n\nStill, Harris was at the top of the vice presidential shortlist when Biden was pondering his running mate, after his pledge in early 2020 that he would choose a Black woman as his No. 2. He was fond of Harris, who had forged a close friendship with his now-deceased son Beau, who had been Delaware\u2019s attorney general when she was in that job for California.\n\nHer first months as vice president were far from smooth. Biden asked her to lead the administration\u2019s diplomatic efforts with Central America on the root causes of migration to the United States, which triggered attacks from Republicans on border security and remains a political vulnerability. It didn\u2019t help matters that Harris stumbled in big interviews, such as in a 2021 sit-down with NBC News\u2019 Lester Holt when she responded dismissively that \u201cI haven\u2019t been to Europe\u201d when the anchor noted that she hadn\u2019t visited the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nPresident Joe Biden walks with Harris in the Rose Garden of the White House, May 13, 2021, in Washington.

Wade, as she became the chief spokesperson for the administration on abortion rights and was a more natural messenger than Biden, a lifelong Catholic who had in the past favored restrictions on the procedure. She is the first vice president to tour an abortion clinic and speaks about reproductive rights in the broader context of maternal health, especially for Black women.\n\nThroughout her vice presidency, Harris has been careful to remain loyal to Biden while emphasizing that she would be ready to step in if needed. That dramatic transition began in late June after the first debate between Biden and Trump, where the president\u2019s stumbles were so cataclysmic that he could never reverse the loss of confidence from other Democrats.\n\nHeaded to the top of the ticket\n\nAfter Biden ended his candidacy July 21, he quickly endorsed Harris. And during the first two weeks of her 2024 presidential bid, enthusiasm among the Democratic base surged, with donations pouring in, scores of volunteers showing up at field offices and supporters swelling so much in numbers that event organizers have had to swap venues.\n\nThe Harris campaign now believes it has a renewed opportunity to compete in Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina and Georgia \u2014 states that Biden had started to abandon in favor of shoring up the so-called \u201cblue wall\u201d states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.\n\n\u201cThe country is able to see the Kamala Harris that we all know,\u201d said Bakari Sellers, who was a national co-chair of her 2020 campaign. \u201cWe really didn\u2019t allow the country to see her\u201d four years ago. Sellers said: \u201cWe had her in bubble wrap. What people are seeing now is that she\u2019s real, she\u2019s talented.\u201d\n\nHarris speaks during a campaign rally, July 30, 2024, in Atlanta.

Harris has also yet to answer extended questions from journalists nor sit down for a formal interview since she began her run.\n\nThe Trump campaign has been eager to define Harris as she continues to introduce herself to voters nationwide, releasing an ad blaming her for the high number of illegal crossings at the southern border during the Biden administration and dubbing her \u201cFailed. Weak. Dangerously liberal.\u201d\n\nThe Republican nominee\u2019s supporters have also derisively branded Harris as a diversity hire, while Trump himself has engaged in ugly racial attacks of his own, wrongly asserting that Harris had in the past only promoted her Indian heritage and only recently played up her Black identity.\n\nHis remarks are previewing a season of racist and sexist claims against the person who would be the first woman and the first person of South Asian heritage in the presidency.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black and now she wants to be known as Black,\u201d Trump said while addressing the annual convention of the National Association of Black Journalists. \u201cSo, I don\u2019t know, is she Indian or is she Black?\u201d\n\nIn her response, Harris called it \u201cthe same old show \u2014 the divisiveness and the disrespect\u201d and said voters \u201cdeserve better.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe American people deserve a leader who tells the truth, a leader who does not respond with hostility and anger when confronted with the facts,\u201d Harris said at a Sigma Gamma Rho sorority gathering in Houston. \u201cWe deserve a leader who understands that our differences do not divide us.\u201d",

Here are the paths to the presidency\n\nFor more on the 2024 race head to the NPR Network's live updates page.\n\nLoading...\n\nSince President Biden dropped out of the presidential race and the Democratic Party has coalesced around Vice President Harris, the political world has changed.\n\nAfter Biden\u2019s dismal debate performance in late June, swing-state polls showed a small, but significant decline for Biden, enough that Biden bowed out of the race. Since Harris\u2019 entry, though, she has seen a surge across the most competitive states with far more Democratic enthusiasm, but it\u2019s still a very close election, an NPR analysis finds, that could go either way.\n\nRepublican former President Donald Trump currently holds a 268-226 lead over Harris in the latest NPR Electoral Map of the most competitive states (see map above), just short of the 270 needed to win the presidency. Trump had led in the \"Blue Wall\" states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan before Biden exited, but now the states are pure toss-ups.\n\nTrump's leads in the \"Sun Belt\" states of North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada have been sliced in half since Harris got in because of the increased Democratic enthusiasm and her appeal to younger and nonwhite voters. Still, Trump retains small but consistent leads. That could change if Harris continues her momentum, but at this point, they are ever so slightly in the \"lean Republican\" category.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThis analysis is based on more than just polling. It's also informed by reporting from the field, conversations with campaigns and also considers the history of how states have voted in the past. We also include a map strictly based on polling (below). That shows a slightly closer 268-241 Trump lead.\n\nFor the state polling, NPR's analysis is based on surveys aggregated by FiveThirtyEight and DDHQ/The Hill. If a candidate had an average lead in both aggregators of 1 point or more, as of Friday afternoon, it is colored a shade of red for Trump or blue for Harris. If it was less than that, it\u2019s yellow for \"Toss Up.\"\n\n\n\nMap based strictly on polling\n\nThis will change between now and Nov. 5, and the NPR maps will be updated periodically to reflect those changes. But for now this analysis is intended to give a rough overview of where the race currently stands since Harris has gotten in \u2014 and not necessarily where it will be in the end.\n\nLoading...\n\nPaths to the White House\n\nEven though Harris is down in the NPR Election Map, she has more potential paths to 270 than Trump does. Here's a look at how both could get there:\n\n\n\nHarris\n\n1. The Blue Wall: If Harris wins all three Blue Wall states, as well as the one congressional district in the Omaha, Neb., area that Biden won handily in 2020, she would be at 270 without any of the Sun Belt states (provided she wins all of the states that are leaning her direction and is currently leading). It's her easiest path to the White House, and because of that, these Blue Wall states are a key focus of the Harris campaign. It's also why there has been such a focus on Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro as a potential Harris running mate.\n\n2. The Sun Belt options: If Harris is able to win one or multiple Sun Belt states, she could make up for deficiencies in the Blue Wall. Her campaign is optimistic that she could turn the tide in the Sun Belt and points out that it has seen an uptick in not just donations, but volunteers in these states.\n\nTrump\n\n1. Pennsylvania and Georgia are must-wins: It's become clear that the Trump campaign views these two states as places it has to win. Just look at its ad spending. Since Super Tuesday, Trump and his allies have spent 77% of all their ad money in these two states \u2014 $50 million in Pennsylvania and $16 million in Georgia, according to data from AdImpact analyzed by NPR.\n\nWhy are they so important? Trump would get to exactly 270 with these two states and the other states currently leaning in his favor \u2014 without having to win North Carolina, Arizona, Nevada, Wisconsin or Michigan.",

        "text": "Chairman Steil Launches Expanded Investigation into Online Political Donations Through ActBlue\nWASHINGTON - Today, Committee on House Administration Chairman Bryan Steil (WI-01) announced its next phase of oversight into ActBlue's online political donation operation amid concerns that ActBlue is violating or skirting federal campaign finance (FCF) laws. In launching the investigation, Chairman Steil released the following statement:\n\n\n\n\"Illegal and malicious conduct have no place in our elections. Ensuring all parties are complying with federal election law as we approach a presidential election is of utmost importance. By launching a new phase of our investigation into ActBlue, the Committee on House Administration has begun robust oversight of ActBlue's lenient donor verification standards. I'm committed to ensuring Americans can have confidence in our elections and to preventing foreign or malicious actors from influencing American elections.\"\n\n\n\nIn launching the next phase of the investigation, Chairman Steil sent a letter to Federal Election Commission (FEC) Chairman Cooksey and Vice Chair Weintraub requesting the FEC immediately initiate an emergency rulemaking process to require political campaigns verify the card verification value (CVV) of donors who contribute online and a rulemaking to prohibit political committees from accepting online contributions from gift cards or credit and debit cards. In addition to the letter, the Committee has scheduled a briefing with the FEC investigations team set for later this month.\n\n\n\nRead the full text of the letter here.\n\n\n\nIn addition, Chairman Steil's plan includes legislation to:\n\nRequire political committees to verify the CVV and address information of donors that contribute via a credit or debit card,\n\nProhibit political committees from accepting donations from a gift card or other prepaid credit card\n\nRequire political campaigns to get the affirmative consent of donors before they make a reoccuring contribution\n\nBackground:\n\n\n\nIn recent weeks, a wide array of sources have voiced concerns that ActBlue is violating or skirting federal campaign finance laws in several ways including:\n\nLaundering foreign contributions through prepaid gift cards and U.S. credit and debit cardholders.\n\nUsing prepaid giftcards and credit cards as a vehicle without knowledge of the owner to launder campaign contributions that would violate Federal Campaign Finance (FCF) law.\n\nDeliberate nonuse of the CVV number to hinder verification of the owner or location of the credit card holder.\n\nReceipt of a significant number of donations from individuals who are retired and live on a fixed income.\n\nSudden appearance of very large donations from individuals who have previously donated much smaller amounts.\n\nPatterns of hundreds of donations for $2.50 from the same individual.\n\nState Attorney's General from Virginia, Wyoming, and Missouri are conducting similar investigations into ActBlue.\n\nOn September 20, 2023, Chairman Steil held the first full committee hearing with the Federal Election Commission in over a decade.\n\n\n\nOn October 31, 2023 Chairman Steil sent a letter demanding answers on ActBlue's practices, questioning if they are complying with federal campaign finance laws and preventing foreign and illegal contributions.\n\n###",

This year, an unusual connection to the 2024 U.S. presidential contest promises an extraordinary level of interest and opportunity for Augsburg students around the upcoming election.\n\nSince 2019, Minnesota\u2019s First Lady, Gwen Walz, has held appointments as an instructor of education at Augsburg and as a special assistant for strategic partnerships in the Office of the President. At Augsburg, she has helped develop and co-teach a master\u2019s-level education course called \u201cConnecting Policy, Practice, and Advocacy for Educational Equity.\u201d She has worked to build connections between campus programs and state agencies to offer internships and experiential learning opportunities. And she has worked closely with the Provost\u2019s Office to encourage voter participation and democratic engagement.\n\nNow, students who were used to seeing Walz on campus will see her in a different context. On Tuesday, Vice President President Kamala Harris announced Governor Tim Walz as her running mate in the November presidential election.\n\n\u201cGovernor Walz\u2019s selection as the Democratic vice-presidential nominee represents a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for education and engagement around this election cycle,\u201d said Augsburg President Paul C. Pribbenow. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful reminder for our students that whether on a college campus or in our nation\u2019s capital, the hard work of democracy, at its core, is the same: finding ways to come together across difference to work for the common good.\u201d\n\nRead more about Gwen Walz in the March 2023 issue of Augsburg Now.\n\nAbout Augsburg University\n\nAugsburg University offers more than 50 undergraduate majors and 11 graduate degrees to more than 3,100 students of diverse backgrounds at its campus in the vibrant center of the Twin Cities.

Fueling her rise are Black voters, white women with college degrees and women who identify as political independents .",
        "text": "Poll: Harris jumps to a small national lead over Trump\nPoll: Harris jumps to a small national lead over Trump\n\ntoggle caption Andrew Harnik/Getty Images; Bill Pugliano/Getty Images\n\nVice President Harris has upended the presidential race and has now built a 51%-48% lead over former President Trump, according to the latest NPR/PBS News/Marist poll.\n\nThat result is 4 points better than just after Harris got into the race two weeks ago when President Biden bowed out. Harris maintains a 3-point lead (48%-45%) when third-party choices are offered, too.\n\nLoading...\n\nFueling her rise are Black voters, white women with college degrees and women who identify as political independents. She is doing 20 to 30 points better with them than when she first got in, leading to improvement in the suburbs and with white voters overall.\n\nOn the issues, the negative views of the economy are not sticking to Harris the way they did Biden. Trump is still more trusted on the economy, but only by 3 points over Harris (51%-48%), compared to 9 points over Biden (54%-45%) in June.\n\nHarris is also seeing improvement on how she would handle immigration, though Trump is still more trusted on that topic by 6 points (52%-46%). Harris\u2019 best issue is handling abortion rights. She has a 15-point advantage on that.\n\nLoading...\n\nThe survey was conducted from Thursday through Sunday, before Harris picked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her vice-presidential running mate. Marist interviewed 1,613 adults via cellphone, landline and online research panels in English and in Spanish. The survey has a margin of error of +/- 3.3 percentage points, meaning results could be roughly 3 points higher or lower.\n\nWomen, Black voters and independents have all moved toward Harris\n\nBecause of Harris\u2019 gains with certain groups, she\u2019s also improved her standing in the suburbs and with white voters overall.\n\nBut there\u2019s now a 22-point gender gap, which is wider than the margin between Trump and Biden in July. Harris now leads by 13 points with women (55%-42%), but is losing men by 9 points (54%-45%). Considering the margin of error, those are close to the results of the 2020 presidential election, according to exit polls.\n\nHarris\u2019 biggest boost is coming with Black voters. She has gone from a 23-point lead with Black voters over Trump a couple of weeks ago, when many voters moved into the undecided camp, to a 54-point lead now. Harris is moving closer to territory where Democrats need to be with Black voters.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nSome Black voters, who appeared to be considering Trump, have moved away from him, as he\u2019s dropped 10 points with them.\n\nHarris is also now winning independents, something Biden was not doing. Harris is up 9 points with independents (53%-44%). She was down 14 points with them last month. And in early July, Trump was beating Biden by 4 points with the group.\n\nHarris has also improved with white voters overall. Harris has gone from 40% with white voters overall to 46% in this survey, which is closer to where Biden was, and that\u2019s very high for a Democrat. In fact, no Democrat has scored that high with white voters in a presidential election since Jimmy Carter in 1976. Biden got 41% in 2020, Barack Obama in 2008 won 43%.\n\nThat improvement is mostly because of college-educated white women. White voters without degrees, a core Trump base group, are heavily in Trump\u2019s favor and their margin is unchanged. Two-thirds of college-educated white women, though, are now in Harris\u2019 camp, which would be far higher than the percentage that sided with Biden in 2020.\n\nShe\u2019s also winning with older voters. Harris is leading Trump by 11 points with baby boomers (55%-44%), for example.\n\nLatinos have also moved in Harris\u2019 favor. Fifty-eight percent say they would vote for her now, compared to 51% last month. That\u2019s still below the 65% Biden won in 2020.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nHarris is not where she needs to be with voters under 45 at this point. Biden won them in 2020 by 14 points. Harris and Trump right now are tied with the group. Where Harris does far better than Biden with the group, though, is retaining them when third parties are introduced.\n\nBiden was seeing double-digit drop-offs with Gen Z/millennials, for example. Harris, on the other hand, maintains and slightly expands her margin when respondents have a choice of candidates other than the two major-party picks.\n\n\n\nHarris is benefiting from a boost in enthusiasm with core Democratic voter groups\n\nBlack, Latino and younger voters are saying they\u2019re more fired up to vote now that Harris is in the race.\n\nBlack voters, Latinos and Gen Z/millennial voters have all jumped double-digits in saying they\u2019re definitely voting.\n\nIn July, just 71% of Black voters, 68% of Latinos and 65% of Gen Z/millennials said they were definitely voting, among the lowest of any groups.\n\nBut now, that\u2019s up to 81% with Black voters, 84% with Latinos and 80% with Gen Z/millennials, closer to being on par with white voters than in previous surveys.\n\n\n\nThird parties seeing their lowest marks of the election\n\nWith Harris in the race, people appear to be moving away from third parties.\n\nAll of the third-party candidates are seeing their worst scores since Marist started asking about them in April. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., running as an independent, is down to just 5%. Professor Cornel West, also running as an independent, Green Party candidate Jill Stein and Libertarian Chase Oliver are all polling at or below 1%.\n\nKennedy still does best with those who have an unfavorable opinion of both Trump and Harris, pulling in about a third of those voters.\n\n\n\nPeople are split on who they think will win, but far more say Harris will than they said of Biden\n\nLast month, respondents were 20 points more likely to say Trump would beat Biden (59%-39%). Now, they\u2019re split (48%-48%).\n\nSponsor Message\n\nNotably, independents have flipped from 58% thinking Trump would win to 52% now saying they think Harris will.\n\nPeople are also more satisfied with their choices, though only 47% say they are compared to 50% who say they are not. In June, there was a 10-point difference between people satisfied (42%) and those who were dissatisfied with their choices (52%).\n\n\n\nBeing honest and trustworthy is the most important quality for a president\n\nWhile trustworthiness was the most important quality for Democrats and independent voters, a plurality of Republicans said a \u201cstrong leader\u201d was most important to them.\n\n\n\nAll signs continue to point to a close election \u2014 not just in the presidential but also for Congress\n\nForty-seven percent said they want to see Democrats in control of Congress, while 45% said Republicans. That 2-point advantage is unchanged from June.\n\nDemocrats traditionally need a wider advantage in that score to make significant gains \u2014 in 2022, when they denied Republicans from winning a wave of House seats, they had a 4-point edge in the Marist poll; in 2020, it was 8, but Democrats lost House seats; they were +6 in 2018 and made significant gains, however; in 2014, when Republicans won seats, Republicans were +5 on the question.\n\nThe congressional ballot and the change in numbers of seats don\u2019t always correlate cleanly because of where the most competitive seats are that cycle. In this cycle, for example, many are in suburban areas in New York, California and around Philadelphia, where Democrats have advantages in presidential years because of higher turnout among their core voter groups.\n\n\n\nBiden\u2019s approval is up\n\nNow that Biden has dropped out of the race, his approval rating is seeing a bounce.\n\nHis approval is now 46%, which is the highest since February of 2023 and up 5 points since last month.",

        "text": "Polls show Kamala Harris moving ahead of Donald Trump in 2024 US election\nAs Kamala Harris named Tim Walz, the Minnesota governor, as her running mate, recent polls showed the vice-president moving ahead of Donald Trump in the race for the White House.\n\nAmong recent national head-to-head polls, SurveyUSA put Harris up three points ahead of Trump, 48%-45%; Morning Consult put her up four points, 48%-44%; YouGov and CBS News made it a one-point Harris lead, 50%-49%; and University of Massachusetts Amherst put Harris up three, 46%-43%.\n\nThose results were mostly within the margin of error.\n\nBut Tatishe Nteta, provost professor of political science at UMass Amherst and director of its poll, pointed to a key finding: a seven-point swing to the Democrat since January, when Trump led Joe Biden by four.\n\n\u201cFor weeks after the first presidential debate in June,\u201d Nteta said, \u201cDemocratic donors, prominent Democratic elected officials and members of the news media made the case that President Joe Biden faced long odds to defeat former President Donald Trump and called for Biden to step down.\n\n\u201cIn the aftermath of Biden\u2019s historic decision to forgo his re-election campaign, it seems as if Biden\u2019s critics were indeed correct as his replacement, Vice-President Kamala Harris, has emerged as the frontrunner in the race for the White House.\n\n\u201cWhile there are still three months to go, the Harris campaign and the Democratic party must like their chances to maintain control of the White House and to send former President Trump to his second consecutive defeat in his quest to return to Pennsylvania Avenue.\u201d\n\nThere was also good news for Harris from the Hill, as the site\u2019s \u201cultimate hub for polls, predictions and election results\u201d showed the Democrat with a positive favourability rating for the first time, after a steep climb since mid-July, when Biden stepped down.\n\nAs to be expected, August polls in the seven battleground states where the election is expected to be decided presented a more mixed picture.\n\nIn polls concluding in August, Public Policy Polling, a Democratic firm, found Harris up one in Georgia but down two on Trump in Arizona and down one in Pennsylvania. Trafalgar/Insider Advantage, a right-leaning operation, put Trump up two in Georgia.\n\nAccording to battleground averages maintained by the polling site FiveThirtyEight, Trump led Harris by two points in Arizona and one in Georgia, with Harris up by two points Michigan, one in Pennsylvania and one and a half in Wisconsin.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Stakes \u2014 Presidential Transition Free newsletter We will guide you through the aftermath of the US election and the transition to a Trump presidency Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

With Harris in place, Siena College found her up 14 points, 53%-39%.\n\nOn Monday, Nate Silver, founder of FiveThirtyEight and an influential voice among polling analysts, said Harris \u201cnow has a real lead in national polls \u2013 about two points \u2013 and has also been ahead in most recent polls of\u201d Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.\n\nConcerns about economic conditions should not be counted out, Silver said, on a day of Wall Street sell-offs and reports of recession fears. \u201cBut the momentum in the polls outweighs it for now.\u201d",

Gov. Geoff Duncan, former North Carolina Supreme Court Justice Bob Orr, former Mecklenburg County GOP board member Michael Tucker and US Army veteran Scott Peoples addressed their personal reasons for endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris, and what role the newly formed coalition of Republicans and former Republicans will have in the plan to turn the battleground state blue in November.\n\n\u201cUnprecedented times call for unprecedented measures. I\u2019m a Republican, but more importantly, I\u2019m an American. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m here,\u201d said Duncan to start the press conference.\n\n\u201cI am proudly endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris to be the next president of the United States, for a number of reasons. And not many of those are because of all the policies, but because of the person. Because of the adherence to the Constitution and because it\u2019s going to be a stable hand in a time when this country needs a stable hand to get us to the next step,\u201d he added.\n\nOrr, a Republican for 45 years before switching his registration to unaffiliated \u201cafter January 6 and the events that followed,\u201d told the press on the call that \u201cthe stakes are simply too high not to take action.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump failed Republicans. He failed Americans. And he failed our country when he was serving as president. A second Trump term would be an even great danger to our democracy and Constitution than the first,\u201d said Orr, adding that he recently attended a Harris campaign event in Greensboro. \u201cIt could not be more important to ensure that never again in the position to use the office of the presidency for his own personal gain.\u201d\n\nThe Harris campaign has said the coalition will \u201cplay a pivotal role in engaging Trump-skeptical Republican voters across North Carolina, facilitating Republican-to-Republican voter contact, including by hosting Republican-featured events, door knocking, phone banking, spearheading letter-to-the-editor campaigns, and building local networks with Republican organizations, businesses, and community groups.\u201d\n\nTucker said he cast one of the more than 250,000 votes for Nikki Haley in the North Carolina\u2019s Republican primary back in March, and now, he is \u201cactively working to protect America to identify other Republicans who have also been alienated by Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nTucker, Peoples and Orr all acknowledged that many Republicans or Republican-leaning voters in North Carolina likely do not feel comfortable with casting a ballot for a Democrat- or at least, admitting that are doing that.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not alone if you feel this way and you are hearing this, there are other Republicans who feel the same way you do,\u201d said Tucker.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have to step forward like we are. All they have to do is go in that voting booth, in the privacy of that spot, and do the right thing for America. And that is vote for Vice President Harris,\u201d said Orr.",

        "text": "U.S. presidential election: New poll shows Kamala Harris strengthening against Donald Trump\nA new poll confirmed Sunday, August 4, 2024, that Kamala Harris -- set to name her vice presidential pick imminently -- has drawn level with Donald Trump, transforming a White House race that the Republican had been increasingly confident he was going to win.\n\nAs the November 5 election rapidly approaches, Harris has erased the growing lead that Trump was building before President Joe Biden dropped his reelection bid.\n\nAccording to the CBS News/YouGov poll released Sunday, Harris has a one percent advantage on Trump nationwide -- compared to Trump's previous five point edge on Biden.\n\nIn the swing states that decide the Electoral College contest in US elections, Harris and Trump -- who shocked the world with his 2016 presidential victory but was beaten by Biden in 2020 -- are equal.\n\nThese are considered good numbers for a Democratic candidate who parachuted into the race only last month, when Biden bowed to mounting concerns over his mental acuity and ability at 81 years old to serve a second term.\n\nBut Harris, who is Biden's vice president and the first Black and South Asian woman ever in the role, is in a sprint to define herself to voters before Trump does.\n\nA big moment in that process will be when Harris announces her choice for running mate in a historic bid to become America's first female president. This could happen as early as Sunday or Monday.\n\nExpectations are that Harris will pick a white man to balance the ticket -- and likely a moderate Democrat who would help counterweigh attacks on Harris from Republicans that she is too far to the left.\n\nVP shortlist\n\nThe three figures seen as heading the short list -- Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona -- were all visiting Harris in Washington on Sunday, The Washington Post reported.\n\n\"It's her first major decision that she's making as an executive, so it tells you about her thought process,\" Amy Walter, a polling expert from Cook Political Report newsletter, told CBS News.\n\nThe CBS poll, which echoes numerous other surveys indicating rapid gains by Harris, shows that Trump is still favored by voters on the key issue of the economy.\n\nOnly 25 percent said they expected to be better off financially if Harris wins, compared to 45 percent who said so about Trump.\n\nHowever, when it comes to trust in the candidates' temperament, the poll shows voters prefer the former California prosecutor to Trump, a convicted felon who has made a career out of publicly insulting those who oppose him -- including while president.\n\nThe issue of cognitive health, which used to bedevil Biden, is now a liability for 78-year-old Trump, the poll found. Only 51 percent of respondents thought Trump is mentally capable for the presidency, compared to 64 percent for Harris.\n\nThe Democrats believe that if you \"make this referendum on Trump rather than a referendum on the current state of the economy, then we have a real opportunity to win,\" Cook said.\n\nTrump was riding high politically last month after surviving an assassination attempt at a rally, then using the Republican convention to highlight his image of vigor against the physically frail Biden.\n\nBut with Biden's dramatic exit and Harris's fast start, he's scrambling to recalibrate.\n\nAt a rally on Saturday in the swing state of Georgia, Trump called Harris a \"Marxist\" and a \"radical left freak,\" claiming she would cause an \"economic crash.\" On Wednesday, he shocked many when he told an audience of Black journalists that Harris had \"turned Black\" out of political expediency.\n\nWhere Biden often attacked Trump as a threat to democracy, given his unprecedented refusal to accept his loss in 2020, Harris's team has honed a sharper -- more meme-friendly -- line built around branding Trump and his vice presidential pick J.D. Vance \"weird.\"\n\nOn Saturday, the Harris campaign said Trump was \"scared\" to debate her after he turned down a previously scheduled televised debate on ABC, while saying he'd be ready to debate her on Fox News -- a network that has for years given him support.",

        "text": "Poll: Harris boosts confidence that Democrats could win the 2024 election\nMoving Vice President Kamala Harris to the top of the ticket has reinvigorated Democrats\u2019 prospects of winning the White House, according to a new PBS News/NPR/Marist poll.\n\nWeeks ago, many Democrats were losing confidence that their party\u2019s presumptive nominee, President Joe Biden, would be able to defeat former President Donald Trump. Before Biden left the race, 39 percent of Americans \u2013 regardless of who they support \u2013 said he stood a chance at winning the election.\n\nREAD MORE: Here\u2019s how Americans feel about Tim Walz\n\nIn this latest poll, 48 percent of U.S. adults said they think Harris will win, putting her in a dead-heat with Trump. Another 48 percent of Americans said they think he has the best shot of getting elected.\n\n\u201cDemocrats are totally of a different mindset,\u201d said Lee Miringoff, who directs the Marist Institute for Public Opinion. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that the Harris candidacy has unleashed a whole new wave of enthusiasm among Democrats, and in the process has also moved some voters who were either straddling the fence or were in Trump\u2019s column.\u201d\n\nConfidence in Trump\u2019s ability to recapture the presidency has been shaken since a month ago, when 59 percent of voters overall thought he\u2019d win.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a complete flip of a switch,\u201d Republican strategist Olivia Troye said.\n\nCompared to June, more people also report being satisfied with the candidates for the president. In this latest poll, 47 percent of Americans said they were satisfied with who Democrats and Republicans have put forward, marking a 5 percentage-point increase since earlier in the summer. Still, 50 percent of Americans overall say they are dissatisfied with their options.\n\nFor much of his presidential race, Biden struggled to gain momentum among younger voters and voters of color. These latest poll numbers show where Harris has already gained ground and how much further she needs to go to motivate communities to throw their support behind her, Miringoff said.\n\nHarris vs. Trump\n\nIf the election were today, 51 percent of U.S. registered voters said they would support Harris and 48 percent said they would back Trump, a gap that narrowly falls within the margin of error.\n\nHere are more takeaways:\n\nSupport for Harris rose 6 percentage points since Biden announced he would exit the race.\n\nsince Biden announced he would exit the race. Trump saw a 2 percentage-point jump in support since late July.\n\nin support since late July. Democrats, Black voters and white women who graduated from college were most likely to support Harris .\n\n. Republicans, white men who did not graduate from college and white Christian evangelicals were most likely to support Trump.\n\nWhen registered voters were asked to consider a race including third-party candidates like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Harris\u2019 lead over Trump was diminished, falling just within the margin of error.\n\nWith a wider roster to choose from, 48 percent said they would vote for Harris if the election were today.\n\nsaid they would vote for Harris if the election were today. 45 percent said they would back Trump.\n\nsaid they would back Trump. 5 percent of registered voters said they would vote for Kennedy.\n\nSurvey interviews with voters concluded before a news story broke that Kennedy had been involved in leaving a dead black bear cub in New York City\u2019s Central Park.\n\nOn the issues\n\nThe most important quality in a possible president is someone American can trust, according to this latest poll. Overall, 27 percent picked honesty and trustworthiness as an essential characteristic, while 20 percent said they want a strong leader.\n\nIn this poll, Americans also were asked which of the two major party candidates they thought would better manage a series of pressing issues.\n\nOn the economy , 51 percent of Americans said Trump would do a better job of leading, while 48 percent said Harris would be do better.\n\n, 51 percent of Americans said Trump would do a better job of leading, while 48 percent said Harris would be do better. On abortion , 56 percent of Americans said Harris would do a better job managing the issue, while 41 percent said Trump would.\n\n, 56 percent of Americans said Harris would do a better job managing the issue, while 41 percent said Trump would. On immigration, 52 percent of Americans said Trump would handle the issue best, while46 percent said Harris would.\n\nLess than two weeks out from the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents were split over whether Harris should continue to pursue Biden administration policies or plan to forge a new path for the U.S.\n\nForty-eight percent of likely Democratic voters said they want Harris to further build upon the work Biden started, while 49 percent said they want Harris to take the country in a new direction. At the moment, Democrats feel largely united behind their future nominee, but as Miringoff warned, it\u2019s too soon to \u201cstart measuring the windows for curtains in the White House.\u201d\n\nPBS News, NPR and Marist Poll conducted a survey on Aug. 1 through 4 that polled 1,613 U.S. adults with a margin of error of 3.3 percentage points, 1,513 registered voters with a margin of error of 3.4 percentage points, 1,309 registered voters who definitely plan to vote in November\u2019s general election with a margin of error of 3.7 percentage points and 717 Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents with a margin of error of 4.9 percentage points.",

        "text": "Five things to know about Tim Walz\n\u25b6 Follow AP\u2019s live coverage of the 2024 election\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 Vice President Kamala Harris has decided on Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate in her bid for the White House. The 60-year-old Democrat and military veteran rose to the forefront with a series of plain-spoken television appearances in the days after President Joe Biden decided not to seek a second term. He has made his state a bastion of liberal policy and, this year, one of the few states to protect fans buying tickets online for Taylor Swift concerts and other live events.\n\nSome things to know about Walz:\n\nWalz comes from rural America\n\nIt would be hard to find a more vivid representative of the American heartland than Walz. Born in West Point, Nebraska, a community of about 3,500 people northwest of Omaha, Walz joined the Army National Guard and became a teacher in Nebraska.\n\nHe and his wife moved to Mankato in southern Minnesota in the 1990s. That\u2019s where he taught social studies and coached football at Mankato West High School, including for the 1999 team that won the first of the school\u2019s four state championships. He still points to his union membership there.\n\nWalz served 24 years in the Army National Guard, rising to command sergeant major, one of the highest enlisted ranks in the military, although he didn\u2019t complete all the training before he retired so his rank for benefits purposes was set at master sergeant.\n\nHe has a proven ability to connect with conservative voters\n\nIn his first race for Congress, Walz upset a Republican incumbent. That was in 2006, when he won in a largely rural, southern Minnesota congressional district against six-term Rep. Gil Gutknecht. Walz capitalized on voter anger with then-President George W. Bush and the Iraq war.\n\nDuring six terms in the U.S. House, Walz championed veterans\u2019 issues.\n\nHe\u2019s also shown a down-to-earth side, partly through social media video posts with his daughter, Hope. One last fall showed them trying a Minnesota State Fair ride, \u201cThe Slingshot,\u201d after they bantered about fair food and her being a vegetarian.\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz speaks during a news conference for the Biden-Harris campaign discussing the Project 2025 plan during the third day of the 2024 Republican National Convention near the Fiserv Forum, Wednesday, July 17, 2024, in Milwaukee.

(AP Photo/Joe Lamberti) Share Share Copy Link copied\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nX\n\nReddit\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nFlipboard\n\nPrint Read More\n\nHe could help the ticket in key Midwestern states\n\nWhile Walz isn\u2019t from one of the crucial \u201cblue wall\u201d states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, where both sides believe they need to win, he\u2019s right next door. He also could ensure that Minnesota stays in the hands of Democrats.\n\nThat\u2019s important because former President Donald Trump has portrayed Minnesota as being in play this year, even though the state hasn\u2019t elected a Republican to statewide office since 2006. A GOP presidential candidate hasn\u2019t carried the state since President Richard Nixon\u2019s landslide in 1972, but Trump has already campaigned there.\n\nWhen Democratic Gov. Mark Dayton decided not to seek a third term in 2018, Walz campaigned and won the office on a \u201cOne Minnesota\u201d theme.\n\nWalz also speaks comfortably about issues that matter to voters in the Rust Belt. He\u2019s been a champion of Democratic causes, including union organizing, workers\u2019 rights and a $15-an-hour minimum wage.\n\nHe has experience with divided government\n\nIn his first term as governor, Walz faced a Legislature split between a Democratic-led House and a Republican-controlled Senate that resisted his proposals to use higher taxes to boost money for schools, health care and roads. But he and lawmakers brokered compromises that made the state\u2019s divided government still seem productive.\n\nBipartisan cooperation became tougher during his second year as he used the governor\u2019s emergency power during the COVID-19 pandemic to shutter businesses and close schools. Republicans pushed back and forced out some agency heads. Republicans also remain critical of Walz over what they see as his slow response to sometimes violent unrest that followed the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020.\n\nThings got easier for Walz in his second term, after he defeated Republican Scott Jensen, a physician known nationally as a vaccine skeptic. Democrats gained control of both legislative chambers, clearing the way for a more liberal course in state government, aided by a huge budget surplus.\n\nWalz and lawmakers eliminated nearly all of the state abortion restrictions enacted in the past by Republicans, protected gender-affirming care for transgender youth and legalized the recreational use of marijuana.\n\nRejecting Republican pleas that the state budget surplus be used to cut taxes, Democrats funded free school meals for children, free tuition at public colleges for students in families earning under $80,000 a year, a paid family and medical leave program and health insurance coverage regardless of a person\u2019s immigration status.\n\nFILE - Minnesota Gov.

Walz later reiterated the characterization on CNN, citing Trump\u2019s repeated mentions of the fictional serial killer Hannibal Lecter from the film \u201cSilence of the Lambs\u201d in stump speeches.\n\nThe word quickly morphed into a theme for Harris and other Democrats and has a chance to be a watchword of the undoubtedly weird 2024 election.\n\n___\n\nHanna reported from Topeka, Kansas.",

        "text": "The Enduring Work of Protecting Voting Rights: 59 Years and Counting\nThe Justice Department once described the Voting Rights Act (VRA) as the most effective piece of civil rights legislation ever enacted. President Lyndon B. Johnson, when he signed the bill on Aug. 6, 1965, called it \u201cone of the most monumental laws in the entire history of American freedom.\u201d\n\nThe act has opened the door for more Americans to have voice in our democratic process. Sadly, though, opponents continue to undermine and obstruct access to the ballot. The Voting Rights Act is, as yet, a promise unfulfilled.\n\nJust last week, for example, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals contradicted its own precedent that has stood for 35 years when it overturned a lower court\u2019s ruling that a redistricting plan in Galveston County, Texas, violated Section 2 of the Act. The Court overruled its previous standard allowing politically cohesive Black and Latino voters to join together in claiming that an election system or districting plan denied them an equal opportunity to elect their candidates of choice.\n\nWhen signed into law, the VRA was the first legislation to forbid outright rules that denied voting rights on account of race or color. It also outlawed literacy tests, and it required jurisdictions to provide bilingual ballots if enough of their voters had limited English proficiency.\n\nImportantly, in Section 4(b), the act identified localities whose history of discrimination was egregious enough to warrant special oversight. Section 5 contained the consequential idea of preclearance: those identified localities would now have to submit potential voting rule changes for federal approval. They could no longer suppress votes at whim.\n\nFor almost half a century, this vital piece of legislation empowered the Justice Department to stop localities from obstructing voters of color from participating fully in the electoral process. Section 5 thwarted such barriers nearly 1,200 times.\n\nBut in 2013 the Supreme Court, in Shelby County v. Holder, found Section 4(b) of the VRA unconstitutional. Without it, Section 5\u2019s protective shield vanished. Shelby flung wide the floodgates to voter suppression, and opponents of representative democracy wasted no time in barreling through them.\n\nStates introduced restrictive voting measures the day of and in the days after Shelby, and they have continued to erode voting rights. Last year, the Brennan Center for Justice, a law and policy institute, declared that since 2013, nearly a hundred new laws have restricted voting rights, many in states previously identified by Section 4(b)\u2019s formula.\n\nAs a small sample, according to the Brennan Center, in 2021, at least 19 states passed 34 laws meant to abridge voting rights. In 2022, eight states passed 11 such laws and in 2023 at least 14 states passed 17.\n\nIn 2024, the barriers continue to mount.\n\nSome courts, seemingly unconstrained by either precedent or the language of the statute, have spurred on this destructive process with decisions that further curtail the protection of voting rights, fueling a surge of litigation assaults by state governments and others that even attack the constitutionality of Section 2, despite the Supreme Court decision upholding it in 2023.\n\nThese threats are grave, but the Justice Department\u2019s response is unstinting. As the actions below reveal, we vigorously confront voting discrimination.\n\nThe great heroes of the Civil Rights Movement, both leaders and foot soldiers, fought, bled and died to secure the precious right to vote. Now, in the courts, in the legislatures, and on the ground, we face deterioration of the voting rights that our forbearers sacrificed so much to win.\n\nWe call on you to become civil rights heroes. Report voting rights violations. Report threats against election workers. Speak out against efforts to restrict access to the polls.\n\nKnow that we will be there beside you. We will not shrink from the challenge. We will continue the struggle of those who came before us. We will honor their sacrifice. The stakes are too high; our freedom is too precious for anything less.",

        "text": "US presidential election: Kamala Harris on the sidelines of identity politics\nKamala Harris in Atlanta, Georiga, on July 30, 2024. JOHN BAZEMORE / AP\n\nFor the real launch of her campaign, on Tuesday, August 6, alongside her running mate for the first time, Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate in the American presidential election, chose the city of Philadelphia. As well as being in the crucial state of Pennsylvania, it is also the founding city of the American Republic, the glorious city where the Constitution was written in the summer of 1787.\n\nDemocrats like to refer to the text's preamble, as much for its opening words \"We the people of the United States\" as for what follows: \"In order to form a more perfect union.\" This expression is generally understood as aspiring to a form of social organization that the Founding Fathers, many of them slave owners, were unable to conceive: a multiracial democracy.\n\nBarack Obama came to Philadelphia to give his \"race speech\" on March 18, 2008. He had been forced to do so by the controversy created by the remarks of his pastor, Jeremiah Wright, violently condemning discrimination against Blacks. The candidate for the Democratic nomination in the November election distanced himself from this vision, while pleading, as he did throughout his presidency, for a \"more perfect union\" that would see the US assert its geopolitical advantage over the rest of the world by setting an example of the fulfillment of the American dream.\n\n'I am who I am'\n\nHarris, who supported Obama from the outset but reportedly hates being compared to him, has so far stuck to a different approach. As the first female district attorney of San Francisco; the first female attorney general of California, the country's most populous state; and the first female vice president of the US, the candidate seems in no hurry to play the identity card. When she talks about her ceiling-breaking career, as she did in her victory speech after the 2020 presidential election, it's often to quote the words of her mother, Indian-born oncology researcher Shyamala Gopan: \"You may be the first, but make sure you are not the last.\"\n\nWhen it comes to the race issue, she'd clearly rather avoid the subject. At 59, Harris isn't tormented by her identity. She defines herself as \"proudly American\" and leaves it to others to pigeonhole her if they care to. \"I am who I am,\" she told The Washington Post in 2015. \"I'm good with it.\" In 2020, on the Los Angeles Times podcast Asian Enough, she expressed her annoyance at having to explain things about herself that one wouldn't ask someone else to detail. \"I've never had an identity crisis,\" she said. \"The frustration I have is that people think I should have gone through such a crisis and need to explain it.\"\n\nYou have 67.75% of this article left to read.

Tim Walz as her running mate earlier this month.\n\nHere's the latest on who's the betting favorite to become the next President of the United States:\n\n*Disclaimer: Federal law prohibits political wagering in the United States, including the 2024 Presidential Election\n\n2024 Presidential election odds: Kamala Harris vs Donald Trump\n\nIn late July, former President Donald Trump was a massive -200 favorite (Bet $200 to win $100) on bet365 to be elected President of the United States for a second time while Harris sat at 2/1 (Bet $100 to win $200) in the betting market.\n\nThose numbers have now changed significantly.\n\nAs of Aug. 27, Harris (-120) now leads Trump (+100) to win the 2024 Presidential election, via bet365 on on Covers.com.\n\nThis boost for the current Vice President of the United States in not uncommon, as each side usually has the numbers go in their favor following a VP pick or when there's either the Democratic or Republican National Convention going on, with all four events in the rear view mirror and Election Day (Nov. 5) a little over two months away.\n\nEven though Harris is in the lead for now, don't be surprised if/when these odds to shift over the course of the next 10 weeks.\n\nAccuracy of Presidential elections odds in history\n\nAccording to the Conversation, the odds-on-favorite in the Presidential election has only lost twice since 1866.\n\nOne of those upsets was Trump himself, when he overcame 7/2 odds (22.22 implied win probability) to defeat Hilary Clinton, the Democratic nominee in the 2016 Presidential election.\n\nIf Harris and Walz can raise the numbers enough where they have the slight advantage coming out of Chicago, it could be their race to lose given the 158-year track record of the favorite becoming President.\n\nHowever, if Trump's still the odds-on-favorite come the end of the August, it will all but likely be his election to lose as he would become President of the United States for the second time in three terms.\n\nGannett may earn revenue from sports betting operators for audience referrals to betting services.

        "summary": " About 4.1 million Filipino Americans lived in the United States as of 2022, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau . About four-in-ten Filipino Americans live in California, with the highest concentrations in the Los Angeles and San Francisco metropolitan areas .",
        "text": "Filipino Americans: A Survey Data Snapshot\nFilipino Americans:\n\nA Survey Data Snapshot\n\nTagalog\n\nAbout 4.1 million Filipino Americans lived in the United States as of 2022, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau. Filipinos account for 17% of the nation\u2019s total Asian American population.\n\nUnlike most of the other major Asian origin groups, more Filipino Americans are U.S. born than immigrants (52% vs. 48%). Among Filipino immigrants, three-quarters (75%) are naturalized U.S. citizens \u2013 a higher share than among the other large Asian origin groups we studied, except Vietnamese Americans.\n\nRoughly four-in-ten Filipino Americans (1.6 million, or 38%) live in California, with the highest concentrations in the Los Angeles and San Francisco metropolitan areas. Other states with sizable numbers of Filipino Americans include Hawaii (270,000) and Texas (208,000).\n\nThe median income among Filipino American households was $100,600 in 2022, meaning that half of households headed by a Filipino American person earned more than that and half earned less. This is similar to the median household income among Asian Americans overall that year ($100,000).\n\nHere\u2019s a closer look at Filipino Americans\u2019 views on a range of topics, including how they describe their own identities and how they identify politically and religiously. These findings are based on a nationally representative Pew Research Center survey of 7,006 Asian adults in the U.S. \u2013 including 1,051 Filipino Americans \u2013 conducted in 2022 and 2023.\n\nIdentity\n\nFilipino Americans describe their identity in a variety of ways, as do Asian Americans overall. About six-in-ten (61%) say they most often describe themselves as \u201cFilipino\u201d or \u201cFilipino American.\u201d A fifth (20%) typically describe themselves as \u201cAsian American\u201d or \u201cAsian,\u201d while 13% most often call themselves \u201cAmerican.\u201d\n\nSome Filipino Americans say they have hidden a part of their heritage \u2013 such as cultural or religious practices \u2013 from people who are not Asian. In our survey, 16% say they have done this.\n\nViews of the U.S. and the Philippines\n\nFilipino Americans have broadly favorable views of the U.S. and the Philippines.\n\nAbout three-quarters of Filipino Americans (76%) have a very or somewhat favorable view of the U.S., and a similar share (72%) have a favorable opinion of the Philippines.\n\nAlthough a large majority of Filipino Americans have a favorable view of the Philippines, two-thirds say they wouldn\u2019t move there. Just 31% of Filipino adults in the U.S. say they\u2019d move to the Philippines, although that willingness varies significantly by where they were born. Filipino immigrants are about four times as likely as U.S.-born Filipino adults to say they would move to the Philippines (43% vs. 10%).\n\nAchieving the American dream\n\nMost Filipino Americans feel that they\u2019re either on their way to achieving the American dream or have already achieved it. About four-in-ten (41%) say they\u2019re on their way, while about three-in-ten (29%) say they\u2019ve already achieved it. However, 29% of Filipino Americans say the American dream is out of reach for them.\n\nPolitics\n\nMost Filipino American registered voters identify with or lean to the Democratic Party. About two-thirds of Filipino American voters (68%) are Democrats or lean Democratic, while 31% are Republicans or lean Republican. By comparison, among Asian American registered voters overall, 62% identify as or lean Democratic and 34% identify as or lean Republican.\n\nAs of 2022, two-thirds of all Filipino Americans \u2013 about 2.7 million people \u2013 were eligible to vote in the U.S., meaning they were at least 18 years old and citizens either through birth or naturalization, according to Census Bureau data.\n\nReligion\n\nFilipino Americans are more likely than the other large Asian American origin groups to say they are Christian. About three-quarters of Filipino Americans (74%) identify this way, including more than half (57%) who say they\u2019re Catholic. Smaller shares identify as evangelical Protestant (9%) and nonevangelical Protestant (7%). About a quarter of Filipino adults (23%) are not affiliated with any religion.\n\nPhoto by Paul Chinn/The San Francisco Chronicle via Getty Images\n\nHow we did this This analysis is one in a seven-part series that explores the identities, views, attitudes and experiences of Asian Americans, including the six largest Asian origin groups in the U.S. In these analyses, Asian Americans include those who identify as Asian, either alone or in combination with other races or Hispanic ethnicity. The six Asian origin groups highlighted in this series \u2013 Chinese, Filipino, Indian, Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese Americans \u2013 include those who identify with one Asian origin only, either alone or in combination with a non-Asian race or ethnicity. In this series, Chinese adults do not include those who self-identify as Taiwanese. Other Pew Research Center analyses exploring the attitudes and characteristics of Asian origin groups may use different definitions and therefore may not be directly comparable. This analysis is based on two data sources. The first is Pew Research Center\u2019s 2022-23 survey of Asian American adults, conducted from July 2022 to January 2023 in six languages among 7,006 respondents. The Center recruited a large sample to examine the diversity of the U.S. Asian population, with oversamples of the Chinese, Filipino, Indian, Korean and Vietnamese populations. These are the five largest origin groups among Asian Americans. The survey also includes a large enough sample of self-identified Japanese adults to make certain findings about them reportable. For more details, read the methodology. The second data source is the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s 2022 American Community Survey (ACS) provided through Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS) from the University of Minnesota. Pew Research Center is a subsidiary of The Pew Charitable Trusts, its primary funder. The Center\u2019s Asian American portfolio was funded by The Pew Charitable Trusts, with generous support from The Asian American Foundation; Chan Zuckerberg Initiative DAF, an advised fund of the Silicon Valley Community Foundation; the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation; the Henry Luce Foundation; the Doris Duke Foundation; The Wallace H. Coulter Foundation; The Dirk and Charlene Kabcenell Foundation; The Long Family Foundation; Lu-Hebert Fund; Gee Family Foundation; Joseph Cotchett; the Julian Abdey and Sabrina Moyle Charitable Fund; and Nanci Nishimura. We would also like to thank the Leaders Forum for its thoughtful leadership and valuable assistance in helping make this survey possible. The strategic communications campaign used to promote the research was made possible with generous support from the Doris Duke Foundation.\n\nFind out more:",

        "text": "Uncovering the complex history of campaign finance\nOn July 21, United States President Joe Biden announced he would be withdrawing from the 2024 presidential race, but not before endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris for the role. In the 24 hours that followed, Harris\u2019 campaign raised more than $81 million, which according to the campaign was the largest single-day total raised in U.S. history.\n\nWelcome to the unconventional and unpredictable world of campaign finance.\n\nIt\u2019s a world that Robin Kolodny, professor of political science at Temple University\u2019s College of Liberal Arts, knows well. Her new book, The Fundamentals of Campaign Finance in the U.S.: Why We Have the System We Have, offers a detailed look at the U.S. campaign finance system as it presently stands. The book is more than a historic retelling of campaign finance. Rather, it considers the campaign finance system in the context of the broader U.S. political and economic system while outlining the various factors that have led the system to become what it currently is.\n\n\u201cWithin the book, we\u2019re telling a continual story of campaign finance policy change and reactions to it. This book is not a call for reform, because both of us are pretty much resigned to the fact that we have some fundamental drivers in our political system who want us to continue with the policies we have in place,\u201d Kolodny said. \u201cThe cover of the book is a Jenga tower that\u2019s nearly falling over, and the point, of course, is that while we have a bare regulatory system now, what happens when one or two planks move? The whole thing could come tumbling down, and you might not have any regulation at all.\u201d\n\nRecently released by the University of Michigan Press, the new book was co-authored by Diana Dwyre, a professor of political science at California State University Chico. It is presently available for purchase on the University of Michigan Press\u2019 website as well as Amazon. However, through Amazon, it can also be downloaded instantly for free to a Kindle device, and the book is also available for free online via open access.\n\nWritten for people with little or no familiarity with federal campaign finance, Kolodny and Dwyre explain why we have a privately funded system, what candidates need to run campaigns and why donors choose to give their money to politics. Along the way, they explain how we now have so many different types of organizations raising and spending money, and how the changing judicial philosophy about what is important in elections led to the weakening of two landmark campaign finance laws.\n\n\u201cIt took candidates, parties, interest groups and the courts about 30 years to do serious damage to the spirit of the 1971 and 1974 FECA laws before legislators tried to remedy some of it through BCRA [Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act]. It took only 12 years, from BCRA\u2019s passage in 2002 to the McCutcheon decision in 2014, to essentially gut it,\u201d Kolodny and Dwyre write in chapter four.\n\nWithin the book, Kolodny also works to correct several misconceptions regarding campaign finance.\n\nFor instance, most folks often assume those with the most campaign spending or campaign donations have the most influence over political leaders. In actuality, different economic factors carry the most influence.\n\n\u201cTake the city of Philadelphia, for example,\u201d Kolodny said. \u201cIf the president of Comcast asks for a meeting with Mayor Cherelle Parker, the mayor is not going to take that meeting dependent on whether the Comcast has previously made campaign contributions. The mayor is going to take that meeting because Comcast is the largest private employer in Philadelphia. The structural power of businesses, especially in cities like Philadelphia, has way more outside influence than a person or entity who makes a campaign donation.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Kolodny cautioned that a particular individual\u2019s donation track record might not necessarily indicate where their political leanings lie.\n\n\u201cI always like to use the example of (Philadelphia Eagles owner) Jeffrey Lurie. If you looked at his campaign donations, you would assume that he is an enormous Democrat. Similarly, if you looked at the donations of (Houston Texans owner) Cal McNair, you would assume he is a huge Republican,\u201d Kolodny said. \u201cThe reality is that most of their donations are within a 150-mile radius of where their stadium resides, and they are just supporting the legislators that have jurisdiction of that 150-mile radius. Their donations are supporting the status quo, because they do not want things to change, because why would they? Change might not be good for business.\u201d\n\nOver the next several months and through the presidential election in early November, campaign finance is sure to be widely discussed in the news, which makes Kolodny\u2019s new book and its findings even more relevant.\n\nFor instance, since Harris was named the presumptive presidential candidate for the Democratic Party, former President Donald Trump has filed an FEC complaint alleging that if Harris receives the campaign funds that were previously made to Biden, it is a violation of federal law. Kolodny doesn\u2019t expect the complaint to go very far.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that Kamala\u2019s name was on the ticket from the very start. This was the Biden-Harris ticket,\u201d Kolodny said. \u201cPlus, these types of changes get approved all the time. Even if there were to be legs to this, it would not get sorted out until months after the election is already over.\u201d",

        "text": "24 things Donald Trump is promising to do\nThe latter is where we want to focus today: What Trump is saying he will do.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is known for his off-script moments. But his signature freewheeling banter also masks important consistency. He is, actually, predictable.\n\nFor more politics coverage and analysis, sign up for Here\u2019s the Deal, our weekly politics newsletter, here.\n\nThe Republican presidential nominee rarely commits to details or specifics. This is not unique to him as a politician, but Trump has a particularly pronounced form. His personal disregard for long policy briefs and policy intricacies is well known. Trump\u2019s primary approach as a politician is operating by instinct.\n\nThus, the question of what Trump himself proposes is a critical one.\n\nWe analyzed three rally speeches following President Joe Biden\u2019s withdrawal from the 2024 race. He made nearly the same promises at each one, each time a cap to his stump speech.\n\nBelow is a full list of what Trump promised, alongside some context. Of course, this is not a comprehensive list of every promise Trump has made, rather, a focused look at what he is promising right now on the campaign trail.\n\nA quick note: For some items, we have left the reader to interpret for themselves. Those are broad pledges that are straightforward, but not detailed such as, \u201cI will keep you out of wars,\u201d or, \u201cI will prevent World War III.\u201d\n\n1. On Day 1, \u201cwe will begin the largest deportation operation in American history.\u201d\n\nContext: Trump is pledging to deploy a \u201cmassive dragnet\u201d to arrest and deport millions of undocumented migrants. He has told crowds, and Time magazine in April, that he would use local law enforcement to do this as well as, potentially, the National Guard and active duty military. He has not offered more specifics about how any of those mechanisms would work. He has indicated in his speeches that he would first target \u201ccriminals,\u201d mentioning violent crimes like murder and rape.\n\nThis is not a new pledge. Trump promised mass deportations as part of his 2016 campaign.\n\n2. \u201cMy very first day back in the White House, I will terminate every single open border policy of the Biden-Harris administration, and we will seal the border.\u201d\n\nContext: Trump has promised to restore some of his hardline immigration policies that the Biden administration has reversed. He gave a run-down of this in Minnesota, saying, \u201cI will restore the travel ban, suspend refugee admissions, stop the resettlement, and keep the terrorists the hell out of our country.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s initial ban of people arriving from Muslim countries was ruled unconstitutional, but he revised it to focus on potential threats, though it still largely included Muslim countries.\n\nIn addition, Trump would bring back \u201cRemain in Mexico,\u201d which aimed to force asylum seekers to wait in Mexico before they could cross into the United States to claim asylum. That policy has faced legal, human rights and political pushback on both sides of the border.\n\nTrump has also indicated he may try to use Title 42 emergency powers for immigration purposes, especially in returning child migrants to families. And he has left open the idea of again separating migrant families, though a court has ruled that policy cannot restart during the next administration.\n\n3. \u201cWe will drill, baby, drill.\u201d\n\n4. \u201cWe will end inflation and make America affordable again.\u201d\n\nA pledge to end inflation ranks high on the 2024 Republican Party platform, though inflation has been down. And as for the promise to \u201cmake America affordable again\u201d? With Trump offering no specifics, that\u2019s up for interpretation.\n\n5. \u201cI will terminate the Green New Scam,\u201d and end the electric vehicle mandate.\n\nContext: As readers may know, the Green New Deal is a set of progressive-left climate and workplace ideas, most concretely written into legislative proposals by Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. The Green New Deal is not U.S. law, but Trump is using it in speeches to bash an unspecified range of ideas from the \u201cradical left.\u201d\n\nRegarding EVs, Biden put in place a new federal regulation in March that required automakers to increase fuel efficiency of their cars substantially over a number of years. That requirement would force many car companies to convert vehicles to electric or partially electric to meet the standard. Biden\u2019s policy has faced an avalanche of lawsuits already. Some believe it may be legally doomed, regardless of who becomes president, following a recent Supreme Court ruling.\n\n6. \u201cWe will pass massive tax cuts for workers\u201d that include no tax on tips.\n\nContext: This is a complicated area. Trump wants to extend the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act tax cuts that went in place during his administration, but they\u2019re set to expire in 2025. This would affect millions of Americans. Some 80 percent of households saw a tax cut in 2018 because of the TCJA, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. This would not be a new tax cut, but rather a proposal to stop taxes from going up.\n\nTrump does not mention this in his speeches, but Politico has reported that he has told business leaders he would like to lower corporate taxes, which will keep their 2017 tax cuts regardless. Those do not expire.\n\nAt the same time, CNBC has reported that Trump, in a meeting with House Republicans, raised the idea of replacing individual income taxes with an \u201call tariff policy.\u201d That idea has met with sharp pushback from some economists who say it is mathematically impossible and that tariffs generally have a regressive effect \u2014 they hurt working classes the most. (See below for more on tariffs.)\n\nHis tips idea is more straightforward. Trump wants to end taxation on income earned by tips. (This would require congressional action to move forward.) The Washington Post found that more than 6 million workers reported tips to the IRS in 2018. At the same time, this idea could cost some $150 to $250 billion in federal revenue over 10 years, per the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.\n\n7. \u201cI will revoke China\u2019s most favored nation status.\u201d\n\nContext: China was granted permanent and \u201cmost favored\u201d trade status in 2001 by Republican President George W. Bush, meaning the U.S. generally should offer China trade terms that are as good as any other trading partner with the U.S.\n\n8. \u201cI will pass the Trump Reciprocal Trade Act, that means that if China or any other country makes us pay a 100 or 200 percent tariff or tax, we will make them pay a reciprocal tariff or tax of 100 or 200 percent immediately, right back.\u201d\n\nContext: Trump explains this concept succinctly here. He would lean into any tariff war, retaliating \u201ceye-for-an-eye\u201d for a tariff imposed by other countries. Trump argues that this will protect American jobs, especially in manufacturing and other competitive industries. But others, including the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute, say it would end up being an economic mistake, raising prices for American consumers across the board and harming workers the most.\n\n9. Shortly after regaining the Oval Office, \u201cI will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled \u2026 quickly.\u201d\n\n10. \u201cI will prevent World War III.\u201d\n\n11. \u201cI will restore peace through strength.\u201d\n\nContext: World War III has been mentioned a ton in Trump speeches. In drawing a contrast between Biden and himself in their first presidential debate, Trump warned viewers that the president would draw the country further into global conflict. Now facing off against Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump has continued to invoke the specter of a third World War.\n\nHere\u2019s how he put it in his speech in Charlotte, North Carolina: \u201cI will prevent World War III. We\u2019re heading to World War III, we\u2019re heading right into the teeth of it \u2026 I will restore peace through strength.\u201d\n\n12. \u201cIn my next term, we will build a great Iron Dome missile defense shield over our country, a dome the likes of which no one has ever seen before, and it will be entirely made in the USA.\u201d\n\nNote: In Minnesota, Trump said \u201cit will be entirely made in Minnesota \u2026 Minnesota has got a big piece of it.\n\nContext: Trump is referencing Israel\u2019s project Iron Dome, a series of missile defense capabilities that aim to destroy short-range weapons launched against the country. It is not clear what threats Trump aims the dome to address, with some experts pointing out that the contiguous U.S. is surrounded by allied countries and oceans. Intelligence officials said China was responsible for a spy balloon that sailed over the country in 2023 before it was shot down by current military capabilities.\n\nMinnesota is the nation\u2019s leading producer of iron ore.\n\n13. \u201cI will not cut one penny from Social Security or Medicare, and I will not raise the retirement age.\u201d\n\nContext: Social Security\u2019s trust funds will be depleted by 2035, according to this year\u2019s trustees report. At that point, without any action by lawmakers in Washington, payments to seniors will be cut by 27 percent. Medicare\u2019s hospital trust fund would go broke in 2036 under the current policy.\n\nThere are a few ways to provide solvency, but increasingly all involve some pain \u2014 increasing retirement age, cutting benefits or increasing what some or all Americans must contribute.\n\nTrump\u2019s promise misses the important context that without any action, there will be cuts to these benefits.\n\n14. \u201cI am going to keep you out of wars.\u201d\n\n15. \u201cWe have people at the top [of the military] that are woke, and they\u2019re all gone. We are going to get rid of them so fast.\u201d\n\nContext: Trump said this in St. Cloud, Minnesota, only. Trump asserted that most military generals are not \u201cwoke,\u201d but that some are. Trump is pledging to get rid of those who are \u201cwoke.\u201d\n\n16. \u201cWe are going to rebuild our cities into beacons of hope, safety and beauty better than they\u2019ve ever been before.\u201d\n\nContext: Trump says he would work with Democratic mayors and governors to achieve this, but has not provided details.\n\nTrump regularly raises concerns about crime in America, especially in cities. Politifact checked these statements and found Trump\u2019s words about rising crime rates to be \u201cmostly false,\u201d because violent crime rates have fallen for most of the country. Property crime has risen, including car thefts.\n\nIn addition, the conservative American Enterprise Institute has written about data showing that urban Americans are slightly more likely to say they\u2019re \u201cpretty happy\u201d with their lives than rural Americans.\n\n17. \u201cWe will take over the horribly run capital of our nation \u2026 and clean it up, renovate it, rebuild it.\u201d\n\nContext: Trump\u2019s vision for the nation\u2019s capital is to require traditional and neoclassical architecture, based on Renaissance ideas of Greco-Roman aesthetics. As he was exiting his presidency in late 2020, he issued an executive order declaring that the federal government has \u201clargely stopped building beautiful buildings\u201d and that in D.C., \u201cclassical architecture shall be the preferred and default architecture for Federal public buildings.\u201d\n\nIn these rally speeches, Trump has also said of D.C. that \u201cwe are going to take over the management, the leadership of it.\u201d Residents of the nation\u2019s capital do not have a vote in Congress, but for 50 years Congress has allowed them \u201chome rule,\u201d so that their city council can generally oversee how the city operates. Congress and the White House retain a kind of veto power. Trump allies and pushing to end D.C. home rule. This may be what he is implying here.\n\n18. I will sign an executive order that cuts federal funding \u201cfor any school pushing critical race theory, transgender insanity and other inappropriate racial, sexual or political content onto the shoulders of our children.\u201d\n\nContext: There is a lot to unpack here. But Trump has largely not defined precisely which policies he would attempt to penalize. At the same time, there is a legal battle over interpretations of Biden administration rules that declare Title IX protections based on sex include safeguards for LGBTQ+ youth. Trump\u2019s policies would need to follow federal court guidance, once established.\n\n19. I will defund any school that has a vaccine or mask mandate.\n\nContext: See this helpful segment from White House correspondent Laura Barr\u00f3n-L\u00f3pez. In short, medical experts say the implications of eliminating vaccine mandates would be enormous for schools and for public health.\n\n20. \u201cI will keep men out of women\u2019s sports.\u201d\n\nContext: Trump is proposing a ban on transgender women from participating in women\u2019s sports. When he speaks about this, he largely refers to youth sports. See above, regarding trans youth.\n\n21. \u201cI will fully uphold our Second Amendment.\u201d\n\nContext: Trump has indicated that he would oppose most, if not all, new restrictions on gun usage and ownership.\n\n22. \u201cWe will protect innocent life.\u201d\n\nContext: On abortion, Trump supports the current status quo, that is to say that states have the right to restrict or nearly ban abortion as they choose. This stance on abortion has put him at odds with some of his base voters who would like a national ban. But Trump has indicated he would not support that.\n\nA side note: Trump does not usually use the word \u201cabortion\u201d in his speeches. Instead he nods to the issue, as well as others, by using this broad phrasing.\n\n23. \u201cWe will restore, very quickly, free speech.\u201d\n\nContext: This short phrase leads to an extensive plan for \u201cfree speech\u201d reform that Trump announced in 2022. He would use presidential power to limit what rules federal agencies, universities and tech companies could employ to address speech, including controversial ideas.\n\nTrump, alongside other right-wing figures and his supporters, have made continuous claims that a combination of news media, social media platforms and a \u201cdeep state\u201d arm of the government have sought to suppress their speech.\n\nTrump has been a major purveyor of \u201cthe Big Lie\u201d \u2014 that the 2020 election was \u201cstolen\u201d and he was the real winner. Biden won the election. Despite Trump\u2019s insistence that he was the actual victor, courts on the state and federal level confirmed the outcome of the election in Biden\u2019s favor. In fact, Biden broke the record for the most total votes cast for a U.S. presidential candidate, a record previously set by Barack Obama in 2008.\n\n24. \u201cI will secure our elections.\u201d\n\nContext: This promise echoes the official Republican party platform of securing elections by calling for same-day voting, paper ballots, proof of citizenship and voter identification. At the same time, Republican leaders have urged voters to use all available options for casting their ballots, like absentee or mail-in voting. Trump has falsely claimed that voting by mail or using drop boxes is less secure and, thus, more open to mass voter fraud. (It\u2019s not.)\n\nTrump, since losing the 2020 election to Biden, has repeatedly cast doubt on the outcome and integrity of the last presidential contest. Trump delivered combative remarks and baseless claims of voter fraud to supporters, including moments before the Jan. 6 insurrection.\n\nPart of his reelection message to his base has been to \u201cguard the vote.\u201d This has raised alarm bells over safeguarding democracy and elections and escalated concerns about voter intimidation and election workers during November\u2019s election.",

According to the latest NPR/PBS News/Marist poll , the presumptive Democrat candidate has built a 51%-48% lead over the former president. It is 4 points better than what was found in the poll held immediately after US President Joe Biden stepped aside and endorsed the vice president two weeks ago.NPR has reported that Kamala Harris got this increased support because Black voters, white women with college degrees and women who identify as political independents have supported her. The Democrat contender has received 20 to 30 points more than the time when she first entered the race. She has improved her lead in the suburbs and with white voters overall.Kamala Harris is in a better condition also because there is no anti-incumbency factor against her and she is not being held responsible for economic woes, unlike Biden. Donald Trump is doing better on the issue of economy as but only by 3 points over Harris (51%-48%), compared to 9 points over the incumbent president (54%-45%) in June. Similarly, the Republican candidate is doing better on the issue of handling immigration by 6 points (52%-46%). However, on the issue of abortion, the vice president has an advantage of 15%.The NPR/PBS News/Marist poll was held from Thursday to Sunday before Harris picked Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate. The surveyors interviewed 1,613 adults via cellphone, landline and online research panels in English and Spanish.The CBS/YouGov poll showed Kamala Harris up by the barest of margins, but doing dramatically better than Joe Biden had been before he decided to step aside and endorse the vice president.According to the recently held NPR/PBS News/Marist poll , 56% of the US citizens think Kamala Harris, not Donald Trump (41%), would better handle the abortion issue.According to an NPR/PBS News/Marist poll, Donald Trump is doing better on the issue of economy as but only by 3 points over Harris (51%-48%), compared to 9 points over the incumbent president (54%-45%) in June.",

BU Experts Talk about Why\u2014and the Way Forward\n\nPhoto by Douglas Rissing/iStock Politics Is Our Democracy at Risk? Americans think so. Faculty experts say electoral reforms, compromise, and a bit of moral outrage might be in order.\n\nWith the 2024 presidential election booming, one phrase stands out as a harbinger of uncertain times: democracy at risk. It\u2019s been covered in news, invoked by liberal and conservative pundits and presidential candidates, and fretted over in private.\n\nSurveys show Americans are concerned about the state of democracy. In March 2024, the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service announced its latest bipartisan Battleground Civility Poll: 81 percent of respondents said they believe democracy in America is being threatened. Three months before, an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll found 62 percent of adults believe democracy in the US \u201ccould be at risk,\u201d depending on which presidential candidate wins this fall. \u201cThe poll asked about the importance of the coming presidential election for 12 issues and found that the percentage who said the outcome will be very or extremely important to the future of democracy in the U.S. (67%) ranked behind only the economy (75%),\u201d the AP said in December 2023.\n\nIn general, those who see our form of government in decline point to issues like immigration, voter suppression, compromised election integrity, entrenched bipartisanship, rising authoritarian sentiment, and fears about media manipulation.\n\nBruce Schulman, William E. Huntington Professor of History at the College of Arts & Sciences, puts our present-day grasp of democracy in a historical context. \u201cThe [founding fathers] thought of themselves as having created a democratic system, but we have to understand that even our most fundamental ideas of what a democracy entails have changed over time,\u201d he says, noting that two centuries ago, only one-tenth of the population\u2014all white, male landowners\u2014was able to vote.\n\nSince then, our collective notion of the boundaries of democracy have expanded and contracted in different contexts. During and after both World Wars, Schulman says, American citizens saw an increase in \u201ccensorship, crackdown on dissent, extraordinary powers taken by the government, and the rise of vigilantism\u2014such as attacks on immigrants or persecution of alleged communists.\n\n\u201cDemocratic systems rest on a set of laws and practices\u2014but also on a set of norms and cultural assumptions\u2014that are vulnerable to attack,\u201d which can often manifest \u201cas a hostility to the values of openness, tolerance, inclusion, diversity, and respect for opposing viewpoints.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, he says, as we move toward a historic rematch between two controversial presidential candidates, we\u2019re also moving into uncharted waters.\n\n\u201cIn our current cycle, every Republican politician is asked if they will accept the results of the election,\u201d Schulman says, \u201cand the fact that this is a question is just plain weird.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn our current cycle, every Republican politician is asked if they will accept the results of the election, and the fact that this is a question is just plain weird.\u201d Bruce Schulman, William E. Huntington Professor of History at the College of Arts & Sciences\n\nHow did we get here? Who is responsible for eroding the public\u2019s trust, and how can we get it back? Bostonia spoke with BU faculty members about some of the issues that may be putting our system of government at risk.\n\nDeepfakes and Denialism\n\nIn a recent analysis in the Washington Post, three political scientists wrote about their research on the impact of fake news: \u201cThe prospect of sharing false information\u2014spread by individuals and foreign governments\u2014threatens the quality of democracy in America. False and noisy information makes voters more likely to reelect poorly performing governments and lowers public confidence in democracy.\u201d\n\nJoan Donovan, a College of Communication assistant professor, studies misinformation and disinformation in a media environment\u2014the internet and social media\u2014where \u201calternative facts\u201d and outright falsehoods have reached crisis levels. She believes that citizens have \u201ca human right to the truth.\u201d\n\nTraditional media has its safeguards in the form of fact-checking and gatekeeping, but internet platforms and social media demolish all barriers, Donovan says. Without a stringent regard for factual information, the new media landscape has become rife with conspiracy theories, deepfakes, science denialism, and propaganda, often masquerading as genuine information. A TikTok video circulated in January, for example, featured audio that was AI-generated to sound like President Joe Biden calling for F-15 fighter jets to be sent to the Texas-Mexico border. The audio was deemed a deepfake by the Poynter Institute for Media Studies and other experts.\n\nJoan Donovan, College of Communication assistant professor of journalism and emerging media studies\n\n\u201cAnything that is novel and outrageous is going to circulate further and faster across social media than anything that is fact-based,\u201d Donovan says, \u201cand we don\u2019t have companies at the helm of the information ecosystem that are willing to address these issues head-on.\u201d\n\nSearch engine algorithms share the blame, she adds. Algorithms like Google\u2019s prioritize information that\u2019s \u201cfresh and relevant\u201d or trending over information that\u2019s been factually verified. And often, this trending information has an agenda attached to it.\n\n\u201cNot a lot of people are going to wake up every day and remind the internet that the Holocaust happened, but there are a large number of people that are willing to wake up every day and deny the Holocaust,\u201d Donovan says. \u201cIf you search for \u2018Did the Holocaust happen?\u2019 it shouldn\u2019t be the case that there are two or three new results every other day.\u201d\n\nThe people who generate disinformation \u201chave an outsize influence on our culture, on our society, on our politics,\u201d she says. \u201cIf they were to call for an insurrection or some kind of coup, they may be able to organize a large enough militia to do so. I know that sounds crazy to think about, but it\u2019s one of the consequences of having technology organized in this way\u2014the people with the largest network are going to exercise more power, potentially more power than politicians.\u201d\n\nIf challenges to factual information are a threat to democracy, as some say, aren\u2019t challenges to free speech, even conspiratorial speech, of equal concern? Perhaps, but Donovan is adamant that regulating the internet is not the same thing as curtailing free speech.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have more or less free speech because the internet exists\u2014you have the capacity to broadcast it, which is different,\u201d she says. \u201cBut the free speech question becomes the major argumentative point that prevents any policy from coming forward.\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t have more or less free speech because the internet exists\u2014you have the capacity to broadcast it, which is different.\n\nWhat might that policy look like? Donovan calls for an effort to keep a record of all posts made by elected officials\u2014a project she is engaged in at BU\u2014which would hold them to account if they were to promulgate antidemocratic ideas. In terms of broader ideological reforms, she\u2019d like to see the internet function more like a public utility, such as a library, and less like a corporate platform.\n\n\u201cWe need to have processes of peer review in order to see more stability in what gets returned when you search for something,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s been capture of communication, and downstream of that is a society that\u2019s much more vulnerable to authoritarianism.\u201d\n\nPolitical Violence\n\nWhen Steve Rosenzweig watched the news on January 6, 2021, he was shocked. But he also knew that years of extremist rhetoric on social media was bound to boil over into violent action.\n\n\u201cIn hindsight, the writing was on the wall,\u201d says Rosenzweig, a College of Arts & Sciences assistant professor of political science. \u201cI actually wrote an opinion piece in the Boston Globe a couple of months before that, warning that\u2026violence was on the table.\u201d\n\nThe Globe piece was eerily prescient: \u201cBarring an indisputable landslide on election night, Trump appears likely to contest the results. He will claim rampant voter fraud. He will demand that the courts and the Justice Department intercede on his behalf. And he will wink and nod at the armed extremists currently occupying the fringe of his base.\u201d\n\nSteve Rosenzweig, College of Arts & Sciences assistant professor of political science\n\nMany will remember that day as an unprecedented show of political violence by a group propelled by the belief\u2014without evidence\u2014that the 2020 presidential election results were illegitimate. Rosenzweig, a scholar of political violence in East African countries, is acutely aware that the US has a history of using brute force to achieve political ends.\n\nThe American violence of the 19th and 20th centuries was explicitly racially motivated. Rosenzweig cites the 1965 march on Selma, Ala., where Martin Luther King, Jr. (GRS\u201955, Hon.\u201959) and supporters of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 were met with violent opposition, as a prime example.\n\n\u201cThe amount of time in which we have a fully democratic system for all people in the US has only really been since the Voting Rights Act at the earliest,\u201d Rosenzweig says. \u201cWe sometimes forget that the periods in which we\u2019ve had full multiracial democracy and relatively low levels of political violence are almost an anomaly.\u201d\n\nThere are plenty of examples of reversing democratic erosion or backsliding, Rosenzweig says: \u201cIn Senegal, there have been presidents who have tried to extend their time in office and were forced to backtrack, and you saw peaceful transitions as a result.\n\n\u201cBut violence, once it\u2019s out of the box, is a little more difficult to put back in.\u201d\n\nThe key to keeping a society free of political violence, he says: \u201cEvery political system has those who might utilize violence in pursuit of their goals. What determines whether violence becomes common or not is the extent to which mainstream politicians endorse it.\u201d\n\nVoter Suppression\n\nIn the last few decades, many states have mounted barriers to the ballot box\u2014imposing strict voter ID laws, decreased voting times, and restricted registration. Such measures have deleterious outcomes, with \u201cracial minorities, poor people, and young and old voters\u201d as the primary targets, according to the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law.\n\nChristine Slaughter, a College of Arts & Sciences assistant professor of political science, researches the voter landscape, probing the psychological reasons certain demographic groups, like Black individuals, do and do not turn out to vote and which candidates they choose.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a prominent theory of Black political behavior\u2026that demonstrates that Black people believe what happens to the group will have something to do with what happens in their lives,\u201d she says. \u201cNot too many other racial groups have that sense of solidarity that shapes their politics, and looking across the political landscape, we can see that linked fate is a unique attribute for Black voters.\u201d\n\nChristine Slaughter, College of Arts & Sciences assistant professor of political science\n\nSlaughter\u2019s research finds that Black voters, and Black women in particular, are impelled by a sense of political optimism that sees them well-represented at the ballot box. This optimism was manifested in a decisive turnout during the 2020 presidential election, and some political scientists credit that turnout to Biden\u2019s victory. It was also a year marked by significant attempts to compromise voting integrity, which could likely reemerge in November 2024, Slaughter says.\n\n\u201cIn many states, African American voters experience disenfranchisement and vote dilution, which weakens their ability to make an electoral impact,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd the Democrats have not done much to stand against fraud allegations [made by Republicans], or move quickly to pass a new Voting Rights Act prior to this election, or ensure equal representation.\u201d\n\nIn many states, African American voters experience disenfranchisement and vote dilution, which weakens their ability to make an electoral impact.\n\nReforms to address voter suppression (which frequently targets Black individuals and other voters of color) are steps in the right direction, Slaughter says. \u201cBut despite their effectiveness, not all states adopt these reforms,\u201d leaving voters especially vulnerable in states with restrictive voting laws.\n\nShe also notes that while electoral reforms to improve voter access and convenience\u2014like online and same-day registration and the elimination of barriers like required photo identification\u2014can be effective in certain areas, \u201cno one reform has a uniform effect across states.\u201d Politics, she adds, always factor into how, where, and when people vote.\n\n\u201cTherefore, several approaches exist to improving voter confidence, and each has some benefits but also some drawbacks,\u201d she says. \u201cUnfortunately, it takes elected officials coming across the aisle in order to implement them [effectively], and in such a polarizing time, that is unlikely to happen.\u201d\n\nExtreme Populism\n\nVivien Schmidt, Jean Monnet Professor of European Integration and a professor emerita of international relations and political science at the Frederick S. Pardee School of Global Studies, is a scholar of European populism, an ideology she says is characterized by its \u201cus versus them\u201d message, its charismatic messenger, and its ability to create messages that resonate with citizens\u2019 economic, social, and political discontent.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s anti-elite, antiestablishment, and it tends to be angry,\u201d she says. \u201cThe discourse can be seen as anti-liberal democracy, because it\u2019s against any kind of intermediary institutions.\u201d\n\nPopulism is also often spoken of in the same breath as nationalism, particularly when examining extreme conservative movements, she says. \u201cOn the right, national sovereignty has become a major issue, because it\u2019s about identity\u2014it\u2019s about an ideal of identity from the past,\u201d she says. \u201cIn the US in particular, it links to white supremacy.\u201d\n\nFar-right populist messaging in Europe and in the US tend to mirror each other, but Schmidt warns of some key differences in scope. For one thing, the European Union continues to act as a checks-and-balances system that prevents antidemocratic movements from taking over the continent.\n\nSo, why is right-wing populism so threatening, and why is it happening now?\n\n\u201cIn the US, extreme right populism moves toward authoritarianism,\u201d Schmidt explains. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing more policymakers and ordinary voters saying they want a strong leader.\u201d\n\nIn the US, extreme right populism moves toward authoritarianism. Vivien Schmidt, Jean Monnet Professor of European Integration and professor emerita of international relations and political science at the Frederick S. Pardee School of Global Studies\n\nThe movement incubated in the financial crisis of the 2000s and the collapse of American manufacturing, where average Americans went from \u201cgood manufacturing jobs to not-good service jobs to the platform economy,\u201d she says. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t people be angry, and why wouldn\u2019t they worry about being left behind? They look at the politicians to say, \u2018You haven\u2019t solved my problem.\u2019\u201d\n\nSchmidt says that regrettably, only in a liberal democracy can citizens campaign for, and ultimately achieve, an autocratic state: \u201cWinston Churchill said that democracy is the worst form of government except for all the other ones. There\u2019s nothing inherent in democracy to save it from the authoritarian drift. In order to make it work, you need consensus, you need compromise, and you need people to talk to one another.\u201d\n\nCitizen Mobilization\n\nIt may seem paradoxical, but according to Schulman, now is not the time to double down on the old ways.\n\n\u201cThe idea that a constitution would survive for 200 years would never have occurred to the framers,\u201d he says. Democracy must be allowed to evolve. In the beginning of the 20th century, for instance, major progressive reforms, like women\u2019s voting rights, were passed through on-the-ground campaigning, which led to constitutional amendments, he says.\n\n\u201cIn the last 60 years, the Constitution has not been amended in any substantial way,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople have to agree to say, \u2018Hey, this isn\u2019t working,\u2019 in order to fix things.\u201d\n\nRobert L. Tsai, School of Law professor of law and Harry Elwood Warren Memorial Scholar\n\nRobert L. Tsai, a School of Law professor of law, Harry Elwood Warren Memorial Scholar, and an expert in constitutional policy, says it\u2019s the power of moral outrage that gets representatives to start listening, changes laws, creates amendments, and determines the success or failure of an initiative.\n\n\u201cYou need outrage, particularly in our modern age, when so many things make us feel fairly indifferent to the suffering of others,\u201d he says. \u201cI have faith that if you\u2019re willing to embrace a certain amount of messiness, people will eventually come together.\u201d\n\nBut Tsai believes that citizen campaigns should not necessarily be focused on getting amendments passed or achieving favorable Supreme Court rulings. Instead, that energy should be trained on local and state courts.\n\n\u201cI can cite you any number of laws that the Supreme Court basically killed in the cradle decades ago, where lawyers got totally repudiated,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd those cases get cited now as terrible law. On the other hand, if you look at the states that passed the Equal Rights Amendment [in the 1970s], it was done through citizen mobilization.\u201d\n\nThis is not mere theory, Tsai notes. The ideals that are the bedrock of our democracy have come to fruition as the result of citizen efforts in the smaller courts. \u201cMost of us who are living in America believe in democracy\u2014one person, one vote. But most people don\u2019t realize that that principle is not actually written anywhere in the Constitution,\u201d he says. \u201cThe only reason the Supreme Court ever even uttered those words is because of the mobilization that went on for generations at the local level, to make state elections more democratic, and more open.\u201d",

        "text": "Latter-day Saints, Democrats and Republicans, join forces to support Harris \u2022 Idaho Capital Sun\nA group of Kamala Harris supporters convened in a virtual call Tuesday evening. It was an eclectic mix with attorneys, lawmakers, podcasters, singers and a mayor. There were, certainly, Democrats on the speaker lists, but also Republicans who have decided to step away from their party\u2019s ticket this year.\n\nWhat connected all of them? Their Latter-day Saint faith.\n\nMembers of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints may be a substantial force in presidential outcomes in deeply red Utah and battleground Arizona, according to speakers, including Mayor of Mesa, Arizona, John Giles, who is Republican, but is a vocal Harris supporter; former Democratic U.S. representative from Utah Ben McAdams; and Salt Lake City Democratic legislators Sen. Luz Escamilla and Rep. Brian King, the latter also being the Democratic gubernatorial nominee in Utah.\n\nData shows that Latter-day Saints are poised to support Harris \u201cmore than any other presidential Democratic ticket in 60 years,\u201d said Jacob Rugh, an associate professor in the Department of Sociology at church-run Brigham Young University, during the call. He cited his research and past races that have moved the needle left in Utah and Maricopa County in Arizona.\n\n\u201cMy geospatial analysis shows that areas heavy with LDS chapels in the east valley were most likely to flip blue (in 2020),\u201d Rugh said on Tuesday. Nationwide, in 2020, 1 in 3 Latter-day Saint voters picked the Biden-Harris ticket, and the majority of the faith\u2019s millennial and Gen Z voters chose the Democratic ticket, according to Rugh.\n\nLDS membership in the West\n\nThe 2020 Biden-Harris ticket performance in Utah \u201cwas the best of any Democratic ticket since 1964. Salt Lake County flipped blue in 2016 and, in 2020, voters did what others said was impossible by flipping four precincts blue in Provo,\u201d Rugh said. He predicts they \u201cwill flip even more in 2024.\u201d\n\nThere are 2.1 million members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Utah, according to data from the church. It\u2019s the most prominent faith in Utah, which has historically voted red. There are also more than 442,800 members in Arizona and more than 476,000 members in Idaho.\n\nAbout 1,400 people tuned into Tuesday\u2019s call, a first from a group called Latter-day Saints for Harris-Walz, which on its social media boasted of as many as 2,600 registrants. The event came the same day Harris announced she had picked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate.\n\nThe remarks from presenters, mostly from Utah and Arizona, were preceded by a prayer. Speakers also cited scripture as they spoke about the character of the Republican presidential nominee, former President Donald Trump, and to explain why, in their view, the most Latter-day Saint-aligned candidate is Harris.\n\nMostly, it was a discussion on how to organize to elect Harris. After all, Rob Taber, an organizer, said Latter-day Saints \u201cfrom missions and ministering, (are) pretty good at reaching out to people and building bridges.\u201d\n\nHowever, Taber also advised those on the call not to use ward or stake membership lists when reaching out to people because that violates the church\u2019s neutrality policy.\n\n\u201cBut you can share on social media how you\u2019re feeling. This actually does make a big difference,\u201d Taber said.\n\nLDS Church encourages members to \u2018examine the character\u2019 of candidates\n\nAsk Mesa Mayor John Giles why he decided to support a Democratic candidate and he may cite the arguments he made in an op-ed he wrote in Arizona Central criticizing Trump\u2019s refusal to accept the outcome of the 2020 election and his disinvestment in cities like Mesa, and where he called on other Arizona Republicans to choose \u201ccountry over party this election.\u201d\n\nBut, he may also mention an admonition he heard at a Latter-day Saint church meeting that encouraged members to be good citizens, to participate in elections and to \u201cexamine the character of the candidates.\u201d\n\n\u201cMan, I sincerely hope that we get that admonition this election season, because I think that would help our brothers and sisters to look with fresh eyes at this election,\u201d Giles said on Tuesday.\n\nGiles also cited the church\u2019s stance on defending the U.S. Constitution and how different that perspective is from Trump\u2019s view, he said.\n\nTrump is \u201cmore than willing to compromise the rule of law and the United States Constitution to further his own gains,\u201d Giles said. \u201cI think that we have a particular mission as Latter-day Saints to step up and point those things out to our friends inside the church and outside as well.\u201d\n\nSome of the attendees, such as McAdams, said they vote Democrat \u201cnot in spite of our religion, but because of our religion,\u201d arguing that \u201cnegativity, divisiveness, rage, political violence, discrimination and racism are not of God.\u201d\n\nUtah Senate Minority Leader Luz Escamilla said that, as she was preparing to teach Sunday School, it was clear to her that Trump may not be aligned with Latter-day Saint doctrine. She quoted Elder Dallin H. Oaks, first counselor in the church\u2019s First Presidency.\n\n\u201cHe said \u2018knowing that we are all children of God, give us a divine vision of the worth of all others and the will and ability to rise above prejudice and racism.\u2019 The current candidate for the Republican Party is literally working tirelessly to create prejudice and racism against Americans,\u201d Escamilla said. \u201cAnd that alone is a reason why all members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints should be supporting Vice President Harris for President of the United States in the 2024 election cycle.\u201d\n\nUtah gubernatorial candidate Rep. Brian King also praised Harris\u2019 running mate, arguing that Walz fits into the model he likes to see in the country\u2019s candidates and elected officials.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the kind of candidate that leaders of our faith have called for us to support, a person of integrity, compassion, with a commitment to service,\u201d King said. \u201cI\u2019m so glad that Vice President Harris has revealed her own personality so clearly in her choice of running mate.\u201d\n\nUtah News Dispatch, like the Idaho Capital Sun, is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

        "text": "Poll suggests Republicans who believe Trump won in 2020 expect significant chaos in November\nMedia Inquiries Name Hannah Robbins Email hlrobbins@jhu.edu Cell phone 667-232-9047\n\nRepublicans who believe Donald Trump won the 2020 election are anticipating a much more chaotic election cycle this year than other GOP, Democratic, and independent voters, according to new polling data from the SNF Agora Institute at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nLilliana Mason Associate professor of political science \"Expecting chaos can fuel more chaos. If we're not diligent, that chaos can unravel the foundational threads of our democracy.\"\n\nAmong Republican respondents who believe President Joe Biden did not lawfully win the 2020 election, about 31% think that either \"a lot\" or \"a great deal\" of political violence will occur after the 2024 election\u2014compared to 24% of Democratic voters, 21% of independents and just 12% of GOP voters who acknowledge Biden's victory four years ago, the poll found.\n\nIn addition, 65% of Republicans known popularly as \"election deniers\" also believe that the United States is \"very likely\" or \"somewhat likely\" to lapse into a civil war\u2014higher than the 40% of other Republicans, 43% of Democrats, and 46% of independents who expressed similar sentiments.\n\nThe poll questioned 2,000 Americans eligible to vote and was conducted July 26-30 by Lilliana Mason and Scott Warren from SNF Agora Institute and YouGov, a polling and data company based in the United Kingdom. The poll is the first of four that will take place during this election season and was commissioned as part of an effort to better understand the U.S. electorate and the growing divide between Republicans who do not accept the 2020 election results and those who do.\n\n\"Fortunately, most Americans don't think the same way as the 2020 election deniers. But that doesn't mean we're in the clear. Expecting chaos can fuel more chaos,\" said Mason, a political science professor who studies political violence and polarization and who is co-lead on the project with Warren. \"If we're not diligent, that chaos can unravel the foundational threads of our democracy.\"\n\nResearchers worked with YouGov to poll a demographically and politically representative sample of the U.S. electorate. Respondents were asked about their party affiliations, the 2020 election results, where they get their information from, and what they think about people from other parties.\n\nMost respondents\u2014nearly 70%\u2014think it's important to accept election results even if their candidate loses.\n\n\"For a free and fair democratic election to work, people need to believe in the electoral system and accept the outcome,\" said Warren, an SNF Agora fellow. \"Our elected leaders should heed the fact that the vast majority of Americans believe that our elections work, and that losing candidates should concede. Rather than sowing doubts, leaders need to talk about how these democratic institutions work and build trust with the electorate.\"\n\nOf note, 85% of respondents are still concerned about misinformation in the election.\n\nRepublicans who believe Trump won in 2020 are more concerned about misinformation than any other group surveyed and believe \"liberal media\" are responsible. These respondents also stated they are most likely to turn to \"their favorite television news anchor,\" \"friends and family,\" and \"chief election officers\" for information about the outcomes of elections in their states.\n\nDemocrats blamed misinformation nearly equally between \"Republican politicians\" and \"conservative media\" and reported relying on chief election officers for election results sooner than GOP respondents.\n\n\"We know that what leadership does matters. Leaders in politics and media have a real influence on their supporters,\" Mason said. \"If they continue to push a dangerous and chaotic vision of what the election might look like, they could end up creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. If they prefer to have a nonviolent election, there are some simple and easy things they can do.\"\n\nMason said that leadership can refrain from inflammatory rhetoric, clearly state that violence from supporters is unacceptable, and disavow violence when it occurs.\n\nResearchers will survey the same pool of respondents again in September, mid-October, and after the election in November to chart how their opinions and feelings shift over the presidential election cycle.\n\nOther key findings:\n\nIf the election were held today, 43% of respondents would vote for Kamala Harris and 42% would vote for Donald Trump.\n\nMost Americans don't trust the losing party to accept the election results. Only 16% of Democrats think Republicans will accept election results if their candidate loses in November, and only 15% of Republican election deniers think Democrats will accept the results if their candidate loses (50% of the other Republicans think Democrats will accept the results of a losing result).\n\nMajorities of all voters agreed that violence is not justified to prevent an opposing party from controlling the country.\n\nJohns Hopkins University is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit institution that does not endorse or oppose any candidate for public office.",

        "text": "About 3 in 4 U.S. adults say the 2024 election will determine the fate of U.S. democracy\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Roughly 3 in 4 American adults believe the upcoming presidential election is vital to the future of U.S. democracy, although which candidate they think poses the greater threat depends on their political leanings, according to a poll.\n\nThe survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds that most Democrats, Republicans and independents see the election as \u201cvery important\u201d or \u201cextremely important\u201d to democracy, while Democrats have a higher level of intensity about the issue. More than half of Democrats say the November election is \u201cextremely important\u201d to the future of U.S. democracy, compared to about 4 in 10 independents and Republicans.\n\nDemocrat Pamela Hanson, 67, of Amery, Wisconsin, said she has grave concerns for the future of democracy in the country if Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump gets elected.\n\n\u201cHis statements tend towards him being a king or a dictator, a person in charge by himself,\u201d Hanson said. \u201cI mean, the man is unhinged in my opinion.\u201d\n\nBut Republican Ernie Wagner from Liberty, New York, said it\u2019s President Joe Biden\u2019s administration \u2014 of which Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, is a part \u2014 that has abused the power of the executive branch.\n\n\u201cBiden has tried to erase the student loans, and he\u2019s been told by the courts that it\u2019s unconstitutional to do that,\u201d said Wagner, 85. \u201cHe\u2019s weaponized the FBI to get at his political opponents.\u201d\n\nThe poll findings suggest that many Democrats continue to view Trump as a threat to democracy after he tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election, embraced the rioters who attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and threatened to seek retribution against his opponents if he wins reelection.\n\nBut they also indicate that many of Trump\u2019s supporters agree with him that Biden is the real threat to democracy. Trump and his allies have accused Biden of weaponizing the Justice Department as it has pursued charges against the former president over his effort to halt certification of the 2020 election and keeping classified documents, though there is no evidence Biden has had any involvement or influence in the cases.\n\nTrump has framed himself as a defender of American values and portrayed Biden as a \u201cdestroyer\u201d of democracy. He said multiple times after he survived an assassination attempt last month that he \u201ctook a bullet for democracy.\u201d\n\nThe poll, conducted in the days after Biden dropped out of the race and Harris announced her campaign, is an early glimpse of Americans\u2019 views of a reshaped contest.\n\nMajorities of both Democrats and Republicans say democracy could be at risk in this election depending on who wins the presidency, responses generally in line with the findings when the question was last asked in an AP-NORC poll in December 2023.\n\nHanson, the Wisconsin Democrat, said she worries Trump in a second term would use the conservative-dominated U.S. Supreme Court to overrule important freedoms. She also is concerned that he would fill his Cabinet with loyalists who don\u2019t care about the well-being of everyone in the country and defund agencies that regulate key functions of society.\n\nBut Wagner, the New York Republican, brushed off those concerns and pointed to Trump\u2019s time in office.\n\n\u201cWhen he was in the White House, we had peace, we had prosperity, we had energy independence,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s undemocratic about that?\u201d\n\nHe said he didn\u2019t think Trump\u2019s intentions leading up to and on Jan. 6 were criminal.\n\n\u201cI just think he was misguided,\u201d Wagner said.\n\nSome independents also are carefully considering the stakes of the upcoming election on the country\u2019s democratic future.\n\n\u201cI believe that this is the most important election of my lifetime,\u201d said 53-year-old Patricia Seliga-Williams of LaVale, Maryland, an independent who is leaning toward voting for Harris.\n\nSeliga-Williams said she\u2019s barely scraping by on $15 an hour as a hotel breakfast attendant and remembers Trump handling the economy and immigration well. But she didn\u2019t like it when he recently quipped that he plans to be a \u201cdictator\u201d on day one in office.\n\n\u201cWe all know Donald Trump could run the country,\u201d she said. \u201cBut he\u2019s just too aggressive anymore, and I don\u2019t think I can trust that as a voter.\u201d\n\nNot everyone agrees that this year\u2019s presidential election will be an inflection point for the country\u2019s democracy, offering starkly different reasons, according to the AP-NORC poll. About 2 in 10 Americans say democracy in the U.S. is strong enough to withstand the outcome of the election no matter who wins, while another 2 in 10 believe democracy is already so seriously broken that the outcome doesn\u2019t matter.\n\nThe poll also shows the stakes of democracy in the election are felt more by older adults rather than younger ones. About half of adults 45 and older say the outcome of the election is extremely important for the future of democracy, compared to about 4 in 10 adults under 45.\n\n\u201cMaking the claim that the other candidate is trying to destroy democracy, it doesn\u2019t really land for me,\u201d said Daniel Oliver, 26, an independent from suburban Detroit. \u201cI think that we have things in place that should safeguard against when you kind of play at destroying democracy. We have other branches of government. We have people that believe in voting. So, it would be hard for a candidate to take over and become some kind of dictator.\u201d\n\nHe said he\u2019ll be looking for candidates to talk about issues he\u2019s more interested in, such as reducing inflation and investing in clean energy sources.\n\nBiden and Trump spent months sparring over whose second term would be worse for democracy. The president nodded to the consequences when he ended his campaign last month, saying in his Oval Office address that \u201cthe defense of democracy is more important than any title.\u201d\n\nHarris has focused more on the concept of \u201cfreedom\u201d in the early days of her campaign. She has said Trump\u2019s reelection could result in Americans losing the freedom to vote, the freedom to be safe from gun violence and the freedom for women to make decisions about their own bodies. Her debut campaign ad last month was set to Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s 2016 track \u201cFreedom,\u201d and it has become a campaign anthem for her at rallies ever since.\n\nHarris didn\u2019t mention democracy in her first two presidential campaign rallies, but she returned to the topic in remarks to Sigma Gamma Rho sorority members in Houston last week, saying \u201cour fundamental freedoms are on the ballot, and so is our democracy.\u201d\n\nThe poll of 1,143 adults was conducted July 25-29, 2024, using a sample drawn from NORC\u2019s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 4.1 percentage points.",

They've laid the groundwork for influence campaigns on trending election-related topics and begun to activate these campaigns in an apparent effort to stir up controversy or sway voters \u2013 especially in swing states .

        "text": "Iran Targeting 2024 US Election\nToday we\u2019re sharing intelligence about activity we\u2019ve been tracking that increasingly points to Iran\u2019s intent to influence this year\u2019s US presidential election. In recent weeks, groups connected with the Iranian government have upped two kinds of activity. First, they\u2019ve laid the groundwork for influence campaigns on trending election-related topics and begun to activate these campaigns in an apparent effort to stir up controversy or sway voters \u2013 especially in swing states. Second, they\u2019ve launched operations that Microsoft assesses are designed to gain intelligence on political campaigns and help enable them to influence the elections in the future.\n\nWe discuss this activity in a new report we released today, which details this activity, and four examples illuminate what we can increasingly expect from Iran as we near November.\n\nOne Iranian group has been launching covert news sites targeting US voter groups on opposing ends of the political spectrum. One of the sites, called Nio Thinker, caters to left-leaning audiences and insults former president Donald Trump, calling him an \u201copioid-pilled elephant in the MAGA china shop\u201d and a \u201craving mad litigiosaur.\u201d Another, called Savannah Time, claims to be a \u201ctrusted source for conservative news in the vibrant city of Savannah\u201d and focuses on topics including LGBTQ+ issues and gender reassignment. The evidence we found suggests the sites are using AI-enabled services to plagiarize at least some of their content from US publications.\n\nA separate Iranian group has been setting the groundwork for US-focused influence operations since March. We believe this group may be setting itself up for activities that are even more extreme, including intimidation or inciting violence against political figures or groups, with the ultimate goals of inciting chaos, undermining authorities, and sowing doubt about election integrity.\n\nYet another Iranian group, this one connected with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or IRGC, sent a spear phishing email in June to a high-ranking official on a presidential campaign from the compromised email account of a former senior advisor. The email contained a link that would direct traffic through a domain controlled by the group before routing to the website of the provided link. Within days of this activity, the same group unsuccessfully attempted to log into an account belonging to a former presidential candidate. We\u2019ve since notified those targeted.\n\nA fourth Iranian group compromised an account of a county-level government employee in a swing state. The compromise was part of a broader password spray operation and Microsoft Threat Intelligence did not observe the actor gain additional access beyond the single account, making it hard to discern the group\u2019s ultimate objectives. Since early 2023, the group\u2019s operations have focused on strategic intelligence collection particularly in satellite, defense, and health sectors with some targeting of US government organizations, often in swing states.\n\nThe Microsoft Threat Intelligence Report we\u2019re releasing today is from the Microsoft Threat Analysis Center, or MTAC, which tracks influence operations from specific nation-state groups around the world. MTAC routinely tracks threats to elections as part of Microsoft\u2019s broader Democracy Forward work and this builds on work the team did to track threats to recent elections in India, the UK, and France. Today\u2019s update also includes activity we have observed by actors advancing the geopolitical goals of Russia and China, each to varying degrees of effectiveness.\n\nWe share intelligence like this so voters, government institutions, candidates, parties, and others can be aware of influence campaigns and protect themselves from threats. We\u2019ve also been training candidates and parties involved in elections this year, building on our longstanding offerings, like AccountGuard. Finally, Microsoft will not endorse a candidate or political party. Our goal in releasing these reports is to underscore the importance of combating election deepfakes and promoting education and learning about possible foreign interference.\n\nTags: AI, Iran, MTAC",

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) FILE \u2013 Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz arrive at a campaign rally in Philadelphia, Aug. 6, 2024. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke)\n\nThe survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds that most Democrats, Republicans and independents see the election as \u201cvery important\u201d or \u201cextremely important\u201d to democracy, while Democrats have a higher level of intensity about the issue. More than half of Democrats say the November election is \u201cextremely important\u201d to the future of U.S. democracy, compared to about 4 in 10 independents and Republicans.\n\nDemocrat Pamela Hanson, 67, of Amery, Wisconsin, said she has grave concerns for the future of democracy in the country if Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump gets elected.\n\n\u201cHis statements tend towards him being a king or a dictator, a person in charge by himself,\u201d Hanson said. \u201cI mean, the man is unhinged in my opinion.\u201d\n\nBut Republican Ernie Wagner from Liberty, New York, said it\u2019s President Joe Biden\u2019s administration \u2014 of which Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, is a part \u2014 that has abused the power of the executive branch.\n\n\u201cBiden has tried to erase the student loans, and he\u2019s been told by the courts that it\u2019s unconstitutional to do that,\u201d said Wagner, 85. \u201cHe\u2019s weaponized the FBI to get at his political opponents.\u201d\n\nThe poll findings suggest that many Democrats continue to view Trump as a threat to democracy after he tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election, embraced the rioters who attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and threatened to seek retribution against his opponents if he wins reelection.\n\nBut they also indicate that many of Trump\u2019s supporters agree with him that Biden is the real threat to democracy. Trump and his allies have accused Biden of weaponizing the Justice Department as it has pursued charges against the former president over his effort to halt certification of the 2020 election and keeping classified documents, though there is no evidence Biden has had any involvement or influence in the cases.\n\nTrump has framed himself as a defender of American values and portrayed Biden as a \u201cdestroyer\u201d of democracy. He said multiple times after he survived an assassination attempt last month that he \u201ctook a bullet for democracy.\u201d\n\nThe poll, conducted in the days after Biden dropped out of the race and Harris announced her campaign, is an early glimpse of Americans\u2019 views of a reshaped contest.\n\nMajorities of both Democrats and Republicans say democracy could be at risk in this election depending on who wins the presidency, responses generally in line with the findings when the question was last asked in an AP-NORC poll in December 2023.\n\nHanson, the Wisconsin Democrat, said she worries Trump in a second term would use the conservative-dominated U.S. Supreme Court to overrule important freedoms. She also is concerned that he would fill his Cabinet with loyalists who don\u2019t care about the well-being of everyone in the country and defund agencies that regulate key functions of society.\n\nBut Wagner, the New York Republican, brushed off those concerns and pointed to Trump\u2019s time in office.\n\n\u201cWhen he was in the White House, we had peace, we had prosperity, we had energy independence,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s undemocratic about that?\u201d\n\nHe said he didn\u2019t think Trump\u2019s intentions leading up to and on Jan. 6 were criminal.\n\n\u201cI just think he was misguided,\u201d Wagner said.\n\nSome independents also are carefully considering the stakes of the upcoming election on the country\u2019s democratic future.\n\n\u201cI believe that this is the most important election of my lifetime,\u201d said 53-year-old Patricia Seliga-Williams of LaVale, Maryland, an independent who is leaning toward voting for Harris.\n\nSeliga-Williams said she\u2019s barely scraping by on $15 an hour as a hotel breakfast attendant and remembers Trump handling the economy and immigration well. But she didn\u2019t like it when he recently quipped that he plans to be a \u201cdictator\u201d on day one in office.\n\n\u201cWe all know Donald Trump could run the country,\u201d she said. \u201cBut he\u2019s just too aggressive anymore, and I don\u2019t think I can trust that as a voter.\u201d\n\nNot everyone agrees that this year\u2019s presidential election will be an inflection point for the country\u2019s democracy, offering starkly different reasons, according to the AP-NORC poll. About 2 in 10 Americans say democracy in the U.S. is strong enough to withstand the outcome of the election no matter who wins, while another 2 in 10 believe democracy is already so seriously broken that the outcome doesn\u2019t matter.\n\nThe poll also shows the stakes of democracy in the election are felt more by older adults rather than younger ones. About half of adults 45 and older say the outcome of the election is extremely important for the future of democracy, compared to about 4 in 10 adults under 45.\n\n\u201cMaking the claim that the other candidate is trying to destroy democracy, it doesn\u2019t really land for me,\u201d said Daniel Oliver, 26, an independent from suburban Detroit. \u201cI think that we have things in place that should safeguard against when you kind of play at destroying democracy. We have other branches of government. We have people that believe in voting. So, it would be hard for a candidate to take over and become some kind of dictator.\u201d\n\nHe said he\u2019ll be looking for candidates to talk about issues he\u2019s more interested in, such as reducing inflation and investing in clean energy sources.\n\nBiden and Trump spent months sparring over whose second term would be worse for democracy. The president nodded to the consequences when he ended his campaign last month, saying in his Oval Office address that \u201cthe defense of democracy is more important than any title.\u201d\n\nHarris has focused more on the concept of \u201cfreedom\u201d in the early days of her campaign. She has said Trump\u2019s reelection could result in Americans losing the freedom to vote, the freedom to be safe from gun violence and the freedom for women to make decisions about their own bodies. Her debut campaign ad last month was set to Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s 2016 track \u201cFreedom,\u201d and it has become a campaign anthem for her at rallies ever since.\n\nHarris didn\u2019t mention democracy in her first two presidential campaign rallies, but she returned to the topic in remarks to Sigma Gamma Rho sorority members in Houston last week, saying \u201cour fundamental freedoms are on the ballot, and so is our democracy.\u201d\n\n___\n\nThe poll of 1,143 adults was conducted July 25-29, 2024, using a sample drawn from NORC\u2019s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 4.1 percentage points.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press receives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

Vice President Harris and former President Trump have both confirmed they will attend the ABC debate. https://t.co/DEBOGC2ovO pic.twitter.com/t0KAWpcYOY \u2014 ABC News (@ABC) August 8, 2024\n\nHarris and Walz have headlined rallies in the battleground states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin this week, drawing tens of thousands of attendees in a new sign of how her late entry into the race has energised Democrats.\n\nHer rapid rise has sent Trump\u2019s team scrambling to recalibrate their strategy and messaging. Opinion polls suggest Harris has erased \u2013 or at least shrunk \u2013 the lead Trump had built over Biden.\n\nDemocrats have also raked in hundreds of millions of dollars from voters and big donors in a matter of weeks.\n\nAsked on Thursday how he has altered his approach to the new challenge from Harris, Trump insisted he has not done so.\n\nIn a question-and-answer session with reporters that stretched longer than an hour, Trump moved from topic to topic, claiming Harris and Walz were weak candidates who were already dropping in the polls.\n\nDespite that, he lamented that he would not be able to face Biden in the election, suggesting that the president was a victim of an unconstitutional plot to dislodge him from atop the Democratic ticket.\n\nBiden, 81, dropped his faltering re-election bid under pressure from fellow Democrats worried about his chances of victory in the November 5 election after a disastrous debate performance against Trump.\n\nReporting from Washington, DC, Al Jazeera\u2019s Rob Reynolds said Trump has been attacking Harris\u2019s intelligence while pushing on with his usual anti-immigration rhetoric.\n\n\u201cThere were certainly a lot of familiar sort of rancorous remarks in this press conference about crowd size,\u201d Reynolds said. \u201cThe Republican candidate Donald Trump seemed to get very, very upset when there was some suggestion that Kamla Harris was drawing large crowds. So he went on an extended riff about that.\u201d\n\nEchoing a recent criticism from his campaign, Trump criticised Harris on Thursday for not doing a news interview since launching her campaign.\n\n\u201cShe can\u2019t do an interview. She\u2019s barely competent,\u201d Trump said, later again calling her \u201cnasty\u201d, a go-to line that he often uses to disparage female critics.\n\nTrump has conducted a steady stream of media interviews, though many are usually with friendly, right-leaning outlets and reporters. On Wednesday, he called into the Fox & Friends morning programme and took questions from the hosts.\n\nHarris and Walz were meeting with autoworkers in Detroit on Thursday, following the United Auto Workers union\u2019s endorsement of their candidacy, as part of a push to mobilise blue-collar workers in key battleground states.\n\nThe Harris campaign cancelled events on Thursday in North Carolina and on Friday in Georgia, where Tropical Storm Debby is bringing heavy rain and dangerous flooding. The Democrats will head to Arizona and Nevada later this week, visiting two more swing states likely to play a key role in the election.\n\nTrump\u2019s running mate, Senator JD Vance of Ohio, also cancelled campaign events in North Carolina on Thursday due to the storm. He has spent the last few days trailing Harris and Walz around the country, an unusual move intended to provide a \u201ccontrast\u201d, he told reporters on Wednesday.",

        "text": "August 7, 2024, presidential campaign news\nTim Walz speaks at a campaign rally on August 7. Julia Nikhinson/AP\n\nGov. Tim Walz, Kamala Harris\u2019 vice presidential running mate, refused to drop out of his congressional race in 2005 despite an Army National Guard announcement of a possible deployment, according to a statement from his campaign at the time.\n\nOhio Sen. JD Vance, Donald Trump\u2019s running mate, accused Walz of ducking service in Iraq when he left the guard and ran for Congress in 2005.\n\nWalz served in the Army National Guard for 24 years before retiring in 2005. He launched a campaign for Congress in Minnesota\u2019s 1st Congressional District that year and was elected in November 2006.\n\nWalz filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission as a candidate for Congress on February 10, 2005. The next month, after the guard announced a possible deployment to Iraq within two years, Walz\u2019s campaign issued a statement saying he intended to stay in the race.\n\n\u201cI do not yet know if my artillery unit will be part of this mobilization and I am unable to comment further on specifics of the deployment,\u201d Walz said in the March 2005 campaign release.\n\n\u201cAs Command Sergeant Major I have a responsibility not only to ready my battalion for Iraq, but also to serve if called on. I am dedicated to serving my country to the best of my ability, whether that is in Washington DC or in Iraq,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to speculate on what shape my campaign will take if I am deployed, but I have no plans to drop out of the race. I am fortunate to have a strong group of enthusiastic supporters and a very dedicated and intelligent wife. Both will be a major part of my campaign, whether I am in Minnesota or Iraq.\u201d\n\nWalz retired from the Army National Guard in May 2005, according to the Minnesota National Guard. Service members often submit their paperwork for retirement months before their retirement date.

Charles Rex Arbogast/AP\n\nGov. Tim Walz, Kamala Harris\u2019 vice presidential running mate, refused to drop out of his congressional race in 2005 despite an Army National Guard announcement of a possible deployment, according to a statement from his campaign at the time.\n\nOhio Sen. JD Vance, Donald Trump\u2019s running mate, accused Walz of ducking service in Iraq when he left the guard and ran for Congress in 2005.\n\nWalz served in the Army National Guard for 24 years before retiring in 2005. He launched a campaign for Congress in Minnesota\u2019s 1st Congressional District that year and was elected in November 2006.\n\nWalz filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission as a candidate for Congress on February 10, 2005. The next month, after the guard announced a possible deployment to Iraq within two years, Walz\u2019s campaign issued a statement saying he intended to stay in the race.\n\n\u201cI do not yet know if my artillery unit will be part of this mobilization and I am unable to comment further on specifics of the deployment,\u201d Walz said in the March 2005 campaign release.\n\n\u201cAs Command Sergeant Major I have a responsibility not only to ready my battalion for Iraq, but also to serve if called on. I am dedicated to serving my country to the best of my ability, whether that is in Washington DC or in Iraq,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to speculate on what shape my campaign will take if I am deployed, but I have no plans to drop out of the race. I am fortunate to have a strong group of enthusiastic supporters and a very dedicated and intelligent wife. Both will be a major part of my campaign, whether I am in Minnesota or Iraq.\u201d\n\nWalz retired from the Army National Guard in May 2005, according to the Minnesota National Guard. Service members often submit their paperwork for retirement months before their retirement date. It\u2019s unclear when Walz submitted his papers for retirement.\n\nIn a 2009 interview for the Library of Congress, Tim Walz said he left the Army National Guard to focus full time on running for Congress, citing concerns about trying to serve at the same time and the Hatch Act, which limits political activities for federal employees.\n\n\u201cI left in April of 2005 and for me it was just short of 25 years and it was to run for this office.

        "text": "Young women are the most progressive group in American history. Young men are checked out\nView image in fullscreen Photograph: Guardian design\n\nWhen Donald Trump strutted on to the stage at the Republican national convention last month, it was to a raucous cover of James Brown\u2019s It\u2019s a Man\u2019s Man\u2019s Man\u2019s World. The song credits men with inventing cars, trains, lights, boats, toys and commerce. The message was not subtle. At least, not to Melissa Deckman.\n\n\u201cThis idea of America needing someone who is a strong masculine figure \u2013 I think the Republican campaign this year is doing it even in a more pronounced and overt way than it did in 2016,\u201d said Deckman, CEO of the Public Religion Research Institute. \u201cYou have a lot of younger men admiring the strength of Trump \u2013 or what they think is strong.\u201d\n\nDeckman would know. In her forthcoming book The Politics of Gen Z: How the Youngest Voters Will Shape Our Democracy, she dives into the deep political divides between gen Z women and men and explores how they feel about growing up in the Trump era. Based on interviews with roughly 90 gen Z political activists, numerous focus groups and extensive polling, Deckman has identified what she calls a \u201chistoric reverse gender gap\u201d.\n\nView image in fullscreen Melissa Deckman has found that gen Z men are more conservative than their millennial counterparts. Photograph: Charles Belt/Melissa Deckman\n\nShe has found that gen Z men are becoming more conservative as well as increasingly indifferent to politics, bucking longstanding trends, dating back at least to the 1970s, that saw young people across the board voting liberal and men being generally more involved in politics than women. Meanwhile, gen Z women have not only become the most progressive cohort in US history but are also expected to outpace their male peers across virtually every measure of political involvement, such as donating money, volunteering for campaigns, registering people to vote \u2013 and, of course, voting.\n\nYoung women were outstripping men on political engagement well before Joe Biden stepped aside in favor of Kamala Harris, setting the internet ablaze with memes and teeing up yet another presidential contest between Trump and a woman. Now, with Harris the presumptive Democratic nominee, a generation already riven by a canyon-wide political gender gap is watching a contest between a woman who could become the nation\u2019s first Black and south Asian female president and a man who likes calling women \u201cnasty\u201d.\n\n\u201cFor me, the question come November is gonna be: to what extent do attitudes about gender influence the vote for Trump?\u201d Deckman asked.\n\nPolls indicate that young men\u2019s views on gender, femininity and masculinity are rapidly shifting. In 2022, 49% of gen Z men said that the United States had become \u201ctoo soft and feminine\u201d, Deckman found. Just a year later, 60% of gen Z men said the same. Deckman found that those who agreed with the statement were far more likely to have voted for Trump in 2016 \u2013 even after controlling for political party.\n\nNo matter their age, women have long voted at higher rates than men \u2013 but that is the only political activity where they have consistently exceeded men. Men historically donated more, volunteered with campaigns more and otherwise participated in political life more. This year, Deckman believes young women will surpass young men not only at voting, but in all political activities.\n\nDemocrats have historically had a firm grip on voters under 30 \u2013 a grip they may now be losing. Gen Z men, Deckman noted, have \u201creverted to the mean of men\u201d: while they\u2019re not necessarily more conservative that most men, they are more conservative than their millennial counterparts.\n\nNot all men\n\nThese trends are even more pronounced among white gen Z men. If you combine the number of independent gen Z men who lean Republican with those who identify as Republicans, Deckman said, young white men \u201clook very conservative compared to even older white men\u201d. She believes Trump will probably win young white men.\n\nIn 2020, 49% of white men between the ages of 18 and 29 voted for Biden, according to an analysis of AP VoteCast data by the Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement. Meanwhile, 42% voted for Trump.\n\nThe damage that could do to Harris, however, is mitigated by the fact that white men make up a shrinking segment of gen Z. About half of gen Z is white, making it the most diverse generation in US history. Several polls have suggested that Trump could win among young Black and Latino men \u2013 a claim that Deckman eyes with suspicion, especially since Harris has entered the race and the GOP seems unable to stop themselves from making racist comments about her. Some Republicans have started calling Harris the \u201cfirst DEI president\u201d.\n\nDeckman\u2019s surveys have found that gen Z men are less likely than their female counterparts to say that racial equality is important to them, but 45% do believe that it\u2019s important, including 52% of Black gen Z men.\n\n\u201cIf Donald Trump uses misogynistic, racist language toward Kamala Harris, I think the net effect for young men will be more off-putting than not,\u201d Deckman said. \u201cThe end result for him is a net negative. It\u2019s also, of course, wrong.\u201d\n\n\u2018They don\u2019t care\u2019\n\nAnother mitigating factor could help Harris: young men don\u2019t seem all that interested in politics, period.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t care,\u201d Deckman said. In surveys, \u201cI asked them: what are you passionate about? What issues are critically important to you? There\u2019s like 20% gaps between young men and young women on everything.\u201d\n\nIn addition to caring more about issues like LGBTQ+ rights and abortion, as might be expected, gen Z women care more about economic issues like inflation, jobs and unemployment, which are typically thought to be more important to men. (LGBTQ+ zoomers also cared equally or more about every issue than straight zoomers.) Even men who agree that the US is too \u201csoft and feminine\u201d don\u2019t feel more motivated to act. Instead, it is Democratic women who reject that notion who tend to get more involved in politics.\n\nWhile young men fall behind women in political engagement, women have, over the last few decades, gone to college and joined the workforce at higher and higher rates. These trends are not unrelated. The more education and money you have, the more likely you are to be invested in politics.\n\nFeeling like your rights are under \u201cdirect threat\u201d also increases political involvement \u2013 and in the age of Trump, #MeToo and the fall of Roe v Wade, plenty of gen Z women feel like their rights are under threat. Gen Z men just don\u2019t feel the same urgency.\n\nSurprisingly, there is one area of political involvement where young men and women feel similarly: they are both deeply uninterested in running for office. Women have long been less interested in running for office than men. But as of 2022, Deckman found, only 6% of gen Z men said they definitely planned to run for office, while 4% of gen Z women said the same. Despite women\u2019s political enthusiasm, zoomers as a whole remain unconvinced that joining government is worth it.\n\n\u201cGen Z is far less likely to be confident in the federal government, in the media, in organized religion, in the police, in the criminal justice system,\u201d Deckman said. \u201cThis is just endemic to a generation of young people who have grown up in one crisis after another.\u201d",

These bribes were allegedly paid to obtain and retain business related to providing voting machines and election services for the 2016 Philippine elections and to secure payments on the contracts, including the release of value added tax payments.\n\nThe co-conspirators allegedly funded the bribes through a slush fund that was created by over-invoicing the cost per voting machine for the 2016 Philippine elections. To conceal and disguise the nature and purpose of the corrupt payments, the co-conspirators used coded language to refer to the slush fund and caused the creation of fraudulent contracts and sham loan agreements to justify transfers. The co-conspirators then allegedly laundered funds related to the bribery scheme through bank accounts located in Asia, Europe, and the United States, including in the Southern District of Florida.\n\nPinate and Vasquez are each charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and one substantive violation of the FCPA. Bautista, Pinate, Vasquez, and Elie Moreno, 44, a dual citizen of Venezuela and Israel, are each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering and three counts of international laundering of monetary instruments. If convicted, Pinate and Vasquez each face a maximum penalty of five years in prison for the FCPA and conspiracy to violate the FCPA counts. Bautista, Pinate, Vasquez, and Moreno each face a maximum penalty of 20 years for each count of international laundering of monetary instruments and conspiracy to commit money laundering.\n\nPrincipal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Nicole M.

        "text": "Comparing the 2024 Presidential Candidates\u2019 Energy Agendas\nThe 2024 GOP Platform supports deregulation and incentives for traditional energy sources like coal, oil, natural gas, and some renewables. During the former President\u2019s term, he rolled back more than 100 environmental rules and former Trump colleagues have outlined a plan to continue to do the same. The Republican Vice Presidential candidate, JD Vance, has shown limited support for or opposition to most climate policies but has supported regulation as a response to environmental health, such as toxic spills.\n\nThe Biden-Harris administration supports investment in clean energy through the Inflation Reduction Act and various initiatives, including Justice40, which supports environmental justice efforts. Vice President Harris is expected to continue these actions with a potentially more progressive climate stance if elected. She previously supported a fracking ban, but has since reversed her opinion. Harris may emphasize environmental justice in her campaign but has yet to provide a formal plan. The Democratic Vice Presidential candidate, Tim Walz, has mostly aligned with Biden-Harris policies, at times going further to cut emissions, while also working with oil companies to rebuild the Line 3 pipeline project.\n\nMeanwhile, as of 2023, most Americans want the U.S. president to do more to address global warming.\n\nThe President can enact or dismantle energy policy in various ways. Here is a comparison of the candidates\u2019 energy policies and the mechanisms they might use. (Harris\u2019s specific 2025 energy policy goals are not included.)\n\nNote: please click on this image to see the detailed text.\n\nEasy to Execute\n\nExecutive Order and Agency Regulation\n\nTargeted Policies:\n\nEmissions targets\n\nInternational agreements and participation\n\nAgency initiatives and organization\n\nRegulating emissions can be targeted through executive orders, like Order 14057, or actions. Trump plans to exit the Paris Climate Accords and remove U.S. emissions targets, which are currently set to be reduced by 52% by 2030. During former President Trump\u2019s term, his administration rolled back more than 100 environmental rules , and Project 2025, a document created by the Heritage Foundation, outlines a plan to continue this effort.\n\nProject 2025 aims to remove renewable research or other science research groups within the Department of Energy. While the president has reorganization authority, there could be challenges with leaving allocated funding unused if the IRA already specified this money.\n\nWhile Americans have mixed views on natural gas, oil, and drilling, most support taxing polluters. Both candidates support \u201cenergy independence\u201d and reducing reliance on other countries. Both the Biden and Trump administrations have overseen a time in which the U.S. has led global oil production.\n\nA Trump presidency could reduce regulation and hurdles for oil and gas companies. Trump has called for tax cuts for U.S. oil and gas companies. Executive orders and rewriting the tax code could accomplish these goals, but they may require congressional support.\n\nA Harris presidency could continue to face legal battles on permitting action, such as limiting leasing on federal lands, withdrawing the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline, and pausing approvals of new liquified natural gas exports. Harris has historically been slightly stricter on oil regulation than President Biden.\n\nBoth parties support expedited permitting, with Trump preferring traditional fuels, often done through an executive order instructing how agencies act on legislation.\n\nModerately Difficult to Achieve\n\nTax Regulation and Unallocated Congressional Funding\n\nTargeted Policies:\n\nRenewable energy project funding\n\nEfficiency standards for homes and vehicles\n\nMany proposed policies can be achieved through re-writing the tax code, pausing non-obligated funds, or changing how federal agencies allocate loans. Due to the recent ruling overturning Chevron deference, Trump would have more capacity to do so in this term, while Harris may see challenges disseminating funds where policy is ambiguous.\n\nThe IRA and Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors and Science (CHIPS ) Act are unlikely to be canceled without congressional action. A second Trump term would face challenges to repeal promised tax breaks completely, such as tax credit eligibility for electric vehicles, efficient vehicles, or appliances.\n\nGenerally, renewable projects like solar farms may face delays due to increased tariffs and shifting manufacturing priorities. Trump has previously expressed that he would implement an executive order targeting offshore wind. Still, it would be difficult to do more than pause loans and rewrite tax laws to slow the trajectory of renewable production.\n\nWith bills such as the IRA, CHIPS Act, and related executive orders already in place, continuing these efforts under a Harris presidency would likely not be as difficult as removing them.\n\nDifficult to Accomplish\n\nWithhold Congressional Spending\n\nFormer President Trump has pledged to cut wasteful spending within the federal budget, which is interpreted to include dismantling specific agency sections and rules. Congress sets the federal budget, and the president does not have the authority to withhold appropriated spending. Such action would require significant effort from the other government branches.\n\nWhile dismantling energy policy may be more difficult than during Trump\u2019s 2016 term, emissions projections reflect a need to continue and potentially double renewable energy and decarbonization to meet 2050 targets.",

        "text": "\u2018Our lives are on the line\u2019: Why many LGBTQ+ people hope for a Harris win\nAt a recent celebration of San Francisco\u2019s vibrant transgender past, one speaker after another directed the crowd\u2019s attention to a worrisome future, casting November\u2019s presidential election as a turning point for the LGBTQ+ community and the nation as a whole.\n\n\u201cThis election will determine our fate,\u201d said Sof\u00eda Sabina R\u00edos Dorantes, deputy director of El/La Para TransLatinas, a local advocacy organization. \u201cIt will determine whether we continue to face discrimination and marginalization at [a] disproportionate rate, or whether we can continue walking toward the recognition and respect we deserve.\u201d\n\nFor the record: An earlier version of this article referred to an event in San Francisco as a celebration of Transgender Pride Month. The celebration marked Transgender History Month.\n\nLast week\u2019s third annual kickoff to Transgender History Month \u2014 the first to be recognized at the state level as well \u2014 was a chance to celebrate the advances of the transgender community in one of the nation\u2019s most enduring havens for LGBTQ+ people, with champagne served beneath the ornate dome of San Francisco City Hall. It was also a show of defiance at a dangerous time for queer folks nationally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThousands participate in the All Black Lives Matter solidarity march to mark LGBTQ Pride Month along Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood in 2020. (Genaro Molina / Los Angeles Times)\n\nIn three months, Americans will choose between Vice President Kamala Harris, who is a Bay Area native and longtime LGBTQ+ ally, and former President Trump, who has a long record of attacking queer rights and has aligned himself with some of the nation\u2019s most virulently anti-LGBTQ+ political groups.\n\nIn chats with family and on nights out with friends, at gay bars and organizing meetings and on a virtual call of some 20,000 queer people last month, many LGBTQ+ Americans are making it increasingly clear that they view Trump and the broader Republican agenda as an existential threat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCalifornia Our Queerest Century With queer lives under threat, Our Queerest Century highlights the contributions of LGBTQ+ people since the 1924 founding of the nation\u2019s first gay rights organization.\n\n\u201cIt is not an exaggeration to say that our lives are on the line,\u201d said Honey Mahogany, executive director of the San Francisco Office of Transgender Initiatives. \u201cIt\u2019s whether or not we can survive \u2014 or will be in a position where we are in fear for our lives.\u201d\n\nIn advance of the 20,000-strong call hosted by the Human Rights Campaign last month, the group released a letter endorsing Harris from more than 1,100 LGBTQ+ leaders, organizers and celebrities.\n\nThe letter praised Harris for her decision as California attorney general to not defend Proposition 8, a state ballot measure that barred same-sex marriages, and for her support for the federal Equality Act, which would prohibit anti-LGBTQ+ discrimination in employment, housing and other areas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVice President Kamala Harris makes a surprise appearance at Capitol Pride DC in Washington in 2022. (Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times)\n\nThe letter heaped praise on the Biden-Harris administration as \u201cthe most pro-LGBTQ+ administration in history,\u201d noting its support for anti-discrimination policies and LGBTQ+ healthcare protections in the U.S. and its defense of LGBTQ+ rights globally.\n\nOn the call, Mawuli Tugbenyoh, senior co-chair of the Alice B. Toklas LGBTQ Democratic Club in San Francisco, said Harris has been a queer ally since before her first election as San Francisco district attorney in 2003 and is genuine in her allyship.\n\n\u201cVice President Harris has always been there for us and fought for our community every step of the way,\u201d Tugbenyoh said.\n\nOn Tuesday, queer rights groups also hailed Harris\u2019 selection of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate. They noted Walz has a record of allyship going back to the 1990s \u2014 when as a teacher he served as an advisor to his school\u2019s gay-straight alliance \u2014 and as governor has signed bills banning so-called conversion therapy and protecting gender-affirming care.\n\nThe same organizations have called Trump a major threat to queer families.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump appointed anti-LGBTQ+ officials throughout his administration. His Department of Education revoked school protections for transgender students, while his Justice and Health and Human Services departments rescinded anti-discrimination protections for transgender people, including in healthcare settings.\n\nTrump appointed a slate of judges viewed as anti-LGBTQ+ and banned transgender people from serving in the military \u2014 a policy President Biden reversed. In more recent years, Republicans aligned with Trump have introduced a flood of anti-LGBTQ+ bills at the local, state and federal levels, prompting the Human Rights Campaign to declare a \u201cstate of emergency\u201d for queer Americans last year.\n\nConcerns have only increased since Project 2025, a blueprint for a second Trump term produced by a host of former Trump aides, the Heritage Foundation and more than 100 other conservative groups, came into focus. The plan \u2014 which Trump has tried to distance himself from despite having close ties to its authors \u2014 challenges the existence of transgender people, calls the rainbow flag a \u201cdivisive symbol\u201d and demands a \u201cbiblically based\u201d definition of marriage and families.\n\nTrump\u2019s running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, who also has close ties to Project 2025 authors, has attacked LGBTQ+ rights and mocked queer people. Vance has opposed protections for same-sex marriage, LGBTQ+ workers and gender-affirming healthcare, called LGBTQ+ activists \u201cgroomers\u201d and held up the confirmation of overseas diplomats by questioning their support for LGBTQ+-friendly initiatives.\n\nTrump also has outlined various anti-LGBTQ+ policies in \u201cAgenda 47,\u201d his plan for a second term. It says Trump would end all federal programs \u201cthat promote the concept of sex and gender transition at any age,\u201d withhold Medicaid and Medicare funding from hospitals that provide gender-affirming care to children, ensure \u201csevere consequences\u201d for teachers who acknowledge transgender students\u2019 identities and revoke federal funding from their schools.\n\nHe concludes a campaign video about the plan with the demonstrably false assertion that the existence of transgender children \u201cwas never heard of\u201d until \u201cthe radical left invented it just a few years ago.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018We\u2019re not going back\u2019\n\nNot all LGBTQ+ people support Harris. Stephen Schumacher, a gay 33-year-old political consultant, helps lead the Detroit chapter of Log Cabin Republicans, an organization for conservative LGBTQ+ people. He supports Trump.\n\nSchumacher pointed to the Republican Party taking its long-standing opposition to same-sex marriage out of its platform this year \u2014 after Trump ordered the document be slimmed down \u2014 as proof the party is coming around on the issue. He said Log Cabin events he attended at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee last month were well received.\n\n\u201cI feel like my rights are protected,\u201d Schumacher said.\n\nRichard Grenell, a gay Trump loyalist and former acting director of national intelligence in the Trump administration, once called Trump \u201cthe most pro-gay president in American history\u201d and this week predicted the GOP nominee will \u201cwin 50% of the gay vote.\u201d\n\nGrenell, of California, has railed against transgender youth rights and the Equality Act and been flagged as anti-LGBTQ+ by queer rights groups. On Wednesday he took up a Republican talking point about Walz, saying that Minnesota protections around sexual orientation somehow benefit pedophiles.\n\nAcross the country, many queer people find such beliefs flabbergasting \u2014 if not repugnant.\n\nJim Obergefell, the lead plaintiff in the 2015 Supreme Court case that won same-sex couples the right to marry nationally, said it\u2019s obvious that LGBTQ+ rights \u2014 including the right to marry \u2014 are under threat.\n\nJim Obergefell, the lead plaintiff in Obergefell vs. Hodges, the Supreme Court case that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide, arrives for a news conference on the steps of the Texas Capitol in Austin in 2015. (Eric Gay / Associated Press)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe Republican Party has made clear through statements, through policies, through basically everything they have done, that they do not believe that queer people deserve the same rights, the same respect, the same dignity,\u201d Obergefell said.\n\nRep. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.), who is gay and serves as chair of the Congressional Equality Caucus, said LGBTQ+ people have watched in recent years as Republicans have launched one attack after another on gender-affirming care, Pride flags, drag queen story hours, queer books and the mere mention of being gay in schools, and know it will only get worse under Trump.\n\n\u201cIn the Republican Party, there is a real regression when it comes to equality, and I could see almost anything being pushed forward,\u201d Pocan said.\n\nAmong those attending the Transgender History Month celebration in San Francisco was state Sen. Scott Wiener, who is gay. \u201cWe know that there are forces in this country \u2014 and we\u2019re seeing it more broadly now with Project 2025 \u2014 [who] have never gotten over the fact that we\u2019re no longer in 1950 or 1850 or whatever it is that they want to bring us back to,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve never gotten over that, and they want all of us to go away.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Wiener said, \u201cwe\u2019re not going anywhere.\u201d\n\nDonna Personna, a 77-year-old transgender attendee who has lived in San Francisco since her teens, said Trump and other Republicans pretend people such as her never used to exist because they don\u2019t want to acknowledge that the American past they wish to see returned was a harsh and unjust place for so many.\n\nBy contrast, Harris has made \u201cWe\u2019re not going back\u201d a campaign slogan, Personna noted. \u201cAnd I\u2019m with her on that.\u201d",
