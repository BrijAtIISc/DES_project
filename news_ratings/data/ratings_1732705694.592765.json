        "text": "How swing states came to be critical in U.S. presidential elections\nHow swing states came to be critical in U.S. presidential elections\n\ntoggle caption Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nWhen Swarthmore, Pa., resident Scott Richardson first voted in a U.S. presidential election, it was for Democrat Jimmy Carter in 1976.\n\nRichardson cast his ballot for Republican Donald Trump in 2016. But after being disillusioned by Trump\u2019s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Richardson chose Democrat Joe Biden in the 2020 election.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost 50/50 who I have voted for,\u201d Richardson, a former restaurateur, said of the political affiliations of his chosen presidential candidates over the years. \u201cIt has never been related to [political] party. I kind of felt like I was voting for an individual.\u201d\n\nRichardson is a swing voter in a swing state; those few jurisdictions that sometimes vote Republican, sometimes vote Democratic and have the power to influence the results of national elections.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nMost states consistently vote red or blue \u2014 between 2000 and 2016, 38 states voted for the same political party \u2014 but swing states are less predictable.\n\nPolitical campaigns and pundits have long focused on states such as Pennsylvania because they offer candidates an opportunity to sway voters off the fence and win coveted Electoral College votes. In recent years, they\u2019ve also had the power to swing the election itself.\n\ntoggle caption Ronda Churchill/AFP via Getty Images\n\n\u201cSwing states have increasingly become not just states that flip back and forth, but states, given the relative polarization and certainty of other states voting particular ways, these are the small cluster of states that truly are going to decide the presidential election,\u201d said David Schultz, a professor of political science and legal studies at Hamline University and editor of Presidential Swing States: Why Only Ten Matter.\n\nWhat are swing states, anyway? How did so much political power come to be concentrated in just a few states? And is it fair?\n\n\n\nIt all starts with the Electoral College\n\nThe only reason the concept of a swing state exists at all is because of the unique way the U.S. conducts presidential elections: with the Electoral College.\n\nThe U.S. doesn\u2019t elect presidents based on the national popular vote. \u201cIt\u2019s essentially 50 separate state elections plus the District of Columbia,\u201d Schultz said. (In fact, two presidents have been elected in recent decades even though they lost the national popular vote \u2014 George W. Bush in 2000 and Trump in 2016.)\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAfter the election results are in, people known as electors, appointed by all 50 states and the District of Columbia, send their votes for president and vice president to Congress based on the results of the vote tally in their jurisdiction.\n\nMaine and Nebraska assign their electors proportionally, but the other 48 states and the District of Columbia have a winner-take-all system, meaning they assign all their electors to the candidate who wins a majority of the vote.\n\nIn most of the country, a candidate who wins a state by even a slim margin gets all of that state\u2019s electoral votes. The 2000 presidential election between Bush and Democrat Al Gore came down to a difference of just 537 votes in one swing state, Florida.\n\nAccording to Schultz, this is not what the Framers had in mind when they created a system they hoped would prevent larger states from having an unfair advantage in national elections.\n\ntoggle caption Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\n\u201cThe idea was that the Electoral College would prevent small states from being overlooked,\u201d he said. \u201cBut ... what we know is for at least 150 years, maybe even longer, that there are some states that are really decisive in the election.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhat is a swing state, anyway?\n\nAccording to Schultz, four different criteria determine a swing state:\n\nFirst, the state is a battleground. Presidential candidates and their campaigns visit these places often to stump for votes between Memorial Day and Labor Day.\n\nSecond, it\u2019s a competitive state. For Schultz, that means the margin of victory for the winning presidential candidate has been less than 5% of the vote.\n\nThird, this state would be considered a bellwether. In past elections, the candidate who won the state has gone on to win the presidency. Some states have been good predictors of who would ultimately end up in the White House.\n\nFourth is the so-called flippability factor. Does this state see-saw between political parties? For example, Pennsylvania went for Obama in 2012, Trump in 2016 and Biden in 2020.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nEven within swing states, not every voter is a swing voter. Schultz suggests that this year\u2019s presidential contest could hinge not simply on swing states but swing counties. He estimates that 5% of the voters in five counties in five states could determine the outcome of this year\u2019s contest.\n\n\u201cFor me, this presidential campaign is coming down to maybe 150,000 voters that are decisive,\u201d Schultz said.\n\nNPR has reported that Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Georgia, Michigan, Arizona, Wisconsin and Nevada will be the states to watch this fall.\n\n\n\nWhy do some states swing \u2014 and others don\u2019t?\n\nSwing states don\u2019t necessarily stay swing states forever, and other consistent performers can turn into toss-ups. Arizona only became a swing state recently, while longtime swing states such as Florida and Ohio have gone reliably Republican.\n\nPolitical experts say many factors can help transform a state into a swing state or turn a swing state solidly blue or red.\n\nFor example, increased political polarization is hardening partisan divides across the country.\n\nAlso, the movement of people around the U.S. for jobs, retirement and other reasons can cause demographic shifts \u2014 including fluctuations in a state\u2019s racial and ethnic makeup \u2014 that can alter the area\u2019s political fabric. Immigration may also play a role.\n\ntoggle caption Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s an interesting part of the puzzle, the migration patterns,\u201d said David Damore, a University of Nevada, Las Vegas professor of political science and coauthor of Blue Metros, Red States: The Shifting Urban/Rural Divide in America\u2019s Swing States. \u201cWhen blue state voters leave, where do they go? Do they bring their blue state politics?\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Damore noted that social issues are largely replacing economic differences and driving the political conversation in swing states. He cited several examples, including North Carolina\u2019s transgender bathroom bill in 2016 and Georgia\u2019s \u201cfetal heartbeat\u201d abortion law in 2019.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cRight now, what\u2019s become the sort of battleground is those second- and first-ring suburbs around the urban cores that used to be much more reliably Republican,\u201d he said. \u201cBut because of the shifting agenda and the emphasis on social issues, that has become certainly quite ripe for Democrats.\u201d\n\n\n\nHow swing states influence national politics\n\nBecause swing states are so important to the outcome of a presidential election, campaigns tend to spend a lot of money and time there.\n\n\u201cIt has huge implications for how resources get deployed,\u201d Damore said. \u201cIf you\u2019re in California, you really don\u2019t see a presidential election. You come to Nevada, you can\u2019t escape it.\u201d\n\nThe power of swing states can also dampen voter turnout in other parts of the U.S. where partisan majorities are stronger and people feel like their vote may not matter. If you know your state is going to go Republican, why vote for the Democrat, the thinking goes.\n\nSeveral studies have even suggested that politically crucial swing states may get some additional federal resources.\n\nFor Schultz, the outsize sway held by swing states, a power they derive from the Electoral College, has made presidential elections less fair, especially to voters in non-swing states across the U.S. hoping to have their voices heard.\n\n\u201cEven though the concept of \u2018one person one vote\u2019 is supposed to apply when it comes to presidential elections, \u2018one person one vote\u2019 does not mean equal influence,\u201d he said. \u201cSome votes effectively matter more than others.\u201d",

        "text": "Marking One Month Since Venezuela\u2019s Presidential Election\nIn the month since Venezuelans went to the polls, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his representatives have tampered with the results of that election, falsely claimed victory, and carried out wide-spread repression to maintain power. The United States applauds the courage and resilience of the millions of Venezuelans who voted and who continue to peacefully call for Maduro to acknowledge that Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia received the most votes. In spite of repeated calls from Venezuelans and the international community, the Maduro-controlled National Electoral Council (CNE) has failed to substantiate its announced results by producing original tally sheets, as it did following the 2013 and 2018 elections. The CNE\u2019s ongoing refusal to uphold international and Venezuelan standards of transparency or to respect the will of the Venezuelan people as expressed at the polls is an unacceptable violation of Venezuela\u2019s laws, as is the attempt by the Maduro-controlled Supreme Tribunal of Justice (TSJ) to silence the voices of the Venezuelan voters by ratifying the CNE\u2019s unsubstantiated announcement of a Maduro victory. In contrast, earlier this week, one of Venezuela\u2019s own CNE rectors confirmed that Maduro has provided no evidence that he won this election.\n\nInstead of responding to the Venezuelan people\u2019s demands for transparency and democracy, Maduro has ratcheted up repression through politically targeted threats, unjust and indiscriminate detentions, and censorship in a desperate attempt to hold onto power by force. Maduro\u2019s actions have exacerbated the Venezuelan crisis and left him increasingly isolated from the international community. The United States and international partners have called out Maduro and his representatives for their actions since the election:\n\nThe Organization of American States adopted a resolution by consensus on August 16 calling for transparency, impartial review, and protection of electoral integrity, in line with the region\u2019s commitment to uphold the Inter-American Democratic Charter.\n\nThe United States, EU, and more than 20 governments signed a joint statement August 16 in the Dominican Republic calling for electoral transparency in Venezuela.\n\nThe United States joined ten regional partners in issuing a joint statement on August 23 condemning the TSJ\u2019s decision to certify the CNE\u2019s claim Maduro won.\n\nThe United States joined with other nations August 28 to call a special session of the OAS Permanent Council to address the human rights impacts of the electoral crisis.\n\nThe United States repeats its call for a return to the respect of human rights and democratic norms in Venezuela, the release of all political prisoners, and an end to the arbitrary arrests and other acts of repression against members of the democratic opposition, media and civil society. Venezuelans have voted, the results are clear, and their will must be respected.",

        "text": "Key things to know about U.S. election polling in 2024\n(J Studios/Getty Images)\n\nConfidence in U.S. public opinion polling was shaken by errors in 2016 and 2020. In both years\u2019 general elections, many polls underestimated the strength of Republican candidates, including Donald Trump. These errors laid bare some real limitations of polling.\n\nIn the midterms that followed those elections, polling performed better. But many Americans remain skeptical that it can paint an accurate portrait of the public\u2019s political preferences.\n\nRestoring people\u2019s confidence in polling is an important goal, because robust and independent public polling has a critical role to play in a democratic society. It gathers and publishes information about the well-being of the public and about citizens\u2019 views on major issues. And it provides an important counterweight to people in power, or those seeking power, when they make claims about \u201cwhat the people want.\u201d\n\nThe challenges facing polling are undeniable. In addition to the longstanding issues of rising nonresponse and cost, summer 2024 brought extraordinary events that transformed the presidential race. The good news is that people with deep knowledge of polling are working hard to fix the problems exposed in 2016 and 2020, experimenting with more data sources and interview approaches than ever before. Still, polls are more useful to the public if people have realistic expectations about what surveys can do well \u2013 and what they cannot.\n\nWith that in mind, here are some key points to know about polling heading into this year\u2019s presidential election.\n\nTerminology Probability sampling (or \u201crandom sampling\u201d). This refers to a polling method in which survey participants are recruited using random sampling from a database or list that includes nearly everyone in the population. The pollster selects the sample. The survey is not open for anyone who wants to sign up. Online opt-in polling (or \u201cnonprobability sampling\u201d). These polls are recruited using a variety of methods that are sometimes referred to as \u201cconvenience sampling.\u201d Respondents come from a variety of online sources such as ads on social media or search engines, websites offering rewards in exchange for survey participation, or self-enrollment. Unlike surveys with probability samples, people can volunteer to participate in opt-in surveys. Nonresponse and nonresponse bias. Nonresponse is when someone sampled for a survey does not participate. Nonresponse bias occurs when the pattern of nonresponse leads to error in a poll estimate. For example, college graduates are more likely than those without a degree to participate in surveys, leading to the potential that the share of college graduates in the resulting sample will be too high. Mode of interview. This refers to the format in which respondents are presented with and respond to survey questions. The most common modes are online, live telephone, text message and paper. Some polls use more than one mode. Weighting. This is a statistical procedure pollsters perform to make their survey align with the broader population on key characteristics like age, race, etc. For example, if a survey has too many college graduates compared with their share in the population, people without a college degree are \u201cweighted up\u201d to match the proper share.\n\nHow are election polls being conducted?\n\nPollsters are making changes in response to the problems in previous elections. As a result, polling is different today than in 2016. Most U.S. polling organizations that conducted and publicly released national surveys in both 2016 and 2022 (61%) used methods in 2022 that differed from what they used in 2016. And change has continued since 2022.\n\nOne change is that the number of active polling organizations has grown significantly, indicating that there are fewer barriers to entry into the polling field. The number of organizations that conduct national election polls more than doubled between 2000 and 2022.\n\nThis growth has been driven largely by pollsters using inexpensive opt-in sampling methods. But previous Pew Research Center analyses have demonstrated how surveys that use nonprobability sampling may have errors twice as large, on average, as those that use probability sampling.\n\nThe second change is that many of the more prominent polling organizations that use probability sampling \u2013 including Pew Research Center \u2013 have shifted from conducting polls primarily by telephone to using online methods, or some combination of online, mail and telephone. The result is that polling methodologies are far more diverse now than in the past.\n\n(For more about how public opinion polling works, including a chapter on election polls, read our short online course on public opinion polling basics.)\n\nAll good polling relies on statistical adjustment called \u201cweighting,\u201d which makes sure that the survey sample aligns with the broader population on key characteristics. Historically, public opinion researchers have adjusted their data using a core set of demographic variables to correct imbalances between the survey sample and the population.\n\nBut there is a growing realization among survey researchers that weighting a poll on just a few variables like age, race and gender is insufficient for getting accurate results. Some groups of people \u2013 such as older adults and college graduates \u2013 are more likely to take surveys, which can lead to errors that are too sizable for a simple three- or four-variable adjustment to work well. Adjusting on more variables produces more accurate results, according to Center studies in 2016 and 2018.\n\nA number of pollsters have taken this lesson to heart. For example, recent high-quality polls by Gallup and The New York Times/Siena College adjusted on eight and 12 variables, respectively. Our own polls typically adjust on 12 variables. In a perfect world, it wouldn\u2019t be necessary to have that much intervention by the pollster. But the real world of survey research is not perfect.\n\nPre-election polls face one critical challenge that the routine opinion poll does not: determining which of the people surveyed will cast a ballot. (procurator via Getty Images)\n\nPredicting who will vote is critical \u2013 and difficult. Preelection polls face one crucial challenge that routine opinion polls do not: determining who of the people surveyed will actually cast a ballot.\n\nRoughly a third of eligible Americans do not vote in presidential elections, despite the enormous attention paid to these contests. Determining who will abstain is difficult because people can\u2019t perfectly predict their future behavior \u2013 and because many people feel social pressure to say they\u2019ll vote even if it\u2019s unlikely.\n\nNo one knows the profile of voters ahead of Election Day. We can\u2019t know for sure whether young people will turn out in greater numbers than usual, or whether key racial or ethnic groups will do so. This means pollsters are left to make educated guesses about turnout, often using a mix of historical data and current measures of voting enthusiasm. This is very different from routine opinion polls, which mostly do not ask about people\u2019s future intentions.\n\nWhen major news breaks, a poll\u2019s timing can matter. Public opinion on most issues is remarkably stable, so you don\u2019t necessarily need a recent poll about an issue to get a sense of what people think about it. But dramatic events can and do change public opinion, especially when people are first learning about a new topic. For example, polls this summer saw notable changes in voter attitudes following Joe Biden\u2019s withdrawal from the presidential race. Polls taken immediately after a major event may pick up a shift in public opinion, but those shifts are sometimes short-lived. Polls fielded weeks or months later are what allow us to see whether an event has had a long-term impact on the public\u2019s psyche.\n\nHow accurate are polls?\n\nThe answer to this question depends on what you want polls to do. Polls are used for all kinds of purposes in addition to showing who\u2019s ahead and who\u2019s behind in a campaign. Fair or not, however, the accuracy of election polling is usually judged by how closely the polls matched the outcome of the election.\n\nBy this standard, polling in 2016 and 2020 performed poorly. In both years, state polling was characterized by serious errors. National polling did reasonably well in 2016 but faltered in 2020.\n\nIn 2020, a post-election review of polling by the American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) found that \u201cthe 2020 polls featured polling error of an unusual magnitude: It was the highest in 40 years for the national popular vote and the highest in at least 20 years for state-level estimates of the vote in presidential, senatorial, and gubernatorial contests.\u201d\n\nHow big were the errors? Polls conducted in the last two weeks before the election suggested that Biden\u2019s margin over Trump was nearly twice as large as it ended up being in the final national vote tally.\n\nErrors of this size make it difficult to be confident about who is leading if the election is closely contested, as many U.S. elections are.\n\nPollsters are rightly working to improve the accuracy of their polls. But even an error of 4 or 5 percentage points isn\u2019t too concerning if the purpose of the poll is to describe whether the public has favorable or unfavorable opinions about candidates, or to show which issues matter to which voters. And on questions that gauge where people stand on issues, we usually want to know broadly where the public stands. We don\u2019t necessarily need to know the precise share of Americans who say, for example, that climate change is mostly caused by human activity. Even judged by its performance in recent elections, polling can still provide a faithful picture of public sentiment on the important issues of the day.\n\nThe 2022 midterms saw generally accurate polling, despite a wave of partisan polls predicting a broad Republican victory. In fact, FiveThirtyEight found that \u201cpolls were more accurate in 2022 than in any cycle since at least 1998, with almost no bias toward either party.\u201d Moreover, a handful of contrarian polls that predicted a 2022 \u201cred wave\u201d largely washed out when the votes were tallied. In sum, if we focus on polling in the most recent national election, there\u2019s plenty of reason to be encouraged.\n\nCompared with other elections in the past 20 years, polls have been less accurate when Donald Trump is on the ballot. Preelection surveys suffered from large errors \u2013 especially at the state level \u2013 in 2016 and 2020, when Trump was standing for election. But they performed reasonably well in the 2018 and 2022 midterms, when he was not.\n\nPew Research Center illustration\n\nDuring the 2016 campaign, observers speculated about the possibility that Trump supporters might be less willing to express their support to a pollster \u2013 a phenomenon sometimes described as the \u201cshy Trump effect.\u201d But a committee of polling experts evaluated five different tests of the \u201cshy Trump\u201d theory and turned up little to no evidence for each one. Later, Pew Research Center and, in a separate test, a researcher from Yale also found little to no evidence in support of the claim.\n\nInstead, two other explanations are more likely. One is about the difficulty of estimating who will turn out to vote. Research has found that Trump is popular among people who tend to sit out midterms but turn out for him in presidential election years. Since pollsters often use past turnout to predict who will vote, it can be difficult to anticipate when irregular voters will actually show up.\n\nThe other explanation is that Republicans in the Trump era have become a little less likely than Democrats to participate in polls. Pollsters call this \u201cpartisan nonresponse bias.\u201d Surprisingly, polls historically have not shown any particular pattern of favoring one side or the other. The errors that favored Democratic candidates in the past eight years may be a result of the growth of political polarization, along with declining trust among conservatives in news organizations and other institutions that conduct polls.\n\nWhatever the cause, the fact that Trump is again the nominee of the Republican Party means that pollsters must be especially careful to make sure all segments of the population are properly represented in surveys.\n\nThe real margin of error is often about double the one reported. A typical election poll sample of about 1,000 people has a margin of sampling error that\u2019s about plus or minus 3 percentage points. That number expresses the uncertainty that results from taking a sample of the population rather than interviewing everyone. Random samples are likely to differ a little from the population just by chance, in the same way that the quality of your hand in a card game varies from one deal to the next.\n\nThe problem is that sampling error is not the only kind of error that affects a poll. Those other kinds of error, in fact, can be as large or larger than sampling error. Consequently, the reported margin of error can lead people to think that polls are more accurate than they really are.\n\nThere are three other, equally important sources of error in polling: noncoverage error, where not all the target population has a chance of being sampled; nonresponse error, where certain groups of people may be less likely to participate; and measurement error, where people may not properly understand the questions or misreport their opinions. Not only does the margin of error fail to account for those other sources of potential error, putting a number only on sampling error implies to the public that other kinds of error do not exist.\n\nSeveral recent studies show that the average total error in a poll estimate may be closer to twice as large as that implied by a typical margin of sampling error. This hidden error underscores the fact that polls may not be precise enough to call the winner in a close election.\n\nOther important things to remember\n\nTransparency in how a poll was conducted is associated with better accuracy. The polling industry has several platforms and initiatives aimed at promoting transparency in survey methodology. These include AAPOR\u2019s transparency initiative and the Roper Center archive. Polling organizations that participate in these organizations have less error, on average, than those that don\u2019t participate, an analysis by FiveThirtyEight found.\n\nParticipation in these transparency efforts does not guarantee that a poll is rigorous, but it is undoubtedly a positive signal. Transparency in polling means disclosing essential information, including the poll\u2019s sponsor, the data collection firm, where and how participants were selected, modes of interview, field dates, sample size, question wording, and weighting procedures.\n\nThere is evidence that when the public is told that a candidate is extremely likely to win, some people may be less likely to vote. Following the 2016 election, many people wondered whether the pervasive forecasts that seemed to all but guarantee a Hillary Clinton victory \u2013 two modelers put her chances at 99% \u2013 led some would-be voters to conclude that the race was effectively over and that their vote would not make a difference. There is scientific research to back up that claim: A team of researchers found experimental evidence that when people have high confidence that one candidate will win, they are less likely to vote. This helps explain why some polling analysts say elections should be covered using traditional polling estimates and margins of error rather than speculative win probabilities (also known as \u201cprobabilistic forecasts\u201d).\n\nNational polls tell us what the entire public thinks about the presidential candidates, but the outcome of the election is determined state by state in the Electoral College. The 2000 and 2016 presidential elections demonstrated a difficult truth: The candidate with the largest share of support among all voters in the United States sometimes loses the election. In those two elections, the national popular vote winners (Al Gore and Hillary Clinton) lost the election in the Electoral College (to George W. Bush and Donald Trump). In recent years, analysts have shown that Republican candidates do somewhat better in the Electoral College than in the popular vote because every state gets three electoral votes regardless of population \u2013 and many less-populated states are rural and more Republican.\n\nFor some, this raises the question: What is the use of national polls if they don\u2019t tell us who is likely to win the presidency? In fact, national polls try to gauge the opinions of all Americans, regardless of whether they live in a battleground state like Pennsylvania, a reliably red state like Idaho or a reliably blue state like Rhode Island. In short, national polls tell us what the entire citizenry is thinking. Polls that focus only on the competitive states run the risk of giving too little attention to the needs and views of the vast majority of Americans who live in uncompetitive states \u2013 about 80%.\n\nFortunately, this is not how most pollsters view the world. As the noted political scientist Sidney Verba explained, \u201cSurveys produce just what democracy is supposed to produce \u2013 equal representation of all citizens.\u201d",

        "text": "Democrats Drive Surge in Election Enthusiasm\nClose to eight in 10 Democrats say they are more enthusiastic than usual about voting\n\nWASHINGTON, D.C. -- Americans\u2019 enthusiasm about voting in this year\u2019s election has surged in recent months, with 69% of U.S. adults now saying they are \u201cmore enthusiastic than usual\u201d about voting. This is up from 54% in March.\n\nThe Aug. 1-20 survey was conducted mostly before the Aug. 19-22 Democratic National Convention but after President Joe Biden abandoned his reelection bid on July 21. Party leaders quickly coalesced around Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee in the days after Biden's announcement.\n\nDemocrats and Democratic-leaning independents are largely driving the surge in enthusiasm nationally. In March, 55% of Democrats and Democratic leaners said they were more enthusiastic than usual about voting; now, 78% are. Republicans and Republican leaners, who held a slight edge in enthusiasm in March, now trail Democrats by a significant margin, with their current 64% enthusiasm score up slightly from 59% in the spring.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nAs a result of these changes, election enthusiasm has shifted from being at an average level in March to the highest Gallup has measured during a presidential election campaign. Gallup measured similarly high enthusiasm -- 67% -- in September 2020, October 2008 and August 2004 surveys.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nDemocrats\u2019 current level of enthusiasm is one percentage point shy of the group\u2019s high in Gallup\u2019s trend since 2000. That was the 79% measured in February 2008, when Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton were engaged in a spirited battle for the party\u2019s presidential nomination. Enthusiasm subsided later that year, but by the end of the campaign, consistently more than seven in 10 said they were more enthusiastic than usual about voting. Democratic enthusiasm was also elevated during the 2004 and 2020 presidential campaigns.\n\nRepublican enthusiasm about the 2024 election is approaching the record 70% measured in August 2020, when Donald Trump was seeking a second term as president. Republicans had similarly high levels of enthusiasm in the latter stages of the 2004 and 2012 elections.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nThought Given to the Election at Record High for August\n\nThe Aug. 1-20 poll also finds 79% of Americans saying they have given \u201cquite a lot\u201d of thought to the election, surpassing the previous August high of 74% in 2008.\n\nGiven that more Americans typically pay attention to the election closer to Election Day than do in August, 2024 is poised to establish a new high in election thought at the conclusion of the campaign. Currently, the 84% from 2004 is the highest Gallup has measured immediately before Election Day.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nAmericans have been closely tuned in to the election all year, with 77% in February and 71% in April saying they had given it considerable thought.\n\nEarly this year, Republicans were more likely than Democrats and independents to be thinking about the election, perhaps because of the Republican presidential primaries. Now, Democrats and Republicans show similar levels of attention, with independents still trailing by about 20 percentage points.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nMost Voters Have Made Up Their Minds\n\nWith voters highly engaged in the election campaign, it is not surprising that most have already made their choice about whom they will be voting for. Seventy-nine percent of U.S. adults, including 83% of those registered to vote, report they have made up their mind, leaving about one in five U.S. adults (19%) -- and one in six registered voters (16%) -- saying they are still deciding.\n\nDemocratic adults (93%) are slightly more likely than Republican adults (86%) to say they have made up their mind. About six in 10 political independents report having decided on a candidate, while 35% have not.\n\nAmericans Generally Positive About the Campaign Process\n\nAmericans mostly answer positively when asked about six different ways the campaign could reflect a healthy democracy. Specifically, 79% think the presidential campaign has identified at least one good candidate; 71% say it has fostered discussion of important issues; 81% believe they know where the candidates stand on those issues; and 72% say the candidates have offered solutions to the country's problems.\n\nIn contrast to these generally positive reviews, more Americans disagree than agree that the way the campaign is being conducted makes them think the process is working as it should.\n\nOn a more personal level, 88% of U.S. adults say it makes a real difference to them who is elected president.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nFor the campaign aspects that generate positive reviews, majorities of both Republicans and Democrats agree that the campaign is going well in these respects, in some cases because they are probably answering in terms of their preferred candidate. By contrast, their views of how the campaign is being conducted may tap more into perceptions of the opposing candidate.\n\nAt a time when the Trump campaign is calling foul on the Democrats\u2019 replacement of Biden as the Democratic nominee after the primaries had taken place, 70% of Democrats versus 26% of Republicans say the conduct of the campaign makes them feel the process is working this year. Independents\u2019 views are closer to those of Republicans than Democrats.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats hold similarly positive views on the other election dynamics rated, while independents tend to be less positive than the two major-party groups about the campaign.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nBottom Line\n\nBiden\u2019s decision to stand down as the Democratic nominee amid pressure from high-ranking Democrats preceded a surge in election enthusiasm among the party faithful while raising doubts among Republicans and independents about the process. Still, both party groups are highly engaged in the election, although Democrats' level of engagement now exceeds that of Republicans. As a result of elevated election thought and enthusiasm in both parties, voter participation could surpass what it was in 2020, when two-thirds of eligible U.S. adults cast ballots, the highest in over 100 years.\n\nTo stay up to date with the latest Gallup News insights and updates, follow us on X @Gallup.\n\nLearn more about how the Gallup Poll Social Series works.\n\nView complete question responses and trends (PDF download).\n\n###Embeddable###",

        "text": "The US presidential race will be fought over competing definitions of \u2018freedom\u2019\nThe recently concluded Democratic national convention marked a sharp turn in US political rhetoric. \u201cFreedom, where are you?\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 sang in the video that opened the gathering. Her song proved to be a fitting introduction to the days that followed. Joe Biden had made saving democracy from the threat of Maga authoritarianism the centerpiece of his ill-fated campaign for re-election. The keynote of Kamala Harris\u2019s convention, invoked by nearly every speaker, was \u201cfreedom\u201d.\n\nNearly a century ago, in the wake of the Great Depression, Franklin Delano Roosevelt linked freedom to economic security for ordinary Americans \u2013 \u201cfreedom from want\u201d was one of the four freedoms summarizing the country\u2019s aims in the second world war. This definition of freedom, a product of the New Deal, assumed an active role for the federal government. But since the 1980s, when Ronald Reagan in effect redefined freedom as limited government, low taxes and unregulated economic enterprise, Democrats have pretty much ceded the word to their opponents. Now they want it back.\n\nOf course freedom \u2013 along with liberty, generally used as an equivalent \u2013 has been a US preoccupation ever since the American revolution gave birth to a nation that identified itself, in Thomas Jefferson\u2019s words, as an \u201cempire of liberty\u201d, a unique embodiment of freedom in a world overrun by oppression. The declaration of independence includes liberty among mankind\u2019s unalienable rights; the constitution announces at the outset its aim of securing the \u201cblessings of liberty\u201d. As a result, freedom has long been a powerful rhetorical weapon. As the educator and statesman Ralph Bunche wrote in 1940: \u201cEvery man in the street, white, black, red or yellow, knows that this is \u2018The land of the free\u2019 \u2026 [and] the \u2018cradle of liberty\u2019.\u201d\n\nYet freedom is neither a fixed idea nor an evolutionary progress toward a predetermined goal. The history of US freedom is a tale of debates and struggles. Often, battles for control of the idea illustrate the contrast between \u201cnegative\u201d and \u201cpositive\u201d meanings of freedom, a dichotomy elaborated by Sir Isaiah Berlin in an influential essay in 1958. Negative liberty defines freedom as the absence of outside restraints on individual action. Positive liberty is a form of empowerment \u2013 the ability to set and fulfill one\u2019s goals. As the contrast between FDR and Reagan illustrates, the first sees government as a threat to freedom and the second as removing barriers to its enjoyment, often by government intervention.\n\nThe Democratic convention built upon this history. Positive and negative freedom co-existed and reinforced one another. The frequent calls for \u201creproductive freedom\u201d \u2013 the right to make intimate decisions free of governmental interference (or as vice-presidential nominee Tim Walz put it, the principle of \u201cmind your own damn business\u201d) \u2013 embraced and expanded the idea of negative freedom. Never before has the 60s slogan \u201cthe personal is political\u201d found such powerful expression at a party convention.\n\nPositive freedom also made its appearance, notably in Bernie Sanders\u2019 litany of future government action against the likes of big oil and big pharma in the name of combating economic inequality and \u201ccorporate greed\u201d. Walz, echoing FDR, commented that people who lack access to affordable housing and healthcare are not truly free.\n\nThere is another crucial element to the ongoing debate about freedom: who is entitled to enjoy it. When the constitution was ratified, the United States was home to half a million enslaved African Americans. The first laws defining how immigrants could become citizens, enacted in the 1790s, limited the process to \u201cwhite\u201d persons. It took more than half a century for slavery to be eradicated and for Black persons, for a brief period during the era of Reconstruction that followed the civil war, to be incorporated into the body politic.\n\nThis history exemplifies what the historian Tyler Stovall, in a recent book, calls \u201cWhite Freedom\u201d. Fast forward to the civil rights revolution of the 1960s. With its freedom rides, freedom songs and insistent cry \u201cfreedom now\u201d, that revolution linked freedom with equality regardless of race or national origin. What is now remembered simply as \u201cthe movement\u201d did more to redefine the meaning of freedom than any other development of the last century. Its fruits were visible every night in the Democratic convention\u2019s remarkably diverse composition.\n\nThroughout our history, freedom has been defined, in large measure, by its limits. This is how the Confederacy was able to claim to be fighting for liberty. The historian Jefferson Cowie, whose book Freedom\u2019s Dominion won the Pulitzer prize for history in 2023, argues that negative freedom, expressed as opposition to federal intervention in local affairs, has often boiled down to little more than the determination of local elites to exercise political and economic power over subordinate groups without outside interference. Civil rights were condemned as a threat to white people\u2019s liberty (the freedom, for example, to choose who is allowed to live in one\u2019s neighborhood). The vaunted independence of men depended on limiting the freedom of women.\n\nWith the party conventions over, the campaign now becomes, in part, a contest to define the meaning of freedom. Historical precedents exist for such a battle. In 1936, the New York Times observed that the fight for possession of \u201cthe ideal of freedom\u201d was the central issue of that year\u2019s presidential campaign. Three decades later, the journalist Theodore White noted that freedom was the \u201cdominant word\u201d of both civil rights demonstrators and supporters of the conservative Republican candidate Barry Goldwater, but they meant entirely different things by it. The United States, he concluded, sorely needed \u201ca commonly-agreed-on concept of freedom\u201d.\n\nFreedom is often used to mobilize support in wartime. No recent president employed it for this purpose more egregiously than George W Bush, who made freedom an all-purpose justification for the invasion of Iraq. In his first inaugural address, Bush used the words \u201cfreedom\u201d, \u201cfree\u201d or \u201cliberty\u201d seven times. In his second, a 10-minute speech delivered after the invasion, they appeared no fewer than 49 times.\n\nBush\u2019s egregious distortion of the ideal of freedom seemed to discourage his successors from using the word at all. Barack Obama preferred the language of community and personal responsibility. Nor has freedom been a major theme of Donald Trump, who prefers to speak of raw military and economic power. But Trump\u2019s long campaign to deny that Obama is a US citizen, and his calls for the immense deportation of undocumented immigrants, resonate with those who seek to redraw freedom\u2019s boundaries along racial and nativist lines.\n\nThe Democratic convention appears to have guaranteed that the 2024 election will be a contest over the meaning of freedom. Whatever the result, it will likely define American freedom for years to come.",

        "text": "August 29, 2024, presidential campaign news\nVice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz are interviewed by CNN\u2019s Dana Bash at Kim\u2019s Cafe in Savannah, Georgia, on August 29 Will Lanzoni/CNN\n\nHere are some takeaways from the Democratic ticket\u2019s interview with CNN\u2019s Dana Bash:\n\nFlip-flop on fracking: In 2019, Kamala Harris opposed fracking \u2014 a position that could have proven politically damaging in Pennsylvania, where it\u2019s a huge employer. Now, she says, she supports it.\n\nProgressives have opposed fracking due to concerns about climate change. But under the Inflation Reduction Act, a bill that Harris cast the tie-breaking vote to pass in the Senate and President Joe Biden signed into law in 2022, fracking has expanded.\n\nHarris said she had already changed her position on fracking in 2020, when she said that Biden \u201cwill not end fracking.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I have seen is that we can grow and we can increase a thriving clean energy economy without banning fracking,\u201d she told Bash.\n\nAppointing a Republican to the Cabinet: Asked if she would appoint a Republican to her Cabinet, Harris said: \u201cYes, I would.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one in particular,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have 68 days to go in this election, so I\u2019m not putting the cart before the horse. But I would.\u201d\n\nRefusing to engage in identity politics: Last month, Donald Trump questioned Harris\u2019 racial identity, suggesting she\u2019d previously identified as South Asian but \u201chappened to turn Black\u201d for political purposes.\n\nShaking her head, Harris said Trump\u2019s remark is part of his \u201csame old tired playbook.\u201d\n\n\u201cNext question, please,\u201d she said.\n\nHer refusal to comment further aligns with her campaign\u2019s strategy to avoid leaning into identity politics following Trump\u2019s remarks. It could also indicate how Harris might handle challenges to her race and gender during her first debate with Trump next month.\n\nBiden\u2019s call: Harris said she was having breakfast with her family on July 21 when the phone rang.\n\n\u201cIt was Joe Biden, and he told me what he had decided to do,\u201d Harris said, in her most extensive remarks yet on how she learned the president was ending his reelection bid and endorsing her to replace him at the top of the Democratic ticket.\n\n\u201cI asked him, \u2018Are you sure?\u2019 and he said: \u2018Yes,\u2019\u201d Harris recalled. \u201cMy first thought was not about me, to be honest with you. My first thought was about him.\u201d\n\nBlaming Trump on border security: Trump has made attacking the Biden administration\u2019s handling of the US-Mexico border a signature issue, but Harris said Trump bears much of the blame for the border security problems he bemoans.\n\nShe pointed to his opposition to the bipartisan border security bill hashed out by a group of lawmakers. Asked if she would push that bill if she is elected president, Harris said: \u201cI would make sure that it would come to my desk and I would sign it.\u201d\n\nShe also said she does not support decriminalizing illegally crossing the border into the United States, reversing another position she took in 2019.\n\nWalz says he owns his mistakes: Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Harris\u2019 running mate, was pressed on false claims he\u2019s made, including in a 2018 video in which he refers to \u201cweapons of war, that I carried in war.\u201d\n\nThough Walz served 24 years in the Army National Guard, he was never in a combat zone. He said he misspoke.\n\n\u201cMy wife, the English teacher, told me my grammar\u2019s not always correct,\u201d he said.\n\nWalz had also said in his convention speech that he and his wife used IVF to conceive their children but has since clarified it was a different kind of fertility treatment.\n\n\u201cI certainly own my mistakes when I make them,\u201d he said.\n\nRead the full story.",

        "text": "US election process explained: This is how the next president will be elected\nAs the countdown to the United States general election begins, the nation is immersed in a whirlwind of political debates, campaign rallies, fundraisers, endorsements, and relentless social media chatter, all aimed at determining the next occupant of the White House. US election process explained as Republican presidential candidate former President Donald to take on Democrat presidential candidate Kamala Harris in one of the tightest contests ever.(AP)\n\nWhile former President Donald Trump is confident about reclaiming the White House throne, Vice President Kamala Harris is proving to be a formidable obstacle, making the race more intense than ever. As the political noise reaches a crescendo, here\u2019s a breakdown of how the United States will elect its next president.\n\nThe Road to the White House: The timeline\n\nThe U.S. presidential election process is a complex journey divided into several key phases: primaries and caucuses, national conventions, the general election campaign, and the Electoral College vote.\n\n1. Understanding Primaries and Caucuses: January to June\n\nThe journey to the White House began in early 2023, with various candidates announcing their intentions to run for president. Joe Biden emerged as the most prominent Democratic contender, while Donald Trump faced a crowded Republican field, including Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, and Indian-American entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy.\n\nThe primaries and caucuses, were then held in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories. These events were essential in determining the presidential nominees for the two major political parties: the Democrats and the Republicans.\n\nTrump, who had maintained a strong lead in the polls since 2020, confidently skipped all GOP debates, believing his nomination was secure. Nikki Haley gained some momentum in late 2023, but none of Trump\u2019s challengers could match his polling numbers, leading most to eventually withdraw from the race.\n\nDuring primary elections, registered voters cast ballots for their preferred candidate, while states like Iowa used caucuses, which involve local meetings where party members vote on their preferred candidates.\n\nThe results of these primaries and caucuses determined how many delegates each candidate would have at their party\u2019s national convention. Delegates are representatives who pledge to support a specific candidate at the convention.\n\n2. National Conventions: July to August\n\nAfter the primaries and caucuses, the Democratic and Republican parties hold their national conventions, usually in the summer before the general election. These conventions are major political events, featuring speeches, rallies, and the official nomination of each party\u2019s candidate for president and vice president.\n\nThis year months before the national convention Joe Biden and Donald Trump enjoyed full support and majority to be the candidates, however Biden had to end his race amidst widespread concerns over his age and mental ability to contest. Soon after his disastrous performance during presidential debate against Donald Trump Biden decided to step aside and handover the baton to Kamala Harris.\n\nWithin weeks before the national convention Kamala surged unopposed to become the parties presidential candidate with endorsements from Obama, Nancy Pelosi, Clintons and majority Democrat members.\n\nBefore the conventions the presidential candidates announced their running mates, Kamala Haris picked Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Donald Trump opted for senator JD Vance.\n\nAt the conventions, delegates formally casted their votes for their candidate who then secured a majority of delegates becomes the party\u2019s nominee. Traditionally the outcome of the conventions has been largely a formality, as the presumptive nominees typically secure enough delegates during the primaries.\n\n3. The General Election Campaign: September to October\n\nOnce the nominees are confirmed, the general election campaign kicks into high gear. This phase involves intense campaigning across the country, with candidates making their case to the American people through rallies, debates, advertisements, and social media. The general election campaign is characterized by several key elements:\n\nPresidential debates, often held between September and October, are crucial moments in the campaign. This year Trump and Kamala have agreed for presidential debate on ABC News on 10 September. Whereas vice presidential candidates Vance and Walz will debate on CBS News on October 1.\n\nCampaigns invest in extensive voter outreach efforts, including grassroots organizing, phone banking, and get-out-the-vote drives, to mobilize their supporters.\n\n4. US Election Day: November 5, 2024\n\nElection Day, held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November, is when voters across the country cast their ballots for the presidential candidates. This year it falls on November 5, 2024. However, unlike in many other democracies, the U.S. president is not elected directly by the popular vote. Instead, the Electoral College plays a decisive role.\n\nUnderstanding The Electoral College: A Unique System\n\nThe U.S. Electoral College is a unique and sometimes controversial aspect of the American election process. Each state is allocated a certain number of electors based on its representation in Congress\u2014this includes the number of Senators (always two) and the number of Representatives (which varies by state population). There are 538 electors in total, and a candidate needs a majority of 270 electoral votes to win the presidency.\n\n5. Electoral Vote: Counting in December, 2024\n\nAfter Election Day, electors meet in their respective states in December to cast their electoral votes. These votes are then sent to Congress, where they are counted in early January. The candidate who receives a majority of the electoral votes is officially declared the next president of the United States.\n\nWhat Happens if No Candidate Wins a Majority?\n\nIn the rare event that no candidate wins a majority of the electoral votes, the election is decided by the House of Representatives. Each state delegation in the House gets one vote, and the candidate who receives a majority of the votes becomes president. The Senate selects the vice president in a similar process.\n\n6. Presidential Inauguration Day: January 20\n\nThe final step in the election process is the inauguration, held on January 20th of the year following the election. On this day, the president-elect takes the Oath of Office, administered by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, and officially begins their four-year term.",

        "text": "Exclusive: Kamala Harris surges ahead of Donald Trump in latest poll taken after DNC\nAI-assisted summary Kamala Harris has surged ahead of Donald Trump, 48%-43%, in a new USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll.\n\nThe findings reflect an eight-point turnaround in the presidential race from late June.\n\nDemocrat Kamala Harris has surged ahead of Republican Donald Trump, 48%-43%, a new USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll found.\n\nThe findings reflect an eight-point turnaround in the presidential race from late June, when Trump had led President Joe Biden in the survey by nearly four points.\n\nThe vice president's small lead was fueled by big shifts among some key demographic groups traditionally crucial for Democrats, including Hispanic and Black voters and young people. Among those with annual incomes of less than $20,000, in the biggest change, a three-point Trump edge over Biden in June has become a 23-point Harris advantage over Trump in August.\n\nShe has succeeded in doing what Biden never could this year: lead Trump. Her advantage is within the survey's margin of error, and the poll was taken after the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, which rallied party spirits.\n\nAt least for the moment, though, the findings reflect momentum in Harris' direction as the sprint to the general election is poised to begin.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nThe poll of 1,000 likely voters, taken by landline and cellphone Sunday through Wednesday, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points. With the election approaching, the survey is now measuring likely voters; previous polls were of registered voters.\n\nWithout the customary rounding of results, her edge would be closer to four points than five, 47.6%-43.3%.\n\nMore:Georgia is on Harris' mind: VP looks to win over voters in first post-convention stop\n\nThe success of 'Brat Summer' and targeted appeals\n\nThe findings underscore the success of the targeted appeals at the Democratic convention last week.\n\n\"With the 'Brat Summer' of Kamala Harris emojis winding down, young people, persons of color, and low-income households have swung dramatically toward the vice president,\" said David Paleologos, director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center. \"These same demographics were emphasized and woven together by numerous speakers at the convention.\"\n\nAmong the biggest shifts since June, all outside the poll's margin of error:\n\nVoters 18 to 34 years old moved from supporting Trump by 11 points to supporting Harris by 13 points, 49%-36%.\n\nHispanics, a group the Republican campaign has been cultivating, moved from supporting Trump by two points to supporting Harris by 16 points, 53%-37%.\n\nBlack voters, traditionally one of the most overwhelmingly Democratic groups, moved from supporting Biden by 47 points to supporting Harris by 64 points, 76%-12%.\n\nLower-income voters now support Harris 58%-35%. She has emphasized her commitment to creating an \"opportunity economy\" that makes housing more affordable and tackles price-gouging on food, although she hasn't released detailed policy plans.\n\nKeeping up with Washington? Sign up for USA TODAY's On Politics newsletter.\n\nMore:'Furious': Veterans slam Trump team's altercation at Arlington National Cemetery\n\n'I'm very excited to vote for a woman'\n\nVoters of all stripes say the election has been transformed. Harris is the first woman of color and the first person of South Asian descent to be nominated for president by a major party. At 59, she is a generation younger than Trump, the former president, who is 78, and Biden, who is 81.\n\n\"I think people are cautiously optimistic that they're going to have a lot better chance with Harris than they would have had with Biden going head-to-head with Trump,\" said Amy Hendrix, 46, of Fort Worth, Texas. An independent who usually votes Democratic, she was among those called in the poll. \"I'm very excited to vote for a woman, and that's just the truth.\"\n\nBut Jason Streem, also 46, a dentist from the Cleveland suburbs who supports Trump, objected to the way Harris became the nominee.\n\n\"She was never part of the running process,\" he said in a follow-up interview. \"She never received the primary votes.\" He called it \"the most undemocratic way of picking a nominee.\"\n\nBiden stepped back from his reelection race a little more than a month ago, under pressure by party leaders and donors who feared he could not win. That opened the door for an unprecedented quick switch to Harris for the nomination.\n\nIn the USA TODAY/Suffolk poll, Biden's vote share this year never topped 37.5%, and he trailed Trump from as little as half a percentage point last spring \u2212 basically, a tie \u2212 to nearly four points immediately after the Biden-Trump debate in early summer.\n\nThis was the first survey since independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. dropped out of the race and endorsed Trump. Independent Cornel West is now at 2%. Green Party nominee Jill Stein and Libertarian Chase Oliver are at 1% each.\n\nWhen voters supporting third-party candidates were asked for their second choice, 32% said Harris, 24% West and 15% Trump.",

        "text": "Harris-Trump debate rules include muted mics and no audience\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Next month\u2019s debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump won\u2019t have an audience, live microphones when candidates aren\u2019t speaking, or written notes, according to rules that ABC News, the host network, shared this week with both campaigns.\n\nA copy of the rules was provided to the Associated Press on Thursday by a senior Trump campaign official on condition of anonymity ahead of the network\u2019s announcement. The Harris campaign on Thursday insisted it was still discussing the muting of mics with ABC.\n\nThe parameters now in place for the Sept. 10 debate are essentially the same as they were for the June debate between Trump and President Joe Biden, a disastrous performance for the incumbent Democrat that fueled his exit from the campaign. It is the only debate that\u2019s been firmly scheduled and could be the only time voters see Harris and Trump go head to head before the November general election.\n\nThe back-and-forth over the debate rules reached a fever pitch this week, particularly on the issue of whether the microphones would be muted between turns speaking.\n\nREAD MORE: Harris and Trump squabble over upcoming debate, raising questions about whether face-off will take place\n\nHarris\u2019 campaign had advocated for live microphones for the whole debate, saying in a statement that the practice would \u201cfully allow for substantive exchanges between the candidates.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign had made microphone muting condition of his decision to accept any debates this year, a decision some aides now regret, saying voters were shielded from hearing Trump\u2019s outbursts during the debate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s interesting that Trump\u2019s handlers keep insisting on muting him, despite the candidate himself saying the opposite,\u201d Harris spokesman Ian Sams said. \u201cWhy won\u2019t they just do what the candidate wants?\u201d\n\nRepresentatives for Trump \u2014 who initially scoffed at the substitution of Harris into a debate arrangement he initially made with Biden in the race \u2014 had claimed that Harris sought \u201ca seated debate, with notes, and opening statements,\u201d specifications her campaign denied.\n\nAccording to ABC News, the candidates will stand behind lecterns, will not make opening statements and will not be allowed to bring notes during the 90-minute debate. David Muir and Linsey Davis will moderate the event at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia.\n\nAP White House Correspondent Zeke Miller in Savannah, Georgia, contributed to this report.

        "text": "U.S. economic growth revised up to solid 3 percent annual rate for second quarter of 2024\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The U.S. economy grew last quarter at a healthy 3 percent annual pace, fueled by strong consumer spending and business investment, the government said Thursday in an upgrade of its initial assessment.\n\nThe Commerce Department had previously estimated that the nation\u2019s gross domestic product \u2014 the total output of goods and services \u2014 expanded at a 2.8 percent rate from April through June.\n\nThe second-quarter growth marked a sharp acceleration from a sluggish 1.4 percent growth rate in the first three months of 2024.\n\nConsumer spending, which accounts for about 70 percent of U.S. economic activity, rose at a 2.9 percent annual rate last quarter. That was up from 2.3 percent in the government\u2019s initial estimate. Business investment expanded at a 7.5 percent rate, led by a 10.8 percent jump in investment in equipment.\n\nThursday\u2019s report reflected an economy that remains resilient despite the pressure of continued high interest rates. The state of the economy is weighing heavily on voters ahead of the November presidential election. Many Americans remain exasperated by high prices even though inflation has plummeted since peaking at a four-decade high in mid-2022.\n\nREAD MORE: \u2018The time has come\u2019 for the Federal Reserve to soon begin reducing interest rates, Powell says\n\nBut measures of consumers\u2019 spirits by the Conference Board and the University of Michigan have shown a recent uptick in confidence in the economy.\n\n\u201cThe GDP revisions show the U.S. economy was in good shape in mid-2024,\u2019\u2019 said Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank. \u201cSolid growth of consumer spending propelled the economy forward in the second quarter, and the increase of consumer confidence in July suggests it will propel growth in the second half of the year as well.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe latest GDP estimate for the April-June quarter included figures that showed that inflation continues to ease while remaining just above the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2 percent target. The central bank\u2019s favored inflation gauge \u2014 the personal consumption expenditures index, or PCE \u2014 rose at a 2.5 percent annual rate last quarter, down from 3.4 percent in the first quarter of the year. And excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core PCE inflation grew at a 2.7 percent pace, down from 3.2 percent from January through March.\n\nBoth the PCE inflation numbers issued Thursday marked a slight improvement on the government\u2019s first estimate.\n\nA GDP category that measures the economy\u2019s underlying strength rose at a healthy 2.9 percent annual rate, up from 2.6 percent in the first quarter. This category includes consumer spending and private investment but excludes volatile items such as exports, inventories and government spending.\n\nTo fight spiking prices, the Fed raised its benchmark interest rate 11 times in 2022 and 2023, lifting it to a 23-year high and helping shrink annual inflation from a peak of 9.1 percent to 2.9 percent as of last month. The much higher borrowing costs for consumers and businesses that resulted had been widely expected to cause a recession. Yet the economy has kept growing and employers have kept hiring.\n\nNow, with inflation hovering only slightly above the Fed\u2019s 2 percent target level and likely slowing further, Chair Jerome Powell has essentially declared victory over inflation. As a result, the Fed is poised to start cutting its benchmark interest rate when it next meets in mid-September.\n\nA sustained period of lower Fed rates would be intended to achieve a \u201csoft landing,\u201d whereby the central bank manages to curb inflation, maintain a healthy job market and avoid triggering a recession. Lower rates for auto loans, mortgages and other forms of consumer borrowing would likely follow.\n\nThe central bank has recently become more concerned about supporting the job market, which has been gradually weakening, than about continuing to fight inflation. The unemployment rate has risen for four straight months, to 4.3 percent, still low by historical standards. Job openings and the pace of hiring have also dropped, though they remain at relatively solid levels.\n\nThursday\u2019s report was the Commerce Department\u2019s second estimate of GDP growth in the April-June quarter. It will issue its final estimate late next month.",

        "text": "The 5 Closest Presidential Elections in US History\nEvery four years, tens of millions of Americans head to the polls to register their choice for president. Thanks to the nature of the electoral college, not all of those votes are created equal. It\u2019s possible for a candidate to receive more popular votes than their opponent, but still lose the election (it\u2019s happened five times).\n\nAmerica 101: What is the Electoral College?\n\nSo if you\u2019re starting to question if your vote really counts, consider that sometimes a presidential election can be decided by just a few thousand votes\u2014actual votes, not electoral ones\u2014or even a few hundred.\n\nHere are five American presidential elections with the narrowest margins of victory, ranked from largest to smallest.\n\n1. 1824: A Four-Way Electoral Split\n\nGetty Images John Quincy Adams and Andrew Jackson.\n\nThe historic 1824 presidential election saw four candidates\u2014all from the same political party\u2014running for the nation\u2019s highest office. The Federalists imploded after the death of Alexander Hamilton, leaving the Democratic-Republicans with an easy path to the presidency. The challenge was choosing a candidate.\n\nThis was an era before national conventions or any organized way of nominating a presidential candidate. As a result, regional factions of Democratic-Republicans threw their support behind four different men, each with high hopes of becoming president: John Quincy Adams, Henry Clay, Andrew Jackson and William H. Crawford.\n\nWhen the ballots from all 24 states were tallied, Andrew Jackson received the most electoral votes (99), followed by Adams (84), Crawford (41) and Clay (37). While Crawford and Clay finished a distant third and fourth, the fragmentation of the Democratic-Republicans prevented any single candidate from winning a majority of the electoral college.\n\n\u201cThe 1824 election is close, in a sense, because it\u2019s a very fractured result,\u201d says Edward Foley, an election law expert at The Ohio State University.\n\nThe Constitution says that if no candidate receives a majority of electoral college votes (in 1824, the magic number was 131), then the vote goes to the House of Representatives. According to the 12th Amendment, only the top three electoral vote-getters move on to the House, so Clay was out of the race.\n\nWhat followed were months of lobbying and horse trading as each state decided which candidate to support. A decisive moment came when Clay, who was serving as Speaker of the House, went against the wishes of his home state of Kentucky and backed Adams instead of Jackson. Adams ended up winning the House vote and therefore the presidency.\n\nJackson was furious when Adams turned around and chose Clay as his Secretary of State. Jackson called Clay a \u201cJudas\u201d and accused Adams and Clay of engaging in a \u201ccorrupt bargain\u201d to steal the election from Jackson.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s correct to say that the election was stolen or corrupt in any conventional sense of the term,\u201d says Foley, author of Ballot Battles: The History of Disputed Elections in the United States. \u201cGiven the lack of a majority, different factions are entitled to negotiate a coalition, like they do in parliamentary governments. The Clay faction united with the Adams faction against the Jackson faction.\u201d\n\nJackson got the last laugh when he trounced Adams in a presidential rematch in 1828.\n\n2. 1916 Election Came Down to California\n\nLibrary of Congress Charles Evans Hughes, Governor of New York, in 1908.\n\nToday, California carries a whopping 54 electoral votes, more than any other state. But back in 1916, the state\u2019s geographically scattered population hovered around 3 million people, giving California just 13 electoral votes.\n\nAs it turned out, California\u2019s 13 electoral votes were enough to swing the 1916 presidential election, and the difference between the state\u2019s electoral winner and loser was a mere 3,420 votes.\n\nThe presidential race in 1916 was between Woodrow Wilson, the Democratic incumbent, and Republican Charles Evans Hughes. Hughes is not a household name today, but he was a popular politician from New York and a Supreme Court justice. In fact, Hughes was the first Supreme Court justice to step down from the bench in order to run for president.\n\nThe Republicans picked Hughes in an attempt to heal their fractured party. In the previous election of 1912, former President Teddy Roosevelt split from the Republicans to run a third-party campaign as the progressive \u201cBull Moose\u201d candidate. Roosevelt won the most electoral votes (88) of any third-party candidate in history, but essentially handed the victory to Wilson by splitting the Republican vote.\n\nIn 1916, Hughes\u2019s job was to appeal to both the progressive and conservative factions of the Republican party, and he had his work cut out for him in California. That year, two California Republicans were vying for a seat in the Senate: progressive Hiram Johnson and conservative William Booth. The Hughes campaign needed to appeal to California Republicans backing both men in order to carry the state.\n\nJust months before the election, Hughes made an unpardonable error. While on a campaign visit to Long Beach, California, Hughes stayed at the same hotel as Johnson, but didn\u2019t invite the California politician for a drink or even a chat. Hughes swore that he had no idea Johnson was at the hotel, but Johnson insisted he was snubbed. Fuming at the insult, Johnson refused to campaign for Hughes in California.\n\nWithout Johnson\u2019s support, the presidential race in California between Hughes and Wilson was incredibly tight. When the votes were finally tallied, Wilson received 465,936 votes and Hughes got 462,516, a difference of 3,420 votes or 0.34 percent of all votes cast in California.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s 13 electoral votes gave the 1916 election to Wilson, who won 277 to 254.\n\nWith such a small margin of victory in California, the Hughes campaign hired lawyers to dig up evidence to argue for a recount.\n\n\u201cBut ultimately, Hughes and the Republicans said, \u2018We can\u2019t find anything,\u2019\u201d says Foley. \u201cThree thousand votes in California made the difference.\u201d\n\nIf Hughes had met Johnson for a drink, he might have been the U.S. president during World War I.\n\n3. 1884: Decided by 1,047 Votes\n\nLibrary of Congress James G. Blaine from Maine (left) and Grover Cleveland from New York faced off in 1884.\n\nThe 1884 election was somehow even closer than 1916. In this earlier election, the swing state in play was New York, the most populous state in the Union carrying 36 electoral votes.\n\nGrover Cleveland, the Democratic candidate, should have had an easy path to office. Cleveland was governor of New York and rose to prominence for his anti-corruption crusades against Tammany Hall. The Democrats had a vice grip on the Southern states, so all Cleveland needed to do to win the election was to take his home state of New York. The Republican candidate, James G. Blaine from Maine, didn\u2019t look like he had a chance.\n\nThen came the scandal. Cleveland, whose supporters praised him for his moral rectitude, was accused of fathering a child out of wedlock and abandoning the mother. Republican-leaning newspapers ran a mocking cartoon of a young boy crying, \u201cMa, Ma, Where\u2019s my Pa?\u201d\n\nLibrary of Congress A September 1884 cartoon mocking Grover Cleveland who was accused of fathering a child out of wedlock and abandoning the mother.\n\nCleveland didn\u2019t deny the accusation, and his campaign tried to refocus the race on political issues, not personal foibles. But Cleveland\u2019s reputation and popularity took a hit.\n\nAs a result, the presidential race in New York went from a \u201csure thing\u201d for Cleveland to an absolute barn burner. In the end, Cleveland received 563,048 votes in New York to Blaine\u2019s 562,001. That\u2019s a razor-thin margin of victory of 1,047 votes or 0.09 percent of all votes cast in the state.\n\nWith New York\u2019s 36 electoral votes, Cleveland narrowly defeated Blaine 219 to 182.\n\nEven though it\u2019s one of the closest elections in U.S. history, the 1884 race doesn\u2019t always make the list of hotly contested elections. Foley thinks that\u2019s because Blaine and the Republicans accepted the results without fighting them in court.\n\n\u201cThe 1884 election doesn't get a lot of attention, because it didn\u2019t spin out of control and get ugly,\u201d says Foley. \u201cIt\u2019s an example of a success story, really. Both sides lawyered up and really inspected the ballots closely, but the Republicans accepted defeat when it showed that they lost.\u201d\n\n4. 1876: Republicans Win by One Electoral Vote\n\nLibrary of Congress Samuel J. Tilden (left) and Rutherford B. Hayes (right).\n\nBy Foley\u2019s measure, the presidential election of 1876 was anything but a \u201csuccess story.\u201d Not only was it one of the closest presidential contests in American history, but it was also riddled with anti-democratic shenanigans including voter intimidation and ballot tampering.\n\nThe candidates in 1876 were Republican Rutherford B. Hayes and Democrat Samuel Tilden. But more important than the candidates themselves were the issues at stake. This election took place a decade after the Civil War. One of the goals of Reconstruction in the South was to safeguard voting rights for Black Americans as enshrined in the 15th Amendment, but those efforts met violent resistance from groups like the Redemption movement.\n\n\u201cThat movement engaged in what can only be called terrorism tactics against Black voting,\u201d says Foley.\n\nReconstruction was effectively dead by the 1876 election, and suppression of the Black vote was rampant, resulting in Democratic victories across the South. Hayes and the Republicans cried foul and demanded recounts in South Carolina, Louisiana and Florida. But instead of fighting fair, the Republicans resorted to their own dirty tricks.\n\n\u201cFlorida was the most egregious,\u201d says Foley. \u201cRepublicans there used their lingering power over the recount process to manipulate the counting of the ballots,\u201d says Foley. \u201cHad there been an honest recount in Florida, it would have favored the Democrats, but Hayes was declared the winner.\"\n\nThings got even messier from there. The Democratic attorney general of Florida came up with his own recount declaring Tilden the state\u2019s winner. Since the Constitution doesn\u2019t say what to do when electoral votes are contested, Congress had to come up with a solution. In this case it was a bipartisan group of 14 congressmen and one Supreme Court justice known as the Electoral Commission.\n\nUltimately, this 15-person commission decided the 1876 election, giving the presidency to Hayes and the Republicans by one vote.\n\nNote only did the commission\u2019s decision come down to one vote, but so did the tally in the electoral college. By winning all three of the contested states, Hayes defeated Tilden by 185 electoral votes to 184, the smallest electoral margin of victory in American history.\n\n5. 2000: Supreme Court Weighs In\n\nHow the U.S. Supreme Court Decided the Presidential Election of 2000\n\n\u201cThe 2000 election is the classic when it comes to close presidential elections,\u201d says Foley.\n\nThat contest, which dragged on for 36 days of intense legal wrangling, excruciating ballot recounts and a historic Supreme Court decision, was ultimately decided by just 537 votes.\n\nThe candidates in 2000 were Democrat Al Gore, the vice president, and Republican George W. Bush, governor of Texas and son of former president George H.W. Bush. The race was neck and neck, and once again Florida was the swing state. Whoever captured Florida\u2019s 25 electoral votes would win the presidency.\n\nExit polls on election night showed Bush with a commanding lead in Florida. After midnight, Bush\u2019s victory seemed so assured that Gore called the Texas governor to congratulate him. But just 45 minutes later, as Gore prepared to give his concession speech, aides told him that Bush\u2019s lead in Florida was shrinking fast. In an unprecedented move, Gore called Bush a second time to rescind his concession.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a term that recount lawyers use\u2014are the election results within the \u2018margin of litigation?\u2019\u201d says Foley. \u201cGore\u2019s lawyers determined that Bush\u2019s lead in Florida was definitely within the margin of litigation. It was worth fighting over.\u201d\n\nFirst the courts ordered an electronic recount, but Gore\u2019s team asked for a hand recount of paper ballots in certain voting precincts. The slow, painstaking process introduced Americans to the term \u201changing chad,\u201d referring to a punch-style ballot where the hole isn\u2019t fully perforated.\n\nRobert King/Newsmakers/Getty Images Contested ballots from Florida are studied following the 2000 election.\n\nThe legal fight went all the way to the Supreme Court, which handed down two rulings: 1.) the Florida recount, as it was being handled, was unconstitutional, and 2.) it was too late for Gore\u2019s team to issue further challenges. In a 5-4 decision, the justices gave the victory to Bush.\n\n\u201cFour of the justices wanted to remand the case back to Florida to clean up the recount procedure,\u201d says Foley, \u201cBut the other five justices said the clock\u2019s run out\u2014it\u2019s over.\u201d\n\nAt last count, Bush received 2,912,790 votes in Florida and Gore got 2,912,253 votes. Out of the nearly 6 million votes cast in Florida, Bush won by a margin of 537 votes, or 0.009 percent of the total votes cast in Florida.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the narrowest margin of victory in terms of percentage,\u201d says Foley. \u201cI can't think of any other presidential election that ends like that.\u201d",

The minimum wage increase, to $15 an hour by Jan. 1, 2026, had even stronger backing, with 57% of those surveyed saying they support it.\n\nThe poll also found majorities supporting every Republican running statewide, who each held at least a 10-percentage point lead over Democratic opponents. Former President Donald Trump was selected by 54% of respondents, with 41% backing Vice President Kamala Harris. The poll gives Lt. Gov. Mike Kehoe a 51% to 41% advantage over House Minority Leader Crystal Quade in the governor\u2019s race.\n\nThe best-funded Democratic statewide candidate, Lucas Kunce, was 11 percentage points behind incumbent Republican U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley, with the poll showing Hawley with a 53% to 42% edge.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be very surprised if any Democrat won a statewide race this year,\u201d poll director Steven Rogers said. \u201cIt\u2019s not breaking news that Democrats struggle in statewide races in Missouri.\u201d\n\nThe poll surveyed 900 voters and has a 3.8% margin of error. It included 69 questions, seeking views on major issues facing the state in addition to tracking approval ratings for politicians and testing election contests.\n\nThe results showed:\n\nThe economy is the biggest concern for voters, listed as the No. 1 issue by 47%. The survey also showed 69% view the national economy as fair or poor and 71% give that rating to the state economy. Health care, at 18%, and education, 16%, are the second and third issues listed as top concerns.\n\nA plurality of voters, 42%, oppose four-day school weeks, but those aged 18 to 29 support it by a 44% to 35% margin. Voters 65 years old or older had the strongest opposition. A new law requiring a public vote to adopt a four-day week in districts in charter counties and cities larger than 30,000 people had overwhelming support at 77%, which was consistent across all demographic, income and partisan groups.\n\nLaws to require a background check for gun sales and banning minors from carrying guns on public property without adult supervision also had overwhelming support, 79% and 85% respectively. But voters oppose other measures to control firearms, including allowing local ordinances that are stronger than state law.\n\nPolling by SLU/YouGov began in 2020, making this the second presidential election year for the project. Its last poll before the 2020 election pointed correctly to the outcome, but Republican candidates generally did better than the poll indicated.\n\nGov. Mike Parson was shown with a 50% to 44% lead over Democratic State Auditor Nicole Galloway and ended up winning by a 57-41 margin. That poll showed then-President Donald Trump with a 52% to 43% advantage over Joe Biden, with the final result a Trump win, also by a 57-41 margin.\n\nDemocrats are banking heavily on voter support for ballot measures, especially the abortion rights proposal, to help overcome some of the other disadvantages they face. No Democrat has won a statewide race since 2018.\n\nHistorically, however, ballot measures have only a marginal impact on candidate races, said Rogers, an associate professor of political science at St. Louis University.\n\n\u201cA presidential election year is probably the least effective time to have something else to boost turnout,\u201d he said.\n\nBallot measures can drive turnout. Three of the most high-profile Missouri ballot measures this century \u2014 same-sex marriage in 2004, right to work in 2018 and Medicaid expansion in 2020 \u2014 were placed on the August primary ballot by governors worried about the impact of ballot-measure voters on November campaigns.\n\nIn 2004, the issue coincided with a titanic battle for the Democratic nomination for governor and 847,000 Democrats voted. In 2018, with no significant primary, 607,577 votes were tallied in the Democratic primary for U.S. Senate and in 2020, where there again was no hotly contested primary, 537,000 Democrats voted in the gubernatorial race.\n\nIn years with no high-profile ballot measures, Democrats since 2000 have averaged about 350,000 voters in statewide primaries for governor and U.S. Senate.\n\nRepublicans also showed an increase in primary voters in the years with ballot measures, but not by the same degree. In years without controversial ballot measures, the GOP has averaged about 530,000 voters in statewide contests for governor and U.S. Senate. The average for 2004, 2018 and 2020 was about 640,000 votes.\n\nThat data shows that ballot measures can impact low-turnout elections, Rogers said. Presidential election years traditionally have the highest turnout.\n\n\u201cThose voters may already be turning out, and so the difference that you\u2019re making is probably going to be marginal,\u201d Rogers said.\n\nThe poll found very few voters are undecided, so the target for Democrats will have to be voters who support the ballot measures but intend to vote for Republican candidates. The poll shows that about one-third of voters who said they will vote for Trump, Kehoe and Hawley will also support the abortion rights amendment and minimum wage propositions.\n\nDemocrats will have a tough time switching voters, Rogers said.\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t much evidence of what we would call reverse coattails for ballot measures,\u201d he said.\n\nThe only Democrat already airing television ads in advance of the November election is Kunce, who has spent $2.7 million through Tuesday, according to FCC records reviewed by The Independent. Hawley has spent $1.2 million on television ads in defense of the seat he won in 2018.\n\nHawley is in the best position he has been in any of the previous SLU/YouGov polls. His approval rating is 53%, which is 14 percentage points higher than his negative rating. That is the best overall number recorded, Rogers said.\n\nHe also had a 14-point net positive rating in July 2021 in the first SLU/YouGov poll after the Jan. 6 attempt to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nHawley\u2019s lowest net positive was two points in an August 2022 poll taken just after video of him running away from the Senate chamber during the Jan. 6 riot was included in hearings of the House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack. In that survey, Hawley had a 46% favorable rating and a 44% unfavorable rating.\n\nThe only Republican statewide candidate who equals Hawley\u2019s support is state Sen. Denny Hoskins of Warrensburg, shown with a 54-36 lead in the secretary of state race over state Rep. Barbara Phifer, the Democratic nominee.\n\nHoskins ran in the primary as a team with state Sen. Bill Eigel, who finished second in the primary for governor. Eigel\u2019s combative style found an enthusiastic audience in some areas and that is likely helping Hoskins, Rogers said.\n\nHawley also has a reputation for being combative and that may explain why he is doing so well, Rogers said.\n\n\u201cHawley is not Eigel, but he sometimes acts Eigel-like,\u201d he said.\n\nThe poll found support for the abortion rights initiative, which is slated to appear on the November ballot as Amendment 3, is increasing. It is eight percentage points higher than found in a February poll, Rogers said.\n\nAmendment 3 has a plurality or majority of voters in most demographic, income and education subgroups, with only Republicans, as a group, and voters in rural areas of northeast and southern Missouri showing more opposition than support.\n\nThe abortion measure would overturn a Missouri law that took effect in June 2022 after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that provided federal constitutional protection for abortion. Under current Missouri law, abortions are only allowed to save the life of the mother or when \u201ca delay will create a serious risk of substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function.\u201d\n\nExactly how many initiative proposals will be on the Nov. 5 ballot remains uncertain.\n\nThe abortion rights measure and the proposal to legalize sports wagering must survive court challenges, and backers of a proposal to allow a new casino near the Lake of the Ozarks are trying to overturn the decision that they fell short of the required signatures in one congressional district.\n\nNo hearing had been set as of Wednesday afternoon for the challenge to the abortion rights amendment. Attorneys will be in court Sept. 5 for arguments over the sports wagering proposal, which would be Amendment 2 on the ballot, and on Friday for the casino proposal.\n\nWith no legal challenge, the campaign committee for increasing the minimum wage, known as Missourians for Healthy Families and Fair Wages, has already begun reserving television ad time for the final three weeks of the campaign. Through Tuesday, the committee had spent $904,000, according to FCC records.\n\nThe minimum wage proposal, which also includes a requirement for businesses to provide paid time off to employees, is supported across all regional, demographic, income, and education subgroups. Only Republicans, as a group, showed more opposition than support. On another question, pollsters surveyed what voters thought the minimum wage should be in Missouri and the median was $15, the level targeted in the initiative.\n\nSupport for sports wagering, seen in 50% of those polled, was also widespread. Only one subgroup, voters in southeast Missouri, showed more opposition to sports wagering than support.\n\nEach of the initiative campaigns is poised to spend millions to hold and expand the support shown in the polls. Rogers said he\u2019s confident that effort will pay dividends.\n\n\u201cMy anticipation,\u201d he said, \u201cis that as the campaigns become more active, and based off our previous polling, that support will only go up.\u201d",

        "text": "State Board Determines It Is Too Late to Remove We The People Nominee for President from the Ballot\nRaleigh, N.C.\n\nNote: This press release was updated on Aug. 30, 2024, to include the fact that votes for Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will be counted and reported.\n\nThe State Board of Elections on Thursday rejected a request from the We The People Party to remove its nominee, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., from the general election ballot, because it would not be practical to reprint ballots that have already been printed and meet the state law deadline to start absentee voting.\n\nApproximately 2 million ballots statewide have already been printed with Kennedy\u2019s name on them, and the first ballots will be sent to absentee voters in eight days.\n\nThe We the People Party, which was recognized this summer as a N.C. political party and nominated Kennedy as its presidential candidate, sent a letter to the State Board on Wednesday seeking to have Kennedy\u2019s name taken off of N.C. ballots. Read letter (PDF).\n\nThe State Board scheduled an emergency meeting for Thursday to consider the request. A majority of the Board determined it was too late in the process to change course and prepare and print new ballots across the state.\n\nEstimates from the vendor that prints ballots for most N.C. counties were that the time it would take to prepare and print new ballots would leave most North Carolina counties without ballots until mid-September at the earliest and lead to significant additional costs.\n\nThere is no deadline in state law for when a party may withdraw its presidential nominee and have their name replaced or removed from the ballot. However, under state law, absentee ballots must go out by Sept. 6 to voters who have already requested them, including military and overseas voters who may need more time to return their ballots. And under a provision in the North Carolina Administrative Code, when a political party wishes to change its presidential nominee close to an election but before ballots go out, the State Board must determine whether it is practical to reprint ballots at that point.\n\nAs of Thursday morning, the State Board was aware that at least 1,730,000 ballots had already been printed. About 95 of the 100 counties have ballots approved for printing, and at least some ballots have been printed for more than 80 counties. Of these, nearly 70 counties will have their absentee ballots by the end of the day today, so they can prepare them for sending to voters who requested them on Sept. 6.\n\nThe preparation of ballots includes various stages.\n\nFirst, once the ballot content is finalized, staff at each county board of elections and staff at the State Board work with ballot printing vendors to generate electronic proofs of the ballots. Elections staff must examine each ballot style created. A ballot style is the specific combination of contests on the ballot that correspond to a voter\u2019s voting jurisdictions (e.g., county commissioner district, state legislative districts, congressional district, etc.). There are more than 1,000 ballot styles across the state.\n\nOnce elections staff carefully proof the contents of the ballot prepared by the printing vendors and approve the ballots for printing, the print vendors test the ballots to ensure they can be read by ballot tabulators.\n\nOnce the ballots pass this test, the vendors will print the physical ballots and ship them to each county board office. Staff at the county board then must package those ballots into outgoing absentee ballot envelopes, to be ready to be mailed to voters when the start of voting begins, which is Sept. 6, 2024, for the upcoming election. These processes take multiple weeks from start to finish. If ballots were ordered reprinted, the process would essentially start again from the beginning.\n\nVotes for Kennedy will be counted in the general election.\n\nUnless a law requires differently, the rule is that votes for a candidate on the ballot will be counted and reported. N.C.G.S. 163-182.15(d) says that when determining the results in a general election, the individuals having the highest number of votes for each office shall be declared elected to the office. Similarly, N.C.G.S. 163-182(1) requires that the election abstract show the votes for each candidate and ballot proposal on the official ballot in the election.\n\nThere are, however, specific situations when the law says votes are not to be counted. For instance, N.C.G.S. 163-182.1(a) provides certain principles when counting ballots, namely to ensure that a voter\u2019s choice for a ballot item is counted. The only exceptions to not counting that vote are when the voter marks the ballot item for more choices than are allowed, referred to as an overvote, or when the voter writes in the name of a candidate who did not qualify as a write-in candidate. In either situation, the law says those votes do not count. As another example, when a candidate dies before a primary and the ballots have already been printed, N.C.G.S. 163-112(d)(2) requires that \u201cvotes cast for the deceased candidate shall not be counted for any purpose.\u201d\n\nThere is no comparable law that directs the county boards of elections not to count a vote when a political party has withdrawn its presidential nominee\u2019s name after it is too late to reprint the ballots. Accordingly, votes for Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. in the general election will be tabulated and reported alongside the votes for other candidates in the presidential contest.",

        "text": "2024 US presidential polls: Harris taps into near-record levels of enthusiasm\nKamala Harris\u2019s entry into the presidential race has given a shot in the arm to Democratic voters, who are now expressing near-record enthusiasm levels, fresh polling data shows.\n\nWhile the figures from Gallup indicate rising enthusiasm among all voters \u2013 including Republicans \u2013 over the past five months, comparative figures show a much steeper increase among Democrats \u2013 indicating that Harris\u2019s replacement of Joe Biden as presidential candidate is the likely driving factor.\n\nThe surging enthusiasm coincides with an improved general polling performance from Harris compared with Biden, who dropped out of the race last month after a poor debate performance that threatened to further depress his already stagnant numbers in survey match-ups against Donald Trump.\n\nA fresh Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Thursday showed Harris leading Trump nationwide by 45% to 41% \u2013 a margin consistent with other surveys since last week\u2019s boisterous Democratic national convention in Chicago that confirmed the US vice-president\u2019s status as the nominee.\n\nHarris\u2019s figures since then have generally enhanced the small leads that she had accrued since her elevation to the top of the Democratic ticket in July, suggesting that her standing has been further boosted by the traditional post-convention bounce that presidential candidates customarily receive.\n\nThe effect of Robert F Kennedy Jr\u2019s decision to suspend his independent presidential campaign and endorse Trump this week is unclear, since the Reuters/Ipsos and other recent surveys were still being conducted at the time of his announcement on 23 August. The Trump campaign claims the endorsement will boost the former president\u2019s chances, even though Kennedy\u2019s once-buoyant poll numbers had declined to about 5% before he pulled out.\n\nBut it is the state of play in certain key battleground states that will decide the outcome of the 5 November election and here, too, Harris is showing a marked improvement over Biden before he left the race.\n\nA Fox News poll on Thursday showed the vice-president with narrow leads in three out of four southern Sun belt states; 48 to 47% in Arizona, and 48 to 46% in both Georgia and Nevada. In the fourth, North Carolina \u2013 which Trump won by just 1.4% in 2020 \u2013 the Republican nominee was ahead by a single point, 48 to 47%.\n\nThe poll represented a big jump on recent numbers recorded by Biden, who trailed Trump by six points in Georgia in April and by five points in Nevada and Arizona as late as June.\n\nIt also triggered an angry reaction from Trump\u2019s campaign, which lambasted the figures in a statement reflecting the stakes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s that time of year again.

What it may guarantee is a high turnout.\n\n\u201cAs a result of elevated election thought and enthusiasm in both parties, voter participation could surpass what it was in 2020, when two-thirds of eligible US adults cast ballots, the highest in over 100 years,\u201d Jones concluded.",

        "text": "August 30, 2024, presidential campaign news\nCNN\u2019s Dana Bash interviews Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz at Kim\u2019s Cafe in Savannah, Georgia, on August 29 Will Lanzoni/CNN\n\nHere are some takeaways from the Democratic ticket\u2019s interview with CNN\u2019s Dana Bash:\n\nFlip-flop on fracking: In 2019, Kamala Harris opposed fracking \u2014 a position that could have proven politically damaging in Pennsylvania, where it\u2019s a huge employer. Now, she says, she supports it.\n\nProgressives have opposed fracking due to concerns about climate change. But under the Inflation Reduction Act, a bill that Harris cast the tie-breaking vote to pass in the Senate and President Joe Biden signed into law in 2022, fracking has expanded.\n\nHarris said she had already changed her position on fracking in 2020, when she said that Biden \u201cwill not end fracking.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I have seen is that we can grow and we can increase a thriving clean energy economy without banning fracking,\u201d she told Bash.\n\nAppointing a Republican to the Cabinet: Asked if she would appoint a Republican to her Cabinet, Harris said: \u201cYes, I would.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one in particular,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have 68 days to go in this election, so I\u2019m not putting the cart before the horse. But I would.\u201d\n\nRefusing to engage in identity politics: Last month, Donald Trump questioned Harris\u2019 racial identity, suggesting she\u2019d previously identified as South Asian but \u201chappened to turn Black\u201d for political purposes.\n\nShaking her head, Harris said Trump\u2019s remark is part of his \u201csame old tired playbook.\u201d\n\n\u201cNext question, please,\u201d she said.\n\nHer refusal to comment further aligns with her campaign\u2019s strategy to avoid leaning into identity politics following Trump\u2019s remarks. It could also indicate how Harris might handle challenges to her race and gender during her first debate with Trump next month.\n\nBiden\u2019s call: Harris said she was having breakfast with her family on July 21 when the phone rang.\n\n\u201cIt was Joe Biden, and he told me what he had decided to do,\u201d Harris said, in her most extensive remarks yet on how she learned the president was ending his reelection bid and endorsing her to replace him at the top of the Democratic ticket.\n\n\u201cI asked him, \u2018Are you sure?\u2019 and he said: \u2018Yes,\u2019\u201d Harris recalled. \u201cMy first thought was not about me, to be honest with you. My first thought was about him.\u201d\n\nBlaming Trump on border security: Trump has made attacking the Biden administration\u2019s handling of the US-Mexico border a signature issue, but Harris said Trump bears much of the blame for the border security problems he bemoans.\n\nShe pointed to his opposition to the bipartisan border security bill hashed out by a group of lawmakers. Asked if she would push that bill if she is elected president, Harris said: \u201cI would make sure that it would come to my desk and I would sign it.\u201d\n\nShe also said she does not support decriminalizing illegally crossing the border into the United States, reversing another position she took in 2019.\n\nWalz says he owns his mistakes: Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Harris\u2019 running mate, was pressed on false claims he\u2019s made, including in a 2018 video in which he refers to \u201cweapons of war, that I carried in war.\u201d\n\nThough Walz served 24 years in the Army National Guard, he was never in a combat zone. He said he misspoke.\n\n\u201cMy wife, the English teacher, told me my grammar\u2019s not always correct,\u201d he said.\n\nWalz had also said in his convention speech that he and his wife used IVF to conceive their children but has since clarified it was a different kind of fertility treatment.\n\n\u201cI certainly own my mistakes when I make them,\u201d he said.\n\nRead the full story.",

        "text": "More than $200m: How Kamala Harris is winning the small donors battle\nWhat is driving small donors to pledge record amounts of money in support of Harris\u2019s bid for the White House?\n\nSince Kamala Harris emerged as the Democratic presidential frontrunner \u2013 and then the party\u2019s official candidate \u2013 following President Joe Biden\u2019s withdrawal from the race a little more than a month ago, donations for her campaign have been pouring in.\n\nHarris\u2019s campaign said this week that it had raised about $540m in that time \u2013 the largest amount raised by any political campaign in such a short period of time.\n\nThis fundraising milestone is significant, said Patrick Frank, former outreach director of ActBlue, the largest online fundraising platform for the Democratic Party and outreach director for Lunda, a platform for small donors fundraising in Europe.\n\n\u201cIt is definitely one of one. This is a unique amount,\u201d he told Al Jazeera. The only parallel? \u201cI would say that there\u2019s probably some comparison out there to disaster relief funds that are able to generate just as much,\u201d he added.\n\nBut in a country where political campaigns are often beholden to large fundraising machines known as super PACs, the Harris campaign also stands out for the dramatic flood of money it is receiving from small donors.\n\nOf the $497m in funding that Harris received as of August 20, roughly 42 percent of the money had come from 631,000 such small donors \u2013 those who contribute less than $200 \u2013 according to Open Secrets, a non-for-profit organisation based in Washington, DC that tracks and publishes data related on political campaign financing.\n\nIn all, candidates for the 2024 US presidential election across the political spectrum have raised roughly $1.5bn so far from small and large donors.\n\nHow does Harris\u2019s funding surge compare with Trump\u2019s war chest?\n\nOverall, Harris has built a commanding funding lead over former President Donald Trump, her Republican opponent in the November election.\n\nAccording to filings with the Federal Election Commission, by the end of July, Harris had approximately $489m in her war chest, compared with $265m for Trump.\n\nIn just the week of the Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Chicago, from August 19 to August 22, when Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, accepted their nominations, their campaign drew $82m in funding, according to a memo from Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon, Harris\u2019s campaign manager.\n\n\u201cThis is the most ever for any presidential campaign in this time span,\u201d Dillon said.\n\nAnd Harris also leads Trump when it comes to small donors: The entrepreneur-turned-politician has secured 32 percent of his campaign funding from small donors, compared with Harris\u2019s 42 percent.\n\nYet Harris still lags behind one previous campaign when it comes to small donor support: During his 2008 run, Barack Obama received roughly 44 percent of his funding from small donors, according to Open Secrets. And Obama bettered that record during his re-election campaign.\n\nWhat is considered a small donation?\n\nIn 1971, the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) was passed to regulate campaign financing. It required candidates to disclose their contributions and spending for their election campaigns.\n\nAlthough the FECA did not explicitly track small donations at the time, a small donation can range anywhere from $1 to $200 sent to a candidate\u2019s political campaign or a political action committee.\n\nTypically, who are small donors?\n\nIn a working paper (not peer-reviewed) published (PDF) by the National Bureau of Economic Research, a private nonprofit organisation, and updated in July 2024, economists Laurent Bouton, Julia Cage, Edgard Dewitte and Vincent Pons tried to break down the demographics of small donors.\n\nThey found that \u201csmall donors tend to be more representative of the overall population than large donors\u201d.\n\nWomen account for 37.5 percent of large donors, as compared with 54.1 percent of small donors.\n\n89.4 percent of large donors are white. Only 3.9 percent are Black, 3.6 percent Hispanic, and 3 percent Asian, against 11.5 percent, 14.5 percent and 5.1 percent respectively in the overall population. Ethnic minorities are also underrepresented among small donors, but less so: 6.7 percent of them are Black, 7.3 percent Hispanic, and 3.5 percent Asian. However small the fraction is of small donors who are ethnic minorities, it is still two-thirds higher than that same fraction for large donors.\n\nAsian. However small the fraction is of small donors who are ethnic minorities, it is still two-thirds higher than that same fraction for large donors. The researchers also found that between 2006 and 2020, the number of contributions increased while mean contribution amounts decreased, from $292 to $60.\n\nWhen did the rise in small donations begin?\n\nAccording to Frank, it was Howard Dean, the former governor of Vermont, who ran for the Democratic nomination in the 2004 presidential election, who brought small donations to the fore.\n\n\u201cOne of the keys to Kamala Harris\u2019s fundraising is the media attention driving the narrative but with Dean, it was actually the fundraising driving the media,\u201d he said.\n\nYet small donations really took off with Barak Obama\u2019s 2007 primary campaign against Hillary Clinton, when he raised a total of $750m, with roughly $335m coming from small donors, according to Open Secrets.\n\nBy Obama\u2019s 2011 primary run for the 2012 US presidential election, the amount contributed by small donors had surged to almost 50 percent. In the process, he doubled the amount of small-donor donations he had received four years earlier.\n\nCandidates who pitch themselves as outsiders, and take on key corporates and Wall Street often end up depending disproportionately on small donors.\n\nAccording to the Guardian in February 2020, Bernie Sanders managed to raise $10m through from 350,000 first-time donors within a week of launching his 2020 presidential campaign. On average, each contribution amounted to approximately $27.\n\nAccording to Frank, Sanders would likely have won a lot more from small donors had he secured the 2020 Democratic Party nomination, which went to Biden.\n\nAlthough political activist Cornel West, competing for the presidency in 2024, has not raised anywhere close to the hundreds of millions of dollars secured by Harris or Trump, he has received 53 percent of the $1.1m in his campaign chest from small donors, according to Open Secrets.\n\nHow has Trump done with small donors?\n\nThough he trails Harris, Trump retains strong support from small donors, said analysts.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump has been one of the most successful small donor fundraisers of the last decade,\u201d Frank said. \u201cHe\u2019s in the top three. It\u2019s going to be Harris, Biden, Trump, Bernie.\u201d\n\nAnd while Harris is far ahead in overall funding, there too, Trump has had his moments of surge \u2013 including among small donors.\n\nAfter Trump was convicted on 34 felony charges in Manhattan in May, the Trump campaign announced that it had raised $52.8m within 24 hours. This overwhelming surge of donations caused the WinRed platform, a platform for accepting small GOP donations, to crash due to the high traffic it received.\n\nYet in July, Trump\u2019s campaign raised $139m, far less than the $310m reported by the Harris campaign, despite the focus on the Republican National Convention and an assassination attempt on Trump.\n\nWhat is driving the rise in small donations?\n\nCampaigns have been able to utilise social media and online platforms in ways that were much harder in a pre-digital era, analysts said, resulting in a shift towards small-dollar online donations. Digital technology has made it easier for campaigns to reach a wide audience and mobilise grassroots support, and for small donors to contribute financially.\n\nWhether small donors will be able to compete with large donors in terms of political influence remains unclear, but Frank remains optimistic.\n\n\u201cMy vision for what an ideal situation would be looks a lot like the Elizabeth Warren campaign in 2020,\u201d he said. Warren, according to Frank, had enough wealthy donors lining up. \u201cBut the rule on the campaign was there are no advantages to the amount that you gave me.\u201d\n\nThat, he said, should be the goal for political campaigns.\n\n\u201cIf you can give more, give more, but don\u2019t expect anything in return for it,\u201d he said. \u201cI already think we\u2019re at a place in the Democratic Party where big donors are frustrated that they don\u2019t have the influence that they [think they should] have.\u201d",

        "text": "US Election: 8 crucial swing states that will decide next US president\nAs the 2024 U.S. presidential election approaches, the political landscape is more polarised than ever and the outcome is likely to hinge on the voters in eight key swing states. According to the latest ratings by the Cook Political Report, these states remain highly competitive and could be decisive in determining whether Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Donald J. Trump crosses the crucial 270 electoral vote threshold needed to win the presidency. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris (AP)\n\nAlso Read: Guide to understanding Electoral College\n\nThe Battle for Electoral Votes\n\nIf both candidates manage to secure the states where they currently have solid, likely, or lean support, the race will come down to seven toss-up states and one district where the outcome is far from certain. Kamala Harris would need to secure 44 electoral votes from these toss-up states to win, while Donald Trump would require 51 electoral votes.\n\nAlso Read: How will the next US President be elected\n\nThe 8 key Swing States where the US election will be won or lost\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at the eight states that could tip the scales in this closely watched election:\n\nPennsylvania (19 Electoral Votes)\n\n2020 Margin: Biden +1.2%\n\n2024 Polls: Harris <1% lead\n\nPennsylvania has long been a battleground state, and it remains one of the most critical in 2024. In 2020, Biden narrowly won Pennsylvania, which proved essential to his victory. With 19 electoral votes up for grabs, both campaigns are expected to invest heavily in winning over the state's diverse electorate.\n\nGeorgia (16 Electoral Votes)\n\n- 2020 Margin: Biden +0.2%\n\n- 2024 Polling: Trump <1% lead\n\nWith 16 electoral votes its shift from a reliably Republican state to a swing state in 2020 Georgia is in the spotlight an hot favourite for candidates during campaign trail. Biden\u2019s razor-thin victory in Georgia helped secure his win, but Trump is aiming to reclaim the state in 2024.\n\nNorth Carolina (16 Electoral Votes)\n\n2020 Margin: Trump +1.3%\n\n2024 Polls: Not enough data\n\nNorth Carolina has been a perennial swing state, and the race is expected to be close once again in 2024. Although Trump won the state by a small margin in 2020, recent polling suggests a highly competitive race this time around. The state\u2019s 16 electoral votes could be decisive.\n\nMichigan (15 Electoral Votes)\n\n2020 Margin: Biden +2.8%\n\n2024 Polling: Harris +2% lead\n\nMichigan\u2019s working-class voters played a pivotal role in Biden\u2019s 2020 victory, helping him flip the state back to the Democrats after Trump\u2019s win in 2016. With 15 electoral votes, Michigan remains a key target for both campaigns, particularly in the industrial heartland.\n\nArizona (11 Electoral Votes)\n\n2020 Margin: Biden +0.3%\n\n2024 Polls: Trump <1% lead\n\nArizona\u2019s changing demographics, including a growing Latino population, have made it a battleground state in recent elections. Biden\u2019s narrow victory in 2020 was a significant shift, but Trump is determined to win back Arizona\u2019s 11 electoral votes in 2024.\n\nWisconsin (10 Electoral Votes)\n\n2020 Margin: Biden +0.6%\n\n2024 Polling: Harris +1% lead\n\nWisconsin, another Rust Belt state, was instrumental in Biden\u2019s 2020 win. The state\u2019s 10 electoral votes are up for grabs again in 2024, with both parties focusing on appealing to the state\u2019s mix of urban and rural voters.\n\nNevada (6 Electoral Votes)\n\n2020 Margin: Biden +2.4%\n\n2024 Polls: Not enough data\n\nNevada has consistently leaned Democratic in recent elections, but the margins have been close. With 6 electoral votes, the state could be a crucial part of Harris\u2019s path to victory, but Trump\u2019s campaign will be working hard to flip it.\n\nNebraska\u2019s 2nd Congressional District (1 Electoral Vote)\n\n2020 Margin: Biden +6.5%\n\n2024 Polls: Not enough data\n\nWhile Nebraska as a whole is a solidly Republican state, it allocates electoral votes by congressional district, and the 2nd District, centered around Omaha, is a toss-up. Biden won this district in 2020, securing a single but potentially decisive electoral vote.\n\nAs the campaigns intensify and Election Day approaches, these eight swing states will be the primary focus of both parties. The strategies deployed, the issues emphasized, and the voter turnout efforts in these states will ultimately determine who wins the presidency in 2024.",

Most Taylor Swift fans probably weren't pleased with the graphic that the former president's social media account posted on August 13 featuring his 2024 GOP platform. Given that they have different political philosophies, Swift may find it difficult to maintain their friendship during election season if she decides to support Kamala Harris With a Zoom rally featuring Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Carole King on Tuesday, August 27, the Swifties for Harris campaign managed to raise a whopping $140,000. Although Swift has not yet endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, her past political endorsements of President Joe Biden in 2020 suggest that she leans left.The pop singer opened up to The Guardian in 2019 about her feelings regarding Donald Trump. Gaslighting the American people into believing that if you hate the president, you hate America is something highly abhorrent. People are allowed to disagree, dissent, and debate because it is supposed to be a democracy and not an autocracy. The Swifties are deeply affected by her strong feelings regarding the divisive politician since Mahomes appears to support some of the former president's policies, such as keeping men out of women's sports, etc.On Saturday, August 24, Mahomes posted on her Instagram Story after sensing the intensity of the Cruel Summer singer's fan base. Through Newsweek, Mahomes wrote that there have to be some ingrained problems from childhood that you are unwilling to address to be a hater as an adult. She added another post two days later, saying that one can disagree with someone and still love them, despite the tone of the world today. One can be kind and hold different opinions at the same time, as quoted in a report by She Knows.Swift and Mahomes may be in the agree-to-disagree stage of their friendship, but things could get complicated if Kamala Harris receives formal support. The Hollywood Reporter was informed by Celebrity Politics author Mark Wheeler that as the female vote will be crucial in swaying the election, Swift's endorsement could be crucial in influencing young female voters and reinforcing the notion that Harris, like Obama before her, is presiding over the support of a movement rather than just a demographic in the national votes. Swift's extraordinary popularity could support any candidate, and her endorsement could signal a major change in the campaign's narrative.Although it might make Swift's friendship with Mahomes a sensitive political campaign issue, it doesn't appear that she is giving up on spending time with her pals. Although her friends' political opinions differ from her own, it appears that Swift is tolerant of them.Because it goes against Taylor Swift's political stance, Brittany Mahomes' support for Trump is divisive and could cause rifts between their fan base and friendship.The possibility that Swift will support Kamala Harris could be complicated by her friendship with Mahomes, a Trump supporter who could cause awkward dynamics in the election.",

Knight Foundation today announced they will work together to ensure AP\u2019s election content and services are accessible to local newsrooms in battleground states ahead of the U.S. presidential election.\n\n\n\nSelect nonprofit and local newsrooms in key states including Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona, Nevada that are members of the Institute for Nonprofit News and Local Independent Online News Publishers qualify.\n\n\n\nINN and LION members interested in receiving AP\u2019s election content and services at no charge should sign up online.\n\n\n\nAP will collaborate with LION and INN on the portfolio of content and services that will be offered to local newsrooms so they can better provide their audiences with fact-based, nonpartisan news on the upcoming elections.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor over 175 years, AP\u2019s vote count, race calls and coverage have allowed newsrooms across the U.S. to tell the full story of the run-up to Election Day and inform their communities about the results,\u201d said AP Senior Vice President and Executive Editor Julie Pace. \u201cWith funding from the Knight Foundation, we are thrilled to expand access to this crucial information to local outlets, equipping these newsrooms with the tools they need to inform citizens with election facts.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOur hope is that this support not only will provide voters with the information they need to make informed decisions in November, but that it also provides news organizations with the boost they need to sustain their capacity to engage communities well into the future,\u201d said Knight Foundation President and CEO Maribel P\u00e9rez Wadsworth.\n\n\n\n\u201cMembers of the INN Network regularly do the most consequential journalism around, and are sometimes the only source of accurate, independent coverage in a community,\u201d said Jonathan Kealing, chief network officer of the Institute for Nonprofit News. \u201cThis collaboration with AP will allow them to augment their own essential local coverage with the AP\u2019s vast array of election reporting and resources to benefit their communities.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cLION members are already doing the hard work of covering elections at the national, state and especially the community level, and gaining access to the breadth of resources produced by The Associated Press will be a shot in the arm during this crucial election season,\u201d said Chris Krewson, executive director of LION Publishers. \u201cOur members are deeply connected to the communities they are covering and it\u2019s crucial to support their efforts to provide high-quality news and information so communities can make informed decisions at the polls.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe initiative is limited to INN and LION members whose annual revenue does not exceed $5 million.\n\n\n\nThis effort builds on AP\u2019s work to support the local news ecosystem in an election year, including an effort with INN and the Google News Initiative to make election results and graphics available to qualifying INN members.\n\n\n\nabout ap\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.

It drew controversy partly because it features a dramatized scene of an alleged assault on Trump's first wife .",
        "text": "Donald Trump biopic 'The Apprentice' sets pre-election release date\n\u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d a film dramatizing Donald Trump\u2019s rise in New York City real estate and his relationship with political power broker Roy Cohn, has found a distributor that will debut the film in the final stretch of the presidential election, according to a source with knowledge of the deal.\n\nThe independent distributor Briarcliff Entertainment plans to release the movie on Oct. 11, the source said. Sebastian Stan stars as Trump and Jeremy Strong of \u201cSuccession\u201d fame plays Cohn, one of the former president\u2019s mentors.\n\n\u201cThe Apprentice\u201d premiered in May at the 77th Cannes Film Festival, where it immediately turned into a sociopolitical lightning rod. In a statement at the time, Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung blasted the movie as \u201cpure malicious defamation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will be filing a lawsuit to address the blatantly false assertions from these pretend filmmakers,\u201d Cheung said. \u201cThis garbage is pure fiction which sensationalizes lies that have been long debunked.\u201d (It\u2019s unclear whether the campaign has filed a lawsuit.)\n\nIn response to a request for comment Friday, Cheung sent NBC News a similarly worded statement excoriating the movie.\n\nThe film drew controversy partly because it features a dramatized scene of an alleged incident in which Trump sexually assaulted his first wife, Ivana, who is played by Maria Bakalova from \u201cBorat Subsequent Moviefilm.\u201d\n\nIvana Trump, in her 1990 divorce deposition, alleged Donald Trump raped her. He denied the allegation, and she later said she was not speaking literally but, rather, felt she had been violated by her ex-husband. She died in 2022.\n\n\u201cThe Apprentice\u201d was directed by Iranian Danish filmmaker Ali Abbasi and written by Vanity Fair journalist Gabriel Sherman, who has covered Trump and his political allies for more than a decade. Cohn died of AIDS-related complications in 1986, though he denied he was HIV-positive. He was 59.\n\nAbbasi\u2019s representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Trump campaign\u2019s statement.\n\nWhen asked by reporters at Cannes about the Trump team\u2019s threat of a lawsuit, Abbasi suggested the former president should see the film.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t necessarily think that this is a movie he would dislike,\u201d Abbasi said. \u201cI don\u2019t necessarily think he would like it. I think he would be surprised, you know?\"\n\n\"I would offer to go and meet him wherever he wants and talk about the context of the movie, have a screening and have a chat afterwards, if that\u2019s interesting to anyone at the Trump campaign,\u201d the director added.\n\nBriarcliff Entertainment has experience releasing controversial projects. The company distributed \u201cThe Dissident,\u201d a 2020 documentary about the murder of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, after other studios balked.\n\nThe company also provided distribution for \u201cFahrenheit 11/9,\u201d a 2018 documentary by the progressive filmmaker Michael Moore that chronicles the 2016 presidential election and the first two years of Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\nThe news that \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d had secured a distribution deal was first reported by Puck.",

        "text": "Why a leading expert on gun violence is sounding alarms about the 2024 election\nis a senior correspondent at Vox. She writes features on a wide range of subjects, including traffic safety, gun violence, and the legal system. Prior to Vox, she worked as a writer for New York magazine, GQ, ESPN the Magazine, and other publications.\n\nGun violence researchers are also concerned. Garen Wintemute, a physician and founder of UC Davis\u2019s Violence Prevention Research Program, has been studying gun violence since the 1980s. In late 2021, the center turned its attention to political violence. Last year, it published the results of a large survey digging into Americans\u2019 beliefs on the issue.\n\n\u201cSmall but concerning proportions of the population consider violence, including lethal violence, to be usually or always justified to advance political objectives,\u201d Wintemute and his colleagues write. Nearly 19 percent of respondents said that \u201chaving a strong leader\u201d was more important than having a democracy. Almost 14 percent predicted a civil war in the United States in the next few years, and just under eight percent said that in the next few years, if they found themselves in a situation where they believed political violence was justified, they planned to be armed with a gun.\n\nThe center is preparing to release a new survey this fall, with its latest insights on the appetite for political violence in the United States. Before they do, Wintemute shared with Vox some early takeaways from its findings, along with some ideas about what people can do to create a country less vulnerable to political violence.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhat does the 2024 data reveal about the risk for political violence in the US?\n\nGaren Wintemute: We\u2019re continuing to see a sustained level of support for the idea of political violence, and of willingness to be a combatant if civil war comes about. There is a clear connection with some subsets of firearm ownership, but also with racism and sexism and homophobia \u2014 pretty much any brand of fear and loathing you might want to mention.\n\nWhat we\u2019re seeing bears out hunches and predictions people had years ago, but there are two pieces of good news: One is that gun purchasing did eventually fall back to essentially baseline levels [from 2020 and 2021.] It\u2019s a leading indicator and we watch it like a hawk. The other piece of good news is that rates of gun violence were frighteningly high in 2020 and 2021, but fell in 2022 and 2023. So far, we\u2019re not seeing an increase from 2023 in 2024.\n\nBut I\u2019ll put an asterisk on that. We\u2019re living through this in real time. I think there\u2019s probably agreement among the people who look at this closely that the set of circumstances most likely to produce political violence in this country in the next few months are a closely contested election, with momentum swinging to Democrats, and with high-profile instances of political violence having already occurred.\n\nThose are the circumstances we are in today. The barometer fluctuates a little, but right after the assassination attempt I got asked, did you think this was going to happen, what happened to Donald Trump in Pennsylvania? You can\u2019t predict the specifics, but for weeks, I\u2019d been ending every day, thinking: Wow, we made it another day. Yes, it\u2019s going to happen. With that same level of certainty, I think it will happen again. Whether it will involve an elected official as a target, I can\u2019t say. But we\u2019ve opened the door to political violence this election season, and there are still some leaders using rhetoric that enables violence. And we will all pay a price for that, I suspect.\n\nYou don\u2019t think this is the last we\u2019ve seen of political violence this election cycle?\n\nI personally think that large-scale political violence is really, really unlikely. I feel more sanguine about that prediction, given our 2024 data. We asked people, suppose that there were a right-wing insurgency or a left-wing insurgency. Would you support either over the government? In both cases, most respondents said neither. I take that as good news. Large-scale violence is really unlikely. A few months from now, I might feel differently.\n\nBut sporadic outbreaks, particularly if the battleground states remain really close \u2014 is it possible? Sure. Might there be attempts to intimidate election officials? Absolutely.\n\nMost of us, most of the time, and some of us, all of the time, do not think that violence is how we solve problems in this country. We will react negatively when people use violence.\n\nWhat we really need to work on is producing a culture that is not receptive to the propagation of political violence, so it might happen here and there but we won\u2019t see a sustained chain of events.\n\nWhere is political violence most likely to come from?\n\nProbably the most influential social movement in the US right now is Christian nationalism, which holds not just that the United States, by tradition, is and ought to be a Christian nation, but that end times are coming and we need to be ready.\n\nI think of this partly as a researcher, and partly as a clinician. Psychological injury is like physical injury; it can heal, but it leaves a scar. It leaves the person changed. So people who have sustained psychological injury after injury, or they\u2019ve seen their privileged status in this society erode, need to make sense of it all. So how do some make sense of it all? They find somebody to blame, which is where you get xenophobia and replacement theory, and so on. You find a way to make it right. You start to think, I\u2019m willing to kill and be killed in order to preserve the thing I believe in. That is how wars start.\n\nWhat works at preventing political violence? Do we know?\n\nWe do have some data on this. We asked people: If a civil war broke out, how likely would you be to do any of the following things? They started with leaving the country and ended with killing a noncombatant from the other side, with a bunch of options in between. In the middle was participate as a combatant. It was a small number of people who said yes.\n\nWe asked the people who said it was not at all likely that they\u2019d participate as a combatant, would you change your position from if you were urged to do so by family, friends, religious leaders, community leaders, or the media? And conversely, we asked the people who said they would be combatant, would you change your position in response to those same groups?\n\nThe people who started with saying \u201cI\u2019m not going to be a combatant\u201d were not open to change. It didn\u2019t matter the source of influence. For the would-be combatants, a big number would switch if their family asked them not to, or friends, or even some media sources. I was literally dancing around this office, seeing the numbers on the screen, because that leads directly to intervention.\n\nBasically, the vast majority of people out there who do not think violence is justified need to talk it up, because you\u2019re not going to change your mind and we can prove it. But the people on the other side, if you talk to them \u2014 whether we\u2019re talking about individuals talking to family and friends, or media outlets putting it in their programming \u2014 we can create a climate of nonacceptance for political violence. And in doing that, we can expect that it will work.\n\nYou\u2019ve read 1 article in the last month Here at Vox, we're unwavering in our commitment to covering the issues that matter most to you \u2014 threats to democracy, immigration, reproductive rights, the environment, and the rising polarization across this country.

        "text": "Harris says she won't ban fracking. What to know about the controversial topic\nHarris says she won't ban fracking. What to know about the controversial topic\n\ntoggle caption Keith Srakocic/AP\n\nIn a sit-down interview with CNN on Thursday, Vice President Harris said she wouldn\u2019t ban fracking if elected president, a reversal of her position during her first presidential run.\n\nThe Democratic nominee attempted to explain why her position has changed from being against fracking to being in favor of it.\n\n\u201cWhat I have seen is that we can grow, and we can increase a clean energy economy without banning fracking,\u201d she told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash.\n\nWhen she first ran for president in 2019, Harris had said she was firmly in favor of banning fracking \u2014 a stance she later abandoned when she joined President Biden\u2019s campaign as his running mate, to side with his opposition to such a ban. Despite the Biden administration's sweeping initiatives to address climate change, the president has also overseen the largest oil boom the U.S. \u2014 or the world \u2014 has experienced.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIt\u2019s been years since the issue has seen this much national attention. Before this week, the last time Google saw higher search interest for \u201cfracking\u201d was in October 2020, a month before the last presidential election. As for the Republican ticket, former President Donald Trump is expected to try to convince voters otherwise \u2014 that unlike him, Harris wants to halt fracking.\n\nIt\u2019s a particularly key issue for voters in Pennsylvania, a critical swing state where the fracking industry has driven industrial and economic growth in the western and northern parts of the state.\n\nIf you\u2019re in need of a refresher, here\u2019s a quick overview on fracking.\n\n\n\nWhat is fracking?\n\nFracking \u2014 shorthand for hydraulic fracturing \u2014 is the process of extracting gas or oil deep underground using a high-pressure mixture of water, sand and chemicals to break up rock.\n\nFracking has allowed oil and gas companies to tap into vast energy reservoirs that once seemed impossible to develop.\n\n\n\nWhy is it controversial?\n\nThose in favor highlight its upsides: The fracking boom has lowered the price of oil and gas around the world, cut U.S. reliance on foreign oil production and brought in new jobs to revitalize economies. It\u2019s also helped the U.S. shift away from coal production for power plants and toward natural gas.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe drilling technique, however, hasn\u2019t resolved the country\u2019s dependence on fossil fuels, which contribute to climate change.\n\nFracking also dredges up concerns about air and water quality. Drilling for and transporting gas can lead to the leakage of methane, a potent greenhouse gas that warms the planet faster than carbon dioxide.\n\nFor years, research has shown that fracking depletes water levels, produces toxic air pollution and generates noise in nearby communities. It\u2019s also been linked to drinking water contamination and earthquakes.\n\nHydraulic fracturing itself can trigger minor seismic activity \u2014 and the underground disposal of wastewater used in the process has caused larger, destructive quakes, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.\n\n\n\nHow much fracking is happening in the U.S.?\n\nOver the past decade, fracking production by volume has quadrupled in the U.S., and overall shows no signs of slowing. Last year, the country's average daily oil production was 12.9 million barrels \u2014 a record high, according to the Energy Information Administration. Almost two-thirds of that oil production was captured by fracking, also a record high (8.4 million barrels per day). Also in 2023, natural gas production from fracking was a record 81.5 billion cubic feet per day.\n\nA huge portion of that fracking is happening in what\u2019s known as the Permian region of western Texas and eastern New Mexico, which is home to more active rigs than all of the other 48 states combined.",

Bill Pugliano/Getty Images\n\nFormer President Donald Trump claimed in an interview that aired Sunday that he had \u201cevery right to\u201d interfere with a presidential election as he faces an updated indictment in the federal election interference case against him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so crazy that my poll numbers go up. Whoever heard \u2014 you get indicted for interfering with a presidential election where you have every right to do it \u2014 you get indicted and your poll numbers go up,\u201d Trump said in an interview with Fox News.\n\nSpecial counsel Jack Smith filed a superseding indictment last week in his investigation into alleged efforts by the former president and his allies to overturn the 2020 election. The new indictment slims down the allegations against the 2024 Republican presidential nominee in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s controversial immunity ruling, though none of the four charges have been dropped.\n\nTrump also said in the interview that the way Vice President Kamala Harris \u201ctreated Mike Pence was horrible.\u201d\n\nPence, who served as Trump\u2019s vice president, has been critical of Trump after the deadly insurrection at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, and has said he won\u2019t endorse Trump in 2024. Pence was targeted that day by a mob of pro-Trump supporters \u2014 including some chanting \u201cHang Mike Pence\u201d \u2014 who were trying to stop the election results from being certified. Trump continues to falsely claim that Pence had the power to stop the certification of the results.\n\nTrump was initially talking about Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s Senate confirmation hearing, which then-Sen. Harris took part in.\n\n\u201cShe was vicious. Oh, she was the most vicious,\u201d Trump said of Harris. \u201cShe was going after them. Just like with Mike Pence, where she said, \u2018You\u2019re interrupting me, I want to talk.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe former president, who is set to debate Harris next week, was referencing the viral moment from the 2020 vice presidential debate in which Harris said to Pence, \u201cI\u2019m speaking\u201d when he was interrupting her.",

        "text": "August 31, 2024, presidential campaign news\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Vice President Kamala Harris sit for an interview with CNN\u2019s Dana Bash in Savannah, Georgia, on August 29. Will Lanzoni/CNN\n\nCNN conducted the first joint interview of Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, on Thursday.\n\nHere\u2019s how the Democratic ticket responded to some key questions from CNN\u2019s Dana Bash:\n\nFlip-flop on fracking: In 2019, Kamala Harris opposed fracking \u2014 a position that could have proven politically damaging in Pennsylvania, where it\u2019s a huge employer. Now, she says, she supports it.\n\nProgressives have opposed fracking due to concerns about climate change. But under the Inflation Reduction Act, a bill that Harris cast the tie-breaking vote to pass in the Senate and President Joe Biden signed into law in 2022, fracking has expanded.\n\nHarris said she had already changed her position on fracking in 2020, when she said that Biden \u201cwill not end fracking.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I have seen is that we can grow and we can increase a thriving clean energy economy without banning fracking,\u201d she told Bash.\n\nAppointing a Republican to the Cabinet: Asked if she would appoint a Republican to her Cabinet, Harris said: \u201cYes, I would.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one in particular,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have 68 days to go in this election, so I\u2019m not putting the cart before the horse. But I would.\u201d\n\nRefusing to engage in identity politics: Last month, Donald Trump questioned Harris\u2019 racial identity, suggesting she\u2019d previously identified as South Asian but \u201chappened to turn Black\u201d for political purposes.\n\nShaking her head, Harris said Trump\u2019s remark is part of his \u201csame old tired playbook.\u201d\n\n\u201cNext question, please,\u201d she said.\n\nHer refusal to comment further aligns with her campaign\u2019s strategy to avoid leaning into identity politics following Trump\u2019s remarks.\n\nBlaming Trump on border security: Trump has made attacking the Biden administration\u2019s handling of the US-Mexico border a signature issue, but Harris said Trump bears much of the blame for the border security problems he bemoans.\n\nShe pointed to his opposition to the bipartisan border security bill hashed out by a group of lawmakers. Asked if she would push that bill if she is elected president, Harris said: \u201cI would make sure that it would come to my desk and I would sign it.\u201d\n\nRead more takeaways from the exclusive interview.",

        "text": "The lessons of America\u2019s deadliest presidential election in 1872\nIn the aftermath of the U.S. Civil War turning the American nation into a functional and peaceful political body proved to be almost impossible. For example the presidential election of 1872 was one of the most contentious and deadly in American history.\n\nThe election occurred during the Reconstruction era, a period characterized by deep divisions in the United States as the nation grappled with the consequences of the Civil War and the integration of formerly enslaved African Americans into the political system with the power of the vote.\n\nNationally, the election saw Ulysses S. Grant, the incumbent Republican president, running for re-election. The Democratic Party was in such disarray it didn\u2019t nominate a candidate for president but endorsed Horace Greeley, the candidate of the Liberal Republican Party.\n\nThe race was contentious due to widespread dissatisfaction with Grant's administration, particularly its handling of corruption and the enforcement of Reconstruction policies in the South. Greeley\u2019s candidacy quickly faltered as he failed to unite the various factions that opposed Grant.\n\nThe situation was especially volatile in Louisiana, where Reconstruction had produced a highly polarized and violent political environment. The state was a hotbed of racial and political tension, with newly enfranchised Black voters supporting the Republican Party, while white Democrats, many of whom were former Confederates, resisted Reconstruction efforts to transform the South\u2019s political landscape. In Louisiana, the election of 1872 was marred by widespread voter intimidation, violence and murderous attacks against African Americans and their Republican allies.\n\nThe politics of Louisiana in 1872 were dominated by the intense struggle between these two factions. The Republican government, led by Governor Henry Clay Warmoth, faced fierce opposition from the Democrats and white supremacist groups like the White League, who sought to overthrow Republican rule through any means necessary, including mass murder. This conflict culminated in the notorious Colfax Massacre of 1873, where white supremacists killed over 100 Black men who were defending a local courthouse. Although the massacre occurred after the election, it was directly connected to the tensions and violence that characterized the 1872 electoral process in Louisiana.\n\nThe election in Louisiana was also contentious due to accusations of massive fraud and electoral manipulation. Both Republicans and Democrats claimed victory, leading to a prolonged dispute over the results. The federal government eventually intervened, recognizing the Republican candidates, but the bitterness and violence of the election left a lasting scar on the state\u2019s political landscape.\n\nThe presidential election of 1872 bears eerie similarities to the political divide in America today. Both periods are marked by deep polarization, with starkly divided political factions that seem irreconcilable. In 1872 there were high tensions between those supporting federal efforts to enforce civil rights and those, including the Ku Klux Klan, who were using violence to keep Black men from voting. This mirrors today\u2019s divisions over issues like racial justice, voting rights, and the role of federal government in addressing social issues.\n\nAdditionally, the 1872 election was rife with accusations of corruption, electoral fraud, and political violence, particularly in states like Louisiana. These elements echo current concerns over election integrity, voter suppression, and the potential for political violence.\n\nJust as the 1872 election exposed the fragility of American democracy during Reconstruction, the current political climate highlights the challenges of maintaining a stable and functioning democracy amid profound ideological divisions.\n\nBoth eras also feature debates over the influence of media and the power of political rhetoric and the publishing of outright lies to inflame passions.\n\nGuest:\n\nDana Bash is CNN's Chief Political Correspondent. She is the co-author with David Fisher of \"America's Deadliest Election,\" a book about the little-known 1872 Louisiana gubernatorial election.\n\n\"The Source\" is a live call-in program airing Mondays through Thursdays from 12-1 p.m. Leave a message before the program at (210) 615-8982.

He himself has not traveled to many fund-raising events across the country \u2014 a point of frustration for some of his fund-raisers who sometimes have to travel to Mr. Trump\u2019s own properties to get access to the candidate. Some traditional Republican donors who are uncomfortable with Mr. Trump are focusing their energies on down-ballot campaigns.",

        "text": "How Elon Musk\u2019s endorsement of Trump may have backfired\nTesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk listens to President Donald Trump during a meeting with business leaders in the State Dining Room of the White House in Washington, Feb. 3, 2017. Evan Vucci | AP\n\nwatch now\n\nwatch now\n\nBrendan Steinhauser, a Republican strategist in Texas, said Democrats appear to be pulling from the playbook they used in 2012 to defeat Mitt Romney, who also appeared to hold a casual attitude toward job cuts. \"They want to make Trump, Elon and people like them look like plutocrats,\" he said. Steinhauser said there's a danger for Republicans that the message could resonate in strong union states like Michigan. \"It can land if delivered effectively. I don't think it will land, but it can,\" he said, adding that it's tough for any one message to break through in a crowded media environment. Musk has a long record of opposing organized labor and has fought allegations of illegal anti-worker activity at his companies Tesla, SpaceX and X. In 2018, he tweeted that unionized Tesla workers would lose stock options, which Tesla's lawyers said was protected \"employer speech.\" In January, Musk responded to allegations from the National Labor Relations Board against SpaceX with a countersuit asking a federal court to declare the NLRB's system of administrative law judges unconstitutional. Labor union leaders have been harshly critical of Trump's time in office, citing his appointment of conservatives to the NLRB and the federal courts. At the same time, Trump has sought to maintain some ties to organized labor, inviting some union leaders to the White House while he was president and continuing to court the Teamsters.\n\nRepublican presidential candidate and former U.S. President Donald Trump meets with leaders of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters at their headquarters on January 31, 2024 in Washington, DC. Chip Somodevilla | Getty Images\n\nSeth Harris, a former labor policy adviser to President Joe Biden and a senior fellow at the Burnes Center for Social Change at Northeastern University, said he believes Trump wants to be ambiguous on the subject of labor unions, a goal that he said is now much more difficult. \"Elon Musk created the opportunity that Donald Trump took to unmask himself as rabidly anti-union, and he did that by praising Elon Musk's anti-union, union-busting perspective and endorsing the idea of illegally firing striking workers,\" he said. Harris, who is not related to Kamala Harris, said he views Musk's endorsement as a net negative. \"No one views Elon Musk as a voice of the middle class,\" he said. \"Musk is a rapacious corporate overlord who did everything in his power to destroy organizing efforts at Tesla and also at SpaceX.\" David Nasaw, the author of books on business magnates such as William Randolph Hearst and Andrew Carnegie, questioned Musk's ability to sway voters: \"Even those who think he's a genius with regard to AI and tech and space travel, that doesn't translate into presidential campaigns.\" \"I'm trying to think of the demographics that are going to be swayed by Musk repeating Trump's attacks,\" he added. \"If they don't believe Trump, are they going to suddenly come to his side because Musk says he's right?\"\n\nNasaw said he sees a parallel with Hearst, a newspaper and radio baron who tried and failed to defeat President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1936 and 1940 by using his media empire to stir up opposition. Musk showed similar aspirations in 2022 when he bought X, and he frequently uses the app to attack Harris and Biden. \"When it came to elections, nobody really trusted Hearst and there was no reason to trust Hearst. I think the same is true with Musk,\" he said. \"Once upon a time there was this legion of Musk bros who hung on his every word \u2014 who believed he was not only a genius but a genius who was dedicated to saving the planet,\" he said. \"I don't think that's the case anymore.\" Nasaw said he believes Musk has become \"too far out there\" to attract widespread support, citing Musk's antisemitic statements and his views about birth rates.",

        "text": "US polls: Is Kamala Harris pulling ahead of Donald Trump in key swing states?\nWith only two months until the US elections in November, polls ahead of the Labour Day 2024 weekend show Vice President Kamala Harris holding a narrow lead over Donald Trump in key battleground states.\n\nFormer US President and Republican nominee Donald Trump initially made gains against his Democratic challenger, Kamala Harris, in the presidential race. However, according to a report by NBC News, Harris is performing better than Trump in nearly every national survey, even within the margins of error.\n\nAccording to Pew Research, the margin of error represents \u201chow close we can reasonably expect a survey result to fall relative to the true population value.\u201d\n\nThe latest Wall Street Journal polls show Kamala Harris getting 48 percent votes, while Donald Trump has consistently polled at 47 percent, within the margin of error.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal, EPIC-MRA Michigan, and Bloomberg/Morning Consult surveys in Georgia and Michigan all show him at the exact same number. This marks a reversal from the polls seen before Joe Biden's withdrawal.\n\nAlso Read | Trump shows dance moves at Moms for Liberty event, netizens ask this\n\nSwing state polls Bloomberg/Morning Consult polls indicate Harris has surpassed Trump, within the margin of error, in Georgia (50 percent), Michigan (49 percent), Nevada (50 percent), and Pennsylvania (51 percent).\n\nIn Wisconsin, a key swing state, the Vice President leads Trump by a wider margin of 53 percent.\n\nArizona and North Carolina, on the other hand, have shown a tight contest between Trump and Harris. This contrasts sharply with Joe Biden's performance during his re-election campaign when he struggled to gain traction in Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, and North Carolina.\n\nJoe Biden was trailing Donald Trump Before Kamala Harris took over as the Democratic candidate, Biden was trailing Trump, much before the US Presidential debate on June 27. Despite narrow margins in the Great Lakes swing states and larger gaps in the Sun Belt, Harris is performing better, and voters see her as a more trusted leader overall.\n\nAlso Read | Trump issues statement from Gold Star families defending Arlington Cemetery visit and ripping Harris",

        "text": "September 2, 2024, presidential campaign news\nVice President Kamala Harris and President Joe Biden arrive at a campaign event in Pittsburgh, on Monday, September 2. Jacquelyn Martin/AP\n\nDemocrats had a busy campaign schedule this Labor Day, with Vice President Kamala Harris, President Joe Biden and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz spending the day appealing to union workers in major swing states.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, on the other hand, mostly stayed out of the spotlight as the two candidates gear up for next week\u2019s debate.\n\nHere\u2019s what happened on the campaign trail today:\n\nHarris supports a domestically owned US Steel: Harris said for the first time that US Steel should remain domestically owned, saying during a campaign stop in Pittsburgh that it is \u201cvital for our nation to maintain strong American steel companies.\u201d Her remarks echoed Biden\u2019s stance against a proposed sale of US Steel to Nippon Steel, Japan\u2019s biggest steelmaker. During an earlier event in Detroit, Harris also vowed to ensure the \u201cPRO Act,\u201d legislation that would ensure workers\u2019 rights to unionize and collectively bargain for workplace changes, and to \u201cend union busting once and for all.\u201d\n\nBiden goes back to his roots in Pennsylvania: Biden emerged as a powerful surrogate at a joint event with Harris in Pittsburgh, reappearing in a city that he has often visited over the course of his political career and attempting to boost Harris in the battleground state of Pennsylvania. Biden said that he \u201ccelebrated many Labor Days in Pittsburgh\u201d and that it was \u201cgood to be back to so many great friends.\u201d\n\nWalz\u2019s motorcade gets into a crash: While en route to an event in Milwaukee, several vehicles in Walz\u2019s motorcade were involved in a crash, and some passengers were taken to a local hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. Walz, who was not injured, made it to the event, where he touted that he was in \u201cthe pocket\u201d of unions, pitching himself as a working-class vice presidential candidate as he tests his campaigning skills in the Midwestern \u201cblue wall.\u201d\n\nTrump stays out of the spotlight: The former president and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, had no scheduled events Monday. Trump, in an interview that aired Sunday, said he had \u201cevery right to\u201d interfere with a presidential election, as he faces an updated indictment in the federal election interference case against him.",

        "text": "US election season is about to start; first ballots go out within days\nIt might feel like the presidential election is still a long way off. It's not.\n\nElection Day on November 5 is only about two months away, and major dates, events and political developments will make it fly by. The stretch between now and then will go as fast as summer break from school in most parts of the country.\n\nThe first mail ballots will be sent to voters this Friday. The first presidential debate is set for September 10. Former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, is scheduled to be sentenced in his New York hush money case on September 18. And early in-person voting will start as soon as September 20 in some states.\n\nHere's a look at why the calendar will move quickly, with the Democratic and Republican conventions over and Labor Day signaling the traditional start of campaign season.\n\nWho's ready to vote?\n\nThe first batch of ballots typically sent out are ones to military and overseas voters. Under federal law, that must happen at least 45 days before an election, which this year is September 21.\n\nSome states start earlier. North Carolina will begin sending mail ballots to all voters who request them, including military personnel and overseas voters, on September 6.\n\nVoter registration deadlines vary by state, with most falling between eight and 30 days before the election, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. The deadline is October 7 in Georgia, one of this year's most prominent presidential battlegrounds.\n\nNearly all states offer some version of in-person voting, though the rules and dates vary considerably. In Pennsylvania, another of the major presidential battleground states, voters can visit their local election office to request, complete and return a mail ballot beginning September 16. For those counting, that's a little over two weeks from now.\n\nUpcoming debates\n\nWhether, where and under what rules the Democratic and Republican presidential and vice presidential nominees will debate has been a point of contention for weeks. But for now, two matchups are on the calendar.\n\nTrump and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris have accepted an invitation from ABC News to debate September 10 in Philadelphia.\n\nHarris' pick for vice president, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, and Trump's, Ohio Senator JD Vance, have agreed to an October 1 debate hosted by CBS News in New York City.\n\nHarris has forecast a possible second debate with Trump, but her proposal appeared to be contingent on the Republican nominee's participation in the September 10 debate. Trump has proposed three presidential debates with different television networks.\n\nVance has challenged Walz to another vice presidential debate on September 18, although it's not been set.\n\nPossible criminal sentence for Trump\n\nTrump is scheduled to be sentenced September 18 in his hush money criminal case, though his lawyers have asked the judge to delay the proceeding until after Election Day. A decision is expected early this month.\n\nIn a letter to Judge Juan M. Merchan, Trump's lawyers suggested that holding the sentencing as scheduled, about seven weeks before Election Day, would amount to election interference. On September 16, Merchan is expected to rule on Trump's request to overturn the guilty verdict and dismiss the case because of the U.S. Supreme Court's July presidential immunity ruling.\n\nTrump was convicted in May on 34 counts of falsifying business records to conceal a $130,000 hush money payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels just before the 2016 presidential election. Falsifying business records is punishable by up to four years in prison. Other potential sentences include probation, a fine or a conditional discharge that would require Trump to stay out of trouble to avoid additional punishment.\n\nNext steps in Trump's other New York cases\n\nOn Friday, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will hear arguments in Trump's appeal of a jury's verdict last year ordering him to pay $5 million to writer E. Jean Carroll after it found him liable for sexually assaulting and defaming her. Trump also is appealing a verdict in a second trial in January in which a jury found him liable on additional defamation claims and ordered him to pay Carroll $83.3 million. Trump's lawyers have until September 13 to file a brief in that appeal.\n\nOn September 26, a New York appeals court will hear oral arguments in Trump's challenge of a nearly $500 million civil fraud judgment in state Attorney General Letitia James' lawsuit against him. The court typically rules about a month after arguments, meaning a decision could come before the November election.\n\nTrump's lawyers argue that a judge's February 16 finding that the former president lied for years about his wealth as he built his real estate empire was \"erroneous\" and \"egregious.\" State lawyers responded in court papers this week that there's \"overwhelming evidence\" to support the verdict.\n\nWhat about Trump's election and document cases?\n\nA state case in Georgia that charged Trump and 18 others in a wide-ranging scheme to overturn his 2020 loss in the state is stalled with no chance of going to trial before the election.\n\nFederal prosecutors have brought two criminal cases against Trump, but one was dismissed by a judge last month and the other is likely to be reshaped by the recent U.S. Supreme Court opinion that conferred broad immunity on former presidents for official acts they take in office.\n\nSpecial counsel Jack Smith has appealed the dismissal by U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon of an indictment charging Trump with hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and obstructing the FBI's efforts to get them back. But even if a federal appeals court reinstates the case and reverses the judge's ruling that Smith's appointment was unconstitutional, there's no chance of a trial taking place this year.\n\nConsidering the Supreme Court's immunity ruling, a federal judge in Washington is now tasked with deciding which allegations in a separate case charging Trump with plotting to overturn the 2020 election can remain part of the prosecution and which ones must be discarded. Deciding which acts are official and which are not is likely to be an arduous process.\n\nFights over voting and the election\n\nBefore the first ballots are even cast, both camps are gearing up to fight over voting.\n\nBattles over election rules have become a staple of American democracy, but they're expected to reach new heights this year. Trump installed his own leadership team at the Republican National Committee, including a director of election integrity who helped him try to overturn Biden's win in 2020. The RNC has filed several lawsuits challenging voting rules and promises that more are on the way.\n\nDemocrats also are assembling a legal team. Among other things, they are objecting to Republican efforts to remove some inactive voters or noncitizens from voter rolls, arguing that legal voters will get swept up in the purges.",

        "text": "Republicans are lining up to oppose Trump. Will it make a difference?\nDonald Trump has a knack for rallying a remarkable range of political opinion around a common goal: preventing his return to the White House.\n\nThat now includes prominent names from his own Republican party and top aides who worked under him as president. From former White House officials and national security staff to a once-worshipful press secretary, a host of one-time Trump fans are now lining up to join Democrats in declaring him unfit for another term in office.\n\nWhite House lawyers who served Republican presidents going back to Ronald Reagan and retired senior military officers have also denounced Trump as a danger to democracy.\n\nAdding to Trump\u2019s humiliation, even members of his own cabinet \u2013 who once pledged their fealty with a subservience that would not displease Vladimir Putin \u2013 are declining to endorse him for re-election in November.\n\nIt\u2019s not entirely a one-way street. For his part, Trump has managed to win over Robert F Kennedy Jr, scion of the US\u2019s most renowned Democratic family and erstwhile presidential candidate, and Tulsi Gabbard, a former Democratic member of Congress.\n\nTrump has added the pair to his transition team but the impact of their endorsement was tempered by Democrats swiftly reminding voters that Kennedy once described Trump as \u201ca terrible president\u201d and his policies as \u201cabsurd and terrifying\u201d. Neither will more reasoned Republicans be reassured by Kennedy\u2019s anti-vaxxer views, which have drawn the scorn of at least one major party donor.\n\nThe anti-Trump messages are principally aimed at persuading Republicans who may formerly have voted for him that they should put country before party to keep a dangerous populist from a second term in the White House. Opinion polls say that 9% of likely voters who support Trump are prepared to at least consider switching to the Democratic candidate, Kamala Harris.\n\nIn early August, her campaign launched \u201cRepublicans for Harris\u201d to target voters thought most likely to switch, particularly those who backed Trump\u2019s rival in the primaries, Nikki Haley.\n\nOn Monday, 200 Republicans who worked for President George W Bush and the former presidential candidates Senators Mitt Romney and John McCain, released an open letter in support of Harris and her running mate, the Minnesota governor, Tim Walz.\n\nThe letter warned that there was more to fear from Trump than a repeat of his first term because he is now bound up with the authoritarian plan to impose rightwing control across the entire US government, including non-partisan federal agencies, known as Project 2025.\n\n\u201cOf course, we have plenty of honest, ideological disagreements with Vice President Harris and Gov Walz. That\u2019s to be expected. The alternative, however, is simply untenable,\u201d the letter said.\n\n\u201cAt home, another four years of Donald Trump\u2019s chaotic leadership, this time focused on advancing the dangerous goals of Project 2025, will hurt real, everyday people and weaken our sacred institutions. Abroad, democratic movements will be irreparably jeopardized as Trump and his acolyte JD Vance kowtow to dictators like Vladimir Putin while turning their backs on our allies. We can\u2019t let that happen.\u201d\n\nThe signatories included Jean Becker, President George HW Bush\u2019s chief of staff; David Nierenberg, the campaign finance chair for Romney\u2019s 2012 presidential campaign; and two former chiefs of staff for McCain.\n\nView image in fullscreen The former Trump press secretary Stephanie Grisham speaks at the Democratic national convention in Chicago. Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nThe Trump campaign communications director, Steven Cheung, scorned the letter as written by nonentities.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hilarious because nobody knows who these people are. They would rather see the country burn down than to see President Trump successfully return to the White House to Make America Great Again,\u201d he told Fox News.\n\nBut many Trump supporters will have heard of Stephanie Grisham who served as White House press secretary and routinely appeared on conservative media outlets promoting the then president. Grisham spoke at the Democratic national convention in August where she described how she was once \u201ca true believer\u201d but by the end of Trump\u2019s presidency had concluded that \u201che has no empathy, no morals, and no fidelity to the truth.\n\n\u201cTrump mocks his supporters. He calls them basement dwellers,\u201d she told the DNC and millions of Americans voters watching on television.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Stakes \u2014 Presidential Transition Free newsletter We will guide you through the aftermath of the US election and the transition to a Trump presidency Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Kamala Harris tells the truth. She respects the American people and she has my vote,\u201d she said.\n\nA former member of Congress, Adam Kinzinger, who was one of just 10 Republicans to vote to impeach Trump after the attack on the Capitol, also denounced him from the Democratic convention podium for having \u201csuffocated the soul of the Republican party\u201d.\n\nOther Republicans have joined the criticisms of Trump by saying that it is not enough to stand by and not vote in November.\n\nA dozen former White House lawyers who served Republican presidents from Ronald Reagan to George W Bush backed Harris in a letter warning that returning Trump to office \u201cwould threaten American democracy and undermine the rule of law in our country\u201d. The letter appeals to \u201call patriotic Republicans, former Republicans, conservative and center-right citizens, and independent voters to place love of country above party and ideology\u201d and vote for Harris.\n\n\u201cWe cannot go along with other former Republican officials who have condemned Trump with these devastating judgments but are still not willing to vote for Harris. We believe this election presents a binary choice, and Trump is utterly disqualified,\u201d it said.\n\nThat appears aimed at former officials such as John Bolton, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, and former defense secretary Mark Esper who have both denounced Trump as unfit for office but declined to endorse Harris.\n\nThe letter signed by the 200 former officials said the last presidential election was decided by \u201cmoderate Republicans and conservative independents\u201d in swing states who \u201cput country far before party\u201d to defeat Trump four years ago.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re heartfully calling on these friends, colleagues, neighbors, and family members to take a brave stand once more, to vote for leaders that will strive for consensus, not chaos; that will work to unite, not divide; that will make our country and our children proud. Those leaders are Vice President Kamala Harris and Gov Tim Walz,\u201d it said.\n\nLarry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia\u2019s center for politics, said the appeals by the anti-Trump Republicans are aimed at a narrow slice of the electorate given that he doubts many voters are truly undecided.\n\n\u201cA lot of those undecided are just people who are not going to tell the pollster who they\u2019re voting for. There just aren\u2019t that many undecideds. It\u2019s people\u2019s way of avoiding an argument. Also, I don\u2019t think it changes one Republican\u2019s mind who wasn\u2019t open to the idea of not voting for Trump and there aren\u2019t that many of them,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut it can make a difference for people who pay attention and who are movable. It also makes a difference for Democratic-leaning independents. It justifies the decision to support Harris they\u2019ve already made. For that reason it matters because these are people, many of them, who\u2019ve worked closely with Trump in the White House and they\u2019ve seen up close how incompetent he is and how unsuited he is for the presidency. It\u2019s critical to get these people on the record.\u201d",

This development marks a significant shift in the race, particularly since President Joe Biden \u2019s exit in July. Harris, who has taken over the Democratic ticket, is showing stronger numbers than Biden did, especially in battleground states.Recent polls reflect Harris\u2019 growing momentum. According to an ABC News/Ipsos poll conducted between August 23-27, Harris leads Trump by a narrow margin of 50% to 46% among all adults and registered voters. Among likely voters, her lead widens slightly to 52% against Trump's 46%. The poll also highlights that 56% of Americans rate Harris' campaign performance as \"excellent\" or \"good,\" compared to 41% for Trump.The Wall Street Journal Quinnipiac , and Suffolk/USA Today polls similarly show Harris ahead, with respective percentages of 48%, 49%, and 48%. In contrast, Trump stands at 47%, 48%, and 43% in these polls.Harris is performing particularly well in critical swing states, which could be decisive in determining the election's outcome. The Bloomberg/Morning Consult polls reveal that Harris is leading Trump within the margin of error in Georgia (50%), Michigan (49%), Nevada (50%), and Pennsylvania (51%). She has also pulled ahead outside the margin of error in Wisconsin, with a 53% lead. However, the race is extremely close in Arizona and North Carolina, where both candidates are tied.This performance contrasts sharply with Biden's campaign, where he struggled to make significant inroads in these key states. Harris' ability to secure leads in states like Michigan and Pennsylvania highlights her appeal as a more trusted leader among voters in these areas.Despite Harris' gains, Trump continues to hold strong in areas that are particularly important to voters. He leads Harris on the economy and inflation by 8 points each and has a 9-point advantage on handling the US-Mexico border. These issues are expected to play a critical role as the election nears. As reported by The Wall Street Journal, these areas of strength give Trump a solid base, even as he trails in overall polling numbers.\"Trump maintains advantages in areas critical to voters, leading by 8 points on the economy and inflation, and 9 points on handling the US-Mexico border,\" the poll results show.The shift in polling dynamics since Biden's exit is noteworthy. Before Biden stepped down, he was trailing Trump in several key states, including the Great Lakes swing states and the Sun Belt. Biden's campaign also faced challenges after the June 27 debate, where he failed to gain momentum. Harris, however, appears to be turning the tide, especially among female voters, where she has expanded her lead to 13 points (54% to 41%) from a previous 6-point margin.The polling index by The Hill and Decision Desk HQ also reflects Harris holding a national lead, pegged at 3.8 points over Trump. The ABC News/Ipsos poll, with a margin of sampling error of 2.1 percentage points at a 95% confidence level, underlines the competitive nature of this race.As the 2024 presidential race enters its final stretch, the competition between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump remains tight and highly competitive. Harris' recent gains suggest that she is resonating with key voter demographics, but Trump\u2019s strengths on critical issues like the economy and border security mean the race is far from decided. Both campaigns are likely to ramp up their efforts, making the next few weeks crucial in determining the final outcome.(With inputs from TOI)",

        "text": "Noncitizen voting is extremely rare, yet Republicans are making it a major election concern\nOnly U.S. citizens are eligible to vote in this fall\u2019s election for president and other top offices. While that is nothing new, the potential for noncitizens to register or vote has been receiving a lot of attention lately.\n\nCiting an influx of immigrants in recent years at the U.S.-Mexico border, Republicans have raised concerns about the possibility that noncitizens will be voting and they have taken steps in numerous states to address that prospect, even though cases of noncitizens actually voting are rare.\n\nGOP officials have undertaken reviews of voter rolls, issued executive orders and placed constitutional amendments on state ballots as part of an emphasis on thwarting noncitizen voting. Some Democrats contend the measures could create hurdles for legal voters, are unnecessary and lead people to believe the problem of noncitizens voting is bigger than it really is.\n\nWhat does the law say?\n\nA 1996 U.S. law makes it illegal for noncitizens to vote in elections for president or members of Congress. Violators can be fined and imprisoned for up to a year. They can also be deported.\n\nWhen people register to vote, they confirm under penalty of perjury that they are U.S. citizens. Federal law requires states to regularly maintain their voter rolls and remove anyone who is ineligible, a process that could identify immigrants living in the country illegally.\n\nNo state constitutions explicitly allow noncitizens to vote, and many states have laws that prohibit noncitizens from voting for state offices such as governor or attorney general. But some municipalities in California, Maryland and Vermont, as well as the District of Columbia, do allow voting by noncitizens in some local elections such as for school board and city council.\n\nWhat does the data say?\n\nVoting by noncitizens is rare. Yet Republican officials have highlighted voter registration reviews that turned up potential noncitizens.\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, said this past week that more than 6,500 potential noncitizens have been removed from Texas voter rolls since 2021, including 1,930 with \u201ca voter history\u201d who have been referred for investigation by the attorney general\u2019s office. Texas has almost 18 million registered voters.\n\nWATCH:How the politically diverse Latino community can help moderate U.S. polarization\n\nOhio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Republican, said in August that he referred for potential prosecution 138 apparent noncitizens found to have voted in a recent election and 459 more who registered but did not vote. Those figures were higher than reviews from previous years but a small fraction of the more than 8 million registered voters in Ohio.\n\nAlabama Secretary of State Wes Allen, a Republican, recently announced that 3,251 people previously identified as noncitizens by the federal government are being switched to inactive status on the state\u2019s voter registration rolls. They will be required to provide proof of citizenship and fill out a form to vote in November. Alabama has more than 3 million registered voters.\n\nIn Georgia, Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger found that 1,634 potential noncitizens tried to register to vote between 1997 and 2022, though election officials flagged them and none was registered. Georgia registered millions of other voters during that time.\n\nSome election administration experts have said the voter roll reviews show that current tools to flag noncitizen voters are working.\n\nWhat do the courts say?\n\nArizona provides a case study for the long-running attempts by Republicans to prohibit noncitizen voting.\n\nUnder a 2004 voter-approved initiative, Arizona required a driver\u2019s license, birth certificate, passport or other similar document to approve a federal voter registration application. But the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2013 that Arizona cannot require documentary proof of citizenship for people to vote in federal elections.\n\nThe state responded by creating two classes of voters. For state and local elections, voters must provide proof of citizenship when they register or have it on file with the state. But because that cannot be required in presidential and congressional elections, tens of thousands of voters who have not provided proof of citizenship are registered only for federal elections.\n\nAn August order by a divided U.S. Supreme Court will allow voter registration forms submitted without \u201cdocumentary proof of citizenship\u201d to be rejected by Arizona counties while litigation over the law continues. People will be able to register to vote in presidential and congressional elections using a different federal form that requires people to swear they are citizens under penalty of perjury, without requiring proof.\n\nWhat\u2019s on the ballot?\n\nRepublican-led legislatures in eight states have proposed constitutional amendments on their November ballots declaring that only citizens can vote.\n\nProposals in Iowa, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Wisconsin would replace existing constitutional provisions stating that \u201cevery\u201d citizen or \u201call\u201d citizens can vote with new wording saying \u201conly\u201d citizens can vote. Supporters contend the current wording does not necessarily bar noncitizens from voting.\n\nIn Idaho and Kentucky, the proposed amendments would explicitly state: \u201cNo person who is not a citizen of the United States\u201d can vote. Similar wording won approval from Louisiana voters two years ago.\n\nVoters in North Dakota, Colorado, Alabama, Florida and Ohio passed amendments between 2018 and 2022 restricting voting to \u201conly\u201d citizens.\n\nWhat else are states doing?\n\nAlthough noncitizen voting already is prohibited in the state constitution, Republican Gov. Jeff Landry of Louisiana is continuing to draw attention to the issue. He recently signed an executive order requiring state agencies that provide voter registration forms to include a written disclaimer that noncitizens are prohibited from voting.\n\nIn Georgia, Raffensperger last week required every polling place to post a sign in English and Spanish warning noncitizens that it is illegal to vote.\n\nRepublican Attorney General Ken Paxton of Texas, citing \u201csignificant growth of the noncitizen population\u201d in the state, set up a special email account Wednesday to report suspected violations of election laws.\n\nIn Wisconsin, Republicans have filed a pair of similar lawsuits in recent weeks that challenge the state\u2019s process for verifying whether a registered voter is a citizen. The lawsuits seek court orders requiring the elections commission to perform checks to ensure there are no registered voters who are noncitizens.\n\nNorth Carolina Republicans have sued the state election board, alleging it is not enforcing a new law aimed at removing people from voter rolls who seek jury duty exclusions because they are not citizens.\n\nTennessee\u2019s top election office sent letters in June asking for proof of citizenship from more than 14,000 registered voters, though those who failed to respond will not be barred from voting. The list was based on data from the state Department of Safety and Homeland Security, which has information about whether residents were U.S. citizens when they first interacted with that department.\n\nWhat has Congress done?\n\nRepublicans in Congress are pushing a bill, known as the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act, that would require proof of citizenship to register to vote. During a news conference about the legislation this year, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., did not provide specific examples of noncitizens voting but insisted it is a concern.\n\n\u201cWe all know, intuitively, that a lot of illegals are voting in federal elections,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it\u2019s not been something that is easily provable.\u201d\n\nThe legislation passed the Republican-led House in July largely along partisan lines but has not come to a vote in the Democratic-led Senate. The Biden administration said it is strongly opposed and that laws against noncitizen voting are working.\n\n\u201cThis bill would do nothing to safeguard our elections, but it would make it much harder for all eligible Americans to register to vote and increase the risk that eligible voters are purged from voter rolls,\u201d the White House said in a statement.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Scott Bauer in Madison, Wisconsin, and Ali Swenson in New York contributed to this report.",

Among the most notable missteps are his controversial remarks about \"childless cat ladies,\" his unfounded claims that Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, running mate to Vice President.Kamala Harris, is benefitting from \"stolen valor,\" and a persistent joke about \"couch sex\" that has plagued him on the campaign trail.Additionally, photos allegedly showing Vance in drag during his time as a student at Yale have added to the scrutiny, as per the USA Today report.These controversies have raised concerns within the Republican Party, with some questioning whether Vance is the right choice to stand alongside Trump on the ticket. Despite efforts to shift focus toward core issues that resonate with the GOP base, such as border security, Vance's public missteps have continued to draw attention.Amid the growing uncertainty surrounding Vance, there has been speculation about who might replace him if Trump were to make a change. One potential option was Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who suspended his own presidential campaign in late August and subsequently endorsed Trump.However, Kennedy has since indicated that he has been promised a role within the Trump administration rather than a place on the ticket.Other names that have been floated include Florida Senator Marco Rubio and North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, both of whom were considered by Trump before he ultimately chose Vance. These figures remain part of the pool of potential replacements, though it is unclear if any serious moves are being made in that direction.One significant factor complicating any potential switch is the timing. According to reports, the ballot access deadline for Ohio, Vance's home state, is September 1. This means that Trump would have to decide before Labor Day if he intends to replace Vance. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer highlighted this deadline, adding pressure on the Trump campaign to finalize its decision.Within the Republican Party, there is a mix of concern and confidence about Vance's position on the ticket. Marc Short, former chief of staff to Vice President Mike Pence, noted that Vance must be cautious not to \"lose President Trump's confidence.\" He emphasized that Trump is known for forming opinions quickly, which could increase the risk for Vance if the controversies continue to overshadow the campaign.As the election draws nearer, all eyes will be on Trump to see whether he will stick with his chosen running mate or make a last-minute switch. The coming days will be critical in determining the final composition of the Republican ticket.According to the latest forecast by Decision Desk HQ and The Hill, Vice President Kamala Harris has a 56 percent chance of winning the U.S. presidential election.The 2024 United States presidential election will mark the 60th quadrennial presidential election, scheduled to take place on Tuesday, November 5, 2024.",

(AP) \u2014 After a summer of historic tumult, the path to the presidency for both Kamala Harris and Donald Trump this fall is becoming much clearer.\n\nThe Democratic vice president and the Republican former president will devote almost all of their remaining time and resources to just seven states. They will spend hundreds of millions of dollars targeting voters who, in many cases, have just begun to pay attention to the election. And their campaigns will try to focus their messages on three familiar issues \u2014 the economy, immigration and abortion \u2014 even in the midst of heated debates over character, culture and democracy.\n\nThe candidates will debate in one week in what will be their first meeting ever. The nation\u2019s premier swing state, Pennsylvania, begins in-person absentee voting the week after. By the end of the month, early voting will be underway in at least four states with a dozen more to follow by mid-October.\n\nIn just 63 days, the final votes will be cast to decide which one of them will lead the world\u2019s most powerful nation.\n\nPrivately, at least, both camps acknowledge that victory is no sure thing as they begin the nine-week sprint to Election Day. Harris and Trump are neck-and-neck in most national polls conducted since President Joe Biden ended his reelection campaign.\n\nThe Harris campaign still put out a memo over the weekend casting itself as \u201cthe clear underdogs\u201d in the contest.\n\nWhat to know about Trump\u2019s second term:\n\nStaffing the administration: Here are the people Trump has picked recess appointments Follow all of our coverage as Donald Trump assembles his second administration.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a scenario here that\u2019s easy,\u201d Harris senior adviser David Plouffe said in an interview. \u201cThe pathway to beating Donald Trump, the pathway to 270 electoral votes for Kamala Harris, is exceedingly hard, but doable. And that\u2019s just a reality.\u201d\n\nTrump, meanwhile, rejects any indicators that suggest Harris is ahead even as he lashes out at her in deeply personal and sometimes apocalyptic terms, declaring that \u201cour country is finished\u201d if she wins.\n\n\u201cAs we move past Labor Day, we will really get into the time where voters start to harden their opinions,\u201d said James Blair, the Trump campaign\u2019s political director. \u201cWe feel pretty good about things. We feel energized. Our people are energized. But there\u2019s certainly plenty of work to be done.\u201d\n\nThe electoral map settles on seven states\n\nJust over a month ago, Trump allies suggested Democratic-leaning states like Minnesota, Virginia or even New Jersey might be in play. Neither side believes that is still the case on Labor Day weekend.\n\nIn replacing Biden as the party\u2019s nominee, Harris breathed new life into the Democrats\u2019 political prospects, especially across the Sun Belt states of Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina. All four states have significant numbers of African Americans and Latinos, traditionally Democratic constituencies who were down nationally on Biden but appear to have come home to rally behind Harris.\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham was among the senior GOP officials who brokered a peace between Trump and Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, whose feud threatened to undermine the Republican effort in the state. Graham told The Associated Press he was worried about Georgia\u2019s shift leftward.\n\n\u201cTrump was up 5 or 6 points, and all over the course of a month it\u2019s become much more competitive,\u201d he said.\n\nRepublican pollster Paul Shumaker, an adviser to North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis, said even a slight uptick in the Black vote has the potential to give Harris the edge in North Carolina, pointing to Mecklenburg County, the home of the Charlotte metro area, but also fast-growing counties such as Durham and Wake.\n\n\u201cIf Kamala Harris could get them to turn out at the rate of Republicans in rural North Carolina, game over for Republicans,\u201d Shumaker said of Black voters.\n\nAt the same time, Trump remains decidedly on offense in the Midwestern battlegrounds of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, which form the so-called Democratic \u201cblue wall\u201d that he narrowly carried in 2016 and barely lost in 2020.\n\nThose seven states \u2014 in addition to swing districts in Nebraska and Maine that each award single Electoral College votes \u2014 will draw virtually all of the candidates\u2019 attention and resources over the next nine weeks.\n\nTrump is investing more advertising dollars in Pennsylvania than any other state through Election Day.\n\nA Trump victory in Pennsylvania alone would make it much more difficult for Harris to earn the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency. Harris\u2019 team insists she has multiple pathways to victory.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 organizing advantage\n\nIn the fight to frame the election on the air and reach voters in person, Democrats currently have a decided advantage.\n\nHarris\u2019 team is on pace to outspend Trump\u2019s camp 2-to-1 in television advertising over the next two months. And even before Biden made way for Harris, the Democrats wielded superior campaign infrastructure in the states that matter most.\n\nHarris\u2019 team, which includes her campaign and an allied super PAC, have more than $280 million in television and radio reservations for the period between Tuesday and Election Day, according to the media tracking firm AdImpact. Trump\u2019s team, by contrast, has $133 million reserved for the final stretch, although that number is expected to grow.\n\nTrump\u2019s side is actually narrowly outspending Harris\u2019 on the airwaves in Pennsylvania, where both sides will spend more than $146 million between Tuesday and Election Day, according to AdImpact, a figure that dwarfs that of any other state. Georgia is drawing nearly $80 million in ad spending over the campaign\u2019s final nine weeks.\n\nBut in the other five battleground states, Harris largely has the airwaves largely to herself \u2014 at least for now.\n\nTrump and his allied super PACs have made only marginal ad reservations in Michigan, Arizona, Wisconsin, North Carolina and Nevada to date. Harris\u2019 team, by comparison, is investing no less than $21 million in each of the five states, according to an AdImpact analysis.\n\nHarris\u2019 team also boasts more than 300 coordinated offices and 2,000 staff on the ground in swing states, according to her campaign\u2019s weekend memo.\n\nBlair, the Trump campaign\u2019s political director, disputes that Democrats have as big an organizing advantage as those numbers make it seem. He pointed to outside allies that will organize for Trump are well-funded, including a new effort backed by billionaire Elon Musk.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign on Tuesday said it also has more than 100 dedicated campaign offices in key states, which are backed by another 200 existing GOP offices dedicated to Republican victories this fall.\n\nHere\u2019s what the polls say\n\nBoth candidates are locked in close races across the seven top swing states. Democratic pollster John Anzalone said Harris \u201cput the Democrats back in the game to where it\u2019s kind of a toss-up.\u201d\n\nBut now comes the hard part, Anzalone said.\n\n\u201cPost Labor Day, when the bell rings, there is a battle for a slim universe of \u2014 you can call them anything you want: persuasion voters, swing voters, independent voters \u2014 and it\u2019s pretty small, and that\u2019s where each side gets a billion dollars,\u201d Anzalone said.\n\nMany independents appear to find both candidates unsatisfying, according to an AP-NORC poll conducted in August.\n\nFor now, Harris also has a slight advantage on some key traits among independents, while she and Trump are about even on others.\n\nFor example, about 3 in 10 independents say that \u201chonest\u201d describes Harris better, while about 2 in 10 say it describes Trump better. About 3 in 10 also say that \u201ccommitted to democracy\u201d describes Harris better, while less than 2 in 10 say it describes Trump better.\n\nThe candidates were about equally likely to be perceived by independents as capable of winning the election, capable of handling a crisis, and \u201ccaring about people like you.\u201d\n\nWho is the \u2018change candidate\u2019?\n\nThe race may ultimately be decided by whichever candidate can most successfully be cast as the \u201cchange candidate\u201d given that about 7 in 10 voters say the country is heading in the wrong direction, based on an AP-NORC poll conducted in late July after Biden withdrew from the race.\n\nTrump was the face of change when he won the 2016 election. And even after serving in the White House for four years, he continues to energize millions of frustrated voters who embrace his brash leadership style and unwillingness to follow the traditional rules of politics.\n\nHarris has been Biden\u2019s vice president for nearly four years, yet the historic nature of her candidacy \u2014 she would be the first woman president \u2014 allows her to make a convincing case that she represents a new direction for the country, said veteran Democratic strategist James Carville.\n\nStill, he\u2019s worried about his party\u2019s \u201csevere underperformance\u201d in the so-called \u201cblue wall\u201d states in recent elections.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll feel good after the election,\u201d Carville said. \u201cLet\u2019s get the hay in the barn. There\u2019s still a lot of hay out there in the field.\u201d\n\n___\n\nPeoples reported from New York and Thomson-DeVeaux from Washington.

First ballots available within days\nWhat to Know Election Day on Nov. 5 is only about two months away, and major dates, events and political developments will make it fly by.\n\nThe first mail ballots will start going out to voters on Friday. The first presidential debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump is set for Sept. 10.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, counties are allowed to begin processing mail ballot applications up to 50 days before the election, or Sept. 16 this year, unless a county decides to do it earlier. But counties do not yet have a certified ballot from the state because there are three third-party ballot-access challenges pending in the state Supreme Court.\n\nIt might feel like the presidential election is still a long way off. It\u2019s not.\n\nElection Day on Nov. 5 is only about two months away, and major dates, events and political developments will make it fly by. The stretch between now and then will go as fast as summer break from school in most parts of the country.\n\nThe first mail ballots will be sent to voters this Friday. The first presidential debate is set for Sept. 10. Former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, is scheduled to be sentenced in his New York hush money case on Sept. 18. And early in-person voting will start as soon as Sept. 20 in some states.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nL\u00e9elo en espa\u00f1ol aqu\u00ed.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at why the calendar will move quickly, with the Democratic and Republican conventions over and Labor Day signaling the traditional start of campaign season.\n\nWho's ready to vote (including in Pennsylvania)?\n\nThe first batch of ballots typically sent out are ones to military and overseas voters. Under federal law, that must happen at least 45 days before an election \u2014 which this year is Sept. 21.\n\nSome states start earlier.\n\nElection offices in North Carolina are scheduled to begin sending mail ballots to all voters who request them on Friday. That could be delayed because presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has sued to have his name removed from the state's ballot after he suspended his campaign.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, counties are allowed to begin processing mail ballot applications up to 50 days before the election, or Sept. 16 this year, unless a county decides to do it earlier. But counties do not yet have a certified ballot from the state because there are three third-party ballot-access challenges pending in the state Supreme Court. After certification, counties will need time to print and test the ballot, leading some county officials to caution that they might not go out until late September or early October. Kennedy has successfully withdrawn from the ballot in Pennsylvania.\n\nVoter registration deadlines vary by state, with most falling between eight and 30 days before the election, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. The deadline is Oct. 7 in Georgia, one of this year\u2019s most prominent presidential battlegrounds.\n\nNearly all states offer some version of in-person voting, though the rules and dates vary considerably.\n\nThe gloves come off\n\nWhether, where and under what rules the Democratic and Republican presidential and vice presidential nominees will debate has been a point of contention for weeks. But for now, two match-ups are on the calendar.\n\nTrump and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris have accepted an invitation from ABC News to debate Sept. 10 in Philadelphia.\n\nHarris' pick for vice president, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, and Trump's, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, have agreed to an Oct. 1 debate hosted by CBS News in New York City.\n\nHarris has forecast a possible second debate with Trump, but her proposal appeared to be contingent on the GOP nominee\u2019s participation in the Sept. 10 debate. Trump has proposed three presidential debates with different television networks.\n\nVance has challenged Walz to another vice presidential debate on Sept. 18, although it's not been set.\n\nA possible criminal sentence for former President Donald Trump\n\nTrump is scheduled to be sentenced Sept. 18 in his hush money criminal case, though his lawyers have asked the judge to delay the proceeding until after Election Day. A decision is expected early this month.\n\nIn a letter to Judge Juan M. Merchan, Trump\u2019s lawyers suggested that holding the sentencing as scheduled, about seven weeks before Election Day, would amount to election interference. On Sept. 16, Merchan is expected to rule on Trump\u2019s request to overturn the guilty verdict and dismiss the case because of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s July presidential immunity ruling.\n\nTrump was convicted in May on 34 counts of falsifying business records to conceal a $130,000 hush money payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels just before the 2016 presidential election. Falsifying business records is punishable by up to four years in prison. Other potential sentences include probation, a fine or a conditional discharge that would require Trump to stay out of trouble to avoid additional punishment.\n\nNext steps in Trump's other New York cases\n\nOn Friday, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will hear arguments in Trump\u2019s appeal of a jury\u2019s verdict last year ordering him to pay $5 million to writer E. Jean Carroll after it found him liable for sexually assaulting and defaming her. Trump also is appealing a verdict in a second trial in January in which a jury found him liable on additional defamation claims and ordered him to pay Carroll $83.3 million. Trump\u2019s lawyers have until Sept. 13 to file a brief in that appeal.\n\nOn Sept. 26, a New York appeals court will hear oral arguments in Trump\u2019s challenge of a nearly $500 million civil fraud judgment in state Attorney General Letitia James\u2019 lawsuit against him. The court typically rules about a month after arguments, meaning a decision could come before the November election. Trump\u2019s lawyers argue that a judge\u2019s Feb. 16 finding that the former president lied for years about his wealth as he built his real estate empire was \u201cerroneous\u201d and \u201cegregious.\u201d State lawyers responded in court papers this week that there\u2019s \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d to support the verdict.\n\nWhat about Trump's election and document cases?\n\nA state case in Georgia that charged Trump and 18 others in a wide-ranging scheme to overturn his 2020 loss in the state is stalled with no chance of going to trial before the election.\n\nFederal prosecutors have brought two criminal cases against Trump, but one was dismissed by a judge last month and the other is likely to be reshaped by the recent U.S. Supreme Court opinion that conferred broad immunity on former presidents for official acts they take in office.\n\nSpecial counsel Jack Smith has appealed the dismissal by U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon of an indictment charging Trump with hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and obstructing the FBI\u2019s efforts to get them back. But even if a federal appeals court reinstates the case and reverses the judge\u2019s ruling that Smith\u2019s appointment was unconstitutional, there\u2019s no chance of a trial taking place this year.\n\nIn light of the Supreme Court's immunity ruling, a federal judge in Washington is now tasked with deciding which allegations in a separate case charging Trump with plotting to overturn the 2020 election can remain part of the prosecution and which ones must be discarded. Deciding which acts are official and which are not is likely to be an arduous process.\n\nFights over voting and the election\n\nBefore the first ballots are even cast, both camps are gearing up to fight over voting.\n\nBattles over election rules have become a staple of American democracy, but they're expected to reach new heights this year. Trump installed his own leadership team at the Republican National Committee, including a director of election integrity who helped him try to overturn Biden\u2019s win in 2020. The RNC has filed a blizzard of lawsuits challenging voting rules and promises that more are on the way.\n\nDemocrats also are mobilizing and assembling a robust legal team. Among other things, they are objecting to GOP efforts to remove some inactive voters or noncitizens from voter rolls, arguing that legal voters will get swept up in the purges.\n\nRepublicans have particularly escalated their rhetoric over the specter of noncitizens voting, even though repeated investigations have shown it almost never happens. Some also are pushing to give local election boards the ability to refuse to certify election results.\n\nAll indications are these efforts are laying the groundwork for Trump to again claim the election was stolen from him if he loses and to try to overturn the will of the voters. But there\u2019s no way to know if that will happen until the ballots are cast.\n\nAssociated Press writers Kate Brumback and Christina A.

        "text": "Native American Issues Need to Be Part of Presidential Election Discussions\nNative American Issues Need to Be Part of Presidential Election Discussions\n\nTags\n\nDetails By Levi Rickert September 03, 2024\n\nOpinion. Last week, three tribal leaders penned an open letter to presidential candidates, debate moderators, consultants, political commentators, and the media to push for Native American rights to be part of the upcoming presidential debate on Sept. 10 in Philadelphia and the vice presidential debate on Oct. 1 in New York City.\n\nTribal leaders Coquille Indian Tribe Chair Brenda Meade; Tunica-Biloxi Tribe of Louisiana Chairman Marshall Pierite; and Confederated Tribes of Coos, Lower Umpqua and Siuslaw Indians Chair Brad Kneaper wrote that millions of Americans are tribal citizens who grapple with centuries of disastrous policies designed to stamp out our people and way of life.\n\nNever miss Indian Country\u2019s biggest stories and breaking news. Sign up to get our reporting sent straight to your inbox every weekday morning.\n\n\u201cWe are part of the fabric of America, but the fight for recognition and respect is ongoing, with new battles for tribal sovereignty playing out in the Supreme Court, in Congress, and in statehouses around the country,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWe are teachers, doctors, lawyers, and business owners. We have soared high in government and are governors, cabinet secretaries, and members of Congress. We have families whose futures we must protect.\u201d\n\nThe letter cites tribal sovereignty \u2014 which affords a unique government-to-government relationship between tribal nations and the United States government \u2014 and emphasizes the need for presidents to understand Native American issues.\n\nAmerican Indian and Alaska Native issues should not be an afterthought to national issues for presidential candidates.\n\nThe letter asks that the candidates address the following four issues on the debate stage:\n\nHow they will respect and uphold congressional acts and treaties\n\nHow they will prevent disruptive lobbying and political influence from restricting the rights of Indian Country\n\nHow the federal government will work with tribal leaders to meet critical needs in health, elder care, education and housing\n\nHow they will protect natural resources and tribal lands for generations to come\n\nIn polls conducted by Native News Online, the most important issues among Native Americans are the protection of sacred sites, tribal water settlement rights, tribal sovereignty, Missing and Murdered Indigenous Relatives (MMIR), and health equity.\n\nPolling shows other areas of concern among Native Americans are the economy, social security and the environment.\n\nWe know that the Native vote matters. There are at least seven states, including Arizona, North Carolina, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, and Wisconsin where the Native vote can be the tipping point in the presidential election.\n\nNative Americans are not the only racial or ethnic group concerned about the lack of representation on the debate stage.\n\nLast week, Native News Online published an op-ed written by the National Association of Hispanic Journalists that expressed concern about the lack of journalists of color moderating the presidential debates this year.\n\n\u201cHaving a variety of backgrounds represented results in higher-quality journalism. The perspectives and experiences of journalists of color can ensure they pose questions that resonate with broader audiences. Instead, network and cable news networks are implicitly signaling that when the stakes are highest, white journalists are most likely to get the call,\u201d the National Association of Hispanic Journalists said.\n\n\u201cJournalists of color don\u2019t just pose good questions, they model participation in democracy for millions of young people who see them on the screen, people whose votes the candidates are working to earn. Asians and Latinos are the fastest-growing ethnic groups in America,\u201d the op-ed continues.\n\nTo be fair, on September 10, ABC\u2019s Linsey Davis, who is Black, will co-moderate the debate with fellow ABC anchor David Muir.\n\nBut, it is not enough. The profile of the American population is changing. By 2050, the demographics of the United States will have shifted to people of color being the majority. Currently, 58.9 percent of the country is white and not Hispanic. By 2050, whites will be in the minority.\n\nCiting these numbers is not race-baiting, but simply a statement of fact.\n\nIt is time for people of color to have a voice in the democratic election system of this country. Certainly, the presidential debates are part of the process.\n\nThay\u00e9k gde nw\u00e9nd\u00ebmen - We are all related.\n\nMore Stories Like This\n\nSupport Independent Indigenous Journalism That Holds Power to Account With the election now decided, Native News Online is recommitting to our core mission: rigorous oversight of federal Indian policy and its impact on tribal communities. The previous Trump administration\u2019s record on Indian Country \u2014 from the reduction of sacred sites to aggressive energy development on tribal lands \u2014 demands heightened vigilance as we enter this new term. Our Indigenous-centered newsroom will provide unflinching coverage of policies affecting tribal sovereignty, sacred site protection, MMIR issues, water rights, Indian health, and economic sovereignty.

        "text": "Stop stressing about the polls. Watch these four indicators in the election\nStop stressing about the polls. Watch these four indicators in the election\n\ntoggle caption Justin Merriman/Getty Images\n\nFor the first time in two months, the presidential election is actually set.\n\nThere are sure to be lots more surprises \u2014 and nail biting \u2014 to come, though.\n\nHere are five themes and questions to think about for this fall:\n\n\n\n1. Don\u2019t stress about the polls\n\nThis is the time of year when people who already know who they are going to vote for begin to get nervous and start becoming amateur horse-race poll watchers.\n\nStop it.\n\nSurvey research exists, and it\u2019s largely pretty good. NPR keeps an eye on it and even conducts our own to get a better sense of how people are feeling about the candidates, policy, politics and society. But what all the polls show are two things:\n\n\n\nSponsor Message\n\nVice President Harris is performing better than President Biden was just before he dropped out of the race. She\u2019s gained on average anywhere from 4 to 6 points in swing-state polls, boosting her in the big seven swing states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania (in the so-called Blue Wall), and has drawn support even in the Sun Belt states of North Carolina and Georgia in the East and Arizona and Nevada out West.\n\nThe race is very close, and that\u2019s not likely going to change.\n\nThat\u2019s all, for now, that anyone needs to know about the candidates\u2019 standing in the polls. No one knows exactly who is going to show up, the polls you see aren\u2019t meant to be predictive, and they all have margins of error of about 3 to 4 points, meaning results could actually be about 3 or more points lower or higher.\n\nThat\u2019s a 7-to-8-point potential swing in good surveys, so if things are this close, realize that the game isn\u2019t played on your computer screen looking at polling aggregator sites or reading data geeks\u2019 interpretations of the crosstabs. It\u2019s about activism, mobilization, and, frankly, how Harris performs \u2014 because views of former President Donald Trump are pretty locked in.\n\n\n\nSponsor Message\n\n2. Does Harris continue her momentum and hold steady, or does something change the dynamic?\n\ntoggle caption Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nThe Democratic convention is over and, with it, Harris\u2019 acceptance speech. That address is a pillar moment in any presidential campaign.\n\nHarris then passed a key, basic test last Thursday with her first interview since getting into the race five weeks ago. So far, she\u2019s had about as good a rollout as she could have hoped for. Until the interview with CNN\u2019s Dana Bash, though, almost everything she had done was highly scripted.\n\nNow that the introductory period is over, there is going to likely be increased scrutiny on Harris\u2019 record and policy proposals. The next big test will be the Sept. 10 debate with Trump. Part of her task in the next two months is to keep her base intact and fired up \u2014 and to target the middle. So far, she\u2019s done that.\n\nRepublicans have been critical of positions Harris has taken in this campaign that are at odds with her presidential campaign in 2019, when she was trying to win over progressives on things like fracking, immigration and more. She has to figure out the best ways to explain her change, which she started to do in her interview Thursday. We\u2019ll see how crisp she is in talking about them at the debate.\n\nWill any of those attacks stick? That will be clearer a couple of weeks after the debate when views settle again. But they\u2019d have a better chance of landing with voters if she weren\u2019t running against Trump, who has been all over the map on multiple issues.\n\n\n\n3. Who does best in the debate(s)?\n\nThe first debate will likely be a pretty big audience, likely one of the largest of the campaign, and perhaps very consequential. Consider that the debate between Trump and Biden effectively ended Biden\u2019s candidacy for reelection.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nWhile the debate brings increased scrutiny on Harris\u2019 policy positions and her proposals, it also presents considerable risk to Trump.\n\nTrump, in that first debate against Biden, meandered and told a raft of lies . But Biden\u2019s poor performance overshadowed all that, and Trump largely escaped scrutiny.\n\nAt Trump\u2019s press conference in early August, NPR found 162 lies or distortions in 64 minutes , more than two a minute. Harris, on the other hand, made a dozen statements during her 40-minute Democratic convention acceptance speech that were either misleading or lacking in context.\n\nIf Harris has a solid debate, the focus could be on Trump in a way he doesn\u2019t want.\n\n\n\n4. Who has the better turnout operation?\n\nThe campaigns have spent more than $1 billion on ads already and have knocked on millions of doors to talk with people about who they might prefer and trying to convince them to vote for their candidate.\n\nBut now, after Labor Day, is when it becomes all about mobilization. Early voting begins in a few weeks, and the campaigns will be urging their most reliable voters to go vote early to bank their support. Then, they will shift to targeting their moderately reliable voters and ones maybe leaning in their direction to try to get them to cast their ballots up until Election Day.\n\nDemocrats feel like they have an advantage over the Trump team because some of the GOP turnout effort is being outsourced to Turning Point USA , a group with very limited experience or success in doing this. Turning Point\u2019s tactics have had some professional Republicans operatives irritated and nervous.\n\n\n\n5. What issues motivate voters \u2014 or do they, at the end of the day?\n\nWill views of the economy improve? Do abortion rights drive Democrats to the polls? Will immigration and crime break through for Republicans in the suburbs?\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThese are all valid and important questions, but some wonder how much policy will actually matter, considering this is a race involving Trump, who is such a polarizing figure.\n\nAs Biden likes to say, \u201cDon\u2019t compare me to the Almighty, compare me to the alternative.\u201d That\u2019s certainly true in U.S. politics, which largely presents binary choices.\n\nFor as much as Trump ran as an outsider in the 2016 campaign, he\u2019s now been on the political scene for almost a decade, and he\u2019s 78 years old.\n\nThis election will likely come down to this:\n\nWhether Republicans are able to home in on their advantages on the economy and immigration, or whether Harris can fire up voters angry with Trump over abortion and democracy and truly grab the mantle of change, despite being a sitting vice president.\n\n\u201cWhat we don't know about this election is whether any of these issues really matter,\u201d said Jamal Simmons, a Democratic strategist who worked in the White House for Harris for a year. \u201cWhat might be true is that this is really an election about change versus more of the same. And if it's a change election, Harris is the candidate of change, and it's going to be hard to get people to move off of that.\u201d",

I\u2019d be surprised if Trump doesn\u2019t try to foment insurrection if he loses the election.\u201d\n\nTwin drives by Trump and Maga allies echo some falsehoods from 2020 about fraud due to voting machines and drop boxes, but now promote Trump\u2019s conspiratorial attacks on federal and state prosecutors who filed criminal charges against him for trying to subvert his loss in 2020, and push baseless claims that noncitizens are poised to vote in large numbers.\n\nTurning Point USA, for instance, has touted a multi-million dollar drive to get out more votes for Trump in key swing states, while holding a few big rallies for Trump where bogus claims are still being made that the 2020 election was rigged, and new fears are being raised about potential fraud this year.\n\nTrump and his Maga allies have spent months decrying \u201celection interference\u201d and \u201clawfare\u201d to sully federal and state charges he faces over his multiple and aggressive efforts to block Joe Biden from taking office on 6 January 2021, a tactic that aims both to rally his backers and undercuts the rule of law, experts say.\n\nFurther, as in the 2020 and 2016 elections, Trump has waffled about committing in advance to accept the results of this year\u2019s elections as he did in his June debate with president Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s a fair and legal and good election \u2013 absolutely,\u201d Trump said after being asked three times if he would accept the results. But then Trump repeated a false claim that US elections are filled with fraud to justify his sprawling efforts to overturn his 2020 defeat. \u201cI would have much rather accepted these \u2013 but the fraud and everything else was ridiculous.\u201d\n\nThis year too false charges of sizable voting by noncitizens have become commonplace in the Maga ecosystem. They are spurred in part by Trump and House speaker Mike Johnson holding a press event at Mar-a-Lago in April on the topic that led the House to pass bill to outlaw voting by non-citizens \u2013 even though it is already illegal and historically has been miniscule.\n\nTo drum up fears of noncitizen voting, True the Vote sent out a fundraising appeal in March that cited the group\u2019s efforts to \u201cdraft arguments for litigation\u201d and other plans to thwart what it baselessly claims will be election \u201cchaos\u201d this year \u201cby way of mass illegal voter registrations\u201d.\n\nElection experts and Republican veterans warn that such efforts by Trump and his Maga allies are harbingers for claiming the election is rigged if Trump loses.\n\n\u201cTrump continues to encourage his supporters like Charlie Kirk of Turning Point USA to question the integrity of our elections,\u201d ex-Republican congressman Dave Trott of Michigan said. \u201cHe has no evidence or basis for claiming fraud and is only perpetuating these lies so he has a plan B to disrupt democracy in the event he loses.\u201d\n\nOther critics and experts concur.\n\n\u201cA lot of false claims are masquerading as efforts to change policy to improve election integrity when in actuality they\u2019re just designed to sow distrust in our system if Trump loses,\u201d said David Becker, who leads the Center for Election Innovation & Research. \u201cThis is all designed to manufacture claims that if Trump loses, the election was stolen and to sow discord, chaos and potential violence.\u201d\n\nOn another election front, Trump has also attacked Harris baselessly for spearheading a \u201cvicious, violent overthrow\u201d of Biden to replace him as the party\u2019s nominee, and insinuated that Harris and Biden intentionally failed to provide proper security for his rallies that spurred the assassination attempt against Trump.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Stakes \u2014 Presidential Transition Free newsletter We will guide you through the aftermath of the US election and the transition to a Trump presidency Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At the rally, Trump also vowed to make the election \u201ctoo big to rig\u201d.\n\nLikewise, Turning Point (TP) Action has expanded its role in trying to appeal to Christian nationalist voters which Kirk has made a priority to help Trump. TP Action in July hosted a \u201cBelievers Summit\u201d in Florida that Trump spoke at where he raised more concerns about his fealty to election integrity by urging in enigmatic terms: \u201cChristians, get out and vote, Just this time \u2026 You won\u2019t have to do it anymore.\u201d\n\nWhile TP Action has a mediocre record in recent general elections backing hard-right candidates like election denialist Kari Lake, who lost her race for governor in 2022 and claimed fraud afterwards; but the group flexed its muscles in a Republican primary in July that knocked off Stephen Richer, the top election official in Maricopa county, who rejected election denialist charges in 2020 and 2022.\n\nAlthough they lack the resources of Kirk\u2019s well funded operations, Texas-based True the Vote has long played a role in pushing election conspiracies about voting fraud at drop boxes and other bogus charges, and the group is once more working to sow doubt in Wisconsin.\n\nCatherine Engelbrecht, who founded True the Vote in 2009, in an interview on 30 July with Christian nationalist and self-styled prophet Lance Wallnau, said her group was partnering with a few sheriffs in Wisconsin to monitor drop boxes for voting fraud using camera equipment that the group plans to provide.\n\nTrue the Vote\u2019s game plan for watching drop boxes has echoes of one that it mounted in 2020 when it helped fund rightwing provocateur Dinesh D\u2019Souza make the film 2,000 mules about alleged cheating at drop boxes that was widely discredited.\n\nEngelbrecht also has boasted of plans to use a new app that she has said is being deployed by 7,000 people to help clean up allegedly bloated voter rolls in several states, a ploy that some election officials and experts have faulted for its inaccuracies, according to a July CNN report. Becker told CNN that \u201cvoter lists are more accurate than they have ever been\u201d because of data sharing tools.\n\nRepublican veterans say the actions and rhetoric of Trump and his Maga allies are aimed at fomenting doubts again about the safety of the election system which they will exploit if Trump loses in November.\n\nGiven Trump\u2019s unending false claims about 2020 election fraud, ex-Republican congressman Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania told the Guardian that if Trump loses, \u201cI expect he will do the same thing in 2024. If he loses he will raise Cain in state capitals and he will descend on state capitals with his allies to make the case for fraud.\u201d",

        "text": "The 2024 elections: gender and reproductive rights\nVoters across the United States are witnessing a historic presidential campaign as Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris and Republican former President Donald Trump take the national stage.\n\nThe presidential nominees are scheduled to debate each other for the first time on Tuesday, Sept. 10, 6 p.m. Pacific time. The debate will be hosted by ABC News at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia.\n\nHarris aspires to become the first female president. That, combined with the Supreme Court\u2019s historic overturning of Roe v. Wade, has led gender and reproductive rights to be a focus of the presidential campaign. The issue was heightened when a 2021 interview by Republican vice-presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance resurfaced. In the interview, Vance said the United States government should invest greater time and resources in people with children because \u201cthose are the people who ultimately have a more direct stake in the future of this country.\u201d He stated further, \u201cthe U.S. is run by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made\u2026 you look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC \u2014 the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children.\u201d\n\nWe asked three UC Riverside experts to weigh in on campaign issues of gender, based on their academic research: Kim Y. Dionne, associate professor of political science; Jade Sasser, associate professor of gender and sexuality studies; and Katja M. Guenther, professor of gender and sexuality studies.\n\nQ: How can VP Harris contrast herself against Trump? What strengths do you see in Harris that can mobilize the country?\n\n\n\nA: I\u2019m not sure Harris needs to do much work in differentiating herself from Trump \u2014 they are very distinct candidates in terms of their personal and professional backgrounds, the way they navigate politics, and perhaps most importantly for voters, in the policies they support. For example, while Trump and his party support further restrictions on women's reproductive rights, Harris has been outspoken in supporting abortion rights and protecting women's reproductive freedoms. Marquette University political scientist Julia Azari attended Harris's campaign launch event in Wisconsin and noted how reproductive rights were a significant theme in Harris\u2019s speech and that resonated with the people at the event. Given high public support for legal abortion (Pew Research Center says 63% of Americans support legal abortion), Harris's consistent messaging on protecting reproductive rights could be powerful in mobilizing a majority of Americans.\n\nQ: What do people need to understand when they hear Harris is a \u201chistoric first\u201d?\n\n\n\nA: There are already quite a few comparisons of Kamala Harris to other \u201chistoric first\u201d presidential candidates \u2014 Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and Shirley Chisholm. But it\u2019s important to also remember how Harris is distinct. I recommend folks read a recent post published in a blog I edit (Good Authority) that was written by a team of political scientists that specialize in Black Politics. They describe the ways Harris is different, pointing out how she\u2019ll be navigating in uncharted territory during this campaign. I also recommend reading and following the work of Danielle Lemi, who earned her Ph.D. in political science at UCR. She is an expert on the politics of multiracial candidates like Kamala Harris.\n\nQ: You\u2019ve conducted research on cat caretakers. What has your research revealed?\n\n\n\nA: My research examines how and why people in the Los Angeles area build relationships with and care for community cats, or free-roaming outdoor cats who don\u2019t have a clear human guardian, who number in the hundreds of thousands in LA. Probably because community cats are more prevalent in poorer neighborhoods, their human caregivers are mostly lower-income women, and a high proportion of them are women of color and immigrants to the United States who feel a shared sense of struggle with the cats. In contrast to the stereotype of the \u201ccrazy cat lady,\u201d who is usually depicted as a single, childfree woman who is mentally unwell and isolated from the human community around her, the women in my research\u2014some of whom care for a dozen cats and some of whom care for hundreds every day\u2014are married and have children at the same rate as women in the U.S. population as a whole, appear to be fully mentally competent, have many active social relationships, and are often cornerstones in their communities. As I analyze in a chapter in my new co-edited collection, When Animals Die: Examining Justifications and Envisioning Justice, they also really value reproductive justice, which for community cats means ensuring the cats have access to sterilization until (or if) humans create livable lives for these animals\u2014that is, safe, secure, stable environments for community cats.\n\nQ: Based on your research, there are deeper societal and historical roots to calling a woman a \u201ccat lady.\u201d Can you elaborate on this?\n\n\n\nA: Cats have been associated with women\u2019s power for millennia, as well as with devils and evil spirits. Women who defied community expectations for their behavior have long been ostracized and hunted as witches, and cats, with their independent spirits, noisy and often promiscuous copulation, and eyes that can seem to glow in the dark were connected to evil, so-called black magic, and witches. Across witch hunts at many different time points\u2014Europe in the Middle Ages, Salem, Massachusetts in the 1600s, Lagos, Nigeria today, among others\u2014just being in the company of cats can be used as evidence that a woman is a witch. In spite of their widespread domestication and presence as companion animals, cats are still haunted by their history as animals often involved in moral and religious panics. Globally, witch hunts\u2014which continue to be carried out in a range of countries, including in India, Papua New Guinea, and several countries in western and sub-Saharan Africa, among others\u2014disproportionately target women, and especially those who have in some way violated local community norms, whether those are based in Christian or traditional religious beliefs. Social conditions always shape if and how anti-witch sentiment is expressed. In the substantially secular contemporary United States, we no longer hunt witches, but we do stigmatize their descendants, the \u201ccrazy cat lady,\u201d who, like her witchy ancestors, is a woman who defies social conventions by being too independent, too smart, and too connected to cats for a male-dominated society to feel comfortable. A common cultural representation of the \u201ccrazy cat lady\u201d as a hoarder also provides us with a wonderful foil that lets us draw on century-old ancient ideas about women and cats while pulling our attention away from the real hoarders in a capitalist system: those who hoard money and other resources, including farmed animals.\n\nQ: What does name-calling say about masculinity and gender dynamics?\n\n\n\nA: Trump and Vance echo centuries of incorporating misogyny, racism, xenophobia, and ableism with claims about humans\u2019 superiority over animals, or what is often referred to as speciesim. Trump has described undocumented immigrants as \u201canimals,\u201d Nikki Haley as \u201cbirdbrained,\u201d Nancy Pelosi and Omarosa Manigault Newman as dogs and Pelosi also as \u201ccrazy as a bed bug,\u201d and of course he routinely refers to his former lover Stormy Daniels as \u201chorseface.\u201d Comparing people to animals who are viewed as \u201cundesirable\u201d or who have \u201cundesirable characteristics\u201d is an effective way to denigrate them, and women and members of marginalized groups are especially targeted with this kind of language in political discourse because, dating back to at least the Enlightenment, they have been constructed as being more animal-like\u2026 No doubt Trump and Vance are mobilizing their masculinity against Harris and other powerful women. Harris\u2019 race makes language about her as animal less socially acceptable, so I don\u2019t know if we will hear specifically that kind of language about her from Trump or Vance. But I think we\u2019d be hard pressed to find another U.S. public figure with such a wide audience who is as openly and consistently misogynistic and as committed to maintaining a firm gender boundary in which women are subordinate as Trump\u2014and he often integrates speciesism with misogyny.\n\nRegarding Vance\u2019s 2021 comment, there are so many layers of meaning here\u2014cat ladies are presumed childless, unhappy, and dissatisfied with their life choices. And Vance identifies a gay man, Pete Buttigieg, as a cat lady, a classic example of the homophobic strategy of feminizing gay men. Empirically, there is no evidence to suggest that childfree people are less invested in community affairs or well-being than those with children; to the contrary, reams of scholarship focus on the contributions, large and small, of childfree people to supporting the well-being of other people\u2019s children and to their broader communities.\n\nQ: For many people, opting to have children is not simply a matter of \u201cwanting\u201d to be a mother/parent. What other factors have you found influence childbearing?\n\n\n\nA: A lot goes into whether people have children or not, including financial considerations, physical health, cultural expectations, and professional goals. Increasingly, deep distress about big issues \u2014 like social and political polarization, or even the climate crisis \u2014 are playing a role in young people\u2019s parenting plans. Ultimately, having the ability to make decisions about whether to have a child or not is an important human right.\n\nQ: Reproductive rights is a hot topic. What do Americans need to understand about population control, women\u2019s rights, and climate change?\n\n\n\nA: Americans need to understand how far we\u2019ve come since the days of the \u201cpopulation bomb\u201d ideas of the 1960s: population has not exploded as predicted, and food resources have not been precarious as crisis narratives suggest. At the same time, climate change has become a pressing issue everywhere. Fighting climate change is a key component to helping people feel good about the future, whether they want to bring children into that future or not.\n\n\n\n\n\nHeader image: 2024 elections illustration by UCR/Robert Almanzar.",

BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI / AFP\n\nUS President Joe Biden and Kamala Harris campaigned together for the first time on Monday, September 2, in a public display of teamwork after she replaced him as candidate and revived Democratic election hopes. Seeking to attract voters in the key battleground state of Pennsylvania, the pair met union members in Pittsburg before standing side-by-side to speak to about 600 supporters.\n\nBiden repeatedly name-checked Vice President Harris, who is in a close race to beat Donald Trump to the White House on November 5. \"We have made a lot of progress, and Kamala and I are going to build on that progress, and she's going to build on it,\" Biden said. \"I'll be on the sidelines, but I'll do everything I can to help.\"\n\nThe Labor Day event at the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers union underlined how Biden will play a role in the campaign in the final months before the vote.\n\nRead more Subscribers only Kamala Harris seeks to embody a reconciled and optimistic America\n\n'I know her. I trust her'\n\nBiden, 81, initially resisted bowing out of the presidential race after his disastrous debate performance against Trump, but he has since swung behind Harris, 59. \"There's only one person you have a rational choice with this time \u2013 that's Kamala Harris,\" he said to cheers. \"I know her. I trust her,\" he added. \"She has a backbone like a ramrod and the compass of a saint.\" \"This woman knows what she's doing. I promise you, if you elect Kamala Harris as president, it will be the best decision you will have ever made.\"\n\nRead more Subscribers only Harris is redefining feminism and femininity in politics\n\nRiding a wave of enthusiasm, Harris has held packed rallies across the country and raked in cash donations over recent weeks. Polls show her entry improving the Democrats' chances at defeating Republican Trump, but with the outcome highly uncertain.\n\nIn Pittsburg, Biden and Harris embraced and held hands before she paid him fulsome praise. \"Joe Biden has been one of the most transformative presidents in the United States that we have ever witnessed, and it comes from his heart,\" she said. \"Joe and I talk a lot about the fact that we are so proud to be the most pro-union administration in America's history.\" \"We're not going back!\" the crowd chanted, using one of her campaign slogans.\n\nHarris used the campaign appearance to say that US Steel should remain domestically owned \u2013 concurring with the White House's monthslong opposition to the company's planned sale to Japan's Nippon Steel: \"US Steel should remain American-owned and American-operated, and I will always have the backs of America's steelworkers,\" she said.\n\nThat echoes Biden, who repeated Monday what he's said since March \u2013 that he opposes US Steel's would-be sale to Nippon, believing it would hurt the country's steelworkers. It also overlaps with Republican former President Donald Trump. It's little surprise that Harris would agree with Biden on the issue, but it nonetheless constitutes a major policy position for the vice president, who has offered relatively few of them since Biden abandoned his reelection bid and endorsed his vice president in July.\n\n'Why is Donald Trump MIA on Labor Day?'\n\nTrump took the weekend off from campaigning, and did not have public events scheduled Monday. \"For a candidate that claims to be rallying the support of workers, why is Donald Trump MIA [mission in action] on Labor Day?\" the Harris campaign needled in a statement. The Republican, in a post on his Truth Social platform, touted claims about his economic record and accused Harris and Biden of having \"undone all of that.\"\n\nRead more Subscribers only Trump contradicts himself on abortion in search of political gain\n\nHarris last appeared with Biden after his speech two weeks ago at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. As she hurries to define her platform, the vice president has sought to promise change \u2013 while avoiding criticism of Biden's tenure.\n\nHarris has faced scrutiny for pivoting from the liberal positions she ran on when competing against Biden for the Democratic nomination in 2020. She had previously pledged to ban fracking \u2013 a major source of income in Pennsylvania \u2013 but now has ruled that out. Pennsylvania is one of a handful of states that will decide the election, and is possibly the one on which the whole result will hinge.\n\nMonday's joint appearance with Biden also launched the two-month sprint to the vote, with Labor Day marking the traditional end of the US summer. \"Friends, 64 days until the most important election of our lives, and probably one of the most important in the life of our nation,\" Harris said, describing herself as the underdog in the race. \"We have some hard work then ahead of us. But here's the beauty of us in this room \u2013 we like our work. Hard work is good work.\"\n\nRead more Subscribers only Harris neither crashes nor shines during first televised interview as candidate\n\nHarris's running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, separately campaigned in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.",

        "text": "The state of the 2024 race, explained in 7 charts\ncovers politics and society for Vox. She first joined Vox in 2019, and her work has also appeared in Politico, Washington Monthly, and the New Republic.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has pulled slightly ahead in national polls against former President Donald Trump. Still, the race is pretty tight, and it looks like it will remain that way until Election Day.\n\nDespite polling errors that overestimated Democrats\u2019 performance in the popular vote in 2016 and 2020, head-to-head polls are still the best signal of what the election outcome will be \u2014 though it\u2019s important to keep in mind that no single poll will be exactly right, and that some polls have better methodologies than others.\n\nBut head-to-head polling isn\u2019t the only way to gauge the state of play. Other election indicators \u2014 ranging from approval ratings and sentiments among key groups of voters to economic measures and campaign spending \u2014 all provide crucial context about where the electorate and this campaign are headed.\n\nHere are some factors beyond topline numbers that we think are especially crucial to help you gain a fuller understanding of the race.\n\nBiden\u2019s approval rating\n\nPresident Joe Biden may have stepped aside from the Democratic nomination, but that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s irrelevant: Biden\u2019s approval rating is a proxy for how voters feel about his administration \u2014 one whose record Harris has for the most part defended.\n\nIt would be a worrying sign for Harris if that number \u2014 which already made Biden historically unpopular before he dropped out \u2014 stagnates or goes down before the election.\n\nThat \u201cwould be a negative verdict on the incumbent administration, which she is part of,\u201d said Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball, a nonpartisan political analysis newsletter, at the University of Virginia Center for Politics. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t take that as predictive on its own, but I do think the president\u2019s approval rating still merits watching, even though he\u2019s not a candidate anymore.\u201d\n\nHarris has so far managed to both take credit for Biden\u2019s popular policies and decouple herself from his most unpopular policies. Her approval rating is about 42 percent, up from about 38 percent when Biden dropped out on July 21, according to FiveThirtyEight\u2019s polling average. Biden, on the other hand, so far hasn\u2019t gotten the kind of boost that many people thought he might after dropping out: His approval rating is only up about 2 percentage points to 41 percent.\n\nThat number could be a liability for Harris because \u201cRepublicans are gonna do their damage to connect all of the unpopular things with Biden to Harris,\u201d Kondik said. \u201cIt\u2019s just the question of whether it works or not. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worked yet.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s favorability rating\n\nFor nine years now, more Americans have viewed Trump more unfavorably than favorably. But Trump\u2019s favorability is also rising notably, suggesting that he has expanded his appeal.\n\nThat may be because the memory of his first term, when he was incredibly unpopular, has faded somewhat in the public\u2019s consciousness. What voters may remember fondly is that the economy was doing well under his presidency until the pandemic hit. Other voters may just like that he\u2019s not Harris or Biden.\n\n\u201cI think to some degree, independents have less of a negative association with him now that he\u2019s out of office and has been for a while, and they weren\u2019t really happy with the Biden administration,\u201d said Lakshya Jain, a partner at the political forecasting firm Split Ticket.\n\nTrump has maintained a strong base of support among Republicans, leveraging the numerous indictments against him to make the case that he has been targeted as an anti-establishment candidate. He\u2019s also made overtures to moderates, including by somewhat dialing back the restrictive Republican stance on abortion.\n\nAt the same time, however, it would be wrong to say that Trump is popular.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say he\u2019s cracked through a massive ceiling on favorability, because his negatives are still [high],\u201d Jain said. Indeed, they\u2019re currently more than 10 percentage points higher on average than his favorability ratings.\n\nWhether these unfavorable numbers move as the campaign kicks into high gear in the fall and people get reacquainted with the former president remains to be seen. If they rise, that could signal trouble for Trump on Election Day.\n\nThe share of undecided voters in major battleground states\n\nPolls in battleground states suggest that Harris and Trump are practically in a dead heat. That means even the few percent of voters who remain undecided could tip the scales one way or the other. Keeping an eye on these voters will be key to understanding what to expect in each of the swing states.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s hard to assess what way they\u2019re leaning: Because there are so few undecided voters, pollsters often can\u2019t get an accurate read on how they\u2019re feeling. Demographically, they tend to be a bit younger and more diverse than the rest of the electorate, and they also tend to skew a bit more female. All of that would \u201csuggest that Kamala Harris would have more upside with them,\u201d said David Wasserman, senior editor and elections analyst at the Cook Political Report.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean Democrats should assume they now have an edge in swing states. These undecided voters also exhibit traits that might make them lean toward Trump. Wasserman said they are more distrustful of institutions and government, tend to work blue-collar jobs, have less than a four-year college degree, have broad dissatisfaction with the two-party system, and believe that the Biden administration has mishandled the economy.\n\n\u201cThese are cross-pressured voters who may not turn out to vote at all at the end of the day, but that is a group that we\u2019re watching closely,\u201d Wasserman said.\n\nHarris\u2019s growth among key groups of voters\n\nHarris has shown the potential to improve with groups of voters who Biden had struggled with and are projected to play a key role in the election \u2014 like independents, Hispanic voters, and infrequent voters.\n\nThat last group was of particular concern for Biden. When he was the nominee, some strategists suggested that higher turnout would hurt Democrats because infrequent voters were less likely to support him.\n\n\u201cThere was an overwhelming sentiment among infrequent voters that Biden would not be able to fulfill his responsibilities for a second term, and for the first half of the year, Democrats were publicly in denial about that,\u201d Wasserman said.\n\nBut among registered voters who did not vote in 2020, Harris improved by 9 percentage points in New York Times/Siena College polls conducted before and after Biden dropped out, suggesting that she has narrowed Trump\u2019s advantage with that group. That growth suggests she has appeal with voters who aren\u2019t hardcore partisans \u2014 and that she might have further opportunities for growth.\n\nAny significant movement among Black and Latino voters toward Trump is also notable and could prove decisive in certain swing states. In 2020, Trump made gains with Latinos not just in Florida and Texas, but also in Pennsylvania. Black voters will play a key role in Georgia, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, and some of them appear to be moving toward Trump.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s lower-propensity Black voters who are open to voting for Trump, and they are not guaranteed to show up. But even so, if Trump wins 15 percent of the Black vote, that would likely be enough to tip Georgia and Michigan and Pennsylvania to the Republican column,\u201d Wasserman said. \u201cThat means that Kamala Harris has to make it up somewhere else, and that\u2019s hard.\u201d\n\nTo still win after losing those three states, Harris would likely need to sweep the rest of the swing states and pick up a large state that Democrats have struggled in, like North Carolina.\n\nThat said, Kondik said that he is skeptical any shift among Black voters would be large, and that polling errors might be overstating the extent to which Black voters are supporting Trump. \u201cI think that\u2019s a mirage,\u201d he said.\n\nSecond-quarter economic growth\n\nIf there\u2019s a single issue most likely to determine the election, it\u2019s probably the economy, which is at or near the top of issues that voters prioritize across multiple polls. The economy is also worth watching because it has previously had electoral significance.\n\nA key variable in Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball\u2019s election forecasting model is economic growth leading up to an election: specifically, second-quarter percent change in gross domestic product (GDP), the total value of goods and services produced in the US.\n\nThat change has \u201cproven to be historically electorally important,\u201d Kondik said. Sabato\u2019s didn\u2019t use it in their 2020 model because the pandemic contributed to a big downturn in economic growth that would have suggested Trump would lose in a landslide, which seemed unlikely \u2014 and indeed, he ended up losing what was a tight race.\n\nBut there\u2019s no reason to believe that this year is similarly exceptional.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s a big crash, the incumbent party almost always suffers some sort of penalty. This is kind of what doomed John McCain in 2008,\u201d Jain said.\n\nInterest rates\n\nThe Federal Reserve started raising interest rates in mid-2022, increasing borrowing costs and dampening consumer confidence in the economy through much of this year. The Fed\u2019s goal was to get high inflation under control; now that inflation has cooled, the Fed is expected to finally cut rates again in September.\n\nA rate cut might not be a complete game-changer for Harris, especially since \u201ca lot of the effect of the economy on the election is already \u2018baked in\u2019 at this late date\u201d in that most people have already made up their minds about the Biden administration\u2019s performance on the issue, said John Sides, political science professor at Vanderbilt University.\n\nHowever, it might give her more ammunition to fight off Republican attacks on Biden\u2019s economic record. Not only would it provide some immediate relief to homeowners and homebuyers by bringing down mortgage interest rates, it would also signal that the Fed is willing to step in to help workers in a tougher job market. A rate cut would ease financial pressure on businesses that kept them from hiring as much as they were during the pandemic.\n\nTrump has blamed Harris and Biden for high inflation and household debt and promised to reinstate \u201cthe best economy in the history of our country,\u201d which he falsely claimed was during his first term. (His term saw an annual average of between 2 and 3 percent GDP growth, not counting the pandemic economy of 2020, while yearly GDP growth averaged nearly 5 percent in the 1960s.) That has proved persuasive among the majority of voters who prefer him to Harris on the issue, but Harris has also closed that gap somewhat. Harris has argued that she and Biden inherited an economic mess from Trump and have largely managed to clean it up: inflation is down, growth has remained relatively strong, and the labor market is still on solid footing despite a recent downturn in job growth, all without triggering a recession. However, it\u2019s not clear how effective that argument is among consumers who are still struggling with higher prices and more debt.\n\n\u201cIn general, I think a rate cut would be a bit of welcome \u2018good news\u2019 for the Harris campaign that might help weaken the Trump campaign\u2019s economic argument,\u201d Sides said.\n\nThe difference in Democratic and Republican spending in key states\n\nThe amount of dollars spent in presidential elections by each party isn\u2019t necessarily predictive of election outcomes. Piles of cash can\u2019t compensate for poor spending decisions or bad candidates. And there are diminishing returns on ad spending.\n\nBut the difference in party spending in major battleground states can reveal something about which party has momentum where, and how competitive they perceive that state to be, Jain said. If one party is being outspent by the other in a particular state, that can indicate one of two things: either they think they already have it in the bag and don\u2019t need to spend more, or they\u2019ve backed off because it doesn\u2019t seem winnable and are focusing their resources elsewhere. As of now, Republicans are being outspent in a few battlegrounds where Trump is not polling as well as Harris (though it\u2019s very close).\n\nBeyond the major battlegrounds, it\u2019s also important to pay attention to spending aimed at expanding the map for either Republicans or Democrats. Any money spent outside Arizona, Nevada, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Georgia, and Nebraska (which allocates three of its five electoral votes to whichever candidate wins the vote in its three electoral districts) might signal as much. Notably, it seems that both parties are planning to spend fairly heavily in states including Texas and Florida this fall.\n\nThat would suggest that Democrats see some path to victory in those traditionally Republican states that isn\u2019t immediately obvious to observers lacking their internal polling, that they feel secure enough in other key states to spend money on long shots, or that they feel they have enough money to force the GOP to \u201cwaste\u201d money on states that should be safe for them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really curious to see if there\u2019s any heavy television spending in states other than the big seven, plus Nebraska,\u201d Kondik said. \u201cIf money is spent in any other place, I\u2019ll be interested in that. So, Republicans go on TV in Minneapolis, St. Paul, or Democrats go on TV this fall in Miami.\u201d Such moves might indicate a party is feeling bullish about expanding the map.",

Netanyahu has one interest: his own immediate political survival, even if it undermines Israel\u2019s long-term survival.\n\nMadam Vice President, have no doubt, this will lead him to do things in the next two months that could seriously harm your election chances and strengthen Donald Trump\u2019s. Be afraid.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. President, please, please tell me that Netanyahu has not played you for a fool. You have had repeated conversations with him, each followed by your optimistic predictions about an imminent cease-fire in Gaza \u2014 and then he tells his followers something else.\n\nNetanyahu is one reason that I coined this rule about Middle East reporting: In Washington, officials tell you the truth in private and lie in public.

The Justice Department announced the ongoing seizure of 32 internet domains used in Russian government-directed foreign malign influence campaigns .",
        "text": "Justice Department Disrupts Covert Russian Government-Sponsored Foreign Malign Influence Operation Targeting Audiences in the United States and Elsewhere\nNote: View the affidavit here.\n\nThe Justice Department today announced the ongoing seizure of 32 internet domains used in Russian government-directed foreign malign influence campaigns colloquially referred to as \u201cDoppelganger,\u201d in violation of U.S. money laundering and criminal trademark laws. As alleged in an unsealed affidavit, the Russian companies Social Design Agency (SDA), Structura National Technology (Structura), and ANO Dialog, operating under the direction and control of the Russian Presidential Administration, and in particular First Deputy Chief of Staff of the Presidential Executive Office Sergei Vladilenovich Kiriyenko, used these domains, among others, to covertly spread Russian government propaganda with the aim of reducing international support for Ukraine, bolstering pro-Russian policies and interests, and influencing voters in U.S. and foreign elections, including the U.S. 2024 Presidential Election.\n\nIn conjunction with the domain seizures, the U.S. Treasury Department announced the designation of 10 individuals and two entities as part of a coordinated response to Russia\u2019s malign influence efforts targeting the 2024 U.S. presidential election. This announcement follows the designation of actors involved in Doppelganger announced by the Treasury Department in March.\n\n\u201cThe Justice Department is seizing 32 internet domains that the Russian government and Russian government-sponsored actors have used to engage in a covert campaign to interfere in and influence the outcome of our country\u2019s elections,\u201d said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. \u201cAs alleged in our court filings, President Vladimir Putin\u2019s inner circle, including Sergei Kiriyenko, directed Russian public relations companies to promote disinformation and state-sponsored narratives as part of a campaign to influence the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election. An internal planning document created by the Kremlin states that a goal of the campaign is to secure Russia\u2019s preferred outcome in the election. The sites we are seizing today were filled with Russian government propaganda that had been created by the Kremlin to reduce international support for Ukraine, bolster pro-Russian policies and interests, and influence voters in the United States and other countries. Our actions today make clear that the Justice Department will be aggressive in countering and disrupting attempts by the Russian government, or any other malign actor, to interfere in our elections and undermine our democracy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Department\u2019s seizure of 32 internet domains secretly deployed to spread foreign malign influence demonstrates once again that Russia remains a predominant foreign threat to our elections,\u201d said Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco. \u201cAt Putin\u2019s direction, Russian companies SDA, Structura, and ANO Dialog used cybersquatting, fabricated influencers, and fake profiles to covertly promote AI-generated false narratives on social media. Those narratives targeted specific American demographics and regions in a calculated effort to subvert our election. Our republic depends on elections that are free from foreign interference, and we will not rest in our efforts to expose foreign malign influence operations and protect our democracy, without fear or favor.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s announcement exposes the scope of the Russian government\u2019s influence operations and their reliance on cutting-edge AI to sow disinformation,\u201d said FBI Director Christopher Wray. \u201cCompanies operating at the direction of the Russian government created websites to trick Americans into unwittingly consuming Russian propaganda. By seizing these websites, the FBI is making clear to the world what they are, Russian attempts to interfere in our elections and influence our society. The FBI will continue to work with our partners to expose and shutdown these covert influence campaigns.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis seizure illustrates vividly what the U.S. government and private sector partners have warned for months: the Russian government and its proxies are aggressively accelerating the Kremlin\u2019s covert efforts to seed false stories and amplify disinformation directed at the American public,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen of the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement reveals Russia is willing to impersonate our free and open press in its egregious schemes. This is our third disruption of Russian foreign malign influence operations in two months, and the Justice Department remains relentless in protecting Americans from such unacceptable conduct. To Russia, and any other government seeking to stoke discord in our society: know that we will spare no effort and use every available tool to disrupt and expose this malign activity and defend our democratic institutions.\u201d\n\n\u201cProtecting our democratic processes from foreign malign influence is paramount to ensure enduring public trust,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Jacqueline C. Romero for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. \u201cAs America\u2019s adversaries continue to spew propaganda and disinformation towards the American electorate, we\u2019ll use every tool at our disposal to expose and dismantle their insidious foreign influence campaigns.\u201d\n\nThe propaganda did not identify, and in fact purposefully obfuscated, the Russian government or its agents as the source of the content. The perpetrators extensively utilized \u201ccybersquatted\u201d domains, a method of registering a domain intended to mimic another person or company\u2019s website (e.g., registering washingtonpost.pm to mimic washingtonpost.com), to publish Russian government messaging falsely presented as content from legitimate news media organizations. In other instances, the perpetrators sought to create their own unique media brands to promote Doppelganger content (e.g., Recent Reliable News). Among the methods Doppelganger used to drive viewership to the cybersquatted and unique media domains was the deployment of \u201cinfluencers\u201d worldwide, paid social media advertisements (in some cases created using artificial intelligence tools), and the creation of social media profiles posing as U.S. (or other non-Russian) citizens to post comments on social media platforms with links to the cybersquatted domains, all of which attempted to trick viewers into believing they were being directed to a legitimate news media outlet\u2019s website.\n\nOverview\n\nThe affidavit describes the perpetrators\u2019 own internal strategy meeting notes, project proposals, and other records obtained during the course of the investigation. Several notable propaganda project proposals directed against the United States included:\n\nGood Old USA Project: Attachments 8A, 8B\n\nThe Guerilla Media Campaign: Attachments 9A, 9B\n\nU.S. Social Media Influencers Network Project: Attachments 10A, 10B\n\nDoppelganger\u2019s foreign malign influence efforts were not directed solely against audiences in the United States. Other targets of the perpetrators\u2019 propaganda included Germany, Mexico, and Israel, among others. Doppelganger\u2019s influence campaigns sought to influence the citizenry of those countries to support Russian government objectives, including by undermining the United States\u2019 relationship with those countries.\n\nDoppelganger\u2019s use of the U.S.-based domain names at the direction and control of, and for the benefit of, sanctioned persons, including Sergei Vladilenovich Kiriyenko, SDA, and Structura, violates the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). As a result, the accompanying payments for Doppelganger\u2019s online infrastructure violate federal money laundering laws. In addition, Doppelganger\u2019s publication of content on cybersquatted domains with names and content that mimic legitimate media outlets violates federal criminal trademark laws because those domains feature trademarks registered on the Principal Register maintained by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.\n\nThe FBI Philadelphia Field Office is investigating the case.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section and National Security Cyber Section are prosecuting the case, with valuable assistance from the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section.",

        "text": "Can 0.03% of US votes really swing the presidential election?\nIn recent years there has been growing criticism of the electoral college system in the US because it has allowed a tiny number of Americans to determine the outcome of the presidential election.\n\nIn 2020, about 43,000 votes among Wisconsin, Georgia and Arizona \u2013 a mere 0.03% of the votes cast nationwide \u2013 allowed Joe Biden to win. In 2016, about 80,000 combined votes gave Donald Trump his winning margins in key swing states.\n\nHow does this happen? How is such a slim margin so decisive in an election in which 154.6m votes are cast? Here\u2019s how it works.\n\nBiden vs. Trump 2020 Biden victories\n\nPopular vote winning margin, % Trump victories\n\nPopular vote winning margin, % % margin of victory\n\nper state district Biden 306 votes Trump 232 votes Source: Federal Election Commission, 2016 and 2020 results\n\nFootnote: Maine and Nebraska allocate two electoral college votes to the statewide winner. Each state then awards its remaining electors \u2013 two in Maine and three in Nebraska \u2013 to the winner in each of the state\u2019s congressional districts. Each US state is assigned a certain number of electoral college votes; some states have more than others. To win the US presidency, a candidate has to win more of these electoral college votes than their opponent. This means that when they win the popular vote in an individual state, they get the electoral college votes assigned to that state - represented here by the height of each block. Block by block, a candidate needs to reach a majority of 270 to win. In 2020, Biden earned 306 electoral votes. Not all states are won in the same way, though. Let\u2019s rebuild our towers so that each block\u2019s width reflects the margin of victory \u2014 or the extent to which each candidate won the popular vote in each state. Narrow blocks were won by close victories, wider ones represent landslide wins. Both Biden and Trump had some states where they won by a comfortable margin of more than 20% of the popular vote. For Biden, this included populous states like California and New York, which gave him 55 and 29 electoral college votes respectively. Both candidates also secured other states where they won by a margin of between 5 to 20% of the popular vote. For Trump, whose landslide victories tended to happen in less populous states, this meant winning Texas\u2019s extensive 28 electoral votes with a majority of only 5.7%. But in 2020, this wasn\u2019t enough to get to a majority of 270 electoral votes. Joe Biden won the presidency with three states in which he had a lead of less than 1%: Georgia, Arizona and Wisconsin. Combined, this meant he won the presidency with 43,000 popular votes. Trump secured his victory in 2016 in a similar way. His lead in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin was less than 1% of the popular vote, but this was enough to give the Republicans the last needed 46 electoral college votes.\n\nThe challenge in 2024\n\nPresidential candidates need at least 270 electoral votes \u2013 more than half of the total \u2013 to win an election. As narrow victories can get parties over the line and determine the election, those states with very close wins, often called \u201cswing states\u201d, get special attention from pollsters, campaigners and pundits.\n\nIn the 2024 election, there are six swing states: Pennsylvania (19 electoral votes), Wisconsin (10), Michigan (15), Georgia (16), Arizona (11) and Nevada (6). The Harris campaign also considers North Carolina, usually a Republican state in the presidential race, and its 16 electoral votes to be competitive. Whichever candidate wins the election must carry some combination of those states.\n\nThe idea of a swing state can also change over time with shifting demographics and political trends. Until recently, for example, Ohio and Florida were considered swing states, but they are now considered to be pretty solidly Republican. Michigan was considered a relatively solid Democratic stronghold until Trump won it in 2016.\n\nOver the next few months, Trump and Kamala Harris will spend most of their time campaigning in these states, knowing that these voters will determine the outcome of the election.\n\n\n\n\n\nCriticisms of the electoral system\n\nThese very narrow wins in recent elections add into the growing criticism that the power of a presidential vote depends on where one lives.\n\nThe least populous states, such as North and South Dakota, and the smaller states of New England are overrepresented because of the required minimum of three electoral votes.\n\nElectoral votes are assigned to each state according to their population. But then each of them gets two more to represent their Senate seats \u2013 which means less populous states get a minimum of three electoral votes, regardless of the size of their population. Meanwhile, the states with the most people \u2013 California, Texas and Florida \u2013 are underrepresented in the electoral college.\n\nThis means that while one elector in Wyoming represents 195,000 people, in a state like Texas, one elector represents 763,000 people.\n\nThis has become more relevant in recent times, as during the last 20 years the number of states won by margins of more than 15% \u2013 a landslide win \u2013 has increased.",

        "text": "Experts react: The US just accused Russia of meddling in the 2024 election. Here\u2019s what to know.\nIt\u2019s campaign season\u2014and that includes malign influence campaigns. On Wednesday, the Biden administration announced new sanctions, criminal charges, and the seizure of more than thirty internet domains in response to what it alleges is an expansive malign influence operation by Russia targeting the 2024 US presidential election. According to US officials, the Kremlin used state-run media outlets, such as RT, as well as front organizations to spread false information and pro-Russian propaganda across social media. Today\u2019s announcements follow reports of Russian interference in previous US elections that cast a long shadow over US politics.\n\nBelow, Atlantic Council experts shed light on what today\u2019s announcements mean and what to expect next.\n\nClick to jump to an expert analysis:\n\nGraham Brookie: This multifaceted effort shows exposure is not enough to fight malign election influence\n\nJohn E. Herbst: The US has made it harder for Russia to have an impact this November\n\nMark Scott: Russia\u2019s actions underscore the need for more transparency and oversight for social media platforms\n\nSuriya Jayanti: A valuable reminder that Russia is an enemy state\n\nThis multifaceted effort shows exposure is not enough to fight malign election influence\n\nThe US government once again confirmed today that foreign malign influence efforts\u2014which include major efforts by Russia and Iran\u2014are real, ongoing, and actively targeting the foundations of American democracy. The announcement sheds light on evolving foreign threats to US elections, as well as a more comprehensive response by the US government.\n\nPer the Department of Justice indictment, Russia\u2019s influence efforts have clear goals to favor one US political campaign, diminish public confidence in the other, and undermine US support to Ukraine. The evidence provided cited original research from the Digital Forensic Research Lab (DFRLab) on Russia\u2019s doppelg\u00e4nger network and other covert efforts to deceive the American public. While some of Russia\u2019s efforts achieved impressive social media statistics and millions of views, there is little evidence to suggest Russia succeeded in directly changing many hearts or minds.\n\nThe US government response included thorough indictments using varied legal tools from the Department of Justice, sanctions from the Treasury Department, and rewards for further exposure of malign influence efforts from the Department of State. This was a multifaceted approach that shows exposure is not enough. An array of actions is needed to stay above the partisan fray and effectively respond to malign influence as a national security threat. Today\u2019s announcements, along with the regular public briefings by the US intelligence community about ongoing malign influence efforts ahead of the election, show that the United States is on alert and building resilience.\n\n\u2014Graham Brookie is the Atlantic Council\u2019s vice president for technology programs and strategy, as well as the senior director of the DFRLab.\n\nThe US has made it harder for Russia to have an impact this November\n\nThere are times when the US government is able to marshal its formidable resources and, in a comprehensive and effective manner, address a serious challenge. Today, the Biden administration provided a welcome example of that as the Justice, Treasury, and State departments, working also with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), took decisive steps to disrupt a major Russian disinformation campaign to influence upcoming US elections. The Department of Justice indicted \u201ctwo employees of RT, a Russian state-controlled media outlet, in a $10 million scheme to create and distribute content to U.S. audiences with hidden Russian government messaging.\u201d The Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control designated ten individuals and two entities for their role in this Kremlin effort to target US elections. The State Department is taking measures to ensure that the named individuals either never receive a US visa or have their visas revoked. And all of this was enabled by the investigations of the FBI.\n\nThis news did not come out of the blue. After all, Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines testified in Congress in May that Moscow was leading the pack among foreign governments in seeking to alter the course of this year\u2019s presidential election. Nonetheless, this was a bold move designed to throw the Kremlin off balance. And it succeeded, including the leak of a message from senior Kremlin official Sergey Kiriyenko outlining the goal of influencing the election. All of this is reminiscent of the administration\u2019s deft intelligence dump in the fall of 2021 that correctly depicted what Moscow would do when it launched its large invasion of Ukraine months later. The administration\u2019s move will make it harder for Moscow to have an impact this November. But the Kremlin will keep trying.\n\n\u2014John E. Herbst is the senior director of the Atlantic Council\u2019s Eurasia Center and a former US ambassador to Ukraine.\n\nRussia\u2019s actions underscore the need for more transparency and oversight for social media platforms\n\nThis is not the first time Russian-backed groups have tried to undermine democracies with covert influence campaigns. What we have seen across Europe, at least over the last two years, is an increasingly sophisticated effort by groups with direct ties to the Kremlin. That strategy has included the creation of fake websites, which pretended to be mainstream media outlets but were, in fact, used to spread Russian propaganda and disinformation directly to local social media users.\n\nThe main goal of all these Russian-backed influence campaigns is to promote Moscow\u2019s worldview, which attacks Ukraine, seeks to undermine countries\u2019 democratic institutions, and portrays the West as the main instigator of global harm. Given ongoing efforts by Washington and its allies to debunk such claims, Moscow has been forced to use increasingly complex covert efforts\u2014spread from, in this case, Tennessee in the United States to Chi\u0219in\u0103u in Moldova to Caracas in Venezuela.\n\nWhat the Department of Justice announced also highlights the ongoing need for greater transparency and outside oversight over what happens on social media. This clandestine Russian operation was able to post nearly two thousand videos, which garnered more than sixteen million views, collectively, on YouTube, according to the US government. The campaign was also active on TikTok, Instagram, and X. It\u2019s a clear sign more needs to be done to give outside groups greater powers to track such covert state-backed influence operations, which, in this case, racked up such a large viewership.\n\n\u2014Mark Scott is a senior resident fellow with the DFRLab\u2019s Democracy + Tech Initiative and a former chief technology correspondent for Politico.\n\nA valuable reminder that Russia is an enemy state\n\nThe 2024 elections were always going to be a lure for foreign meddling, so of course Russia has been busy at it. But so have Iran and China. (Even purportedly friendly countries like Israel have mounted political influence campaigns.) The White House decision to spotlight Russia two months before the presidential poll may be something of a dog whistle given the widespread but ultimately unproven belief that Russian interference helped tip the 2016 election to Donald Trump. Unfortunately, with rampant\u2014but entirely unjustified\u2014allegations of election \u201cstealing\u201d already swirling on the MAGA right, any added election integrity concerns are likely to add fuel to an already blazing fire. But the Biden administration\u2019s allegations are almost certainly true, and they are in line with Kremlin efforts worldwide to spread narratives in support of its illegal war in Ukraine. Today\u2019s actions are good news for the continued prospects of US aid for Ukraine, as they remind the American public once again that Russia is an enemy state.\n\n\u2014Suriya Evans-Prichard Jayanti is a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Eurasia Center and a former cybersecurity chief at the US embassy in Ukraine.\n\nFurther reading\n\nRelated Experts: Graham Brookie, John E.

Attorney General Merrick Garland: \"The American people are entitled to know when a foreign power is attempting to exploit our country's free exchange of ideas\" Treasury Department also sanctions a popular pro-Russian hacktivist group, RaHDIt .",
        "text": "Biden administration hits Russia with sanctions over efforts to manipulate U.S. opinion ahead of the election\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Departments of Justice, State and Treasury announced Wednesday a joint effort to target with sanctions and criminal charges what the Biden administration says are Russian government-sponsored attempts to manipulate U.S. public opinion ahead of the November election.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland announced charges against two employees of the Russian-backed media network RT accused of conspiring to commit money laundering and violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act in an indictment unsealed Wednesday in the Southern District of New York.\n\n\"The American people are entitled to know when a foreign power is attempting to exploit our country's free exchange of ideas in order to send around its own propaganda,\" Garland said.\n\nWhile the indictment redacted the names of political parties and candidates, it was clear through the documents that the Russians sought to bolster Republican former President Donald Trump and to harm Democratic efforts \u2014 whose nominee likely would have been Joe Biden at the time.\n\nGarland accused Konstantin Kalashnikov and Elena Afanasyeva of implementing a nearly $10 million scheme to hire a Tennessee-based company to publish and disseminate pro-Russian content. That company then contracted with U.S.-based social media influencers to share content on their platforms. The information was \"often consistent with Russia\u2019s interest in amplifying U.S. domestic divisions in order to weaken U.S. opposition to core Russian interests, particularly its ongoing war in Ukraine,\" the attorney general said.\n\nKalashnikov identified himself as RT's \"Deputy Chief of the Digital Media Projects Department,\" and Afanasyeva has identified herself on social media as a \"producer at RT, dealing with overseas affairs and news,\" the indictment said.\n\n\"The company never disclosed to the influencers or to their millions of followers as ties to RT and the Russian government. Instead, the defendants and the company claimed that the company was sponsored by a private investor, but that private investor was a fictitious persona,\" Garland said.\n\nThe company published \"hundreds of videos\" that contained \"commentary on events and issues in the United States, such as immigration, inflation, and other topics related to domestic and foreign policy.\"\n\nAt the White House briefing, when asked if high-level Russian officials were clued into RT\u2019s activity, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said that the U.S. believes Russian President Vladimir Putin was aware.\n\n\u201cWe believe Mr. Putin is weighing in on these actions,\u201d Kirby said.\n\n'We have no tolerance'\n\nThe attorney general said that the investigation remains ongoing and that the DOJ is seizing 32 internet domains that the Russian government and Russian actors have used to influence the U.S. election.\n\nThe attorney general made clear that Iran has also been responsible for activities seeking to compromise former President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign in an effort to interfere with the election outcome.\n\n\u201cThe Justice Department\u2019s message is clear: We have no tolerance for attempts by authoritarian regimes to exploit our democratic system of government. We will be relentlessly aggressive in countering and disrupting attempts by Russia, Iran, as well as China or any other foreign malign actor, interfere in elections and undermine our members.\"\n\nBefore Garland's announcement, the Treasury Department announced that its Office of Foreign Assets Control had designated 10 people and two entities as part of a \"coordinated U.S. government response to Moscow\u2019s malign influence efforts targeting the 2024 U.S. presidential election.\"\n\nThe Treasury Department weighed in on the influence campaign, saying in its announcement of sanctions that RT \"used a front company to disguise its own involvement or the involvement of the Russian government in content meant to influence U.S. audiences.\"\n\nTreasury also sanctioned a popular pro-Russian hacktivist group, RaHDIt, and said it was actually headed by current and former Russian intelligence officers. It\u2019s run by Aleksey Alekseyevich Garashchenko, who at the time of the group\u2019s founding was an active member of the FSB, the successor agency to the KGB, and still maintains direct contact with Kremlin intelligence agencies, Treasury said.\n\nRaHDIt is one of dozens of pro-Russia hacktivist groups that has appeared since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Like most of those groups, it brags about its operations on Telegram, where its channel has more than 60,000 followers. Many of its posts are devoted to revealing photographs, names and other biographical information about people it alleges work for Ukraine.\n\nAlex Leslie, a threat intelligence analyst at the cybersecurity company Recorded Future, told NBC News that RaHDIt, unlike some other pro-Russia hacker groups, particularly focuses on hack-and-leak operations and frequently gets coverage in Russian-language media.\n\nA history of Russian efforts\n\nUnder the new actions, all property and interests in property of the designated people that are in the U.S. or in the possession or control of Americans are blocked and must be reported to the Office of Foreign Assets Control, the Treasury Department said.\n\nThe State Department also announced three related actions, including, a new visa restriction policy imposed on individuals the administration said were acting on behalf of Kremlin-supported media organizations who use those organizations as cover for covert activities. A senior State Department official said it's also designating six RT affiliates that operate in the U.S. as \"foreign missions\" as well as offering a reward of up to $10 million for information regarding potential foreign efforts to interfere in U.S. elections.\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies have previously assessed that Russia wants to interfere in the 2024 election and flagged RT as a source of Russian propaganda and disinformation and required it to register as a foreign agent.\n\nRussia's state-controlled Russia Today (RT) television broadcast vans in Moscow in 2018. Mladen Antonov / AFP via Getty Images file\n\nRT's editor-in-chief Margarita Simonyan \u201chas close ties to top Russian Government officials\u201d and has stated publicly that \u201cthe Russian Government sets rating and viewership requirements for RT and, 'since RT receives budget from the state, it must complete tasks given by the state,'\" according to an ODNI report released publicly in 2017 following Russia\u2019s efforts in the 2016 election.\n\nThe office of the Director of National Intelligence specifically said in July that Russia is seeking to exert influence over the U.S. election to undermine support for the Democratic presidential nominee and American public support for arming Ukraine.\n\nCNN was first to report the expected sanctions.\n\nRussia was found to have interfered in the 2016 presidential election by multiple U.S. investigations, including by the team led by then-special counsel Robert Mueller. The probes determined that the efforts were intended to help Donald Trump win the election over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.\n\nIn February, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that the Biden administration had \"concerns\" about possible Russian interference in the 2024 election cycle.\n\n\u201cThis is not about politics,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cThis is about national security. It is about a foreign country, a foreign adversary, seeking to manipulate the politics and democracy of the United States of America.\u201d\n\nNBC News reported that same month that U.S. officials and cyber experts said that Russia was already disseminating disinformation using bots and fake online accounts to hurt President Joe Biden, while he was running for re-election, and other Democratic candidates.\n\nRussian outlets also helped spread misinformation about the 2020 election, but their impact was dwarfed by former President Trump\u2019s efforts to undermine the 2020 election himself.",

        "text": "6 Big Issues in the Presidential Election\nAs the presidential election heats up, a vast array of issues takes center stage. UC Davis Magazine went to experts in political science, economics, law and more for insights on what\u2019s happening now and what\u2019s at stake. Here, they answer some crucial questions for 2024.\n\nDo Mass Media Really Matter for Elections?\n\nBy Amber Boydstun, professor of political science\n\nIt\u2019s not a rhetorical question. After all, elections historically hinge mostly on economic conditions, with influential campaign media moments being the exception to the norm. Plus, more than 40% of Americans surveyed in 2024 say they are not following news about the election closely, suggesting that any media election coverage wouldn\u2019t reach them directly. And in the current splintered media environment, isn\u2019t everyone getting a different media message anyway?\n\nBut in fact, mass media \u2014 spanning from print newspapers to social media and everything in between \u2014 matter a lot. Because even though many people aren\u2019t tracking news about the election, they\u2019re still getting the news secondhand. And although the media landscape is indeed splintered, when it comes to political news, mass media tend to cover the same basic events at the same time, even if the spin is different.\n\nTake, for example, the 2023 video of Vice President Kamala Harris quoting her mother as saying, \u201cYou think you just fell out of a coconut tree? You exist in the context of all in which you live and what came before you.\u201d This video clip went viral on social media, but also was picked up and explained (perhaps mostly for older readers who don\u2019t follow social media) by traditional news outlets across the country. And the coconut meme coverage has been only a fraction of the surge in mainstream media coverage about Harris, most of it positive. It is perhaps no coincidence that Americans\u2019 positive perceptions of Harris have surged in tandem, with the percentage of Americans having a favorable opinion of Harris jumping nearly 10 points since President Biden stepped out of the race and Harris\u2019 coconut quote became a meme. As of mid-August, Harris is polling ahead of former President Trump in key swing states.\n\nThe tale of Harris\u2019 lightning-fast ascension to the Democratic nominee underscores another facet of how mass media matter: Media coverage sets the tempo for what Americans are focusing on. Consider that it was barely a month ago that former President Trump survived an assassination attempt. Yet media attention has lurched \u2014 as it always does \u2014 to the next exciting thing, with Harris\u2019 campaign now overshadowing Trump\u2019s in media coverage and in donations, at least for the moment.\n\nAnd lest we think the power of mass media in the 2024 election resides solely with social media, consider how we got to a Harris vs. Trump election in the first place. It was a presidential debate on old-school television that initiated President Biden\u2019s decision to hand his mantle to Harris. Barely 50 million viewers tuned in (down by 30 percent from Biden and Trump\u2019s first debate in 2020). But even for people who didn\u2019t watch the debate, it would have been impossible not to hear about it.\n\nBecause election news can turn on a dime, it\u2019s way too early to predict whether these examples will make the top 10 reasons to pay attention to the power of mass media in an election year. But if 2024 has shown us anything, it\u2019s that mass media matter, from the OG media of traditional journalism to the brat-green memes of TikTok.\n\nWhat Is the Potential Impact on the Supreme Court?\n\nBy Vikram Amar, distinguished professor of law\n\nMuch is potentially at stake in the 2024 federal election concerning the Supreme Court.\n\nFor starters, while perhaps none of the current nine justices is actuarially likely to die within four-plus years, many are of an age when mental or physical disability could occur quickly and force retirement, giving the next president and the next Senate one or more court vacancies.\n\nPutting aside involuntary departures, note that, by the end of the next presidential term in 2029, Justice Clarence Thomas will be 80 years old, Justice Samuel Alito 78, and Justice Sonia Sotomayor 74, making it very possible (perhaps likely) that one or more of these justices would voluntarily step down before 2029 if there were a president and a Senate of his or her preferred party. Recall that Justice Breyer voluntarily stepped down seemingly to give his seat to President Barrack Obama and the Democrats, and Justice Anthony Kennedy did the same thing for the Republicans during Donald Trump\u2019s presidency. (Recall also that many Democrats lament that Ruth Bader Ginsburg did not step down to give her seat to President Obama.)\n\nOf course replacing conservative justices with conservative justices (as Donald Trump would be expected to do) or replacing a liberal justice with a liberal justice (as Kamala Harris would be likely to do) wouldn\u2019t alter the ideological balance of the court in the short run, but it could affect the court\u2019s ideology in the longer term. For example, if Justices Thomas and Alito were replaced with younger, equally conservative justices, then the court\u2019s current six-person conservative majority would be expected to endure for a couple more decades at least, regardless of election results in 2028, 2032, 2036 and 2040.\n\nIn addition to these possible effects on court makeup, the reforms (e.g., term limits for justices, a mandatory ethical code with external enforcement, etc.) that many Democrats (and some Republicans) favor would be more or less likely ever to be enacted depending on who wins the White House and Congress.\n\nOne final point: The Supreme Court sits atop a pyramid of lower federal courts, whose makeup is very important to the nation\u2019s administration of law and whose ideological identity could be greatly affected by the upcoming election, given the large number of lower court retirements and vacancies that are sure to occur.\n\nWhat Are Elections\u2019 Effects on Consumers?\n\nBy Derek Stimel, associate professor of teaching economics\n\nElections affect consumers because elections affect the expected future path of economic policy. As policymakers, newly elected officials may enact changes to taxes, government spending, or the rules and regulations that businesses and consumers operate under. One view is that consumers desire to \u201csmooth\u201d consumption; that is, they try to avoid large swings up or down in their consumption relative to their expected long-term average income, referred to as \u201cpermanent\u201d income. For example the impact of a tax change depends on whether it is perceived as temporary or permanent by consumers. If perceived as temporary a consumer may offset it by saving more or less in order to maintain consumption; if perceived as permanent they may ultimately change their consumption level to match their new status quo. Changes in spending priorities for the government can also affect consumers because dollars spent domestically become income for someone, affecting their ability to consume. Similarly changes to regulations may affect consumer choices about their spending as well.\n\nConsumers may struggle to assess how economic policy changes arising from election results will ultimately affect their income and consumption decisions. Economic policy is a complicated and opaque mix of many different taxes, areas and mechanisms of government spending, and voluminous amounts of rules and regulations. There may be effects not just on income, but wealth, and other relevant factors like interest rates, inflation, and labor market conditions to name a few. Ultimately this can affect the sentiment of consumers, which is also thought to impact their spending decisions. One study found evidence that counties predisposed to vote for the losing party in a national election become more pessimistic about economic policy post-election. However, that study found they didn\u2019t change their consumption very much. Perhaps this shows consumers view election results as temporary changes rather than permanent as the next election is always on the horizon.\n\nWith Trump Being the Oldest Presidential Candidate, What Do We Know About His Cognition?\n\nBy Charan Ranganath, professor of psychology\n\nWe should be cautious about overgeneralizing. We know that the ability to remember recent events, or \u201cepisodic memory,\u201d gets worse on average as we get older. The decline starts in the 30s actually. But when you follow individuals, you see that the trajectories vary a lot \u2014 some \u201csuper agers\" remain solid into old age, and others decline precipitously. Also, the cause of the deficit matters \u2014 in many cases, we can\u2019t find the memories we are looking for because of changes in the functions of the prefrontal cortex, a brain area that is highly affected by healthy aging. Some people have dysfunction of the hippocampus, a brain area that is critical for forming memories in the first place, and that is often an early indicator of diseases like Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nOlder people are also vulnerable to external factors that affect memory, like sleep deprivation, physical and mental illness, and medication side effects. These are factors that can make someone appear to be demented and non-functional at some moments and perfectly lucid and high functioning at others.\n\nKeep in mind that some aspects of memory don\u2019t change much (or even improve) with age, like knowledge of relevant facts (semantic memory). We should also note that, even in the absence of dementia, there are many non-memory factors that can be important for the functioning of an elected official, some of which decline with age \u2014 like the ability to pay attention and stay on task or to quickly solve complex problems \u2014 and others which typically do not (emotional stability, compassion, morality).\n\nFinally, I hear a lot from people that they can judge a candidate\u2019s mental status because, \u201cI know what I see.\u201d That isn\u2019t necessarily true. People notice physical dexterity, verbal fluency, and attention deficits pretty quickly, but unless you know someone or do a thorough work up, you would not know that they have a memory problem. So, I think people need to ask whether a candidate\u2019s track record indicates competence, and whether the factors they see truly indicate an inability to do the job (as opposed to something like grey hair or a slow gait that triggers stereotypes about aging).\n\nHow Do We Secure our Elections?\n\nBy Matt Bishop, professor of computer science\n\nSecure elections depend upon election officials running the elections, the voting mechanisms used to record, count, and report totals, and the voters themselves, who cast the votes. Each state runs its part of the national election, and the results are combined to form the national popular and electoral votes. While all states follow broad principles, the details of how these principles are implemented among states vary.\n\nThe requirement of anonymity requires that no one, not even the voter, be able to prove how they voted. This makes auditing elections (which every jurisdiction does) difficult because one cannot contact a voter to verify their votes are recorded and cast as intended. So audits check that the systems counting the ballots did so correctly. With paper ballots or, for electronic systems, \"Voter-Verified Paper Audit Trails,\" the validation can be done manually: Select a set of ballots as required by state law, count them, and check that the result matches the recorded totals. Otherwise, one must must trust the voting systems to accurately recount the selected set of ballots.\n\nThe COVID pandemic led to the widespread adoption of mail-in voting. That has the advantage of forcing voters to mark their ballots as they intend, and physically mail the paper ballot to Election Central or hand-deliver the ballot to a voting center or polling station. The election officials check the signature on the envelope, then remove the ballot and count it. The main problem is someone being forced to vote a certain way, rather than the way they want to. At a voting center, the voter votes privately, so coercion is much harder. Except for that, the votes are as secure as the U.S. Mail (or voting centers) are.\n\nThe audit, and checking of the signatures, are examples of steps that make the entire election process as foolproof as possible. The key is the individual voter; if you do not vote, that guarantees your vote will not be counted!\n\nWhat Is Important to Rural Voters?\n\nBy Lisa Pruitt, distinguished professor of law\n\nThe selection of Tim Walz as Democratic nominee for vice president and J.D. Vance as Republican nominee for that office has led to a recent resurgence of interest in the rural vote. Each of these men \u2014 different as they are in disposition and policy positions \u2014 is a potential avatar for rural voters.\n\nRural voters were, of course, largely blamed (or credited, depending on your perspective) for the election of Trump in 2016. That is a misunderstanding in the sense that rural voters have nowhere near the electoral heft to deliver a presidential win.\n\nStill, Trump enjoyed a two-to-one advantage among rural voters in 2016, and he further consolidated the rural vote in 2020, suggesting that the rural-urban divide has \u201creplaced the North-South axis as the nation\u2019s biggest source of political friction.\u201d\n\nThe association of Trump with rural voters has caused many progressives to write off these voters as illiberal and intolerant, even racist and misogynist. But a rigorously researched book, The Rural Voter, published in 2023, reveals these voters\u2019 attitudes toward a wide range of cultural issues to be statistically indistinguishable from urban and suburban voters.\n\nA significant factor in this shift is little acknowledged \u2014 and perhaps little known: Democratic Party organizations at the national and state levels have neglected rural voters. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer summed up the thinking of much of the party\u2019s leadership in 2016 when he commented, \u201cFor every blue-collar Democrat we lose in western Pennsylvania, we will pick up two moderate Republicans in the suburbs in Philadelphia.\u201d That was in the summer of 2016, and the senator was soon proved wrong, as Hillary Clinton lost the critical swing state of Pennsylvania. A few party leaders have since worked hard to reverse course and channel resources to local rural candidates and local party organizations, but any course correction will take time.\n\nAnother misunderstanding arises from the conflation of rural voters with red-state voters. In fact, many rural voters live in \u201cblue states,\u201d including in California, where the Central Valley and far north lean Republican. Meanwhile many progressive voters live in \u201cred states\u201d \u2014 think Boise in the context of wider Idaho.\n\nNevertheless, the disproportionate power that low-population states have in both the U.S. Senate and the Electoral College has driven urban resentment of \u201crural voter.\u201d This has dramatically aggravated political polarization along the rural-urban axis. In fact, a far more consequential feature of our electoral system is the winner-take-all system by which all states (except Maine and Nebraska) allocate their electoral votes. This disenfranchises rural voters in California just as it disenfranchises urban voters in states like Idaho. A related issue is the concentration of campaign resources on close elections \u2014 on \u201cbattleground states\u201d and away from states like California.",

        "text": "Biden administration announces major actions to tackle Russian efforts to influence 2024 election\nCNN \u2014\n\nThe Biden administration announced a sweeping set of actions to tackle a major Russian government-backed effort to influence the 2024 US presidential election on Wednesday, including unveiling criminal charges against two Russian nationals, sanctions on 10 individuals and entities, and the seizure of 32 internet domains.\n\nAt Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s direction, three Russian companies used fake profiles to promote false narratives on social media, US Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said in a statement. Internal documents produced by one of those Russian companies show one of the goals of the propaganda effort was to boost the candidacy of Donald Trump or whoever emerged as the Republican nominee for president, according to an FBI affidavit.\n\nSeparately, two employees of RT, the Russian state media network, were indicted in a US court for allegedly being part of a scheme that funneled nearly $10 million to set up and direct a Tennessee-based front company to produce online content aimed at sowing divisions among Americans, according to the Justice Department. The scheme targeted millions of American news consumers with what Attorney General Merrick Garland described as \u201chidden Russian government messaging.\u201d\n\nTaken together, the actions represent the Biden administration\u2019s most significant public response yet to alleged Russian influence operations targeting American voters. After the US accused Iran of trying to hack both the Trump and Biden-Harris campaigns last month, Wednesday\u2019s actions are a reminder that US officials continue to see Russia as a prominent foreign influence threat to November\u2019s election, sources familiar with the matter said.\n\nOne of the three Russian companies allegedly behind the internet domains seized by the Justice Department is a company called Social Design Agency (SDA), which the Treasury Department previously sanctioned for allegedly running fake news sites in Europe on behalf of the Russian government.\n\nCNN first reported on the pending US actions earlier Wednesday. The Russian disinformation operation is being laundered through both Americans and non-American voices, four sources told CNN.\n\nA nearly 300-page FBI affidavit released on Wednesday describes the domain seizures and lays out a broad, Kremlin-backed effort to seed fake news stories to attack US politicians supporting Ukraine in the war against Russia and stoke tensions in US society.\n\nInternal SDA documents cited in the affidavit, which appear to date to before Trump officially clinched the Republican nomination, say one of the \u201cgoals\u201d of the company\u2019s disinformation efforts was to \u201csecure victory of a U.S. Political Party A candidate (Candidate A or one of his internal party opponents\u201d in the 2024 election.\n\nThe documents included in the affidavit do not mention Trump by name, but the US intelligence community has said that Russia\u2019s preferences for the presidential race also haven\u2019t shifted since 2020, when Moscow conducted a range of influence operations in support of Trump and aimed at denigrating Joe Biden.\n\nThe SDA documents also propose targeting US voters in six swing states with disinformation, hitting on themes such as the \u201crisk of job loss for white Americans\u201d and the purported threat of crime from \u201cUkrainian immigrants,\u201d according to the FBI affidavit.\n\nProsecutors in the indictment of two RT employees also describe an operation intended to fuel pro-Russian narratives, in part, by pushing content and news articles favoring Trump and others who the Kremlin deemed to be friendlier to its interests.\n\nThe unnamed Tennessee-based company that the Justice Department alleges was being funded by Russian operatives working as part of the Kremlin-orchestrated influence operation is Tenet Media, which is linked to right-wing commentators with millions of subscribers on YouTube and other social media platforms, according to a US official briefed on the matter.\n\nFormerly known as Russia Today, RT runs television and online platforms around the world that advance the Kremlin\u2019s agenda. The Justice Department forced RT America to register as a foreign agent in 2017 after US intelligence officials concluded that the media outlet contributed to Russian efforts to meddle in the 2016 election.\n\nWednesday\u2019s announcements mark the second major effort by the Biden administration to blunt RT\u2019s influence in as many months. In July, the Justice Department accused an RT employee of being involved in a scheme that used a network of about 1,000 social media accounts to pose as US residents to spread disinformation about the Ukraine war and other topics. US officials accuse the Kremlin of financing the scheme; a Kremlin spokesperson denied the allegation.\n\nAsked for comment, an RT spokesperson did not respond to the substance of the allegations, and instead emailed mocking comments including, \u201c2016 called and it wants its clich\u00e9s back.\u201d\n\nCNN was not immediately able to reach Social Design Agency for comment.\n\nA growing number of foreign operatives have attempted to influence US elections since Russia\u2019s 2016 activity, which included hacking the Democratic National Committee and leaking documents aimed at undercutting Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\nIn the 2024 election, Iran\u2019s alleged embrace of a similar hack-and-leak playbook that Russia used in 2016 has US officials on heightened alert. In June, a group of Iranian government-linked hackers successfully targeted the Trump campaign, stole internal campaign documents and shared them with news organizations. The hackers breached the email account of longtime Trump ally Roger Stone to target campaign staff, CNN has reported.\n\nUS officials are also keeping a close eye on China, which US officials and private experts say uses a vast set of online accounts to also target US voters. Chinese leader Xi Jinping told US President Joe Biden that China would not interfere in the 2024 US presidential election when the two men met last November, CNN previously reported.\n\nBut any foreign or domestic attempts to sow discord during the US election and shape voters\u2019 opinions don\u2019t change the fact that the voting process is very difficult to tamper with and protected by layers of defenses. There is no evidence of successful efforts \u2014 foreign or domestic \u2014to swing an American election by changing vote tallies.\n\nAn estimated 97% of registered voters in the 2024 US election will cast their ballot in a jurisdiction with a verified paper record \u2014 adding to transparency around the vote, Jen Easterly, director of the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, told reporters this week.\n\n\u201cElection infrastructure has never been more secure,\u201d Easterly said.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.",

        "text": "ABC News releases rules for Sept. 10 debate between Harris and Trump\nThe debate will be held at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia.\n\nWith less than a week until the Sept. 10 presidential debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump hosted by ABC News, the network on Wednesday released the set of rules that will govern the matchup.\n\nThe debate, which will be moderated by \"World News Tonight\" anchor and managing editor David Muir and ABC News Live \"Prime\" anchor Linsey Davis, will mark the first in-person debate between Harris and Trump and will feature 90 minutes of debate time, with two commercial breaks.\n\nThe debate will be held in Philadelphia at the National Constitution Center and will have no audience in the room.\n\nMicrophones will be live only for the candidate whose turn it is to speak and muted when the time belongs to another candidate. Only the moderators will be permitted to ask questions.\n\nA coin flip was held virtually on Tuesday to determine the podium placement and the order of closing statements; former President Trump won the coin toss and chose to select the order of statements. The former president will offer the last closing statement, and Vice President Harris selected the right podium position on screen, i.e., stage left.\n\nThere will be no opening statements, and closing statements will be two minutes per candidate.\n\nEach candidate will be allotted two minutes to answer each question with a two-minute rebuttal, and an additional minute for a follow-up, clarification, or response.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. Getty Images\n\nCandidates will stand behind podiums for the duration of the debate and no props or pre-written notes will be allowed on stage. Each candidate will be given a pen, a pad of paper, and a bottle of water.\n\nCampaign staff may not interact with candidates during commercial breaks.\n\nThe debate will be produced in conjunction with ABC station WPVI and will air live at 9 p.m. ET on the network and on the ABC News Live 24/7 streaming network, Disney+ and Hulu.\n\nABC News will also air a pre-debate special, \"Race for the White House,\" at 8 p.m. ET, anchored by chief global affairs correspondent and \"This Week\" co-anchor Martha Raddatz, chief Washington correspondent and \"This Week\" co-anchor Jonathan Karl, chief White House correspondent Mary Bruce and senior congressional correspondent Rachel Scott.\n\nAs previously announced by ABC News, to formally qualify for the debate, the participants had to meet various qualification requirements, including polling thresholds and appearing on enough state ballots to theoretically be able to get a majority of electoral votes in the presidential election.",

The Biden administration on Wednesday accused Russia of trying to influence the 2024 U.S. presidential election by targeting American voters through state-run media and other online platforms .",
        "text": "2 Russia-based RT employees indicted by US, internet domains seized in election influence probe\nThe Biden administration on Wednesday accused Russia of trying to influence the 2024 U.S. presidential election by targeting American voters through state-run media and other online platforms as part of a campaign referred to as \"doppelganger.\"\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland, speaking alongside FBI Director Christopher Wray and Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco, said prosecutors have unsealed an indictment in the Southern District of New York of \"two Russian-based employees of RT, a Russian state-controlled media outlet\" that charges them with \"conspiring to commit money laundering and to violate the Foreign Agents Registration Act.\"\n\nGarland told reporters that in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the editor-in-chief of the RT TV network \"said the company had built 'an entire empire of covert projects designed to shape public opinion in Western audiences.'\"\n\n\"We allege that as part of that effort, RT and its employees, including the defendants, implemented a nearly $10 million scheme to fund and direct a Tennessee-based company to publish and disseminate content deemed favorable to the Russian government,\" Garland said. \"To implement this scheme, the defendants directed the company to contract with U.S.-based social media influencers to share this content and their platforms. The subject matter and content of many of the videos published by the company were often consistent with Russia's interest in amplifying U.S. domestic divisions in order to weaken U.S. opposition to core Russian interests, particularly its ongoing war in Ukraine.\"\n\nIn a separate enforcement action, Garland said the DOJ has seized 32 internet domains \"that the Russian government and the Russian-sponsored actors have used to engage in a covert campaign to interfere and influence the outcome of our country's elections.\"\n\n\"As alleged in our court filings, President Vladimir Putin\u2019s inner circle, including Sergei Kiriyenko, directed Russian public relations companies to promote disinformation and state-sponsored narratives as part of a campaign to influence the 2024 U.S. presidential election,\" he said.\n\n\"These websites were designed to appear to American readers as if they were major U.S. news sites, like the Washington Post or Fox News, but in fact they were fake sites. They were filled with Russian government propaganda that had been created by the Kremlin to reduce international support for Ukraine, bolster pro-Russian policies and interests, and influence voters in the United States and in other countries. Internal documents of the Kremlin described the content as, \u2018bogus stories disguised as newsworthy events.' This malign influence campaign has been referred to as \u2018doppelganger.'\"\n\nThe DOJ also said in a statement that \"In conjunction with the domain seizures, the U.S. Treasury Department announced the designation of 10 individuals and two entities as part of a coordinated response to Russia\u2019s malign influence efforts targeting the 2024 U.S. presidential election.\"\n\nMONGOLIA IGNORES ICC DEMANDS TO ARREST PUTIN DURING STATE VISIT\n\nWhen asked by Fox News Digital about its reaction to the allegations, RT said, \"We certainly have a reaction. Actually, we had several, but we couldn't decide on one (we even thought of running an office poll), so here they are.\"\n\n\"2016 called and it wants its clich\u00e9s back,\" was among them, as were: \"Three things are certain in life: death, taxes and RT's interference in the U.S. elections,\" \"We gotta earn our Kremlin paycheck somehow,\" and \"Somewhere Secretary Clinton is sad that it's not because of her.\"\n\nRUSSIA LAUNCHES ONE OF THE DEADLIEST STRIKES AGAINST UKRAINE, KILLING 41: ZELENSKYY\n\nAsked by Fox News' David Spunt how Garland would assure the American people of the seriousness of the situation, the attorney general said: \"I'm sure [RT's response] was much funnier in the original Russia, but for us it's not funny.\"\n\n\"This is deadly serious, and we are going to treat it accordingly,\" Garland said.\n\nSpunt asked Wray what he would say to other U.S. adversaries who try to interfere in U.S. elections.\n\n\"Knock it off,\" Wray said. \"As long as adversaries keep trying to influence and interfere in our society, and our democratic processes, they're going to keep running into the FBI.\"\n\nHe continued: \"We're going to keep calling it out. And I think nations around the world have started to also see the same activity. It's not the kind of activity we would expect from nations that want to play in the first world space.\"\n\nThe Justice Department made RT register as a \"foreign agent\" in 2017. The agency said at the time that T&R Productions, LLC (T&R), a Washington, D.C., corporation, registered with the DOJ under the Foreign Agents Registration Act as an agent for ANO TV-Novosti, the Russian government entity responsible for the worldwide broadcasts of the RT Network (RT).\n\n\"Since August 2014, T&R has operated studios for RT, hired and paid all U.S.-based RT employees, and produced English-language programming for RT, which is both shown on cable networks across the United States and available on RT\u2019s website,\" it also said.\n\nPENCE URGES GOP TO UNITE BEHIND UKRAINE IN BID TO COUNTER CHINA, RUSSIA\n\nFormer Defense Intelligence Agency officer Rebekah Koffler previously told Fox News Digital that RT and other propaganda abroad were part of the permanent cyberwarfare Russia wages on the West.\n\n\"They don't just wage propaganda in a time of war, during a conflict,\" she said in 2022. \"They wage it during peacetime. They constantly malign the United States and misrepresent foreign policy objectives\u2026 I'm just saying that tilts the level playing field towards Russia when we allow their propaganda channels to broadcast in an unfettered [way].\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"RT is 100% a Russia government-controlled channel and its sole intent is to predispose the American population and wherever they are broadcasting towards the Russian point of view and to present the events on the ground as the Russians want the rest of the world to see them, so if the United States did not want that to happen then it would be appropriate to shut down the channel,\" Koffler added.",

But each set of hackers have their own methods and motives.\n\nDepartment officials said the two employees used shell companies and fake personas to pay $US10 million ($14.88 million) to an unnamed Tennessee company to produce online videos aimed at amplifying political divisions in the US.\n\nThe US Treasury and State departments also announced actions targeting RT, including the network's top editor, Margarita Simonovna Simonyan.\n\nUS officials said Russia's goal is to exacerbate internal political divisions in the US and weaken public support for American aid to Ukraine in its war with Russia.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin was aware of actions by news outlet RT to influence the 2024 US presidential election, the White House said on Wednesday.\n\n\"We believe Mr Putin was witting of these actions,\" National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said.\n\nMerrick Garland says his department \"will be relentlessly aggressive in countering attempts\" to interfere in the 2024 election. (Reuters: Anna Rose Layden)\n\nUS Attorney-General Merrick Garland said the US would be \"relentlessly aggressive\" in countering attempts from foreign actors to interfere in the 2024 election.\n\nThe FBI separately sought court permission to seize 32 internet domains it said were part of Russia's foreign influence effort.\n\nRT responded with ridicule.\n\n\"Three things are certain in life: death, taxes and RT's interference in the US elections,\" the media outlet told Reuters.\n\nThe media outlet ceased operating in the US after Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\nBeijing-based 'Green Cicada' AI network uncovered on X Photo shows twitter pic reuters A network of 5,000 accounts apparently being operated using AI has been exposed on X, formerly Twitter, with concerns the Beijing-based operation could be designed to disrupt the coming US election.\n\nA Russian politician called the reported accusations \"pure rubbish\" and said Moscow does not think it matters whether Republican Donald Trump or Democrat Kamala Harris wins the November 5 election.\n\n\"The only winner of the US election is the US private military industrial complex,\" State Duma Deputy Maria Butina told Reuters.\n\nThe Russian embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Moscow has repeatedly said it has not meddled in the US election.\n\nThe criminal indictment charged the two RT employees, Konstantin Kalashnikov and Elena Afanasyeva, with conspiracy to violate US money laundering and foreign agent laws. Both are based in Russia and remain at large.\n\nThe Tennessee company produced nearly 2,000 videos on topics like immigration and inflation that have been viewed 16 million times on YouTube since last November, according to the Justice Department.\n\nThe White House says Vladimir Putin is aware of RT's actions. (Kremlin Pool Photo via AP: Sofya Sandurskaya)\n\nIn one instance, Ms Afanasyeva told the company to provide a video that blamed Ukraine and the US for a terrorist attack on a Moscow music venue, the Justice Department said.\n\nThe indictment does not name the Tennessee company or charge any of its executives with wrongdoing.\n\nHowever, it alleges that the company failed to disclose that it was funded by RT and its executives never registered with the Justice Department that they were acting as agents of a foreign government.\n\nJustice Department officials say Russian President Vladimir Putin and his proxies have adopted increasingly sophisticated techniques, targeting specific groups of voters and those in battleground states, and are now using bot farms and artificial intelligence.\n\nReuters",

        "text": "Feds in Philly announce takedown of Russian-backed propaganda effort aimed at influencing U.S. presidential vote\nFederal authorities in Philadelphia announced on Wednesday the dismantling of a wide-ranging, Russian-backed misinformation network targeting voters in Pennsylvania and five other swing states ahead of the 2024 presidential election.\n\nThe network \u2014 known colloquially as \u201cDoppelganger\u201d and which prosecutors said was run by a top aide to Russian President Vladimir Putin \u2014 sought to dupe Americans in key demographics into believing Kremlin-produced propaganda it spread online had been produced by legitimate American news outlets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe campaign also sought to enlist the aid of unwitting influencers in America and other countries to spread disinformation, sow social media discord, and advance the campaign of former President Donald Trump, whom the program\u2019s backers viewed as more supportive of Russian interests.\n\nThe takedown of that effort \u2014 involving the seizure of more than 30 internet domains by agents from the FBI\u2019s Philadelphia field office \u2014 was just one of a sweeping series of steps President Joe Biden\u2019s administration announced Wednesday to fend off attempts by Russia to meddle ahead of November\u2019s vote.\n\nTaken together, they amounted to the most significant public response yet by U.S. authorities to Russia\u2019s alleged efforts to undermine the integrity of the election.\n\n\u201cProtecting our democratic processes from foreign malign influence is paramount to ensure public trust,\u201d U.S. Attorney Jacqueline C. Romero said in a statement detailing the Doppelganger seizures.\n\nIn Washington, the Treasury Department announced new sanctions against a Russian-based nonprofit tied to the Doppelganger network, and Attorney General Merrick Garland unveiled an indictment against two Russian employees of state-owned broadcaster RT, who he said had paid a Tennessee company to spread nearly 2,000 English-language videos supportive of Kremlin interests.\n\nCourt filings in that case and the Doppelganger seizures were careful not to specifically name the Trump campaign as an intended beneficiary of the misinformation effort, and there was no allegation that anyone in the campaign was aware of or involved in the effort.\n\n\u201cThe Justice Department will not tolerate attempts by an authoritarian regime to exploit our country\u2019s free exchange of ideas in order to covertly further its own propaganda efforts,\u201d Garland said in a statement Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe investigation,\u201d he added, \u201cis ongoing.\u201d\n\nFor months, intelligence agencies have warned that Russia remains the primary threat to the integrity of the 2024 election \u2014 despite recent headlines about efforts by other foreign governments to shape the outcome of the vote.\n\nLast month, federal authorities accused Iran of hacking Trump\u2019s campaign and attempting to breach the campaigns of Biden and Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nOfficials have also raised alarms about threats from China, which they have accused of maintaining a vast network of social media accounts aimed at targeting U.S. voters.\n\nBut ever since the U.S. was caught unprepared in the 2016 presidential election by Russia\u2019s sophisticated social media campaign to influence voters \u2014 a push that included organizing fake campaign rallies for Trump in Pennsylvania and other swing states \u2014 U.S. intelligence efforts have focused on Russia as a priority.\n\n\u00bb READ MORE: 'Paint Philly red': How Russian trolls sought to influence Pa.'s 2016 vote\n\nAn FBI affidavit unsealed Wednesday in federal court in Philadelphia outlined the Doppelganger scheme, drawing on reams of planning documents and meeting notes by Kremlin officials as they mapped out their 2024 strategy. All references in the Russian documents to specific candidates or U.S. political parties were redacted.\n\n\u201cThe conspirators specifically targeted the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania\u2019s citizens \u2026 in order to influence the electorate in this, and other districts,\u201d the affidavit said.\n\nAccording to the court filing, the effort had been overseen since at least 2022 by Sergei Kiriyenko, a former Russian prime minister and Putin\u2019s first deputy chief of staff. He and several of the entities cited in the court filings have already been subjected to U.S. sanctions for their roles in spreading misinformation.\n\nTheir primary goal, agents said, was to pass off inflammatory or fake news stories \u2014 supporting Russian interests or backing Trump \u2014 as work produced by legitimate American media outlets.\n\nPlotters registered domain names similar to those of well-known media brands \u2014 like washingtonpost.pm and foxnews.cx \u2014 and posted stories under the names of real journalists who worked for them.\n\nFor instance, investigators said, one story featured on the spoofed Washington Post website \u2014 run under the headline \u201cWhite House Miscalculated: Conflict with Ukraine Strengthens Russia\u201d \u2014 sought to diminish public sentiment for Ukraine amid Russia\u2019s ongoing invasion of the country.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for our leaders to recognize that continued support for Ukraine is a mistake,\u201d that story read. \u201cIt was a waste of lives and money. \u2026 For the sake of everyone involved in the conflict, the Biden administration should just make a peace agreement and move on.\u201d\n\nThe Doppelganger network also focused on ensuring those stories went viral, going so far as to create fake social media accounts posing as U.S. citizens to spread them and seeding the comments on other social media posts with links back to the propaganda they had posted.\n\n\u201cThe aim of the campaign,\u201d according to one Russian planning document quoted in the FBI affidavit unsealed Wednesday, \u201cis securing Russia\u2019s preferred outcome in the election.\u201d\n\nIn another planning document, Doppelganger plotters outlined a scheme they dubbed \u201cThe Good Old USA Project\u201d aimed at targeting voters from specific demographics in the U.S. with fake news and spoofed social media posts.\n\nThey included Hispanics, American Jews, conservatives, and the \u201ccommunity of American gamers, users of Reddit and image boards such as 4chan (the \u2018backbone\u2019 of right-wing trends in the U.S. segment of the internet),\u201d according to Kremlin planning documents included in Wednesday\u2019s filings.\n\n\u201cIn order for this work to be effective,\u201d it warned, \u201cyou need to use a minimum of fake news and a maximum of realistic information. At the same time, you should continuously repeat that this is what is really happening, but the official media will never tell you about it or show it to you.\u201d",

        "text": "Netanyahu Escalating Gaza War to Help Trump Win Elections, NYT's Thomas Friedman Says\nNew York Times Columnist Thomas Friedman argued that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is escalating the war in Gaza in order to help Donald Trump win the U.S. presidential election in November because Netanyahu believes a Trump presidency is the key to his own political survival.\n\nFriedman's latest opinion piece begins with an ominous warning for Vice President Kamala Harris, the democratic candidate for president: be afraid. \"Madam Vice President,\" Friedman writes, \"I have no doubt, this will lead [Netanyahu] to do things in the next two months that could seriously harm your election chances and strengthen Donald Trump's.\"\n\nFriedman then lays out what these \"things\" are: dragging out hostage negotiations, derailing any discussion of a possible two-state solution, refusing to evacuate the Philadelphi corridor, and escalating Israel's military campaign in Gaza.\n\n\"The whole thing is a fraud,\" Friedman argues, one that Netanyahu has created for the sole purpose of keeping himself alive, politically, via the U.S. presidential election.\n\nOpen gallery view U.S. Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris speaks during a campaign rally at the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) Local 5 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on Monday. Credit: AFP\n\nAccording to Friedman, Netanyahu understands the difficult position Harris is when it comes to her position on Israel. He explains: \"If Netanyahu continues the war in Gaza until 'total victory,' with more civilian casualties, he will force Harris either to publicly criticize him and lose Jewish votes or bite her tongue and lose Arab and Muslim American votes in the key state of Michigan.\"\n\n\"As Harris will likely find it hard to do either, this will make her look weak to both American Jews and American Arabs,\" he adds.\n\nOpen gallery view Israeli soldiers operate during a ground operation in the southern Gaza Strip, amid the Israel-Hamas conflict, in July. Credit: Ohad Zwigenberg/ Reuters\n\nThis would play right into Trumps' hands, Friedman argues. Netanyahu not only wants him to win, he wants to be able to tell Trump he helped him win.\n\nFrom there, Netanyahu could give himself credit for winning the war, agree to some semblance of a cease-fire to bring back hostages, if any are still alive at this point, and return to the Saudi-Israel normalization deal that was derailed on October 7.\n\nFriedman's vision of the future, were that to happen, is a bleak one. \"Netanyahu wins,\" he writes. \"Trump wins. Israel loses. Gaza will still be boiling, of course. Israeli troops will still be occupying it. Israel will be more of a pariah state than ever, with more and more talented Israelis leaving for jobs abroad.\"",

Concerned governments should push for independent verification of the electoral results and support international efforts to ensure accountability.\n\nInternational observers have raised serious concerns about the July 29 announcement by Venezuela\u2019s National Electoral Council (CNE) that Nicol\u00e1s Maduro had been re-elected president. Following the announcement, thousands of protesters have taken to the streets, in largely peaceful protests, to demand a fair counting of the votes. Human Rights Watch has documented that Venezuelan authorities and pro-government armed groups known as \u201ccolectivos\u201d have committed widespread abuses, including killings, arbitrary detention and prosecution, and harassment of critics. On September 2, a judge issued an arrest warrant against opposition candidate Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez for \u201cconspiracy,\u201d \u201cincitement to disobedience\u201d and other crimes.\n\n\u201cThe repression we are seeing in Venezuela is shockingly brutal,\u201d said Juanita Goebertus, Americas director at Human Rights Watch. \u201cConcerned governments need to take urgent steps to ensure that people are able to peacefully protest and that their vote is respected.\u201d\n\nVenezuelans voted in the presidential election in large numbers, despite irregular government actions and human rights violations in the lead-up to the election, including arrests of opposition members, arbitrary disqualifications of opposition candidates, and restrictions on Venezuelans voting abroad. Several hours after polls closed, Venezuela\u2019s electoral council declared that Maduro had won the election with over 51 percent of the vote. The Electoral Council has not released the tally sheets from the election, nor conducted the audits and citizen verification processes required by law.\n\nThe United Nations Electoral Technical Team and the Carter Center, which observed the elections, said the process lacked transparency and integrity, and questioned the declared result. They indicated that, instead, the precinct-level tally sheets that the opposition made public were reliable. The Carter Center noted that the tally sheets showed, with 81 percent of the votes counted, that Gonz\u00e1lez had won the election by a significant margin.\n\nVenezuelans have taken to the streets across the country, particularly in low-income areas traditionally supportive of the Chavismo movement, where many incidents of repression have taken place.\n\nHuman Rights Watch received credible reports of 24 killings in the context of protests from independent local groups, including Foro Penal, Justicia Encuentro y Perd\u00f3n, Monitor de V\u00edctimas, and Provea, or discovered them on social media. Human Rights Watch independently documented 11 of these cases, including by reviewing death certificates, verifying videos and photographs, and interviewing 20 people, including witnesses and other local sources. Many relatives, witnesses, and others were not willing to be interviewed because they feared government retaliation.\n\nHuman Rights Watch analyzed and verified 39 videos and 2 photographs of protests found on social media platforms or sent directly to researchers by people close to the victims, and by local organizations and journalists. Researchers confirmed the exact locations where these videos were filmed; used information such as shadows, weather patterns, and upload dates to determine the time of day; and consulted with forensic pathologists and arms experts, who analyzed the injuries and weapons that were seen and heard.\n\nAccording to Venezuelan authorities, they arrested over 2,400 people in connection with protests. The local pro bono group Foro Penal recorded over 1,580 \u201cpolitical prisoners\u201d who have been arrested since July 29, including 114 children. Prosecutors have charged hundreds with sometimes broadly defined crimes carrying harsh sentences, such as \u201cincitement to hatred,\u201d \u201cresistance to authority,\u201d and \u201cterrorism.\u201d\n\nThe government has also intensified its broader repressive tactics, cancelling passports of critics to prevent them from leaving the country, encouraging citizens to report on demonstrators, and conducting abusive raids, especially in low-income communities. On August 15, Maduro\u2019s supporters in the National Assembly passed a law that grants the government broad powers to control and shut down nongovernmental organizations.\n\nThe governments of Colombia, Brazil, and Mexico have called for talks with the Venezuelan government. On August 16, the Permanent Council of the Organization of American States, where all member states are represented, approved by consensus a resolution urging Venezuelan authorities to publish the precinct-level tally sheets and carry out an \u201cimpartial verification\u201d of the results. It also urged authorities to respect human rights.\n\nThe European Union, the US, and several Latin American and European governments have also urged Maduro to release and respect the electoral results and guarantee the rights of opposition leaders, protesters, and critics.\n\nThe prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC), Karim Khan, who is investigating crimes against humanity in the country, has said that his office is actively monitoring the situation.\n\nGovernments should support efforts to ensure accountability for grave violations in Venezuela, including by renewing the mandate of the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Venezuela (FFM) during the upcoming United Nations Human Rights Council session, Human Rights Watch said. They should also support the ongoing investigation of the Office of the Prosecutor of the ICC and consider imposing targeted sanctions on those responsible for grave violations.\n\n\n\nFor detailed recommendations and information on Human Rights Watch findings on post-electoral government repression, please see below.\n\nRecommendations\n\nForeign governments should take urgent steps to promote accountability and ensure respect for the electoral results. These include:\n\nContinue to publicly and privately call on Maduro to end human rights violations, including repression of protesters, publish the precinct-level tally sheets, allow for an independent verification of the electoral results, and respect the will of the Venezuelan people as expressed in the polls on July 28.\n\nWork multilaterally to explore rights-respecting ways to encourage Maduro\u2019s international allies, including Cuba, and the oil industry in Venezuela to call on Maduro to publish the tally-sheets, to provide for an independent process of verification of the electoral results, and to respect people\u2019s vote.\n\nRenew the mandate of the FFM, which remains key to push for accountability for widespread violations, during the upcoming session of the United Nations Human Rights Council.\n\nImpose targeted sanctions on members of the security forces, \u201ccolectivos,\u201d judges and prosecutors responsible for grave human rights violations.\n\nExpand access to asylum and other forms of international protection for Venezuelans leaving their country in line with international standards.\n\nSupport the ongoing investigation of the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court into crimes against humanity in Venezuela, and ensure that the court has the resources it needs to support work across its docket.\n\nKillings During Protests\n\nHuman Rights Watch received credible allegations that twenty-three protesters or bystanders, as well as one member of the Bolivarian National Guard (Guardia Nacional Bolivariana, GNB) security force were killed during protests, most on July 29 and 30, as the protests peaked.\n\nEight cases were reported in Caracas District, particularly in the low-income neighborhoods of El Valle and Ant\u00edmano. Six occurred during the same protests in San Jacinto, Maracay, Aragua state. The remaining cases occurred in Bol\u00edvar, Carabobo, Lara, Miranda, T\u00e1chira, Yaracuy, and Zulia states.\n\nCredible evidence gathered by Human Rights Watch implicates security forces, including the GNB and the police (Polic\u00eda Nacional Bolivariana, PNB) in some killings.\n\nIn other cases, pro-government, armed \u201ccolectivo\u201d groups appear to be responsible. \u201cColectivos\u201d have for years intimidated and harassed critics and informed on them to the government, especially in low-income neighborhoods. In 2020, the FFM found that during past protests \u201ccolectivos were in some cases involved in crowd control or violations in coordination with the state armed forces and/or upon the instruction of state political leaders.\u201d\n\nWitnesses, journalists, and human rights groups who investigated the recent protests described to Human Rights Watch how security forces and pro-government groups clamped down on protesters. Initially, security forces controlled or dispersed demonstrations, often using barricades, throwing tear gas, and arresting protesters. If the demonstrations continued, members of \u201ccolectivos\u201d showed up, often using firearms to intimidate or attack protesters.\n\nIn one apparent example of coordination between apparent \u201ccolectivo\u201d members and security forces, Human Rights Watch verified a video posted on TikTok on July 29 at 5:59 p.m. local time, in which at least three men in civilian clothes are firing handguns in the air close to fleeing protesters from behind a line of uniformed security forces making the protesters disperse. They shoot their weapons for over a minute. The security forces take no steps to stop or arrest them. Human Rights Watch geolocated the video to have been recorded on Urdaneta Avenue in Caracas.\n\nIsa\u00edas Jacob Fuenmayor Gonz\u00e1lez (Zulia State, July 29)\n\nIsa\u00edas Jacob Fuenmayor Gonz\u00e1lez, Zulia State, Venezuela. \u00a9 Private\n\nIsa\u00edas Jacob Fuenmayor Gonz\u00e1lez, 15, left his home in San Francisco, Zulia state, on the late morning of July 29 to practice a dance with his friends for an upcoming 15th birthday party, his sister told Human Rights Watch. On his way home, she said, Fuenmayor Gonz\u00e1lez joined friends who were participating in a demonstration near the Math\u00edas Lossada high school, which had served as a polling place. A video sent to researchers and verified by Human Rights Watch shows Fuenmayor Gonz\u00e1lez walking among protesters, midway from the rehearsal site and his home. The video was filmed late into the day as the light is fading to the west.\n\nA journalist who was present told Human Rights Watch that National Guard members on motorbikes repeatedly rode into the crowd to try to disperse the protest at different times during that afternoon. Human Rights Watch verified two videos that, in line with the journalist\u2019s report, show GNB members using their motorbikes to disperse protesters. By analyzing shadows, Human Rights Watch found that one of the videos, posted on X at 6:35 p.m., was recorded around 4:10 p.m. The journalist also said that some protesters threw rocks at the local office of the ruling United Socialist Party of Venezuela (Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela, PSUV), located in front of the high school.\n\nFuenmayor Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s route on July 29 in San Francisco, Zulia state, as he made his way home from a dance practice before encountering a protest and later being shot.

Graphic \u00a9 Human Rights Watch.\n\nThe journalist, local media, and human rights groups say that members of \u201ccolectivos\u201d attacked protesters after the National Guard\u2019s initial clash with demonstrators. Some time after 7:30 p.m., a bullet hit Fuenmayor Gonz\u00e1lez in the neck. Two videos filmed at night, which Human Rights Watch verified and geolocated to a corner of the Math\u00edas Lossada high school, in front of the PSUV local office, show a boy carrying a clearly injured Fuenmayor Gonz\u00e1lez to a motorcycle.\n\nHe was taken on the motorcycle to the nearby Doctor Manuel Noriega Trigo hospital, where he died. His death certificate, which Human Rights Watch reviewed, indicates that he died due to blood loss caused by a gunshot wound to his neck.\n\nImage top: Fuenmayor Gonz\u00e1lez recorded walking amongst a protest on his journey home.

As he was returning home, Garc\u00eda Ca\u00f1izalez encountered a protest near the Abigail Gonz\u00e1lez school, which had served as a polling place.\n\nOlinger Johan Monta\u00f1o L\u00f3pez, 23, a barber from El Valle, took part in the protest by the Simoncito Libertador school, according to a Facebook video geolocated by Human Rights Watch, approximately 750 meters northeast of the Abigail Gonz\u00e1lez school. Monta\u00f1o L\u00f3pez was passionate about music and sang and wrote his own songs under the artistic name \u201cSaffary,\u201d according to his posts on social media. \u201cIt is better to die in battle than to die in misery,\u201d Monta\u00f1o L\u00f3pez posted on his social media that day.\n\nHuman Rights Watch verified three videos northeast of the Abigail Gonz\u00e1lez school, around Bol\u00edvar square, that show National Guard members dispersing the protest, including by throwing tear gas or smoke canisters, and shooting kinetic impact projectiles from riot guns. In one of the videos, filmed at night, a person identifying themselves as a journalist, says that it is 7:32 p.m., which is consistent with nighttime beginning at 7:14 p.m. that day. Protesters are seen throwing what appear to be rocks at security officers, as the security officers throw what appear to be tear gas or smoke grenades, and fire unidentified types of weapons in another direction off camera.\n\nOlinger Johan Monta\u00f1o L\u00f3pez, Caracas, Venezuela. \u00a9 Private\n\nTwo videos geolocated by Human Rights Watch just two hundred meters northwest from the Abigail Gonz\u00e1lez school, filmed at night, show a group of people carrying an injured person, whom Human Rights Watch identified as Monta\u00f1o L\u00f3pez, and a group of people around another injured person on the road nearby. A video shared on social media platforms shows a shirtless man covered in blood as a group of people pick him up. Garc\u00eda Ca\u00f1izalez\u2019s aunt identified the man as her nephew. Human Rights Watch geolocated the video having been filmed in the same location as the other two videos.\n\nGarc\u00eda Ca\u00f1izalez\u2019s aunt told researchers he was shot at around 8:30 p.m. on his way home, 400 meters away. Monta\u00f1o L\u00f3pez had stopped replying to messages around 8:40 p.m., a source said.\n\nGarc\u00eda Ca\u00f1izalez died that day at the Coche Hospital. His death certificate, reviewed by Human Rights Watch, states that he was killed by massive internal hemorrhaging caused by gunshot wounds. \u201cHe was a young boy, with a zest for life, which was taken away from him,\u201d his aunt said.\n\nMonta\u00f1o L\u00f3pez was also taken to the Coche Hospital, where he died. His death certificate, which Human Rights Watch reviewed, says he died due to a penetrating thoracic trauma caused by a firearm.\n\nAn\u00edbal Jos\u00e9 Romero Salazar (Caracas District, July 29)\n\nOn July 29, An\u00edbal Jos\u00e9 Romero Salazar, a 24-year-old construction worker known by his friends as \u201cPimpina,\u201d took part in a protest in Carapita, a low-income neighborhood in Ant\u00edmano, Caracas.\n\nHuman Rights Watch verified two videos filmed in quick succession posted on X at 4:43 p.m. and 4:53 p.m. These show protesters on Intercommunal Avenue, 300 meters southwest of the Carapita Metro station, peacefully chanting and banging pots, while passing motorbikes honk their horns. In one video, a group of men are standing on a bus stop and a nearby structure.\n\nUsing weather data, Human Rights Watch confirmed that the videos were filmed after 2:30 p.m. and before they were posted. A third video posted on TikTok at 5:31 p.m. on July 29 shows hundreds of protesters by a nearby pedestrian bridge filmed that afternoon. Dozens of protesters can be seen throwing objects at several police officers in dark uniforms and others with yellow vests who are shielding themselves and running away. Other officers appear to be firing their weapons at protesters.\n\nAround 7 p.m., a bullet hit Romero Salazar on the right side of his forehead. A photograph posted on X at 7:45 p.m. on July 29 and reviewed by Human Rights Watch shows this wound. He was about 230 meters from the protesters on Intercommunal Avenue. Human Rights Watch reviewed an audio message sent by a witness to a local human rights organization.\n\nCentral image: Screenshot from a video posted at 4:53 p.m. of protesters peacefully chanting on Intercommunal Avenue.

Screenshots: Sources: Unknown. Satellite imagery: \u00a9 Airbus 2024. Google Earth. Graphic \u00a9 Human Rights Watch.\n\nThe witness, who said he was at the protest with Romero Salazar, said that when Romero Salazar was injured, police officers from the Directorate of Strategic and Tactical Actions (Direcci\u00f3n de Acciones Estrat\u00e9gicas y T\u00e1cticas, DAET) were shooting firearms at protesters near a local church. A video uploaded to TikTok and taken approximately 100 meters south from where Romero Salazar was shot, shows an armed person wearing dark clothing with white letters on his back, consistent with DAET uniforms.\n\nA video posted on YouTube on August 2 filmed from a nearby building, which Human Rights Watch verified, shows the 21 seconds before Romero Salazar was shot and some seconds following. Romero Salazar is outside the church with a group of protesters, holding what appears to be a homemade shield. A gunshot is heard, and Romero Salazar falls. Another video filmed in the same location, which was shared on X at 7:35 p.m. on July 29, shows protesters carrying a wounded Romero Salazar.\n\nThe witness, whose audio Human Rights Watch reviewed, said that police officers did not allow protesters to take Romero Salazar to the hospital. A video filmed after dark shows Romero Salazar lying wounded in the back of a truck that is not moving. Eventually protesters were able to take him to the nearby P\u00e9rez Carre\u00f1o hospital, where he died.\n\nDuring a news conference on July 31, Maduro showed a social media post that referred to Romero Salazar\u2019s death and said it was \u201cfake news.\u201d Maduro claimed that Romero Salazar had confessed that his death had been faked, and as proof, he showed a video of a man stating that his own death was simulated.\n\nHowever, Human Rights Watch has been able to establish that Maduro\u2019s claim that Romero Salazar was not dead is demonstrably false; the name used by the man in the video Maduro showed, and the location at which he claimed the incident happened, did not match Romero Salazar\u2019s case. A local organization that assisted Romero Salazar\u2019s family also confirmed that the person in the video Maduro showed is not Romero Salazar.\n\nRanc\u00e9s Daniel Yzarra Bol\u00edvar (Aragua state, July 29).\n\nRanc\u00e9s Daniel Yzarra Bol\u00edvar, Aragua State, Venezuela. \u00a9 Private\n\nRanc\u00e9s Daniel Yzarra Bol\u00edvar, a 30-year-old civil engineer who worked in a food truck, took part in protests in the San Jacinto neighborhood, in Maracay, Aragua state, on July 29. He lived in a social housing complex that had recurring power outages. A person close to Yzarra Bol\u00edvar, said that he had been hopeful about the elections and participated in the protests because of a \u201cfrustration with the lack of change.\u201d\n\nThat morning, people in San Jacinto banged pots and pans from their homes, protesting a power outage and the announced electoral result. At around 2:30 p.m., protesters took to the streets marching toward the Maracay obelisk, 200 meters from the 42nd Parachute Infantry Brigade\u2019s compound. A journalist who covered the demonstration told Human Rights Watch that it was initially peaceful, with demonstrators singing the Venezuelan national anthem and chanting.\n\nPeople approached the military compound and called for soldiers to come out and join the protest, a witness said. A soldier asked them to leave. Some left but others stayed. About half an hour later, the National Guard arrived. A video uploaded to Instagram by a journalist and verified by Human Rights Watch shows officers arriving at about 5 p.m.\n\nIn the video, officers equipped with riot gear on motorcycles, accompanied by a riot control vehicle, advance down Avenue 2 Oeste and form a blockade in front of the military compound. Protesters, some on motorcycles and others on foot, are seen chanting \u201cfreedom, freedom,\u201d peacefully, close to the entrance. Four other videos Human Rights Watch analyzed show people peacefully protesting near the entrance.\n\nA six-minute video posted on Instagram almost half-an-hour later by a journalist and analyzed by Human Rights Watch shows a cloud of smoke coming from two locations in the vicinity of the military compound. A voice off-camera says it is 5:37 p.m. and that National Guard officers are using tear gas to disperse protesters. Human Rights Watch geolocated the video to be approximately 150 meters from the compound.\n\nA journalist told Human Rights Watch that after the National Guard violently attempted to disperse protesters, some threw rocks and burned police motorcycles in retaliation. In one verified video, protesters are seen throwing Molotov cocktails in the direction of the military compound.\n\nAt approximately 6 p.m., a bullet hit Yzarra Bol\u00edvar on the left side of his chest, a person close to him said. Human Rights Watch analyzed and geolocated four videos showing Yzarra Bol\u00edvar injured and unconscious. In one verified video, taken by a journalist at 5:50 p.m. and posted 20 minutes later, two protesters are seen carrying Yzarra Bol\u00edvar to a location approximately 150 meters from the military compound. Other protesters are heard shouting \u201cthey killed him.\u201d\n\nBottom right image: A screenshot from a video shared with Human Rights Watch shows protesters waving flags.

Top right image: A screenshot from a video posted at 7:08 p.m. shows a wounded Yzarra Bol\u00edvar being carried by protesters to a white van. Source: Unknown.\n\nThe video subsequently shows three other protesters carrying him to the back of a white van, which drives away. Yzarra Bol\u00edvar\u2019s death certificate, which Human Rights Watch reviewed, says that he died of acute hemorrhagic shock due to the perforation of his thoracic organs.\n\nHuman Rights Watch received credible reports that five other people died from injuries inflicted during same protest. These are: Jes\u00fas Gregorio Tovar Perdomo, Anthony David Moya Mant\u00eda, Jes\u00fas Ram\u00f3n Medina Perdomo, Gabriel Ramos, and the National Guard officer Jos\u00e9 Antonio Torrents Blanca. Local human rights groups who documented the cases said that they all died from firearm wounds.\n\nThe Independent Forensic Expert Group (IFEG) of the International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims (IRCT) consulted by Human Rights Watch reviewed a video of Tovar Perdomo\u2019s wound, and concluded that it was caused either by a high-velocity gunshot or a gunshot at close range.\n\nThe National Survey of Hospitals, a group of healthcare workers that monitors health issues in Venezuela, reported that about 50 people injured in protests arrived at 3 hospitals in Maracay between July 29 and August 1. Human Rights Watch analyzed and geolocated four videos in which eight people can be seen bleeding from injuries or being carried by protesters. Some of the patients injured or killed had firearm wounds, the group said.\n\nTwo people close to the victims, and a witness present during the protest said that many protesters were wounded by shots coming from inside the military compound.\n\nHuman Rights Watch verified a video recorded by a local journalist who was shot in his stomach and right leg during the protests. In the video, recorded in front of the building, facing the entrance, three gunshots are heard. The camera angles then become disoriented, and background sounds suggest that the journalist has been injured. The journalist told Human Rights Watch the video was filmed at approximately 5:30 p.m.\n\nYorgenis Emiliano Leyva M\u00e9ndez (Miranda State, July 30)\n\nOn July 30, Yorgenis Emiliano Leyva M\u00e9ndez, 35, participated in protests by motorcyclists against the electoral results in Ambrosio Plaza, Miranda state. The previous day, a group of at least three unidentified men threw a Molotov cocktail in the city\u2019s main square, Plaza Bol\u00edvar. Human Rights Watch analyzed and geolocated a video of the incident.\n\nThe July 30 protest in Guarenas was largely peaceful, a media worker who covered the protest told Human Rights Watch. \u201cThe most violent thing I saw was people tearing down electoral propaganda from Maduro and burning it,\u201d they said. Human Rights Watch verified a video of the protest taken at 4 p.m., according to its caption, and posted an hour later on Instagram.\n\nThe video shows a group of people chanting peacefully and carrying flags on the Intercommunal Avenue Guarenas-Guaitare, 7.5 kilometers from Plaza Bol\u00edvar. Later, the protest moved toward Guarenas, the media worker said. Witnesses said, and a video reviewed by Human Rights Watch showed that at around 5:50 p.m. a group of people on motorbikes yelling and blaring their horns were protesting around Plaza Bol\u00edvar. In the video Leyva M\u00e9ndez is seen on a motorcycle among the group.\n\nSatellite Image: \u00a9 Airbus 2024. Google Earth. Graphic \u00a9 Human Rights Watch.\n\nThe square was guarded by municipal police and armed men whom local people described as belonging to the \u201ccolectivo\u201d Los Tupamaros, said the media worker, who covered the protest. That afternoon pro-Maduro mayor Freddy Rodr\u00edguez had published a post on Instagram saying that the \u201crevolutionary forces\u201d were \u201cactivated\u201d to \u201cdefend\u201d the city.\n\nAround 6:30 p.m., a bullet hit Leyva M\u00e9ndez near Plaza Bol\u00edvar. The death certificate, which Human Rights Watch reviewed, indicates that he suffered internal hemorrhage from a firearm wound that lacerated his femoral artery.\n\nHuman Rights Watch verified a video that shows Leyva M\u00e9ndez wounded, his clothes stained with blood, being carried by two people and placed on a motorcycle, approximately 100 meters from Plaza Bolivar, where the Mayor\u2019s Office building is located. In the video, people are heard saying that the shot came from the nearby Mayor\u2019s Office building. A journalist who covered the protest also said that people were shot from there.\n\nMass Arrests and Terrorism Charges\n\nVenezuelan authorities have reported that over 2,400 people have been arrested since July 29. The local pro bono group Foro Penal, which reported 1,580 \u201cpolitical prisoners\u201d since who have been arrested since July 29, including 114 children. At least 86 children have been released, some subject to periodic court appearances.\n\nRelatives of detainees outside the Tocuyito jail to protest against the arrests of those demonstrating against the announced presidential election results, Pocaterra, Venezuela, August 26, 2024. \u00a9 2024 Jacinto Oliveros/AP Photo\n\nMany of the arrests occurred as part of what the government calls \u201cOperation Knock Knock\u201d (Operaci\u00f3n Tun Tun). Venezuelan authorities have asked people to report on others who participate in protests or criticize the government. They have also encouraged Venezuelans to use government apps, like Ven App, to report on people. On July 31, Android and Apple app stores removed this app, but people who have downloaded them on their phones still have access to them.\n\nMaduro and Attorney General Tarek Saab have said publicly that those arrested were responsible for violent events, terrorism, and other crimes. However, Human Rights Watch repeatedly found cases of people arrested for just criticizing the government or participating in peaceful protests.\n\nProsecutors have charged hundreds with sometimes broadly defined crimes carrying harsh sentences, such as \u201cincitement to hatred,\u201d \u201cresistance to authority,\u201d and \u201cterrorism.\u201d\n\nOn the basis of interviews with local lawyers, human rights groups and others, Human Rights Watch has identified the following patterns in the arrests:\n\nDetainees are often kept in incommunicado detention, preventing contact with their families and lawyers, for weeks.\n\nMost detainees have been denied the right to be represented by a private lawyer of their choosing, even when they or their families explicitly request one.\n\nJudges and prosecutors have presented detainees at virtual hearings, often in groups. This poses significant problems for the fair administration of justice, making it hard for judges, prosecutors, and public defenders to adequately assess conditions or present evidence and arguments pertaining to each individual detainee.\n\nOther Tools to Stifle Dissent\n\nNew Legislation Restricting Civic Space\n\nOn August 15, the government-controlled National Assembly approved the Law on Oversight, Regularization, Operations, and Financing of Non-Governmental Organizations and Non-Profit Social Organizations (Ley de Fiscalizaci\u00f3n, Regularizaci\u00f3n, Actuaci\u00f3n y Financiamiento de las Organizaciones No Gubernamentales y Organizaciones Sociales Sin Fines de Lucro). Maduro has yet to sign it into law.\n\nThis law grants the government extensive control over the operation and financing of nongovernmental organizations, requiring all organizations operating in the country to register and submit detailed documents to the executive branch. The law\u2019s vague \u201cprohibitions,\u201d \u201coffenses,\u201d and established grounds to dissolve these groups severely undermine freedom of association. Additionally, the law\u2019s transitory provisions impose extremely short deadlines for compliance, threatening immediate cancellation for organizations unable to meet the requirements in time.\n\nThe National Assembly President Jorge Rodr\u00edguez said he wants the National Assembly to pass a law against \u201cfascism,\u201d a term the Maduro government has used to described critics, including peaceful protesters.\n\nPassport Cancellation\n\nSince the July 28 election, Venezuelan authorities have canceled passports of critics, political leaders, and independent journalists, in what appear to be targeted efforts to punish critics and impede them from leaving the country. The authorities have also canceled passports of people already abroad.\n\nHuman Rights Watch received information about six cases \u2013 including journalists in Venezuela and abroad and their relatives \u2013 who learned from the website of the Administrative Service for Identification, Migration, and Foreigners (Servicio Administrativo de Identificaci\u00f3n, Migraci\u00f3n y Extranjer\u00eda, SAIME), the government institution that issues passports, that their passports had been cancelled. The website did not indicate a reason.\n\nOn August 15, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights reported 36 similar cases. The total number may be higher as several human rights defenders said that they preferred not to check the status of their passport on the website, fearing that authorities could see that as suspicious.",

The Electoral Count Reform Act of 2022 clarifies the rules surrounding the certifying results in presidential elections .",
        "text": "No, local election officials can\u2019t block certification of results \u2013 there are plenty of legal safeguards\nSome local election officials have refused to certify election results in the past few years. Georgia has new administrative rules that invite election officials to investigate results before certifying. And worries abound that election officials might subvert the results of the 2024 presidential election by refusing to certify the results.\n\nWhile states may have different names or processes, certifying an election typically looks something like this: On election night, the local precincts close, and local election workers tabulate the vote; they affirm or attest that the precinct results are the proper tabulation and send those results to the county.\n\nIn a matter of days, the county election board assembles the results across all the county\u2019s precincts, tabulates them and certifies the county\u2019s result. Those results are sent to the state election board, which adds up the results from all the counties and certifies the state\u2019s winners. The governor then signs certificates of elections for the winning candidates.\n\nThere isn\u2019t one weird trick to steal a presidential election. And there are ample safeguards to ensure ballots are tabulated accurately and election results are certified in a timely manner.\n\nIt\u2019s just arithmetic\n\nCertifying an election is a rather mundane task. In law, it is often called a \u201cministerial\u201d obligation, which means it does not involve individual discretion. It is little more than making sure all precincts have reported and the arithmetic is correct. But it is an important task, because it is the formal process that determines who won the most votes.\n\nElection officials typically carry out this obligation with little fanfare. But in recent years, some election officials have questioned the election results. Some officials have wondered whether the voting machines that tabulate votes were functioning correctly, or they wanted to investigate other aspects of the election. At the certification stage, however, election officials do not have that power.\n\nIf there are major questions about the election, the power to investigate them lies elsewhere. Other election officials verify absentee ballot signatures or calibrate ballot tabulation machines well before the election, a task typically open to public viewing.\n\nA losing candidate might file an election contest in court to challenge the results of the election, and a court can take evidence and hear the legal dispute. Certification, in contrast, is a simple and ministerial task.\n\nCourts can step in\n\nIf an election official or board refuses to certify an election, that refusal does not last long. After some refusals in recent years, election officials learned of the legal consequences for failing to perform their obligations, including being removed from office and facing criminal prosecution. Most officials quickly relented and ended up certifying. And none of the delays in certification ever lasted long enough to miss deadlines set by state law for certification.\n\nIf election officials still refuse to do their job, they can be sued in court. The secretary of state might sue to ensure officials complete the tasks required for election administration. Or a winning candidate might sue to ensure that he or she receives a certification of election.\n\nIn 2022, for instance, after an election board refused to certify the results in Otero County, New Mexico, the secretary of state filed a lawsuit in the New Mexico Supreme Court. In just one day, the court ordered the board to certify the election. The board did.\n\nBut these elections were not presidential elections, and the stakes are high as 2024\u2019s election approaches. What if election officials refuse to certify results \u2013 and, worse still, defy courts that order them to certify results?\n\nThe law is prepared for that, too.\n\nIf a party refuses to comply with a court order, the court can order someone else to perform it, and it is given the same legal effect. A court can quickly and easily ensure election results are certified in a timely fashion.\n\nFor those worrying about the 2024 presidential election, there are even more safeguards. Congress enacted the Electoral Count Reform Act of 2022. The act clarifies the rules surrounding the certifying of results in presidential elections and the counting of electoral votes in Congress.\n\nFor instance, the act requires state officials to finish the certification of election results by \u201cthe second Wednesday of December,\u201d which is Dec. 11 this year. Courts can ensure that election officials who may be dragging their feet will comply with this federally mandated deadline.\n\nRead more: Congress passes legislation that will close off presidential election mischief and help avoid another Jan. 6\n\nAnd if officials miss that deadline, the act anticipates that a court may be asked to step in. The act instructs Congress to give full effect to any certification of election results issued by a court, even if it\u2019s after the Dec. 11 deadline.\n\nGood faith and respect\n\nIn short, the legal system is built to handle election officials who delay certification or refuse to certify results. No single election official or group of them can stymie an election.\n\nOf course, the refusal to certify an election can still have consequences. It can sow confusion and discord among the public. It can undermine people\u2019s faith in elections and call into question the results when there are no reasonable grounds to dispute the outcome.\n\nThose political and practical concerns are serious, and it is important for the public and election officials to act in good faith and to respect the legal process as it plays out.\n\nBut such rhetoric will not prevent the election of a winning candidate.",

        "text": "Attorney General Merrick B. Garland Delivers Remarks at the Convening of the Election Threats Task Force\nRemarks as Delivered\n\nGood afternoon, everyone.\n\nWe launched the Election Threats Task Force to respond to a dangerous increase in violent threats against the public servants who administer our elections.\n\nWe did so because countless Americans were enduring terrible threats simply for doing their civic duty.\n\nAnd we did so because threats to election workers constitute threats to our democracy itself.\n\nIn just a few minutes, the Task Force here will meet to discuss its continuing work in advance of the upcoming elections.\n\nBut before we begin, I want to address the tragic shooting that occurred this morning at a high school in Winder, Georgia.\n\nWe are still gathering information, but FBI and ATF are on the scene working with state, local, and federal partners.\n\nI am devastated for the families who have been affected by this terrible tragedy.\n\nThe Justice Department stands ready to provide any resources or support the Winder community needs in the days ahead.\n\nBefore I get to the work of the Task Force, I also want to announce two major law enforcement actions the Justice Department is taking that are separate from the important work of this Task Force, but are part of our broader effort to protect our elections from unlawful interference of any kind.\n\nFirst, this morning, we unsealed an indictment in the Southern District of New York of Konstantine Kalashnikov and Elena Afanasyeva, two Russia-based employees of RT, a Russian state-controlled media outlet. They are charged with conspiring to commit money laundering and to violate the Foreign Agents Registration Act.\n\nThat law, enacted nearly a century ago, was enacted to ensure that the American people were informed when a foreign power engages in political activities or seeks to influence public discourse.\n\nThe American people are entitled to know when a foreign power is attempting to exploit our country\u2019s free exchange of ideas in order to send around its own propaganda. The company never disclosed to the \u2014 I\u2019m sorry.\n\nAnd that is what we allege happened in this case.\n\nIn the wake of Russia\u2019s brutal invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, RT \u2014 which was then known as Russia Today \u2014 was dropped by its American distributors. The company ceased its formal operations in the United States. And the European Union, the U.K., and Canada banned RT\u2019s broadcasting.\n\nBut, as RT itself has boasted, the Government of Russia continued to use RT to direct disinformation and propaganda. In the wake of Russia\u2019s brutal invasion of Ukraine, RT\u2019s editor-in-chief said the company had built an \u201centire empire of covert projects\u201d designed to shape public opinion in \u201cWestern audiences.\u201d\n\nWe allege that, as part of that effort, RT and its employees, including the defendants, implemented a nearly $10 million scheme to fund and direct a Tennessee-based company, to publish and disseminate content deemed favorable to the Russian government.\n\nTo implement this scheme, the defendants directed the company to contract with U.S.-based social media influencers to share this content on their platforms.\n\nThe subject matter and content of many of the videos published by the company were often consistent with Russia\u2019s interest in amplifying U.S. domestic divisions in order to weaken U.S. opposition to core Russian interests, particularly its ongoing war in Ukraine.\n\nThe company never disclosed to the influencers \u2014 or to their millions of followers \u2014 its ties to RT and the Russian government. Instead, the defendants and the company claimed that the company was sponsored by a private investor. That private investor was a fictitious persona.\n\nThe charges unsealed this morning do not represent the end of the investigation. It remains active and ongoing.\n\nIn a separate enforcement action, the Justice Department is seizing 32 internet domains that the Russian government and Russian sponsored actors have used to engage in a covert campaign to interfere in and influence the outcome of our country\u2019s elections.\n\nAs alleged in our court filings, President Vladimir Putin\u2019s inner circle, including Sergei Kiriyenko, directed Russian public relations companies to promote disinformation and state-sponsored narratives as part of a program to influence the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election.\n\nAn internal planning document created by the Kremlin states that a goal of the campaign is securing Russia\u2019s preferred outcome in the election.\n\nThe online infrastructure used by the Russian public relations company \u2014 known as the Social Design Agency, or SDA \u2014 and related actors included what are sometimes referred to as \u201ccybersquatted\u201d domains. These websites were designed to appear to American readers as if they were major U.S. news sites like The Washington Post or Fox News.\n\nBut, in fact, they were fake sites. They were filled with Russian government propaganda that had been created by the Kremlin to reduce international support for Ukraine, bolster pro-Russian policies and interests, and influence voters in the United States and other in countries.\n\nInternal documents of the Kremlin described the content as, \u201cbogus stories disguised as newsworthy events.\u201d This malign influence campaign has been referred to as \u201cDoppelganger.\u201d\n\nThe Russian public relations companies drove viewers to these websites by deploying influencers and paid social media advertisements. They also created fake social media profiles, posing as U.S. citizens, to post comments on social media platforms with links to the sites.\n\nAccording to SDA\u2019s records, it actively sought to \u201celiminate the possibility of detection of the \u2018Russian footprint.\u2019\u201d\n\nBoth of the schemes I have just discussed make clear the ends to which the Russian government \u2014 including at its highest levels \u2014 is willing to go to undermine our democratic process.\n\nBut the enforcement actions I have discussed also make clear that the Justice Department will aggressively counter such efforts.\n\nAnd the same is true of the entire United States Government.\n\nToday, our colleagues at the State and Treasury Departments are announcing parallel actions in both of these matters.\n\nUnfortunately, we know that Russia is not the only foreign power seeking to interfere in our elections.\n\nAs the U.S. Intelligence Community noted two weeks ago, we have observed increasingly aggressive Iranian activity during this election cycle.\n\nThat includes recently reported activities by Iran to compromise former President Trump\u2019s campaign and to avoid an election outcome that it regards as against its interests. Those recently reported Iranian activities also include efforts to obtain access to individuals who themselves have access to the presidential campaigns of both political parties.\n\nThe Justice Department\u2019s message is clear: we have no tolerance for attempts by authoritarian regimes to exploit our democratic system of government.\n\nWe will be relentlessly aggressive in countering and disrupting attempts by Russia and Iran \u2014 as well as China or any other foreign malign actor \u2014 to interfere in our elections and undermine our democracy.\n\nNow, I will to turn back to the topic of today\u2019s meeting. Just as we are dedicated to combating foreign threats to our election security, we are equally dedicated to confront domestic threats against the public servants who administer our elections.\n\nSince the 2020 election, we have seen an unprecedented spike in threats against the public servants who do administer our elections.\n\nElection officials, workers, and volunteers in communities across the country have been targeted with heinous acts and threats of violence. The following are a few examples of successful enforcement actions that the Justice Department has taken over the past year:\n\nIn New Mexico, county commissioners and other elected officials were targeted with a series of shootings that the Department has alleged in court papers were organized by an unsuccessful candidate for the state legislature who claimed that the election had been \u201crigged\u201d against him. At least three of the shootings occurred while the intended victims or their children or their family members were at home.\n\nIn February, two shooters who we allege were recruited by the candidate pled guilty to carrying out the attacks. In March, the candidate himself was charged in a 13-count superseding indictment.\n\nIn Arizona, a man sent a state election official a bomb threat warning that if she did not resign within two days, \u201cthe explosive device impacted in her personal space will be detonated.\u201d In March, the man was sentenced to three and a half years in prison for making the threat.\n\nIn Maricopa County, Arizona, an elections official, a county attorney, and their families were threatened by a defendant who called for \"a mass shooting of poll workers and election officials\u201d in precincts he believed had \u201csuspect\u201d results. His revolting comments included: \u201cdead children burn into the memories of people.\u201d\n\nThe county attorney who had been targeted later reported that he, his wife, and four children had been assigned round-the-clock protection and issued body armor in response to the threat.\n\nAnd the elections official who was targeted said in a victim impact statement that:\n\n\u201cWhile I am the person directly threatened [in] this case, the impact of such threats is felt by a much larger community: the thousands of committed election workers who operate our democratic processes. When threats are made against any election workers, the impact reverberates [through] the [whole] community.\u201d\n\nThat defendant was sentenced to three and a half years in prison.\n\nIn recent months, our enforcement actions have continued.\n\nIn July, we secured the guilty plea of an Alabama man who repeatedly threatened to kill Maricopa County election workers and officials. In one particularly chilling message, he said: \u201cYou better not come in my church, my business or send your kids to my school. You are [\u2026] stupid if you think [your lives] are safe.\u201d His sentencing is scheduled for next month.\n\nAlso in July, the Justice Department secured a 14-month sentence for a man who sent a death threat to a Michigan election worker. In a voicemail, he said: \u201cTen million plus patriots will surround you when you least expect it.\u201d And he added, \u201cWe\u2019ll [\u2026] kill you.\u201d\n\nLess than two weeks ago, we charged and arrested a Colorado man for allegedly threatening the lives of election officials, judges, and law enforcement officials in both Colorado and Arizona.\n\nAs I have said before, and I will reiterate again today, these cases are a warning: if you threaten to harm or kill an election worker or official or volunteer, the Justice Department will find you. And we will hold you accountable.\n\nIn a democracy, people vote and argue and debate \u2014 often loudly \u2014 in order to achieve the policy outcomes they desire.\n\nAnd the Justice Department will continue to relentlessly protect the rights of all Americans to peacefully express their opinions, beliefs, and ideas.\n\nBut the promise of our democracy is that people will not employ violence to achieve their preferred outcomes.\n\nThe public servants who administer our elections must be able to do their jobs without fearing for their lives.\n\nThat is why this Task Force has been marshaling the full resources of the Justice Department to aggressively investigate and prosecute threats targeting election workers, officials, and volunteers.\n\nAnd we will continue to do so in the months ahead, when the Task Force will build on the partnerships with state and local election officials and the law enforcement officials tasked with protecting them.\n\nSince March, the Task Force has participated in more than 25 convenings, engagements, trainings, tabletop exercises \u2014 including both with our law enforcement partners and with our partners in the election community nationwide.\n\nOver the next several weeks, Task Force representatives will be on the ground meeting with election workers.\n\nAnd in early November \u2014 both in advance of, and after Election Day \u2014 the FBI will be hosting federal partners at its Headquarters command center to address events, issues, and potential crimes related to the elections in real time.\n\nElection officials and administrators do not need to navigate this threat environment alone. We are here to support them and to make sure they can safely carry out their critical work.\n\nProtecting our democracy and protecting our elections was a founding purpose when the Justice Department was established in 1870.\n\nThe Department answered that charge then. And we will answer that charge today as we confront those who would use violence or threats of violence to attack those who administer our elections.\n\nI\u2019d now like to ask the Deputy Attorney General to make some remarks.",

She cast the tie-breaking vote on the Inflation Reduction Act, which invested billions to tackle climate change and invest in clean energy.\n\nHarris has defended her shifting policy on fracking, which she opposed in her 2019 Democratic campaign for president.\n\n\"What I have seen is that we can grow, and we can increase a clean energy economy without banning fracking,\" she said in an interview with CNN, vowing as president she would not ban fracking.\n\nShe's said as president she would \"unite Americans to tackle the climate crisis as she builds on this historic work, advances environmental justice, protects public lands and public health, increases resilience to climate disasters, lowers household energy costs, creates millions of new jobs, and continues to hold polluters accountable to secure clean air and water for all.\"\n\nDonald Trump\n\nTrump previously falsely dismissed climate change as a \"hoax\" or \"nonexistent.\"\n\nHe's also repeatedly downplayed the dangers of rising sea levels and referred to proposed regulations to mitigate global warming as \"radical.\"\n\nThroughout his presidency, Trump reversed many American commitments to mitigating climate change, most notably withdrawing from the Paris agreement, removing clean water and air pollution protections and seeking to fast track environmental reviews of dozens of major energy and infrastructure projects, such as drilling and fuel pipelines, which he said would help boost American energy production and the economy.\n\nStill, Trump also labels himself a champion of the environment, emphasizing the importance of clean water and clean air.",

        "text": "Kamala Harris will win election, predicts leading historian Allan Lichtman\nAllan Lichtman, the historian dubbed the \u201cNostradamus\u201d of US presidential elections, has predicted that Kamala Harris will win the White House in November\u2019s poll.\n\nHaving previously warned the Democrats of the dangers of removing Joe Biden from the ticket, Lichtman nevertheless forecast that the vice-president, who became the party\u2019s nominee after the president withdrew in July, would be elected in a video for the New York Times.\n\nHe said Harris was on course to beat Donald Trump even though the Democrats had effectively surrendered the valuable key of presidential incumbency, one of 13 he used to determine the likely outcome.\n\n\u201cKamala Harris will be the next president of the United States \u2013 at least that\u2019s my prediction for the outcome of this race,\u201d Lichtman, 77, says at the conclusion of the quirky seven-minute video, which features him running in a track athlete\u2019s garb, against other elderly competitors in a qualifying race for the 2025 national senior Olympics.\n\n\u201cBut the outcome is up to you. So get out and vote.\u201d\n\nLichtman\u2019s predictions are based on a set of true/false propositions, and take no account of polling trends.\n\nHe previously vociferously argued against replacing Biden as Democratic nominee after his disastrous debate performance against the former president in June and dismissed the validity of opinion polls indicating it had damaged Biden\u2019s ability to win the race.\n\nView image in fullscreen Allan Lichtman in his office in Washington DC in 2012. Photograph: Paul J Richards/AFP via Getty Images\n\nNevertheless, of 13 keys, he found eight favoured Harris \u2013 who he said gained from the absence of a strong third party candidate following the demise of Robert F Kennedy Jr\u2019s independent campaign, positive short- and long-term economic indicators, major legislative achievements enacted by the Biden administration, and absence of social unrest or scandal attached to the White House. She was also favoured in not having had to undergo a party nomination battle to succeed Biden, as other mooted candidates quickly lined up to endorse her before last month\u2019s Democratic national convention.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Stakes \u2014 Presidential Transition Free newsletter We will guide you through the aftermath of the US election and the transition to a Trump presidency Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He also correctly forecast that Trump would be impeached during his presidency \u2013 which he was, twice.\n\nA history professor at American University, he has been forecasting the results of US presidential elections since 1984 and claims to have accurately predicted all but one \u2013 George W Bush\u2019s contested triumph over Al Gore in 2000, which was decided after the US supreme court ruled in Bush\u2019s favour following weeks of legal wrangling over disputed ballots.\n\nLichtman claims even that blemish is unjustified, arguing that thousands of disallowed ballots had been cast by voters who had tried in good faith to back Gore, the then vice-president and Democratic candidate, but had inadvertently spoilt their ballot papers.",

        "text": "Allan Lichtman Is Very Comfortable About Predicting the 2024 Election\nAmerican University professor Allan Lichtman released his quadrennial prediction for the presidential election Thursday via a snappy New York Times video that called him the \u201cProphet of Presidential Elections.\u201d That\u2019s because Lichtman, by way of his system of 13 questions, or \u201ckeys,\u201d that determine his call, has correctly called every election except 2000\u2019s, which was admittedly an odd one. This year, he expects Kamala Harris to win. Lichtman spoke to us via phone from the university.\n\nI wanted to start by apologizing to you: We\u2019ve never had you in our Style Setters issue, despite you having some of the best neckties in Washington.\n\nHa! Thank you. I owe that to my wife.\n\nHow long does your prediction process take? Do you work on it all at once, or is it a rolling process?\n\nI do it throughout the four years. Sometimes the keys fall into place early. For example, my first prediction was of Ronald Reagan\u2019s reelection in your magazine in April 1982, almost three years ahead of time, when America was in the grip of the worst recession to date since the Great Depression, when 60 percent of Americans said Ronald Reagan was too old to run again, and his approval rating was historically low. But the keys had fallen into place. I called the hard-to-call 2012 Obama reelection in 2010. But recently, probably because of the extreme polarization, the keys have fallen into place late.\n\nIf something were to change radically between now and November, is it possible that there could be a change in your production?\n\nI mean, yeah, something absolutely catastrophic, unexpected can always happen. This idea of an October surprise is a big myth. I\u2019ve always predicted my calls before that. But the two keys that could shift are the two foreign-policy keys: foreign military failure, foreign military success. Possibly, maybe, it\u2019s unlikely you could get a ceasefire and hostage release, but it doesn\u2019t matter. Even if both of those foreign military keys went against the White House party, they\u2019re still only down a total of five keys. It takes six negative keys to predict their defeat.\n\nDo the keys take the Electoral College into account? Or do they predict the popular vote?\n\nYou know, for most of our history, the two coincided, except there was a couple of exceptions as a result of strange things happening during Reconstruction and the transition to the so-called white-supremacist \u201cRedeemer\u201d governments. But in recent years, the popular vote has become irrelevant, because the Democrats pile up so many millions of extra votes in New York and California alone, which count for nothing in the Electoral College. That\u2019s why in 2016, 2020, 2024, I just called the winners. There\u2019s no point in looking at the popular vote. In fact, since 1992, you know how many times the Republicans have won the popular vote? Once, way back in 2004, narrowly.\n\nBut they have an advantage in the Electoral College, even though I\u2019ve read an argument that it\u2019s shrinking.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to say. All of these swing-state polls are very unreliable. Of course, they\u2019re small samples and the error margins are bigger than the margins between the candidates. The pollsters tell you their error margin is about plus and minus 3 percent. That\u2019s pure statistical error. That\u2019s the error you would get if you had a huge jar of green and red balls and you took a sample and estimated the percentage of green and red balls. But human beings are not red and green balls. Most of us don\u2019t respond to pollsters. In 2016, the pollsters underestimated Republican voting strength. So, like generals fighting the last war, they tried to correct it. And recently, they\u2019ve been underestimating Democratic voting strength. For example, in the marquee special election of 2024, to the seat previously held by the disgraced George Santos, the New York congressional seat, a poll taken right before the election had the Democrat up by one point. He won by eight points, exceeding the poll numbers by seven points.\n\nDo you expect a similar overperformance by Democrats this November?\n\nI do. I mean, you never know. But it would indicate that the polls are underestimating, based on actual election results, underestimating Democratic strength, just as they had previously underestimated Republican strength.\n\nSo your keys are an attempt to assert some fundamentals that outperform poll data?\n\nThat\u2019s right. The keys tap into how presidential elections really work as votes up or down on the strength and performance of the White House party. And because I have 13 keys, I have a very wide range of indicators that help predict whether the voters are going to give the White House party four more years or not. The pundits have no scientific basis to their prognostications.\n\nWhen I was preparing for this, I read some of those pundits, and some of them had argued that your keys are subjective, like the charisma one. I imagine you have a retort to that.\n\nDo I ever. When I first developed the keys, the professional forecasters blasted me. I had committed the cardinal sin of subjectivity. And I explained the keys are not subjective. They\u2019re judgmental. And historians make judgments all the time. Moreover, each key is very specifically defined in my book. And I\u2019ve answered each question, each key, from 1860 on, so there\u2019s a whole record that you have to be consistent with.\n\nNow, you say something like charisma. Yeah, it may seem subjective, but it\u2019s not. I define the key as one of those once-in-a-generation inspirational candidates who broadly appeals across party lines. Since 1900, the only ones who qualify are Teddy Roosevelt, Franklin Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan, and Barack Obama. And Eisenhower qualifies because he was a national hero. And guess what? Except for Kennedy, who died in office, every one of them got a second term. Whereas more than half of the Presidents who didn\u2019t meet the key lost for a second term: William Howard Taft, Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush, Herbert Hoover, Donald Trump.\n\nTrump\u2019s not charismatic? He brought a lot of new voters into politics.\n\nI did not give Trump the key in 2016 or 2020 or 2024 because he doesn\u2019t fit the model of a broadly appealing candidate. He appeals to a narrow base. His approval rating as President averaged 41 percent, one of the lowest ever in history. He lost two elections by a combined 10 million popular votes. Franklin Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan won elections with overwhelming landslides. So while you may think he\u2019s a great showman, and maybe he is, that doesn\u2019t matter: He doesn\u2019t fit the definition of the keys of being broadly inspirational and building a cross-party coalition.\n\nYou argued earlier this summer that it was a mistake to drop Joe Biden from the ticket. How would he fare under the keys model? Would your prediction have changed if you were still the candidate?\n\nI don\u2019t answer hypotheticals. But let me say this: I was very critical of the Democrats for a couple of reasons. One, I thought it was just a horrible strategy to be openly and publicly trashing your sitting President and the candidate overwhelmingly voted on by the voters. Plus, I thought they were going to sacrifice two keys: It looked like they\u2019d lose the incumbency key, obviously, and it looked like they were barreling toward a big party brawl, and they\u2019d lose a second key, the contest key, which would put them in a very difficult position to gain reelection. But they got smart all of a sudden and grew a spine all of a sudden and united behind Harris, which saved the contest key. That meant they only lost one key. Plus, it turns out Harris probably has a positive effect on two other keys, the third-party key. With Harris in the race, voters didn\u2019t have to choose between two old white guys. I hate to say that, being an old white guy myself, but we saw the fizzling of the RFK Jr. campaign. And she may have dampened social unrest because Biden is no longer front and center, the guy responsible for policies against which the protesters disagreed.\n\nI know you have a lot more reporters to talk to today, but can I get on your calendar now to chat in 2028?\n\nIf I\u2019m still around. I\u2019m 77, so God forbid. [Laughs.]\n\nJoin the conversation!",

        "text": "Right-wing influencers were duped to work for covert Russian operation, US says\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 They have millions of followers online. They have been major players in right-wing political discourse since Donald Trump was president. And they worked unknowingly for a company that was a front for a Russian influence operation, U.S. prosecutors say.\n\nAn indictment filed Wednesday alleges a media company linked to six conservative influencers \u2014 including well-known personalities Tim Pool, Dave Rubin and Benny Johnson \u2014 was secretly funded by Russian state media employees to churn out English-language videos that were \u201coften consistent\u201d with the Kremlin\u2019s \u201cinterest in amplifying U.S. domestic divisions in order to weaken U.S. opposition\u201d to Russian interests, like its war in Ukraine.\n\nIn addition to marking the third straight presidential election in which U.S. authorities have unveiled politically charged details about Russia\u2019s attempted interference in U.S. politics, an indictment indicates how Moscow may be attempting to capitalize on the skyrocketing popularity of right-wing podcasters, livestreamers and other content creators who have found successful careers on social media in the years since Trump was in office.\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department doesn\u2019t allege any wrongdoing by the influencers, some of whom it says were given false information about the source of the company\u2019s funding. Instead, it accuses two employees of RT, a Russian state media company, of funneling nearly $10 million to a Tennessee-based content creation company for Russia-friendly content.\n\nAfter the indictments were announced, both Pool and Johnson issued statements on social media, which Rubin retweeted, saying they were victims of the alleged crimes and had done nothing wrong.\n\nWhat to know about Trump\u2019s second term:\n\nStaffing the administration: Here are the people Trump has picked recess appointments Follow all of our coverage as Donald Trump assembles his second administration.\n\n\u201cWe still do not know what is true as these are only allegations,\u201d Pool said. \u201cPutin is a scumbag.\u201d\n\nIn his post, Johnson wrote that he had been asked a year ago to provide content to a \u201cmedia startup.\u201d He said his lawyers negotiated a \u201cstandard, arms length deal, which was later terminated.\u201d\n\nKostiantyn Kalashnikov and Elena Afanasyeva are charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering and violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act. They are at large, and it was not immediately clear if they had lawyers.\n\nU.S. officials have previously warned of Russia\u2019s use of unwitting Americans to further influence operations in the 2024 election, but Wednesday\u2019s indictment is the most detailed description of those efforts to date.\n\nAt a forum on Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin appeared to suggest jokingly that he would support Vice President Kamala Harris in the upcoming U.S. election. Intelligence officials have said Moscow has a preference for Trump.\n\nPutin authorized influence operations to help Trump in the 2020 election, while his 2016 campaign benefited from hacking by Russian intelligence officers and a covert social media effort, according to U.S. law enforcement and intelligence officials.\n\nWith the decline of traditional media like newspapers and limits on direct advertising on social media platforms, influencers are increasingly playing a key role in politics and shaping public opinion. Both the Republican and Democratic parties invited scores of influencers to their respective national conventions this summer. But with little to no disclosure requirements about who is funding influencers\u2019 work, the public is largely in the dark about who is powering the messaging online.\n\nThough the indictment does not name the Tennessee-based company, the details match up exactly with Tenet Media, an online media company that boasts of hosting \u201ca network of heterodox commentators that focus on Western political and cultural issues.\u201d Tenet\u2019s website lists six influencers who provide content, including Pool, Johnson, Rubin, Lauren Southern, Tayler Hansen and Matt Christiansen.\n\nTenet Media\u2019s six main influencers have more than 7 million subscribers on YouTube and more than 7 million followers on X.\n\nFueled by public outrage and online fandom, the influencers who make up the bench of talent at Tenet Media have amassed millions of loyal followers who agree with their staunch conservatism and brazen willingness to voice controversial opinions. Their channels also have created communities for conservative Americans who have lost trust in mainstream media sources through Trump\u2019s 2020 loss and the COVID-19 pandemic. Several of them have faced criticism for spreading political misinformation.\n\nThe indictment shows that some of the influencers were paid handsomely for their work. One unidentified influencer\u2019s contract included a $400,000 monthly fee, a $100,000 signing bonus and an additional performance bonus.\n\nTenet Media\u2019s shows in recent months have featured high-profile conservative guests, including Republican National Committee co-chair Lara Trump, former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy and U.S. Senate candidate Kari Lake. The nearly 2,000 videos posted by the company have gotten more than 16 million views on YouTube alone, prosecutors said.\n\nPool, a journalist-turned-YouTuber who first gained public attention for livestreaming the Occupy Wall Street protests, hosted Trump on his podcast earlier this year.\n\nJohnson is an outspoken Trump supporter and internet personality who was fired from BuzzFeed after the company found evidence he\u2019d plagiarized other works.\n\nRubin was previously part of the liberal news commentary show \u201cThe Young Turks\u201d but has since identified as a libertarian. He boasts the largest YouTube following of Tenet\u2019s influencer roster and hosts a show called \u201cThe Rubin Report.\u201d\n\nTenet Media President Liam Donovan is the husband of Lauren Chen, a Canadian influencer who has appeared as a guest in several Tenet Media videos. Chen is affiliated with the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA and has hosted shows for the right-wing network Blaze Media. RT\u2019s website also lists her as a contributor of several opinion articles from 2021 and 2022.\n\n___\n\nSuderman reported from Richmond, Virginia.

        "text": "Impact of US election on the war\nRussia has expended considerable resources to advance in Donetsk, probably assuming that a Trump administration would let it keep its gains\n\nA Harris win is likely to prolong the war, but also to speed up the weakening of key institutional ties on which Putin\u2019s rule depends\n\nThe outcome of the 2024 US presidential election in November will almost certainly have a significant, and potentially decisive, impact on the trajectory of the Russia-Ukraine war. It looks as though the policies of the two main candidates on military aid for Ukraine and transatlantic security diverge starkly. A victory for former president Donald Trump would probably lead to a reduction in US commitment on both fronts, benefiting Russia. A victory for the US vice-president, Kamala Harris, would probably mean continued US backing for Ukraine, prolonging the war, but potentially weakening Putin\u2019s regime.\n\nUS military aid has been crucial for Ukraine\u2019s survival\n\nThe US has contributed considerably more military aid to Ukraine than any other country since the onset of Russia\u2019s invasion. By the end of June, US military aid already allocated to Ukraine came to $55.5 billion, according to the Kiel Institute. That is close to half the total delivered by all of Ukraine\u2019s international backers. The military equipment that Washington has provided to Ukraine has helped Kyiv maintain an operational edge against the much larger Russian military. And Javelin portable anti-tank missiles, for example, were vital in the defence of Kyiv early on in the invasion.\n\nCurrent funding pledges to Ukraine from the US, the G7 and NATO should cover Ukraine\u2019s budget and military needs in 2025. But any weakening of US support would hinder Kyiv\u2019s ability to sustain the fight beyond that. The capacity of European countries to offset a potential reduction in US military funding would probably be constrained, in our assessment. This is not least because of the rising fortunes of political parties in Europe that oppose aiding Ukraine.\n\nThe outcome of the 2024 US presidential election in November will therefore be a crucial driver \u2013 and hence indicator \u2013 for the trajectory of the war over 2025 at least.\n\nTrump would probably shift US foreign policy\n\nA Trump victory would probably favour Russia and deliver a significant blow to Ukraine. Moscow has been conducting a costly, grinding advance in Ukraine\u2019s Donetsk region since late 2023, persisting with this even following Ukraine\u2019s surprise August offensive into the Kursk region of southern Russia. In our analysis, the Kremlin\u2019s perseverance is partly because it expects that Trump will secure reelection and that this could lead to a peace deal in which Russia is allowed to retain the territories it occupies.\n\nThat expectation is not without basis. Trump has repeatedly praised Vladimir Putin, usually depicting him as a powerful and canny leader. As early as May 2023, Trump said that were he to lead the US again, he would end the Russia-Ukraine war \u2018in 24 hours\u2019, reiterating this on the campaign trail. Although his timescale is implausible, a Trump-aligned US foreign policy institute earlier this year proposed quickly pressuring Ukraine into talks with Russia in a way that would probably freeze the conflict along current lines.\n\nA hastily negotiated peace agreement that allowed Russia to retain occupied territory would have profound implications for Ukraine, international law and security, and Russia itself. It would probably, for example, allow President Putin to present a highly damaging phase in Russia\u2019s modern history as a historic victory against the \u2018collective West\u2019. It would give Russia time to rearm and strengthen the emerging alliance of authoritarian powers, led by China, as the main US rival for global leadership.\n\nYet there are marked differences within Trump\u2019s camp, adding to uncertainty about what his foreign policy might be. In late July, Mike Pompeo, Trump\u2019s former secretary of state and current adviser, co-authored a more Ukraine-friendly \u2018Trump peace plan\u2019 for The Wall Street Journal. It proposes, for instance, creating a very substantial lend-lease programme for Ukraine, of up to $500 billion, for purchases of US weapons.\n\nA Harris presidency would signal foreign policy continuity\n\nA Harris presidency would probably continue much of Joe Biden\u2019s foreign policy, including on Ukraine. As vice president, Harris has been closely involved in the US response to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, most recently attending a Ukrainian-led peace conference in Switzerland in June 2024. And at the Democratic National Convention (DNC) in late August, where she formally accepted the party\u2019s nomination, Harris said \u2018As president, I will stand with Ukraine and our NATO allies\u2019.\n\nA Harris presidency would very probably continue to fund Ukraine to prevent its military defeat by Russia, albeit not to the extent that it could achieve decisive military success. Still, this would dash Russia\u2019s expectations for a quick partial victory along the current front lines, even as its manpower and industrial resources are stretched. A Harris victory would probably therefore deal a significant psychological blow to at least parts of the Russian elite, weakening Putin\u2019s regime.\n\nThere is no guarantee that the commitment of a Harris administration would translate smoothly into financial backing for Ukraine. Rather, this is likely to depend on the distribution of seats between the parties in the US Congress after November. During a pause in US funding in late 2023, shortages of munitions allowed Russia to advance in Donetsk and devastate large parts of Ukraine\u2019s power sector. It is plausible that such a confrontation between the executive and the legislature could happen again, enabling Russia to achieve similar gains.\n\nAlternative prospects: early talks or US turns inward\n\nAlternative courses remain possible, however. One is that, faced with the renewed prospect of Democratic victory in the US, Russian leaders pursue peace talks with Ukraine before the US election. This is not entirely implausible, but the prospect has probably been superseded by the Kursk offensive, which Russia\u2019s foreign minister said in late August had made talks with Ukraine \u2018impossible\u2019. Moreover, the victory in early September of parties of the far-right and populist left in German regional elections will probably encourage Russia\u2019s political leadership to believe its attempts to undermine European political support for Ukraine are working.\n\nA second alternative is that, following a Trump defeat, the US enters a period of internal turmoil. Lengthy legal challenges to election results, or even violent challenges from some Trump supporters, could create a hiatus in US governance, drawing America\u2019s focus away from international affairs. Any prolonged period of US domestic instability would weaken transatlantic unity, at least temporarily, potentially emboldening Russia to try to expand its territorial gains in Ukraine, and testing Europe\u2019s resolve.",

Some aides have said they now regret that decision, saying voters were shielded from hearing Trump\u2019s outbursts during the June debate. A disastrous performance for the incumbent Democrat fueled his exit from the campaign.Once Harris rose in Biden's stead and became their party's pick for president, her campaign had advocated for live microphones for the whole debate, saying previously that the practice would \u201cfully allow for substantive exchanges between the candidates.\u201dBut on Wednesday, in a letter obtained by The Associated Press, Harris\u2019 advisers wrote that the former prosecutor will be \u201cfundamentally disadvantaged by this format, which will serve to shield Donald Trump from direct exchanges with the Vice President.\"\u201cWe suspect this is the primary reason for his campaign\u2019s insistence on muted microphones,\u201d her campaign added.Despite those concerns, Harris' campaign wrote, \u201cwe understand that Donald Trump is a risk to skip the debate altogether, as he has threatened to do previously, if we do not accede to his preferred format.\u201d So as not to \u201cjeopardize the debate,\u201d Harris' campaign wrote, \u201cwe accepted the full set of rules proposed by ABC, including muted microphones.\u201dAccording to an official with Harris\u2019 campaign, a pool of journalists will be on hand to hear what the muted candidate may be trying to say when his or her microphone is turned off. That detail was not in the full debate rules, also released Wednesday by ABC, which are essentially the same as they were for the June debate between Trump and Biden.The network laid out parameters from the basic format \u2014 90 minutes, with two commercial breaks \u2014 to specifications that moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis \u201cwill be the only people asking questions,\u201d perhaps hoping to avert a free-for-all between the candidates.\u201cModerators will seek to enforce timing agreements and ensure a civilized discussion,\u201d the network noted.The Harris campaign official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss planning around the debate, said a candidate who repeatedly interrupts will receive a warning from a moderator, and both candidates' microphones may be unmuted if there is significant crosstalk so the audience can understand what's happening.After a virtual coin flip held Tuesday and won by Trump, the GOP nominee opted to offer the final closing statement, while Harris chose the podium on the right side of viewers\u2019 screens. There will be no audience, written notes or any topics or questions shared with campaigns or candidates in advance, the network said.A1. US election 2024 is on November 5.A2.

        "text": "Historian who accurately predicted 9 of last 10 presidential elections makes his 2024 pick\nWASHINGTON - Allan Lichtman, the historian who correctly predicted the outcome of 9 out of the 10 most recent presidential elections, has made his guess on who will reclaim the White House this year.\n\nSpoiler alert: it\u2019s Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nLichtman said in a video, first reported by The New York Times, that he based his prediction on thirteen keys or \u201cbig picture true-false questions that tap into the strength and performance of the White House Party.\u201d\n\nWho is Allan Lichtman?\n\nBefore receiving the title of \"Distinguished Professor\" from the American University in Washington, D.C., Lichtman earned a Ph.D. specializing in modern American history and quantitative methods at Harvard.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nIn addition to lecturing in the U.S. and around the world, Lichtman is the author of 13 books and hundreds of academic articles. He has also been an expert witness in civil and voting rights cases.\n\nHe routinely provides political commentary and is best known for his election forecasting.\n\nWhat are the 13 keys?\n\nThe keys include whether:\n\n\u25fe The White House party gained House seats during the midterm elections.\n\n\u25fe The sitting president is running for reelection.\n\n\u25fe The White House party is avoiding a primary contest.\n\n\u25fe There is a third-party challenger.\n\n\u25fe The short-term economy is strong.\n\n\u25fe The long-term economic growth has been as good as the last two terms.\n\n\u25fe The White House party has made major changes to national policy.\n\n\u25fe There is sustained social unrest during the term.\n\n\u25fe The White House is untainted by scandal, the incumbent party is charismatic.\n\n\u25fe The challenger is uncharismatic.\n\n\u25fe The incumbent is charismatic.\n\n\u25fe The White House party has a major failure in foreign policy.\n\n\u25fe The White House party has foreign policy success.\n\nEight of the keys are in favor of Harris, while three are in favor of Trump.\n\n\u201cForeign policy is tricky, and these keys could flip,\u201d he said in the video. \u201cThe Biden administration is deeply invested in the war in Gaza, which is a humanitarian disaster with no end in sight. But even if both foreign policy keys flipped false, that would mean that there were only five negative keys, which would not be enough for Donald Trump to regain the White House.\u201d\n\nThat leaves Harris winning the White House, he said. \u201cAt least that's my prediction for this race, but the outcome is up to you, so get out and vote.\u201d\n\nLichtman has correctly predicted the outcome of almost every election over the last half-century, except for the race in 2000, in which Republican George W. Bush defeated Democrat Al Gore.\n\nContributing: Karissa Waddick",

        "text": "Who will win the 2024 election? Presidential predictor Allan Lichtman to announce 'VERY' soon\nAllan Lichtman , an American University professor who has accurately predicted the winner of nearly every U.S. presidential election since 1984, is expected to announce who he believes will take the White House in November \"very soon,\" he said in a post on X.\n\nLichtman has been relying on his \"13 Keys to the White House\" to determine the winners of these races for decades. He will release his final prediction within a week of Labor Day \u2014 \"give or take a day or two\" \u2014 Lichtman said in a video posted to his YouTube channel.\n\nHe then made a social media post on Wednesday saying, \"My prediction is coming VERY soon in the New York Times and then our YouTube channel.\"\n\nFOX 5 has spoken with Lichtman multiple times throughout the tumultuous election season.\n\nAfter President Joe Biden dropped out of the race in July and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, Lichtman had strong words for Democrats amid the shake-up, telling the party to \"get smart and unite.\"\n\nSince then, Lichtman says they have done just that, effectively saving the \"party contest key.\"\n\n\"The Democrats finally grew a spine and got smart after publicly trashing their incumbent president,\" he told FOX 5. \"They united behind Harris and therefore avoided losing the party contest key.\"\n\nREAD MORE: When is the Kamala-Trump presidential debate?\n\nAt the beginning of August, Lichtman said a lot would have to go wrong for the Democrats to lose the White House.\n\nThe 13 Keys KEY 1 (Party Mandate) KEY 2 (Contest) KEY 3 (Incumbency) KEY 4 (Third Party) KEY 5 (Short-Term Economy) KEY 6 (Long-Term Economy) KEY 7 (Policy Change) KEY 8 (Social Unrest) KEY 9 (Scandal) KEY 10 (Foreign/Military Failure) KEY 11 (Foreign/Military Success) KEY 12 (Incumbent Charisma) KEY 13 (Challenger Charisma)\n\n\n\nAccording to his system, the Democratic party needs to lose six keys for him to predict their loss. At the time, he said they were down three \u2014 Party Mandate, Incumbency and Incumbent Charisma.\n\n\"Three more keys would have to fall to predict their defeat,\" Lichtman said. \"And only two keys right now look really shaky.\"\n\nThose keys are foreign policy and social unrest.\n\nREAD MORE: DC Jewish community plan vigil to honor 6 Israeli hostages killed in Gaza\n\nThis was prior to the Democratic National Convention in Chicago where Harris formally accepted the party\u2019s nomination. It was a high-energy convention where Democrats showed resounding support for the vice president. It led to a slight bump for Harris in the national polls , where she still holds a slim margin over former President Donald Trump.\n\nEven though the event solidified Harris\u2019 party support, Lichtman says foreign policy and social unrest could still play a big role with two wars raging in Gaza and Ukraine. Lichtman says he is taking this into account and will go further into detail when he releases his final decision.\n\n\"Wars are always unpredictable,\" Lichtman said. \"There are some unpredictable factors out there but I will explain to you just how I\u2019ve made adjustments for the fluidity of what\u2019s going on abroad.\"\n\nAs for Trump and the Republican Party, Lichtman took a swing at statistician Nate Silver , who recently came out saying that there is a 52.4% probability that Trump will win the election.\n\n\"Just a few days ago, he said the probability is that Kamala Harris is going to win the election. Now, just a few days later he switched,\" Lichtman said. \"That\u2019s not a real probability. That\u2019s a made-up probability.\"\n\nIn what may also be a show of hand, Lichtman said he is taking Trump\u2019s incident at Arlington Cemetery last week into account.\n\nREAD MORE: Trump issues statement from Gold Star families defending Arlington Cemetery visit\n\nThe Trump campaign says the former president was invited to the cemetery to honor the lives of military members killed during the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan three years ago.\n\nDespite being warned not to take photographs or video during a wreath-laying ceremony, Trump staffers did so and later posted the footage on social media in \"flagrant violation\" of the law, officials said.\n\n\"The other thing that\u2019s on my mind is the incident at Arlington Cemetery,\" Lichtman said. \"Trump was warned that it was illegal to use the graves of our departed heroes for political purposes. Not just inappropriate but flatly against federal law.\"\n\nLichtman says with military members and families being a key sector of the GOP voter base, incidents like this can have a negative impact for Trump.",

        "text": "Legendary presidential predictor Allan Lichtman makes his 2024 White House pick\narticle\n\nThe Brief Allan Lichtman has a nearly perfect track record of predicting presidential elections over the past 40 years. Lichtman is a historian at American University. He makes his prediction based on what he calls his \"13 Keys.\"\n\n\n\nThe man often referred to as the \"Nostradamus of presidential election predictions\" has spoken.\n\nAmerican University historian Allan Lichtman has a remarkable track record, accurately calling nearly every U.S. presidential election since 1984, including finding himself among a minority in 2016 when he forecast Donald Trump\u2019s presidential election win.\n\nOn Tuesday, Lichtman revealed who he believes will be the next person to occupy the White House.\n\n\"The democrats will hold on the White House, and Kamala Harris will be the next President of the United States,\" the professor announced definitively in a New York Times Opinion piece that included video of Lichtman making his prediction and laying out his supporting arguments.\n\nLichtman bases his predictions on what he calls \"13 big picture true or false questions that tap into the strength and performance of the White House party.\"\n\nSEE ALSO: Republican Liz Cheney endorses Kamala Harris for president\n\nThe historian called the 13 keys \"the constant northern star of political prediction.\"\n\nHere's a look at Lichtman\u2019s verdict on each predictor. A \"false\" determination is a win for Trump. And a \"true\" ruling is a win for Harris.\n\nMidterm gains: False-The Democrats lost House seats in 2022. Incumbency: False- because if Joe Biden had stayed in the race, he would have been the incumbent, Lichtman explained. Primary contest: True-\"The democrats finally got smart and united overwhelmingly behind Vice President Harris,\" Lichtman said. Third party challenger: True- With Robert Kennedy Jr. dropping out of the race, Lichtman said he left no major third party in the race. Short-term economy: True- \"The economy is not in recession,\" Lichtman noted. Long-term economy: True-\"Growth during the Biden term is far ahead of growth during the pervious two terms,\" Lichtman said. Policy change: True- Lichtman gave examples, including rejoining the Paris Accords on climate change in 2021 and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. Sustained social unrest: True- Lichtman said while there have been \"sporadic protests,\" the unrest does not fall under the category of being sustained and significant enough to make this a false statement. White House scandal: True- Lichtman said Republicans have failed to come up with a scandal to pin on President Biden, noting, \"There has to be at least some bipartisan recognition of actual corruption that implicates the president himself and not a family member.\" Incumbent charisma: False- \"You have to be once in a generational, broadly inspirational candidate,\" Lichtman said, adding, \"Harris has not met that standard.\" Challenger charisma: True- Lichtman said that while some consider Trump to be ultra charismatic and godlike, \"he only appeals to a narrow base.\"\n\nAs for his final two keys: 12. Foreign policy failure and 13. Foreign policy success , Lichtman said this area is \"tricky\" and could flip either way at any moment given the volatile situation in the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nLichtman stressed his five negative or false keys are not enough for Donald Trump to regain the White House.\n\nAnd while the 77-year-old academician stood by his analysis with confidence, he also noted that in the end, \"The outcome is up to you,\" and he challenged, \"So get out and vote.\"",

        "text": "Historian who predicted 9 of last 10 presidential elections makes his 2024 pick\nVice President Kamala Harris or former President Donald Trump?\n\nAmerican historian Allan Lichtman, who has correctly predicted nine of the last 10 presidential election winners joined Scripps News on Thursday to reveal his pick for 2024.\n\n\"So my call is that we're going to make history here, that Kamala Harris will become the first woman president of the United States,\" he said.\n\nThe announcement is the latest good news for Harris, who has continued to gain momentum in the national polls following President Joe Biden's decision to drop out of the race for the White House.\n\nRELATED STORY | Harris is taking an increasing polling edge against Trump, but what does that mean?\n\nWith just 60 days until the election, Real Clear Politics shows Harris with a two-point lead over Trump. But Lichtman notes that polls aren't necessarily predictive of an election. Instead, he uses a unique system of criteria named after his book, \"The Keys to the White House.\"\n\n\"The 'Keys to the White House' have you forget the pundits who have no scientific basis. Forget the polls, which are snapshots,\" Lichtman said. \"The keys tap into the structure of how elections really work, as votes up or down on the strength of performance of the White House party. And it takes six of the 13 keys to be negative to predict the White House party's defeat.\"\n\n\"In my analysis, what I found was at most \u2014 depending on what happens in the two wars \u2014 even under the worst scenario, the White House party represented by Kamala Harris would lose only five keys, one short of needed to predict their defeat,\" Lichtman continued.\n\nRELATED STORY | Will RFK Jr.'s exit help or hurt Trump's campaign against VP Harris?\n\nLichtman added that his 13 key prediction system doesn't depend on which two candidates are in any given race. Rather, it's a system he's created that essentially grades the strength and performance of the current White House party in control.\n\n\"Only two [keys] tap into the candidates,\" he explained. \"And they're very high threshold keys asking whether the incumbent party candidate is one of those once-in-a-generation, broadly inspirational candidates \u2014 like FDR and Ronald Reagan \u2014 and of course whether the challenger is not one of those candidates.\"\n\nYou can watch our full interview with Lichtman in the video player above.",

        "text": "The battleground States that could decide the U.S. Presidential elections | Data\nThe battle lines for the U.S. presidential elections were drawn when Vice President Kamala Harris and Governor Tim Walz were announced as the Democratic Party\u2019s nominees for President and Vice President, respectively. They will face the Republican Party\u2019s nominees, former President Donald Trump and his running mate, J.D. Vance. As of now, according to opinion polls, Ms. Harris has a three-plus point lead on average over Mr. Trump.\n\nAlso read: In Tim Walz, Kamala Harris gets a trump card to trump Trump\n\nIn the U.S., it is not enough for the candidate to win the popular vote in percentage terms. They have to win the electoral college, a group of presidential electors from each State whose number is determined by the population of the State. The electoral college consists of 538 electors and the candidate requires a majority of 270 votes to become President. Large States such as California, Texas, New York, and Florida, for example, provide 55, 38, 29, and 29 electoral college votes each.\n\nIn this first article of a series of articles on the U.S. elections, we will look at \u2018battleground States\u2019 or \u2018swing States\u2019.\n\nAlso read: The Hindu Explains | What are swing States in U.S. polls?\n\nThe maps show how each State voted in elections since 2000. States that were won by the two parties by more than 5% points are marked (red for Republican and blue for Democrats). The larger the difference in vote shares between the parties, the deeper the shades of colours (dark red for more Republican votes and dark blue for more Democrat votes).\n\nChart appears incomplete? Click to remove AMP mode\n\nSince 2016, when Mr. Trump made his electoral foray, the starkness in the support base of the two parties has been more pronounced than ever before. States that are largely rural, have a substantial number of religiously minded voters, are less racially diverse, and have a large white-working class population tend to vote Republican, while Democrats receive substantive support from States with a significant urban population, a diverse demography, and a considerable number of college-educated voters.\n\nThere are some States with a mix of urban and rural voters and a diverse demography; these are the swing States where there is intense competition between the two parties. Some swing States, such as Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, are from the \u2018Rust Belt\u2019 \u2014 i.e., they were industrialised but have seen industrial decline and relative urban decay since. Some others, such as Georgia, Florida, and North Carolina in the south-east and Arizona, Nevada, and New Mexico in the west/south-west, are from the \u2018Sun Belt\u2019 \u2014 i.e., they have a warm climate. Swing States are marked with a yellowish tinge. Since 2016, these States have moved decisively towards the Republican Party.\n\nMs. Harris and Mr. Trump need victories in a definite combination of swing States in the two Belts to win elections. If the swing States are not included and the two parties\u2019 strongholds are expected to vote for them, the Democrats and Republicans would have 221 and 189 electoral votes, respectively.\n\nThe opinion polls show a close race in the swing States (Table 1). If the polling averages hold true in these States, the electoral college votes would break 292-246 in favour of the Democrats. But the margins between the two parties are very close. If one of the Rust Belt States (say, Pennsylvania) and one of the Sun Belt States (say, Georgia) provide more votes to Mr. Trump than Ms. Harris, the electoral numbers would be 281-257 in favour of the Republicans.\n\nThe table shows the latest polling averages for Ms. Harris and Mr. Trump in the swing States (as of August 31)\n\nAs the election gets closer, the two parties will focus on campaigning in these States. In forthcoming articles, we will look into the two parties\u2019 support bases and how they have changed over time.\n\nSource: Nate Silver\u2019s substack, historical electoral data from various sources\n\nAlso read: A shift in the U.S. to autocratic trends",

        "text": "Putin Backs Kamala Harris For US Presidency, Says 'Admire Her Infectious Laugh'\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has expressed his support for US Vice President Kamala Harris in the upcoming presidential elections in November.\n\nSpeaking at the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok today, Mr Putin said that he admired the Democratic Party candidate's \"infectious laugh\", Russian state media Russia Today (RT) reported.\n\nThe Russian leader had earlier backed US President Joe Biden, who he said is \"a more experienced, predictable person, a politician of the old school\". He added that he respected President Biden's decision to endorse her as his successor.\n\nDuring a plenary session of the forum, Mr Putin said Kamala Harris \"laughs so infectiously\" that it suggests \"everything is going well for her\". He said this in response to a query about whether he had a favourite candidate in the election now that Mr Biden had dropped out.\n\n\"In the end, the choice is up to the American people and we will treat their eventual decision with respect,\" he said.\n\nHe also said that Ms Harris' positive disposition could mean she might refrain from imposing sanctions on Russia. According to an RT report, Mr Putin went on to say that former US President Donald Trump introduced more restrictions on Moscow than any other President in American history.\n\nIn repsonse to Mr Putin's remark, National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby urged the leader to \"stop interfering\" in US elections.\n\n\"The only people who should get to determine who the next president of United States is are the American people, and we would greatly appreciate it if Mr. Putin would, a) stop talking about our election, and b) stop interfering in it,\" he said.\n\nThis comes amid reports of the US planning to accuse Russia of a campaign to influence the 2024 elections. A CNN report that cited six sources familiar with the matter, said Russia would target American voters with disinformation using online platforms.\n\nRussian lawmaker Maria Butina spoke to Reuters and branded the report as \"pure rubbish\" and a \"witch hunt\". Notably, Ms Butina spent 15 months in a US prison for acting as an unregistered Russian agent before becoming a lawmaker for the ruling United Russia party.",

        "text": "Seven 'toss-up' battleground states are set to decide the US presidential election\nThe US's Electoral College system means Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are effectively battling each other in only a handful of places.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAs the US closes in on its presidential election on 5 November, a run of recent polls shows that Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are in a virtual tie \u2014 particularly in key swing states.\n\nUnder the US's electoral system, each state is allocated a certain number of Electoral College votes corresponding to their representation in Congress. There are 538 votes in total, meaning 270 are needed to secure a victory.\n\nMost states allocate their electoral votes to whichever candidate wins the statewide vote. However, Maine and Nebraska split theirs, meaning it is possible for a candidate to pick up a vote even if the other wins the state outright.\n\nBoth candidates are intensifying their efforts, and their campaigns are heavily focused on seven critical battleground states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Wisconsin.\n\nIf the other 43 states follow the pollsters' predictions as \"solid\" \"leaning\" or \"likely\" wins for each party, the election will be decided on the outcome of the seven toss-up states shown in grey above. Together they share 93 of the 538 votes available.\n\nHarris would need 44 of these votes to win, while Trump would need 51.\n\nWhere Hillary Clinton lost to Trump in 2016 by losing Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, Joe Biden reversed her loss in the 2020 election by winning all three and picking up Arizona, Georgia, and Nebraska's second congressional district.\n\nThese graphics will be updated regularly.",

KIRILL KAZACHKOV / VIA REUTERS\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday, September 5, he supported Kamala Harris in the upcoming US presidential election, an apparent wry remark that led to a renewed call from Washington for the Kremlin to \"stop interfering.\" Putin was speaking a day after the United States issued indictments accusing Moscow of vote interference.\n\nThe Kremlin leader frequently comments on political and social issues in the United States, often in a mocking way. He said last year that the US political system was \"rotten\" and that Washington could not lecture other countries about democracy. \"Firstly, (US President Joe) Biden recommended all his supporters support Ms. Harris,\" Putin said during a question and answer session at Russia's Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok. \"Here, we are going to do that too, we're going to support her,\" he added, with a wry smile.\n\n\"She laughs so contagiously that it shows that everything is fine with her,\" the Russian leader said. \"(Former US President Donald) Trump has imposed as many sanctions on Russia as any president has ever imposed before, and if Harris is doing well, perhaps she will refrain from such actions.\"\n\n'Stop interfering'\n\nResponding to Putin's comments, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby on Thursday urged the Russian leader to \"stop interfering\" in US elections. \"The only people who should get to determine who the next president of United States is are the American people, and we would greatly appreciate it if Mr. Putin would, a) stop talking about our election, and b) stop interfering in it,\" National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters.\n\nRead more Subscribers only US announces measures to combat Russian interference ahead of presidential election\n\nIn February, Putin backed Biden over Trump, calling the current president more \"predictable.\" The White House called on Putin to \"stay out\" of US elections. Putin's comments come a day after the United States indicted two employees of state-run Russian news network RT and slapped sanctions on its top editors. Washington accused them of trying to influence the upcoming US ballot.",

        "text": "How Europe should react to the US presidential elections\nFollowing the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump, his victory seemed to be a sure thing. Then, after President Joe Biden\u2019s withdrawal announcement, the momentum shifted, with Vice President and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris raising $200 million in the next week alone, bringing the total to $310 million in July \u2014 more than double the already enormous amount Trump had raised that month. And now, she\u2019s started leading the polls in the three key battleground states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nIn light of all this, it wouldn\u2019t be at all surprising if the race took yet another unexpected turn, making it even harder to predict any sort of outcome and thus prepare for what\u2019s ahead. Given the race\u2019s significant global importance and impact, this need for preparation is felt almost worldwide \u2014 though probably most intensely in Europe during this time of war. And the substantial differences between the two candidates, and their resultant impact on the Continent\u2019s security and prosperity, are indisputable.\n\nIt\u2019s often overlooked, however, that massive strategic changes in U.S. politics are underway regardless of the election\u2019s outcome, or rather \u2014 one could argue \u2014 that Trump is less the driver of these changes and more their symptom. And this should alter Europe\u2019s strategic response.\n\nEurope shouldn\u2019t be looking at the election outcome like a rabbit at a snake, hoping for a seemingly favorable result. Instead, it must independently and quickly define and work toward its own goals regardless of the result \u2014 even more so given its unpredictability.\n\nAs it stands, the U.S. is in the middle of increasingly shifting its focus toward the Indo-Pacific region, independent of its strong support for Ukraine and the planned return of long-range U.S. missiles to Europe. It\u2019s a process that began under former President Barack Obama \u2014 with the catchphrases \u201cpivot to Asia\u201d and \u201crebalancing\u201d \u2014 and continued under Trump.\n\nToday, the Biden administration views China as the greatest and most comprehensive challenge to American security. Consequently, China will remain America\u2019s main competitor for the foreseeable future, receiving the corresponding amount of attention. And U.S. demands that other parts of the world, including Europe, choose sides in this competition will only grow louder, possibly forcing the EU to make tough decisions.",

        "summary": " U.S. Department of Justice says it disrupted Russian foreign malign influence campaigns . DOJ accuses two Russian employees of RT, state-owned media outlet, of nearly $10 million scheme . DOJ seized 32 internet domains used in the effort and named Russian companies involved .",
        "text": "U.S. accuses Russia of sophisticated influence campaigns against U.S. voters\nU.S. accuses Russia of sophisticated influence campaigns against U.S. voters\n\ntoggle caption Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice on Wednesday said it disrupted Russian-directed foreign malign influence campaigns it referred to as \u201cDoppelganger,\u201d that sought to spread Russian government propaganda.\n\nThe effort was meant to reduce international support for Ukraine, bolster pro-Russian policies, and influence voters in the U.S. and elsewhere, the Justice Department said.\n\nSeparately, the DOJ accused two Russian employees of RT, the Russian state-owned media outlet, of a nearly $10 million scheme to create and distribute content to U.S. audiences while keeping the connection to Russia hidden.\n\nRT worked with an online content creation company in Tennessee, which was directed to contract with U.S. social media influencers to distribute its content on social media platforms including, TikTok, X, Instagram and YouTube. Since November, the company posted more than 2,000 videos that received more than 16 million views on YouTube, according to the indictment.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe link to Russia was never disclosed, the DOJ said.\n\nThe two RT employees, Kostiantyn Kalashnikov, 31, and Elena Afanasyeva, 27, have been charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to violate the Foreign Agents Registration Act.\n\n\"The American people are entitled to know when a foreign power is attempting to exploit our country's free exchange of ideas in order to send around its own propaganda,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said Wednesday.\n\nThe two indictments come as the U.S. has been increasingly warning about Russia\u2019s efforts to influence U.S. voters through a variety of efforts.\n\nAs part of the Doppelganger investigation, the DOJ said it seized 32 internet domains used in the effort, and named Russian companies Social Design Agency (SDA), Structura National Technology (Structura), and ANO Dialog as being involved in the effort.\n\nThe effort involved Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s inner circle, including First Deputy Chief of Staff of the Presidential Executive Office Sergei Vladilenovich Kiriyenko, it said.\n\nGarland announced the charges at a meeting of the DOJ's election threats task force, which was set up in 2021 to counter the growing number of threats nationwide against election officials and administrators. He said the investigation remains active.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe Treasury and State Departments have parallel actions on these matters, Garland said.\n\nIn a statement on its website ahead of the charges, RT dismissed the findings, joking that their responses included comments like \u201cHa!\u201d and \u201c2016 called and it wants its clich\u00e9s back.\u201d\n\nGarland made clear to reporters that he was not amused.\n\n\"I'm sure that was much funnier in the original Russian, but for us, it's not funny,\" Garland said. \"This is deadly serious and we are going to treat it accordingly.\"\n\nFBI Director Chris Wray said Russia has a long history of meddling in American society, though now there are increasingly sophisticated tools like artificial intelligence to amplify the efforts.\n\n\u201cWhether it's shell companies, fake personas, secret distribution networks, the point is not the message itself,\" Wray said. \"The point is the hidden hand of the Russian government, which deceives Americans into thinking that they're getting information from American sources when in fact it's coming from the Russian government.\"\n\n\n\nWarnings for months\n\nUnited States intelligence and security officials have been warning for months about Russia\u2019s efforts to interfere in the 2024 election, specifically to undermine the Democratic presidential nominee, exploit social divisions, sow distrust in democratic institutions and to erode support for Ukraine.\n\nThe U.S. has provided arms to Ukraine to support its war following Russia's invasion in 2022.\n\n\u201cRussia remains the most active foreign threat to our elections,\u201d Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines told senators in May at a briefing about election risks.\n\nThis is not the first time the U.S. has taken action against those behind the Doppelganger influence campaign.\n\nIn March, the U.S. Treasury sanctioned Social Design Agency and Structura, as well as their founders, for a network of fake accounts and phony news websites, saying they carried out the campaign \"at the direction of the Russian Presidential Administration.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe Doppelganger campaign, which was first identified by researchers at EU DisinfoLab in 2022, has impersonated news outlets including The Washington Post and Fox News, and it has posed as NATO, the Polish and Ukrainian governments, the German police and the French Foreign Ministry.\n\nThe campaign recently used fake French-language news sites to push claims of corruption at the recent Paris Olympics and to warn of potential violence, according to a Microsoft report.\n\n\n\nPrior propaganda campaigns\n\nThe Kremlin has long relied on fake social media accounts to sow discord and advance its own interests.\n\nIn July, the Justice Department said it disrupted a Russian propaganda campaign that used artificial intelligence tools and relied on fake social media accounts impersonating Americans to spread disinformation in the U.S. and other countries. It said the effort involved an editor at RT.\n\nThe Justice Department required RT\u2019s U.S. arm to register as a foreign agent in 2017, after US intelligence officials said it was involved in Russian attempts to interfere in the 2016 election.\n\nThe bot farm used AI to create the fake profiles on X, formerly known as Twitter. The accounts posted support for Russia's war in Ukraine and other pro-Kremlin narratives. The effort and the AI software behind it were organized by an editor at RT, the Russian state-owned media outlet, the Justice Department alleged. The project was funded by the Kremlin and run by a Russian intelligence officer.\n\nAt the time, when asked for comment on the allegations, RT's press office replied: \"Farming is a beloved pastime for millions of Russians.\"\n\n",

The duo said the delay is somewhat \u201con purpose\u201d because they no longer have an interest in lampooning Trump on the show, but Parker added that they\u2019re also \u201cwaiting for Paramount to figure all their shit out.\u201d\n\nNeither creator specified on what Parker meant about Paramount, but the studio has been going through a proposed sale over the last several months. Paramount Global is currently pending sale to Skydance after the two companies reached a sale agreement in early July worth a reported $8 billion. Skydance claims the deal has an enterprise value of $28 billion, with Skydance itself valued at $4.75 billion.\n\nAs for skipping the 2024 presidential election on purpose, Stone noted: \u201cWe\u2019ve tried to do \u2018South Park\u2019 through four or five presidential elections, and it is such a hard thing to \u2014 it\u2019s such a mind scramble, and it seems like it takes outsized importance.\u201d\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n\u201cObviously, it\u2019s fucking important, but it kind of takes over everything and we just have less fun.\u201d Parker added. \u201cI don\u2019t know what more we could possibly say about Trump.\u201d\n\n\u201cSouth Park\u2019s\u201d last proper season was its 26th, and it consisted of six episodes that aired in 2023. Since then, Parker and Stone have created three standalone specials that streamed exclusively on Paramount+ starting last fall: \u201cSouth Park: Joining the Panderverse,\u201d \u201cSouth Park (Not Suitable for Children)\u201d and \u201cSouth Park: The End of Obesity.\u201d The latter special, which targeted weight loss drugs such as Ozempic, streamed in May 2024.

        "text": "\u2018Russia backs Kamala Harris\u2019: Putin\u2019s history of US election \u2018endorsements\u2019\nFor two decades, Russian President Putin has stirred the US election pot, including by signalling support for candidates.\n\nPutin says Russia will 'support' Harris in US election\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday said Moscow would back US Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic Party\u2019s nominee, in presidential elections in November.\n\nThe nature of Putin\u2019s comments suggests he was joking, or trolling the Harris campaign, at a time when the US government under the Joe Biden administration has levelled new allegations that Russia is seeking to interfere in the November vote, to favour former President Donald Trump.\n\nYet whatever Putin\u2019s motivations for the comments on Harris, they are the latest iteration of the Russian leader\u2019s attempts to inject Moscow into the US electoral process.\n\nThis is not the first time Putin has thrown his support behind a US presidential candidate. Putin himself has been in Russia\u2019s top job since 2012. He was also president between 2000 and 2008.\n\nAl Jazeera recaps two decades of the Russian president\u2019s tongue-in-cheek meddling in US elections.\n\nDid Putin endorse Harris?\n\nAt an economic forum in the Russian Far East port of Vladivostok, Putin wryly said that current President Joe Biden was his \u201cfavourite\u201d.\n\nSince Biden has dropped out of the race and endorsed Harris, she was Putin\u2019s next best bet, the Russian leader teased.\n\nHe added that Harris has an \u201cexpressive and infectious laugh\u201d, which indicates \u201cshe\u2019s doing well\u201d. The audience broke into scattered laughter as he said that if Harris is doing well, maybe she would not impose sanctions on Russia.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m insulted or he did me a favour,\u201d Republican challenger Trump responded at a campaign stop at the New York Economic Club on Thursday.\n\nPutin\u2019s comments came a day after the US Department of Justice accused Russian-owned state broadcaster RT of campaigning to sway the US vote, indicting two Russian journalists.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t the first time that Putin has stirred the pot of US domestic politics.\n\n2004: Putin endorses Bush\n\nIn October 2004, Putin endorsed Republican incumbent President George W Bush. He said that if Bush lost it would lead to the \u201cspread of terrorism\u201d globally.\n\nBush had been facing criticism from Democratic challenger John Kerry for not adequately tackling \u201cterrorism\u201d.\n\nThis was amid the war on Iraq which started in 2003 after the US under Bush invaded the country.\n\nBush defeated Kerry in the 2004 race and was re-elected as president.\n\n2008: Russia leans towards Obama win\n\nWhile Putin did not make a clear endorsement in the 2008 US presidential race, experts were clear that a win for Democrat Barack Obama over Republican John McCain was Russia\u2019s preferred outcome.\n\nWhile both Obama and McCain held a harsh stance on Russia, Kremlin officials believed that under Obama, a newcomer at the time, US-Russia relations could start with a clean slate unlike under Cold War veteran McCain.\n\nAfter being in office for two terms between 2000 and 2008, Putin was constitutionally barred from assuming the role of president for a third consecutive term.\n\nHence, Dmitry Medvedev rose to the top job with Putin as his premier. However, it was widely believed in Russia and globally at the time that Putin continued to hold real power in Russia. It was said that Putin and Medvedev ruled in \u201ctandemocracy\u201d.\n\nObama won the 2008 election.\n\n2012: Putin praises Obama\n\nAhead of the 2012 US presidential race, in which Obama was taking on Republican challenger Mitt Romney, Putin told Russian state media that Obama was \u201can honest person who really wants to change much for the better\u201d.\n\nRomney had deemed Russia the top \u201cgeopolitical foe\u201d of the US, something Putin said Romney was \u201cmistaken\u201d about, during the same interview.\n\nObama defeated Romney in the 2012 election.\n\n2015: Putin deems Trump \u2018outstanding and talented\u2019\n\nAhead of the 2016 US election, Putin spoke highly of Trump during an annual news conference with reporters.\n\n\u201cHe is a bright and talented person without any doubt,\u201d he said, adding that Trump is \u201coutstanding and talented\u201d.\n\nTrump was up against Democratic challenger Hilary Clinton in the election.\n\nAfter Trump\u2019s election victory, Putin said Trump was a \u201cclever man\u201d who would \u201cquickly understand\u201d his role in office.\n\n2016: US blames Russia for DNC leaks, election interference\n\nIn July 2016, Democratic National Committee (DNC) emails were hacked and leaked, showing preferential treatment to Clinton, angering supporters of her primary Democatic opponent Bernie Sanders.\n\nThe US government formally placed the blame for the hack on Russia in a joint statement by the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.\n\nPutin denied Russia\u2019s role in the DNC hack but said the leaks themselves were important. \u201cThe important thing is the content that was given to the public,\u201d he said.\n\nThe US also accused Russia of a larger election interference programme aimed at defeating Clinton and helping Trump come to power, involving troll farms that amplified messaging tailored against the Democrats.\n\n2019: Putin jokes Russia will meddle in 2020 election\n\nIn October 2019, on a panel at Russian Energy Week, Putin was asked if he would interfere with the 2020 US election.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you a secret: Yes, we\u2019ll definitely do it. Just don\u2019t tell anyone,\u201d the Russian president joked in a fake whisper.\n\nHe then said his working relationship with Trump did not mean that he had any influence on the domestic politics in the US. He insisted that he did not interfere in the 2016 US election and that he was dealing with issues in his own country.\n\n\u201cWe have our own problems,\u201d he said.",

Photograph: Getty/Guardian Design Team\n\nHere is the biggest thing happening on our planet as we head into the autumn of 2024: the Earth is continuing to heat dramatically. Scientists have said that there\u2019s a better than 90% chance that this year will top 2023 as the warmest ever recorded. And paleoclimatologists were pretty sure last year was the hottest in the last 125,000 years. The result is an almost-cliched run of disasters: open Twitter/X anytime for pictures of floods pushing cars through streets somewhere. It is starting to make life on this planet very difficult, and in some places impossible. And it\u2019s on target to get far, far worse.\n\nHere\u2019s the second-biggest thing happening on our planet right now: finally, finally, renewable energy, mostly from the sun and wind, seems to be reaching some sort of takeoff point. By some calculations, we\u2019re now putting up a nuclear plant\u2019s worth of solar panels every day. In California, there are now enough solar farms and wind turbines that day after day this spring and summer they supplied more than 100% of the state\u2019s electric needs for long stretches; there are now enough batteries on the grid that they become the biggest source of power after dark. In China it looks as if carbon emissions may have peaked \u2013 they\u2019re six years ahead of schedule on the effort to build out renewables.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the third biggest thing in the months ahead: the American presidential election, which looks as if it is going down to the wire \u2013 and which may have the power to determine how high the temperature goes and how fast we turn to clean power.\n\nDonald Trump gave an interview last week, in which he laid out his understanding of climate change:\n\n\u201cYou know, when I hear these poor fools talking about global warming. They don\u2019t call it that any more, they call it climate change because you know, some parts of the planet are cooling and warming, and it didn\u2019t work. So they finally got it right, they just call it climate change. They used to call it global warming. You know, years ago they used to call it global cooling. In the 1920s they thought the planet was going to freeze. Now they think the planet\u2019s going to burn up. And we\u2019re still waiting for the 12 years. You know we\u2019re down almost to the end of the 12-year period, you understand that, where these lunatics that know nothing, they weren\u2019t even good students at school, they didn\u2019t even study it, they predict, they said we have 12 years to live. And people didn\u2019t have babies because they said \u2013 it\u2019s so crazy. But the problem isn\u2019t the fact that the oceans in 500 years will raise a quarter of an inch, the problem is nuclear weapons. It\u2019s nuclear warming \u2026 These poor fools talk about global warming all the time, you know the planet\u2019s going to global warm to a point where the oceans will rise an eighth of an inch in 355 years, you know, they have no idea what\u2019s going to happen. It\u2019s weather.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve quoted this at length because this could again be the most important man on the planet, talking about the most important issue the planet has ever faced. And he\u2019s gotten every word of it wrong. It\u2019s gibberish.\n\nView image in fullscreen Hummer electric vehicles on a production line in Detroit, Michigan, on 17 November 2021. Composite: Jonathan Ernst/Reuters/Guardian Design Team\n\nBut it\u2019s gibberish in the service of something very important and very dangerous: doing all that he can to block the energy transition, in America and around the world. His friends at Project 2025 have laid out in considerable detail how you translate that gibberish into policy. It lays out in loving detail many of the steps his administration would use to bolster oil, gas and coal while sidetracking sun and wind. These include ending the effort to spur EV production in Detroit; ending support for renewables (Trump has promised to \u201ckill wind\u201d, whatever that means); and reversing a crucial 2009 finding from the EPA that carbon dioxide causes harm, a position that undergirds much of the federal effort to rein in climate pollution. He has also \u2013 chef\u2019s kiss \u2013 promised to close down the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, otherwise known as the people who measure how much the temperature is rising. That\u2019s on the grounds that those measurements are \u201cone of the main drivers of the climate change alarm industry\u201d.\n\n\u2018Drill, baby, drill\u2019\n\nIn return for this endless largesse (beginning on day one, Trump said, he would become a dictator in order to \u201cdrill, baby, drill\u201d), he has asked the industry for only (Austin Powers moment here) \u201cone billion dollars\u201d in campaign contributions. Big oil is doing its best. As the Washington Post reported a couple of weeks ago, Harold Hamm, one of the country\u2019s most prominent frackers, is working the phones to come up with as much cash as possible. Hamm is working \u201cincredibly hard to raise as much money as he can from the energy sector\u201d, said a Trump campaign aide. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten max-out checks from people we\u2019ve never gotten a dollar from before.\u201d\n\nCan Trump reverse the tide towards renewable energy? No, not entirely \u2013 it\u2019s too strong, based on the ever-falling cost of sun, wind and batteries. Even in Texas, HQ of the hydrocarbon cartel where the state legislature has tried to pass laws limiting renewables, the undeniable economics of clean power continue to surge. The Lone Star state is now leading the nation in installing batteries on its grid, a good thing given the ongoing spate of climate disasters that strain and stress the state\u2019s system.\n\nBut he can slow it down considerably. America\u2019s buildout of renewables is dependent, among other things, on overcoming the bewildering array of permitting requirements that make every transmission line a harrowing bureaucratic battle. At the moment, the Biden-Harris White House has a dedicated team at work, with senior officials assigned to senior projects, constantly bird-dogging them to make sure that they get built on schedule. That would disappear, replaced with a new set of bureaucrats deeply invested in making sure these projects didn\u2019t happen.\n\nAt least as bad would be the effect around the world. Last time, Trump withdrew America from the Paris climate accords, badly denting the momentum those talks had produced. This time he\u2019d do the same and more \u2013 he\u2019s promised, for instance, to end Biden\u2019s pause on liquefied natural gas export terminals. These are designed to take huge volumes of US gas and ship it to Asia, where it will undercut the move to renewables. It is the last real growth strategy the oil industry has, and it is the biggest greenhouse gas bomb on the planet.\n\nView image in fullscreen A flare burns off methane and other hydrocarbons as oil pumpjacks operate in the Permian Basin in Midland, Texas, 12 October 2021. Composite: David Goldman/AP/Guardian Design Team\n\nIn essence, Trump would give every other oligarch in the world \u2013 Vladimir Putin, the king of Saudi Arabia, and on down the list \u2013 license to keep pumping away. If the biggest historical emitter of greenhouse gases is not going to play a role, why should anyone else feel any pressure? As Project 2025 quite clearly declares, Trump would \u201crescind all climate policies from its foreign aid programs\u201d and \u201ccease its war on fossil fuels in the developing world\u201d. (Though Trump has claimed not to know anything about Project 2025.) The global climate talks in Brazil next year and the 2026 version in Australia \u2013 currently shaping up to be the last huge chance for global cooperation \u2013 would be turned on their heads.\n\nThere are ways to calculate the meaning of all this. The UK-based NGO Carbon Brief, for instance, said earlier this year that \u201ca victory for Donald Trump in November\u2019s presidential election could lead to an additional 4bn tonnes of US emissions by 2030 compared with Joe Biden\u2019s plans\u201d. Just for perspective, that\u2019s a lot: \u201cThis extra 4bn tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO2e) by 2030 would cause global climate damages worth more than $900bn, based on the latest US government valuations. For context, 4GtCO2e is equivalent to the combined annual emissions of the EU and Japan, or the combined annual total of the world\u2019s 140 lowest-emitting countries.\u201d It\u2019s like finding an extra continent full of greenhouse gases.\n\nBut worse than the totals is the timing. If a Trump administration was merely going to be a four-year interregnum, it would be annoying. But in fact it comes at precisely the moment when we need, desperately, acceleration. We\u2019re on the edge of breaking the planet\u2019s climate system \u2013 we can see it cracking in the poles (the Thwaites glacier now undermined by warm seawater), in the Atlantic (the great currents now starting to slow) and in the Amazon (where savannafication seems to be gathering speed). The earth\u2019s hydrological system \u2013 how water moves around the earth \u2013 has already gone kaflooey, as warm air holds far more water vapor than cold.\n\nThe world\u2019s climate scientists have done their best to set out a timetable: cut emissions in half by 2030 or see the possibilities of anything like the Paris pathway, holding temperature increases to 1.5C above preindustrial levels, disappear. That cut is on the bleeding edge of the technically possible, but only if everyone is acting in good faith. And the next presidential term will end in January of 2029, which is 11 months before 2030.\n\nIf we elect Donald Trump, we may feel the effects not for years, and not for a generation. We may read our mistake in the geological record a million years hence. This one really counts.",

        "text": "September 5, 2024, presidential campaign news\nABC News has officially announced the rules of next week\u2019s presidential debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump \u2014 meaning both candidates have agreed to the format, including that microphones will be muted while the other candidate is speaking.\n\nAdditionally, a virtual coin flip held this week was won by Trump, to determine podium placement and order of closing statements. Trump chose to offer the last closing statement, and Harris chose the right podium position on screen.\n\nWhether microphones would be cut was the last sticking point for the Harris campaign, after Trump\u2019s team had already agreed to the rules last week.\n\nOver the weekend, Harris posted on X that Trump is \u201csurrendering to his advisors who won\u2019t allow him to debate with a live microphone. If his own team doesn\u2019t have confidence in him, the American people definitely can\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are running for President of the United States. Let\u2019s debate in a transparent way \u2014 with the microphones on the whole time,\u201d she added.\n\nLast week Trump said at a campaign stop that while they had already agreed to the rules, he didn\u2019t mind if the mics were on.\n\nThe ABC News debate rules largely mirror those used by CNN in its presidential debate between President Joe Biden and Trump in June, when the Biden campaign, at the time, was the one that advocated for muted microphones.\n\nIn addition to the muted microphones, the rules state there will be no audience, the candidates will not be permitted to have written notes, no staff can visit them during the two commercial breaks and they cannot ask questions of one another.",

        "text": "Republicans set stage for state challenges if Trump loses election\nBefore voters even begin casting ballots, Democrats and Republicans are engaged in a sprawling legal fight over the 2024 election through a series of court disputes that could even run past Nov. 5 if results are close.\n\nRepublicans filed more than 100 lawsuits challenging various aspects of vote-casting after being chastised repeatedly by judges in 2020 for bringing complaints about how the election was run only after votes were tallied.\n\nAfter Donald Trump made \u201d election integrity \u201d a key part of his party\u2019s platform following his false claims of widespread voter fraud in 2020, the Republican National Committee says it has more than 165,000 volunteers ready to watch the polls.\n\nDemocrats are countering with what they are calling \u201cvoter protection,\u201d rushing to court to fight back against the GOP cases and building their own team with over 100 staffers, several hundred lawyers and what they say are thousands of volunteers.\n\nREAD MORE: How Trump has made election lies a key feature of his campaign\n\nDespite the flurry of litigation, the cases have tended to be fairly small-bore, with few likely impacts for most voters.\n\n\u201cWhen you have all this money to spend on litigation, you end up litigating less and less important stuff,\u201d said Derek Muller, a law professor at Notre Dame University.\n\nThe stakes would increase dramatically should Trump lose and try to overturn the results. That\u2019s what he attempted in 2020, but the court system rejected him across the board. Trump and his allies lost more than 60 lawsuits trying to reverse President Joe Biden\u2019s win.\n\nWhether they could be successful this year depends on the results, experts said. A gap of about 10,000 votes \u2014 roughly the number that separated Biden and Trump in Arizona and Georgia in 2020 \u2014 is almost impossible to reverse through litigation. A closer one of a few hundred votes, like the 547-vote margin that separated George W. Bush and Al Gore in Florida in 2000, is much more likely to hinge on court rulings about which ballots are legitimate.\n\n\u201cIf he loses, he\u2019s going to claim that he won. That goes without saying,\u201d Rick Hasen, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, said of Trump. \u201cIf it looks like what we had last time \u2026 I expect we\u2019ll see the same kind of thing.\u201d\n\nTrump has done nothing to discourage that expectation, saying he would accept the results of the election only if it\u2019s \u201cfree and fair,\u201d raising the possibility it would not be, something he continues to falsely contend was the case in 2020. He also continues to insist that he could only lose due to fraud.\n\n\u201cThe only way they can beat us is to cheat,\u201d Trump said at a Las Vegas rally in June.\n\nTo be clear, there was no widespread fraud in 2020 or any election since then. Reviews, recounts and audits in the battleground states where Trump disputed his loss reaffirmed that Biden won. And Trump\u2019s attorney general said there was no evidence that fraud tipped the election.\n\nTrump installed his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, as co-chair of the Republican National Committee, which then named attorney Christina Bobb as the head of its election integrity division. Bobb is a former reporter for the conservative One America News Network who has been indicted by Arizona\u2019s attorney general for being part of an effort to promote a slate of Trump electors in the state, even though Biden won it.\n\nEchoing Trump, the RNC said it\u2019s trying to counter Democratic mischief.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s election integrity effort is dedicated to protecting every legal vote, mitigating threats to the voting process and securing the election,\u201d RNC spokeswoman Claire Zunk said in a statement. \u201cWhile Democrats continue their election interference against President Trump and the American people, our operation is confronting their schemes and preparing for November.\u201d\n\nThis time around, Democrats say they\u2019re prepared for whatever Republicans might do.\n\n\u201cFor four years, Donald Trump and his MAGA allies have been scheming to sow distrust in our elections and undermine our democracy so they can cry foul when they lose,\u201d Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon, Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 campaign manager, said in a statement. \u201cBut also for four years, Democrats have been preparing for this moment, and we are ready for anything.\u201d\n\nThe highest-profile litigation so far has been in Georgia, over new rules from a Republican-appointed majority on the State Board of Elections, which has echoed Trump\u2019s conspiracy theories. The rules could allow members of local election boards to try to refuse to certify results, a gambit Trump supporters have tried, unsuccessfully, to reverse losses in 2020 and 2022.\n\nA Trump-aligned group sued to have courts declare that election board members have that power while Democrats sued to overturn the new rules. GOP Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger has questioned the wisdom of the board changing procedures so close to the election. Legal experts say the state board\u2019s rules conflict with longstanding state law that certification is not optional.\n\nWhether local boards delay or refuse to certify the results from the upcoming election has been a growing concern, especially after a handful of local officials took that step during this year\u2019s primaries. But experts say the fears of a certification crisis are overblown, in large part because most state laws are clear that state or local boards must certify the official results brought to them by election offices. The courtroom remains the most important venue for candidates who want to challenge results.\n\n\u201cTrying to deny certification is a really poorly thought out theory,\u201d Ben Ginsberg, a Republican election lawyer, said on a Thursday call with reporters. \u201cIt has never worked.\u201d\n\nThe litigation to date has often been about relatively esoteric matters, but some cases could have implications after November if Trump loses. The RNC has filed lawsuits in Michigan, Nevada and North Carolina alleging the states need to remove inactive or ineligible voters from their rolls. Late last month, Republicans sued North Carolina over a favorite issue \u2014 the risk of noncitizens voting, which is rare. They contend the state wasn\u2019t doing enough to safeguard against it.\n\nSo far none of the claims have succeeded. But if Trump loses in those states by a narrow margin, that sort of pre-election litigation could pave the way for him to claim in court that the vote was invalid.\n\nThe other area that could have ramifications in November and beyond is whether mail ballots arriving after Election Day can be counted. Nineteen states allow that as long as the ballots are sent before polls close. The RNC sued to overturn this provision in Nevada and Mississippi, but both cases were dismissed by judges.\n\nThe RNC appealed those cases, and the first is scheduled to be heard by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals later this month. It\u2019s the sort of issue that could end up before the U.S. Supreme Court. Some Trump allies in 2020 hoped the court would declare him the winner, but the late-arriving mail ballot litigation at the time showed the limits of that tactic.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the state had to count mail ballots that arrived up to four days after Election Day. Republicans then appealed that ruling to the nation\u2019s highest court, and late-arriving mail was counted separately in November 2020 while everyone waited for the Supreme Court to weigh in.\n\nIn the end, the Supreme Court didn\u2019t take up the case. Trump lost Pennsylvania by more than 80,000 votes, so the 10,000 late-arriving mail ballots wouldn\u2019t have even made a difference.",

The survey, taken between August 23 and September 3, shows Harris leading in four swing states , while Trump has a slight edge in three, all within the margin of error Harris holds a slim advantage in Michigan, Nevada, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. In Michigan, she leads by five points with 48% to Trump's 43%. Nevada sees her ahead by three points at 49% to 46%, the same margin appears in Wisconsin where she stands at 47% to Trump\u2019s 44%. Pennsylvania remains tightly contested, with Harris leading by just one point, 46% to 45% among registered voters.Trump is ahead in three southern states: Georgia, Arizona, and North Carolina. In both Arizona and Georgia, he leads by two points, 47% to 45%. North Carolina shows a marginal advantage with Trump at 47% and Harris at 46%.\"Even compared to March, Harris was running ahead or even in each state. She was performing on par with or better than Biden\u2019s 2020 results in these battlegrounds,\" said Carl Bialik, Vice President of Data Science at YouGov. \"If these leads held and the rest of the states voted similarly to 2020, Harris would have won the electoral college.\"CNN's recent polling further complicates the scenario, showing no decisive lead in Georgia, Nevada, and Pennsylvania. Harris, however, is ahead in Wisconsin by 50% to 44% and in Michigan with 48% to Trump\u2019s 43%. Conversely, Trump holds a five-point lead in Arizona, leading 49% to 44%.Aggregated poll data from The Hill/Decision Desk HQ reveals Harris leading Trump by 4 percentage points, 49.7% to 45.7%. A USA TODAY/Suffolk Poll conducted from August 25-28 indicated Harris at 48% and Trump at 43%, within the margin of error.Despite these polling variations, betting markets\u2014though not legally regulated in the U.S.\u2014showed Harris maintaining a slight lead following the Democratic National Convention.The YouGov poll included 900 respondents each in Arizona and Wisconsin, 800 in Nevada, and 1,000 in the other states, with a margin of error ranging from 3 to 5 percent.As the race intensifies, these battleground states will be pivotal, with both candidates striving to secure every vote.",

        "text": "Election Security: U.S. Government\u2019s Efforts to Protect the 2024 U.S. Election from Foreign Malign Influence\nTHE WASHINGTON FOREIGN PRESS CENTER, WASHINGTON, D.C.\n\nMODERATOR: Good afternoon, everyone. Hello and welcome to the Washington Foreign Press Center\u2019s briefing on election security. My name is Gini Staab at the U.S. Department of State and I\u2019ll be the moderator for today\u2019s briefing. This briefing is on background, and on the call today we have several experts \u2013 three ODNI officials, one CISA official, and one FBI official. They will self-identify, and you can attribute their remarks to an ODNI official, a CISA official, or an FBI official.\n\nBy participating in today\u2019s call you are agreeing to these ground rules. We will share a transcript of the briefing later today, and for journalists joining us, please take a moment now to rename yourself in the chat window with your name, outlet, and country. And following their opening remarks, I will open the floor to questions.\n\nAnd with that, I\u2019m going to turn it over to ODNI to start us off. Thank you.\n\nODNI OFFICIAL ONE: Hello. This is ODNI. I\u2019d like to start and note that we\u2019re 60 days out from the election, and as we approach November, we observe IC \u2013 we observe foreign actors ramping up their election influence efforts.\n\nIn this update, we will discuss foreign election interference versus foreign election influence, and provide updates on the big three election influence actors. I\u2019ll start with election interference versus influence.\n\nThe IC \u2013 the U.S. Intelligence Community \u2013 reserves the term \u201celection interference\u201d for efforts to degrade or disrupt the United States\u2019s ability to hold an election. This is separate from election influence, which has been the focus of our updates so far. We define election influence as efforts to shape election outcomes or undermine democratic processes.\n\nWe have not observed any foreign actors seeking to interfere in the conduct of the 2024 elections. Nonetheless, this is a top priority in the IC, and our interagency election partners remain vigilant in case foreign actors change their approach. In particular, we are monitoring for any activities that could enable election interference, especially cyber or physical disruptions of election infrastructure.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note the challenge of election interference. We assess it would be difficult for a foreign actor to manipulate the election processes at a large enough scale to impact the outcome of a federal election without detection. This detection includes intelligence collection, post-election audits, or physical and cyber security monitoring of the decentralized and diverse election infrastructure across the country.\n\nInstead of interference, the IC assesses adversaries so far are focused on using information operations and propaganda to try to shape voter preferences or undermine confidence in the election. We continue to monitor efforts to cast doubt on the electoral process or claims that they have interfered in the process when they have not actually done so, a tactic known as perception hacking.\n\nIn addition, we\u2019d note that reports of cyber espionage against election or campaign infrastructure do not necessarily mean that an actor is trying to affect the conduct of an election. Foreign actors sometimes use cyber tools to collect information that helps them tailor their influence messages to certain U.S. audiences, or embarrass or denigrate particular candidates through leaks. For example, we have seen foreign actors work to compromise political entities, and foreign actors \u2013 all key foreign actors have engaged in such efforts during this election cycle.\n\nNow transitioning to the big three foreign influence actors, Russia, Iran, and China are all trying by some measure to exacerbate divisions in U.S. society for their own benefit, and see election periods as moments of vulnerability. These actors most likely judge that amplifying controversial issues and rhetoric that seeks to divide Americans can serve their interests by making the U.S. and its democratic system look weak, and by keeping the U.S. Government distracted with internal issues instead of pushing back on their hostile behavior globally.\n\nThe IC continues to assess that Russia is the pre-eminent and most active foreign influence threat to this year\u2019s U.S. elections. Russia is looking to amplify divisive rhetoric and influence electoral outcomes, which both speak to Moscow\u2019s broader foreign policy goals of weakening the United States and undermining Washington\u2019s support for Ukraine. As this week\u2019s U.S. Government actions further demonstrated, Russia is using actors such as the U.S.-sanctioned organizations the Social Design Agency and ANO Dialogue and the state media outlet RT to covertly amplify and stoke domestic divisions and push for Russia\u2019s preferred electoral outcomes. RT has built and used networks of U.S. and other Western personalities to create and disseminate Russia-friendly narratives while trying to mask the content in authentic Americans\u2019 free speech. These actors, among others, are supporting Moscow\u2019s efforts to influence voter preference in favor of the former president and diminish the prospects of the Vice President. These actors use methods such as targeted online influence operations on social media and websites that portray themselves as legitimate news sites.\n\nNow moving to Iran, the IC assesses that Iran is making a greater effort than in the past to influence this year\u2019s elections, even as its tactics and approaches are similar to prior cycles. Like Russia, Iran has a multi-pronged approach that looks to stoke discord and undermine confidence in our electoral process. Tehran has also sought cyber access to individuals with direct ties to the presidential campaigns of both political parties, while elements have also denigrated the former president. Iran has a suite of tools at its disposal, as demonstrated in recent reports outlining Iran\u2019s cyber operations, including the hack-and-leak operation against the former president\u2019s campaign. Iran is also conducting covert social media operations using fake personas, and is using AI to help publish inauthentic news articles.\n\nChina, for its part, is focused on influencing down-ballot races. The IC continues to assess that China is not attempting to influence the presidential race. China is also continuing its longstanding efforts to build relationships with U.S. officials and entities at state and local levels because it perceives Washington as largely opposed to China. This view likely informs Beijing\u2019s greater interest in some non-presidential races. The IC is aware of PRC attempts to influence U.S. down-ballot races by focusing on candidates it views as particularly threatening to core PRC security interests. China\u2019s influence actors have also continued small-scale efforts in social media to engage U.S. audiences on divisive political issues, including protests about the Israel-Gaza conflict, and promote negative stories about both political parties.\n\nIn closing, there\u2019s one last point we raise in this update, and that is we are seeing a number of countries beyond these three actors that are considering activities that at minimum test the boundaries of election influence. Such activities include lobbying political figures to try to curry favor with them in the event that they are elected to office.\n\nWith that, I\u2019ll turn to my colleague.\n\nODNI OFFICIAL TWO: Hi. This is ODNI. Thanks so much for joining us. As you may be aware, ODNI\u2019s Foreign Malign Influence Center houses the Election Threats Executive and leads intelligence efforts to protect the election from foreign malign influence and interference. ODNI is working proactively to posture the Intelligence Community to address generative AI-enabled foreign malign influence campaigns; to communicate current information on election threats to critical stakeholders, including election officials, civil society leaders, and the American people. This update is part of that effort.\n\nWe\u2019re also working to exchange information with industry on a voluntary basis regarding evolving foreign threat actor tools, tactics, and procedures to ensure that both we and they have an up-to-date perspective on the landscape. We also continue to convene interagency election security \u2013 the interagency election security community on a very regular basis and to implement the notification framework, which you\u2019ll hear about, among other things, from my colleague in a moment.\n\nAll of this work both draws on and facilitates collaboration across the Intelligence Community and the U.S. Government in what is truly a tightly coordinated whole-of-government effort. Let me turn it now to my colleague.\n\nODNI OFFICIAL THREE: Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us today. The interagency election security community remains laser-focused on implementing the presidentially approved notification framework regarding election influence and interference targeting U.S. elections, which is the IC\u2019s primary mechanism for responding to intelligence on foreign malign influence and interference threats to U.S. elections. This group is engaging to review relevant intelligence under the framework to determine best actions to mitigate threats.\n\nThe election security group has been routinely meeting to review intelligence and evaluate the need for non-public notifications to targets of malign influence operations and also public notifications. We use these meetings to inform each other of our outreach activities, whether to state and local officials, the media, Congress, or the private sector, as well as to deconflict analytic production plans. We maintain an active cadence of providing non-public notifications and general threat briefing to targets of malign influence.\n\nIn an effort to be as transparent as possible, we are routinely engaging with state and local election officials and continue to pursue opportunities to update the American people. To that end, we conducted our first public notification this election cycle regarding Iranian cyber operations targeting presidential campaigns. On receipt of intelligence, the election security group implemented an expedited process to review the information and determine the course of action, leading to a quick public notification. We remain committed to providing periodic unclassified updates.\n\nI want to underscore that there is an extraordinarily high level of coordination on election security issues, which each organization bringing different authorities and capabilities that are useful to addressing the broad challenges we face. Thank you.\n\nMODERATOR: Thank you for those remarks, and now I\u2019d like to open it up for questions. A reminder for journalists: Please be sure your screenname includes your name and media outlet, and to ask a question, click the raise hand icon at the bottom of your screen. And to start, please, we\u2019ll go to Dmitry Anopchenko from Inter TV Ukraine.\n\nQUESTION: Oh, yeah, hello. Thank you very much for doing this. Gentlemen and lady, anyone who would like to take my questions, two short questions, if I may. Firstly, how would you describe the threats to integrity of the American elections? Would one expect that Russia may not only use the propaganda but interfere directly, like hacking the candidates, the voting machines? Are you looking to those scenarios?\n\nAnd secondly, the most important: How would you describe the connection between Russia and the hackers, both who are the part of the GRU, Russian military intelligence like 29155, and so-called independent hackers like those who attacked Ukraine recently? Thanks very much.\n\nODNI OFFICIAL ONE: Hi there, this is ODNI. You had two questions. On the first question, just to reiterate that we have not observed any foreign actor seeking to interfere in the conduct of this election, but it\u2019s something we are constantly monitoring and is a top priority, especially in case foreign actors change their approach.\n\nAs to your second question, we have no further information on individual Russian actors engaged in this activity beyond what was released already.\n\nMODERATOR: Thank you. For the next question, we\u2019ll go to Farrah Tomazin from the Sydney Morning Herald, Australia.\n\nQUESTION: Hi there. Can you hear me?\n\nMODERATOR: Yes we can.\n\nQUESTION: Excellent. Look, you mentioned a number of countries beyond Russia, Iran, and China considering activities that test the boundaries of election influence. Can you please elaborate a bit on which countries are they and what tactics are sort of being applied?\n\nSecondly, to what extent are you liaising with other countries that may become targets of election influence? For example, my country, Australia, is about to go into an election within months of the U.S. presidential election. Are discussions being held between our intelligence agencies here and other countries? Thank you.\n\nODNI OFFICIAL ONE: Hi there. Thank you for the question. This is ODNI again. As to your first question about other countries engaged in this activity \u2013 as you said, that test the boundaries \u2013 we are not sharing additional countries at this time. But we\u2019d note that the IC\u2019s focus is on foreign election influence activity or related activity regardless of the actor\u2019s relationship with the U.S. Government. And we focus on these three countries, the \u2013 Iran, Russia, and China \u2013 because they\u2019re the most capable and active foreign influence actors in prior election cycles.\n\nODNI OFFICIAL TWO: And I can add that we have regular exchanges with partners around the world to exchange information on threats and to learn from one another about how to mitigate them.\n\nMODERATOR: Thank you. And we\u2019ll take one advanced question please from Mohamed Maher from Al Masry Al Youm Newspaper/ON TV in Egypt: \u201cCan you provide insights into how the U.S. Government is collaborating with major technology companies such as Facebook and X \u2013 previously Twitter \u2013 to enhance cyber security measures and prevent the spread of disinformation related to the elections? Is there a coordinated effort between U.S. intelligence agencies and social media platforms to monitor for foreign malign influence campaigns ahead of the elections?\u201d\n\nODNI OFFICIAL TWO: Hi, this is ODNI. From our perspective, our exchanges are focused on two things. One is evolving foreign threat actor techniques, tactics, and procedures; and the other is just share information on authentication and attribution approaches. These exchanges are voluntary. We don\u2019t ask or expect that any action would be taken based on the information that we share. And these conversations happen at the strategic level.\n\nMODERATOR: Thank you much. Next, we\u2019ll go to Kelly Malone from the Canada press \u2013 Canadian Press. Sorry.\n\nQUESTION: Hello. Thank you so much for taking the time today. So this week, there was the unsealed indictment against two Russian nationals accusing of them setting up a conservative media outlet as a front for pro-Kremlin propaganda, and it acknowledged the founder is Canadian and the parent company is also based in Canada. So what, if anything, is Canada doing to assist this kind of investigation and this specific investigation? Are they actively \u2013 are Canadian authorities actively investigating the parent company? Have you asked them to do that, or are you doing that yourself? And why are there no charges for the founders when in the indictment it says that \u2013 it alleges that they knew they were, quote, \u201cthe Russians,\u201d and referred to them in the same way when they were contracted by RT.\n\nODNI OFFICIAL ONE: This is \u2014\n\nODNI OFFICIAL TWO: Or we turn to FBI.\n\nODNI OFFICIAL THREE: Yeah, we\u2019ll leave it to the FBI official to answer that question.\n\nODNI OFFICIAL TWO: We\u2019ll come back to that question. We think the FBI official may be having a technical problem, and so we can perhaps come back to that question if it\u2019s okay.\n\nMODERATOR: Absolutely. Thank you so much. One more advance question from Cristobal Vasquez Ramirez from France 24 Espanol, France: \u201cDo you think Israeli PR and media organizations have also had considerable influence in this election process? Why is Israeli state media organizations not considered foreign actors in this case?\u201d\n\nODNI OFFICIAL ONE: Hi there. We focus on all foreign actors that seek to influence the election, and we\u2019re not prepared to discuss further about specific countries beyond what we released. But I would note that regardless of the country\u2019s relationship with the U.S. Government, if they are conducting foreign election \u2013 or election influence activity, we would watch their activities and address it appropriately.\n\nMODERATOR: Thank you. Next, we\u2019ll go to Alex from the Turan News Agency, Azerbaijan.\n\nQUESTION: Hi, thank you so much, Gini. And I appreciate all three officials for their time. Alex Raufoglu from Turan News Agency. On Ukraine, do all these three actors parrot same narrative when it comes to U.S. support to Ukraine? And how would you describe that? And are you aware of reflection of that narrative in international media, whether it\u2019s bouncing back to the wider region, not only staying in the U.S.? Thank you so much.\n\nODNI OFFICIAL ONE: Hi, this is ODNI. Clarification \u2013 are you referring to Ukrainian narratives in the United States or efforts in Ukraine? Because our focus is not on Ukraine \u2013 it\u2019s on efforts against the U.S. election, of \u2013 which, of course, Ukraine comes up in some of the influence narratives.\n\nQUESTION: I apologize; I had some audio issue. Fair point. No, I was talking about the foreign actors pushing their narrative within the United States, whether it\u2019s through social media or other means. So that narrative are \u2013 is Iran, Russia, and China \u2013 are they parroting same narrative, or they have different ways of approaching U.S. support to Ukraine? Thank so much.\n\nODNI OFFICIAL ONE: Hi there. Thank you for that clarification. Russia is the primary actor focusing on amplifying narratives in an effort to diminish Washington\u2019s support for Ukraine. It is not a primary narrative of the other actors you mentioned.\n\nMODERATOR: Thank you. So we\u2019ll take one more advance question, please, from Fouad Youcefi, the Swedish Broadcasting SVT from Sweden: \u201cBriefing will focus on foreign malign influence, but would love to hear briefers briefly discussing domestic threat environment as well, if possible.\u201d\n\nODNI OFFICIAL ONE: Yeah.\n\nODNI OFFICIAL THREE: All right, if FBI is on the line, we\u2019d love to have you chime In. If not, we can also have CISA proceed.\n\nCISA OFFICIAL: Hi there. This is CISA. I\u2019m happy to jump in, but I do apologize. We only heard part of the question. Could they repeat the question, please?\n\nMODERATOR: Yes, absolutely. Sorry. Fouad Youcefi from Swedish Broadcasting in Sweden asks: \u201cThe briefing will focus on foreign malign influence, but would love to hear briefers briefly discuss domestic threat environment as well, if possible.\n\nCISA OFFICIAL: Okay, thanks, Gini. So this is the CISA official. So what I would say is with respect to the work that we are doing with election infrastructure partners across the country, we are working with them to identify and mitigate the full range of threats they may be facing, from the physical to the cyber to the operational security, and really ensuring the security and resiliency of our nation\u2019s election infrastructure. And I say that just to clarify a bit of CISA\u2019s role for those who are not as familiar. CISA serves as the United States\u2019s civilian cyber defense agency, and we also serve as the U.S. federal government\u2019s national coordinator for critical infrastructure security and resilience.\n\nWithin that mission space, we also serve as the federal government lead for ensuring the security and resiliency of our nation\u2019s election infrastructure. And so in that capacity, we do a tremendous amount of work with election officials at the state and local level, as well as our election vendors who provide the election infrastructure and utilization across the country, to identify, defend against, and ensure effective response to, again, that full range of cyber, physical, and operational security risks that they may encounter.\n\nAnd we do this through a variety of ways to ensure their readiness, so our stakeholders understand the threats they are facing, most importantly the steps they can do to mitigate those, and then providing not just services but also trainings to ensure they\u2019re able to really practice and rehearse those key steps, to include their incident response plans, for that effective response during any point of the election cycle. And so when we talk about the domestic threat landscape, it really is a comprehensive approach to security and resiliency that matches the complexity of the threat environment.\n\nMODERATOR: Thank you so much. Next we\u2019ll go to Sang-ho Song from the Yonhap News Agency, Korea.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you very much for doing this. You mentioned three countries \u2013 China, Russia, and Iran \u2013 as foreign actors. But have you detected any signs or any possibility of North Korea trying to influence the U.S. election in any way, given North Korea\u2019s notorious for malign cyberspace activities and so on? Or are you ruling out that possibility of North Korea\u2019s potential influence operations? Thank you.\n\nODNI OFFICIAL ONE: This is ODNI. We have no further information to share on that.\n\nMODERATOR: Thank you so much. And likely our last question is going to Shinichi Akiyama from Mainichi Newspapers, Japan.\n\nQUESTION: Hi, thanks for doing this. My question is about China. You said that China is more focusing on the local election, like state or county or this kind. And what is the aim, what is the purpose, what is their method, why they are doing that locally?\n\nODNI OFFICIAL ONE: Hi there, this is ODNI. Our update discusses that China is working to build relationships at local levels to oppose individuals that it perceives as particularly anti-Beijing. And this perception that most of Washington is anti-Beijing is one of the drivers to push them to try to influence down-ballot races.\n\nWe would note that this view of China\u2019s activity is consistent with our assessment of their activity in 20 \u2013 the 2022 midterms, where we similarly assessed that China had tacitly approved efforts to try to influence a handful of midterm races involving members of both U.S. political parties. Beijing\u2019s focus was to counter U.S. politicians viewed as anti-China and to support others viewed as pro-China, and that activity that we saw in 2022 is similar to that which is included in today\u2019s update.\n\nMODERATOR: Thank you so much. I realize that\u2019s all the time that our briefers have for today, so this ends our Q&A session. And we\u2019ll try to get a written response back to you for Canada, please.\n\nAs a reminder, this briefing has been on the record and you can attribute their remarks to an ODNI official, a CISA official, and an FBI official, as noted. I wanted to give a very special thanks to our briefers for sharing their time with us today, and to the journalists who\u2019ve joined us. Thank you so much. This concludes today\u2019s briefing.",

        "text": "How the electorate has changed in key states and what it could mean this election\nHow the electorate has changed in key states and what it could mean this election\n\nThere have been significant population shifts in the last two decades in this country, and that has had a big impact on U.S. politics.\n\nThese demographic shifts are, in large measure, the reason why some states, like Ohio and Iowa, are no longer swing states \u2014 and why some have come on the map, like Georgia and Arizona.\n\nThese demographic shifts have also coincided with shifts within the parties. Republicans have been able to win over larger percentages of whites without college degrees, while Democrats have gained with college-educated white voters and Asian Americans, while also largely maintaining advantages with Black voters and Latinos.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nStill, issues matter. The fundamentals on various issues favor Republicans, from views of the economy to immigration, which is why demographics are not necessarily destiny. But they are a crucial part of explaining the political shifts, where the campaigns are focused, and why the seven states everyone is watching most closely are, in fact, the current crop of swing states.\n\nNPR utilized data and projections from William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution, as well as presidential exit polls conducted by Edison Research to do a deeper dive into the data and see what it could mean for this year\u2019s presidential election.\n\nHere are eight important findings:\n\nLoading...\n\n1. White voters without college degrees have declined as a share of the electorate everywhere pretty significantly since 2008, while Latinos, AAPI voters and whites with degrees have increased dramatically\n\nWhites without degrees were a majority of voters overall in 2008, but are now projected to be less than 40% in 2024.\n\nThey are down dramatically in all three Blue Wall states as well since 2008: 12 points in Pennsylvania, 8 in Michigan and 7 in Wisconsin. This is happening without much change to nonwhite groups in the Blue Wall states.\n\nAmong the seven swing states, the increase in Latinos has been especially acute in Arizona and Nevada, where they now represent 3-in-10 eligible voters in Arizona and 1 in 5 in Nevada. At the same time, white non-college voters are down significantly in the four Sun Belt swing states since 2008: 14 points in Nevada, 13 in Arizona, 13 in North Carolina and 10 in Georgia.\n\nLoading...\n\n2. White non-college voters, though, continue to be the largest portion of eligible voters in all of the key swing states\n\nIn the Blue Wall states, white non-college voters make up a significant share of the eligible voting population \u2014 half or more.\n\nTrump turned them out in greater numbers in 2020 than in 2016. But Biden was able to win all three Blue Wall states because he ate into Trump\u2019s margins with the group in Wisconsin and Michigan and kept it even in Pennsylvania, while also turning out nonwhite groups in his favor.\n\nIn fact, Biden did better than Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic nominee, with white non-college voters in five of the seven swing states.\n\n\n\n3. Democrats have held up in the Blue Wall states because white non-college voters vote differently there than in the South \u2014 and the Blue Wall has more college-educated white voters than at any other time\n\nWhite voters without degrees in the two southern swing states, Georgia and North Carolina, are much more conservative.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nOn average in the Blue Wall states, Trump won whites without degrees 61%-38% in 2020, according to exit polls. In Georgia and North Carolina, on the other hand, Trump won them by an average of 79%-21%.\n\nThat's a 23-point margin vs. 58 points.\n\nIn Arizona and Nevada, whites without degrees voted more like those in the Blue Wall.\n\nWhites with degrees, meanwhile, are on the rise in the Blue Wall states \u2014 up 8 points in Pennsylvania, 6 points in Wisconsin and 5 points in Michigan since 2008. In Wisconsin, they're up 4 points just since 2020.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just the Blue Wall, either. White college-educated voters shifted heavily away from Trump almost everywhere. In Georgia, North Carolina and Arizona, they moved away from Trump by double-digits \u2014 by 30 points in Georgia, 19 in North Carolina, 13 in Arizona and 9 in Nevada.\n\nDemocrats\u2019 performance with college-educated white voters is one underreported reason the party continues to stay competitive against Trump.\n\n\n\n4. The Sun Belt continues to diversify, and that has put it on the map for Democrats\n\nWhite voters are down double-digits since 2008 as a share of eligible voters in Nevada, Arizona and North Carolina, and 9 in Georgia. It's a huge change that has put these states in play.\n\nLatinos and AAPI voters are up significantly in these places as well. Latinos are up 10 points in Arizona, 7 in Nevada, have doubled their eligible-voter population in Georgia and quadrupled in North Carolina since 2008.\n\nOf the swing states, AAPI voters could have the largest impact in Nevada, where they are now almost 10% of the eligible voter population. While AAPI voters are smaller portions of the electorate in other swing states, they have doubled as a share of eligible voters in Arizona, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin in that time.\n\nThat trend is only going to continue, because, as of right now, a majority of those under 18 are nonwhite. Gen Z is forecast to be the last generation that is majority white .\n\nNotably, these demographic shifts have helped Democrats to statewide victories for the Senate and governorships. Six of the eight Sun Belt swing-state senators now either are Democrats or caucus with them. That\u2019s a big change from 2008, when seven of the eight were Republicans.\n\n(In the Blue Wall, five of the six senators are Democrats, the same margin as 2008.) Overall, five of the seven swing-state governors are also currently Democrats.\n\n\n\nSponsor Message\n\n5. The Sun Belt rises in the East \u2014 while Georgia and North Carolina are similar, they are also different in key ways\n\nBoth of these Sun Belt states are diverse, have similar Latino, AAPI and white non-college populations.\n\nBut two things make them distinct from each other: Georgia has a larger Black population, and North Carolina has more white college-educated voters.\n\nNorth Carolina white voters with degrees also vote more for Democrats than those in Georgia do. In 2020, for example, Trump won college-educated white voters in Georgia by 11 points, but Biden won them by 1 in North Carolina.\n\nThe size of the Black population in Georgia \u2014 1 in 3 eligible voters \u2014 also generally gives a Democrat a better chance than in North Carolina. That is part of the reason why both senators in Georgia are Democrats, but both in North Carolina are Republicans.\n\nDon't overlook the importance of reducing the margins with college-educated whites or Harris potentially winning them by bigger margins than in 2020, as lots of polls have shown this cycle, which could keep North Carolina\u2019s vote margin very close.\n\n\n\n6. How the West is being won (by Democrats)\n\nDemocrats have made major inroads in Arizona, while maintaining close but consistent victories in Nevada.\n\nLatinos are key in both places. Arizona\u2019s eligible-voter population is 28% Latino, up from 19% in 2008. Nevada is 20%, up from 13% in the same time period. As noted earlier, AAPI voters are also crucial in Nevada, up from 7% to 10% since 2008.\n\nThose increases are crucial for Democrats, especially in Nevada, where just 19% are whites with college degrees, the lowest of any of the seven states.\n\nIn fact, Nevada has the lowest level of college attainment of the seven states \u2014 just 27% have college degrees, which tends to make for a less politically engaged population and one that is most likely to engage now, post-Labor Day and up to Election Day.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIn other words, you can probably throw out all the polls up until Labor Day in Nevada.\n\n\n\n7. It's also important to look at who actually votes\n\nAbout 8 in 10 college-educated white voters cast ballots in presidential elections, compared to 6 in 10 or less of whites without degrees.\n\nLoading...\n\nTrump has turned out whites without degrees at higher rates than in the past \u2013 64% in 2020, for example. His campaign\u2019s theory is that it\u2019s a group Trump still has room to grow with.\n\nThat could be true, but turnout will likely be down overall compared to 2020 just by virtue of the fact that mail-in voting is not as widely available \u2014 and it\u2019s very difficult to buck turnout trends with lower-propensity voters, experts say.\n\nThat\u2019s partially why whites with degrees are 26% of the eligible voter population, but projected to be 32% of the actual voters in 2024. White non-college voters are projected to be higher than that at 38%, but that would be the closest the two groups have ever been.\n\nJust how big a change is that? In 2008, white voters without degrees were 51% of actual voters, compared to 28% of whites with degrees.\n\n\n\n8. Latinos continue to be underrepresented at the ballot box\n\nWhile Latinos are 14% of the eligible voter population overall, Brookings projects them to be just 11% in 2024.\n\nWhy? It tracks with history, including 2020, when Latinos made up 13% of eligible voters, but voted at less than 11%.\n\nStill, their continued increases, especially in the Southwest, make Latinos a politically powerful group.",

The debate will start at 9 p.m. on Tuesday, September 10, 2024, in Philadelphia at the National Constitution Center (NCC) at 6th and Arch Streets in Philadelphia. A map of these plans is available here.\n\nPublic Safety Updates\n\nThe City of Philadelphia has been planning for the November 5th General Election for several months with partners on the city, state, and federal levels. When the debate was announced in early August, Philadelphia Police and the Office of Emergency Management began focused meetings with many of those same departments and agencies to understand the impact on the city.\n\nThe Philadelphia Police Department remains committed to ensuring the safety and security of all during the upcoming event. In light of this, PPD has made adjustments to ensure that a significant number of resources will be deployed in the area to manage traffic and crowd control while maintaining order. Additionally, similar adjustments have been made to ensure that there will be adequate staffing throughout the city, allowing the department to continue providing quality police services to all Philadelphia residents.\n\nThe City\u2019s Emergency Operations Center, operated by the Office of Emergency Management, will be activated Tuesday to bring agencies together during the response. This allows for real-time decision-making and provides a common operating picture for departments and agencies involved in the response.\n\nFAA regulations prohibit sUAS/drone usage above crowds. If someone sees a drone, please report the location and description of the operator to the nearest public safety official.\n\n\n\nRoad Closures & Parking Restrictions\n\n\n\nThere will be closures for vehicular and pedestrian traffic, mass transit detours, and possible rolling street closures related to the event.\n\nSaturday, September 7 \u2013 Monday, September 9\n\nStarting Saturday, September 7 residents may experience increases to traffic and temporary lane closures in the area near and around the National Constitution Center as event-related preparation work is scheduled to begin and last throughout the weekend.\n\nTuesday, September 10 \u2013 Wednesday, September 11\n\nBeginning early morning Tuesday September 10, street closures will be in effect from Arch to Market Streets, between 4th and 7th Streets. Vehicular and pedestrian traffic will be allowed on 4th Street and Market Street. The 6th Street exit of I-676 eastbound will also be closed beginning Tuesday morning. I-676 westbound is expected to remain open but may close if necessary.\n\nNo one will be permitted inside those secure closure points. Arch and Race Streets will remain closed throughout the duration of the event. Closures will remain in effect until the event area is cleared which is expected Wednesday.\n\nEmployees who work inside the secure zone should access their building through an entry point at 7th and Arch Streets.\n\nAccess to eastbound lanes for the Ben Franklin Bridge from I-676 into New Jersey is slated to close after rush hour Tuesday for the debate. Westbound lanes of the Ben Franklin Bridge into Philadelphia will remain open at this time.\n\nAdditional temporary highway and street shutdowns and rolling road closures may be necessary on Tuesday due to public safety necessity and anticipated First Amendment demonstrations.\n\nExpect residual delays on surrounding roadways.\n\nPublic Transit\n\nDelays, detours, and changes to SEPTA mass transit schedules and stops will be published on the agency\u2019s Alert & Advisory webpage and social media.\n\nStay Updated\n\nRoad closures, reopening, and other information related to the debate will be published on the Philadelphia Office of Emergency Management, City of Philadelphia, and the Philadelphia Police Department\u2019s social media pages.

        "text": "Harris Or Trump? 'Nostradamus' Of US Presidential Elections Makes Final Prediction For 2024\nAllan Lichtman, often dubbed the \"Nostradamus\" of US Presidential Polls, has accurately predicted the outcome of nine of the last 10 presidential elections. Now, the expert has given his final verdict about the 2024 race. On Thursday, Mr Lichtman predicted that Kamala Harris would win the White House in November's poll. In a video for the New York Times, he said that the US vice president, who became the Democratic party's nominee after Joe Biden withdrew in July, would defeat former US President Donald Trump on November 5 and keep the White House in Democratic hands.\n\n\"The Democrats will hold on to the White House, and Kamala Harris will be the next president of the United States - at least, that's my prediction for this race,\" Mr Lichtman said in the video, per The Guardian.\n\nThe 77-year-old explained that he based his prediction on a historical index model he dubs the \"Keys to the White House\". This unique system analyses the political landscape through the lens of 13 true-false statements focused on the incumbent president's party. If six or more of the statements are false, then the challenger - in this case, Mr Trump - is predicted to win.\n\nAccording to him, Ms Harris has the advantage in eight \"keys\" while Mr Trump has three.\n\nThe 13 keys to the White House as designed by Mr Lichtman are as follows:\n\nParty Mandate: Post-midterm elections, the incumbent party secures more US House of Representatives seats than in the previous midterms.\n\nPost-midterm elections, the incumbent party secures more US House of Representatives seats than in the previous midterms. Nomination Contest: There's no significant challenge to the incumbent party's nomination.\n\nThere's no significant challenge to the incumbent party's nomination.

Third-party Factor: There's no noteworthy third-party or independent campaign.\n\nThere's no noteworthy third-party or independent campaign. Short-term Economic Stability: The economy doesn't face recession during the election period.\n\nThe economy doesn't face recession during the election period. Long-term Economic Growth: Real per capita economic growth equals or surpasses the average growth of the preceding two terms.\n\nReal per capita economic growth equals or surpasses the average growth of the preceding two terms. Policy Shift: The incumbent administration enacts major alterations in national policy.\n\nThe incumbent administration enacts major alterations in national policy. Social Stability: There's no prolonged social unrest throughout the term.\n\nThere's no prolonged social unrest throughout the term. Scandal-Free: The incumbent administration remains free from major scandals.\n\nThe incumbent administration remains free from major scandals.

Incumbent Charm: The incumbent party's candidate possesses charisma or enjoys national hero status.\n\nThe incumbent party's candidate possesses charisma or enjoys national hero status. Challenger Appeal: The opposing party's candidate lacks charisma or national hero status.\n\nMr Lichtman explained that Mr Harris gained from the absence of a strong third-party candidate following the demise of Robert F Kennedy Jr's independent campaign, positive short- and long-term economic indicators, major legislative achievements enacted by the Biden administration, and the absence of social unrest or scandal attached to the White House. According to the expert, Ms Harris was also favoured in not having to undergo a party nomination battle to succeed Mr Biden, as other candidates quickly lined up to endorse her before last month's Democratic national convention.\n\n\"But even if both foreign policy keys flipped false, that would mean that there were only five negative keys, which would not be enough for Donald Trump to regain the White House,\" Mr Lichtman said in the video.\n\nAlso Read | Putin Backs Kamala Harris For US Presidency, Says 'Admire Her Infectious Laugh'\n\nThis leaves Kamala Harris winning the White House, the expert continued. \"At least that's my prediction for this race, but the outcome is up to you, so get out and vote,\" he said.\n\nNotably, Mr Lichtman has been forecasting the results of US presidential elections since 1984 and claims to have accurately predicted all but one - George W Bush's contested triumph over Al Gore in 2000. The expert also correctly predicted that Donald Trump would win the 2016 election over Democrat Hillary Clinton. He even forecasted that Mr Trump would be impeached during his presidency - which he was, twice.",

        "summary": " The National President of the Fraternal Order of Police has endorsed Donald J. Trump for president of the United States . The FOP is the nation\u2019s oldest and largest law enforcement organization . In 2012, the FOP voted not to endorse a candidate .",
        "text": "FOP Endorses Trump!\nWashington, DC - Patrick Yoes, National President of the Fraternal Order of Police, announced today that the members of the FOP voted to endorse Donald J. Trump for President of the United States.\n\n\u201cPublic safety and border security will be important issues in the last months of this campaign,\u201d Yoes said. \u201cOur members carefully considered the positions of the candidates on the issues and there was no doubt\u2014zero doubt\u2014as to who they want as our President for the next four years: Donald J. Trump.\u201d\n\nThe FOP\u2019s endorsement process is unique in that every member has the opportunity, through our 46 State Lodges, to make their choice known to the National Trustee. Once informed by the membership as to their choice, the National Trustee casts his or her vote at our National Board meeting. In order to secure our endorsement, the candidate needs the support of two-thirds of the State Lodges, a benchmark former President Trump easily cleared.\n\n\"During his first term, President Trump made it clear he supported law enforcement and border security,\u201d Yoes said. \u201cIn the summer of 2020, he stood with us when very few would. With his help, we defeated the \u2018defund the police\u2019 movement and, finally, we are seeing crime rates decrease. If we want to maintain these lower crime rates, we must re-elect Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nThough this election was highly unusual, the FOP considered the two 2024 presidential candidates' records\u2014including President Trump\u2019s responses to the FOP\u2019s questionnaire, as well as a letter from the Harris-Walz campaign describing some of their positions on criminal justice and police labor issues. An FOP committee met personally with former President Trump, but no similar meeting was granted by the Harris-Walz campaign. This information was provided to the more than 377,000 members of the FOP so they could make their own decision in this election.\n\n\u201cAs the nation\u2019s oldest and largest law enforcement labor organization, the FOP\u2019s presidential endorsement is one of the most sought-after endorsements by candidates running for the presidency,\u201d Yoes said. \u201cThe FOP is the number one voice of America\u2019s law enforcement. We have a responsibility to our members, to the 700,000 sworn law enforcement officers in the United States, and to the communities they serve to do our part in determining the direction in which our country will head.\u201d\n\nIn every election cycle, the FOP pays close attention to which presidential campaign highlights the issues most vital to the men and women of the FOP, including the challenges faced by the rank-and-file law enforcement officers, the real issues in public safety, and the problems in our criminal justice system. The FOP has endorsed candidates\u2014from both parties\u2014that our members believe have made the men and women of law enforcement a priority: George H. W. Bush (1992); William J. Clinton (1996); George W. Bush (2000, 2004); John S. McCain III (2008); Donald J. Trump (2016, 2020). In 2012, the FOP voted not to endorse a candidate.\n\n\u201cThe National FOP endorsed Donald Trump in 2016 and 2020. He led our nation through some very tough times,\u201d Yoes said. \u201cHe provided our nation with strong, effective leadership during his first term, and now that he is seeking election to a second term, we intend to help him win it.\u201d",

        "text": "What would you ask the presidential candidates?\nPresidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris held their first and, as yet, only scheduled debate on Sept. 10, and Americans were eager to hear their stances on a variety of issues.\n\nScholars at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, with expertise spanning cancer research, family dynamics, science funding and social movements, have questions for the candidates regarding issues they believe deserve more attention.\n\nFamily and Society\n\nWhat specific programs and policies will your administration champion to combat the public health issue of parental stress and mental health? \u2014 Darby Saxbe, Professor of Psychology; Founder Director of the USC Dornsife Center for the Changing Family\n\nThe United States Surgeon General just issued a public health advisory warning that parents are under significant stress, which can severely affect their mental health. Research has found that moms and dads now spend more time both working and caring for their children than parents did in the 1980s. Child care prices have risen more than 25% over the past 10 years.\n\nMany parents are performing dual caregiving roles; a quarter of U.S. adults live with a parent over 65 and a child under 18. Nearly 50% of moms and dads say their daily stress is completely overwhelming, compared to 26% of other adults.\n\nDarby Saxbe is a recognized expert on the biological and social processes that take place within the interpersonal context of the family. Her main lines of research include investigating the impact of family environments and family transitions on parents and exploring the impact of family environments on children.\n\nAs president, what will you do to re-engage major religious groups to build a more thoughtful and civil democratic public square in the United States? \u2014 Richard Wood, president of the USC Dornsife Institute for Advanced Catholic Studies\n\nSince the nation\u2019s founding, religion has contributed in considerable ways to American civic and democratic life. Many major social reform movements that changed policy, such as the abolition of slavery, the 1960s Civil Rights Movement, farmworker organizing of the 1970s, and pro-life campaigns have been rooted in religion. Lately, however, political discourse has become much more secularized. When religion is invoked, it\u2019s often narrowly partisan and sometimes uncivil.\n\nStill, religion remains a central consideration for many Americans. Nearly a quarter identify with a specific faith, and about half of those say their faith is highly important to them.\n\nRichard Wood\u2019s research and writing focus on religion, faith-based community organizing and global sociology. He is the author of two award-winning books, A Shared Future: Faith-Based Organizing for Racial Equity and Ethical Democracy and Faith in Action: Religion, Race, and Democratic Organizing in America.\n\nWhat policies will you enact as president to incentivize localities to build more housing? \u2014 Matthew Kahn, Provost Professor of Economics and Spatial Sciences\n\nEach fall, I teach undergraduate urban economics at USC Dornsife, focusing my lectures on the causes and consequences of high home prices in desirable states like California. My students understand that high demand combined with limited supply drives prices up. As a property owner in Los Angeles, I am delighted that home prices are high. As an educator, I am deeply concerned that my students will have limited access to achieving their own \u201cAmerican Dream.\u201d\n\nGiven that every locality, including places such as Berkeley and Santa Monica, has the right to determine its local land use regulations, I\u2019m curious how each of the administrations plan to influence these policies.\n\nMatthew Kahn is the author of 11 books on topics ranging from the economic effects of climate change to the new remote-work economy. With positions at the National Bureau of Economic Research and the USC Schaeffer Center for Health Policy & Economics, his research focuses on urban and environmental economics.\n\nWhat will you do to decrease polarized politics in our national government? \u2014 Paul Lichterman, Professor of Sociology and Religion\n\nAcross the political spectrum, Americans say it\u2019s distressing that our country is politically polarized, making it more difficult for Washington to make progress on issues that matter.\n\nIn the U.S., political scientists and sociologists find that political polarization has been increasing. They see a growing divide regarding the issues people consider most important, and note that Americans tune in to different news sources depending on their political affiliations.\n\nUnfortunately, this issue is less likely to be discussed directly by politicians than issues people vote on or stake their identities on.\n\nPaul Lichterman studies, among other topics, civic organizations and social movements, culture, religion and morality. His research asks how people work to address social problems in a socially unequal, culturally diverse society.\n\nScience and Health\n\nWhat are your plans to support fundamental, basic science research, particularly in physics and other physical sciences? \u2014 Vera Gluscevic, Associate Professor of Physics and Astronomy\n\nFor the past decade, the United States has focused on advancements in applied sciences and computation. However, the most crucial breakthroughs are ultimately based on a strong portfolio of fundamental research. Funding for fundamental research has not kept pace with developments in applied sciences in recent years, threatening to put the U.S. at a disadvantage in science, technology, engineering and other areas.\n\nVera Gluscevic is a cosmologist who combines theoretical astroparticle physics and astronomical data analysis to probe dark matter, dark energy and the processes that shaped the universe. Her research includes developing new ways to observe cosmic history in pursuit of understanding the fundamental fabric of nature.\n\nHow will you bring the country\u2019s investment in science aimed at producing better cancer outcomes to align with the private sector\u2019s investment in innovation, such as what a single social media company is putting into AI, currently 500% of the National Cancer Institute\u2019s budget? \u2014 Peter Kuhn, University Professor; Dean\u2019s Professor of Biological Sciences; Professor of Biological Sciences, Medicine, Biomedical Engineering, Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering and Urology\n\nDespite being a nation built on innovation, federal investment in science and our future has stalled, allowing global competitors to pass us by. Even some corporations invest more in research than the federal government. Meta, for example, invests $40 billion annually in AI \u2014 five times the National Cancer Institute\u2019s entire budget of $7 billion. Innovation in cancer care can produce better outcomes for all Americans, but this can only happen with stronger federal investment in research.\n\nPeter Kuhn is the founder and director of the Convergent Science Institute in Cancer, or CSI-Cancer. His research aims to advance personalized medicine and individualized patient care by translating clinical data into a mechanistic understanding of the physical and biological underpinnings of cancer dynamics.\n\nEnvironment and Sustainability\n\nIn addressing climate change, how will you minimize the near-term pains for Americans whose livelihoods depend upon the status quo? \u2014 Joe \u00c1rvai, Dana and David Dornsife Chair; Wrigley Institute Director; Professor of Psychology, Biological Sciences and Environmental Studies\n\nThe widely accepted strategies to address climate change will come with major near-term costs in exchange for long-term gain. The near-term pain will come in the form of very large capital expenditures, policies that are unpopular for many, and the displacement of many existing jobs. These near-term pains will eventually give way to long-term gains in economic and competitive strength, new job creation, and social and environmental benefits.\n\nWhile the pain will not be permanent, it will nevertheless be difficult to endure for those whose livelihoods are currently tied to the fossil fuel economy. I can\u2019t look my neighbors in the eye as a leader of a sustainability institute and call for an aggressive position in climate change without acknowledging how hard it\u2019s going to be for them and their families. We can\u2019t just cut our neighbors off at the knees.\n\nJoe \u00c1rvai is director of the USC Wrigley Institute for Environment and Sustainability, based at USC Dornsife. His research centers on people\u2019s critical thinking, judgment and decision-making capabilities, focusing on improving understanding of how people intuitively make judgments and decisions about, primarily, environmental issues and sustainability.\n\nHow do you plan to navigate discussions across states and with other countries to improve how we tackle plastic pollution? \u2014 Megan Fieser, Assistant Professor of Chemistry\n\nRight now, there is no nationwide rule or even statewide rule on how companies should recycle. This ultimately means that rules change from county to county and aren\u2019t often well-communicated for efficient and effective recycling. Additionally, there aren\u2019t ways I am aware of to tackle greenwashing, which harms the general public\u2019s perception of sustainable initiatives, as it is difficult to know what solutions are truly better. We need government to understand the complexity of the challenge, as the solutions are not going to be simple.\n\nMegan Fieser uses molecular inorganic chemistry to address both the production of plastics and the collection and recycling and upcycling of used plastics. Her research aims to develop catalysts both to help synthesize degradable polymers to replace petroleum-based plastics and to improve degradation of current commercial polymers.\n\nHow will you assure voters that your administration\u2019s energy policy won\u2019t sacrifice long-term environmental sustainability and the economic stability and overall well-being of American families in favor of short-term industry gains for fossil fuel companies? \u2014 Manuel Pastor, Director of the USC Dornsife Equity Research Institute; Distinguished Professor of Sociology and American Studies and Ethnicity; Turpanjian Chair in Civil Society and Social Change\n\nMy research has found that prioritizing fossil fuel profits harms vulnerable communities, worsens environmental damage and furthers economic inequality.\n\nI argue in my latest book that energy policy should not be shaped by short-term benefits for a few but should aim to build a resilient and equitable economy. Investing in clean, renewable energy can reduce negative impacts, create green jobs, such as solar technicians, and lower energy costs nationwide. Focusing on sustainable energy projects protects the environment while also boosting economic growth and ensuring that all Americans, especially the most vulnerable, share in the benefits.\n\nManuel Pastor\u2019s scholarship focuses on issues of the economic, environmental and social conditions facing low-income urban communities, and on the social movements surrounding those issues. He has served as a member of California\u2019s Governor\u2019s Task Force on Jobs and Business Recovery and Strategic Growth Council.\n\n9/11/2024: This story was updated to remove outdated wording.",

        "text": "US election 2024: How Kamala Harris and Donald Trump differ starkly on energy and climate\nOn 5 November, US voters will elect either Kamala Harris or Donald Trump as their next president.\n\nThe election, in a nation that is the largest oil producer and second largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the world, will be highly significant for climate politics both in the US and around the world.\n\nHarris, a Democrat who is currently serving as vice president under Joe Biden, is part of a government that has passed the most ambitious climate legislation in US history.\n\nUS fossil-fuel production has surged during the Biden administration. However, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has set the nation on a course to slash its domestic emissions by offering billions of dollars in subsidies and tax credits for clean energy and electric vehicles.\n\nTrump, the Republican candidate, is a climate sceptic who rolled back many environmental regulations during his 2017-2021 presidential term. He has dismissed climate policies as a \u201cscam\u201d, pulled the US out of the Paris Agreement and called for yet more oil production by repeating the mantra \u201cdrill, baby, drill\u201d.\n\nNeither candidate has yet released a detailed outline of their plans for US climate and energy policy.\n\nIn the interactive table below, Carbon Brief has assembled public statements from speeches, interviews and press conferences given in recent months.\n\nThe grid also includes comments made by their vice-presidential picks. For Harris, that is Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota, who has passed ambitious climate laws in his own state.\n\nTrump\u2019s running mate is Ohio senator JD Vance, a critic of the IRA who has leaned into climate scepticism in recent years as he has aligned himself with the former president.\n\nFinally, Carbon Brief has combed through the Democrat and Republican \u201cplatforms\u201d, which lay out the parties\u2019 priorities, to capture where they stand on key issues. (As various outlets have reported, the Republican platform is based heavily on Trump\u2019s ideas, with many passages paraphrased or lifted directly from his speeches and social media posts.)\n\nEach entry in the grid represents a direct quote from these documents and sources. In some cases, quotes have been taken from campaign spokespeople representing candidates.\n\nClimate contrast\n\nThe two parties and their presidential candidates have completely divergent views on climate change.\n\nBoth Trump and Vance have repeatedly voiced doubts about whether climate change is a threat, whether it is caused by humans or whether it even exists. The Republican platform does not mention climate change at all.\n\nCampaign officials and advisors to Trump have reportedly been clear that they would roll back much of the regulation and spending associated with the IRA if the former president is elected.\n\nProject 2025, a \u201cblueprint\u201d for the presidency assembled by the Heritage Foundation and other conservative groups, lays out plans to dismantle climate regulations and shrink or disband key climate-related agencies. While Trump has distanced himself from this plan, it has widely been viewed as a \u201cplaybook\u201d for his second administration. (The grid above does not include any Project 2025 statements.)\n\nIn public, rather than referencing the IRA by name,Trump and Republicans have generally referred to \u201cterminating\u201d the \u201csocialist green new deal\u201d \u2013 or \u201cgreen new scam\u201d, as Trump describes it. Trump has framed climate policies generally as a waste of taxpayers\u2019 money.\n\n(This references the green new deal \u2013 a proposed set of policies by progressive Democrats that has never made it into legislation. It was, however, supported by Harris when she was a senator.)\n\nMeanwhile, Harris oversaw the passing of the IRA, even casting the tie-breaking vote for it in Congress as vice president. She has called climate change an \u201cexistential threat\u201d and has a history of prosecuting oil companies for environmental violations while she was California attorney general.\n\nNevertheless, many news outlets have noted that, unlike Biden, Harris has barely mentioned climate change since taking over as the Democratic nominee in August. (Some of the statements in the grid above were made in the months prior to her nomination.)\n\nThe only reference to climate in her Democratic Convention speech came when she described the ability to \u201clive free from the pollution that fuels the climate crisis\u201d as a \u201cfundamental freedom\u201d threatened by Trump. Similar language has been used by Walz.\n\nDespite the general lack of detail on climate and energy policies so far, Harris\u2019 campaign team has stated she intends to continue the policies implemented under the Biden administration. Climate advocates have voiced their support for her and Walz, citing their strong backgrounds in climate policy.\n\nBeyond Harris, the Democratic platform includes a more detailed set of policy priorities, sticking to the ones set out under the Biden administration.\n\n\u2019Drill, baby, drill\u2019\n\nTrump\u2019s rhetoric has been light on detailed policy plans. However, one point that he has repeatedly returned to is the idea that drilling for more fossil fuels will bring financial benefits for Americans.\n\nHe has told many crowds and interviewers that \u201cwe will drill, baby, drill\u201d \u2013 employing a well-worn Republican slogan. By tapping into the \u201cliquid gold under our feet\u201d, he says he will be able to bring down inflation and cut people\u2019s energy bills.\n\nUnder Biden, the US is already the largest producer of oil in the world. Perhaps seeking to make a clear distinction between himself and his predecessor, Trump says the US will become not just \u201cenergy independent\u201d, but \u201cenergy dominant\u201d.\n\nIn doing this, Trump has pledged to cut energy and electricity prices \u201cby at least half within a 12-month period\u201d. He says US energy supplies will be massively boosted, primarily with gas, which he incorrectly describes as \u201cclean\u201d.\n\nVance has also voiced support for fossil fuels, taking aim in the past at Biden\u2019s \u201cwanton harassment of fossil fuel companies\u201d and his \u201cwar on traditional American energy\u201d.\n\nBoth Republicans have reportedly received large sums of money from the fossil-fuel industry to support their political campaigns over the years.\n\nAs for Harris, some have speculated that she could \u201ctake on\u201d the fossil-fuel industry, drawing on her experience as a prosecutor. However, so far one of her only definitive, energy-related statements as a presidential candidate has been to support fracking.\n\nHarris said she would ban fracking when she ran for her party\u2019s presidential nomination in 2020. However, under fire from right-wing groups and Trump himself over her historic stance and its implications for jobs in the swing state of Pennsylvania, Harris assured the press she did not oppose fracking.\n\nElectric cars\n\nAnother key divergence between Democrats and Republicans is over electric cars.\n\nThe Biden administration\u2019s IRA contains tax credits and other measures to encourage the sale of electric cars in the US, as well as support the nation\u2019s domestic car manufacturers.\n\nIt has also overseen the most stringent pollution standards for road vehicles. This measure increasingly limits collective vehicle emissions over time, meaning that more than half of the cars sold in the US by 2032 would need to be electric to meet the restrictions.\n\nThis regulation is not a mandate and does not include a future ban on the sale of petrol and diesel cars, as some other nations have done. Nevertheless, the Republican platform and Trump himself have referred to it as such, vowing to scrap it when in power.\n\nTrump told attendees at the Republican National Convention in July that, in doing so, he would \u201csav[e] the US auto industry from complete obliteration\u201d.\n\nTrump, Vance and the Republicans in general have voiced concerns about China\u2019s dominance in the electric vehicle industry. At the same time, Trump has suggested he may cut tax credits for electric vehicles \u2013 which are designed to encourage people to buy cars manufactured in North America \u2013 in a move that could benefit Chinese companies.\n\nYet Trump has a complicated relationship with electric cars, in part because of his apparent fondness for Tesla chief executive Elon Musk. The former president told Bloomberg: \u201cI have no objection to the electric vehicle\u2026I think it\u2019s great. Elon is fantastic.\u201d\n\nHowever, Trump added that \u201cyou can\u2019t have 100% of your cars electric\u2026The cars don\u2019t go far enough. They\u2019re very, very expensive. They\u2019re also heavy\u201d.\n\nRight-leaning news outlets have stated that Harris has backtracked in her historic support for electric vehicle mandates.\n\nThey quote a \u201cfactcheck\u201d email sent out by the Harris campaign team, which was intended to preemptively respond to Vance visiting the car-producing state of Michigan. There, Harris\u2019 team said the Republican would \u201cundoubtedly lie\u201d about her stance on electric vehicles.\n\nThe email stated that the Democratic candidate \u201cdoes not support an electric vehicle mandate\u201d, but does back the IRA which includes \u201cground-breaking subsidies and tax credits for electric vehicles\u201d.",

        "text": "What the Outcome of the Election Could Mean for Medicaid\nWhile Medicaid policy may not be a central issue candidates are talking about, the outcome of the election could have major implications for Medicaid, the primary program providing comprehensive coverage for over one in five low-income Americans. Medicaid is jointly financed by the federal government and states and administered by states within broad federal guidelines. Medicaid represents nearly one in five dollars spent on health and disproportionately finances safety-net hospitals and clinics, behavioral health care, and long-term services and supports (LTSS) in the community and nursing homes for seniors and people with disabilities. Medicaid has become a major part of our health care system, with two-thirds of Americans having a connection to Medicaid. Public opinion polling shows Medicaid has broad support across political parties.\n\nThis brief highlights major policy differences under the Biden-Harris Administration and the Trump Administration on key Medicaid topic areas. The brief examines the records and proposed budgets under President Biden and Vice President Harris and former President Trump as well as major legislative proposals that former President Trump supported. Budget proposals often include policy proposals that would require Congressional action to enact. The 2024 Republican Party platform calls for new affordable health care and prescription drug options with protections for Medicare and seniors but does not include any details about Medicaid policy. To help inform the range of options that could be considered under a Trump presidency, this brief also examines Medicaid policies included in the Republican Study Committee (RSC) FY 2025 budget and the Heritage Foundation\u2019s Project 2025. Former President Trump has not endorsed these proposals, though there would likely be a push for them from conservative groups and Republicans in Congress if Trump wins the election. Policy differences are highlighted across the following key Medicaid topic areas, with more detail about candidate records and specific sources in the Appendix.\n\nThe analysis finds that Vice President Harris and former President Trump have vastly different records, views on, and policy proposals for Medicaid (Figure 1). More broadly, as KFF President and CEO Drew Altman recently wrote, \u201cRepublicans and Democrats have fundamentally different world views of the program.\u201d\n\nBiden-Harris Administration policy proposals have generally focused on efforts to \u201cprotect and strengthen Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act (ACA)\u201d by expanding health coverage and improving continuity of coverage, reducing the rate and number of uninsured, expanding access to care, and reducing health disparities. These policies generally maintain or increase federal Medicaid spending.\n\nFormer President Trump has not talked specifically about Medicaid in the current campaign, but his record as president and proposals from Republican groups include plans to repeal or weaken the ACA, cap and reduce Medicaid financing, and restrict Medicaid eligibility, with the overarching goal of reducing federal spending on Medicaid. Estimates of savings range widely, from a $4.5 trillion reduction over 10 years (over a 50% reduction) under the RSC FY 2025 budget proposal, to earlier Congressional Republican proposals that would have reduced Medicaid spending by 25% or one-third, to other proposals with smaller overall reductions but large shifts in spending across states. Reductions in federal spending generally shift risk and costs to states as well as enrollees and would likely increase the number of uninsured people.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nVice President Harris inherits the record of the current administration but has also independently focused on reproductive rights and policies aimed at reducing maternal mortality and morbidity. Major Biden-Harris Administration efforts across key Medicaid topic areas include:\n\nACA Medicaid Expansion : The Biden-Harris Administration implemented policies to strengthen the ACA, including enacting legislation with an additional fiscal incentive for states to adopt Medicaid expansion. The administration also proposed a plan to close the coverage gap in states that have not expanded Medicaid, but it did not pass Congress.\n\n: The Biden-Harris Administration implemented policies to strengthen the ACA, including enacting legislation with an additional fiscal incentive for states to adopt Medicaid expansion.

Eligibility, Benefits, and Cost-Sharing : The Biden-Harris Administration enacted legislation to expand access to health insurance coverage by requiring 12-month continuous eligibility for children and creating an option for states to extend postpartum coverage to 12 months as well as cover certain justice-involved youth. During the unwinding of the Medicaid continuous enrollment provision, the administration issued guidance and provided states with additional waiver flexibilities to help eligible enrollees retain coverage.\n\n: The Biden-Harris Administration enacted legislation to expand access to health insurance coverage by requiring 12-month continuous eligibility for children and creating an option for states to extend postpartum coverage to 12 months as well as cover certain justice-involved youth.

Prescription Drugs : The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), enacted during the Biden-Harris Administration, included several provisions to lower prescription drug costs and reduce drug spending by the federal government, including allowing the federal government to negotiate prices for some drugs in Medicare and requiring that drug manufacturers pay rebates for price increases above inflation in Medicare.

Managed Care: The Biden-Harris Administration issued updated Medicaid managed care regulations aimed at improving access to care, quality, health outcomes, and health equity as well as took action to improve Medicaid managed care monitoring, oversight, and transparency.\n\nSpecific Republican policies, both during and after the Trump Administration, across key Medicaid topic areas include:\n\nACA Medicaid Expansion : The Trump Administration proposed and supported unsuccessful efforts to repeal and replace the ACA, including Medicaid expansion. More recent Republican proposals, the RSC FY 2025 budget and Project 2025, do not specify a complete repeal but seek to reduce the higher match rate for the Medicaid expansion group and eliminate expanded Marketplace subsidies.\n\n: The Trump Administration proposed and supported unsuccessful efforts to repeal and replace the ACA, including Medicaid expansion.

As of summer 2024, 41 states including DC have expanded Medicaid while 10 states have not, leaving 1.5 million uninsured people in the \u201ccoverage gap\u201d (adults who have incomes above their state\u2019s eligibility for Medicaid but below poverty, making them ineligible for subsidies in the ACA Marketplaces). The ACA expansion group is financed with a 90% federal match rate or \u201cFMAP\u201d, so states pay 10% of the costs for the expansion group. Data from June 2023 show almost 24 million adults were enrolled in Medicaid through the ACA expansion eligibility pathway. Total spending for this population in fiscal year 2022 was over $155 billion, including $138 billion in federal spending and $17 billion in state spending. The ACA also created health insurance exchange markets, or Marketplaces, which offer subsidized coverage to those who are not eligible for Medicaid and who do not have access to other affordable coverage.\n\nBiden-Harris: The Biden-Harris Administration enacted legislation to strengthen the ACA, including an additional fiscal incentive for states to adopt the ACA Medicaid expansion and temporary enhanced subsidies for Marketplace coverage. The Biden-Harris Administration has also taken action to increase funding for Marketplace outreach and navigators and has supported legislation to close the coverage gap (that never passed). Four new states have adopted Medicaid expansion since Biden and Vice President Harris took office, and the number of people with Marketplace coverage has grown significantly under the administration. The Biden-Harris Administration\u2019s latest budget builds on these actions by proposing to make the enhanced Marketplace subsidies permanent and continuing to call for closing the coverage gap. As a part of a recent campaign speech focused on economic issues in North Carolina, Vice President Harris also highlighted health proposals including extending the enhanced Marketplace subsidies.\n\nTrump and Republican Proposals: Former President Trump modeled proposals included in his 2019 and 2020 budgets on the Graham-Cassidy amendment, which called for repealing and replacing the ACA (the FY 2021 budget was more vague about health reform proposals). Other legislation introduced but not enacted during the Trump presidency \u2014 the American Health Care Act (AHCA) and the Better Care Reconciliation Act (BCRA) \u2014 also called for repealing and replacing the ACA. More recently released Republican proposals do not specify a complete repeal of the ACA, but the RSC FY 2025 budget proposes to eliminate the expanded ACA subsidies and reduce the FMAP for the Medicaid expansion group. Project 2025 also proposes \u201ca fairer and more rational match rate\u201d for the Medicaid expansion group.\n\nTradeoffs: The Biden-Harris Administration proposals would support expanded coverage but increase federal spending. Republican proposals would eliminate or severely limit access to affordable health insurance coverage for low-income adults but would reduce federal spending. Rolling back the ACA Medicaid expansion could also have implications for state fiscal conditions and providers. The federal government pays the vast majority of expansion costs, and the literature shows that states expanding Medicaid under the ACA have realized budget savings, revenue gains, overall economic growth as well as observed positive effects on the finances of hospitals and other health care providers. Recent KFF polling finds that more than three in four (78%) enrollees and two-thirds of all adults in a non-expansion state say their state should expand Medicaid to cover more low-income uninsured people. Among the public overall, expanding Medicaid is largely split along partisan lines.\n\n(Back to top)\n\nFinancing\n\nContext: Medicaid is an entitlement program, meaning individuals who meet eligibility requirements are guaranteed coverage and states are guaranteed federal matching funds without a cap for qualified services provided to eligible enrollees. The FMAP (federal match rate) for most Medicaid enrollees is determined by a formula in the law that provides a match of at least 50% and provides a higher federal match rate for states with lower per capita incomes. There are also higher match rates for certain services and populations like the ACA expansion group (90%). Medicaid also provides \u201cdisproportionate share hospital\u201d (DSH) payments to hospitals that serve a large number of Medicaid and low-income uninsured patients to offset uncompensated care costs. Medicaid represents almost $1 out of every $5 spent on health care in the U.S. and provides significant financing for hospitals, community health centers, physicians, nursing homes, and community-based LTSS.\n\nFor state budgets, Medicaid is a spending item and at the same time the largest source of federal revenues. To help finance the state share of Medicaid, states can use funding from local governments or revenue collected from provider taxes and fees to help finance the state share of Medicaid within certain limits and rules.\n\nBiden-Harris: The Biden-Harris Administration has built on the existing financing framework by expanding federal matching funds for priority areas, such as incentivizing states to expand Medicaid or Medicaid home and community-based services. The administration\u2019s latest budget proposal (along with prior budgets) keeps the Medicaid financing system as is under federal law and also provides funding to improve program integrity and prevent fraud.\n\nTrump and Republican Proposals: The Trump Administration and other Republican proposals examined aim to significantly limit federal Medicaid spending by restructuring Medicaid financing into a block grant or a per capita cap where states would receive a pre-set amount of funding for Medicaid in total or per enrollee. Typically, a base year of Medicaid spending would be established and then the aggregate or per enrollee caps would increase by a specified amount each year, typically tied to inflation or inflation plus some percentage. To generate federal savings, the total amount of federal spending would be less than what is expected under current law. Program costs in excess of the total or per enrollee caps would not be matched by the federal government, leaving states to cover these costs or reduce Medicaid spending. Proposals that cap federal Medicaid funding could also eliminate the entitlement to coverage or federal minimum requirements for eligibility and benefits. The Trump Administration FY 2020 budget proposed to convert federal Medicaid funding to a per capita allotment; this change along with other health care adjustments totaled $1 trillion in spending reductions relative to estimated spending under current law over 10 years. More recent Republican proposals, the RSC FY 2025 budget and Project 2025, call for capped Medicaid spending as well as a match rate of 50% for all eligibility groups and services (RSC FY 2025 budget) or a \u201cblended\u201d match rate (Project 2025).\n\nProposals that fundamentally change the financing structure and entitlement nature of the program would require legislative change and would have broad implications across all areas of Medicaid; however, even without legislative changes, presidential administrations have options to issue regulations or guidance as well as approve demonstration waivers which could result in incremental program changes. In lieu of major legislative changes to Medicaid financing, former President Trump also issued guidance and encouraged states to apply for Healthy Adult Opportunity waivers that offered states \u201cextensive flexibility\u201d to cover certain groups of enrollees in exchange for limits in federal financing and access to shared savings for spending below the set cap; however, no states were approved for such waivers. In addition to restructuring Medicaid financing, Republican proposals also include provisions to restrict the use of provider taxes, combat Medicaid improper payments, and improve program integrity.\n\nTradeoffs: Republican proposals would substantially reduce federal Medicaid spending and allow states additional flexibility to administer their programs. KFF analysis has found that Medicaid financing caps would also limit the ability of states to meet changing needs and demands (e.g. changing state demographics, emerging high-cost drugs, etc.), and could lock-in current state spending patterns that reflect historic Medicaid policy choices. States would likely have to make choices to cover fewer people, cut benefits, and/or lower payment rates for providers (though Medicaid is typically already the lowest payer), leaving more people uninsured and reliant on safety net providers or unable to access care. While states may gain additional flexibility to administer their programs, these new options are not likely to make up for significant cuts in federal spending. States would likely face challenges to maintaining coverage, with certain states (like those with higher health care costs or needs) more at risk. Proposed changes to the FMAP floor or the ACA match rate could reduce federal spending but have disparate effects on states. States with higher per capita incomes could be most affected by calls to lower the FMAP floor while states with lower per capita incomes could be most affected by proposals to have a uniform match rate of 50%. Across many Republican proposals, expansion states would fare worse than non-expansion states with proposals to reduce the expansion match.\n\nRecent KFF polling found that nearly 9 in 10 (86%) Medicaid enrollees want Medicaid to largely continue as it is today, while one in ten (14%) support changing Medicaid to cap federal funding and give states greater flexibility in designing their programs. Somewhat fewer adults overall \u2013 though notably still a large majority \u2013 say the same (86% vs. 71%). KFF polling has also found that majorities of voters are worried about fraud, waste, and abuse in Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security as well as in private health insurance plans. Both parties support reducing waste, fraud, and abuse and focusing on oversight of managed care plans and providers; however, there was more of a focus on reducing errors in eligibility determinations during the Trump presidency compared to a focus on oversight of providers and managed care plans during the Biden-Harris Administration.\n\n(Back to top)\n\nEligibility, Benefits, and Cost-Sharing\n\nContext: Medicaid provides financing for a variety of groups and for a wide range of services. To participate in Medicaid and receive federal matching funds, states must meet minimum federal requirements related to who is eligible and what services must be covered. States must provide certain mandatory benefits (e.g., hospital, physician, and nursing home services) to mandatory populations (e.g., children and low-income pregnant people) without waiting lists or enrollment caps. States may also receive federal matching funds to cover \u201coptional\u201d services (e.g., adult dental care and home and community-based services ) or \u201coptional\u201d groups (e.g., children and pregnant people with income above the limits established for mandatory populations). States do have the flexibility to charge premiums and cost-sharing for some enrollees, though federal law limits the extent to which states can impose these measures.\n\nSection 1115 Medicaid demonstration waivers offer states an avenue to test new approaches in Medicaid that differ from what is required by federal statute. While there is great variation in how states have used waivers over time, waivers generally reflect priorities identified by states and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). States may obtain \u201ccomprehensive\u201d Section 1115 waivers that make broad changes in Medicaid eligibility, benefits, provider payments, and other program rules; other waivers may be narrower and address specific populations or benefits.\n\nBiden-Harris: The Biden-Harris Administration enacted the 2023 Consolidated Appropriations Act, which required states to implement 12-month continuous eligibility for children, made permanent the option for states to extend postpartum coverage to 12 months, and provided states with the option to cover certain justice-involved youth. Vice President Harris has called for reducing maternal mortality and morbidity, including encouraging states to adopt the postpartum Medicaid coverage extension. The Biden-Harris Administration also finalized a rule that aligns and streamlines enrollment and renewal requirements for most individuals in Medicaid; creates timeliness requirements for redeterminations of eligibility; eliminates access barriers for children enrolled in CHIP, such as waiting periods; and facilitates transitions between Medicaid, CHIP, and Marketplace coverage. During the unwinding of the Medicaid continuous enrollment provision, the administration issued guidance and identified a range of strategies and waiver flexibilities states could adopt to limit coverage losses among those who remained eligible.\n\nFor the 2025 budget year, the Biden-Harris Administration proposes to require 12 months of postpartum Medicaid coverage, expand state options to provide continuous eligibility for children for multiple years, and eliminate fees and premiums in separate CHIP programs. Further, the Biden-Harris Administration continues to encourage waivers to expand coverage, reduce health disparities, address the social determinants of health, and help individuals transition out of incarceration.\n\nTrump and Republican Proposals: Consistent with the Trump Administration and older legislative proposals, recent Republican proposals would make a number of changes that limit Medicaid eligibility, benefits, and continuity of coverage as well as impose work requirements for enrollees. More specifically, both the RSC FY 2025 budget and Project 2025 propose work requirements, making changes to eligibility thresholds (like eliminating minimum income eligibility for children), establishing flexible accounts (like health savings accounts) to pay for health care, and providing state flexibility to redesign and eliminate certain benefits. Project 2025 also proposes targeted time limits or lifetime caps on benefits, requiring more frequent eligibility redeterminations, and increasing premiums and cost-sharing for some individuals. Capping federal funding, as all Republican proposals examined support, would also have implications for the entitlement (guarantee of coverage for eligible individuals that is part of current law) though none of the proposals clearly note what would become of the entitlement or minimum eligibility thresholds. Section 1115 waiver priorities promoted and approved under former President Trump included eligibility restrictions such as work and premium requirements and other conditions on coverage that did not require legislative changes to advance.\n\nTradeoffs: The Biden-Harris Administration proposals would expand access to coverage as well as keep more individuals connected to care over time but could increase spending. Continuous eligibility policies, which have been embraced by the Biden-Harris Administration, have been shown to lower rates of \u201cchurn,\u201d or the temporary loss of Medicaid coverage in which enrollees disenroll and then re-enroll within a short period of time. When individuals churn on and off coverage, they experience gaps in coverage that can limit access to care and lead to delays in getting needed care. The Biden-Harris Administration proposals would also likely increase enrollment among eligible children by eliminating CHIP premiums and enrollment fees, which can pose barriers to coverage.\n\nIn contrast, Republican proposals support more frequent and robust eligibility redetermination processes to ensure that only eligible individuals remain enrolled in the program. However, with more frequent data checks, eligible individuals are at risk for losing coverage if they do not receive or understand notices or forms requesting additional information to verify eligibility or do not respond to requests within required timeframes. Some enrollees, such as working individuals whose monthly income fluctuates, would be at a higher risk of churning on and off Medicaid than others. In addition, most Republican proposals include work requirements. The data show that the majority of Medicaid enrollees are already working, and available implementation data suggests that Medicaid work and reporting requirements are confusing to enrollees and result in substantial coverage loss among eligible individuals who experience challenges with reporting requirements. Republican proposals also provide states additional flexibility by reducing requirements to cover certain benefits and allowing more premiums and cost-sharing. Overall, Republican proposals describe these changes as aligning Medicaid with private insurance, and they would likely reduce federal Medicaid spending. Because people on Medicaid have lower incomes and are sicker than the general population, these changes are also likely to pose barriers to enrollees\u2019 ability to maintain coverage and access needed health care.\n\n(Back to top)\n\nPrescription Drugs\n\nContext: All state Medicaid programs have opted to cover prescription drug benefits, and states have flexibility in how they administer the Medicaid pharmacy benefit within federal guidelines about pricing and rebates. Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program (MDRP), a manufacturer must enter into a rebate agreement with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, agreeing to rebate a specified portion of the Medicaid payment for the drug to the states and the federal government. In exchange, Medicaid programs cover nearly all of the manufacturer\u2019s FDA-approved drugs, and the drugs are eligible for federal matching funds.\n\nBiden-Harris: The Biden-Harris Administration enacted the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022, a major piece of legislation with a number of prescription drug provisions aimed at reducing federal drug spending, including allowing the federal government to negotiate prices for some drugs in Medicare and requiring that drug manufacturers pay rebates for price increases above inflation in Medicare. The latest proposed budget outlines steps to build on the IRA, including expanding the Medicare drug negotiation program. The administration also approved Florida\u2019s plan to import some prescription drugs from Canada, though implementation is contingent on further action by Florida. Within Medicaid, the Biden-Harris Administration has taken action to strengthen the MDRP by lifting the rebate cap, and their latest budget proposal includes provisions to expand the MDRP and allow the federal government to negotiate for supplemental rebates on behalf of state Medicaid programs, though these provisions have not passed. The Biden-Harris Administration also issued a proposed rule (yet to be finalized) aimed at increasing price transparency and established a voluntary model to increase access to cell and gene therapies for people with Medicaid.\n\nTrump and Republican Proposals: The Trump Administration encouraged states to submit waivers allowing states to create closed formularies, enabling Medicaid programs to negotiate directly with manufacturers for drug coverage (under current law, the MDRP creates an open formulary). The Trump Administration also created a new pathway to allow states to import prescription drugs from Canada, finalized a rule allowing manufacturers to report multiple best prices under value-based purchasing agreements with the goal of increasing value-based arrangements in the MDRP, and proposed lifting the rebate cap (this was later lifted by Biden-Harris Administration legislation). Both the RSC FY 2025 budget and Project 2025 seek to repeal the IRA, citing its impact on innovation and patient access, and Project 2025 proposes to address drug shortages by eliminating manufacturer rebate payments for multi-source generic drugs. Further, broader Republican proposals to cut and cap federal Medicaid spending could have implications for prescription drug coverage, as it is an optional benefit.\n\nTradeoffs: Recent Republican proposals take aim at the IRA while the Biden-Harris Administration plans to continue strengthening the IRA. KFF polling has found most voters are supportive of the Biden-Harris Administration proposals that build on the IRA. While the IRA is expected to lower prescription drug costs for people with Medicare and reduce drug spending by the federal government, the provisions do interact with the MDRP and could increase overall Medicaid prescription drug spending. Both administrations have taken action on drug importation, but, while the idea of importing prescription drugs has bipartisan support among the general public, there are long-standing concerns in terms of ensuring drug safety. The approach is also opposed by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) and the Canadian government and resulting savings estimates are unclear.\n\nThe Trump and Biden-Harris Administration records on the MDRP have diverged, with the Biden-Harris Administration working to strengthen the MDRP while the Trump Administration proposed allowing states to opt out of the program. While opting out of the MDRP could allow states to have more leverage when negotiating (because they could decide not to cover certain drugs completely), it is not clear that a closed formulary would result in savings, and closed formularies can restrict access to drugs for enrollees. Further, recent Republican proposals to address drug shortages and the late-era Trump Administration rule allowing multiple best price reporting could potentially weaken the MDRP and reduce the rebates states and the federal government receive from manufacturers. According to a Congressional Budget Office (CBO) study, rebates in the MDRP result in lower net drug prices in Medicaid compared with other federal programs.\n\n(Back to top)\n\nLong-Term Services and Supports (LTSS)\n\nContext: LTSS encompass the broad range of paid and unpaid medical and personal care services that assist with the activities of daily living such as eating and bathing and the instrumental activities of daily living such as preparing meals and managing medication. They are provided to people who need such services because of aging, chronic illness, or disability and may be provided in institutional settings such as nursing facilities or in people\u2019s homes and the community. Services provided in non-institutional settings are known as home and community-based services (HCBS), and those settings may include a person\u2019s home, adult day care centers, assisted living settings, and group homes. Medicaid is the primary payer for LTSS, providing services to an estimated 1.4 million enrollees in nursing facilities and 4.5 million enrollees in HCBS settings.\n\nFederal Medicaid statutes require states to cover nursing facility care and home health, but coverage of other LTSS is optional. Most HCBS are provided through \u201cwaivers,\u201d which allow states to offer a wide range of benefits and to choose\u2014and limit\u2014the number of people who receive such services. Unlike other Medicaid services, many states use waiting lists when the number of people seeking services exceeds the number of waiver slots available. An estimated 0.7 million people have been on HCBS waiting lists in most years between 2016 and 2023. Medicaid has historically spent more money on LTSS in institutional settings than on LTSS delivered in home and community-based settings, but over the past decade, Medicaid has spent more on HCBS than institutional care due to states\u2019 community integration obligations under the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Supreme Court\u2019s Olmstead decision. In Olmstead, the Supreme Court held that the unjustified institutionalization of people with disabilities is illegal discrimination and violates the Americans with Disabilities Act. A major challenge for Medicaid HCBS is finding enough workers, with employment levels in elderly care and nursing care facilities remaining below their pre-pandemic levels.\n\nBiden-Harris: The Biden-Harris Administration increased federal financing for and oversight over Medicaid LTSS through increased funding, new legislative proposals, and rulemaking. The Administration enacted ARPA during the pandemic, which included a provision that temporarily increased the federal match rate for spending on Medicaid HCBS by 10 percentage points to expand access to HCBS and support direct care workers. The Biden-Harris Administration also issued legislative proposals calling for more permanent and extensive federal investments in Medicaid HCBS. The Biden-Harris Administration\u2019s FY 2025 budget proposes further HCBS investment, requires the reporting of HCBS quality measures, and includes actions to further increase oversight of nursing facilities. The Administration also finalized several regulatory changes that would bolster Medicaid LTSS:\n\nSeveral rules aimed at combatting discrimination on the basis of disability, which may provide people with disabilities greater autonomy and independence while they receive Medicaid LTSS;\n\nRequirements for states to provide access to Medicaid HCBS, which includes ensuring payment rates are sufficient to support a workforce, reporting requirements related to waiting lists and other quality measures, and ensuring that 80% of Medicaid payments for certain HCBS are spent on compensation for direct care workers; and\n\nEstablishment of the first ever requirements for minimum staffing levels in nursing facilities with increased transparency around the percent of Medicaid payments for institutional LTSS that are spent on workforce compensation and private equity ownership of nursing facilities.\n\nTrump and Republican Proposals: The Trump Administration budgets and other Republican proposals do not include specific changes to Medicaid LTSS, but past policies and current proposals hint that services for older adults may be favored over people with disabilities who are under age 65. The Trump Administration\u2019s regulatory actions generally resulted in less federal oversight over LTSS. The Trump Administration took actions to reduce federal oversight of Medicaid LTSS, including issuing a proposed rule that would have reduced federal requirements for nursing facilities (but was never finalized), suspending routine inspections in nursing facilities during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, and delaying requirements for states to comply with federal rules surrounding HCBS (the \u201cHCBS Settings rule).\u201d When COVID-19 vaccines became available, the Trump Administration launched the Pharmacy Partnership for Long-Term Care Program to facilitate COVID-19 vaccinations in facilities where residents are ages 65 and older, though these initial federal vaccine programs did not cover settings that primarily serve people with disabilities under ages 65. Similarly, the 2024 Republican Party platform seeks to expand in-home care for older adults, but does not propose similar expansions for those with disabilities under age 65. It describes \u201cshifting resources,\u201d to support new policies to help seniors remain in their homes but does not specific what programs might be cut to free up such resources. Project 2025 includes language that would allow states \u201cflexibility to redesign eligibility, financing, and service delivery of long-term care to serve the most vulnerable and truly needy and eliminate middle-income to upper-income Medicaid recipients,\u201d which could include eliminating some of the optional Medicaid eligibility pathways that offer coverage to higher-income people who LTSS. Proposals that fundamentally change the financing structure of Medicaid such as cutting or capping federal spending would likely result in restrictions to LTSS.\n\nTradeoffs: The Biden-Harris Administration Medicaid LTSS policies could expand access to services and increase federal oversight of the quality of services provided but could increase spending on LTSS and reduce states\u2019 flexibility in administering the Medicaid LTSS benefits. The Biden-Harris Administration has consistently called for legislative changes to provide additional funding for Medicaid LTSS (HCBS in particular).\n\nIn contrast, it is difficult to anticipate what specific proposals would emerge under a Trump Administration. The Trump Administration\u2019s actions coupled with Republican proposals to eliminate the new nursing facility staffing standards and prohibit the requirement that 80% of Medicaid payments for certain HCBS are spent on compensation for direct care workers suggest that there would be less federal oversight of access to and quality of care, but more flexibility for states in providing Medicaid LTSS. Republican proposals support policies focusing on long-term care and helping seniors to remain in their homes but do not mention a role for Medicaid or home care for people under age 65, and nearly two thirds of people who use Medicaid HCBS are under age 65.\n\n(Back to top)\n\nManaged Care\n\nContext: States design and administer their own Medicaid programs within federal rules and determine how they will deliver and pay for care for Medicaid enrollees. Managed care is the dominant delivery system for Medicaid enrollees, with almost three-quarters of Medicaid beneficiaries enrolled in comprehensive managed care organizations (MCOs), accounting for about 52% of total Medicaid spending (or more than $415 billion) in FY 2022. State managed care contracts vary widely, in the populations required to enroll, the services covered (or \u201ccarved in\u201d), and the quality and performance incentives and penalties employed. While there are federal and state requirements for managed care plans, plans have flexibility in certain areas, including in setting provider payment rates.\n\nManaged care plans are at financial risk for the services covered under their contracts and receive a per member per month \u201ccapitation\u201d payment for these services. To limit the amount that plans can spend on administration and keep as profit, CMS requires states to develop capitation rates for Medicaid to achieve a medical loss ratio (MLR) of at least 85%. The MLR reflects the proportion of total capitation payments received by an MCO spent on clinical services and quality improvement, where the remainder goes to administrative costs and profit. While there is no federal requirement for Medicaid plans to pay remittances to the state if they fail to meet the MLR standard, states have discretion to require remittances.\n\nBiden-Harris: The Biden-Harris Administration released final Medicaid managed care regulations in 2024 aimed at improving access to care, quality, health outcomes, and health equity. The new rules establish national maximum wait time standards for certain appointments and a requirement for states to conduct independent secret shopper surveys to validate MCO compliance with wait time standards. The Biden-Harris Administration also finalized rules related to plan prior authorizations focused on streamlining process, reducing approval wait times, and improving transparency. The Biden-Harris Administration has taken action to improve Medicaid managed care monitoring, oversight, and transparency, releasing reporting templates and toolkits for states and publicly posting state managed care annual reports.\n\nThe Biden-Harris Administration enacted the 2024 Consolidated Appropriations Act, which included a financial incentive to encourage certain states to collect remittances from Medicaid MCOs that do not meet minimum MLR requirements. The Biden-Harris Administration\u2019s FY 2024 and 2025 budgets went further proposing to require Medicaid managed care plans to meet an 85% minimum MLR and to require states to collect remittances if plans fail to meet the minimum MLR. The most recent budget also included provisions aimed at strengthening CMS\u2019s Medicaid managed care financial oversight and compliance tools.\n\nTrump and Republican Proposals: During his presidency, Trump took administrative action to change Medicaid managed care rules, including relaxing rules around network adequacy and beneficiary protections. Trump\u2019s FY 2020 budget proposed changes to the Medicaid managed care waiver process (e.g., to lengthen the duration of certain managed care waivers) aimed at reducing administrative burden. Project 2025 notes the intent to reform and increase oversight of Medicaid managed care but doesn\u2019t provide specifics. Proposals that fundamentally change the financing structure of Medicaid would likely also have implications for the delivery of care in Medicaid, impacting managed care plans.\n\nTradeoffs: Recent Democratic administrations have made sweeping changes to Medicaid managed care rules and regulations to advance program goals related to access to care, quality, fiscal and program integrity, beneficiary protections and support, and monitoring and oversight. However, establishing national standards and other state requirements can add state administrative burdens to come into compliance. The Biden-Harris Administration\u2019s most recent budget proposed requiring Medicaid managed care plans to meet a minimum MLR of 85% (the statutory requirement for Medicare Advantage plans) and requiring states to collect remittances from plans if they fail to meet the required minimum (which would likely result in Medicaid savings)\u2014to encourage plan investment in services and quality improvement and to prevent the retention of excessive profits.\n\nThe Trump Administration finalized changes to Medicaid managed care rules with chief goals that differed from Democratic administrations. The Trump Administration\u2019s stated goals included reducing state and federal administrative burden, streamlining regulations, and promoting state flexibility and innovation in care delivery; however, tradeoffs could include fewer beneficiary protections, less oversight involving access to care, and variation in oversight across states.\n\n(Back to top)\n\nAppendix",

        "text": "Nostradamus of presidential election predictions Allan Lichtman says Kamala Harris will win 2024\nAhead of ABC's September 10 debate in Philadelphia between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, the American University historian Allan Lichtman, dubbed as the \u2018Nostradamus\u2019 of the presidential election, has sounded the alarm for this year's results. U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, U.S. August 20, 2024 and former U.S. President Donald Trump in Bedminster, New Jersey, U.S., August 15, 2024 are seen in a combination of file photographs. (REUTERS)\n\nLichtman was one of the few to correctly predict that the Republican presidential hopeful would win in 2016. Following his prior \u201cGOOD CALL,\u201d as Trump hailed it, the American University professor also claimed after the Biden vs Trump debate that the former dropping out of the presidential race could be a \u201ctragic mistake for Democrats.\u201d\n\nHowever, now that Vice President Kamala Harris has taken over the presidential candidate duties for the Democratic party, Lichtman has forecast, two months in advance, that the first female, first black and first Asian-American VP would prevail over Trump on November 5.\n\nFYI, Dr. Allan Lichtman\u2014a registered Democrat\u2014has a near-perfect record of predicting elections, as he has accurately predicted nine out of the last ten results, as reported by The New York Post.\n\nAlso read | After Biden accused Russia of poll intervention, Putin 'endorses' Kamala Harris\n\nWhat are the election \u2018Nostradamus\u2019 Dr Allan Lichtman's predictions based on?\n\nAccording to a New York Times video posted on Thursday, September 5, Lichtman's presidential pick for next term is Kamala Harris. Harris is leading Trump in eight of these categories per his \u201cKey to the White House\u201d analysis, which looks at 13 \u201ckeys\u201d to determine a candidate's prospects of conquering the election. Meanwhile, Trump has three.\n\nOf the 13 categories Lichtman labels as \u201cthe constant northern star of political predictions,\u201d these are the eight \u201ckeys\u201d Harris won over:\n\n\u201cWhether the party in the White House is facing a primary\u201d \u201cWhether there\u2019s a third-party contestant\u201d \u201cThe state of the short-term economy\u201d \u201cThe state of the long-term economy\" \u201cWhether the sitting president\u2019s party has made adjustments to national policy\u201d \u201cWhether there\u2019s social unrest\u201d Whether the president faced major scandals \u201cThe charisma of the challenger\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Trump prevailed over Harris in these three \u201ckeys\u201d:\n\n\u201cWhether the sitting president\u2019s party gained seats in the House during the midterms\u201d \u201cWhether the incumbent is running for re-election\u201d \u201cThe charisma of the incumbent\u201d\n\nAlso read | Melania Trump teases \u2018deeply personal\u2019 book that will tell \u2018The Truth\u2019\n\nOther two categories that didn't align with either candidate, according to Lichtman, were:\n\n\u201cWhether there were any major fiascos in foreign policy\u201d\n\n\u201cWhether the sitting president had successes in foreign affairs\u201d\n\nAmerican University professor doesn't see Trump regaining the White House\n\nThe 77-year-old historian explained, \u201cForeign policy is tricky, and these keys could flip. The Biden administration is deeply invested in the war in Gaza, which is a humanitarian disaster with no end in sight.\"\n\n\u201cBut even if both foreign policy keys flipped false, that would mean that there were only five negative keys, which would not be enough for Donald Trump to regain the White House,\u201d Lichtman continued in the video.\n\nIn early August, US election \u2018Nostradamus\u2019 even pushed that Ohio Senator JD Vance's presence as Trump's VP pick would influence the outcome.\n\nForegrounding the vice president choice as \u201cincredibly important,\u201d Lichtman implied on his YouTube channel that the veep should be someone who could effectively take the reins if the president steps down for any reason. \u201cThat's why JD Vance was such a disastrous pick; he would be a horror show as president.\u201d",

Historian who accurately predicted 9 of last 10 makes 2024 pick\nPresidential predictor Allan Lichtman, who has correctly called the winner of nearly every presidential election since the 1980s, has announced his final prediction for the 2024 presidential election.\n\nIn a NYT Opinion video released Thursday morning, Lichtman says he believes Vice President Kamala Harris will win the race for the White House this November.\n\nLichtman is not a psychic, he's a historian. He told FOX News earlier this year that the formula he's used to correctly predict nearly every presidential race since 1984, his \"Keys to the White House,\" which was developed in 1981 with mathematician Vladimir Keilis-Borok and is based on their analysis of presidential elections dating back to 1860. The secret to his success, Lichtman says, is to keep his own personal preferences out of his predictions.\n\nLichtman explained his decision in the video, saying Harris secured the majority of his \u2018 13 Keys to the White House \u2019, making her the candidate most likely to win the race.\n\nLichtman is expected to discuss further his latest prediction Thursday night at 9:00 p.m. on his YouTube channel.\n\nALLAN LICHTMAN'S 13 THE KEYS TO THE WHITE HOUSE:\n\nKEY 1 (Party Mandate)\n\nKEY 2 (Contest)\n\nKEY 3 (Incumbency)\n\nKEY 4 (Third Party)\n\nKEY 5 (Short-Term Economy)\n\nKEY 6 (Long-Term Economy)\n\nKEY 7 (Policy Change)\n\nKEY 8 (Social Unrest)\n\nKEY 9 (Scandal)\n\nKEY 10 (Foreign/Military Failure)\n\nKEY 11 (Foreign/Military Success)\n\nKEY 12 (Incumbent Charisma)\n\nKEY 13 (Challenger Charisma)\n\n\"The keys are an alternative to the polls, which are not predictors. They're snapshots, they're abused, not used as predictors. And the pundits, you know, who are a lot of fun, but they're sports talk radio. They have no scientific basis for any of their predictions,\" Lichtman told FOX.\n\nLichtman has correctly predicted the outcome of nine out of the last ten presidential elections, with the exception being the race in 2000, in which Republican George W. Bush defeated Democrat Al Gore.\n\nWith just 60 days until the Nov. 5 election, both candidates still have a lot of ground to cover as both campaigns are focusing their efforts on the seven key battleground states that could determine the outcome of the election.\n\nFOX 5 DC and FOX News contributed to this report.",

        "text": "Five disinformation tactics Russia is using to try to influence the US election\nThe White House\u2019s recent exposure of Russian attempts to influence this year\u2019s US presidential election will come as little surprise to anyone who followed disinformation tactics during the last US election.\n\nDuring the 2020 campaign, the Kremlin used its state-sponsored media outlets, the international television channel RT and the news website and radio station Sputnik, to pump out a raft of content calling the legitimacy of the US democratic process into question. Networks of Russia-sponsored bots and trolls were also found to have been pushing divisive disinformation and conspiracy theories in online networks.\n\nThis time around, the US has seized a network of Russian-run internet domains, and sanctioned ten people including Margarita Simonyan, editor-in-chief of RT (formerly Russia Today), for \u201cactivities that aim to deteriorate public trust in our institutions\u201d. Sanctions include freezing any property or assets in the US, and potentially restrictions on any US citizen or company that works with them.\n\nThe US has also charged two Moscow-based managers of RT, Konstantin Kalashnikov and Elena Afanasyeva, under money laundering law with paying US content creators to push out \u201cpro-Russia propaganda and disinformation\u201d in the US.\n\nUS attorney general Merrick Garland said Russia was looking to create its \u201cpreferred outcome\u201d in the upcoming presidential election, and undermine US support for Ukraine in the war.\n\nThe practices alleged by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) closely match what my co-authors and I have identified in our new book, Russia, Disinformation and the Liberal Order, as having become standard practice in Russian attempts to influence international audiences.\n\nHere are five key features of Russian information manipulation we identified, and which can help understand the latest election-meddling scandal.\n\n1. Using local influencers\n\nThe DOJ charges that RT employees paid a Tennessee-based firm nearly US$10 million (\u00a37.5 million) to produce social media content that aligns with Russian interests without disclosing that the funding ultimately came from the Russian state.\n\nSeveral of the influencers connected to the Tennessee firm have since said they had editorial control over their content, and denied knowledge of any links to Russia. But this fits patterns identified in our research.\n\nFirst, RT has long worked with the populist right-wing media space, and often mimics the style and practices of US right-wing populist media. It frequently links to their pieces on its website and has promoted right-wing media personalities and distributed their shows, as well as featuring them on its own platforms.\n\nBuilding on this, RT has often given a platform, financing and free rein to media personalities from the states they are targeting, whose genuinely held beliefs suit Russia\u2019s own interests. After all, research confirms that people are more likely to believe claims they have heard time and time again, whether or not those claims are true.\n\n2. Fake news outlets\n\nAs part of this case, the US has seized a network of internet domains alleged to have been used to promote false information targeted at specific subsets of the US population. Masquerading as local sites, their content tends to tap into the specific social concerns and controversies that resonate with particular target groups, as well as amplifying core Russian talking points.\n\nWe have seen this in the past, when the Kremlin-backed Internet Research Agency set up a fake left-wing news site and conned unwitting freelancers into contributing content for Russian information operations. RT\u2019s past activities show it has no qualms with deliberately camouflaging its links to other media operations and groups.\n\nWe know from our research that these sites not only habitually cross-reference each other, they also frequently cross-reference other self-styled counter-mainstream sites to boost their credibility with particular online demographics.\n\n3. Adding fuel to the fire\n\nAnother common tactic for keeping content believable is linking it to the fears and concerns that are already important in any society. For example, Russia did not bring the culture war to the US, but it has skilfully tapped into American society\u2019s anxieties around the topic. Russian media operations have brought these to the fore without engaging with them in any meaningful way.\n\nSimilarly, when Russian sites masquerade as local sources, they prioritise themes that are familiar to their target audiences. Usually, though, divisive topics are embellished with a patchwork of real and fabricated information. Audiences find it hard to pick them apart, and their starting assumptions mean they often aren\u2019t motivated to try.\n\nFrederic Sierakowski/EPA\n\n4. Flipping the script\n\nMoscow has repeatedly denied any involvement in influence campaigns, just as it did in 2018 when the UK accused the Russian state of a series of Novichok poisonings in Salisbury. Back then, Russian politicians and media boosted a complex web of conspiracy theories that mirrored the accusations back at the UK and US security services.\n\nWe have seen the \u201cflipped script\u201d response from Russia\u2019s representatives again this time around. Moscow\u2019s ambassador to Washington, Anatoly Antonov, dismissed US allegations as a product of \u201cRussophobia\u201d \u2013 the same term used by the Russian embassy following the Salisbury poisonings.\n\nRead more: Chinese and Russian disinformation flourishes in some African countries \u2013 anti-US sentiment helps it take hold\n\nAnd Russia\u2019s foreign ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, has repeated her favourite theme of recent years, accusing the US of becoming a \u201ctotalitarian neoliberal dictatorship\u201d. This might seem laughable from the representative of a state that has criminalised criticism of its invasion of Ukraine. However, bare-faced lies and humorous dismissals often go together in Russia\u2019s information operations.\n\n5. Humour\n\nThe Russian state routinely uses humour strategically, and RT has emerged as something of a pioneer in using humour to legitimise Russia\u2019s actions or neutralise critiques.\n\nHowever, the network doesn\u2019t only use humour to report on international politics. Its trademark approach is to knowingly include itself as part of the joke. Several RT advertising campaigns have used foreign criticisms as a selling point.\n\nThe same spirit was clear in the sarcastic response of Simonyan to the latest allegations. In comments posted to Telegram and gleefully reproduced by RT, the editor-in-chief dismissed the charges as US scaremongering \u201cabout the almighty RT\u201d. Her words are a perfect example of how RT revels in its status as a \u201cpopulist pariah\u201d.\n\nRussia continues to refine the way it tries to influence agendas outside its borders, and there\u2019s no suggestion this will stop any time soon.",

        "text": "These Are the Rules of the ABC Presidential Debate\nVice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump will face off for the first time on Sept. 10, when the two presidential candidates are set to debate each other ahead of the presidential election.\n\nThe 90-minute debate will be hosted by ABC News in Philadelphia\u2019s National Constitution Center at 9 p.m. ET, and will closely mirror the format used by CNN in the June debate between Trump and President Joe Biden. Both candidates will have two minutes to answer questions and two-minute rebuttals, with an additional minute to each candidate for follow-ups or clarifications. There will be no live audience, and both candidates will stand for the entire debate.\n\nThe terms had been somewhat contentious after Trump suggested he might back out and Harris\u2019s campaign sought to change the rule on muted microphones, which will only be live when it is the candidate\u2019s turn to speak. The two campaigns agreed to the ground rules set by ABC on Wednesday, setting up a critical opportunity for Harris and Trump to present their platforms and address the electorate as the Nov. 5 election approaches.\n\nThe two candidates are polling almost evenly in most key battleground states. New CNN/SSRS polls released Wednesday found that Harris is just barely ahead of Trump but within the margin of error in Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, and Wisconsin, while Trump leads by 5 points in Arizona and the two candidates are tied in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe last presidential debate proved to be a major turning point in the 2024 election cycle, with Biden's poor performance leading to his abrupt withdrawal from the race. His exit set the stage for Harris to lock up the Democratic nomination, creating a new dynamic in the race against Trump. The former President said in a Fox News town hall Wednesday that his strategy for the debate against Harris is to \u201clet her talk\u201d and to \u201csort of feel it out as the debate is taking place.\u201d\n\nRead More: Presidential Debates in History That Moved the Needle\n\nThe two candidates have not yet agreed to a second debate, though Trump proposed an additional meeting on Sept. 25 on NBC News.\n\nHere\u2019s a preview of the rules and what to expect in the Sept. 10 debate.\n\nNo live audience\n\nLike the June debate, the Trump-Harris event will not have a live studio audience in an attempt to minimize disruptions during the debate. The move marks a departure from previous events, which have typically featured audience members who are instructed to remain quiet while the candidates are speaking.\n\nThe rule change was initially set by the Biden campaign, which argued in May that the debate commission\u2019s \u201cmodel of building huge spectacles with large audiences at great expense simply isn\u2019t necessary or conducive to good debates.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe debates should be conducted for the benefit of the American voters, watching on television and at home \u2014 not as entertainment for an in-person audience with raucous or disruptive partisans and donors, who consume valuable debate time with noisy spectacles of approval or jeering,\u201d the Biden campaign said at the time.\n\nMuted microphones\n\nAlso like the previous debate, microphones will be muted throughout the proceedings except when it is the candidate's turn to speak, a measure aimed at curtailing interruptions that have marred previous debates.\n\nThe standoff over microphones had threatened to derail the debate, with the Harris campaign calling for unmuted microphones. Trump had said the microphone rule \u201cdoesn\u2019t matter to me\u201d and that he would \u201crather have it probably on, but the agreement [for the Sept. 10 debate] was that it was the same as it was last time.\u201d\n\nThe Harris campaign ultimately agreed to the muted microphone rule but said in a letter to ABC that she \u201cwill be fundamentally disadvantaged by this format, which will serve to shield Donald Trump from direct exchanges with the Vice President.\"\n\n\"Notwithstanding our concerns, we understand that Donald Trump is a risk to skip the debate altogether, as he has threatened to do previously, if we do not accede to his preferred format. We do not want to jeopardize the debate. For this reason, we accepted the full set of rules proposed by ABC, including muted microphones,\" the letter said.\n\nHowever, unlike the Biden-Trump debate, a pool of White House reporters will be in the hall to hear any remarks that are muted for the wider television audience, according to the Associated Press.\n\nNo opening statements\n\nUnlike debates in previous election cycles, there will be no opening statements. Instead, each candidate will deliver a two-minute closing statement at the conclusion of the debate. The debate will begin with the moderators introducing the candidates followed by a question, with candidates each allotted two minutes to respond. This will be followed by one-minute rebuttals and responses to the rebuttals.\n\nHarris and Trump will not be permitted to ask questions of each other, and ABC News said that no topics or questions will be shared in advance with campaigns or candidates. The debate will be moderated by ABC\u2019s David Muir and Linsey Davis.\n\nRead More: Breaking Down the 2024 Election Calendar\n\nSetup\n\nBoth Harris and Trump will stand at identical lecterns for the entire 90-minute debate, and a virtual coin flip administered by ABC News on Tuesday determined podium placement and the order of closing statements. Trump won the coin toss and decided to speak last during closing statements, while Harris selected the right podium position on the screen.\n\nEach candidate will be provided with a pen, notepad, and a bottle of water on stage. No props or written notes will be allowed.\n\nCommercial breaks\n\nSimilar to the June debate, the event will feature two commercial breaks during the 90-minute broadcast\u2014a departure from traditional debates. However, campaign staff will be prohibited from interacting with their respective candidates during these intermissions, denying them the opportunity for strategic consultations or to touch up the candidates\u2019 appearance.\n\nMore from TIME",

This indicates sustained political strength and public support. No Primary Contest: This key is true if there is no serious contest for the incumbent party's nomination. A lack of serious challengers within the party suggests a unified front and broad support for the sitting president or the designated successor. Incumbent Seeking Re-election: This key is true if the sitting president is running for re-election. An incumbent president often has an advantage due to visibility and established leadership. No Third Party: This key is true if there is no significant third-party or independent candidate running in the election. The absence of a major third-party campaign tends to consolidate votes around the two main parties, reducing the likelihood of vote splitting that could harm the incumbent party. Strong Short-term Economy: This key is true if the economy is not in recession during the election campaign. A stable or growing economy close to the election generally favours the incumbent party. Strong Long-term Economy: This key is true if real per capita economic growth during the term equals or exceeds the mean growth during the previous two terms. Sustained economic growth over the president\u2019s term signals effective economic management. Major Policy Change: This key is true if the incumbent administration has made major changes in national policy, showing a proactive and effective governance style that may appeal to voters. No Social Unrest: This key is true if there is no sustained social unrest during the term, which would indicate a stable social environment and effective leadership. No Scandal: This key is true if the incumbent administration is free from major scandals. A scandal-free administration maintains public trust and support. No Foreign or Military Failure: This key is true if the incumbent administration has avoided major failures in foreign or military affairs. Such failures can severely damage a president\u2019s image and public confidence. Major Foreign or Military Success: This key is true if the administration achieves a significant success in foreign or military affairs. Such successes can bolster the president\u2019s standing and demonstrate effective leadership on the global stage. Charismatic Incumbent: This key is true if the incumbent party candidate is charismatic or regarded as a national hero, traits that can sway undecided voters and energise the base. Uncharismatic Challenger: This key is true if the challenging party candidate lacks charisma or is not seen as a national hero. A less dynamic or less inspiring opponent can diminish the chances of the challenging party\u2019s success.\n\nLichtman\u2019s Assessment of the Keys for the Upcoming Election:\n\nNew York Times\n\nMidterm Gains - False for Harris Incumbency - False for Harris Primary Contest - True for Harris Third Party - True for Harris Short-Term Economy - True for Harris Long-Term Economy - True for Harris Policy Change - True for Harris Social Unrest - True for Harris Scandal - True for Harris Incumbent Charisma - False for Harris Challenger Charisma - True for Harris Foreign Policy Failure - Not sure Foreign Policy Success - Not sure\n\nWho is Allan Lichtman?\n\nThe Case for Impeachment\n\nRenowned American election forecaster Allan Lichtman, often referred to as the \" Nostradamus of US presidential elections ,\" has predicted that Vice President and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris will win the upcoming race for the White House and become the next US President.The US presidential election is scheduled for 5th November, with just two months left for American voters to decide who will succeed Joe Biden.The contest is between Kamala Harris and Republican candidate Donald Trump Lichtman, who has a reputation for accurately predicting presidential outcomes for over four decades using his \" Keys to the White House \" model, was among the few forecasters who correctly predicted Donald Trump's victory in 2016 and Joe Biden's win in 2020. He now forecasts that Kamala Harris will be the next President of the United States.As a professor of history at American University for 50 years, Lichtman developed the famous \"13 Keys to the White House\" method, which is considered a strong indicator of election results. This method involves 13 true/false questions, with Lichtman predicting a loss for the incumbent party if six or more keys are unfavourable. If fewer than six are against it, the incumbent party is predicted to win.In a video for the, Lichtman explained the \"Keys to the White House,\" noting that Kamala Harris has eight keys in her favour, while Donald Trump has five negative keys, suggesting he will not return to the White House.The \"13 Keys to the White House,\" developed by Allan Lichtman and Vladimir Keilis-Borok , are a set of true/false statements used to predict the outcome of US presidential elections. Each key represents a condition that favours the re-election of the incumbent party. If six or more keys are false, the incumbent party is predicted to lose. Here is a breakdown of the 13 keys:Here\u2019s what Lichtman told theabout each key, which he measures as True or False. A False for Harris is considered a win for Trump:Lichtman points out that the last two keys on foreign policy could change depending on developments in the Middle East, but even then, Harris has eight out of the 13 keys in her favour, indicating she will emerge victorious.Allan Lichtman is a distinguished American historian, author, and political analyst, best known for his unique approach to predicting US presidential elections. Born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1947, Lichtman has spent much of his career at American University in Washington, D.C., where he has been a professor of history since 1973. Over the decades, Lichtman has gained a reputation not just for his academic contributions but also for his groundbreaking work in the field of political forecasting.Lichtman's most notable contribution to political science is his \"Keys to the White House\" model, developed in collaboration with Russian seismologist Vladimir Keilis-Borok. The model is based on a set of 13 true or false questions, or \"keys,\" that evaluate the strength of the incumbent party's hold on the presidency. These keys encompass a range of factors, from economic performance and foreign policy successes to social unrest and scandal. If six or more of the keys are false, the model predicts that the incumbent party will lose the presidency. Remarkably, this model has correctly predicted every US presidential election since its inception in 1984, often far in advance of the actual election day. The model even predicted Donald Trump's unexpected victory in 2016, demonstrating its robustness and the soundness of its underlying principles.Lichtman's predictive model diverges from traditional polling and data analytics by focusing on broad historical patterns rather than short-term electoral dynamics. According to Lichtman, elections are less about individual candidates and more about the performance and perception of the party in power. This perspective challenges the conventional wisdom of relying heavily on polling data, campaign strategies, or public sentiment captured through social media or other contemporary tools. Instead, his model's success rests on a long-term historical view, suggesting that elections are a referendum on the performance of the party in power rather than a choice between two candidates.Beyond his election predictions, Allan Lichtman has authored several books and scholarly articles on a range of topics, including American political history, civil rights, and climate change. His book, published in 2017, argued for the impeachment of then-President Donald Trump based on a series of alleged constitutional violations and ethical breaches. Lichtman\u2019s work often intersects with contemporary political debates, and he is a frequent commentator on national television, where his insights are sought after for their historical context and analytical depth.Lichtman's academic background and approach to history are grounded in quantitative methods, which has allowed him to apply statistical analysis to historical and political phenomena. This interdisciplinary approach sets him apart in the field of history, where narrative and qualitative analysis often dominate. Lichtman\u2019s work has thus bridged the gap between history and political science, bringing a historian's long view to the often-frenetic world of political forecasting.In addition to his scholarly work, Lichtman has also been involved in political activism. He ran for the US Senate in Maryland in 2006 as a Democrat, advocating for progressive policies such as universal healthcare, environmental protection, and campaign finance reform. Although his bid was unsuccessful, it underscored his commitment to engaging directly with the political processes he studies.",

The American University distinguished professor has predicted the results of every presidential race since 1984 . His forecasts are based on a historical index model he dubs the \"Keys to the White House\"",
        "text": "Harris will beat Trump, says election prediction legend Allan Lichtman\nVice President Kamala Harris, left, at the White House, Washington, July 22, 2024, and former President Donald Trump in Bedminster, New Jersey, Aug. 15, 2024.\n\nThe results are in, and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris will defeat Republican rival Donald Trump in the Nov. 5 election \u2014 at least according to the historian dubbed the \"Nostradamus\" of presidential election predictions.\n\nIt's the latest election prophecy from Allan Lichtman, an American University distinguished professor who boasts of having successfully predicted the results of every U.S. presidential race since 1984.\n\nLichtman revealed his decision Thursday morning in an op-ed video for The New York Times.\n\n\"The Democrats will hold on to the White House, and Kamala Harris will be the next president of the United States,\" Lichtman said in the video.\n\n\"At least, that's my prediction for this race.\"\n\nHis forecasts are based on a historical index model he dubs the \"Keys to the White House.\"\n\nThe unique system, which he developed in the early 1980s with the Russian geophysicist Vladimir Keilis-Borok, analyzes the political landscape through the lens of 13 true-false statements focused on the incumbent president's party.\n\nIf six or more of the statements are false, then the challenger \u2014 in this case, Trump \u2014 is predicted to win.\n\nHere are the keys, and Lichtman's determinations for each:\n\nParty Mandate: After the midterm elections, the incumbent party holds more seats in the U.S. House of Representatives than it did after the previous midterm elections. FALSE Contest: There is no serious contest for the incumbent-party nomination. TRUE Incumbency: The incumbent-party candidate is the sitting president. FALSE Third party: There is no significant third-party or independent campaign. TRUE Short-term economy: The economy is not in recession during the election campaign. TRUE Long-term economy: Real per-capita economic growth during the term equals or exceeds mean growth during the previous two terms. TRUE Policy change: The incumbent administration effects major changes in national policy. TRUE Social unrest: There is no sustained social unrest during the term. TRUE Scandal: The incumbent administration is untainted by major scandal. TRUE Incumbent charisma: The incumbent-party candidate is charismatic or a national hero. FALSE Challenger charisma: The challenging-party candidate is not charismatic or a national hero. TRUE Foreign/military failure: The incumbent administration suffers no major failure in foreign or military affairs. Foreign/military success: The incumbent administration achieves a major success in foreign or military affairs.\n\nOn the final two keys, Lichtman said, \"Foreign policy is tricky, and these keys could flip.\"\n\nHe noted that the Biden administration is deeply involved in Israel's war in Gaza, which he called a \"humanitarian disaster with no end in sight.\"\n\n\"But even if both foreign policy keys flipped false, that would mean that there were only five negative keys, which would not be enough for Donald Trump to regain the White House,\" Lichtman told the Times.\n\nLichtman's analysis largely eschews poll results, campaign strategies, sound bites, policy plans and other factors that most political commentators and analysts tend to lean on.\n\nBut his system has yielded results.\n\nLichtman was one of the few political analysts to accurately predict ahead of the 2016 election that Trump would defeat then-Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. However, Lichtman's model indicated that Trump would win the popular vote, which he lost despite securing the Electoral College.\n\nLichtman accurately predicted that President Joe Biden would beat Trump in the 2020 race.",

        "text": "Ahead of the US presidential debate, how are Harris and Trump preparing?\nExperts weigh in on the strategies the Democratic and Republican candidates may deploy on Tuesday\u2019s debate stage.\n\nWashington, DC \u2013 On one side of the stage will be the prosecutor, seeking to dismiss her opponent as a danger to democracy and a vestige of the past.\n\nAnd on the other will be the real estate magnate, blasting his rival as an ultra-liberal politician who will regulate the economy into stagnation.\n\nTuesday\u2019s presidential debate will be the first opportunity for Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump to meet face-to-face as they spar over the future of the United States.\n\nAnd the two candidates have been sharpening their attacks and plotting a strategy to pull ahead in their neck-and-neck race.\n\nThe televised debate, hosted by ABC News, may well turn out to be the only opportunity for Harris and Trump to confront one another in person before the November 5 election.\n\nAnd that means the stakes are high. Aaron Kall, a professor at the University of Michigan, studies presidential debates and warns not to dismiss their importance.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t win you an election, but certainly they can lose it,\u201d Kall said.\n\nThe shadow of June\u2019s debate\n\nThe showdown in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, is the second presidential debate this election cycle.\n\nBut experts said the casualties of the first debate should serve as a warning for the participants this time around.\n\nThe first debate took place on June 27, and it was the lightning rod that took down President Joe Biden\u2019s re-election campaign.\n\nThe presumptive Democratic candidate at the time, Biden faltered as he faced Trump on the debate stage, trailing off mid-sentence and failing to articulate basic talking points.\n\nHis feeble performance led to a crescendo of concerns over the 81-year-old\u2019s age and ability.\n\nLess than a month later, Biden had dropped out of the race, and Harris soon replaced him as the Democratic nominee.\n\nBut experts say the events of the transformative June debate will loom large as Harris and her Republican rival Trump craft their strategies for Tuesday. Some predict Biden\u2019s bellyflop may even bring more eyeballs to Tuesday\u2019s debate.\n\n\u201cThe Biden and Trump debate, you can say in a declarative sentence, was the most consequential presidential debate in American history,\u201d Barbara Perry, a presidential historian at the University of Virginia, told Al Jazeera. \u201cSo it shows the stakes are real and high.\u201d\n\nKall, meanwhile, pointed to the June debate as evidence that a high-profile blunder can cost a candidate the election.\n\n\u201cIn a 90-minute debate, you can make a mistake or gaffe or do something that brands you going forward \u2014 like Biden not having the stamina to do another four years,\u201d he said.\n\nHarris\u2019s strategy\n\nBoth the Harris and Trump campaigns have been mum about the tactics they plan to use for Tuesday\u2019s debate. After all, airing their strategies in public could blunt their efficacy.\n\nBut Harris\u2019s team appears to be hoping to give Trump a runway to crash his own plane.\n\nHer campaign unsuccessfully called for Trump\u2019s microphone to be unmuted between questions, to allow him to speak out of turn.\n\nThat was a reversal of what Biden\u2019s campaign had pushed for in June. Biden\u2019s team had hoped a muted microphone would stymy the outburst-prone Trump, particularly with no audience in attendance.\n\nInstead, \u201cit backfired\u201d, according to Kall. He believes the silence gave Trump a more staid appearance, one that emphasised Biden\u2019s stumbles.\n\nHarris\u2019s team appeared to be hoping for a repeat of an earlier Trump and Biden debate, in Cleveland in 2020, when Trump made numerous interjections that read as chaotic. In turn, Biden was seen to come out on top.\n\nHowever, the Harris campaign\u2019s request to keep Trump\u2019s microphone unmuted was ultimately denied.\n\nMatthew Levendusky, a political science professor at the University of Pennsylvania, said another Harris priority will be to use the debate stage to establish herself with the US public.\n\nHarris only launched her presidential campaign seven weeks ago. She has therefore had far less time in the national spotlight than Trump.\n\nBut critics point to her past debate performances as a positive sign going into Tuesday\u2019s event.\n\nDuring the 2020 election cycle, for instance, Harris took part in Democratic presidential primary debates, and she generated buzz for landing successful punches on her future boss Biden.\n\nShe also excelled in a policy-heavy vice presidential debate against Mike Pence during the general election that same year.\n\nHarris \u2014 the former district attorney of San Francisco and attorney general of California \u2014 has a prosecutorial style, something she exercised during her time in the Senate. Her hard-knuckle questions during Senate committee hearings gained her a national profile.\n\nLevendusky said Harris will aim to reprise that role on Tuesday\u2019s debate stage. She will be \u201clooking to come off as tough and grill Trump and show that she can rebut him\u201d, he told Al Jazeera.\n\n\u201cBut of course, the danger for her is that, as a woman of colour, she\u2019s in a tough position given race and gender stereotypes about appropriate behaviour,\u201d Levendusky added. \u201cSo far, she seems to be very effectively managing that tightrope, and this is her chance to highlight these skills on an even larger stage.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s \u2018sixth sense\u2019\n\nTrump, meanwhile, will be making his seventh appearance in a general election debate \u2014 more than any candidate in US history.\n\nHe continues to be powered by one entrenched factor, according to Perry: He seems impervious to the standards applied to other candidates and their behaviour. His base will support him no matter what.\n\n\u201cWhatever rules there were have become immaterial to him,\u201d Perry said. \u201cHe can\u2019t be pinned down, and he can\u2019t be countered, because it doesn\u2019t matter to the people who are locked into voting for him.\u201d\n\nBut experts like Perry warn that Trump needs to expand his appeal beyond his base in order to win the election this November.\n\nPerry pointed out that Trump only won the presidency in 2016 thanks to the Electoral College, a system of weighted voting where \u201celectors\u201d are awarded based on state election results. The candidate who wins the most votes in a given state often wins all of that state\u2019s electors.\n\nIn both 2016 and 2020, however, Trump lost the national popular vote \u2014 earning fewer votes overall than his Democratic rivals in each case.\n\nThat means Trump still needs to attract voters outside of his staunchest base to ensure victory, according to Perry.\n\nOn the debate stage, Trump \u2014 a former reality TV star \u2014 excels at being a \u201cmoving target\u201d, according to Kall. The Republican has a knack for traipsing through tangents and launching non-sequitur attacks that can be confounding to opponents.\n\nKall pointed out that Trump\u2019s unpredictable debate performances in 2016 proved to be jet fuel for his meteoric rise in politics.\n\nAnd Trump continues to show uncanny instincts when it comes to capitalising on camera-ready, politically significant moments, as evidenced by his defiant fist pump following an assassination attempt in July, Kall said.\n\n\u201cHe made sure the image that was captured was most politically advantageous to him,\u201d Kall explained. \u201cIt\u2019s the same in debates. He has a spidery sixth sense of knowing when there is a key exchange or moment in a debate that everyone\u2019s going to be talking about and could potentially go viral.\u201d\n\nDifferences in preparation\n\nThe lead-up to the debate has also offered an indication of how each candidate may react on the debate stage.\n\nTheir preparation methods reveal a counterpoint in style. Trump has continued to eschew traditional debate preparation for more free-wheeling policy discussions with staffers, according to media reports.\n\nBut Harris has stationed herself in Pennsylvania to practice with mock debates, using a Trump stand-in just as Biden had in the past.\n\nNevertheless, Trump has reportedly tapped Tulsi Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman, to help with his debate preparation. Critics say Gabbard showed a unique ability to shake Harris on the debate stage during the 2020 Democratic primaries.\n\nAt 78, Trump\u2019s advanced age could also be a liability as he faces the 59-year-old Harris. It will be the first time he has publicly grappled with a considerably younger debate opponent in years.\n\nLevendusky pointed out that Trump\u2019s blustery, unrehearsed style has been a double-edged sword \u2014 one that could alienate viewers as much as attract them.\n\n\u201cFor Trump, he wants to do something to disrupt the narrative and take back control of the news cycle,\u201d Levendusky explained. \u201cBut his risk is that he falls into his traditional pattern and that reminds voters of what they disliked about him.\u201d\n\n\u2018Stereotypical tropes\u2019\n\nThe experts who spoke to Al Jazeera also warned that Trump\u2019s approach to his rival\u2019s gender and race could also prove divisive during the debate.\n\nHarris is only the second woman ever to lead a major party\u2019s presidential ticket after Democrat Hillary Clinton faced Trump in 2016. She is also the first Black woman and South Asian woman to lead the party.\n\nOn the debate stage, Harris will deal with societal preconceptions that Trump does not have to contend with, according to Kelly Dittmar, the director of research at the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University-Camden.\n\n\u201cHarris, I\u2019m sure, is being advised in relation to things like tone and showing emotion and reaction to Trump\u2019s types of goading,\u201d Dittmar told Al Jazeera.\n\n\u201cBecause women are more often subjected to claims that they\u2019re overly emotional. There are stereotypical tropes of Black women being angry that she is surely aware of, and you can see evidence in the way that she, very calmly, often in these types of settings, responds.\u201d\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has leaned into sexist attacks throughout his political career, repeatedly labelling Clinton a \u201cnasty woman\u201d and looming behind her during a debate in 2016.\n\nHe also infamously said that Fox News moderator Megyn Kelly had \u201cblood coming out of her wherever\u201d following a Republican primary debate.\n\nDittmar noted that Trump has continued that line of attack with Harris, using gender-coded insults. He has, for example, called Harris \u201cincompetent\u201d, ridiculed her laugh and commented on her physical appearance.\n\nWhether he continues to do so on the debate stage will be an indicator of which audience he seeks to rally.\n\n\u201cLeaning into the hyper-masculinity, the more aggressive approach that he has taken in previous debates, that\u2019s going to land better among his existing base,\u201d Dittmar explained.\n\n\u201cOn the flip side, if he is trying to engage and gain back any support from voters who are \u2014 quote, unquote \u2014 in the middle, you would see him strategically try to emphasise policy differences over that personal kind of rhetoric.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlthough it\u2019s unclear if he can stick to that,\u201d Dittmar added.\n\nThe challenge for Harris, Dittmar said, is to remain unflappable when faced with Trump\u2019s remarks. But she believes Harris has already shown her steady stage presence through her time as a prosecutor and in the Senate.\n\nMaintaining that same level-headed persona during the debate could boost Harris\u2019s chances in the November race.\n\n\u201cPeople typically look for leaders who can be unrattled by these high-pressure moments,\u201d Dittmar said. \u201cThat is somewhere that we already know Harris excels and can it translate into a perception that she is presidential.\u201d",

Kennedy Jr.\n\nHere\u2019s some of what Trump said during the rally:\n\nOn the debate: Trump said the country is run by \u201cstupid people\u201d and that we \u201cfound that out at the debate with Joe (Biden).\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to find it out again on Tuesday night. Is anybody going to be watching?\u201d Trump asked the crowd. The former president predicted that pundits would say he lost the debate, even \u201cif I destroy her.\u201d\n\nPraising RFK Jr.: Trump repeatedly praised Kennedy, saying that with his help, \u201cwe\u2019ll take on the corruption at the FDA, the CDC, World Health Organization and other institutions of public health.\u201d\n\nKennedy, the former independent presidential candidate who has embraced conspiracy theories about vaccines and other issues, has been positioned by the former president to helm a panel investigating chronic health problems in a potential second Trump administration.\n\nOn Boeing and SpaceX: Trump said the Boeing Starliner crew being stuck in space is \u201cembarrassing,\u201d and that Musk, the SpaceX CEO, is \u201cgoing to have to save them.\u201d\n\nTrump continued his public praise of the tech billionaire amid the tightening alliance between the two men.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s very good at what he does,\u201d Trump said of Musk. \u201cLeon\u2019s going to send up a rocket, he looks forward to it,\u201d he added, apparently misstating his ally\u2019s first name.\n\nThe praise of Musk comes days after Trump announced he would appoint Musk to head a newly created government efficiency commission if reelected.\n\nThe ballot in Colorado: Trump said people in Colorado should \u201cdo a major protest vote\u201d in favor of him because of the failed efforts to remove him from the ballot, which had cited the 14th Amendment\u2019s insurrectionist clause in relation to the January 6 Capitol riot.",

        "summary": " Former President George W. Bush has no plans to endorse in the election, his office told NBC News . Bush's office said Saturday that he retired from presidential politics \"years ago\" Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign said on Saturday that she was \"honored\" to have the Cheneys' endorsements . The Cheneys have been critical of former President Donald Trump .",
        "text": "Former President George W. Bush has no plans to endorse in the election\nFormer President George W. Bush does not plan to endorse a candidate for president, his office told NBC News on Saturday.\n\nWhen asked whether the former president or his wife, Laura, would endorse a candidate or make public how they will vote, Bush's office said \"no.\"\n\n\"President Bush retired from presidential politics years ago,\" the office added.\n\nThe Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign declined to comment but pointed to the campaign's Republican outreach efforts.\n\nBush's former vice president, Dick Cheney, announced on Friday that he would back Harris in the November election.\n\n\"In our nation\u2019s 248-year history, there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump,\" Cheney said in a statement. \"He tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him. He can never be trusted with power again.\"\n\nDays earlier, the former vice president's daughter, former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, said that she would cast her ballot for Harris. Both Cheneys, who are Republicans, have been critical of former President Donald Trump, and the younger Cheney has been especially outspoken.\n\nResponding to reporters' questions on Saturday, Harris said that she was \"honored\" to have the Cheneys' endorsements, adding that it \"really reinforces for them that we love our country, and we have more in common than what separates.\"\n\nThe fact that Bush is not endorsing his party's nominee is itself notable. In 2012, Bush said he was backing Republican candidate Mitt Romney against former President Barack Obama. Four years earlier, Bush endorsed the now-late Sen. John McCain for president in 2008.\n\nBoth former Bush presidents' teams said in 2016 that the father and son would avoid commenting on Trump. Instead, the younger Bush worked to support Republican senators. Neither Bush nor his wife voted for either major party presidential nominee in 2016, a spokesperson said that year.\n\nThe elder Bush president died in 2018, but the younger said in 2021 that he wrote in former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice for president in 2020.\n\nSeveral prominent moderate Republicans and former Trump administration officials have broken with the former president and backed Harris, despite having policy differences.\n\nThe Harris campaign last month unveiled more than two dozen endorsements from Republicans, including former Republican Gov. Bill Weld of Massachusetts; former Rep. Denver Riggleman of Virginia; and former Trump administration press secretary Stephanie Grisham.\n\nLater in August, more than 200 former staffers for both Bush presidents, McCain and Romney signed a letter endorsing Harris for president.\n\nAs part of the campaign's outreach to GOP voters, the Harris campaign hired a national Republican engagement director to focus on independent and moderate Republican voters, as well as a Republicans for Harris program.",

        "text": "Could Two New Docs Subtly Change the Presidential Election?\nFormer U.S. Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Il) speaking on the final day of the Democratic National Convention at the United Center on August 22, 2024 in Chicago, Illinois. Kinzinger is the subject of a new documentary that could sway the presidential election. (Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)\n\nAdam Kinzinger had turned down more than a dozen requests to make a documentary. Then the director of Hot Tub Time Machine walked in.\n\nThe Illinois Republican congressman who famously \u2014 and largely solitarily \u2014 turned on Donald Trump after Jan. 6 was reluctant to participate in a movie that focused on his fading hopes to retain his seat. But Steve Pink, the aforesaid auteur of the jacuzzi, wanted to get more personal than that.\n\n\u201cEveryone else was interested in re-election,\u201d Kinzinger said in an interview with THR as the Toronto International Film Festival was set to start Thursday. \u201cBut when I talked to Steve and the team their interest was in the human element \u2014 what\u2019s the cost to you and your future kid?\u201d\n\nThat conversation was more than two years ago. Now the resulting film, The Last Republican, could make an impact on more than just Kinzinger when it premieres at TIFF 2024 on Saturday. That film and Carville \u2014 a Telluride documentary about the maverick consultant James Carville and his long lonesome bid on the other side of the aisle to move the Democrats off Joe Biden \u2014 could thrust movies into the thick of the election. But how much are film companies interested in these stories \u2014 and will it matter in the grand voting scheme if they are?\n\nCarville, at least, has answered the first question. CNN Films bought the movie (subtitle \u201cWinning Is Everything, Stupid\u201d) just before Telluride and will debut it on-air October 5 with an eye toward capitalizing on electoral interest. The Last Republican still seeks its own home when it plays for distributors this weekend, making the case that a good way to defeat Donald Trump is to popularize the backboned Republican who defied him. Submarine is handling sales on the film.\n\n\u201cThings are dark, Trump is still ascendant and shenanigans to call into question this year\u2019s election seem inevitable,\u201d Pink said in an interview. \u201cAnd here\u2019s someone who, even though his political views I abhor on a good day, lives by his beliefs in an active and tangible way. I think that will resonate with people.\u201d\n\nBoth Republican and Carville could make a splash in the 2025 Oscar documentary race, which has seen scattered contenders but few runaway favorites. But the campaign impact could be even greater.\n\nAt a crowded screening Saturday afternoon that included a number of distribution executives, Kinzinger and the Last Republican filmmaking team took the Toronto stage to make their case.\n\n\u201cThis is the wrong job if you\u2019re scared to do the right thing,\u201d Kinzinger told one questioner while also saying that the GOP has \u201clost its mind.\u201d\n\nPink\u2019s movie took shape when he and producer Jason Kohn, known for directing the Andre Agassi documentary \u201cLove Means Zero\u201d circa TIFF 2017, made their bid to Kinzinger that his story belonged on screen. And what a story it is: longtime Air National Guard pilot and conservative ideologue who spoke out against Trump\u2019s role in January 6 and even joined the mostly Democratic Congressional commission, causing Republicans to shun him and eventually re-district him out of office.\n\nA rapport even developed between Pink, an avowed liberal, and Kinzinger; the film suggests an odd-couple affability. \u201cAt some point this started to feel like the national Thanksgiving dinner we haven\u2019t been able to have since 2016,\u201d Kohn said wryly.\n\nThe filmmaker known for the temporal-shifting power of chlorine and the filmmaker who once told of tennis betrayals would not seem like obvious choices for an inside-Rayburn account. But the former\u2019s sense of improbable story and the latter\u2019s ability to capture a maverick serve them well. Kinzinger helps his own cause with a personality that is brash and often funny, a world away from Congressional starch even as he is facing death threats.\n\nTo MAGA Republicans Kinzinger is a Judas; to liberal Democrats he\u2019s a martyr. But even as the 46-year-old courts attention \u2014 he did agree to the movie, after all \u2014 he says he is neither. \u201cI\u2019m not courageous. I\u2019m just surrounded by cowards,\u201d Kinzinger said in the interview, echoing a theme from the film.\n\nFor distributors, the calculus on Last Republican is a tricky one: they could buy the film now and see its value skyrocket if Trump wins. But if Trump is defeated on Nov 5, possibly for the last time, the film might be worth a lot less.\n\nShould a distributor choose to take a flyer on a pre-election release, it could model for solidly Republican voters a way to go against Trump, depicting a man who still did so even though he paid with his career.\n\n\u201cMaybe I\u2019m deluded but I think that a story can compete with Trump\u2019s. Trump\u2019s story is that Adam is disloyal, Adam is a RINO, Adam doesn\u2019t represent his party,\u201d Kohn said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable for a conservative audience to pick up on another story.\u201d On Friday, Dick Cheney furthered that narrative when he added his name to the list of Republicans endorsing Kamala Harris.\n\nA film release would also jolt viewers into recalling the attempted insurrection, depicted here in evocative detail, as well as the many mainline Republicans who quietly about-faced after first condemning Trump. (Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy comes out particularly worse for the wear.)\n\nA party\u2019s dangerous groupthink is also the subject of Matt Tyrnauer\u2019s \u201cCarville,\u201d which shows scene after scene from earlier in the year of its subject in vintage form, joyfully growling, cussing and eye-rolling over what he sees as the party\u2019s dangerous deference to an unelectable incumbent. For months, that seemed to be an irrelevant message.\n\n\u201cIt was almost a lost cause type of movie \u2014 you know, too late the hero,\u201d Tyrnauer recalled in an interview.\n\nThe film was actually being screened for friends and family on the night of the fateful Trump-Biden debate in June. The minute the lights went on in front of Jake Tapper and Dana Bash, Tyrnauer knew he had a new ending on his hands. The film now ends with a pivot to Harris.\n\nStill, Carville now runs the opposite risk \u2014 having been ahead of the curve for months, it could seem like old news. Carville and Tyrnauer say the movie \u2014 which also revisits its subject\u2019s famous work on Bill Clinton\u2019s 1992 campaign, his improbable marriage to Republican operative Mary Matalin and the generally colorful Louisiana personality always beaming from the airport TV \u2014 still carries a timeless message of both the shrewd game of politics and the nobility of public service.\n\nBut the principals also believe their film has a role to play as the campaign heats up. Tyrnauer said an explicit goal was to get it out before balloting begins, while Carville says he sees the film\u2019s potential to influence voters\u2019 2024 behavior.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how many people watching it are going to change their vote, but maybe somebody\u2019s gonna write 100 more postcards or maybe somebody\u2019s gonna volunteer at a phone bank,\u201d Carville said in an interview. \u201cThere are a thousand things people can do to get inspired. My hope is this movie inspires people to get involved with the election.\u201d\n\nA CNN spokeswoman, Jordan Overstreet, declined to comment on the network\u2019s aims for the film.\n\nThe history of movies trying to shift electoral maps is a checkered one. \u201cFahrenheit 9/11,\u201d Michael Moore\u2019s blockbuster 2004 documentary that sought to get people not to vote for George W. Bush, failed in its main goal. But other modern documentaries from \u201cBlackfish\u201d to \u201cCitizenfour\u201d have succeeded in changing consciousness, and experts say that\u2019s not hard to conceive of here.\n\n\u201cThe idea that a filmmaker can make a difference on an election has been proven wrong \u2014 we\u2019ve seen how that doesn\u2019t work too many times,\u201d said veteran documentary expert Thom Powers, who runs the doc section at TIFF. \u201cWhat I think can happen is a film hits the zeitgeist in just the right way and can change how people think. The Last Republican and other films playing at this year\u2019s festival have the potential to do exactly that.\u201d\n\nKinzinger says he\u2019s trying to keep his eye on something even bigger.\n\n\u201cIf you fast-forward to 2124 and the administration of President Zarkon 3 or whatever we\u2019ll call him, we\u2019ll probably still be debating the same issues we\u2019re debating now,\u201d Kinzinger said. \u201cBut we can\u2019t get there if the environment becomes one where people have lost faith in a system and even turn to violence because they think they don\u2019t have a voice.\u201d",

        "text": "WATCH: Trump addresses Fraternal Order of Police in battleground North Carolina\nCHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump accepted a key endorsement from one of the nation\u2019s most influential law enforcement lobbies on Friday by offering a sweeping indictment of the U.S. legal system that has convicted him of almost three dozen felony counts and indicted him in three other pending cases.\n\nWatch Trump\u2019s remarks in our player above.\n\nThe Fraternal Order of Police convention in the battleground state of North Carolina was billed as a way for Trump to pitch himself as a law-and-order figure and cast his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, a former prosecutor and California attorney general, as weak.\n\nBut in between remarks about crime and law enforcement, the former president and Republican nominee celebrated a New York judge\u2019s decision earlier in the day to postpone his sentencing on 34 felony counts in a business fraud case until after Election Day. He repeated his false assertions that the U.S. election system is rife with massive voter fraud and that his 2020 defeat was rigged \u2014 arguments rejected in dozens of state and federal courts. He promised to crack down on \u201cMarxist prosecutors,\u201d and he seemed to suggest that domestic police forces could more actively prevent voter fraud because people are scared of them.\n\nWATCH: With 2 months until Election Day, Harris and Trump prepare for next week\u2019s debate\n\nTrump\u2019s latest broadsides and untruths also underscored the unusual circumstances of a national law enforcement group embracing a political leader who has repeatedly denigrated U.S. institutions and championed a mob of his supporters who assaulted law enforcement officers at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 \u2014 a siege at the core of Trump\u2019s continuing legal peril as he attempts a comeback bid.\n\nBut on Friday, top of mind was the New York case, which he mentioned early on in his remarks. \u201cBig news today is the Manhattan D.A. witch hunt against me has been postponed because everyone realizes that there was no case \u2014 because I did nothing wrong,\u201d Trump said.\n\nPatrick Yoes, the FOP\u2019s national president, said Trump had tamped down the \u201cdefund the police\u201d movement and supported law enforcement in the summer of 2020 during nationwide protests against police brutality after the murder of George Floyd.\n\n\u201cDuring his time in the White House, we had a partner and a leader,\u201d Yoes said. \u201cWe have your back.\u201d\n\nDespite Trump\u2019s status as the only U.S. president in history to be charged or convicted with a felony, the former president used the room of law enforcement officers as a backdrop to attack Harris over crime.\n\n\u201cAmerican cities, suburbs and towns are totally under siege. Kamala Harris and the communist left have unleashed a brutal plague of bloodshed, crime, chaos, misery and death upon their land,\u201d Trump said, adding that police are \u201cnot allowed to do your jobs.\u201d\n\nTrump pledged unyielding support for police, including expanded use of force: \u201cWe have to get back to power and respect.\u201d\n\nAnd he seemingly encouraged police to use their power in the upcoming election to \u201cwatch for voter fraud,\u201d which is rare in the United States despite his insistence to the contrary.\n\n\u201cI hope you as the greatest people \u2026 watch for voter fraud,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope you can watch and you\u2019re all over the place. Watch for the voter fraud. Because we win. Without voter fraud, we win so easily. Hopefully, we\u2019re going to win anyway. But we want to keep it down. You can keep it down just by watching. Because believe it or not, they\u2019re afraid of that badge. They\u2019re afraid of you people.\u201d\n\nFor her part, Harris has showcased her status as a one-time top prosecutor in her home state, regularly saying \u201cI know Donald Trump\u2019s type\u201d after she talks about the \u201cperpetrators of all kinds\u201d in her former roles.\n\nShe\u2019s had some help with that messaging from two officers who were at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and have become surrogates for the Democratic ticket.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump is still that threat,\u201d former Capitol Police Officer Harry Dunn told a group of voters in Arizona this summer. \u201cHis deranged, self-centered, obsessive quest for power is the reason violent insurrectionists assaulted my coworkers and I.\u201d\n\nWATCH: Trump attorneys and prosecutors clash over key details of his election interference case\n\nAhead of Trump\u2019s North Carolina trip, the Harris campaign organized a press call with current and former law enforcement officials, including Dunn, who said Trump only supports police when they\u2019re loyal to him.\n\n\u201cHe put my life and the lives of my fellow Capitol Police officers in danger,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Harris campaign also issued a letter signed by more than 100 law enforcement officials across the country, lauding Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, as \u201cthe only candidates we trust to keep our communities safe\u201d and arguing that Trump \u201cwill sow chaos, defund critical law enforcement agencies, and put all Americans at risk.\u201d\n\nThe FOP joins other police groups that have already lined up behind Trump, including the National Association of Police Organizations and International Union of Police Associations.\n\nTrump\u2019s support from law officers also butts up against sympathies he has shown for those who have defied the orders of police, including his pledge to pardon those charged with beating officers during the Capitol siege.\n\nJudges and juries considering those cases have heard police officers describe being savagely attacked while defending the building. All told, about 140 officers were injured that day, making it \u201clikely the largest single day mass assault of law enforcement\u201d in American history, Matthew Graves, the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, has said.\n\nOver 900 people have pleaded guilty to Jan. 6 crimes, and approximately 200 others have been convicted at trial. More than 950 people have been sentenced, with roughly two-thirds getting time behind bars \u2014 terms ranging from a few days to 22 years.\n\nTrump has long expressed support for Jan. 6 defendants. \u201cThose J6 warriors, they were warriors, but \u2026 they\u2019re victims of what happened,\u201d Trump said at a rally in Nevada this summer. He falsely claimed that police welcomed rioters into the Capitol by saying, \u201cGo in, go in, go in, go in.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s misrepresentation of what happened did not concern his ardent supporters gathered in Charlotte.\n\n\u201cI wish they could let them all out of jail,\u201d said Janice Moody, a retired fingerprint technician with the Las Vegas Police Department and spouse of a retired Las Vegas officer.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they did it on purpose,\u201d she added.",

        "text": "Harris campaign raised $361 million in August, more than double Trump\u2019s fundraising\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Vice President Kamala Harris raised well more than double what former President Donald Trump took in from donors in August, her campaign announced Friday, saying it raised $361 million from nearly 3 million donors in her first full month as a candidate.\n\nTrump\u2019s team had announced Wednesday he brought in $130 million over the same period. Harris\u2019 team says it ended the month with $404 million on hand for the final sprint to Election Day, $109 million more than Trump\u2019s campaign says it had at the end of August.\n\nThe massive Harris war chest is being used to fund a $370 million paid media effort for the final two months of the campaign, and to pay for its more than 2,000 field staff spread through more than 310 offices in battleground states.\n\nWATCH: Harris and Trump campaigns prepare for intense sprint to Election Day\n\nHarris\u2019 fundraising builds on the $310 million she raised in July, the overwhelming majority of which came in after she took over President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign after he dropped out that month. The ticket swap has helped the Democratic party reverse the fundraising edge Trump had developed in the prior months, when voter doubts about Biden\u2019s fitness for another term dampened donor \u2014 and voter \u2014 enthusiasm.\n\n\u201cIn just a short time, Vice President Harris\u2019 candidacy has galvanized a history-making, broad and diverse coalition \u2014 with the type of enthusiasm, energy and grit that wins close elections,\u201d Harris campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said in a statement. \u201cAs we enter the final stretch of this election, we\u2019re making sure every hard-earned dollar goes to winning over the voters who will decide this election.\u201d\n\nThe figures released by both campaigns do not include full Federal Elections Commission filings, which will come later this month. Both campaign totals include fundraising by their respective national parties and associated committees.",

        "text": "Here\u2019s who Russia, Iran and China want to win in the 2024 election, US intelligence officials say\nRussia, Iran and China all have favored candidates in this year\u2019s elections, US intelligence officials said Friday, but America\u2019s adversaries are not in agreement about who would best further their own interests.\n\nWhile the Kremlin wants to swing voters \u201cin favor\u201d of former President Donald Trump and \u201cdiminish the prospects\u201d of Vice President Kamala Harris, the mullahs in Tehran have indicated they would prefer the Democratic nominee over the Republican, officials in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) revealed in an unclassified briefing.\n\nMeanwhile, they said, Beijing appears to care less about who wins the White House, opting to focus on down-ballot races and targeting candidates seen as \u201cthreatening\u201d to its interests.\n\nRegardless of their preferences, all three nations have begun to ramp up election influence efforts ahead of Nov. 5.\n\n\u201cRussia, Iran, and China are trying by some measure to exacerbate divisions in US society for their own benefit, and see election periods as moments of vulnerability,\u201d a readout of the briefing stated.\n\n7 Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines has testified to Congress before about the influence efforts and threats to US elections. Getty Images\n\n\u201cThese actors most likely judge that amplifying controversial issues and divisive rhetoric can serve their interests by making the United States and its democratic system appear weak and by keeping the US Government distracted with internal issues instead of pushing back on their hostile behavior in other parts of the world,\u201d the readout also notes.\n\nWhile there have been no known efforts to actively interfere in the election process, all three governments have stepped up influence campaigns and pushed propaganda \u201cto shape voter preferences.\u201d\n\nAccording to ODNI officials, Russia remains \u201cthe most active foreign influence threat,\u201d with state-controlled media outlets like RT and other US-sanctioned entities pushing messages to \u201cdisseminate Russia-friendly narratives.\u201d\n\n7 According to ODNI officials, Russia remains \u201cthe most active foreign influence threat\u201d in 2024 \u2014 and wants to swing voters \u201cin favor\u201d of former President Donald Trump. Stephen Yang for the New York Post\n\nThe effort \u201cis consistent with Moscow\u2019s broader foreign policy goals of weakening the United States and undermining Washington\u2019s support for Ukraine,\u201d the officials said.\n\nThere have also already been foreign efforts \u201cto compromise political entities\u201d in the US this election cycle, with Iranian agents notably hacking into Trump campaign data.\n\nThough Tehran has targeted both the Trump and Harris campaigns, the government there has specifically \u201cdenigrated the former President,\u201d officials noted, referring to Trump.\n\n7 State-controlled media outlets like RT and other US-sanctioned entities have pushed messages to stoke domestic divisions and \u201cdisseminate Russia-friendly narratives,\u201d according to ODNI. via REUTERS\n\nIn July, an ODNI official said US intelligence agencies had \u201cobserved Tehran working to influence the presidential election, probably because Iranian leaders want to avoid an outcome they perceive would increase tensions,\u201d suggesting Harris could be seen by the Islamic theocratic regime as more amenable.\n\nIran, like Russia, has been able to get its actors to publish fake news articles and adopt false personas to spread its propaganda.\n\nMeanwhile, China is continuing its theme of focusing on House and Senate contests after pursuing the same course in the midterm elections of 2022.\n\n7 Though it has targeted both the Trump and Harris campaigns, Tehran has specifically \u201cdenigrated the former President,\u201d officials added, implying Vice President Harris would be their favored candidate in the White House. Rick Cinclair/Telegram & Gazette / USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nTwo years before, the FBI revealed a vast Chinese espionage effort that involved US officials and several San Francisco-area Democrats \u2014 including Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.).\n\nChristine Fang, aka Fang Fang, a honeytrap acting on behalf of China\u2019s Ministry of State Security, ended up working for several Democratic campaigns and seducing some lawmakers in an attempt to get access to sensitive US intelligence information.\n\nAt least two Midwestern mayors had sex with the Chinese spy \u2014 but Swalwell has declined to discuss specifics about his interactions with Fang.\n\n7 Rather than taking a side in the 2024 presidential contest, China \u201cis focused on influencing down-ballot races,\u201d especially for any candidates that are seen as \u201cthreatening\u201d to its interests. REUTERS\n\n7 Iran, like Russia, has been able to get its actors to publish fake news articles and adopt false personas to spread its propaganda. AFP via Getty Images\n\nAt the same time, the People\u2019s Republic of China has made \u201csmall-scale efforts\u201d to heighten America\u2019s domestic divisions on social media by promoting content about Israel\u2019s war with Hamas, a conflict that has split the Democratic Party\u2019s coalition.\n\nOther foreign influence campaigns against state and local government officials are taking place nationwide, ODNI officials disclosed Friday.\n\nAdditionally, officials said they were aware of some overseas actors weighing outright lobbying of political figures before the election, but did not detail those plots.\n\n7 President Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, evaded charges of violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) before his criminal tax trial this month. AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe warning comes after Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ) was convicted in July of acting as an unregistered foreign agent for both Egypt and Qatar, while Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas) was indicted in May for purportedly taking bribes from an Azerbaijani oil company and a Mexican bank.\n\nFirst son Hunter Biden evaded charges of violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) \u2014 despite evidence that he directly lobbied the US Embassy in Italy to help a Ukrainian gas company land a deal.\n\nHunter pleaded guilty to nine counts of tax fraud on Thursday, more than a month and a half after his father, President Biden, dropped out of the 2024 race.",

        "text": "US presidential polls: Harris leads Trump nationally, but key swing state races tighter\nAs next week\u2019s crucial presidential debate looms into view, Kamala Harris has maintained her narrow lead over Donald Trump in head-to-head polls but is locked in a tighter race in the crucial swing states needed to win the US election.\n\nEver since Harris entered the contest \u2013 after Joe Biden dropped out following a disastrous debate performance that highlighted fears over his age and mental acuity \u2013 the vice-president has ridden a wave of support and enthusiasm, turning the race on its head. A solid but slight Trump advantage morphed into a Harris lead.\n\nBut as Harris faces her first ever debate as a presidential nominee, there are signs that her upwards swing has hit a ceiling. Meanwhile, Trump will be hoping the debate offers his campaign a chance to recapture some momentum.\n\nYet the race remains so tight in the swing states \u2013 and with a Republican advantage in the electoral college \u2013 that one commentator on Politico this week called it the \u201cequivalent of a knife fight in a phone booth\u201d.\n\nAt the same time, the narrow geographical focus of the election is sharply coming into view, with the first ballots to determine the next occupant of the White House due to be mailed out to voters.\n\nNorth Carolina had aimed to start mailing out its presidential ballots on Friday. But in what might be seen as a metaphor for the cliffhanging nature of the contest between Harris and Trump, what should have been standard protocol was delayed by a dispute over whether Robert F Kennedy Jr, hitherto running as an independent candidate, should have a place on the ballot.\n\nKennedy, who suspended his campaign on 23 August and endorsed Trump, is suing the North Carolina board of elections over its refusal to remove his name from the ballot in a state where surveys show the result on a knife edge.\n\nA judge on the state\u2019s supreme court ruled against him on Thursday but gave him 24 hours to appeal \u2013 resulting in a temporary delay to ballots being dispatched. And on Friday, the state\u2019s appeals court issued an interim stop on the dissemination of mail-in ballots to allow Kennedy\u2019s appeal to be heard.\n\nThe postponement added another layer of suspense to a contest that could not be tighter, according to fresh Guardian analysis of recent polls.\n\nIn a state with 16 electoral college votes up for grabs but where a Democratic presidential candidate has won only once since 1980, Trump and Harris are deadlocked at 48.07%.\n\nThe figures illustrate why Kennedy - who is trying to help Trump after concluding that his presence in the race was draining his support - is so keen to remove his name from the ballot.\n\nA tiny number of voters putting their cross next to Kennedy\u2019s name on ballot papers could be enough to deprive Trump of the only one of seven swing states he won in his 2020 defeat at the hands of Joe Biden.\n\nThe North Carolina imbroglio shows in a microcosm what has become a reality of this \u2013 and, increasingly, all \u2013 US presidential elections: that while voters will flock to the polls across all 50 states, some states matter more than others under America\u2019s unique electoral college.\n\nThe system designates a set number of electors for each state based on population \u2013 with 538 for the entire country, meaning that 270 electoral college votes are needed to win.\n\nWhile the outcome in numerous states is a foregone conclusion \u2013 with many southern and midwestern states reliably Republican and others like New York and California solidly Democratic \u2013 the roughly equal partisan division of such states in electoral vote terms means much rests on the small number where party loyalties are evenly split.\n\nIt also means that the national polling figures \u2013 while indicative of overall trends \u2013 are not what necessarily decides the election. The Guardian\u2019s latest national poll tracker, taken over a 10-day average, showed Harris at 47.5% compared with 43.9% for Trump, which is encouraging for her but probably not a big enough cushion to guarantee an electoral college win if replicated on polling day.\n\nIn this context, arguably even more important than North Carolina is Pennsylvania, one of the Democrats\u2019 designated \u201cblue wall\u201d states \u2013 along with fellow battlegrounds Michigan and Wisconsin \u2013 and sometimes given a \u201cRust belt\u201d label because of its status as the heartland of the US steel industry.\n\nBiden won it by slightly more than 80,000 votes in 2020, capturing its 19 electoral votes.\n\nThis time, various permutations suggest that it might be key to the paths being charted by both Harris and Trump to reach the magic 270 total.\n\nThat explains why the state has become such a focal point of both campaigns\u2019 activity in recent days; On Monday, Harris appeared with Biden at a Labor Day parade in Pittsburgh in their first joint campaign appearance since she replaced him atop the Democratic ticket, while Trump attended a televised town hall event hosted by Fox News and fronted by Sean Hannity on Wednesday.\n\nThis Tuesday, the candidates will meet in their only scheduled presidential debate in Philadelphia, the biggest city in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe data shows Harris with a wafer-thin lead in the state of 1.7% \u2013 48.9% to 47.2% \u2013 within the margin of error. Other polls show the race even tighter; a CNN survey this week had candidates tied at 47% each.\n\nThe tight scenario underpins why states like Pennsylvania and North Carolina \u2013 and others like Georgia and two \u201cSun belt\u201d states, Nevada and Arizona \u2013 are now the targets of the lion\u2019s share of campaign resources. Maga Inc, a Trump-backing Super Pac, recently spent a reported $16m in adverts for North Carolina while the Trump campaign has diverted its efforts away from other less winnable locations to focus on the seven battleground states.\n\nIn the war of resources and ad spending, Harris may have the advantage. Figures published on Friday showed her campaign had outraised Trump\u2019s by $361m to $130m in August, and had raised a total of $615m since she became her party\u2019s nominee in July.\n\nIt seems an eye-watering sum and surely enough to sustain a message across this vast country. But the clarion call will be heard loudest in those states where the result is likely to remain too close to call even after polls close.",

        "text": "Prosecutor v felon: US prepares for presidential debate between Harris and Trump\nIt will be a study in contrasts around age, gender, race, temperament and policy. It will also be the first time in US presidential history that a former courtroom prosecutor will take the debate stage alongside a convicted criminal with the White House at stake.\n\nVice-President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, has served as a trial lawyer, district attorney and state attorney general in California. Former US president Donald Trump, her Republican rival, has been convicted of 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up a sex scandal.\n\nThe pair will go head to head in Philadelphia on Tuesday night in their first \u2013 and perhaps only \u2013 debate, just 75 days after Joe Biden\u2019s dire performance against Trump triggered a political earthquake that ultimately forced him from the race for the White House.\n\nFew expect such a transformative result this time. But Trump has his last best chance to end Harris\u2019s extended \u201choneymoon\u201d while the Democrat is aiming to prosecute her opponent\u2019s glaring liabilities before tens of millions of voters watching on live television.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first time Donald Trump is actually going to be cross-examined in front of the American people,\u201d said Tara Setmayer, a former Republican communications director on Capitol Hill. \u201cKamala Harris\u2019s career and experience as a prosecutor, attorney general and a senator is something that Trump should not underestimate in this debate.\u201d\n\nThis will be Trump\u2019s seventh appearance in a national general election debate, making him the most experienced debater in US presidential history. Against Biden in June he repeated familiar falsehoods that mostly went unchallenged. Harris is expected to be a more formidable opponent and could put Trump on the defensive over facts, policy and his conduct following the 2020 election.\n\nView image in fullscreen Kamala Harris campaigns in North Hampton, New Hampshire, on Monday. Photograph: Brian Snyder/Reuters\n\nThe 59-year-old has not been shy about embracing her career in law enforcement so far in the campaign. A video at the recent Democratic national convention in Chicago declared: \u201cThat\u2019s our choice. A prosecutor or a felon.\u201d In a speech accepting the party\u2019s nomination, Harris told cheering delegates: \u201cEvery day, in the courtroom, I stood proudly before a judge and I said five words: Kamala Harris, for the people.\u201d\n\nShe has also been touting her record taking on predators and fraudsters, telling crowds across the country: \u201cI know Donald Trump\u2019s type!\u201d Harris brought that experience to bear in her memorable 2018 cross-examination of Brett Kavanaugh during Senate confirmation hearings after Trump, then president, nominated him as a justice on the supreme court.\n\nBut she is unlikely to go after Trump directly over his convictions \u2013 or three other criminal cases still looming over him. When, at a rally in New Hampshire this week, an audience member shouted, \u201cLock him up!\u201d Harris replied: \u201cWell, you know what? The courts are going to handle that, and we will handle November. How about that?\u201d\n\nIn May Trump became the first former US president to be convicted of felony crimes when a New York jury found him guilty of all 34 charges in a scheme to illegally influence the 2016 election through a hush-money payment to an adult film performer. On Friday the judge, Justice Juan Merchan, delayed Trump\u2019s sentencing until 26 November \u2013 after the election date of 5 November.\n\nFor any other candidate on a debate stage, the convictions would be a huge liability. But Trump has repeatedly rallied his base by falsely claiming that the case, and others relating to election interference and mishandling classified information, are bogus and politically motivated. Should the topic arise on Tuesday, he is likely to cast himself as a martyr and also remind viewers that he was nearly assassinated in July.\n\nThe 90-minute duel, held at Philadelphia\u2019s National Constitutional Center, will be moderated by the ABC News anchors David Muir and Linsey Davis. In accordance with rules negotiated by both campaigns, there will be no live audience and candidates\u2019 microphones will be muted when it is not their turn to speak.\n\nThe same rules seemed to work in Trump\u2019s favour when he took on Biden in Atlanta in June. Aaron Kall, director of debate at the University of Michigan, said: \u201cTrump adjusted well to no audience and the cutting of the microphones in Atlanta. Biden clearly didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cHe had never debated when there\u2019s no audience; same thing with Harris. Not getting any feedback and not knowing how things are going, you have to trust your judgment and who\u2019s got better media instincts than a reality television host?\u201d\n\nThe muting of the microphones may not only save Trump from himself \u2013 he interrupted Biden 71 times during their first presidential debate in 2020 \u2013 but prevent Harris offering sharp rejoinders such as \u201cI\u2019m speaking\u201d, a line she delivered against Mike Pence in the vice-presidential debate four years ago.\n\nHarris and Trump have never met before in person and, in the city of Rocky Balboa, are likely to take on the roles of boxer and fighter respectively. Trump, 78, is not known for his discipline, preparation or fidelity to the truth. His debate performances, like his governing style, are typically based on gut instinct rather than considered analysis.\n\nKall, who has attended many presidential debates, added: \u201cYou can never count him out because he\u2019s just all over the place in kind of a scattershot format and, when you think you\u2019ve got him on something, he quickly moves to something else. It\u2019s hard to keep up with him so she\u2019s got to pick her spots.\n\nView image in fullscreen Donald Trump speaks at the Economic Club of New York on Thursday. Photograph: Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s always been known as the more effective counterpuncher. He sometimes doesn\u2019t lob the first volley or attack or argument but then, if she decides to go on the offensive as a prosecutor and treat him in that way, he can be even more deadly in response.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Stakes \u2014 Presidential Transition Free newsletter We will guide you through the aftermath of the US election and the transition to a Trump presidency Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He has accused her of being a radical leftist while also suggesting she bears responsibility for Biden\u2019s more centrist policy agenda. He has questioned her intelligence and racial identity. He has also floundered in trying to achieve consistency on the incendiary topic of abortion rights.\n\nRepublicans will be hoping that his debate showing is more focused and avoids any blatantly sexist or racist behaviour. The last time he faced a female candidate, Hillary Clinton in 2016, he physically hovered behind her in one debate and referred to her as \u201cthe devil\u201d and a \u201cnasty woman\u201d.\n\nLarry Jacobs, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota, said: \u201cThe Harris campaign was eager for his mic to be live because they think he\u2019s his worst enemy and that\u2019s true. He has a very limited attention span.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a remarkably undisciplined candidate, particularly at this level, and he\u2019s profoundly uncomfortable with women and people of colour. I don\u2019t see any change in that orientation. Already in this campaign he\u2019s come out with some pretty offensive comments about Kamala Harris. I\u2019d expect more of that and it\u2019s possible that Kamala Harris is going to push him in ways that might provoke that reaction.\u201d\n\nHarris enters the debate with momentum. After she closed out the convention on 22 August, her campaign announced she had raised more than $500m since entering the race. The polling aggregator website 538 shows Harris up by three percentage points in national polls but much tighter races in some battleground states.\n\nSimon Rosenberg, a Democratic strategist, said: \u201cKamala Harris is a capable politician operating at the height of her powers. She\u2019s going to come and have a good debate and he is, in all likelihood based on his current run of public performances, going to say things that are ugly and shocking and he\u2019ll do further damage to an already damaged campaign.\u201d\n\nBut the vice-president may come under pressure to explain reversals in her positions on issues such as universal healthcare, fracking, plastic straws and decriminalising illegal border crossings. She could face questions over the Biden-Harris administration\u2019s economic record, especially inflation, forcing her both to defend her boss and promise to turn a new page.\n\nLanhee Chen, a fellow in American public policy studies at the Hoover Institution thinktank in Stanford, California, said: \u201cThe substance of what she\u2019s rolled out so far either completely contradicts her past history or they\u2019re just not really good ideas for the most part. If she\u2019s able to actually propose some new ideas in this debate and give people some grist for the mill, that\u2019s a much better approach.\u201d\n\nHistory suggests, however, that debates are less about policy than memorable moments. Examples include Ronald Reagan\u2019s \u201cThere you go again,\u201d tease of Jimmy Carter, George HW Bush\u2019s glance at his watch, Al Gore\u2019s sighs and Trump\u2019s apparent threat to jail Clinton. Political scientists also still question whether the impact on public opinion is fleeting or lasting enough to make a difference on election day.\n\nChen, who was policy director for the 2012 Mitt Romney presidential campaign, cited the example of Romney\u2019s forceful first debate performance against a lacklustre President Barack Obama in 2012. \u201cWe saw a significant bump for Romney in public polling as well as our private polling after that tremendous debate performance against Obama in 2012,\u201d he recalled.\n\n\u201cIn that first debate, he picked up a number of points that was well outside the margin of error in many places. It was a couple of weeks of positive momentum and then the race kind of came back to stasis after that.\u201d\n\nChen added: \u201cThe debate doesn\u2019t just happen in a vacuum. You have the debate but you also have world events and you have what the campaigns do after the debate as well. The debate will have impact but the impact is probably short term and will eventually wash out with other campaign events as they happen.\u201d",

        "text": "Historian who accurately predicted 9 of last 10 presidential elections makes his 2024 pick\nWASHINGTON - Allan Lichtman, the historian who correctly predicted the outcome of 9 out of the 10 most recent presidential elections, has made his guess on who will reclaim the White House this year.\n\nSpoiler alert: it\u2019s Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nLichtman said in a video, first reported by The New York Times, that he based his prediction on thirteen keys or \u201cbig picture true-false questions that tap into the strength and performance of the White House Party.\u201d\n\n7 takeaways from Harris-Trump debate:What was said on abortion, inflation, immigration and other issues Floridians care about\n\nWho is Allan Lichtman?\n\nBefore receiving the title of \"Distinguished Professor\" from the American University in Washington, D.C., Lichtman earned a Ph.D. specializing in modern American history and quantitative methods at Harvard.\n\nIn addition to lecturing in the U.S. and around the world, Lichtman is the author of 13 books and hundreds of academic articles. He has also been an expert witness in civil and voting rights cases.\n\nHe routinely provides political commentary and is best known for his election forecasting.\n\nAllan Lichtman: What are the 13 keys to a successful election campaign?\n\nThe keys include whether:\n\n\u25fe The White House party gained House seats during the midterm elections.\n\n\u25fe The sitting president is running for reelection.\n\n\u25fe The White House party is avoiding a primary contest.\n\n\u25fe There is a third-party challenger.\n\n\u25fe The short-term economy is strong.\n\n\u25fe The long-term economic growth has been as good as the last two terms.\n\n\u25fe The White House party has made major changes to national policy.\n\n\u25fe There is sustained social unrest during the term.\n\n\u25fe The White House is untainted by scandal, the incumbent party is charismatic.\n\n\u25fe The challenger is uncharismatic.\n\n\u25fe The incumbent is charismatic.\n\n\u25fe The White House party has a major failure in foreign policy.\n\n\u25fe The White House party has foreign policy success.\n\nEight of the keys are in favor of Harris, while three are in favor of Trump.\n\n\u201cForeign policy is tricky, and these keys could flip,\u201d he said in the video. \u201cThe Biden administration is deeply invested in the war in Gaza, which is a humanitarian disaster with no end in sight. But even if both foreign policy keys flipped false, that would mean that there were only five negative keys, which would not be enough for Donald Trump to regain the White House.\u201d\n\nThat leaves Harris winning the White House, he said. \u201cAt least that's my prediction for this race, but the outcome is up to you, so get out and vote.\u201d\n\nLichtman has correctly predicted the outcome of almost every election over the last half-century, except for the race in 2000, in which Republican George W. Bush defeated Democrat Al Gore.\n\nContributing: Karissa Waddick",

        "text": "Could the 2024 presidential election hinge on Maine? It\u2019s possible.\nWith less than two months to go before Election Day, political experts and pollsters are closely watching states such as Pennsylvania and Georgia as battlegrounds that could decide the outcome of the presidential election.\n\nBut there is one possible scenario in which Maine also plays a key role.\n\nMore specifically, it\u2019s the voters in the vast, rural 2nd Congressional District that stretches across western, central, northern and Down East Maine who may help pick the next U.S. president.\n\nHere\u2019s how it would work.\n\nPresidents are elected not by national popular vote but by the Electoral College, which apportions votes based on population. There are 538 total electoral votes, and 270 are needed to win.\n\nBased on recent history and current polling, there are 19 states that appear safe for the Democratic ticket, Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. Those states control 225 electoral votes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy contrast, there are 24 states that are reliably Republican and likely to deliver for former President Donald Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio. That\u2019s 219 electoral votes.\n\nThe remaining seven states \u2013 Arizona, Nevada, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Georgia \u2013 have 93 collective electoral votes up for grabs.\n\nHarris is leading in the Midwest states of Wisconsin and Michigan, so those are likely in her corner. There is also a decent chance she can win the Western states of Nevada and Arizona. If those states also go Harris\u2019 way, it would put her total at 267 votes.\n\nTrump, on the other hand, has a slight edge in North Carolina, and if he carries that state along with Georgia and Pennsylvania, he would get to 269 votes, just shy of the total needed for victory.\n\nBut there are still two electoral votes unaccounted for, and this is where Maine comes in.\n\nMaine is one of only two states \u2013 Nebraska is the other \u2013 that apportion electoral votes by congressional district. Each of Maine\u2019s two congressional districts is worth one vote, and the state as a whole is worth another two. Nebraska has three congressional districts, each worth one electoral vote, and the state\u2019s overall winner gets two votes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNebraska is a solidly red state, but its 2nd Congressional District \u2013 made up mostly of the state\u2019s biggest city, Omaha \u2013 leans Democratic. So that one vote is likely to go to Harris/Walz.\n\nMaine, by contrast, is mostly a Democratic state, but its 2nd District has become far more conservative.\n\nDemocrats (Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Joe Biden in 2020) won the state and the 1st Congressional District, but in each election, Trump carried the 2nd District and its lone electoral vote.\n\nSo, if Trump can hold the triumvirate of Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Georgia, that one vote in Maine\u2019s 2nd District could conceivably be the deciding factor in whether he returns to the White House.\n\nThe scenario has been explored by political analysts at CNN and The Washington Post just in the last week.\n\nBut while possible, the path through Maine is not widely seen as very likely \u2013 at least right now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavid Wasserman, an analyst with Cook Political Report, said although Maine has gotten some attention, he doesn\u2019t think its lone vote in the 2nd District will be the decider.\n\n\u201cStates don\u2019t behave independently of each other,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if Trump is winning Pennsylvania and Georgia, odds are he\u2019s winning North Carolina, too, and other states that are demographically quite similar.\u201d\n\nBoth analysts and the presidential campaigns are closely watching state-by-state polling to identify key battlegrounds. Campaigns will move money and staff from state to state as the election draws closer and the pathways to victory become clearer.\n\nThere hasn\u2019t been much polling in Maine this election cycle, so it\u2019s hard to know what the mood is here. And there has been a sizable population increase here since 2020, although most of those new voters live in the 1st Congressional District.\n\nThe University of New Hampshire Survey Center polled 821 Mainers between Aug. 15-19. Harris held a 55-38 advantage statewide and a 49-44 edge in the 2nd District, which was a surprise.\n\nAndrew Smith, a political scientist at UNH who directs the Survey Center, also said he doesn\u2019t think the \u201cMaine scenario\u201d is that likely at the moment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou could certainly put together some collection of states where it happens, but historically that has not been the case,\u201d he said.\n\nThe closest presidential election \u2013 in terms of Electoral College math \u2013 was in 2000, when President George W. Bush defeated Al Gore, 271-266, after the Supreme Court stepped in to settle a contentious recount in Florida.\n\nSmith said there is a strong argument that New Hampshire decided that election. It was the only Northeastern state to vote Republican that year, but if its four electoral votes went to Gore, Florida wouldn\u2019t have mattered.\n\nIn 2016, Trump spent a good bit of time campaigning in Maine. He even talked about how he viewed the state in his electoral chances.\n\n\u201cI went to Maine four times,\u201d he said in an interview with The New York Times after the election. \u201cI went to Maine (2nd District) for one, because everybody was saying, \u2018You can get to 269, but there is no path to 270.\u2019 We learned that was false because we ended up with, what, three-something (electoral votes).\u201d Trump collected 306 Electoral College votes in 2016.\n\nTrump has not campaigned in Maine yet this year, and neither have any big-name surrogates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt could be that Trump sees the 2nd District as a lock. His margin in 2016 was 10 points, although that shrunk to seven in 2020.\n\nInterestingly, there is also a plausible scenario in which Harris reaches exactly 270 electoral votes, but only with the help of that one vote from Nebraska\u2019s 2nd District.\n\nIf she wins Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin and Trump holds North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada, that lone vote in Nebraska would be the difference.\n\nDan Shea, professor of government at Colby College, said Republicans could look to shore up support in Maine\u2019s 2nd District over the next two months while Democrats put resources into Nebraska\u2019s 2nd.\n\n\u201cThere is no question those are the two swing single districts,\u201d he said. \u201cThey could be very important.\u201d\n\nMarc Short, former chief of staff to Vice President Mike Pence, is visiting Colby College next week and was asked about the importance of Maine\u2019s 2nd District.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOur nation is more polarized than in recent years, so I think it is pretty evenly divided, and (the election) will be decided by a couple of states,\u201d he told a Portland Press Herald/Maine Sunday Telegram reporter. \u201cI don\u2019t want to try to handicap whether it comes down to the one seat in Maine or the one seat in Nebraska. But I do think it is reality that our national elections are now fought in a handful of states, and it makes each and every one of those (Electoral College votes) more important, including Maine\u2019s district.\u201d\n\nThis spring, Trump and Republican allies sought to change Nebraska\u2019s law to make the state winner-take-all. That effort failed.\n\nHowever, while that debate was happening in Nebraska, some top Democrats in Maine warned that if Nebraska were going to make a change to effectively shift that one electoral vote from Democrats to Republicans, Maine might make a similar change here, which would offset any impact. Maine\u2019s Legislature is controlled by Democrats.\n\n\u201cIf Nebraska\u2019s Republican governor and Republican-controlled Legislature were to change their electoral system this late in the cycle in order to unfairly award Donald Trump an additional electoral vote, I think the Maine Legislature would be compelled to act in order to restore fairness to our country\u2019s electoral system,\u201d House Majority Leader Maureen Terry, a Gorham Democrat, said at the time.\n\nThere is also a chance \u2013 albeit a long shot \u2013 that future elections may not rely as heavily on the electoral vote.\n\nA group of states have joined what\u2019s called the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, which pledges that all of its electoral votes will be awarded to whichever presidential candidate wins the popular vote nationwide, rather than the candidate who won the vote in just that state. Maine joined the compact this spring.\n\nThe compact will only be activated after enough states join to control 270 Electoral College votes, the minimum number needed to win the presidency. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 16 states and the District of Columbia have enacted national popular vote laws and have committed 205 electoral votes so far.\n\nStaff writers Rachel Ohm and Randy Billings contributed to this story.",

With the much-anticipated FOMC meeting in September and the upcoming November elections, attention is focused on the U.S. These events are significant, affecting not only traditional markets but also crypto enthusiasts who are hoping for legislation that could ease regulations in the cryptocurrency space.\n\nThis year has been pivotal for cryptocurrency. Bitcoin has achieved new all-time highs, and the approval of spot Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US represents major progress towards mainstream adoption. These achievements underscore the increasing integration of digital currencies into the global economy, paving the way for greater political and regulatory scrutiny as the election approaches.\n\nAlso Read | How Bitcoin ETFs can send Bitcoin prices to the moon in five years\n\nAccording to experts, the primary effect of crypto ETFs has been the increased legitimacy they bring to the space. However, some users believe their main impact is on market inflows. Regardless, the upcoming US Presidential elections will influence both perspectives. If pro-crypto candidates win, they could act as a significant market driver, with the President\u2019s choice shaping overall market sentiment.\n\n\u201cHistorical evidence going back to 1927 suggests that the incumbent party loses 70% of the time, when elections are held in a recessionary year. Additionally, the incumbent also typically loses when the economy slips into a recession in the 12 months following the election. What is different about this election is that the hot-button topic is not economic growth, which has been robust in recent quarters, but prices and inflation, which have been difficult to control and have had an impact on affordability and disposable income,\u201d said Subho Moulik, Founder & CEO, Appreciate.\n\nImpact on crypto market Avinash Shekhar, CoFounder & CEO, Pi42 believes that US elections are most likely to affect the investor's sentiment, laws governing the crypto, and the progress of digital assets, making the US elections an important event for the crypto market.\n\nAlso Read | Crypto holders more likely to have personality traits of narcissism, psychopathy\n\n\u201cIt is important to realize that the elections will assume paramount importance in shaping the future of digital assets, blockchain solutions, and the overall context of the crypto sphere,\u201d Shekhar said.\n\nSo far the year has already been a landmark year with BTC reaching all time high and the approval of BTC ETFs and ETH ETFs. These milestones are a clear indication of growing interest of users in digital currency whilst setting the stage to seek regulatory attention as the election nears.",

        "text": "Here\u2019s where Trump and Harris stand on 6 education issues\nHere\u2019s where Trump and Harris stand on 6 education issues\n\ntoggle caption LA Johnson/NPR\n\nAs presidential candidates, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump don\u2019t have a lot in common when it comes to their views on education.\n\nTrump has said America\u2019s public schools \u201chave been taken over by the radical Left maniacs,\u201d and that he wants to close the U.S. Department of Education.\n\nHarris has vowed to keep the department open.\n\nDemocrats are for free, universal preschool for all 4-year-olds.\n\nRepublicans are for universal school choice, where parents have the power \u2014 and the public dollars \u2014 to enroll their children in any school they want, whether it\u2019s public or private.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe list goes on.\n\nAhead of the candidates\u2019 only scheduled debate, in Philadelphia on Tuesday, we\u2019ve put together a handy primer of their education views.\n\n\n\n1. On closing the U.S. Department of Education\n\nTrump, in an interview on X , told Elon Musk that, if elected, \u201cI want to close up the Department of Education, move education back to the states.\u201d\n\nHarris didn\u2019t talk much about education in her DNC speech , but she did parry Trump\u2019s plan: \u201cWe are not going to let him eliminate the Department of Education that funds our public schools.\u201d\n\nA quick explanatory comma about that funding: Most public school funding comes from states and local communities. But the department does administer two large funding streams, now more than $30 billion, that Congress codified into law decades ago to help schools educate 1.) children with disabilities and 2.) kids living in low-income communities.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear if Trump\u2019s desire to close the department would also mean disrupting this funding.\n\nProject 2025, a blueprint for the next Republican presidency that included input from Trump loyalists, recommends closing the department, turning both funding streams into no-strings-attached grants and phasing out the low-income support dollars within 10 years.\n\nBut the Trump campaign has disavowed Project 2025. NPR asked the campaign to clarify its position on funding for children with disabilities and kids living in low-income communities, and press secretary Karoline Leavitt responded: \u201cPresident Trump will ensure a great education for every child by returning our education system to the states where it belongs.\u201d\n\nThe Education Department debate isn\u2019t just financial. It\u2019s also symbolic.\n\nTrump and some Republicans believe, fundamentally, that education should only be a local and state concern, as there\u2019s no mention of a federal role in education in the U.S. Constitution. To them the department is the poster child for government overreach, which is why Republicans have been calling for the department\u2019s dissolution ever since it was created in 1979.\n\nWhere Republicans see local control of education as an inherently good thing, allowing schools to better reflect the values of their communities, Harris and many Democrats also see inequity in some districts\u2019 inability (and sometimes unwillingness) to serve marginalized students.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nCongress created those funding streams to help level the playing field and to give the department the ability to hold districts accountable when they fall short on civil rights. Harris has previously backed increasing funding for low-income students and children with disabilities.\n\nDisagreements aside, can the department be shut down?\n\nNot by the president, no. It was created by Congress, and only Congress can close it. Some House Republicans have tried , but there\u2019s simply not enough support, not just among Democrats but Republicans, too. Public surveys show even a majority of Republicans believe the U.S. government should be spending more, not less, on education.\n\nKeep in mind, eight years ago then-presidential candidate Donald Trump suggested he might try to close the Education Department. He then got his chance as president \u2014 with Republican control of Congress \u2014 but never forced the issue.\n\n\n\n2. On sex-based discrimination in schools, aka Title IX\n\nIn April, the Biden-Harris administration expanded protections against sex discrimination in schools to include sexual orientation and gender identity. Meaning, among other things, it believes students should be allowed to use the bathroom that corresponds with their gender identity.\n\nThis is not a change in federal law. That requires Congress. It\u2019s a change in interpretation of the law, known as Title IX, courtesy of new regulations from the U.S. Department of Education.\n\nTrump and many Republicans see this expanded interpretation of Title IX as Democrats imposing liberalism on schools. In a recent call with reporters, representatives of the Trump campaign and the RNC repeatedly derided what they called Harris\u2019 \u201cradical gender ideology.\u201d\n\nIf this sounds all-too-familiar, that\u2019s because this is an old fight. In 2016, the Obama administration issued guidance to schools , telling them that students should be allowed to use the bathroom facilities that correspond with their gender identity.\n\nIn early 2017, the nascent Trump administration quickly moved in the opposite direction, abandoning that interpretation of the law.\n\nProtesting these latest Biden administration provisions, roughly half of all states have sued the department, and the courts have blocked the Education Department from enforcing the regulations in those states. Trump has said, if re-elected, he would roll back the rule, just as he did the old Obama-era guidance.\n\n\n\nSponsor Message\n\n3. On school choice\n\nWe\u2019re using \u201cchoice\u201d here broadly because many of Trump\u2019s education proposals shoot from the same root: That parents should have total or near-total control over their child\u2019s education.\n\nFirst, he\u2019s calling for universal school choice. This would, in theory, take public dollars normally spent on a child\u2019s public education and give them directly to parents to spend at whatever school they want, whether it\u2019s public, private or homeschooling at the kitchen table.\n\nHe has also called for a Parental Bill of Rights and for school principals to be hired \u2014 and fired \u2014 by parents. \u201cIf any principal is not getting the job done, the parents should be able to vote to fire them and select someone who will. This will be the ultimate form of local control,\u201d Trump said in July.\n\nTrump also wants to make it easier to fire \u201cbad\u201d teachers, by ending tenure protections, and to reward strong teachers with merit pay. \u201cIf we have pink-haired Communists teaching our kids, we have a major problem. When I am president, we will put PARENTS back in charge and give them the final say,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to imagine how a second Trump administration could implement these ideas around school choice or principal and teacher retention, though, as the U.S. government has limited power to influence state and school district policy.\n\nDemocrats, on the other hand, made clear in their 2024 platform that they\u2019re against any effort that could weaken the nation\u2019s public schools. \u201cWe oppose the use of private-school vouchers, tuition tax credits, opportunity scholarships, and other schemes that divert taxpayer-funded resources away from public education. Public tax dollars should never be used to discriminate.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s likely a reference to the fact that, in some state voucher programs, a private school is allowed to reject children with disabilities if it doesn\u2019t believe it has the staff or resources to meet their needs. Federal law requires that schools that receive federal funding provide kids with disabilities a free and appropriate public education.\n\nIn a letter to Harris , some two-dozen grassroots education groups urged her not to choose Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro to be her running mate, because of his previous support for private-school vouchers . She ultimately chose Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a former public school teacher and coach.\n\nHarris has been an outspoken supporter of public education and has been courting educators\u2019 support. In a speech to the American Federation of Teachers, she told the crowd, \u201cWe need you so desperately right now,\u201d and called it \u201cthe most noble of work, teaching other people\u2019s children.\u201d\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAs part of her presidential bid in 2019, Harris proposed a $300 billion plan to raise teacher pay. Though she has not revived the plan, she did tell the AFT, \u201cGod knows we don\u2019t pay you enough.\u201d\n\n\n\n4. On early childhood education and support\n\nHarris and Democrats have talked as much, if not more, about early childhood education and childcare than they have about K-12 policies. Harris has proposed expanding the Child Tax Credit after a brief, pandemic-era expansion dramatically cut child poverty , and she pitched an even larger boost of up to $6,000 for newborns.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 2024 platform also includes support for free, universal preschool for 4-year-olds, something the Biden-Harris administration had previously championed but was forced to abandon in negotiations with Congress.\n\nFinally, there\u2019s Head Start, the federally-funded program that provides child care and early learning for children from low-income families. The Biden-Harris administration has been a staunch supporter of Head Start, which serves children from birth to age 5. In her DNC speech , Harris promised not to let Trump \u201cend programs like Head Start that provide preschool and child care.\u201d\n\nHarris was likely referring, again, to Project 2025 , which alleges Head Start is \u201cfraught with scandal and abuse\u201d and recommends eliminating it entirely. Congressional funding for Head Start rose during the Trump administration, in spite of the White House calling for modest cuts .\n\nNPR asked the Trump campaign to clarify its position on Head Start funding. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt responded: \u201cBy returning our education system back to the states, our early childhood education system will thrive because parents will have more say in their child\u2019s education and good teachers will be rewarded.\u201d\n\n\n\n5. On banning books and \u201cdivisive concepts\u201d\n\nBetween July and December 2023, PEN America recorded more than 4,300 instances of school book bans, a big uptick from the previous year.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nOf the books that were targeted in the 2021-\u201922 and \u201822-\u201923 school years, the nonprofit found that 37% grappled with race and racism and included characters of color, and 36% included LGBTQ+ characters and themes.\n\nTrump has been an unabashed champion of efforts to limit how schools approach issues of race and gender. In 2020, he created the 1776 Commission , which lamented that \u201cmany students are now taught in school to hate their own country, and to believe that the men and women who built it were not heroes, but rather villains.\u201d\n\nSince then, some states have passed laws curtailing what teachers can and cannot say in the classroom when it comes to matters of race and gender. And in July, as part of his Plan To Save American Education , Trump pledged to \u201ccut federal funding for any school or program pushing Critical Race Theory, gender ideology, or other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content,\u201d though it\u2019s not clear how or if he could do that.\n\nKamala Harris used her speech before the American Federation of Teachers to blast Trump.\n\n\u201cWhile you teach students about our nation\u2019s past,\u201d she told the crowd of teachers, \u201cthese extremists attack the freedom to learn and acknowledge our nation\u2019s true and full history, including book bans. Book bans in this year of our Lord 2024.\u201d\n\n\n\n6. On college affordability\n\nThe Biden-Harris administration went all-in on federal student loan forgiveness. Some of its plans worked , but the administration has so far failed to convince the courts that its most ambitious efforts at loan forgiveness are legal.\n\nThat may explain why, on the campaign trail, Harris isn\u2019t talking much about future loan forgiveness, or making new promises. Instead, she\u2019s largely backward-looking.\n\n\u201cOur administration has forgiven student loan debt for nearly 5 million Americans,\u201d Harris told the American Federation of Teachers gathering, emphasizing that many of those Americans are teachers who received Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF).\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAs a senator and vice president, Harris has also supported efforts to make community college free, a commitment echoed in the 2024 Democratic party platform .\n\nAs for Trump, as president he previously tried to eliminate PSLF , and he and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, have both spoken out against broad loan forgiveness.\n\nIn 2023, after the Supreme Court blocked Biden\u2019s first big effort, Trump celebrated : \u201cPresident Biden is not allowed to wipe out hundreds and hundreds of billions, probably trillions, of dollars in student loan debt, which would have been very unfair to the millions and millions of people who have paid their debt through hard work and diligence.\u201d\n\nThe 2024 Republican party platform pledges , \u201cto reduce the cost of Higher Education, Republicans will support the creation of additional, drastically more affordable alternatives to a traditional four-year College degree.\u201d\n\nLast year, Trump unveiled plans for an online college alternative he\u2019s calling The American Academy: \u201cWe will take the billions and billions of dollars that we will collect by taxing, fining, and suing excessively large private university endowments, and we will then use that money to endow a new institution\u2026 Its mission will be to make a truly world-class education available to every American, free of charge, and do it without adding a single dime to the federal debt.\u201d",

        "text": "2. Issues and the 2024 election\nAs concerns around the state of the economy and inflation continue, about eight-in-ten registered voters (81%) say the economy will be very important to their vote in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nWhile the economy is the top issue among voters, a large majority (69%) cite at least five of the 10 issues asked about in the survey as very important to their vote.\n\nThere are wide differences between voters who support Harris and Trump when it comes to the issues.\n\nAmong Trump supporters, the economy (93%), immigration (82%) and violent crime (76%) are the leading issues. Just 18% of Trump supporters say racial and ethnic inequality is very important. And even fewer say climate change is very important (11%).\n\nFor Harris supporters, issues such as health care (76%) and Supreme Court appointments (73%) are of top importance. Large majorities also cite the economy (68%) and abortion (67%) as very important to their vote in the election.\n\nMost voters cite several issues as very important to their vote\n\nMost voters cite several issues as very important to their vote this November. Very few \u2013 just 5% \u2013 say only one issue or no issues are highly important.\n\nMajorities of both Harris supporters (71%) and Trump supporters (69%) say at least five of 10 issues included in the survey are very important to their vote.\n\nHarris supporters are more likely than Trump supporters to say most of the issues included are very important. About a third of Harris supporters (32%) say at least eight of 10 issues are very important, compared with 17% of Trump supporters.\n\nTop voting issues: 2020 versus 2024\n\nWhile the economy has long been a top issue for voters \u2013 and continues to be one today \u2013 other issues have become increasingly important for voters over the past four years.\n\nImmigration\n\nAbout six-in-ten voters (61%) today say immigration is very important to their vote \u2013 a 9 percentage point increase from the 2020 presidential election and 13 points higher than during the 2022 congressional elections.\n\nImmigration is now a much more important issue for Republican voters in particular: 82% of Trump supporters say it is very important to their vote in the 2024 election, up 21 points from 2020.\n\nAbout four-in-ten Harris supporters (39%) say immigration is very important to their vote. This is 8 points higher than the share of Democratic congressional supporters who said this in 2022, but lower than the 46% of Biden supporters who cited immigration as very important four years ago.\n\nAbortion\n\nIn August 2020, fewer than half of voters (40%) said abortion was a very important issue to their vote. At the time, Trump voters (46%) were more likely than Biden voters (35%) to say it mattered a great deal.\n\nFollowing the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, opinions about abortion\u2019s importance as a voting issue shifted. Today, 67% of Harris supporters call the issue very important \u2013 nearly double the share of Biden voters who said this four years ago, though somewhat lower than the share of midterm Democratic voters who said this in 2022 (74%). And about a third of Trump supporters (35%) now say abortion is very important to their vote \u2013 11 points lower than in 2020.\n\nConfidence in Harris and Trump on top issues\n\nVoters have more confidence in Trump than Harris on economic, immigration and foreign policies. Half or more voters say they are at least somewhat confident in Trump to make good decisions in these areas, while smaller shares (45% each) say this about Harris.\n\nIn contrast, voters have more confidence in Harris than Trump to make good decisions about abortion policy and to effectively address issues around race. Just over half of voters have confidence in Harris on these issues, while 44% have confidence in Trump on these issues.\n\nTrump holds a slight edge over Harris for handling law enforcement and criminal justice issues (51% Trump, 47% Harris). Voters are equally confident in Harris and Trump to select good nominees for the Supreme Court (50% each).\n\nFewer than half of voters say they are very or somewhat confident in either candidate to bring the country closer together (41% are confident in Harris, 36% in Trump). And voters express relatively little confidence in Trump (37%) or Harris (32%) to reduce the influence of money in politics.\n\nSince Biden dropped out of the presidential race in July, there has been movement on how confident voters are in the candidates to address issues facing the country.\n\nAbortion policy\n\nIn July, 48% of voters were confident in Biden to make good decisions about abortion policy. Today, 55% of voters are confident in Harris to do the same.\n\nHarris currently has an 11-point advantage over Trump on voters\u2019 confidence to handle abortion policy decisions.\n\nImmigration policy\n\nVoters also express more confidence in Harris to make wise decisions about immigration policy than they did for Biden before he withdrew from the race. Today, 45% are confident in Harris on this issue; in July, 35% said this about Biden.\n\nWhile Trump\u2019s advantage over Harris on immigration policy is less pronounced than it was over Biden, he continues to hold a 7-point edge. Voters are as confident in his ability to make wise decisions about immigration policy as they were in July (52%).\n\nForeign and economic policies\n\nHarris has also improved over Biden in voters\u2019 confidence to make good decisions about foreign and economic policies. Currently, 45% of voters are confident in Harris on each of these issues.\n\nIn July, 39% had confidence in Biden to make good foreign policy decisions, while a similar share (40%) had confidence in him on economic policy.\n\nTrump holds an edge over Harris on both of these issues, though both are somewhat narrower than the advantage he had over Biden on these issues in July.",

        "text": "White Protestants and Catholics support Trump, but voters in other U.S. religious groups prefer Harris\nHeading into the fall campaign for president, U.S. religious groups that traditionally have leaned Republican are backing former President Donald Trump by wide margins, while religious groups that traditionally have favored Democratic candidates are mostly supporting Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nThe latest Pew Research Center survey, conducted Aug. 26-Sept. 2, 2024, finds that majorities of registered voters in three key religious groups say they would vote for Trump or lean toward doing so if the election were today:\n\n82% of White evangelical Protestants\n\n61% of White Catholics\n\n58% of White nonevangelical Protestants\n\nHarris currently has the backing of roughly two-thirds or more registered voters in various other religious groups:\n\n86% of Black Protestants\n\n85% of atheists\n\n78% of agnostics\n\n65% of Hispanic Catholics\n\n65% of Jewish voters\n\nThe survey includes responses from Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus and people from many other religious backgrounds. However, it does not include enough respondents from these smaller religious groups to be able to report on them separately.\n\nHow we did this Pew Research Center conducted this analysis to understand religious differences in U.S. voters\u2019 views of the 2024 presidential election campaign. For this analysis, we surveyed 9,720 adults \u2013 including 8,044 registered voters \u2013 from Aug. 26 to Sept. 2, 2024. Everyone who took part in this survey is a member of the Center\u2019s American Trends Panel (ATP), a group of people recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses who have agreed to take surveys regularly. This kind of recruitment gives nearly all U.S. adults a chance of selection. Surveys were conducted either online or by telephone with a live interviewer. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other factors. Read more about the ATP\u2019s methodology. Here are the questions used for this analysis, the topline and the survey methodology. Here are details about sample sizes and margins of error for groups analyzed in this analysis.\n\nHarris has improved on Biden\u2019s performance with some religious groups\n\nThe new survey marks the first time that the Center has asked about voters\u2019 preferences between Trump and Harris \u2013 without asking about any third-party candidates \u2013 since President Joe Biden withdrew as the Democratic nominee and independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr. suspended his campaign.\n\nHarris currently garners more support from Black Protestants and Hispanic Catholics than Biden did in April, when 77% of Black Protestants and 49% of Hispanic Catholics backed him.\n\nOtherwise, the religious dynamics of the U.S. presidential campaign look about as they did in the spring.\n\nSupport for Trump varies by church attendance\n\nAmong White evangelicals, support for Trump is higher among those who attend church regularly \u2013 that is, at least once or twice a month \u2013 than among those who don\u2019t. Support for Trump is also marginally higher among White Catholics who attend Mass at least monthly than among White Catholics who attend Mass less often.\n\nBy contrast, among White Protestants who are not evangelical, support for Trump is somewhat lower among regular churchgoers than among those who don\u2019t attend church regularly.\n\nThere are no such differences in support for Harris among Black Protestants: 86% of both regular churchgoers and those who don\u2019t often go to church support her.\n\nHow U.S. religious groups view key issues in the election\n\nWe also asked respondents how important a variety of issues will be to their vote in the presidential election.\n\nCertain issues are highly important to voters regardless of religious group. For instance, at least six-in-ten registered voters in every religious group say the economy will be very important in their voting decision. And half or more in almost every religious group say the same about health care, Supreme Court appointments and foreign policy.\n\nWhite evangelical Protestant voters stand out for the high level of importance they attach to immigration. Roughly eight-in-ten White evangelicals (79%) say immigration will be very important in their voting decision \u2013 higher than any other group. A large majority of White Catholics (72%) also say immigration will be a key factor in their decision.\n\nAbortion, in turn, is rated as a very important issue by more atheists (a group that mostly supports legal abortion) than by people with other religious identities. Roughly three-quarters of atheists (77%) say abortion will be very important in deciding who to vote for. Around six-in-ten agnostics (62%), Jewish voters (59%) and Black Protestants (57%) also say abortion will be very important in deciding how to vote this fall. Fewer Catholics (44%) and White Protestants (including 48% of evangelicals and 43% of nonevangelicals) say the same.\n\nThese differences across religious groups reflect broader partisan patterns. White evangelicals and White Catholics mostly identify with or lean toward the Republican Party and support Trump in the current election. And the new survey shows that more Republican voters than Democratic voters say immigration will be very important to their choice this fall.\n\nOn the other hand, most atheists, agnostics, Black Protestants and Jewish voters identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party and support Harris in the current campaign. The new survey shows that abortion is a key issue for more Democratic voters than Republican voters.\n\nNote: Here are the questions used for this analysis, the topline and the survey methodology. Here are details about sample sizes and margins of error for groups analyzed in this analysis.",

        "text": "Harris and Trump debate in Philadelphia tonight. Here\u2019s what you need to know\nHarris and Trump debate in Philadelphia tonight. Here\u2019s what you need to know\n\ntoggle caption Grace Widyatmadja/NPR; Stephen Maturen/Getty Images\n\nVice President Harris will face off against former President Donald Trump Tuesday for the first time since becoming the Democratic nominee.\n\nThe playing field is different than it was two months ago when President Biden\u2019s dismal debate performance spurred a wave of concern over his ability to defeat Trump, the Republican nominee.\n\nSince then, a lot has happened. Trump survived an assassination attempt, he accepted the GOP presidential nomination, Biden dropped out of the race and Harris then took over and clinched the Democratic party\u2019s nomination.\n\nHarris has since made up the ground Biden lost in swing state polls and now stands virtually tied with Trump. Despite a groundswell of support and reportedly record-breaking fundraising amounts, her campaign\u2019s honeymoon phase is likely to end, especially as Trump and Republicans look to ramp up attacks.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about this second debate of the 2024 presidential election cycle.\n\n\n\nWhen and how to watch\n\nThe event will air at 9 p.m. ET for 90 minutes from the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia. ABC News anchors David Muir and Linsey Davis are slated to moderate the debate, which will be broadcast by the network and streamed on ABC News Live, Disney+ and Hulu.\n\nFollow NPR's live blog for the latest updates, analysis, fact-checking and color; listen to NPR\u2019s special coverage of the ABC News Presidential Debate Simulcast on many public radio stations.\n\n\n\nWhat are the rules for the debate?\n\nThe debate rules echo those agreed on for the June matchup. That means microphones will once again be muted unless a candidate is speaking, something the Harris team asked to change for this debate.\n\nIt\u2019s a rule initially proposed by the Biden campaign ahead of the first debate and was largely seen as a potential shake-up to Trump\u2019s typical debate style. Instead, it ended up benefiting the former president, who has a history of interrupting in these settings to the point of his campaign\u2019s detriment. Instead, the technical change helped Trump appear more controlled.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nHarris\u2019 campaign told ABC that Harris would be disadvantaged by the muted mics because it would shield Trump from direct exchanges \u2014 but said that it would agree to the terms lest Trump drop out of the debate altogether.\n\nA campaign official, speaking on condition of anonymity to describe private negotiations, said that a pool would be on hand to hear what the candidates are saying into muted microphones \u2014 and that if there is \u201csignificant crosstalk,\u201d the network may unmute both microphones. The moderator will warn candidates to stop frequent interruptions, the official said. \u201cOur understanding of these things helped inform our decision to accept muted mics,\u201d the official said.\n\nThere will be no audience and candidates will not be permitted to question each other directly. In addition, neither will be allowed to bring pre-written notes or props onto the debate stage.\n\n\n\nWhat to watch for\n\nHarris has mostly campaigned from the trail in her brief time as a presidential contender \u2014 excluding a single sit-down interview with CNN at the end of August. She has also struggled in the past with unscripted moments as vice president, which will put the spotlight on her ability to perform in a debate while also laying out some of her platform and going on the offensive against Trump.\n\nHarris has been putting an emphasis on protecting reproductive rights while campaigning, and she\u2019s likely to address it Tuesday night. Leading up to the debate, the Harris-Walz campaign launched its \u201cFighting for Reproductive Freedom\u201d bus tour, pledging to make 50 stops in key states around the issues of abortion, IVF and reproductive rights.\n\nTrump\u2019s stance on this issue has been muddy. He\u2019s made comments on abortion that appear to clash with some of his past views and statements while president. Recently, he acknowledged that Florida\u2019s six-week ban was too restrictive, then clarified shortly after that he would not support the state\u2019s upcoming ballot measure that, if passed, would safeguard access to abortions up until fetal viability.\n\nTrump is likely to link Harris to Biden\u2019s handling of the economy and immigration, two areas where Republicans have heavily criticized the White House. He may also highlight aspects of her political record, including her past support for decriminalizing border crossings and banning fracking \u2014 two policies she backed during her 2020 presidential bid and has since pivoted on.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nOn the other hand, Harris has repeatedly tied Trump\u2019s platform to Project 2025, a 900-page set of policy proposals for a potential second term put forward by a conservative think tank, The Heritage Foundation. Trump has tried to distance himself from the plan \u2014 which includes further restrictions on abortion access among a slew of moves that would increase executive power.\n\nTuesday\u2019s matchup also poses new stakes for Trump: He\u2019s facing a very different opponent.\n\nIn the aftermath of the June debate, the former president\u2019s mistakes weren\u2019t a focus, largely because of Biden\u2019s more noticeably poor performance. That said, Trump by no means had a perfect night, repeatedly highlighting false and misleading information. So this time, as NPR\u2019s Domenico Montanaro pointed out, \u201cIf Harris has a solid debate, the focus could be on Trump in a way he doesn\u2019t want.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhat's next?\n\nVice presidential candidates Minnesota Democratic Gov. Tim Walz and Ohio Republican Sen. JD Vance will face off on Oct. 1 in a debate hosted by CBS News. The two hold similar roles in their respective campaigns: to appeal to voters in the \"Blue Wall\" states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin this fall.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether Harris and Trump will debate a second time. No additional dates have been formally announced.\n\nNPR White House Correspondent Tamara Keith contributed reporting.",

        "text": "Trump-Harris first presidential debate: What to watch for\nThe candidates will go head-to-head for the first and perhaps only time before voters head to the polls in November.\n\nFormer United States President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are preparing to face-off in their first presidential debate, with the election less than two months away.\n\nTuesday\u2019s debate will be the first time Trump and Harris \u2014 the candidates for the Republican and Democratic parties, respectively \u2014 will share a stage. The two have never met in person.\n\nThe debate is also set to be a reflection of how dramatically the race has shifted in recent months.\n\nTrump was originally expected to face President Joe Biden at Tuesday\u2019s event. But after an initial debate in June, Biden quit the race amid pressure over his stumbling performance and advanced age.\n\nThe Democratic Party has since rallied around Harris, naming her its nominee for the presidency.\n\nThat change has galvanised Democratic voters and led to a significant improvement in national and state-level polls. Meanwhile, the Trump campaign has struggled to respond to the opposition\u2019s newfound enthusiasm.\n\nWith Harris on the upswing and Trump looking for a way to blunt her momentum, the debate could be their only direct encounter ahead of the vote on November 5.\n\nWhat will Tuesday\u2019s debate look like? What issues will be discussed? And what effect could the debate have on the race, with voting just on the horizon?\n\nWhat time and where is the debate?\n\nThe debate will take place at 9pm US Eastern Time on September 10 (01:00 GMT on Wednesday) at the National Constitution Center (NCC) in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It is set to last 90 minutes.\n\nThe NCC is a nonprofit organisation that houses a museum and promotes education about the US Constitution.\n\nIt has served as a venue for national political events in the past, including a Democratic presidential primary debate in 2008 and two ABC News town halls ahead of the 2020 election.\n\nHow to watch the debate?\n\nThe debate is being hosted by ABC News in collaboration with its local affiliate, WPVI-TV/6ABC.\n\nThe debate will air on ABC and be available to stream on platforms such as ABC News Live, Disney+ and Hulu.\n\nWho will moderate the debate?\n\nABC\u2019s World News Tonight host David Muir and ABC News Live Prime anchor Linsey Davis will serve as moderators.\n\nMuir had moderated a Republican primary debate in February 2016, featuring then-candidate Trump in his first successful run for office. He and Davis also co-helmed the Democratic primary debates in September 2019 and February 2020.\n\nWhat is at stake in the debate?\n\nWith Biden\u2019s decision to end his campaign upending the dynamics of the race, Harris and Trump will use the debate to build momentum as the campaign enters its final stretch.\n\nHarris, in particular, has a relatively short time to pitch herself to voters before the vote as she replaced Biden in the race on July 21, a mere seven weeks ago.\n\nBut the upheaval has been to her advantage as the Democrats have seen a substantial swing in their favour.\n\nAccording to national polling averages by Real Clear Politics, Democrats have gone from trailing Trump by 3.1 percent nationally to leading by 1.8 points in the weeks since Harris\u2019s entry into the race. That is a nearly five-point improvement in just over a month.\n\nBut Marc Trussler, director of data sciences at the Penn Program on Opinion Research and Election Studies at the University of Pennsylvania, said despite the impressive shift, Harris remains neck and neck with Trump.\n\n\u201cAfter a remarkable period with a lot of unprecedented events, we\u2019ve ended up in a place that feels pretty familiar, with the Democratic nominee holding a slight advantage in a tight race that will come down to tens of thousands of voters in a handful of swing states,\u201d Trussler said.\n\nIn fact, a national poll by The New York Times and Sienna College released on Sunday showed Trump and Harris in practically a dead heat, with the former president marginally ahead. The poll also suggests that the momentum that Harris gathered over the past month might have somewhat stalled.\n\nWhile presidential debates do not decide elections on their own, the narrow margin of this year\u2019s race means that every success or slip-up can come with consequences.\n\n\u201cUsually, we would say these debates don\u2019t have much of an impact because the people who tune in tend to be those who have already made up their mind,\u201d said Trussler. \u201cBut this is going to be a very close election, so anything that has the potential to move the needle even a little comes with high stakes.\u201d\n\nWhat issues could be discussed?\n\nWhile a list of questions has not been released, a number of issues have dominated the race so far.\n\nThey include the economy, immigration, abortion, Trump\u2019s refusal to acknowledge his loss in the 2020 election and foreign policy, particularly with wars raging in Ukraine and Gaza.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s campaign will hope to emphasise inflation and immigration, where they think Harris is most vulnerable,\u201d said Trussler. \u201cFor the Harris campaign, the emphasis will probably be on Trump\u2019s general fitness for office and abortion.\u201d\n\nWhat rules have been agreed to?\n\nThe rules over the debate have been a point of contention between the two campaigns.\n\nFor the first debate in June, Biden\u2019s camp had asked that the microphones of both candidates be switched off while the other was speaking to avoid interruptions.\n\nBut for Tuesday\u2019s debate, the Harris campaign asked to reverse that stipulation, on the premise that the rule worked to Trump\u2019s advantage.\n\nTrump, after all, is known for outbursts and interruptions during debates, and Harris\u2019s strategists suggested that a muted microphone may make him appear more disciplined than he really is.\n\nBoth campaigns eventually agreed to keep the muted microphones.\n\nOnly Trump and Harris are expected to appear onstage. No audience will be present at the live broadcast, and there will only be two breaks during the debate for commercials.\n\nFor each question they face, the candidates have two minutes to respond. Rebuttals will also be capped at two minutes, with the possibility of an extra minute for a further response.\n\nBoth Harris and Trump will also have two minutes at the end of the night to offer a closing statement.\n\nThird-party candidates in the US are generally considered long shots, and the threshold to qualify for Tuesday\u2019s debate effectively limited their participation.\n\nTo be on stage, participants had to show they had drawn at least 15 percent support in four separate national polls, a bar no third-party candidate has been able to clear.\n\nWill there be more debates after this one?\n\nFor the moment, no additional debates are scheduled. Tuesday\u2019s encounter between Trump and Harris could mark the only time voters have a chance to watch them square off before voting.\n\nWhether Tuesday\u2019s debate would even happen was itself the subject of speculation. Trump previously suggested that he might skip it altogether and accused ABC News of bias.\n\nHe reversed course in a social media post last month, saying he had agreed to the September 10 debate.\n\nBut he included a swipe at the debate host in his message. \u201cABC FAKE NEWS,\u201d he wrote, was \u201cby far the nastiest and most unfair newscaster in the business\u201d.",

        "text": "Harris and Trump tied in latest US election polls, as Tuesday\u2019s debate nears\nDonald Trump and Kamala Harris are in effect tied heading into the final weeks of the election campaign, according to a national poll conducted by the New York Times and Siena College, raising the stakes of Tuesday\u2019s presidential debate.\n\nTrump is up one percentage point, 48%-47%, over Harris, according to the survey released on Sunday, a difference that is within the survey\u2019s three-percentage point margin of error, meaning a win for either candidate in the election on 5 November is well within reach.\n\nSeparately, a CBS/YouGov poll on Sunday showed a similarly tight race in key swing states, with Harris leading narrowly in Michigan (50%-49%) and Wisconsin (51%-49) and tied in Pennsylvania.\n\nWhile the Trump campaign endured a relatively rocky stretch in the weeks after Democratic President Joe Biden dropped out of the race in July, the most recent polling indicates his core support base is not going anywhere.\n\nThe NYT poll notably showed that voters feel they need to learn more about Harris, while their opinions on Trump are largely set. In the survey, 28% of likely voters said they needed more information about the Democratic nominee, while only 9% said the same about Trump.\n\nThe poll indicates that Tuesday\u2019s presidential debate could be a crucial moment.\n\nHarris will have the opportunity to give more detail of her planned policies as she spars with Trump over the course of 90 minutes. The race is so close that even a marginal boost for either candidate would be significant.\n\nIn the wake of the latest polling, Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon, Harris\u2019s re-election campaign chair, said in an email to supporters on Sunday: \u201cAs vice-president Harris has said since day one, we are the underdogs in this race. We have a lot of work to do to make sure we win this November, and that will require us to continue aggressively raising money.\n\n\u201cThe electoral college benefits the Republican ticket. Even in 2020, when the Biden-Harris ticket won more votes than any ticket in history, the election came down to about 45,000 votes across the battleground states. This November, we anticipate margins to be similarly razor-thin. Every single vote will count.\u201d\n\nIn the CBS poll, Harris enjoyed a double-digit lead over Trump when voters were asked who had the mental and cognitive health to serve as president, and 71% did not like Trump\u2019s comments about the vice-president, finding them insulting.\n\nHowever, the economy and inflation were shown to be major factor in voters\u2019 intention to back Trump over Harris. Among white, non-college educated voters, Trump was widely favoured to provide economic opportunities for working-class people (53%-27%).\n\nThe key figures from the latest NYT poll are similar to its last comparable survey, released in late July, just after Biden decided not to seek re-election. In that poll, Trump was also up one percentage point, a difference well within the margin of error.\n\nPolls in the seven key swing states likely to determine the winner of the election have also consistently shown a razor-thin race. In the latest poll, Harris narrowly leads Trump in Wisconsin (50%-47%), Michigan (49%-47%) and Pennsylvania (49%-48%).\n\nA separate NYT/Siena poll focusing only on those key swing states last month showed Harris leading Trump by four percentage points, 50% to 46%.\n\nSince Harris replaced Biden atop the Democratic ticket over the summer, she has hit the campaign trail hard, but has limited her unscripted appearances and kept interviews with the news media to a minimum.\n\nWith Reuters",

        "text": "International students share diverse views on 2024 US elections\nInternational students in the United States are observing the 2024 presidential election with a mix of curiosity and concern, highlighting the global interest of American politics in the rest of the world.\n\nWhen speaking with some current and former international students who have witnessed several U.S. presidential election campaigns, they were drawn to the openness of discussions and the amount of information available about the process.\n\nThey appreciate the high level of engagement and transparency in the electoral process, which stands in stark contrast to the more restricted political environments in their home countries. Their diverse feedback highlights the global interest in and impact of American politics.\n\nMusbah Shaheen, a native of Syria, arrived in the U.S. in 2014 for undergraduate studies at Vanderbilt University. Now an assistant professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, Shaheen said he initially found the political landscape confusing.\n\n\u201cThe first U.S. election I experienced was in 2016. At the time, I didn\u2019t even realize I was experiencing an election in the same way I did in 2020,\u201d he said. \u201cMy interaction with the political system in the [United] States has been an eye-opening experience.\u201d\n\nIn Syria, political discussions were often avoided, he said, adding that, \u201cPolitics was taboo. Family gatherings involved hushed conversations with windows closed and voices lowered.\u201d\n\nThis contrasted sharply with the open political discourse he encountered in the U.S.\n\n\u201cIn the United States, people sometimes feel like their voice doesn\u2019t matter, but I have experienced actual fear of vocalizing what I believed. This country does feel like there is room for conversation and debate in a way that I didn\u2019t really get when I was in Syria,\u201d Shaheen said.\n\nNow a faculty member, Shaheen emphasizes guiding students through ideological differences.\n\n\u201cI want my students to understand not just the policies but the ideologies behind them,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat does it mean to be conservative or liberal? What are the foundational beliefs of these ideologies?\u201d\n\nShaheen emphasized the need to create both physical and emotional spaces where students can freely discuss topics like U.S. politics. Moreover, Shaheen calls for increased intellectual engagement.\n\n\u201cWe need to encourage all students, international and domestic, to reflect on their beliefs and engage in meaningful conversations. We don\u2019t want siloed resources for our students; we want them to engage with a variety of ideas,\u201d he explained.\n\nRohan Naval, from Bengaluru, India, and a political science student at American University in Washington, offers a different perspective.\n\nNaval, who has been studying in the U.S. for a year, mentioned being impressed by the extensive media coverage of U.S. elections.\n\n\u201cFrom a student\u2019s perspective, I like the way U.S. elections are conducted. There\u2019s a lot of media coverage, and efforts to get voters registered and informed are commendable,\u201d he said.\n\nNaval expressed surprise at the unpredictability of the current U.S. campaign.\n\n\u201cEverything we\u2019ve seen over the last two months has been very surprising, like the assassination attempt on Donald Trump. It\u2019s hard to predict what will happen next,\u201d he said.\n\nHe was particularly surprised by President Joe Biden\u2019s decision to drop out of the race after participating in just one debate.\n\nNaval, who grew up in India, compared U.S. and Indian elections, noting the convenience of mail-in ballots in the U.S. and the transparency in the counting process.\n\n\u201cIn India, voters often have to travel long distances to cast their ballots, whereas in the U.S., the process is more accessible,\u201d he said.\n\nVictoria Charalampidi, a recent graduate from the American College of Greece where she majored in communication with a minor in international affairs, had studied in the U.S. in 2022 at Loyola University in Baltimore, Maryland.\n\n\u201cWhen I arrived, Joe Biden was president. I viewed his presidency as a shift away from Trump\u2019s administration,\u201d she said.\n\nShe noted that Trump\u2019s economic policies had some positive effects, but she thought his approach to politics was often more divisive compared to Biden's approach during his candidacy.\n\nCharalampidi said she found the complexity of governing a diverse nation intriguing.\n\nShe said she is disappointed with the current political campaigns in the U.S., which she said seems more polarized.\n\n\u201cThe focus on military engagements and the rollback of policies like abortion rights show a country struggling to move forward while clinging to old values,\u201d Charalampidi said.\n\nShe also says the campaign of Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, represents progress as a woman of color is competing for high office.\n\nAs international students navigate the complexities of U.S. elections, their insights offer a valuable perspective on the global impact of American politics.",

        "text": "September 8, 2024, presidential campaign news\nRepublican presidential nominee and former President Donald Trump holds a rally in Mosinee, Wisconsin, on September 7. Brian Snyder/Reuters\n\nFormer President Donald Trump touched on familiar talking points as he spoke during a campaign rally at an airfield in central Wisconsin on Saturday, projecting confidence about Tuesday\u2019s debate against Vice President Kamala Harris while shouting out allies Elon Musk and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nHere\u2019s some of what Trump said during the rally:\n\nChanging the 25th Amendment: Trump called for modifying the 25th Amendment of the US Constitution and said if a vice president covers for the \u201cincapacity of the president\u201d they should be removed from office.\n\nIt was part of an attack on Harris, who he accuses of a \u201ccover-up\u201d of President Joe Biden\u2019s fitness for office before he eventually dropped out of the race.\n\nOn the debate: Trump said the country is run by \u201cstupid people\u201d and that we \u201cfound that out at the debate with Joe (Biden).\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to find it out again on Tuesday night. Is anybody going to be watching?\u201d Trump asked the crowd. The former president predicted that pundits would say he lost the debate, even \u201cif I destroy her.\u201d\n\nPraising RFK Jr.: Trump repeatedly praised Kennedy, saying that with his help, \u201cwe\u2019ll take on the corruption at the FDA, the CDC, World Health Organization and other institutions of public health.\u201d\n\nKennedy, the former independent presidential candidate who has embraced conspiracy theories about vaccines and other issues, has been positioned by the former president to helm a panel investigating chronic health problems in a potential second Trump administration.\n\nOn Boeing and SpaceX: Trump said the Boeing Starliner crew being stuck in space is \u201cembarrassing,\u201d and that Musk, the SpaceX CEO, is \u201cgoing to have to save them.\u201d\n\nTrump continued his public praise of the tech billionaire amid the tightening alliance between the two men.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s very good at what he does,\u201d Trump said of Musk. \u201cLeon\u2019s going to send up a rocket, he looks forward to it,\u201d he added, apparently misstating his ally\u2019s first name.\n\nThe praise of Musk comes days after Trump announced he would appoint Musk to head a newly created government efficiency commission if reelected.",

        "text": "Data indicates voting by noncitizens is rare. Republicans are pressing measures to make sure of it\nOnly U.S. citizens are eligible to vote in this fall\u2019s election for president and other top offices. While that\u2019s nothing new, the potential for noncitizens to register or vote has been receiving a lot of attention lately.\n\nCiting an influx of immigrants in recent years at the U.S.-Mexico border, Republicans have raised concerns about the possibility that noncitizens will be voting \u2014 something that has rarely occurred in the past. In Congress, House Speaker Mike Johnson is seeking to link an extension of federal government spending authority to a proposal requiring states to obtain proof of citizenship when registering people to vote.\n\nIn various states, GOP officials have launched reviews of voter rolls, issued executive orders and placed constitutional amendments on state ballots as part of an emphasis on thwarting noncitizen voting. Some Democrats contend the measures could create hurdles for legal voters, are unnecessary and lead people to believe the problem of noncitizens voting is bigger than it really is.\n\nWhat to know about Trump\u2019s second term:\n\nStaffing the administration: Here are the people Trump has picked recess appointments Follow all of our coverage as Donald Trump assembles his second administration.\n\nWhat does the law say?\n\nA 1996 U.S. law makes it illegal for noncitizens to vote in elections for president or members of Congress. Violators can be fined and imprisoned for up to a year. They can also be deported.\n\nWhen people register to vote, they confirm under penalty of perjury that they are U.S. citizens. Federal law requires states to regularly maintain their voter rolls and remove anyone who is ineligible, a process that could identify immigrants living in the country illegally.\n\nNo state constitutions explicitly allow noncitizens to vote, and many states have laws that prohibit noncitizens from voting for state offices such as governor or attorney general. But some municipalities in California, Maryland and Vermont, as well as the District of Columbia, do allow voting by noncitizens in some local elections such as for school board and city council.\n\nWhat is Congress doing?\n\nCongress needs to approve a stopgap spending bill before the Sept. 30 end of the budget year to avoid a government shutdown. At the urging of some Republicans, Johnson is seeking to combine a six-month extension of government spending with a measure requiring proof of citizenship, such as birth certificate or passport, to register to vote.\n\nJohnson said Congress has a responsibility to \u201censure that only American citizens can decide American elections.\u201d\n\nThe plan is similar to a bill Republicans pushed earlier this year known as the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act. That legislation passed the Republican-led House in July largely along partisan lines but has not come to a vote in the Democratic-led Senate.\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Monday that he opposes the latest Republican attempt to require proof of citizenship for voter registration. He said the stopgap spending bill should be free of \u201cpartisan policy changes.\u201d\n\nThe Biden administration also has opposed the Republican efforts while asserting that existing laws against noncitizen voting are working.\n\nWhat does the data say?\n\nData from states indicates that voting by noncitizens is rare, But Republican officials have highlighted voter registration reviews that turned up potential noncitizens.\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, said last month that more than 6,500 potential noncitizens have been removed from Texas voter rolls since 2021, including 1,930 with \u201ca voter history\u201d who have been referred for investigation by the attorney general\u2019s office. Texas has almost 18 million registered voters.\n\nOhio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Republican, said in August that he referred for potential prosecution 138 apparent noncitizens found to have voted in a recent election and 459 more who registered but did not vote. Those figures were higher than reviews from previous years but a small fraction of the more than 8 million registered voters in Ohio.\n\nAlabama Secretary of State Wes Allen, a Republican, recently announced that 3,251 people previously identified as noncitizens by the federal government are being switched to inactive status on the state\u2019s voter registration rolls. They will be required to provide proof of citizenship and fill out a form to vote this fall. Alabama has more than 3 million registered voters.\n\nIn Georgia, Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger found that 1,634 potential noncitizens tried to register to vote between 1997 and 2022, though election officials flagged them and none was registered. Georgia registered millions of other voters during that time.\n\nSome election administration experts have said the voter roll reviews show that current tools to flag noncitizen voters are working.\n\nWhat do the courts say?\n\nArizona provides a case study for the long-running attempts by Republicans to prohibit noncitizen voting.\n\nUnder a 2004 voter-approved initiative, Arizona required a driver\u2019s license, birth certificate, passport or other similar document to approve a federal voter registration application. But the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2013 that Arizona cannot require documentary proof of citizenship for people to vote in federal elections.\n\nThe state responded by creating two classes of voters. For state and local elections, voters must provide proof of citizenship when they register or have it on file with the state. But because that cannot be required in presidential and congressional elections, tens of thousands of voters who have not provided proof of citizenship are registered only for federal elections.\n\nAn August order by a divided U.S. Supreme Court will allow voter registration forms submitted without \u201cdocumentary proof of citizenship\u201d to be rejected by Arizona counties while litigation over the law continues. People will be able to register to vote in presidential and congressional elections using a different federal form that requires people to swear they are citizens under penalty of perjury, without requiring proof.\n\nWhat\u2019s on the ballot?\n\nRepublican-led legislatures in eight states have proposed constitutional amendments on their November ballots declaring that only citizens can vote.\n\nProposals in Iowa, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Wisconsin would replace existing constitutional provisions stating that \u201cevery\u201d citizen or \u201call\u201d citizens can vote with new wording saying \u201conly\u201d citizens can vote. Supporters contend the current wording does not necessarily bar noncitizens from voting.\n\nIn Idaho and Kentucky, the proposed amendments would explicitly state: \u201cNo person who is not a citizen of the United States\u201d can vote. Similar wording won approval from Louisiana voters two years ago.\n\nVoters in North Dakota, Colorado, Alabama, Florida and Ohio passed amendments between 2018 and 2022 restricting voting to \u201conly\u201d citizens.\n\nWhat else are states doing?\n\nAlthough noncitizen voting already is prohibited in the state constitution, Republican Gov. Jeff Landry of Louisiana is continuing to draw attention to the issue. He recently signed an executive order requiring state agencies that provide voter registration forms to include a written disclaimer that noncitizens are prohibited from voting.\n\nIn Georgia, Raffensperger is requiring every polling place to post a sign in English and Spanish warning noncitizens that it is illegal to vote.\n\nRepublican Attorney General Ken Paxton of Texas, citing \u201csignificant growth of the noncitizen population\u201d in the state, set up a special email account to report suspected violations of election laws.\n\nIn Wisconsin, Republicans have filed a pair of similar lawsuits in recent weeks that challenge the state\u2019s process for verifying whether a registered voter is a citizen. The lawsuits seek court orders requiring the elections commission to perform checks to ensure there are no registered voters who are noncitizens.\n\nNorth Carolina Republicans have sued the state election board, alleging it is not enforcing a new law aimed at removing people from voter rolls who seek jury duty exclusions because they are not citizens.\n\nTennessee\u2019s top election office sent letters in June asking for proof of citizenship from more than 14,000 registered voters, though those who failed to respond won\u2019t be barred from voting. The list was based on data from the state Department of Safety and Homeland Security, which has information about whether residents were U.S. citizens when they first interacted with that department.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Scott Bauer in Madison, Wisconsin, and Ali Swenson in New York contributed to this report.",

        "text": "Harris and Trump offer worlds-apart contrasts on top issues in presidential race\nVoters in this year\u2019s presidential election are choosing between two conflicting visions of the United States offered by Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump. The outcome will affect how the country sees itself and how it\u2019s viewed across the world, with repercussions that could echo for decades.\n\nSince replacing President Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee, Harris has pledged to blaze her own path forward. But many of the vice president\u2019s ideas are well trod by Biden: middle-class tax cuts, tax increases on the wealthy and corporations, a restoration of abortion rights, a government that aggressively addresses climate change. and a commitment to uphold democratic values and the rule of law.\n\nTrump has pledged retaliation against rivals as he pushes to fulfill an agenda sidetracked during his previous term by the global pandemic. The former president wants to undertake a mass deportation of migrants who are living in the United States illegally, extend and expand his 2017 tax cuts, greatly increase tariffs and offer more support for fossil fuels and less support for renewable energy. He has attacked transgender rights and pledged to end Russia\u2019s war with Ukraine while suggesting Ukraine must make territorial concessions. He also is seeking to concentrate more government power within the White House.\n\nThe candidates have spelled out their ideas in speeches, advertisements and other venues. Both say that their approach would do more to lift up workers, the middle class and the promises that have defined America. While Trump and Harris agree on not taxing workers\u2019 tips, the similarities largely stop there \u2014 a further sign of how the election\u2019s outcome could reshape the country.\n\nA look at where each candidate stands on 10 top issues:\n\nAbortion\n\nHARRIS: She has called on Congress to pass legislation guaranteeing abortion access in federal law, a right that stood for nearly 50 years before being overturned by the Supreme Court in 2022. She has campaigned on how the patchwork of state laws limiting abortion have hurt women\u2019s access to medical care, in one prominent case leading to the death in Georgia of Amber Nicole Thurman.\n\nHarris has promoted the administration\u2019s efforts short of federal law, including steps to protect women who travel to access the procedure and limit how law enforcement collects medical records. Her argument to the public is rooted in the concept of freedom, saying \u201cthe freedom to make decisions about one\u2019s own body should not be made by the government.\u201d\n\nTRUMP: He often brags about nominating the Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe v. Wade. After dodging questions about when in pregnancy he believed abortion should be restricted, Trump announced last spring that decisions on access and cutoffs should be left to the states. He has praised the patchwork of restrictions that have emerged across Republican-led states, saying the people are deciding.\n\nHe has said he would not sign a national abortion ban into law and would not try to block access to abortion medication, after initially waffling. He told Time magazine that it should also be left up to states to determine whether to prosecute women for abortions or to monitor their pregnancies, but he has not rejected the idea outright. He has said that, if he wins, he wants to make in vitro fertilization treatment free for women. He has even claimed that he is the \u201cfather\u201d of the treatment, first used in 1978, even though it has only come under threat because of the overturning of Roe v. Wade.\n\nClimate and energy\n\nHARRIS: She has done something of an about-face, saying in her campaign that it\u2019s possible to continue hydraulic fracturing for fossil fuels even as she embraces policies that favor renewable energy resources. Republicans are quick to point out that Harris opposed offshore drilling and fracking during her short-lived campaign for the 2020 presidential nomination.\n\nAs a senator from California, Harris was an early sponsor of the Green New Deal, a sweeping series of proposals meant to swiftly move the U.S. to fully green energy. It was a plan championed by the Democratic Party\u2019s most progressive wing. But during her tenure as vice president, Harris has adopted more moderate positions, focusing on implementing the climate provisions of the Biden administration\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act. That provided nearly $375 billion for things such as financial incentives for electric cars and clean energy projects.\n\nThe Biden administration has also enlisted more than 20,000 young people in a national Climate Corps, a Peace Corps-like program to promote conservation through projects such as weatherizing homes and repairing wetlands. Despite that, it\u2019s unlikely that the U.S. will be on track to meet Biden\u2019s goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030.\n\nTRUMP: His mantra for one of his top policy priorities: \u201cDRILL, BABY, DRILL.\u201d Trump, who in the past said climate change was a \u201choax\u201d and harbors a particular disdain for wind power, says it\u2019s his goal for the U.S. to have the cheapest energy and electricity in the world. He has claimed he will cut prices in half within a year of his potential return to office. While he often criticizes the Biden administration for its policies, domestic oil production has already been at near-record highs since late 2023, according to the Energy Information Administration.\n\nTrump wants to push that higher by increasing oil drilling on public lands, offering tax breaks to oil, gas and coal producers, speeding the approval of natural gas pipelines, opening dozens of new power plants, including nuclear facilities, and rolling back the Biden administration\u2019s aggressive efforts to get people to switch to electric cars, which he argues have a place but shouldn\u2019t be forced on consumers. He has also pledged to re-exit the Paris climate agreement, end wind subsidies and eliminate regulations imposed and proposed by the Biden administration targeting energy-inefficient kinds of lightbulbs, stoves, dishwashers and shower heads.\n\nDemocracy and the rule of law\n\nHARRIS: Like Biden, Harris has decried Trump as a threat to the nation\u2019s democracy. She has agreed with former Trump administration officials who labeled him a \u201cfascist.\u201d\n\nHarris has leaned more heavily into her personal background as a prosecutor and contrasted that with Trump being found guilty of 34 felony counts in a New York hush money case and being found liable for fraudulent business practices and sexual abuse in civil court. Harris initially talked less frequently than Biden did about Trump\u2019s denial of his 2020 loss and his incitement of the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the Capitol. But in the closing weeks of the 2024 campaign, she increasingly has framed the prospect of another Trump term as \u201cdangerous.\u201d\n\nTRUMP: After refusing to accept that Biden won, Trump hasn\u2019t committed to accepting the 2024 results. He\u2019s repeatedly promised to pardon the Jan. 6 defendants jailed for assaulting police officers and other crimes during the attack on the Capitol, and recently threatened to jail lawyers, election officials, donors and others \u201cinvolved in unscrupulous behavior\u201d surrounding November\u2019s vote. He has lashed out at media organizations, threatening their broadcast licenses in response to debate questions and coverage he\u2019s deemed unfair.\n\nTrump has called his Democratic rivals the \u201cenemy within\u201d who are \u201cmore dangerous than China, Russia and all these countries.\u201d He pledges to overhaul the Justice Department and FBI \u201cfrom the ground up,\u201d aggrieved by the criminal charges the department has brought against him. He promises to deploy the National Guard to cities such as Chicago that are struggling with violent crime and in response to protests, and has also pledged to appoint a special prosecutor to go after Biden.\n\nFederal government\n\nHARRIS: Like Biden, Harris has campaigned hard against \u201cProject 2025\" \u2014 a plan that Trump has denounced but that was written by leading conservatives and many of his former administration officials.\n\nThe plan lays out how to move as swiftly as possible to dramatically remake the federal government and push it to the right if Trump wins the White House. She is also part of an administration that is taking steps to make it harder for any mass firings of civil servants to happen. In April, the Office of Personnel Management issued a new rule that would ban federal workers from being reclassified as political appointees or other at-will employees, thus making them easier to dismiss. That was in response to Schedule F, a 2020 executive order from Trump that reclassified tens of thousands of federal workers to make firing them easier.\n\nTRUMP: The former president has tried to distance himself from Project 2025, despite his close ties to many of its key architects. He has nonetheless pledged to undertake his own overhaul of the federal bureaucracy, which he has long blamed for blocking his first-term agenda, saying: \u201cI will totally obliterate the deep state.\u201d He plans to reissue the Schedule F order stripping civil service protections. He says he would then act to fire \u201crogue bureaucrats,\u201d including those who \u201dweaponized our justice system,\u201d and the \u201cwarmongers and America-Last globalists in the Deep State, the Pentagon, the State Department, and the national security industrial complex.\u201d\n\nTrump has pledged to terminate the Education Department and wants to curtail the independence of regulatory agencies such as the Federal Communications Commission. As part of his effort to cut government waste and red tape, he has promised to eliminate at least 10 federal regulations for every new one imposed.\n\nImmigration\n\nHARRIS: Trying to defuse GOP criticism, Harris has said she would sign into law a bipartisan Senate compromise killed by Republican lawmakers at Trump\u2019s request. It would have toughened asylum standards and meant more border agents, immigration judges and asylum officers. She said she would bring back that bill and sign it, saying that Trump \u201ctalks the talk, but doesn\u2019t walk the walk\u201d on immigration.\n\nHarris likes to talk up her experience as California attorney general, saying she walked drug smuggler tunnels and successfully prosecuted gangs that moved narcotics and people across the U.S.-Mexico border. Early in his term, Biden made Harris his administration\u2019s point person on the root causes of migration. Trump and top Republicans now blame Harris for a situation at that border, which they say is out of control due to policies that were too lenient. Harris has endorsed a comprehensive immigration overhaul, seeking paths to citizenship for immigrants in the U.S. without legal status, with a faster track for young immigrants living in the country illegally who arrived as children.\n\nTRUMP: He has returned to the harsh immigration rhetoric that marked his previous campaigns. He promises to mount the largest domestic deportation in U.S. history, an operation that could involve detention camps and the National Guard. He would bring back policies he put in place during his first term, like the Remain in Mexico program and Title 42, which placed curbs on migrants on public health grounds. He has called for the death penalty for any migrant who kills a U.S. citizen.\n\nTrump would revive and expand the travel ban that originally targeted citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries. After the Oct. 7, 2023, attack by Hamas on Israel, Trump pledged new \u201cideological screening\u201d for immigrants to bar \u201cdangerous lunatics, haters, bigots, and maniacs.\u201d He would try to deport people who are in the U.S. legally but harbor \u201cjihadist sympathies.\u201d He would seek to end birthright citizenship for people born in the U.S. whose parents are both in the country illegally.\n\nIsrael and Gaza\n\nHARRIS: Harris says Israel has a right to defend itself, and she\u2019s repeatedly decried Hamas as a terrorist organization. But the vice president might have helped defuse some backlash from progressives by being more vocal about the need to better protect civilians during fighting in Gaza.\n\nMore than 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war in Gaza, according to the Health Ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and militants in its count, but says that women and children make up just over half of the dead. Israel says it has killed more than 17,000 militants in the war.\n\nLike Biden, Harris supports a proposed hostage-for-extended cease-fire deal that aims to bring all remaining hostages and Israeli dead home. Biden and Harris say the deal could lead to a permanent end to the war and they have endorsed a two-state solution, which would have Israel existing alongside an independent Palestinian state. But Biden is also confronting the prospect of a widening conflict in Lebanon and attacks by Iran even as they both see Israel\u2019s recent killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar as a reason for a cease-fire to be more likely.\n\nTRUMP: He has expressed support for Israel\u2019s efforts to \u201cdestroy\u201d Hamas, but he\u2019s also been critical of some of Israel\u2019s tactics. He says the country must finish the job quickly and get back to peace. He has called for more aggressive responses to pro-Palestinian protests at college campuses and applauded police efforts to clear encampments. Trump also proposes to revoke the student visas of those who espouse antisemitic or anti-American views and deport those who support Hamas.\n\nLGBTQ+ issues\n\nHARRIS: During her rallies, Harris accuses Trump and his party of seeking to roll back a long list of freedoms, including the ability \u201cto love who you love openly and with pride.\u201d She leads audiences in chants of \u201cWe\u2019re not going back.\u201d\n\nWhile her campaign has yet to produce specifics on its plans, she has been part of a Biden administration that regularly denounces discrimination and attacks against the LGBTQ+ community. Early in Biden\u2019s term, his administration reversed an executive order from Trump that had largely banned transgender people from military service. His Education Department issued a rule that says Title IX, the 1972 law protecting women\u2019s rights, also bars discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. That rule was silent on the issue of transgender athletes.\n\nTRUMP: He has pledged to keep transgender women out of women\u2019s sports and says he will ask Congress to pass a bill establishing that \u201conly two genders,\u201d as determined at birth, are recognized by the United States. He promises to \u201cdefeat the toxic poison of gender ideology.\u201d\n\nAs part of his crackdown on gender-affirming care, he would declare that any health care provider participating in the \u201cchemical or physical mutilation of minor youth\u201d no longer meets federal health and safety standards and is barred from receiving federal money. He would take similarly punitive steps in schools against any teacher or school official who \u201csuggests to a child that they could be trapped in the wrong body.\u201d\n\nTrump would support a national prohibition of hormonal or surgical intervention for transgender minors and bar transgender people from military service.\n\nNATO and Ukraine\n\nHARRIS: The vice president has yet to specify how her positions on Russia\u2019s war with Ukraine might differ from Biden\u2019s, other than to praise his efforts to rebuild alliances unraveled by Trump, particularly NATO, the military alliance that is a critical bulwark against Russian aggression.\n\nThe Biden administration has pledged unceasing support for Ukraine against Russia\u2019s invasion. Washington has sent tens of billions of dollars in military and other aid to Ukraine, including $61 billion in weapons, ammunition and other assistance that is expected to last through the end of this year. The government has also reached an agreement with allies to provide Ukraine with a $50 billion loan \u2014 with $20 billion from the United States \u2014 that would be backed by frozen Russian financial assets.\n\nThe administration has maintained that continuing U.S. assistance is critical because Russian leader Vladimir Putin will not stop at invading Ukraine. Harris has said previously that it would be foolish to risk global alliances the U.S. has established and decried Putin\u2019s \u201cbrutality.\u201d\n\nTRUMP: The former president has repeatedly taken issue with U.S. aid to Ukraine and says he will continue to \u201cfundamentally reevaluate\u201d the mission and purpose of the NATO alliance if he returns to office. He has claimed, without explanation, that he will be able to end the war before his inauguration by bringing both sides to the negotiating table. (His approach seems to hinge on Ukraine giving up at least some of its Russian-occupied territory in exchange for a cease-fire.)\n\nOn NATO, he has assailed member nations for years for failing to meet agreed-upon military spending targets. Trump drew alarms this year when he said that, as president, he had warned leaders that he would not only refuse to defend nations that don\u2019t hit those targets, but that he also \u201cwould encourage\u201d Russia \u201cto do whatever the hell they want\u201d to countries that are \u201cdelinquent.\u201d\n\nTariffs and trade\n\nHARRIS: The Biden-Harris administration has tried to boost trade with allies in Europe, Asia and North America, while using tariffs and other targeted tools to go after rivals such as China. The Democratic administration kept Trump\u2019s tariffs on China in place, while adding a ban on exporting advanced computer chips to that country and providing incentives to boost U.S. industries.\n\nIn May, the administration specifically targeted China with increased tariffs on electric vehicles and steel and aluminum, among other products.\n\nTRUMP: He wants a dramatic expansion of tariffs on nearly all imported foreign goods, saying that \u201cwe\u2019re going to have 10% to 20% tariffs on foreign countries that have been ripping us off for years.\u201d He has suggested tariffs of 100% or more on Chinese goods. He treats these taxes as a way to fund other tax cuts, lower the deficit and possibly fund child care \u2014 though economists say the tariffs could raise prices for consumers without generating the revenues Trump promises.\n\nTrump would urge Congress to pass legislation giving the president authority to impose a reciprocal tariff on any country that imposes one on the U.S. Much of his trade agenda has focused on China. Trump has proposed phasing out Chinese imports of essential goods including electronics, steel and pharmaceuticals and wants to ban Chinese companies from owning U.S. infrastructure in sectors such as energy, technology and farmland.\n\nTaxes\n\nHARRIS: With much of the 2017 tax overhaul expiring at end of next year, Harris is pledging tax cuts for more than 100 million working and middle class households. In addition to preserving some of the expiring cuts, she wants to make permanent a tax credit of as much as $3,600 per child and offer a special $6,000 tax credit for new parents.\n\nHarris says her administration would expand tax credits for first-time homebuyers and would push to build 3 million new housing units in four years, while wiping out taxes on tips and endorsing tax breaks for entrepreneurs. Like Biden, she wants to raise the corporate tax rate to 28% and the corporate minimum tax to 21%. The current corporate rate is 21% and the corporate minimum, raised under the Inflation Reduction Act, is at 15% for companies making more than $1 billion a year. But Harris would not increase the capital gains tax as much as Biden had proposed on investors with more than $1 million in income.\n\nTRUMP: Trump has promised a slew of new tax cuts aimed at groups he has been trying to win over this election, including eliminating taxes on tips received by workers \u2014 a policy later embraced by Harris, who would also raise the minimum wage for tipped workers. Trump wants to eliminate taxes on Social Security benefits and taxes on overtime pay, and has pledged to make interest on car loans tax-deductible like mortgage payments -\u2013 but only for cars built in the U.S.\n\nThe former president has promised to extend and even expand all of the 2017 tax cuts that he signed into law, while also paying down the debt. He has proposed cutting the overall corporate tax rate to 15% from 21%, but only for companies that make their products in the U.S. He would repeal any tax increases signed into law by Biden. He also aims to gut some of the tax breaks that Biden put into law to encourage the development of renewable energy and EVs.\n\nHe wants to lower the cost of housing by opening up federal land to development. Outside analyses suggest that Trump\u2019s ideas would do much more to increase budget deficits than what Harris would do, without delivering the growth needed to minimize any additional debt.",

        "text": "Fascism shattered Europe a century ago \u2014 and historians hear echoes today in the U.S.\nIt was a time of historic change, and society was buckling under the stress. There had been a war, then a deadly pandemic. Economic crisis was constant: Racing inflation, unemployment and changes in technology provoked extreme economic insecurity.\n\nBut a leader emerged who understood the fear and humiliation felt by his public. He validated their rage and focused blame on a scapegoat. He pledged to make the nation whole again, to return it to its rightful glory. Much of the population, suffering so profoundly from the shock of loss and change and insecurity, embraced the leader as a sort of messiah. They accepted political violence, even welcomed it, and they turned away from democracy.\n\nThe scenario is historically accurate, but to which country does it apply? Italy in 1923? Germany in 1933? Or the United States today, nine weeks before the presidential election?\n\nThe answer, according to some UC Berkeley scholars, is that the scenario applies generally to all three: Italy during the rise of Benito Mussolini, Germany as Adolph Hitler maneuvered his way into power, and the United States, deeply polarized and tense as the MAGA movement led by former president Donald Trump moves to reclaim the White House.\n\nJohn Connelly UC Berkeley photo\n\nNone of the scholars forecast an imminent turn to autocracy in the U.S., and all were careful to say the U.S. experience today is in important ways different from devastating conditions that preceded the rise of European fascism in the 1920s and \u201830s. But in a series of interviews, experts who have studied the political and economic history of Europe traced dramatic and deeply troubling parallels between that era a century ago and this fraught American moment.\n\nAs in Europe after World War I, \u201cthere\u2019s kind of a disdain for democracy,\u201d said John Connelly, the eminent historian of modern Europe. \u201cThere\u2019s a willingness to think of going beyond the technicalities of a democratic system in order to solve problems. There\u2019s a longing \u2014 there\u2019s a respect for strong leadership that many believe is lacking in a standard liberal democracy.\u201d\n\nJason Wittenberg Brittany Hosea-Small for UC Berkeley\n\nThe view was not unanimous. Jason Wittenberg, a political scientist who has studied European politics and dictatorships, insisted that the U.S. military and other institutions would not succumb to strongman rule.\n\n\u201cMy bottom line is that fears about Trump are not entirely unfounded, but they\u2019re massively overblown,\u201d Wittenberg said. \u201cYes, he could do damage. But in the worst-case scenario, there\u2019s just no plausible circumstance under which an illiberal government could be implemented. There\u2019s no way it could happen.\u201d\n\nAnd yet, the cautious consensus that emerged from the interviews is that U.S. democracy is more vulnerable today than it has been since the Civil War more than 160 years ago. Several scholars believe the public\u2019s frustration and polarization, incidents and threats of right-wing violence, and a radical new Supreme Court ruling granting presidents broad immunity from the law could precipitate a break with democracy.\n\nAJ Solovy Courtesy of AJ Solovy\n\nSuch conditions undercut democracy in Italy and Germany, and the scholars see some of the same troubling signals here today.\n\nBecause the forces of history are so complex, \u201cI\u2019m wary of trying to draw exact parallels,\u201d said AJ Solovy, a Ph.D. student whose research is focused on German fascism. \u201cBut the Third Reich and Germany in the 1930s offer important, useful paradigms through which to understand this particular moment in the U.S. Even if there is not a one-to-one match, the themes that emerge \u2014 insecurity, crisis, a sort of existential political angst \u2014 can help explain why so many people are attracted to the MAGA movement.\u201d\n\nPut another way: It\u2019s not enough to look at how the leaders of anti-democratic movements might be alike. Instead, it\u2019s essential to look at the broader conditions that allowed for the rise of those movements.\n\nCondition No. 1: An era of extraordinary instability, loss and perceived humiliation\n\nAny discussion of 20th century fascism in Italy and Germany begins with World War I. The war brought a level of death and devastation that had never been seen before. New weapons technology turned portions of Europe into a killing field. Relentless shelling barrages didn\u2019t merely maim and kill, but obliterated bodies on a mass scale.\n\nGermany lost the war, and Italy was on the winning side. But for both, the aftermath was devastating: Millions dead and wounded. The Spanish flu, and thousands more dead. Hyperinflation, unemployment, widespread hunger. Grave polarization and political instability. And then, the Great Depression.\n\nWorld War I, the Spanish Flu epidemic, and devastating inflation wracked Germany with hunger and instability. Here, German young people and women strip meat from a horse that died on a Berlin street, circa 1918. Collection of the Imperial War Museums, United King\n\nLeaders, the military and the people in both nations felt crushed and humiliated.\n\nThe traditional order was dissolving, and crisis was constant. The Russian Revolution appealed to many, but also provoked widespread fear of communism. Women were gaining political emancipation. Film and radio were extending their reach. Modern art was rejecting the subjects and styles of the past. Political and culture wars raged across the landscape.\n\nLawrence Rosenthal\n\nIn both countries, the scholars said, people suffered from a profound sense of dislocation. Lawrence Rosenthal, a scholar of Italian fascism and the founder of the UC Berkeley Center for Right-Wing Studies, described it as a violent break between past and future that affected tens of millions of people.\n\nBoth Italy and Germany were deeply divided between advanced industrial areas and rural regions that seemed stuck in a feudal era that hadn\u2019t changed in centuries, Rosenthal said. He imagined the experience of young Italian soldiers who lived through the war and the flu pandemic.\n\n\u201cWhen the war is over, they go back to their villages, their hometowns, and they don\u2019t fit anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything has changed.\u201d\n\nAfter the horrors of war, they have changed, too \u2014 they\u2019re lost, alienated, dispossessed. What remained was their shared experience with other soldiers, \u201cthe brotherhood of the trenches,\u201d Rosenthal said. \u201cAnd this was a potential mass base for fascism.\u201d\n\nIn such tectonic shocks, the scholars see strong but uneven parallels between Europe in the 1920s and \u201830s and the U.S. today. COVID parallels the Spanish flu. The U.S. is divided between regions thriving in the information economy and chronically depressed Rust Belt and rural regions. But while the U.S. has suffered from inflation since the pandemic ended, hyperinflation in Germany was almost 1,000 times worse. And the U.S. has no recent experience comparable to World War I or the Depression.\n\nStill, questions remain: Even if Americans have not been exposed to such a shattering experience, is it possible that a series of smaller shocks could cause similar trauma? And could this trauma fuel an authoritarian political movement in the U.S.?\n\nCondition No. 2: In a time of traumatic upheaval, some people seek order at any cost\n\nUlrike Malmendier\n\nUlrike Malmendier, a behavioral economist at Berkeley\u2019s Haas School of Business, has conducted influential research into how the Great Depression and other traumatic experiences shape people\u2019s worldviews and decisions, even decades later.\n\nMalmendier said trauma researchers generally categorize two sorts of experience: \u201cbig-T trauma,\u201d such as a war, extreme economic crisis, sexual assault or terrorist attack; and \u201csmall-t trauma,\u201d such as the modest, but painful, \u201cpaper cuts\u201d that we accumulate in daily life.\n\nThink about food insecurity in a time of inflation. \u201cIt\u2019s not that you have no access to food and you\u2019re starving,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you have this insecurity that food might not be available, or you might not have enough, because prices are rising.\u201d\n\nChanging technology, changing demographics and the shocks of economic globalization can have a similar effect.\n\nA couple walks across Sproul Plaza on a Wednesday in Sept. 2020 as the sun filtered through a dome of smoke cast a strange orange glow over the landscape. The drought and recurring wildfires that signal climate change are among the many crises that have marked a coming of age for Berkeley students. (UC Berkeley photo by Irene Yi)\n\nMalmendier explained: \u201cPeople think, \u2018Something around me isn\u2019t quite as it used to be. My work skills might not be as valuable as they were. I\u2019m constantly worrying, \u2018What does that mean for me?\u2019\n\n\u201cWith technological change, or demographic change, the constant worry of how you fit into this place might be as big as if there was a war \u2014 \u2018I now live in a different environment. I\u2019m feeling displaced.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn effect, Malmendier said, trauma rewires our brains. Even modest change can be traumatic and can trigger a primal impulse to avoid further shocks. People might imagine that things would be better if only they could return to the order of the good old days.\n\nNow consider the U.S. experience since the start of the 21st century: The 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001 were followed quickly by wars in Afghanistan and Iraq that lasted for years and ended in stalemate. The Great Recession in 2008 and 2009 wiped out savings and drove a spike in unemployment.\n\nThe nation\u2019s demographics were changing. While many celebrated the election of Barack Obama as the nation\u2019s first Black president in 2008, and the nomination of Hillary Clinton as the first woman to win a major-party presidential nomination in 2016, many others were deeply resentful. For some, resentment extended to the legalization of same-sex marriage and the expansion of rights for transgender and nonbinary people.\n\nThe era has featured almost unchecked random mass shootings and declining affiliation with traditional religion. Technological change has been rapid and disruptive; the internet, smartphones and social media have overwhelmed us with disinformation. In the aftermath, political and social polarization has steadily deepened.\n\nDavid Clay Large Doug McClelland\n\nChronic insecurity can be a powerful driver of anti-democratic movements, said David Clay Large, a senior fellow at the Berkeley\u2019s Institute of European Studies.\n\n\u201cSocial change \u2014 gender, art, politics, class \u2014 leads to insecurity,\u201d said Large. \u201cPeople get used to certain norms, a certain place in the world. Then their world is turned upside down. In Europe in the \u201820s, it happened quickly. In this country, it\u2019s been more gradual.\n\n\u201cThere is a feeling of having lost something, sometimes a mythologized or romanticized past that people claim they\u2019re missing. You can say that\u2019s nonsense, but they still feel it. And that\u2019s important.\u201d\n\nMalmendier hasn\u2019t studied anti-democratic movements, but she sees a connection: Once this sort of trauma gets wired into the brain, people can believe it\u2019s \u201cvery, very likely that the next traumatic event is just around the corner,\u201d she explained. \u201cThey might make an exaggerated attempt to avoid being put in this painful situation again.\n\n\u201cThat is where you might see a link to extremism, or maybe populism.\u201d\n\nCondition No. 3: A strongman leader appeals to the fear and rage of his public\n\nIn simple terms, populism is a social movement that seeks to turn back the clock, by extreme measures, if necessary. Nationalism is a natural extension, an effort to return the nation to its imagined former greatness.\n\nBoth are fueled by a widespread sense of loss and humiliation, and by grievance and resentment. There\u2019s a sense, the scholars said, that modern ways aren\u2019t serving the needs of the masses, and the masses need to seize power and restore order and justice.\n\nIn such conditions, Connelly and others said, people can turn away from democracy \u2014 and toward an authoritarian leader.\n\nAdolph Hitler had a theatrical, almost baroque oratorical style, a pattern seen in some other autocratic leaders in the past century. Heinrich Hoffmann / German Federal Archives via Wikimedia\n\n\u201cIn Italy in the early 1920s,\u201d Connelly said, \u201cthere was a sense across the political spectrum: We need a person who can really break through these old, decrepit structures of liberal order that went back several decades to the creation of modern Italy.\n\n\u201cMussolini appealed to people of many backgrounds, in the center of the political spectrum, as a force of order and strength. As a former socialist, he could project concern for the broad populace.\u201d\n\nSimilar social dynamics allowed Hitler to rise to power. Both he and Mussolini emerged from the humiliation and bitterness of World War I on a promise to restore the greatness of the nation and its people.\n\nIt\u2019s an essential point: None of the Berkeley scholars put Trump in the same category as Hitler or Mussolini. But, they said, it\u2019s difficult to ignore some similarities between them.\n\nEach of them has been described as chronically dishonest and highly manipulative. Each had a flamboyant, theatrical speaking style, and they were able to summon the admiration and provoke the fury of their fanatically loyal supporters. Both Hitler and Mussolini served time in jail, while Trump has been found liable for a range of criminal and civil offenses and could be facing jail time. Their legions held steady.\n\nWe\u2019re gonna put kids in cages. It\u2019s going to be glorious.\u201d Mike Davis, a top legal adviser to former President Donald Trump\n\nTrump has never sought overtly to become a dictator, but he has at times suggested that he might. He consistently held himself out as a man of singular strength who could rescue the nation when other leaders and institutions failed.\n\n\u201cI alone can fix it,\u201d he famously said in his first campaign. Later, he proclaimed to his followers: \u201cI am your warrior. I am your justice. And for those who have been wronged and betrayed: I am your retribution.\u201d\n\nAll three men were at times seen as messiahs. And all survived assassination attempts.\n\nCondition No. 4: The leader employs violence to impose order and obedience\n\nFascism, said Rosenthal, historically is characterized by the use of organized militias that answer to the leader or the state, deployed to impose order and consolidate fascist power \u2014 often through violence.\n\nMussolini sent his Blackshirts to the March on Rome in 1922 to threaten the national government, and the government capitulated. Stormtroopers attached to the Nazi Party violently harassed communists, Jews and others and were a critical force in Hitler\u2019s rise to power.\n\nBenito Mussoline, center, confers with leaders of his Blackshirt militia in the days before the 1922 March on Rome that brought him to power. Wikipedi\n\nWhile Trump never had a MAGA militia, he has encouraged followers to assault protesters or journalists. Through his first term, he built a loose alliance with the Proud Boys, the Oath Keepers and other armed groups that embrace hard-right, often racist ideology.\n\nTrump in effect summoned them to Washington, D.C., on the eve of congressional certification of Democrat Joe Biden\u2019s win in the November 2020 election, and then seemed to incite them just before the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\nLeaders and members of those militia groups have been prosecuted and imprisoned for their violent effort to prevent an orderly transfer of power. Trump has described them as political prisoners, and has said he \u201cabsolutely\u201d would consider pardoning them if he\u2019s re-elected.\n\nCondition No. 5: The leader identifies scapegoats and attacks them relentlessly\n\nRight-wing populism, said Connelly, \u201cis always directed against others. What unites all of these forces is a hostility to foreigners, to people who are different, to the other. Hitler was overtly anti-Semitic, an overt racist. Mussolini was anti-Slavic because of the perception that Croatians and Slovenians had stolen Italian territory.\u201d\n\nHitler\u2019s rhetoric had a sharp, sinister edge. Said Solovy: \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that it enabled violence and genocide.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s use of scapegoating has been a defining trait of his movement. In the initial days of his presidency, he banned people from six Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S. His movement has featured escalating attacks on LGBTQ+ and transgender people. He has persistently insulted and condemned migrants crossing the southern border into the U.S., calling them at various times rapists, mentally ill and \u201cvermin\u201d who are, in his view, \u201cpoisoning the blood of our country.\u201d\n\nCritics have noted the similarity of Trump\u2019s dehumanizing language to Nazi smears against the Jews.\n\nStill, fierce opposition to immigration remains central to the MAGA movement, and it is a crucial focus of the controversial Project 2025 plan that is seen as a blueprint for a second Trump term. Trump\u2019s allies have openly predicted that, if he\u2019s reelected, the government will round up millions of legal and undocumented migrants, hold them in mass concentration camps, and then deport them.\n\nAttorney Mike Davis, a former Supreme Court clerk whose name has been floated as a possible U.S. attorney general under Trump, recently described these goals in chilling detail:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re gonna deport a lot of people, 10 million people and growing \u2014 anchor babies, their parents, their grandparents. We\u2019re gonna put kids in cages. It\u2019s going to be glorious.\u201d\n\nCondition No. 6: Democratic institutions remove limits on the leader\u2019s authority\n\nThere is a final parallel \u2014 and for some of the scholars, one of jarring importance.\n\nEarly in the leadership of both Mussolini and Hitler, lawmaking bodies gave them enormous authority to suspend rights and processes in place under Italian and German democracy.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court, just two months ago, issued a controversial landmark ruling that seems to give presidents broad immunity from prosecution if they break laws in the course of their duties.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision to grant broad immunity to presidential actions, regardless of criminal motives, poses a threat to the rule of law, Berkeley scholars say. MattWade via Wikimedia Commons\n\nHow does that decision compare to the rulings in Europe during the rise of fascism?\n\n\u201cThis is probably the most controversial thing I can say,\u201d Rosenthal replied, \u201cbut I believe that there is a parallel between the German Enabling Act in 1933 and the Supreme Court decision on immunity.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. court ruled that \u201cthe president essentially enjoys impunity,\u201d Connelly added. \u201cThey\u2019re withdrawing themselves from the process, when they\u2019re supposed to be a check on the process. Similarly, institutional checks on abuse of power failed in Germany.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. has its own unique strains of illiberalism\n\nFor Large and Wittenberg, the idea that conditions in the U.S. match those in post-WWI Italy and Germany goes only so far. For both, the parallels diverge in important ways.\n\nEven before the U.S. formed in the late 1700s, Large said, an anti-democratic impulse was evident. That was most acute in matters of race and ethnicity: slavery and the Civil War, genocide against Indigenous people; Supreme Court rulings that justified segregation Jim Crow laws and lynchings. Wave after wave of immigrants arrived in the U.S. to a fiercely hostile reception.\n\nHistorian David Clay Large recounts the United States\u2019 long illiberal history: genocide against Indigenous people, slavery, Jim Crow laws, and long resistance to equal rights for women. Underwood & Underwood, from the U.S. Library of Congress\n\nIn Europe a century ago, there was no force comparable to the hard-right evangelical Christians who form a core of the MAGA movement. Nor did Europe allow almost unchecked private possession of guns. Today in the U.S., thousands \u2014 perhaps millions \u2014 in the MAGA ranks own weapons of war. Many of them consider guns a right ordained by God.\n\nThose currents in American culture today resist any control on guns, despite epidemic mass shootings. MAGA forces seek to ban the teaching of the nation\u2019s racial history in schools, and they justify sweeping campaigns to control women\u2019s reproductive rights and to strip basic rights from LGBTQ+ Americans.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we have to say, \u2018Oh God, we\u2019re in trouble in this country because we\u2019re going to go fascist like the Europeans,\u2019\u201d Large said. \u201cI say we\u2019re in trouble because we\u2019re going to go fascist like the Americans.\u201d\n\nDuring the 2022 midterm election campaign, U.S. Senate candidate Blake Masters of Arizona embodied a modern political archetype: A white man with deep grievances and a belief in racist conspiracy theories \u2014 and weapons as a thinly veiled threat against the prevailing political order. Photo from Masters for Senate campaign video.\n\nWittenberg, the political scientist, acknowledges such worries. But in his view, there is no practical way that Trump or any other president could impose an authoritarian government. The country is too big, he said. Our institutions are too dispersed, too entrenched. The military would never go along.\n\nA greater concern, for Wittenberg, is that by exaggerating the risk of an authoritarian takeover, we\u2019ll miss the slow erosion of democratic institutions and processes driven by both Republicans and Democrats \u2014 the greater use of executive orders by presidents, for example, or simply our uncompromising resistance to outcomes in which our opponents win.\n\nSuppose Trump is reelected, he mused, and suppose his administration weakens or abolishes the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019ll have dirtier air,\u201d he said. Some voters will be furious, \u201cbut there\u2019s nothing essential to democracy about having clean air. The Constitution explicitly states that powers not mentioned in that document are thrown back to the states. So arguably, it\u2019s more democratic.\u201d\n\nCongress can block the effort or impeach the president, or voters can challenge the decision in court. It\u2019s messy, Wittenberg said, but that\u2019s the nature of our system.\n\n\u201cDemocracy doesn\u2019t always give you good outcomes,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, democracy produces people like Trump. And if you think that people like Trump should not be allowed to run for president, or support efforts to invalidate his candidacy, then you have a problem with democracy.\u201d\n\nThe guardrails of democracy may not be as strong as we think\n\nWith Kamala Harris surging in the polls and the Trump campaign struggling to gain traction, there\u2019s a temptation to believe that the risk of a democratic crack-up might soon be erased. But several scholars cautioned against that view. The anti-democratic dynamics that shape our era will not go away with one election, they say.\n\nAnd so the future seems to turn on a central question: Is Wittenberg right, that what happened in Germany and Italy can\u2019t happen here? Or could a majority of Americans turn against democracy, as Italians and Germans did a century ago?\n\nBoth Rosenthal and Large agree that the nation\u2019s long tradition of democracy and its deeply embedded institutions are far stronger than those in Italy and Germany.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s true, and that can help,\u201d Large said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think the guardrails are as strong as a lot of people think.\u201d\n\nCompared to Germany and Italy, \u201cthe mountain to climb in America is much steeper for illiberal movements,\u201d Rosenthal added. \u201cI agree with that 100%. But there is a clich\u00e9 which says that when these things go, they go quickly. I would add that as an addendum.\u201d\n\nWhich leaves Americans and the rest of the world to closely watch the guardrails leading up to Nov. 5, and in the weeks after. The future is uncertain \u2014 and that, too, is how democracy works.\n\n\u201cIn the next several months, there are going to be surprises,\u201d Rosenthal said. \u201cThat\u2019s the only thing we can be certain of.\u201d",

        "text": "Ag Policies and Presidential Election\nOMAHA (DTN) -- Farm leaders from opposite sides of the aisle agree the country needs a new farm bill, but they are split on taxes, regulations, trade policies and just how farmers and the agricultural economy will fare under the next presidency.\n\nThe Farm Foundation on Monday hosted a live-streamed forum at the National Press Club to look at farm policy differences between the presidential candidates. The event touched on a wide range of issues, including trade, the farm bill, tax policy, China, climate-smart programs and nutrition.\n\nThe forum offered an amicable policy debate leading up to Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump's debate scheduled for Tuesday evening.\n\nSpeaking for former President Trump's campaign was Kip Tom, former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Agencies for Food and Agriculture. Tom, an Indiana farmer, is co-leader of the Farmers and Ranchers for Trump 47 coalition.\n\nCiting statistics from a conservative business group, Tom said the Biden-Harris administration has imposed $1.6 trillion in new regulations that are costing the American economy and costing farmers. Talking about inflation, Tom said, \"Kamala Harris needs to look no further for price gouging than to look in the mirror at herself.\"\n\nStanding in for Vice President Harris' campaign was Rod Snyder, former senior adviser for agriculture at EPA under the Biden administration, and former staff member of the National Corn Growers Association and CropLife.\n\nReferring to the first Trump term in which the average net farm income was one-third less than it was under Biden, Snyder said farmers lost $29 billion in exports during the trade war in 2018 and 2019.\n\n\"The four years of the Trump presidency was defined by chaos and uncertainty for the farm economy, and a second term would be even more severe.\"\n\nTRADE\n\nTrade was a major topic with agriculture now looking at a $30.5 billion trade deficit for fiscal-year 2024 as exports are projected to finish the fiscal year at $173.5 billion while imports are forecast at $204 billion. The agricultural trade deficit is projected to widen to $42.5 billion for fiscal-year 2025 as well.\n\nTariffs are a key to Trump's trade policies. He has proposed a 10% tariff on all imports and a 60% tariff on imports from China. Trump said those tariffs would generate more federal revenue that would be used to pay down the budget deficit.\n\nHarris so far has said little on trade policy but seems in line with President Joe Biden by focusing more on protecting manufacturing and labor, but no specific negotiations for broader trade agreements. Like Biden, she largely would hold the current tariffs on China in place.\n\nSnyder noted taxpayers had to pick up the bill for $23 billion in support payments to farmers during the first China trade war. Citing Trump's current proposals, Snyder said, \"There's no question the type of retaliatory behavior that would come from other countries in terms of market access for farmers.\" Snyder added an expert told him, \"The impacts of that could make the 1980s farm crisis look like a picnic in terms of the way the markets could dry up overnight because of those tariffs.\"\n\nTom pointed to the Trump administration's Phase 1 agreement with China that boosted sales to $38 billion -- during the early part of Biden's term. He cited negotiations with Japan and other countries to expand agricultural access under Trump.\n\n\"They left agriculture in good shape when they left their offices,\" Tom said. He added, \"We've had no trade deals under the Harris administration -- none.\"\n\nLater Tom said the U.S. is relying on highly subsidized imports from China, and the Biden administration left in place a lot of the earlier Trump tariffs.\n\n\"The reality is those tariffs will be out there. There's no question Trump wants to deal with them. He took care of us before when he did it originally, and he will take care of us this time too.\"\n\nTom said Trump's administration negotiated a high number of trade deals to increase access to foreign markets while those talks have not happened under Biden's team. Snyder pointed to more access for ethanol to Japan and the Biden trade negotiators opening Mexico for potatoes for the first time in decades. Snyder said relying on tariffs is unsustainable. \"The American consumer pays for that,\" he said.\n\nTAX POLICY\n\nThe 2017 tax cuts pushed by former President Trump and signed into law will start to phase out at the end of 2025. Tom said one of the biggest risks to farmers under Harris would be a change in the \"death tax,\" as the estate-tax exemption could be lowered and more farmers would be caught up in it because of higher land values.\n\n\"It can be the most undermining issue taking away farmers and ranchers as we know them today,\" Tom said.\n\nTom said the Harris administration is proposing to take away stepped-up bases and tax unrealized net gains.\n\n\"We're talking about increasing the tax on corporations from 20% to 28%. Some are wanting to go down to 15%,\" Tom said.\n\nSnyder said Trump's tax cuts largely benefited the top 1% of Americans and would add $4.6 trillion to the national debt if given a full extension.\n\n\"The vast majority of that benefit did go to the top 1% earners of the United States. That's not your average farmer across the country or rural residents,\" Snyder said.\n\nOn the estate tax, Snyder said proposed changes would not affect middle-class farmers. \"We're really talking about 1% of farmers, not the average farmers across the country, that would be impacted.\"\n\nLABOR, DEPORTATIONS\n\nAgriculture relies heavily on migrant labor with studies showing a high percentage of workers may be in the country illegally. Farmers also have increasingly turned to the H-2A guest-worker program, which now brings in more than 300,000 workers a year.\n\nWhile Trump has pushed for more aggressive deportations, Tom said he did not think that would have a major ripple effect on agricultural and food processors such as meatpacking plants.\n\n\"I'm not worried about them being raided and losing their workforce, but we do have an illegal immigration problem that needs to be resolved,\" Tom said.\n\nSnyder noted Congress has repeatedly attempted bipartisan agricultural labor bills that have been blocked by Republicans in Congress. \"I think largely our friends on the right have torpedoed that because they really don't want to solve the problem,\" he said.\n\nCLIMATE, GREEN POLICIES\n\nTom said farmers are already using less chemicals and fertilizer and improving the air and water quality. Tom suggested he doesn't support the Biden administration's climate-smart funding.\n\n\"We don't get caught up in gimmicks, cute names, anything like that.\" Tom added, \"I don't think this is any role the government needs to be playing in. I think it's up to us farmers to do this in the private sector.\"\n\nSnyder said the federal government plays a critical role in helping fund conservation practices and boosting support for programs to create Sustainable Aviation Fuel and accelerate demand. He also said climate-smart programs at USDA are voluntary and have generated a high volume of demand from producers. \"This is about voluntary, incentive-based programs that can help meet the market demand.\"\n\nUSDA first provided $3.2 billion in climate-smart grants for more than 140 projects nationally. Then the Inflation Reduction Act was passed, adding $19.5 billion to be spent by USDA's traditional conservation programs by 2031. Snyder said, \"These voluntary programs have been a tremendous success story.\"\n\nTom countered that a lot of the money was going to non-governmental entities, and not farmers. \"The reality is I don't think any of this has made it to the farm gate.\"\n\nFARM BILL\n\nBoth Snyder and Tom agreed with farm groups that Congress needs to pass a farm bill as quickly as possible and not wait until the next administration to get it done. \"American agriculture wants Congress to get this done as quickly as possible,\" Snyder said.\n\nTom agreed that a farm bill needs to be passed \"the sooner the better,\" adding that farmers right now face several years of surplus crops and lower prices \"all because of the lack of trade under the Biden-Harris administration.\"\n\nThe full two-hour forum will be posted on the Farm Foundation's website: https://www.farmfoundation.org/\u2026 .\n\nChris Clayton can be reached at Chris.Clayton@dtn.com\n\nFollow him on social platform X @ChrisClaytonDTN\n\n(c) Copyright 2024 DTN, LLC.

        "text": "Voting in the 2024 U.S. Election (September 9, 2024)\nMessage for U.S. Citizens:\n\nVoting in the 2024 U.S. Election\n\n(September 9, 2024)\n\nThere are less than 60 days until November 5, Election Day in the United States. U.S. citizens overseas can vote \u2013 the U.S. Mission to Vietnam is here to help!\n\nTo vote in the November 2024 election, U.S. citizens overseas need to have completed a Federal Post Card Application (FPCA) in 2024. Whether you are a first-time voter or have already received ballots and voted absentee in past elections, you must complete an FPCA each calendar year to ensure you can participate in elections as an overseas absentee voter.\n\nPlease note that you cannot vote at the Embassy or Consulate General, but our team can provide voter assistance or send completed election-related mail (registration forms, completed ballots). Drop off your completed voting forms and ballots at the Embassy or Consulate General, addressed to your local election officials, for delivery to the United States via diplomatic pouch.\n\nBallots can be dropped off at the U.S. Embassy in Hanoi or the Consulate General in Ho Chi Minh City, from 9:00 A.M. to 4:30 P.M. Monday through Friday (excluding these holidays).\n\nBe prepared to present your U.S. passport during your visit and remember to seal your ballot. You can also return your FPCA or ballot to your local election officials via international mail or professional courier service at your own expense. The Department of State is recommending that all election-related mail be sent by October 5, 2024.\n\nEven if you have never voted while overseas before, the process is easy.\n\nRequest your ballot. Complete a new Federal Post Card Application (FPCA). You must complete a new FPCA after January 1, 2024, to ensure you receive your ballot for the 2024 elections. Submitting the FPCA allows you to request absentee ballots for all elections for federal offices (President, U.S. Senate, and U.S. House of Representatives) including primaries and special elections during the calendar year in which it is submitted. All local election officials in all U.S. states and territories accept the FPCA.\n\nYou can complete the FPCA online at FVAP.gov. The online voting assistant will ask you questions specific to your state. We encourage you to request your blank ballots be delivered electronically (by email, internet download, or fax, depending on your state). Include your email address on your FPCA to take advantage of the electronic ballot delivery option. Return the FPCA per the instructions on the website. The online voting assistant will tell you if your state allows the FPCA to be returned electronically or if you must submit a paper copy with original ink signature. If you must return a paper version, please follow the same instructions below for returning your ballot.\n\nReceive and complete your ballot. States are required to send out ballots 45 days before a regular election for federal office and generally send ballots at least 30 days before primary elections. For most states, you can confirm your registration and ballot delivery online. Return your completed ballot. While some states allow you to return your completed ballot electronically, others do not. If your state requires you to return paper voting forms or ballots to local election officials, you can do so free of charge at the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate. Place your ballot in a postage-paid return envelope, or in an envelope bearing sufficient domestic U.S. postage, and address it to the relevant local election officials.\n\nResearch candidates and issues. Please see the FVAP links page for resources you can use to research candidates and issues. FVAP regularly sends information about election dates and deadlines through their Voting Alerts. Email vote@fvap.gov to subscribe or follow FVAP on Facebook or Twitter.\n\nLearn more at the Federal Voting Assistance Program\u2019s (FVAP) website, FVAP.gov. If you have any questions about registering to vote overseas, please contact your nearest embassy or consulate. Contact information is below.\n\nIf you need further assistance, the U.S. Consulate General in Ho Chi Minh City will have two upcoming community events \u2013 in Ho Chi Minh City, Da Nang, Ha Tinh, and Nghe An.\n\nAssistance:\n\nYou are receiving our newsletters and updates because you have enrolled in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP). If you are departing Vietnam after a long stay, please be sure to update your status in STEP: https://step.state.gov. Please note that by updating your status you will no longer receive any messages sent by the Embassy and Consulate General to U.S. citizens in Vietnam. If you encounter any difficulties with your travel registration account, please send an e-mail to CASTEP@state.gov.",

        "text": "Trump threatens to jail adversaries if he wins US presidential election\nWith just days before his first and most likely the only debate against Kamala Harris, Donald Trump posted a warning on his social media site, threatening to prosecute those \u201cinvolved in unscrupulous behavior\u201d in this election if he wins.\n\nHe stated, \u201cWhen I win, those people that cheated will be prosecuted\u2026with long-term prison sentences.\u201d\n\nTrump claims the election will be under intense scrutiny and extended the threat to lawyers, political operatives, donors, illegal voters, and corrupt election officials.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is the latest in a series of statements where Trump has threatened to use the presidency for retribution if he secures a second term.\n\nDespite his ongoing claims, there is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election, which courts and officials confirmed was fair.\n\nTrump also announced he would establish a government efficiency commission, led by billionaire Elon Musk, if he wins the November 5 election. He made the statement while outlining his economic vision at the New York Economic Club.\n\nAdditionally, Trump warned that American universities promoting what he described as \u201cantisemitic propaganda\u201d could face losing accreditation and federal funding under his administration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump has been convicted in New York for falsifying business records and is facing several other legal cases, including charges related to his efforts to overturn his 2020 defeat.\n\nDespite these legal challenges, he remains focused on the November 5 election, where polls indicate a close race against Harris.\n\nWhile Trump\u2019s aides urge him to focus on campaign issues like inflation and border security, he continues to revisit old grievances, including allegations of sexual misconduct and legal battles.\n\nThe single debate between Trump and Harris will be held on Tuesday, hosted by ABC.\n\n(With inputs from The Guardian)",

Their analysis of presidential elections going all the way back to 1860 served as the basis for their formula. The 13 true or false questions that make up the keys are parameters that, if true, support stability.The operation is quite straightforward. They are expected to lose if six or more keys, and any six, go against the White House party. Lichtman told Fox News Digital this week that they were expected to win. This also led to a prediction of Donald Trump 's win, which made me virtually alone in making that prediction in 2016. Because of this, Lichtman predicts that they are going to have a precedent-breaking election and Kamala Harris will become the first woman President of the United States. Harris says that the Democrats she represents could lose at most five keys.Now that Biden has withdrawn, the Democrats have lost the incumbency advantage. Given how things were going, the Democrats might lose the election if Biden left the race due to a major party fight and the loss of a second key. However, the Democrats eventually showed wisdom and coalesced around Harris, which helped to keep the contest crucial. Thus, they only lost one key as a result of the shift. The contest key, according to Lichtman, has no serious contest for the incumbent party nomination.The party mandate, incumbent, third party, short- and long-term economies, policy changes, social unrest, scandal, foreign and military failure, success, and incumbent and challenger charisma are the other crucial factors. Having Harris front and centre rather than Joe Biden, the policymaker, has dampened enthusiasm for protests, which helped salvage a second key, the social unrest key. The keys show that Kamala Harris is a predicted winner.The 13 true or false indicators that make up Allan Lichtman's \"Keys to the White House\" model determine whether the incumbent party will win or lose depending on how many keys they control.Lichtman thinks Harris will prevail because, with Biden's resignation, the Democrats have only lost one crucial element, incumbency, and thus have enough advantages to win.",

        "text": "Justice Department Issues New Guidance on Federal Law Regarding Voter Registration\nThe Justice Department announced today that it has published a new guidance addressing limits on when and how jurisdictions may remove voters from their voter lists. The guidance document reflects the department\u2019s commitment to ensuring that every eligible voter can exercise their right to vote free of discrimination or voter intimidation.\n\n\u201cEnsuring that every eligible voter is able to vote and have that vote counted is a critical aspect of sustaining a robust democracy, and it is a top priority for the Justice Department,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division. \u201cAs we approach Election Day, it is important that states adhere to all aspects of federal law that safeguard the rights of eligible voters to remain on the active voter lists and to vote free from discrimination and intimidation.\u201d\n\nIn its guidance, the department reminds states that efforts to ensure accurate and current voting rolls must be accomplished in compliance with federal law and in a nondiscriminatory manner. Specifically, the department explains important limits imposed by federal law on the rules and procedures states may adopt regarding their voter registration lists. For example, list maintenance efforts must be uniform and nondiscriminatory, and a program to systematically remove ineligible voters must not be done within 90 days of a federal election. There also are specific rules about how to remove registered voters because they have moved. Importantly, these federal protections apply whether the process is initiated by the state or is responsive to third-party submissions.\n\nThe department also released a fact sheet as a resource for jurisdictions and provides information on certain civil provisions of federal law that protect the right to vote.\n\nSection 11(b) of the Voting Rights Act: Federal law broadly prohibits intimidation, threats and coercion \u2014 or attempts to do so \u2014 throughout every stage of the voting process, including registering to vote, casting a ballot and counting votes.\n\nFederal law broadly prohibits intimidation, threats and coercion \u2014 or attempts to do so \u2014 throughout every stage of the voting process, including registering to vote, casting a ballot and counting votes. Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act: Federal law also prohibits discrimination in voting because of race, color or membership in a minority language group, defined to include American Indian, Asian American, Alaskan Native and Spanish heritage citizens.\n\nFederal law also prohibits discrimination in voting because of race, color or membership in a minority language group, defined to include American Indian, Asian American, Alaskan Native and Spanish heritage citizens. Section 208 of the Voting Rights Act: For voters with disabilities and those unable to read or write, federal law guarantees voting assistance in all aspects of the voting process by a person of the voter\u2019s choice subject to only two exceptions barring assistance by the voter\u2019s employer or union. And, under the Americans with Disabilities Act , state and local governments must ensure people with disabilities have a full and equal opportunity to vote.\n\nFor voters with disabilities and those unable to read or write, federal law guarantees voting assistance in all aspects of the voting process by a person of the voter\u2019s choice subject to only two exceptions barring assistance by the voter\u2019s employer or union. And, under the , state and local governments must ensure people with disabilities have a full and equal opportunity to vote. Section 203 of the Voting Rights Act: The fact sheet explains that some jurisdictions, as determined by the Census Bureau, are required to provide all election information that is available in English in the covered minority language.\n\nIn April, the department announced an updated website, www.justice.gov/voting, a one-stop resource for information on voting and elections. This website includes guides on a range of topics to inform voters and state and local election officials. It includes, among other topics, information about Voting Protections for Language Minority Citizens under Section 203 of the Voting Rights Act, state-by-state rules regarding voting after a criminal conviction, the voting rights of members of the armed services and U.S. citizens living overseas, and information related to post-election audits, including the requirements under federal law that state and local election officials \u201cretain and preserve\u201d voting-related records.\n\nMore information about voting and elections is available on the Justice Department\u2019s website at www.justice.gov/voting. Learn more about the Voting Rights Act and other federal voting laws at www.justice.gov/crt/voting-section. Complaints about possible violations of federal voting rights laws can be submitted through the Civil Rights Division\u2019s website at civilrights.justice.gov or by telephone at 1-800-253-3931.\n\nThe www.justice.gov/voting website also provides information on the Justice Department\u2019s Election Threats Task Force, which leads the department\u2019s efforts to address violence against election workers and to ensure that all election workers \u2014 whether elected, appointed or volunteer \u2014 are able to do their jobs free from threats and intimidation.\n\nYou can report suspected criminal activity regarding voting to the FBI at 1-800-CALL-FBI (1-800-225-5324) or by filing an online complaint at tips.fbi.gov. You can also contact local law enforcement. If at any time you are in imminent danger, call 911.",

        "text": "Is 2024 Really the Most Important Election in History?\nPresident Joe Biden and his anointed successor, Vice President Kamala Harris, have sought to lay them out in stark, simple terms. The election, Harris said at her rollout event as a presidential candidate on July 23, is \u201cabout two different visions for our nation: one where we are focused on the future, the other focused on the past.\u201d Biden, in a speech from the Oval Office a day later, sounded the same theme: \u201cAmerica is going to have to choose between moving forward or backward.\u201d\n\nWhat exactly are the stakes of the 2024 U.S. presidential election?\n\nPresident Joe Biden and his anointed successor, Vice President Kamala Harris, have sought to lay them out in stark, simple terms. The election, Harris said at her rollout event as a presidential candidate on July 23, is \u201cabout two different visions for our nation: one where we are focused on the future, the other focused on the past.\u201d Biden, in a speech from the Oval Office a day later, sounded the same theme: \u201cAmerica is going to have to choose between moving forward or backward.\u201d\n\nThese are, on the surface, fairly banal words, seemingly anodyne sentiments typical of presidential campaign rhetoric. Yet, in the present context, they are terrifyingly true. They are freighted with historic implications that could make this the most consequential election\u2014for both the United States and the world\u2014in U.S. history, historians and political experts say.\n\nWhy? Because the 2024 election is in large part about a candidate and the political party that he now controls\u2014Donald Trump and the Republican Party\u2014who want to move the country decidedly backward in time and who seek a return to an America and a world that no longer exist.\n\nThe imagined world of \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d\u2014Trump\u2019s enduring campaign theme\u2014seeks to roll back a century\u2019s worth of recognition and rights to the many Americans who are not white, male, heterosexual, and cisgender. It is a world that intends to curtail a half-century\u2019s worth of reproductive rights granted to women. It is a movement that aims to undo the progressive era dating back to the New Deal\u2014which raised the status of the working class\u2014and return to a kind of gilded age for billionaires, with an economic policy based on corporate tax cuts and tariffs. Finally, in foreign policy, this pseudo-nostalgic vision welcomes a return to the quasi-isolationism embraced by the Founding Fathers and seeks a full retreat from America\u2019s post-World War II role as globo-cop, or enforcer of last resort for global security.\n\nAll this is what the \u201cAgain\u201d in Make America Great Again, or MAGA, really means, said Joseph Ellis, a Pulitzer Prize-winning presidential historian. For Trump\u2019s huge MAGA political base, \u201cthe promised land lies somewhere in the first half of the twentieth century, when white male supremacy was still the presumed natural order,\u201d Ellis wrote in an email. \u201cThat means before Brown v. Board of Education integrated public education; before Martin Luther King had his dream; before Roe v. Wade gave women control of their bodies; before the Voting Rights Act; and, most symbolically, before an African American occupied the White House.\u201d When it comes to America\u2019s role in the world, MAGA means \u201cgoing back sometime before 1940,\u201d when isolationism dominated U.S. policy, Ellis said.\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s no surprise that for Harris\u2019s campaign, the rallying cry has become, \u201cWe\u2019re not going back!\u201d\n\nFor Trump and the Republicans, the way to achieve this broad retrograde vision\u2014to undo nearly a century\u2019s worth of progress\u2014is by taking power in the White House and both houses of Congress. And the only way to do that, in turn, is through the massive disenfranchisement of broad swaths of the fastest-growing portions of the U.S. population, such as Black and Hispanic people and especially immigrants. Thus, in the end, the \u201cexistential threat to democracy\u201d that Harris, Biden, and the Democrats are warning of is not hyperbole but rather what Trump and his supporters are actually pushing for, Ellis said. They seek to achieve this by all but halting immigration, curtailing voting rights for minorities, gerrymandering their shrinking white majority into a dominant position in as many legislative districts as they can, and asserting unlimited and unchecked power for the presidency.\n\nThe brutal fact, Ellis said in an interview, is that U.S. democracy is no longer working for the Republican Party as it\u2019s currently constituted\u2014and probably never will again given demographic trends. \u201cBy the year 2045 [white people] will become a statistical minority,\u201d he said, citing U.S. Census Bureau projections. \u201cThe Trump believers actually want to see democracy end, because it has come to mean white male supremacy will end.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump sits in a chair and gestures toward a reporter seated next to him. Behind them are U.S. flags on stands and screens bearing the logo of the NABJ.\n\nAre things really that dire? Based on the evidence, such fears can\u2019t be dismissed entirely.\n\nTrump has long denied he is a racist, but it\u2019s undeniable that his rise to national political prominence in the last decade\u2014culminating in his 2016 election as president\u2014has been fueled by dog whistling to white supremacists. In late July, after Trump suggested to a stunned audience at the National Association of Black Journalists Convention in Chicago that Harris, who is Black and South Asian, had \u201cturned Black\u201d for political purposes, commentators recalled similar attacks of his in the past. Indeed, Trump\u2019s political career was effectively built on his false, racist \u201cbirther\u201d claim that former President Barack Obama was not born in the United States. After repeating this baseless lie for a year, Trump went from nowhere in the polls to utter dominance of the Republican Party in 2016. Trump has also openly challenged the validity of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nTrump\u2019s supporters have been quite forthright about their back-to-the-future mindset. Trump has rhetorically disavowed the Heritage Foundation\u2019s controversial Project 2025\u2014a massive new Republican agenda\u2014but it was designed by some key officials from his presidency. These include Russell Vought, the policy director for the Republican National Convention\u2019s platform committee who is said to be in line to be Trump\u2019s next chief of staff. Several of these operatives told me in interviews last year that they want to roll back a century of left-wing encroachment on Washington, decimating what they view as a federal bureaucracy dominated by Black people and other minorities. They aim to reverse what began as Woodrow Wilson\u2019s creation of a federal administrative elite and later grew into a vast permanent bureaucracy\u2014the \u201cdeep state\u201d Trump sees as his primary enemy\u2014under Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal and Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s Great Society. As Heritage President Kevin Roberts put it to me in an interview: \u201cIt\u2019s like doing open-heart surgery on the administrative state. That\u2019s the part that\u2019s never been done before.\u201d\n\nAnd they want to give the president near-dictatorial powers to accomplish this, including personal control of the Justice Department so he can prosecute his political adversaries.\n\nIn an interview in September 2023, Vought told me that the key difference from the first Trump administration is that this time, they\u2019re prepared. With a detailed action plan in place\u2014and with heretics to his MAGA movement slated to be purged from government to an unprecedented degree\u2014Trump may be able to achieve far more than in his first term, when he was stymied by his own cabinet and that obstructive deep state. \u201cWe are preparing to be ready on day one,\u201d Vought said. \u201cWhatever is necessary to seize control of the administrative state is really our task.\u201d\n\nIn this, the Trumpers could be helped along by a conservative-dominated Supreme Court. In a monumental ruling in July, the court effectively gave the twice-impeached president near-total immunity for most criminal acts he might commit in office were he to return to power. Delivering a blistering dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor argued that \u201cthe President is now a king above the law\u201d and could be immune even from ordering the assassination of political rivals.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s so strange about that Supreme Court decision is that it actually creates a space where the president doesn\u2019t need to do anything anymore to justify his actions,\u201d said Edward Watts, a historian at the University of California, San Diego. \u201cFor example, you don\u2019t need to create a state of emergency to assassinate your rival.\u201d In ancient Rome, Watts said, \u201ceven the most tyrannical emperors had to create justification for killing people.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to America\u2019s place in the world, these plans also mean withdrawing\u2014at least to some degree\u2014from the rules-based international system. And it\u2019s important to note that for many Americans, some of these views have real appeal, especially the idea that the United States needs to shuffle off its globo-cop role, which has allowed European and Asia nations to free-ride under the U.S. defense umbrella.\n\nEven many mainstream academics welcome his more realist approach to NATO and the Russia-Ukraine war, though they have little use for Trump himself. (Trump has promised to end the war quickly, and he has suggested that he will throw out previous Western promises to bring Ukraine into NATO.) Many experts are wary that Biden and Harris, who embody the postwar internationalist consensus, are now in danger of sucking the United States into wars on three major fronts, pledging all at once to defend Ukraine against Russia \u201cno matter what,\u201d in Biden\u2019s words; Israel against Hamas and Iran; and Taiwan against China.\n\nTrump officials like to note that his more inward-looking approach goes back to George Washington himself, who warned Americans in his farewell address as president \u201cto steer clear of permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world\u201d and to maintain their \u201cdetached and distant situation\u201d behind protective oceans.\n\nDonald Trump, wearing a suit, stands alone on the far right. The flags of multiple other countries are on stands behind him at left.\n\nWhat would such a shift mean in practice? Based on the reporting I\u2019ve done in recent months, a second Trump administration would probably not simply pull out of NATO, as the former president has repeatedly suggested he might do. As Robert O\u2019Brien, a former Trump national security advisor, wrote in a recent Foreign Affairs cover article titled \u201cThe Return of Peace Through Strength,\u201d a second Trump administration would still value alliances. \u201c\u2018America first is not America alone\u2019 is a mantra often repeated by Trump administration officials,\u201d O\u2019Brien wrote. But a second Trump administration would also make so many demands of Europe to take over the lion\u2019s share of NATO defenses that a major\u2014and perhaps permanent\u2014rupture in the trans-Atlantic relationship is much more likely.\n\nThat would only continue a trend by which U.S. allies have come to realize that they can no longer rely on a superpower so unstable and internally polarized. In the run-up to the 2020 presidential election, former U.S. Ambassador to NATO Ivo Daalder told me, echoing many other policy experts, that contest would be the most important in U.S. history\u2014at least since the Civil War. Trump\u2019s reelection would be tantamount, Daalder said, to a formal divorce from Europe and the West.\n\nThat\u2019s doubly true this time around, Daalder says now. \u201cIf 2020 was the most important election since 1860, 2024 is the most important since 2020,\u201d Daalder said in an interview. \u201cThe fact that [Trump] picked J.D. Vance [as his running mate], whose foreign policy is more nationalist and isolationist even than Trump\u2019s, speaks volumes to the fact that this will be an administration in which there won\u2019t be anybody who adheres to the old framework that has guided American policy since 1941. You combine that with his anti-democratic tendencies\u2014it\u2019s clear this could be more dangerous than last time.\u201d\n\nOther foreign-policy experts agree. In fact, said Jonah Blank, a foreign affairs scholar who once worked on Biden\u2019s Senate staff, \u201cthis is a more important election than 2020 because now we know more about what we\u2019re getting. In his first term, the Trump-inspired insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 was yet to happen; the Supreme Court hadn\u2019t yet ruled on immunity.\u201d Except for Jan. 6, Blank said, \u201cjust looking at what he\u2019s said and done since then is more disturbing than anything he did in office.\u201d\n\nSmall headshots inside red circles of 11 of Donald Trumps foreign-policy advisors. Small headshots inside red circles of 11 of Donald Trumps foreign-policy advisors. Trump\u2019s Foreign-Policy Influencers Meet the 11 men whose worldviews are shaping the 2024 Republican ticket. Feature | FP Staff Insider | Decoding Trump\u2019s Foreign Policy By Ravi Agrawal\n\nJoseph S. Nye Jr., who is one of the most respected foreign affairs specialists in the United States (Read his letter to the next president in the Fall 2024 print issue here.), had a similar prediction when I interviewed him in 2020. If Trump continued to threaten to retake power, Nye said, then U.S. allies, especially in Europe, would eventually throw their hands up at the unpredictability of U.S. politics. He foresees grimmer tidings now.\n\n\u201cSelling out Ukraine will strengthen [Russian President Vladimir] Putin, and weaken the credibility of NATO,\u201d Nye wrote in an email. \u201cWithdrawing troops in [South] Korea or Japan will have a destabilizing effect on East Asia. And withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accord again will weaken international institutions, efforts to combat climate change, and hurt America\u2019s soft power. Add to this high tariffs and a trade war with our partners and you have a mess that could be transformative. And we will not have the moderating influence of traditional Republican appointees as we did in the earlier term.\u201d\n\nOne saving grace could be that Europeans\u2014weakened economically vis-\u00e0-vis the United States and threatened more than at any other time in the postwar period by both Russia and China under President Xi Jinping\u2014will have little choice in the end but to side with Washington, Trump or no Trump.\n\n\u201cIt will damage their trust in us, but as long as Putin and Xi remain in power, Trump\u2019s return will not destroy the alliances at their end,\u201d Nye said.\n\nAnother possible source of relief is that Trump has repeatedly said he would avoid getting the United States into a war. Indeed, one of his chief complaints against Biden is that, as Trump said during their ill-fated June 27 debate, \u201che will drive us into World War III\u201d because of his aggressive stance against Russia. Some national security experts agree that at a moment when the Biden administration has painted itself into a corner by fully backing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s quixotic aim of driving out the Russians altogether\u2014thus effectively delegating U.S. strategy to Zelensky\u2014Trump would at least bring a fresh approach. \u201cOne thing he\u2019ll do is de-stigmatize the idea that there could be negotiations,\u201d said Stephen Wertheim, a political scientist at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the author of the 2020 book, Tomorrow, the World: The Birth of U.S. Global Supremacy.\n\nEven critics such as Ellis say that on this issue, Trump may have \u201ca point that has an enormous amount of resonance in the American population right now. We can\u2019t be the savior for the world.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, however, a second President Trump would likely dramatically escalate tensions with China. While the Biden administration has pursued a policy of countering China without quite \u201ccontaining\u201d it\u2014maintaining Trump\u2019s tariff war while building new security structures, such the AUKUS partnership between Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States\u2014a second Trump administration would more openly embrace the idea that the United States is engaged in a new cold war with China. \u201cAs China seeks to undermine American economic and military strength, Washington should return the favor\u2014just as it did during the Cold War, when it worked to weaken the Soviet economy,\u201d O\u2019Brien wrote in his recent essay.\n\nThis would involve a dramatic escalation of the trade war and more than Biden\u2019s \u201cde-risking\u201d\u2014a full decoupling of the two economies. \u201cNow is the time to press even further, with a 60 percent tariff on Chinese goods, as Trump has advocated, and tougher export controls on any technology that might be of use to China,\u201d added O\u2019Brien, who also called for a crash military program to arm other nations, even Communist-led Vietnam, against China.\n\n\u201cThe [Navy] should also move one of its aircraft carriers from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and the Pentagon should consider deploying the entire Marine Corps to the Pacific, relieving it in particular of missions in the Middle East and North Africa,\u201d he wrote. O\u2019Brien contended that such moves would increase deterrence, preventing war, but a more forward-based U.S. posture could also increase the odds of a direct military conflict between Washington and Beijing.\n\nA big problem in divining what Trump would do in a second term is that his view of America\u2019s role in the world remains mostly incoherent, Wertheim said. \u201cHe\u2019s saying, \u2018On one hand, I want to dominate the world and when there\u2019s crisis almost anywhere that reflects badly on the U.S., I personally will put a stop to it. But on the other hand, I could take or leave most American alliances.\u2019\u201d\n\nKamala Harris puts her hand to her chest and looks up in front of a large crowd holding \"Freedom\" signs.\n\nIs Harris the one to deliver coherence to U.S. policy\u2014and to see that this grand unwinding of the world system doesn\u2019t happen? In the weeks since Biden stepped aside, the former California prosecutor and senator has surged in the polls. Most experts see little or no daylight between Harris and Biden in policy in that both have sought to find a bridge between the post-World War II era of bold liberal internationalism and the new era of populist neoprotectionism and anti-interventionism. Harris\u2019s running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz\u2014who has almost no international experience\u2014doesn\u2019t seem to change that calculation much.\n\nIn her speeches as vice president\u2014which have been little noted until now\u2014Harris has repeatedly sounded one theme: Any form of U.S. isolationism \u201cis dangerous, destabilizing, and indeed shortsighted,\u201d as she said at the 2024 Munich Security Conference. \u201cI firmly believe our commitment to build and sustain alliances has helped America become the most powerful and prosperous country in the world\u2014alliances that have prevented wars, defended freedom, and maintained stability from Europe to the Indo-Pacific. To put all of that at risk would be foolish,\u201d Harris said.\n\n\u201cIf she beats Trump, she will already have had a successful presidency in a way,\u201d Blank said. \u201cIt will be the first step toward averting a truly existential calamity. The stakes really are that large.\u201d\n\nPerhaps. Certainly that could prove to be the case for the Trumpist threat to U.S. democracy. And if U.S. democracy is destroyed or vitiated, that heightens the threat to democracies around the world.\n\nBut it\u2019s also worth noting that on some key issues related to America\u2019s place in the world\u2014trade, immigration, neoprotectionism, and the new \u201cmake it in America\u201d embrace of industrial policy that has overtaken both political parties\u2014the Trump-Vance and Harris-Walz tickets don\u2019t differ as much as the harsh political rhetoric would sometimes indicate. It\u2019s notable that Trump and Biden were equally eager to pull out of Afghanistan. During their June 27 debate, Trump attacked Biden for the disastrous way the United States left the country in 2021, but it was Trump who laid the groundwork by sidelining the Afghan government and negotiating directly with the Taliban. That all but ensured the ultimate disaster involving a rapid takeover by the Taliban after 20 years of U.S. occupation.\n\nMoreover, whoever inherits the White House next January will be forced by the anti-interventionist mood in the country to avoid putting U.S. boots on the ground anywhere in the world. He or she will face the same titanic diplomatic challenges\u2014both in Ukraine and in the Middle East\u2014and will be leery of getting pulled into any further foreign crises. He or she will be equally forced to maintain U.S. deterrence in Europe and Asia\u2014and to face down Putin and Xi, who have more or less joined together to try to eclipse U.S. hegemony.\n\nSome senior officials who served in Trump\u2019s first term and remain loyal say he won\u2019t be as much of a threat to the international system as critics think. Among them is Kiron Skinner, the former head of policy planning under Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who noted in an interview that in his first term, Trump \u201cstayed within the United Nations, though we pulled back from some agencies. But there wasn\u2019t a pull away from the broad-based liberal international order.\u201d In his second term, Skinner said, Trump would mainly seek to \u201cright-size America\u2019s role in the world\u201d by demanding that U.S. allies step up more on defense.\n\nAll of which suggests that the forces of inertia\u2014or the status quo ante\u2014may prove stronger than people think.\n\n\u201cBetting on inertia in U.S. foreign policy is a very good bet,\u201d Wertheim said. \u201cIt\u2019s really, really hard to change U.S. foreign policy in a big way.\u201d\n\nSo, yes, the stakes of the 2024 election are big indeed. It\u2019s just that we don\u2019t know yet how big they will be.",

        "text": "Jimmy Carter excited to vote for Harris in 2024 presidential election, son says\nFormer President Jimmy Carter's grandson says that the Georgia politician is talking more about the presidential race as election day and his 100th birthday get closer.\n\nSpeaking to the Washington Post, James Earl \"Chip\" Carter III said the 39th president has been getting excited about the support he has been seeing for Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign.\n\nIt's been 18 months since Carter entered hospice, and the former president hasn't been seen outside of an appearance at the memorial service for Rosalynn Carter, his wife of 77 years.\n\nWhile Carter's health remains a day-to-day situation, his grandson said that he is talking more, enjoying his favorite treat of red velvet and caramel mini cupcakes, and following the latest changes in the 2024 presidential campaign.\n\nChip Carter said that his father spent part of Aug. 18 - Rosalynn's birthday - at her grave on their family farm.\n\n\"He was looking at her tombstone, and I started talking, and he told me to be quiet,\" Chip Carter said. \"No doubt he was praying, but he could have been just having a conversation with Mom,\" Chip Carter said.\n\nFormer U.S. President Jimmy Carter speaks to the congregation at Maranatha Baptist Church before teaching Sunday school in his hometown of Plains, Georgia on April 28, 2019.

It\u2019s just a birthday. He said he cared about voting for Kamala Harris,\" Chip Carter said.\n\nCarter also voted in May's primary election and can't wait to cast his mail-in ballot next month, his family said. Despite his health complications over the last few years, politics has remained an important part of his life.\n\nWhen he's not thinking about politics, the family says Carter has been watching baseball and keeping up with updates about the family farm and Habitat for Humanity.\n\nRELATED JIMMY CARTER STORIES\n\nJimmy Carter 100th birthday celebration plans\n\nMany believe that Mr. Carter will hang on until his 100th birthday, and plans have been made to celebrate the milestone.\n\nTickets are on sale for a musical celebration at the Fox Theatre in Atlanta. The concert will feature appearances by Chuck Leavell, D-Nice, Drive-By Truckers, Eric Church, GROUPLOVE, Maren Morris, The War And Treaty, and The Atlanta Symphony Orchestra Chamber Chorus. Emmy award-winner Rickey Minor will serve as the musical director, with appearances by celebrity guests such as Dale Murphy and Killer Mike. Additional artists and presenters will be announced in the coming weeks.\n\nRELATED: 'Jimmy Carter 100: A Celebration in Song' announced for Sept. 17 at Fox Theatre\n\nCarter will not be in attendance, according to the Carter Center. However, he is aware of the celebration, and they will ensure he sees photos and video from the musical celebration. Music has always been an important part of Carter's life, and he was known as the Rock 'n' Roll President.\n\nRELATED: Against All Odds: Jimmy Carter nears 100th birthday, plans underway\n\nOther planned events include a 100-mile community bicycle ride in his home county and a free film festival in Atlanta organized by the Jimmy Carter Presidential Library and Museum. The film festival will take place from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. on Sep. 28 and will feature some of Carter's favorite films.",

        "text": "Exclusive: 2024 US Presidential Election: Predictions are in!\nIn an exclusive interview with India Today Global, Professor Allan Jay Lichtman, known as the \"Nostradamus of US. elections,\" shared his valuable insights with Geeta Mohan about the upcoming 2024 US. presidential election. Lichtman, famous for his development of the \"Keys to the White House\" model, has maintained an impressive track record of accurately predicting election outcomes since 1984, with the notable exception of 2000.\n\nadvertisement\n\nLichtman\u2019s \"Keys to the White House\" model uses 13 true/false criteria to determine whether the incumbent party\u2019s presidential candidate is likely to win or lose the next election. This innovative approach has solidified Lichtman\u2019s reputation as a leading figure in political forecasting.\n\nKeys To The White House: The 13 Indicators\n\nIn assessing the likelihood of an incumbent party's success in a U.S. presidential election, several key indicators are typically considered. These factors provide insight into the political and economic landscape, as well as the candidates themselves.\n\n1. Party mandate: After the midterm elections, the incumbent party holds more seats in the U.S. House of Representatives than before.\n\n2. Contest: There is no serious primary contest for the incumbent party's nomination.\n\n3. Incumbency: The sitting president is running for re-election.\n\n4. Third party: No significant third-party or independent campaigns emerge.\n\n5. Short-term economy: The economy is stable, with no recession during the campaign.\n\n6. Long-term economy: Economic growth during the term matches or exceeds the growth of the previous two terms.\n\n7. Major policy change: The incumbent administration has enacted major national policy changes.\n\n8. No social unrest: There is no widespread social unrest during the term.\n\n9. No scandal: The administration is free of any major scandals.\n\n10. No foreign or military failure: The administration has avoided significant failures in foreign or military affairs.\n\n11. Major foreign or military success: It has also achieved major success in foreign or military affairs.\n\n12. Charismatic incumbent: The incumbent candidate is charismatic or a national hero.\n\n13. Challenger\u2019s charisma: The challenging candidate lacks charisma or similar stature.\n\nThese conditions, when met, greatly enhance the incumbent party's prospects in the election.\n\n\n\nKamala Harris to be elected as president\n\nDiscussing Kamala Harris, Lichtman said, \u201cI'm predicting a woman president in 2024. That's great news. First woman president, first of South Asian and African American origin or first Indian and black woman. That's extraordinary. A woman of colour, both East Indian and African American Black.\u201d\n\nLichtman also addressed Donald Trump\u2019s criticism of Harris, stating, \u201cDonald Trump, of course, has totally blown away saying, oh, she suddenly turned black. What nonsense. She went to a historically black university. She joined a black sorority. She was a member of the Black Caucus in the Senate. Just a lie.\u201d\n\nInsights on the 2024 US Presidential Election\n\nOn the \"Keys to the White House\" system, which has been influential in predicting election outcomes, Lichtman explained, \u201cThe keys are always measured against the strength and performance of the incumbent party, whether the candidate is the sitting president or not. That's the big message of the keys that elections are based on the strength and performance of the White House party, not on the debates, the fundraising, the ads, the negative tricks.\u201d\n\nReflecting on the 2016 election, Lichtman added, \u201cBased on conventional analysis of the campaign, Hillary Clinton should have won going away in 2016. She won all the debates. She had more fundraising, more ads, a better organisation, and more experience. But I was virtually alone using the keys in predicting a Donald Trump victory.\u201d\n\nHe emphasized that his predictions work on an administration-by-administration basis, noting, \u201cWhy was that? Was that not also because of the baggage of being a part of the administration, which may be Kamala Harris also carries? Well, I only say this because your indicators and what your indicators are on the economy and on those counts, you would have people looking at, uh, performance of the Biden administration as they did, um, the Obama administration. It's not the Obama administration. Another message of the keys is it works administration by administration.\u201d\n\nResponding to Critics\n\nadvertisement\n\nDespite his notable success, Lichtman faces criticism from academics and journalists regarding his methods. He responded, \u201cI also get some academics and journalists criticising me, and my answer is, look at my record. You can't make up a 40-year record. Plus, you know, show me where you've done successful predictions. And none of them have, of course. So I quote the great philosopher Wittgenstein and say of that which thou canst not speak, let thou remain silent.\u201d\n\nDebunking theories and systems of pollsters and electoral pundits Lichtman said, \u201cI share my predictions very broadly. And when I first came up with my system and began predicting, I got blasted by the professional forecasters because they claimed I committed the cardinal sin of subjectivity. My indicators were not cut and dry, and I explained, \"no, these are judgmental indicators.\u201d\n\nadvertisement\n\nLichtman elaborated on the development of his method, saying, \u201cThey're very carefully defined, and they've been answered for well over 100 years. It took about 15 to 20 years. And then the professional forecasting community totally turned around and they realised their big, fancy, purely statistical models didn't work. And the best model was one like mine that combines statistical and judgmental indicators. And suddenly the keys to the White House were the hottest thing in prediction. I twice was the keynote speaker at the International Forecasting Summit.\u201d\n\nOn the Inception of the Keys\n\nLichtman detailed the empirical foundation of his model, stating, \u201cIt's an empirical result. It's not something I just made up. And we did it in 1981 with my collaborator Borok. And empirically, we looked at every election from 1860 to 1980. We had one so-called vector, one column with wins and losers and another column with a whole set of different kinds of questions, not just the 13. And using pattern recognition, we discovered that the best set of yes-no questions that could distinguish between stability and earthquake in 120 years of politics were these 13 keys and the six keys and you're out decision rule. So this was something we discovered through research, not something we just concocted off the top of our heads. If we had done that, we would have been, you know, wrong a lot of times.\u201d\n\nadvertisement\n\nPolls Are Unreliable\n\nLichtman voiced his scepticism about polls, stating, \u201cDon't rely on polls. Don't rely on talking to people since, as I said, they can change their minds. Who knows what they're going to tell you. You can't talk to enough people to get any reliable results. So I look at the fundamentals of how elections really work, and I'm really unique in that regard.\u201d\n\nHe further criticised polling accuracy, adding, \u201cThey're not predictors. And the error margin of polls is much greater than the pollsters would tell you. They tell you it's plus and minus 3% approximately. But that's pure statistical error. That doesn't take into account all the other errors of people not responding, people lying, people not having focus on the election and changing their minds. And, of course, they don't know who's voting, so they have to guess at the likely voters. So the error margin of polls is much greater than plus and minus 3%. And it's not random. It's unidirectional.\u201d\n\nHe concluded, \u201cThe polls underestimated Republican voting strength in 2016. But based on recent elections, they're underestimating Democratic voting strength.\u201d\n\nAllan Jay Lichtman\u2019s insights provide a compelling perspective on U.S. elections and the future of American politics. His \"Keys to the White House\" model, grounded in empirical research and historical analysis, offers a robust framework for understanding electoral outcomes beyond the limitations of traditional polling methods. Lichtman\u2019s approach emphasises the importance of evaluating the incumbent party\u2019s performance, presenting a unique and thoughtful perspective on predicting presidential elections.",

        "text": "Democratic Party Still Seen as Better for Union Members\nWASHINGTON, D.C. -- As Donald Trump and Kamala Harris continue to court labor union voters, Americans are much more likely to say the Democratic Party best serves the interests of union members (62%) than to say the Republican Party does (27%).\n\nGallup previously asked the question about which party best serves labor union members in 1981, 1984 and 1990, and the Democratic Party held double-digit advantages over the GOP in all of the readings. The latest 35-percentage-point gap between the parties is similar to the gaps in 1990 and 1984 but 10 points lower than in 1981, when the Democratic Party held a 45-point advantage on serving union members.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nThese findings are from Gallup\u2019s Aug. 1-20 poll, completed almost entirely between the July 15-18 Republican and Aug. 19-22 Democratic National Conventions, which both featured high-profile labor union speakers. The labor union voting bloc is particularly important in Pennsylvania, Nevada and Michigan, swing states where the shares of union members are higher than the national average.\n\nMost Democrats (88%) and a majority of independents (59%) believe the Democratic Party best serves union members, while 51% of Republicans think their own party does. Seven in 10 adults who either are a union member or live with someone who is choose the Democrats as best (71%), but so do six in 10 adults living in non-union households (61%).\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nLabor union voters typically have been more likely to vote for Democratic than Republican candidates for president, but to varying degrees. In 2020, 56% of voters in labor union households voted for Joe Biden and 40% backed Trump, while Trump won 43% of the union vote in 2016 against Hillary Clinton, who received 51%.\n\nAmericans Continue to Broadly Approve of Labor Unions\n\nSeven in 10 Americans currently approve of labor unions, essentially tying the 71% reading in 2022 that was the highest since 1965. Gallup first measured the public\u2019s approval of labor unions in 1936 and found the highest support (75%) in the 1950s. Approval of unions has only fallen below 50% once -- a 48% reading in 2009 after the Great Recession. The latest reading, 70%, marks the eighth consecutive reading above 60%, the longest streak at this level since the 1960s.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nPartisans\u2019 approval of labor unions continues to differ, with Democrats more supportive than Republicans and independents falling between the two groups. Democrats\u2019 latest approval of 94% is the highest it has been in the past quarter century and is up six points since last year. At the same time, Republicans' (49%) and independents' (67%) approval is essentially unchanged.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nDemocrats Also Hold Edge on Immigrants, LGBTQ+ People, Women, People of Color\n\nThe same poll measured which party Americans think best serves the interests of several other societal groups. In addition to labor unions, majorities say the Democratic Party best serves recent immigrants to the U.S. (both those who entered legally and illegally), LGBTQ+ people, women, Hispanic people, poor people, Black people, and parents of minor children.\n\nMeanwhile, Americans view the Republican Party as better than the Democratic Party when it comes to the interests of wealthy people (70%), business and professional people (67%), and military veterans (52%).\n\nThe public is evenly split on which political party is best for retirees and small business owners.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nMajorities of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents believe that the Democratic Party best serves the interests of all groups except for two:\n\nThe broad majority of Democrats, 86%, think the Republican Party is better than their own for serving wealthy people.\n\nDemocrats are evenly split in their views of the better party for business and professional people, with 47% each choosing the Democratic Party and the Republican Party.\n\nMajorities of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents think the Republican Party serves all of the societal groups better except for three:\n\nMore than four in five Republicans, 84%, say the Democratic Party better serves recent immigrants to the U.S. who arrived illegally.\n\nAbout seven in 10 Republicans think the opposing party better serves LGBTQ+ people.\n\nLess than half of Republicans, 49%, say their party is better for labor union members, while 41% think the Democratic Party is.\n\nGallup measured Americans\u2019 views on which party best serves several of these societal groups in the 1980s and 1990 -- business and professional people, poor people, wealthy people, retired people, women, small business people, Black people and labor union members. A comparison of the latest data and the 1990 data among partisans shows Democrats and Republicans are now more likely to assert their own party\u2019s superiority with all of these groups except for wealthy people. Both Democrats and Republicans are now less likely than they were in 1990 to say their own party better serves the wealthy and more likely to say the opposing party does.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAmericans are more than twice as likely to believe the Democratic Party rather than the Republican Party best serves the interests of labor union members. And those perceptions have changed very little from the 1980s and 1990.\n\nTo stay up to date with the latest Gallup News insights and updates, follow us on X @Gallup.\n\nLearn more about how the Gallup Poll Social Series works.\n\nView complete question responses and trends (PDF download).\n\n###Embeddable###",

        "summary": " Vice President Kamala Harris has gone from sitting in the vice presidential residence to being on the cusp of the White House in just over a month . Former President Donald Trump will carry the banner of the Republican Party into the general election on the back of 88 criminal indictments against him .",
        "text": "Who are the presidential candidates in 2024?\nElection Day 2024 will be here in just two months, and a once-crowded presidential field has now narrowed to its final contestants. Here is a list of candidates on all sides of the aisle, though expect to see more names drop off as the race progresses.\n\nKamala Harris (D)\n\nIn what is perhaps one of the quickest rises to the nomination in U.S. history, Vice President Kamala Harris has gone from sitting in the vice presidential residence to being on the cusp of the White House in just over a month. Harris took up the mantle of the Democratic Party after President Joe Biden announced he was dropping out of the presidential race on July 21. \"There are some people who think we should be a country of chaos, of fear, of hate. But us, we choose something different,\" Harris said in her campaign announcement video . In the first six weeks of her campaign, Harris \"eclipsed the enthusiasm gap with the GOP and narrowed Trump's advantage on handling the economy and immigration,\" said USA Today . But almost every poll that has Harris in the lead also has her and Trump within the margin of error, meaning that a toss-up to the finish line is the most likely scenario come Election Day.\n\nDonald Trump (R)\n\nMonths before his legal fortunes took a turn for the worse, former President Donald Trump stood before an adoring crowd at his Mar-a-Lago estate and made his third consecutive run for president official. \"For millions of Americans, the past two years under Joe Biden have been a time of pain, hardship, anxiety, and despair,\" he told the room full of Republican aides and heavyweights. \"In order to make America great and glorious again, I am tonight announcing my candidacy for president of the United States.\"\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Trump will carry the banner of the Republican Party into the general election on the back of 88 criminal indictments against him, and has since attempted to turn his attention to finding a suitable line of attack to use against Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.\n\nCornel West (I)\n\nPhilosopher, scholar and activist Cornel West raised the perennial debate over third-party spoilers when he announced a run for president alongside the People's Party, then the Green Party, and now as an independent. \"People are hungry for change,\" West wrote on X when announcing his switch to run as an independent. \"They want good policies over partisan politics. We need to break the grip of the duopoly and give power to the people.\"\n\nHowever, his run as an independent means West is unlikely to travel very far in his presidential aspirations. He has recently been using the events of the Israel-Hamas war as a catalyst to draw in Muslim and Arab American voters, many of whom have become disillusioned with the Biden administration's response to the war.\n\nJill Stein (G)\n\nThe Green Party has rarely had luck at the national level, but they will try again with Jill Stein, who is the party's presidential nominee for the third time. Stein was previously nominated by the Green Party in 2012 and 2016. Her longshot candidacy has been met with different reactions on both sides of the aisle. Many Republicans are working to \"prop up third-party candidates\" who could \"offer liberal voters an alternative that could siphon away support from Vice President Kamala Harris,\" said The Associated Press . Democrats, however, have mostly reacted to Stein's candidacy negatively; Stein is a \"useful idiot for Russia. After parroting Kremlin talking points and being propped up by bad actors in 2016 she\u2019s at it again,\" DNC spokesperson Matt Corridoni said in a statement to The Bulwark .\n\nChase Oliver (L)\n\nChase Oliver , a libertarian, announced his candidacy in April 2023, per Ballotpedia . Speaking at the Iowa State Fair, the 2022 U.S. Senate candidate out of Georgia described himself as \"armed and gay,\" and urged a \"cultural war ceasefire,\" per the Des Moines Register . \"I don't care how you live, who you love, how you worship, how you express yourself, if you do it in peace, that's your business, not the government's,\" he said. Oliver is also pro-choice, supports the legalization of marijuana, and wants to see an increased focus on combating addiction and drug use in the U.S. Like Williamson, his odds of winning are so low that they are not displayed on Oddschecker.\n\nDropped out\n\nJoe Biden (D), 46th president of the United States: dropped out of the race in July 2024 after a poor debate performance against Trump that led to questions over his mental acuity. This makes Biden the first sitting president since 1968 not to seek reelection.\n\nMarianne Williamson (D), author and political activist: dropped out of the race in July 2024 for a second time; she previously dropped out in February 2024 but unsuspended her campaign weeks later.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. (I), environmental lawyer and activist: dropped out of the race in August 2024 and endorsed Donald Trump .\n\nWill Hurd (R), former congressman from Texas: dropped out of the race in October 2023 and endorsed Nikki Haley.\n\nFrancis Suarez (R), mayor of Miami, Florida: dropped out of the race in August 2023 after promising to do so after failing to secure a spot in the first GOP debate.\n\nLarry Elder (R), conservative political commentator and radio host: dropped out of the race in October 2023 and endorsed Donald Trump.\n\nPerry Johnson (R), businessman and former gubernatorial candidate: dropped out of the race in October 2023 and endorsed Donald Trump.\n\nMike Pence (R), former vice president: dropped out of the race in October 2023, saying it was \"not my time.\"\n\nTim Scott (R), South Carolina senator: dropped out of the race in November 2023 during a surprise announcement on Fox News.\n\nCorey Stapleton (R), former Montana secretary of state: dropped out of the race in October 2023.\n\nDoug Burgum (R), governor of North Dakota: dropped out of the race in December 2023 and endorsed Donald Trump.\n\nChris Christie (R), former New Jersey governor: dropped out of the race in January 2024 and said he would not \"enable Donald Trump to ever be president of the United States again.\"\n\nAsa Hutchinson (R), former Arkansas governor: dropped out of the race in January 2024 after getting less than 200 votes in the Iowa caucuses.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy (R), businessman and entrepreneur: dropped out of the race in January 2024 after a poor performance in the Iowa caucuses and endorsed Donald Trump.\n\nRon DeSantis (R), governor of Florida: dropped out of the race in January 2024 after a poor performance in the Iowa caucuses and endorsed Donald Trump.\n\nNikki Haley (R), former South Carolina governor and U.N. ambassador: dropped out of the race in March 2024 after a resounding defeat to Trump on Super Tuesday.\n\nRyan Binkley (R), pastor and entrepreneur from Texas: dropped out of the race in February 2024 and endorsed Donald Trump.",

Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\n\nBelow is a partial transcript of the exchange between Trump and Harris while the debate was ongoing.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Tonight, the high-stakes showdown here in Philadelphia between Vice President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump. Their first face-to-face meeting in this presidential election. Their first face-to-face meeting ever.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: A historic race for president upended just weeks ago. President Biden withdrawing after his last debate. Donald Trump is now up against a new opponent.\n\nDAVID MUIR: The candidates separated by the smallest of margins. Essentially tied in the polls nationally. And in the key battlegrounds, including right here in Pennsylvania, all still very much in play. The ABC News Presidential Debate starts right now.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Good evening, I'm David Muir. And thank you for joining us for tonight's ABC News Presidential Debate. We want to welcome viewers watching on ABC and around the world tonight. Vice President Kamala Harris and President Donald Trump are just moments away from taking the stage in this unprecedented race for president.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: And I'm Linsey Davis. Tonight's meeting could be the most consequential event of their campaigns, with Election Day now less than two months away. For Vice President Kamala Harris, this is her first debate since President Biden withdrew from the race on July 21st. Of course, that decision followed his debate against President Donald Trump in June. Since then, this race has taken on an entirely new dynamic.\n\nDAVID MUIR: And that brings us to the rules of tonight's debate: 90 minutes with two commercial breaks. No topics or questions have been shared with the campaigns. The candidates will have two minutes to answer questions. And this is the clock. That's what they'll be seeing. Two minutes for rebuttals and one minute for follow-ups, clarifications or responses. Their microphones will only be turned on when it's their turn to speak. No prewritten notes allowed. There is no audience here tonight in this hall at the National Constitution Center. This is an intimate setting for two candidates who have never met.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: President Trump won the coin toss. He chose to deliver the final closing statement of the evening. Vice President Harris selected the podium to the right.\n\nDAVID MUIR: So let's now welcome the candidates to the stage. Vice President Kamala Harris and President Donald Trump.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Kamala Harris. Let's have a good debate.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Nice to see you. Have fun.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Thank you.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Thank you.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Welcome to you both. It's wonderful to have you. It's an honor to have you both here tonight.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: Good evening, we are looking forward to a spirited and thoughtful debate.\n\nDAVID MUIR: So let's get started. I want to begin tonight with the issue voters repeatedly say is their number one issue, and that is the economy and the cost of living in this country. Vice President Harris, you and President Trump were elected four years ago and your opponent on the stage here tonight often asks his supporters, are you better off than you were four years ago? When it comes to the economy, do you believe Americans are better off than they were four years ago?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: So, I was raised as a middle-class kid. And I am actually the only person on this stage who has a plan that is about lifting up the middle class and working people of America. I believe in the ambition, the aspirations, the dreams of the American people. And that is why I imagine and have actually a plan to build what I call an opportunity economy. Because here's the thing. We know that we have a shortage of homes and housing, and the cost of housing is too expensive for far too many people. We know that young families need support to raise their children. And I intend on extending a tax cut for those families of $6,000, which is the largest child tax credit that we have given in a long time. So that those young families can afford to buy a crib, buy a car seat, buy clothes for their children. My passion, one of them, is small businesses. I was actually -- my mother raised my sister and me but there was a woman who helped raise us. We call her our second mother. She was a small business owner. I love our small businesses. My plan is to give a $50,000 tax deduction to start-up small businesses, knowing they are part of the backbone of America's economy. My opponent, on the other hand, his plan is to do what he has done before, which is to provide a tax cut for billionaires and big corporations, which will result in $5 trillion to America's deficit. My opponent has a plan that I call the Trump sales tax, which would be a 20% tax on everyday goods that you rely on to get through the month. Economists have said that Trump's sales tax would actually result for middle-class families in about $4,000 more a year because of his policies and his ideas about what should be the backs of middle-class people paying for tax cuts for billionaires.\n\nDAVID MUIR: President Trump, I'll give you two minutes.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: First of all, I have no sales tax. That's an incorrect statement. She knows that. We're doing tariffs on other countries. Other countries are going to finally, after 75 years, pay us back for all that we've done for the world. And the tariff will be substantial in some cases. I took in billions and billions of dollars, as you know, from China. In fact, they never took the tariff off because it was so much money, they can't. It would totally destroy everything that they've set out to do. They've taken in billions of dollars from China and other places. They've left the tariffs on. When I had it, I had tariffs and yet I had no inflation. Look, we've had a terrible economy because inflation has -- which is really known as a country buster. It breaks up countries. We have inflation like very few people have ever seen before. Probably the worst in our nation's history. We were at 21%. But that's being generous because many things are 50, 60, 70, and 80% higher than they were just a few years ago. This has been a disaster for people, for the middle class, but for every class. On top of that, we have millions of people pouring into our country from prisons and jails, from mental institutions and insane asylums. And they're coming in and they're taking jobs that are occupied right now by African Americans and Hispanics and also unions. Unions are going to be affected very soon. And you see what's happening. You see what's happening with towns throughout the United States. You look at Springfield, Ohio. You look at Aurora in Colorado. They are taking over the towns. They're taking over buildings. They're going in violently. These are the people that she and Biden let into our country. And they're destroying our country. They're dangerous. They're at the highest level of criminality. And we have to get them out. We have to get them out fast. I created one of the greatest economies in the history of our country. I'll do it again and even better.\n\nDAVID MUIR: We are going to get to immigration and border security during this debate. But I would like to let Vice President Harris respond on the economy here.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Well, I would love to. Let's talk about what Donald Trump left us. Donald Trump left us the worst unemployment since the Great Depression. Donald Trump left us the worst public health epidemic in a century. Donald Trump left us the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War. And what we have done is clean up Donald Trump's mess. What we have done and what I intend to do is build on what we know are the aspirations and the hopes of the American people. But I'm going to tell you all, in this debate tonight, you're going to hear from the same old, tired playbook, a bunch of lies, grievances and name-calling. What you're going to hear tonight is a detailed and dangerous plan called Project 2025 that the former president intends on implementing if he were elected again. I believe very strongly that the American people want a president who understands the importance of bringing us together knowing we have so much more in common than what separates us. And I pledge to you to be a president for all Americans.\n\nDAVID MUIR: President Trump, I'll give you a minute here to respond.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Number one, I have nothing to do, as you know and as she knows better than anyone, I have nothing to do with Project 2025. That's out there. I haven't read it. I don't want to read it, purposely. I'm not going to read it. This was a group of people that got together, they came up with some ideas. I guess some good, some bad. But it makes no difference. I have nothing to do -- everybody knows I'm an open book. Everybody knows what I'm going to do. Cut taxes very substantially. And create a great economy like I did before. We had the greatest economy. We got hit with a pandemic. And the pandemic was, not since 1917 where 100 million people died has there been anything like it? We did a phenomenal job with the pandemic. We handed them over a country where the economy and where the stock market was higher than it was before the pandemic came in. Nobody's ever seen anything like it. We made ventilators for the entire world. We got gowns. We got masks. We did things that nobody thought possible. And people give me credit for rebuilding the military. They give me credit for a lot of things. But not enough credit for the great job we did with the pandemic. But the only jobs they got were bounce-back jobs. These were jobs, bounce back. And it bounced back and it went to their benefit. But I was the one that created them. They know it and so does everybody else.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Vice President Harris, I'll let you respond.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: So, Donald Trump has no plan for you. And when you look at his economic plan, it's all about tax breaks for the richest people. I am offering what I describe as an opportunity economy, and the best economists in our country, if not the world, have reviewed our relative plans for the future of America. What Goldman Sachs has said is that Donald Trump's plan would make the economy worse. Mine would strengthen the economy. What the Wharton School has said is Donald Trump's plan would actually explode the deficit. Sixteen Nobel laureates have described his economic plan as something that would increase inflation and by the middle of next year would invite a recession. You just have to look at where we are and where we stand on the issues. And I'd invite you to know that Donald Trump actually has no plan for you, because he is more interested in defending himself than he is in looking out for you.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: That's just a sound bite. They gave her that to say. Look, I went to the Wharton School of Finance and many of those professors, the top professors, think my plan is a brilliant plan, it's a great plan. It's a plan that's going to bring up our worth, our value as a country. It's going to make people want to be able to go and work and create jobs and create a lot of good, solid money for our -- for our country. And just to finish off, she doesn't have a plan. She copied Biden's plan. And it's like four sentences, like run-Spot-run. Four sentences that are just oh, we'll try and lower taxes. She doesn't have a plan. Take a look at her plan. She doesn't have a plan.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Mr. President, I do want to drill down on something you both brought up. The vice president brought up your tariffs you responded and let's drill down on this because your plan is what she calls is a essentially a national sales tax. Your proposal calls for tariffs as you pointed out here, on foreign imports across the board. You recently said that you might double your plan, imposing tariffs up to 20% on good coming into this country. As you know many economists say that with tariffs at that level costs are then passed onto the consumer. Vice President Harris has argued it'll mean higher prices on gas, food, clothing medication arguing it costs the typical family nearly four thousand dollars a year. Do you believe Americans can afford higher prices because of tariffs.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They aren't gonna have higher prices what's gonna have and who's gonna have higher prices is China and all of the countries that have been ripping us off for years. I charge, I was the only president ever China was paying us hundreds of billions of dollars and so were other countries and you know if she doesn't like 'em they should have gone out and they should have immediately cut the tariffs but those tariffs are there three and a half years now under their administration. We are gonna take in billions of dollars, hundreds of billions of dollars. I had no inflation, virtually no inflation, they had the highest inflation, perhaps in the history of our country because I've never seen a worse period of time. People can't go out and buy cereal bacon or eggs or anything else. These the people of our country are absolutely dying with what they've done. They've destroyed the economy and all you have to do it look at a poll. The polls say 80 and 85 and even 90% that the Trump economy was great that their economy was terrible.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Vice President Harris I do want to ask for your response and you heard what the president said there because the Biden administration did keep a number of the Trump tariffs in place so how do you respond?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Well, let's be clear that the Trump administration resulted in a trade deficit, one of the highest we've ever seen in the history of America. He invited trade wars, you wanna talk about his deal with China what he ended up doing is under Donald Trump's presidency he ended up selling American chips to China to help them improve and modernize their military basically sold us out when a policy about China should be in making sure the United States of America wins the competition for the 21st century. Which means focusing on the details of what that requires, focusing on relationships with our allies, focusing on investing in American based technology so that we win the race on A.I. and quantum computing, focusing on what we need to do to support America's workforce, so that we don't end up having the on the short end of the stick in terms of workers' rights. But what Donald Trump did let's talk about this with COVID, is he actually thanked President XI for what he did during COVID. Look at his tweet. \"Thank you, President XI,\" exclamation point. When we know that XI was responsible for lacking and not giving us transparency about the origins of COVID.\n\nDAVID MUIR: President Trump, I'll let you respond.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: First of all, they bought their chips from Taiwan. We hardly make chips anymore because of philosophies like they have and policies like they have. I don't say her because she has no policy. Everything that she believed three years ago and four years ago is out the window. She's going to my philosophy now. In fact, I was going to send her a MAGA hat. She's gone to my philosophy. But if she ever got elected, she'd change it. And it will be the end of our country. She's a Marxist. Everybody knows she's a Marxist. Her father's a Marxist professor in economics. And he taught her well. But when you look at what she's done to our country and when you look at these millions and millions of people that are pouring into our country monthly where it's I believe 21 million people, not the 15 that people say, and I think it's a lot higher than the 21. That's bigger than New York state. Pouring in. And just look at what they're doing to our country. They're criminals. Many of these people coming in are criminals. And that's bad for our economy too. You mentioned before, we'll talk about immigration later.\n\nWell, bad immigration is the worst thing that can happen to our economy. They have and she has destroyed our country with policy that's insane. Almost policy that you'd say they have to hate our country.\n\nDAVID MUIR: President Trump, thank you. Linsey?\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: I want to turn to the issue of abortion. President Trump, you've often touted that you were able to kill Roe v. Wade. Last year, you said that you were proud to be the most pro-life president in American history. Then last month you said that your administration would be great for women and their reproductive rights. In your home state of Florida, you surprised many with regard to your six-week abortion ban because you initially had said that it was too short and you said, \"I'm going to be voting that we need more than six weeks.\" But then the very next day, you reversed course and said you would vote to support the six-week ban. Vice President Harris says that women shouldn't trust you on the issue of abortion because you've changed your position so many times. Therefore, why should they trust you?\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, the reason I'm doing that vote is because the plan is, as you know, the vote is, they have abortion in the ninth month. They even have, and you can look at the governor of West Virginia, the previous governor of West Virginia, not the current governor, who's doing an excellent job, but the governor before. He said the baby will be born and we will decide what to do with the baby. In other words, we'll execute the baby.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And that's why I did that, because that predominates. Because they're radical. The Democrats are radical in that. And her vice presidential pick, which I think was a horrible pick, by the way for our country, because he is really out of it. But her vice presidential pick says abortion in the ninth month is absolutely fine. He also says execution after birth, it's execution, no longer abortion, because the baby is born, is okay. And that's not okay with me. Hence the vote. But what I did is something for 52 years they've been trying to get Roe v. Wade into the states.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And through the genius and heart and strength of six supreme court justices we were able to do that. Now, I believe in the exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother. I believe strongly in it. Ronald Reagan did also. 85% of Republicans do. Exceptions. Very important. But we were able to get it. And now states are voting on it. And for the first time you're going to see -- look, this is an issue that's torn our country apart for 52 years. Every legal scholar, every Democrat, every Republican, liberal, conservative, they all wanted this issue to be brought back to the states where the people could vote. And that's what happened, happened. Now, Ohio, the vote was somewhat liberal. Kansas the vote was somewhat liberal. Much more liberal than people would have thought. But each individual state is voting. It's the vote of the people now. It's not tied up in the federal government. I did a great service in doing it. It took courage to do it. And the supreme court had great courage in doing it. And I give tremendous credit to those six justices.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: There is no state in this country where it is legal to kill a baby after it's born. Madam vice president, I want to get your response to President Trump.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Well, as I said, you're going to hear a bunch of lies. And that's not actually a surprising fact. Let's understand how we got here. Donald Trump hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade. And they did exactly as he intended. And now in over 20 states there are Trump abortion bans which make it criminal for a doctor or nurse to provide health care. In one state it provides prison for life. Trump abortion bans that make no exception even for rape and incest. Which understand what that means. A survivor of a crime, a violation to their body, does not have the right to make a decision about what happens to their body next. That is immoral. And one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government, and Donald Trump certainly, should not be telling a woman what to do with her body.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: I have talked with women around our country. You want to talk about this is what people wanted? Pregnant women who want to carry a pregnancy to term suffering from a miscarriage, being denied care in an emergency room because the health care providers are afraid they might go to jail and she's bleeding out in a car in the parking lot? She didn't want that. Her husband didn't want that. A 12 or 13-year-old survivor of incest being forced to carry a pregnancy to term? They don't want that. And I pledge to you when Congress passes a bill to put back in place the protections of Roe v. Wade as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. But understand, if Donald Trump were to be re-elected, he will sign a national abortion ban. Understand in his Project 2025 there would be a national abortion ban. Understand in his Project 2025 there would be a national abortion -- a monitor that would be monitoring your pregnancies, your miscarriages. I think the American people believe that certain freedoms, in particular the freedom to make decisions about one's own body, should not be made by the government.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: Thank you, Vice President Harris.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, there she goes again. It's a lie. I'm not signing a ban. And there's no reason to sign a ban. Because we've gotten what everybody wanted. Democrats, Republicans and everybody else and every legal scholar wanted it to be brought back into the states. And the states are voting. And it may take a little time, but for 52 years this issue has torn our country apart. And they've wanted it back in the states. And I did something that nobody thought was possible. The states are now voting. What she says is an absolute lie. And as far as the abortion ban, no, I'm not in favor of abortion ban. But it doesn't matter because this issue has now been taken over by the states.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: Would you veto a national abortion ban if it came to --\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I won't have to because again -- two things. Number one, she said she'll go back to congress. She'll never get the vote. It's impossible for her to get the vote. Especially now with a 50-50 --essentially 50-50 in both senate and the house. She's not going to get the vote. She can't get the vote. She won't even come close to it. So it's just talk. You know what it reminds me of? When they said they're going to get student loans terminated and it ended up being a total catastrophe. The student loans -- and then her I think probably her boss, if you call him a boss, he spends all his time on the beach, but look, her boss went out and said we'll do it again, we'll do it a different way. He went out, got rejected again by the supreme court. So all these students got taunted with this whole thing about -- this whole idea. And how unfair that would have been. Part of the reason they lost. To the millions and millions of people that had to pay off their student loans. They didn't get it for free. But they were saying -- it's the same way that they talked about that, that they talk about abortion.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: But if I could just get a yes or no. Because your running mate JD Vance has said that you would veto if it did come to your desk.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I didn't discuss it with JD In all fairness. JD -- And I don't mind if he has a certain view but I think he was speaking for me but I really didn't. Look, we don't have to discuss it because she'd never be able to get it just like she couldn't get student loans. They couldn't get -- they didn't even come close to getting student loans. They didn't even come close to getting student loans. They taunted young people and a lot of other people that had loans. They can never get this approved. So it doesn't matter what she says about going to congress. Wonderful. Let's go to congress. Do it. But the fact is that for years they wanted to get it out of congress and out of the federal government and we did something that everybody said couldn't be done. And now you have a vote of the people on abortion.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: Vice President Harris, I want to give you your time to respond. But I do want to ask, would you support any restrictions on a woman's right to an abortion?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: I absolutely support reinstating the protections of Roe v. Wade. And as you rightly mentioned, nowhere in America is a woman carrying a pregnancy to term and asking for an abortion. That is not happening. It's insulting to the women of America. And understand what has been happening under Donald Trump's abortion bans. Couples who pray and dream of having a family are being denied IVF treatments. What is happening in our country, working people, working women who are working one or two jobs, who can barely afford childcare as it is, have to travel to another state to get on a plane sitting next to strangers, to go and get the health care she needs. Barely can afford to do it. And what you are putting her through is unconscionable. And the people of America have not -- the majority of Americans believe in a woman's right to make decisions about her own body. And that is why in every state where this issue has been on the ballot, in red and blue states both, the people of America have voted for freedom.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: Vice president Harris --\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Excuse me, I have to respond. Another lie. It's another lie. I have been a leader on IVF which is fertilization. The IVF -- I have been a leader. In fact, when they got a very negative decision on IVF from the Alabama courts, I saw the people of Alabama and the legislature two days later voted it in. I've been a leader on it. They know that and everybody else knows it. I have been a leader on fertilization, IVF. And the other thing, they -- you should ask, will she allow abortion in the eighth month, ninth month, seventh month?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Come on.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Would you do that? Why don't you ask her that question --\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Why don't you answer the question would you veto \u2013\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: That's the problem. Because under Roe v. Wade.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Answer the question, would you veto--\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You could do abortions in the seventh month, the eighth month, the ninth month -\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: That's not true.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And probably after birth. Just look at the governor, former governor of Virginia. The governor of Virginia said we put the baby aside and then we determine what we want to do with the baby.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: President Trump, thank you.\n\nDAVID MUIR: We're going to turn now to immigration and border security. We know it's an issue that's important to Republicans, Democrats, voters across the board in this country. Vice President Harris, you were tasked by President Biden with getting to the root causes of migration from Central America. We know that illegal border crossings reached a record high in the Biden administration. This past June, President Biden imposed tough new asylum restrictions. We know the numbers since then have dropped significantly. But my question to you tonight is why did the administration wait until six months before the election to act and would you have done anything differently from President Biden on this?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: So I'm the only person on this stage who has prosecuted transnational criminal organizations for the trafficking of guns, drugs, and human beings. And let me say that the United States Congress, including some of the most conservative members of the United States Senate, came up with a border security bill which I supported. And that bill would have put 1,500 more border agents on the border to help those folks who are working there right now over time trying to do their job. It would have allowed us to stem the flow of fentanyl coming into the United States. I know there are so many families watching tonight who have been personally affected by the surge of fentanyl in our country. That bill would have put more resources to allow us to prosecute transnational criminal organizations for trafficking in guns, drugs and human beings. But you know what happened to that bill? Donald Trump got on the phone, called up some folks in Congress, and said kill the bill. And you know why? Because he preferred to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem. And understand, this comes at a time where the people of our country actually need a leader who engages in solutions, who actually addresses the problems at hand. But what we have in the former president is someone who would prefer to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem. And I'll tell you something, he's going to talk about immigration a lot tonight even when it's not the subject that is being raised. And I'm going to actually do something really unusual and I'm going to invite you to attend one of Donald Trump's rallies because it's a really interesting thing to watch. You will see during the course of his rallies he talks about fictional characters like Hannibal Lecter. He will talk about windmills cause cancer. And what you will also notice is that people start leaving his rallies early out of exhaustion and boredom. And I will tell you the one thing you will not hear him talk about is you. You will not hear him talk about your needs, your dreams, and your, your desires. And I'll tell you, I believe you deserve a president who actually puts you first. And I pledge to you that I will.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Vice President Harris, thank you. President Trump, on that point I want to get your response.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I would like to respond.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Let me just ask, though, why did you try to kill that bill and successfully so? That would have put thousands of additional agents and officers on the border.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: First let me respond as to the rallies. She said people start leaving. People don't go to her rallies. There's no reason to go. And the people that do go, she's busing them in and paying them to be there. And then showing them in a different light. So, she can't talk about that. People don't leave my rallies. We have the biggest rallies, the most incredible rallies in the history of politics. That's because people want to take their country back. Our country is being lost. We're a failing nation. And it happened three and a half years ago. And what, what's going on here, you're going to end up in World War 3, just to go into another subject. What they have done to our country by allowing these millions and millions of people to come into our country. And look at what's happening to the towns all over the United States. And a lot of towns don't want to talk -- not going to be Aurora or Springfield. A lot of towns don't want to talk about it because they're so embarrassed by it. In Springfield, they're eating the dogs. The people that came in. They're eating the cats. They're eating -- they're eating the pets of the people that live there. And this is what's happening in our country. And it's a shame. As far as rallies are concerned, as far -- the reason they go is they like what I say. They want to bring our country back. They want to make America great again. It's a very simple phrase. Make America great again. She's destroying this country. And if she becomes president, this country doesn't have a chance of success. Not only success. We'll end up being Venezuela on steroids.\n\nDAVID MUIR: I just want to clarify here, you bring up Springfield, Ohio. And ABC News did reach out to the city manager there. He told us there have been no credible reports of specific claims of pets being harmed, injured or abused by individuals within the immigrant community --\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I've seen people on television\n\nDAVID MUIR: Let me just say here this ...\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The people on television say my dog was taken and used for food. So maybe he said that and maybe that's a good thing to say for a city manager.\n\nDAVID MUIR: I'm not taking this from television. I'm taking it from the city manager.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But the people on television say their dog was eaten by the people that went there.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Again, the Springfield city manager says there's no evidence of that.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We'll find out\n\nDAVID MUIR: Vice President Harris, I'll let you respond to the rest of what you heard.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Talk about extreme. Um, you know, this is I think one of the reasons why in this election I actually have the endorsement of 200 Republicans who have formally worked with President Bush, Mitt Romney, and John McCain including the endorsement of former Vice President Dick Cheney and Congressmember Liz Cheney. And if you want to really know the inside track on who the former president is, if he didn't make it clear already, just ask people who have worked with him. His former chief of staff, a four-star general, has said he has contempt for the constitution of the United States. His former national security adviser has said he is dangerous and unfit. His former secretary of defense has said the nation, the republic would never survive another Trump term. And when we listen to this kind of rhetoric, when the issues that affect the American people are not being addressed, I think the choice is clear in this election.\n\nDAVID MUIR: President Trump, I'll give you a quick minute to respond.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah. Thank you. Because when I hear that -- see, I'm a different kind of a person. I fired most of those people. Not so graciously. They did bad things or a bad job. I fired them. They never fired one person. They didn't fire anybody having to do with Afghanistan and the Taliban and the 13 people whose, whose, were just killed viciously and violently killed and I got to know the parents and the family. They should have fired all those generals, all those top people because that was one of the most incompetently handled situations anybody has ever seen. So when somebody does a bad job I fire them. And you take a guy like Esper. He was no good, I fired him. So he writes a book. Another one writes a book. Because with me they can write books. With nobody else can they. But they have done such a poor job. And they never fire anybody. Look at the economy. Look at the inflation. They didn't fire any of their economists. They have the same people. That's a good way not to have books written about you. But just to finish, I got more votes than any Republican in history by far. In fact, I got more votes than any president, sitting president in history by far.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Let me continue on immigration. It was what you wanted to talk about earlier. So let's get back to your deportation proposal that the vice president has reacted to as well. President Trump, you called this the largest domestic deportation operation in the history of our country. You say you would use the National Guard. You say if things get out of control you'd have no problem using the U.S. military.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: With local police.\n\nDAVID MUIR: You also said you would use local police. How would you deport 11 million undocumented immigrants? I know you believe that number is much higher. Take us through this. What does this look like? Will authorities be going door to door in this country?\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah. It is much higher because of them. They allowed criminals. Many, many, millions of criminals. They allowed terrorists. They allowed common street criminals. They allowed people to come in, drug dealers, to come into our country, and they're now in the United States. And told by their countries like Venezuela don't ever come back or we're going to kill you. Do you know that crime in Venezuela and crime in countries all over the world is way down? You know why? Because they've taken their criminals off the street and they've given them to her to put into our country. And this will be one of the greatest mistakes in history for them to allow -- and I think they probably did it because they think they're going to get votes. But it's not worth it. Because they're destroying the fabric of our country by what they've done. There's never been anything done like this at all. They've destroyed the fabric of our country. Millions of people let in. And all over the world crime is down. All over the world except here. Crime here is up and through the roof. Despite their fraudulent statements that they made. Crime in this country is through the roof. And we have a new form of crime. It's called migrant crime. And it's happening at levels that nobody thought possible.\n\nDAVID MUIR: President Trump, as you know, the FBI says overall violent crime is coming down in this country, but Vice President the...\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: use me, the FBI -- they were defrauding statements. They didn't include the worst cities. They didn't include the cities with the worst crime. It was a fraud. Just like their number of 818,000 jobs that they said they created turned out to be a fraud.\n\nDAVID MUIR: President Trump, thank you. I'll let you respond, Vice President Harris.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Well, I think this is so rich. Coming from someone who has been prosecuted for national security crimes, economic crimes, election interference, has been found liable for sexual assault and his next big court appearance is in November at his own criminal sentencing. And let's be clear where each person stands on the issue of what is important about respect for the rule of law and respect for law enforcement. The former vice president called for defunding, federal law enforcement, 45,000 agents, get this, on the day after he was arraigned on 34 felony counts. So let's talk about what is important in this race. It is important that we move forward, that we turn the page on this same old tired rhetoric. And address the needs of the American people, address what we\n\nneed to do about the housing shortage, which I have a plan for. Address what we must do to support our small businesses. Address bringing down the price of groceries. But frankly, the American people are exhausted with the same old tired playbook.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Vice President Harris, thank you.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Excuse me. Every one of those cases was started by them against their political opponent. And I'm winning most of them and I'll win the rest on appeal. And you saw that with the decision that came down just recently from the Supreme Court. I'm winning most of them. But those are cases, it's called weaponization. Never happened in this country. They weaponized the justice department. Every one of those cases was involved with the DOJ, from Atlanta and Fani Willis -- to the attorney general of New York and the D.A. In New York. Every one of those cases. And then they say oh, he was -- he's a criminal. They're the ones that made them go after me. By the way, Joe Biden was found essentially guilty on the documents case. And what happened in my documents case? They said oh, that's the toughest of them all. A complete and total victory. Two months ago it was thrown out. It's weaponization. And they used it. And it's never happened in this country. They used it to try and win an election. They're fake cases.\n\nDAVID MUIR: President Trump, thank you. A really quick response here, Vice President Harris, on this notion of weaponization of the justice department.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Well let's talk about extreme. And understand the context in which this election in 2024 is taking place. The United States Supreme Court recently ruled that the former president would essentially be immune from any misconduct if he were to enter the white house again. Understand, this is someone who has openly said he would terminate, I'm quoting, terminate the constitution of the United States. That he would weaponize the Department of Justice against his political enemies. Someone who has openly expressed disdain for members of our military. Understand what it would mean if Donald Trump were back in the white house with no guardrails. Because certainly, we know now the court won't stop him. We know JD Vance is not going to stop him. It's up to the American people to stop him.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Vice President Harris, thank you. Linsey?\n\nLINDSEY DAVIS: Vice President Harris, in your last run for president...\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: This is the one that weaponized. Not me. She weaponized. I probably took a bullet to the head because of the things that they say about me. They talk about democracy. I'm a threat to democracy. They're the threat to democracy \u2013 With the fake Russia Russia Russia investigation that went nowhere.\n\nDAVID MUIR: We have a lot to get to. Linsey?\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: Vice President Harris, in your last run for president you said you wanted to ban fracking. Now you don't. You wanted mandatory government buyback programs for assault weapons. Now your campaign says you don't. You supported decriminalizing border crossings. Now you're taking a harder line. I know you say that your values have not changed. So then why have so many of your policy positions changed?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: So my values have not changed. And I'm going to discuss every one -- at least every point that you've made. But in particular, let's talk about fracking because we're here in Pennsylvania. I made that very clear in 2020. I will not ban fracking. I have not banned fracking as Vice President of the United States. And, in fact, I was the tie-breaking vote on the Inflation Reduction Act, which opened new leases for fracking. My position is that we have got to invest in diverse sources of energy so we reduce our reliance on foreign oil. We have had the largest increase in domestic oil production in history because of an approach that recognizes that we cannot over rely on foreign oil. As it relates to my values, let me tell you, I grew up a middle-class kid raised by a hard-working mother who worked and saved and was able to buy our first home when I was a teenager. The values I bring to the importance of home ownership knowing not everybody got handed $400 million on a silver platter and then filed bankruptcy six times, is a value that I bring to my work to say we are going to work with the private sector and home builders to increase 3 million homes, increase by 3 million homes by the end of my first term. My work that is related to having a friend when I was in high school who was sexually assaulted by her stepfather. And my focus then, on protecting women and children from violent crime, is based on a value that is deeply grounded in the importance of standing up for those who are most vulnerable. My work that is about protecting social security and Medicare is based on long-standing work that I have done. Protecting seniors from scams. My values have not changed. And what is important is that there is a president who actually brings values and a perspective that is about lifting people up and not beating people down and name-calling. The true measure of the leader is the leader who actually understands that strength is not in beating people down, it's in lifting people up. I intend to be that president.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: President Trump, your response.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, first of all, I wasn't given $400 million. I wish I was. My father was a Brooklyn builder. Brooklyn, Queens. And a great father and I learned a lot from him. But I was given a fraction of that, a tiny fraction, and I built it into many, many billions of dollars. Many, many billions. And when people see it, they are even surprised. So, we don't have to talk about that. Fracking? She's been against it for 12 years. Uh, defund the police. She's been against that forever. She gave all that stuff up, very wrongly, very horribly. And everybody's laughing at it, okay? They're all laughing at it. She gave up at least 12 and probably 14 or 15 different policies. Like, she was big on defund the police.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: That's not true. [mouthed, not audible]\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: In Minnesota, she went out -- wait a minute. I'm talking now. If you don't mind. Please. Does that sound familiar?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Don't lie. [lie is audible]\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: She went out -- she went out in Minnesota and wanted to let criminals that killed people, that burned down Minneapolis, she went out and raised money to get them out of jail. She did things that nobody would ever think of. Now she wants to do transgender operations on illegal aliens that are in prison. This is a radical left liberal that would do this. She wants to confiscate your guns and she will never allow fracking in Pennsylvania. If she won the election, fracking in Pennsylvania will end on day one. Just to finish one thing, so important in my opinion, so, I got the oil business going like nobody has ever done before. They took, when they took over, they got rid of it, started getting rid of it, and the prices were going up the roof. They immediately let these guys go to where they were. I would have been five times, four times, five times higher because you're talking about 3 1/2 years ago. They got it up to where I was because they had no choice. Because the prices of energy were quadrupling and doubling. You saw what happened to gasoline. So, they said let's go back to Trump. But if she won the election, the day after that election, they'll go back to destroying our country and oil will be dead, fossil fuel will be dead. We'll go back to windmills and we'll go back to solar, where they need a whole desert to get some energy to come out. You ever see a solar plant? By the way, I'm a big fan of solar. But they take 400, 500 acres of desert soil--\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: President Trump--\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: These are not good things for the environment that she understands.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: President Trump, we have a lot of issues that we have to get to. We're out of time. Thank you.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Linsey, thank you. We have an election in just 56 days. I want to talk about the peaceful transfer of power, which of course we all know was a cornerstone of our democracy and the role of a president in a moment of crisis. Mr. President, on January 6th you told your supporters to march to the Capitol. You said you would be right there with them. The country and the world saw what played out at the Capitol that day. The officers coming under attack. Aides in the West Wing say you watched it unfold on television off the Oval Office. You did send out tweets, but it was more than two hours before you sent out that video message telling your supporters to go home. Is there anything you regret about what you did on that day?\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You just said a thing that isn't covered. Peacefully and patriotically, I said during my speech. Not later on. Peacefully and patriotically. And nobody on the other side was killed. Ashli Babbitt was shot by an out-of-control police officer that should have never, ever shot her. It's a disgrace. But we didn't do -- this group of people that have been treated so badly. I ask, what about all the people that are pouring into our country and killing people? That she allowed to pour in. She was the border czar. Remember that. She was the border czar. She doesn't want to be called the border czar because she's embarrassed by the border. In fact, she said at the beginning, I'm surprised you're not talking about the border yet. That's because she knows what a bad job they've done. What about those people? What's, when are they going to be prosecuted -- when are these people from countries all over the world, not just South America, they're coming in from all over the world, David, all over the world. And crime rates are down all over the world because of it --\n\nDAVID MUIR: But let me just ask you--\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But when are those, David, when are those people going to be prosecuted? When are the people that burned down Minneapolis going to be prosecuted or in Seattle? They went into Seattle, they took over a big percentage of the city of Seattle. When are those people going to be prosecuted?\n\nDAVID MUIR: But let me just ask you--\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You might ask her that question.\n\nDAVID MUIR: You were the president. You were watching it unfold on television. It's a very simple question as we move forward toward another election. Is there anything you regret about what you did on that day? Yes or no.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I had nothing to do with that other than they asked me to make a speech. I showed up for a speech. I said, I think it's going to be big. I went to Nancy Pelosi and the mayor of Washington, D.C. And the mayor put it back in writing, as you know. I said, you know, this is going to be a very big rally or whatever you want to call it. And again, it wasn't done by me. It was done by others. I said I'd like to give you 10,000 National Guard or soldiers. They rejected me. Nancy Pelosi rejected me. It was just two weeks ago, her daughter has a tape of her saying she is fully responsible for what happened. They want to get rid of that tape. It would have never happened if Nancy Pelosi and the mayor of Washington did their jobs. I wasn't responsible for security. Nancy Pelosi was responsible. She didn't do her job.\n\nDAVID MUIR: The question was about you as president, not about Former Speaker Pelosi. But I do want Vice President Harris to respond here.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: I was at the Capitol on January 6th. I was the Vice President-Elect. I was also an acting senator. I was there. And on that day, the president of the United States incited a violent mob to attack our nation's Capitol, to desecrate our nation's Capitol. On that day, 140 law enforcement officers were injured. And some died. And understand, the former president has been indicted and impeached for exactly that reason. But this is not an isolated situation. Let's remember Charlottesville, where there was a mob of people carrying tiki torches, spewing antisemitic hate, and what did the president then at the time say? There were fine people on each side. Let's remember that when it came to the Proud Boys, a militia, the president said, the former president said, \"Stand back and stand by.\" So for everyone watching who remembers what January 6th was, I say we don't have to go back. Let's not go back. We're not going back. It's time to turn the page. And if that was a bridge too far for you, well, there is a place in our campaign for you. To stand for country. To stand for our democracy. To stand for rule of law. And to end the chaos. And to end the approach that is about attacking the foundations of our democracy 'cause you don't like the outcome. And be clear on that point. Donald Trump the candidate has said in this election there will be a bloodbath, if this -- and the outcome of this election is not to his liking. Let's turn the page on this. Let's not go back. Let's chart a course for the future and not go backwards to the past.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Let me just follow up here--\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I have said blood bash, bath. It was a different term, and it was a term that related to energy, because they have destroyed our energy business. That was where bloodbath was. Also, on Charlottesville, that story has been as you would say, debunked. Laura Ingraham, Sean Hannity, Jesse -- all of these people, they covered it. If they go an extra sentence, they will see it was perfect. It was debunked in almost every newspaper. But they still bring it up just like they bring 2025 up. They bring all of this stuff up. I ask you this. You talk about the Capitol. Why are we allowing these millions of people to come through on the southern border? How come she's not doing -- and I'll tell you what I would do. And I would be very proud to do it. I would say we would both leave this debate right now, I'd like to see her go down to Washington, D.C. during this debate 'cause we're wasting a lot of time. Go down to -- because she's been so bad, it's so ridiculous. Go down to Washington, D.C. And let her sign a bill to close up the border. Because they have the right to do it. They don't need bills. They have the right to do it. The President of the United States, you'll get him out of bed. You'll wake him up at 4:00 in the afternoon, you'll say come on. Come on down to the office, let's sign a bill. If he ... if he signs a bill that the border is closed, all he has to do is say it to the border patrol, who are phenomenal. If they do that, the border is closed.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Mr. President --\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Those people are killing many people, unlike J-6.\n\nDAVID MUIR: We talked immigration here tonight. I do want to focus on this next issue to both of you. Because it really brings us, this into focus. Truth in these times that we're living in. Mr. President, for 3 and a half years after you lost the 2020 election you repeatedly falsely claimed that you won, many times saying you won in a landslide. In the past couple of weeks leading up to this debate, you have said, quote, you lost by a whisker, that you, quote, didn't quite make it, that you came up a little bit short.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I said that?\n\nDAVID MUIR: Are you now acknowledging that you lost in 2020?\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, I don't acknowledge that at all.\n\nDAVID MUIR: But you did say that.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I said that sarcastically. You know that. It was said, oh we lost by a whisker. That was said sarcastically. Look, there's so much proof. All you have to do is look at it. And they should have sent it back to the legislatures for approval. I got almost 75 million votes. The most votes any sitting president has ever gotten. I was told if I got 63, which was what I got in 2016, you can't be beaten. The election, people should never be thinking about an election as fraudulent. We need two things. We need walls. We need -- and we have to have it. We have to have borders. And we have to have good elections.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our elections are bad. And a lot of these illegal immigrants coming in, they're trying to get them to vote. They can't even speak English. They don't even know what country they're in practically. And these people are trying to get them to vote. And that's why they're allowing them to come into our country.\n\nDAVID MUIR: I did watch all of these pieces of video. I didn't detect the sarcasm, lost by a whisker, we didn't quite make it, and we should just point out as clarification, and you know this, you and your allies, 60 cases in front of many judges. Many of them --\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No judge looked at it.\n\nDAVID MUIR: And said there was no widespread fraud.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They said we didn't have standing. That's the other thing. They said we didn't have standing. A technicality. Can you imagine a system where a person in an election doesn't have standing, the President of the United States doesn't have standing? That's how we lost. If you look at the facts, and I'd love to have you -- you'll do a special on it. I'll show you Georgia and I'll show you Wisconsin and I'll show you Pennsylvania and I'll show you -- we have so many facts and statistics. But you know what? That doesn't matter. Because we have to solve the problem that we have right now. That's old news. And the problem that we have right now is we have a nation in decline and they have put it into decline. We have a nation that is dying, David.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Mr. President, thank you. Vice President Harris, you heard the president there tonight. He said he didn't say that he lost by a whisker. So he still believes he did not lose the election. That was won by President Biden and yourself. But I do want to ask you about something that's come up in the last couple of days. This was a post from President Trump about this upcoming election just weeks away. He said, \"When I win, those people who cheated,\" and then he lists donors, voters, election officials, he says \"Will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, which will include long-term prison sentences.\" One of your campaign's top lawyers responded saying, \"We won't let Donald Trump intimidate us. We won't let him suppress the vote.\" Is that what you believe he's trying to do here?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Donald Trump was fired by 81 million people. So, let's be clear about that. And clearly, he is having a very difficult time processing that. But we cannot afford to have a president of the United States who attempts as he did in the past to upend the will of the voters in a free and fair election. And I'm going to tell you that I have traveled the world as vice president of the United States. And world leaders are laughing at Donald Trump. I have talked with military leaders, some of whom worked with you. And they say you're a disgrace. And when you then talk in this way in a presidential debate and deny what over and over again are court cases you have lost, because you did in fact lose that election, it leads one to believe that perhaps we do not have in the candidate to my right the temperament or the ability to not be confused about fact. That's deeply troubling. And the American people deserve better.\n\nDAVID MUIR: I'll give you one minute to respond, Mr. President.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Let me just tell you about world leaders. Viktor Orban, one of the most respected men -- they call him a strong man. He's a tough person. Smart. Prime Minister of Hungary. They said why is the whole world blowing up? Three years ago it wasn't. Why is it blowing up? He said because you need Trump back as president. They were afraid of him. China was afraid. And I don't like to use the word afraid but I'm just quoting him. China was afraid of him. North Korea was afraid of him. Look at what's going on with North Korea, by the way. He said Russia was afraid of him. I ended the Nord Stream 2 pipeline and Biden put it back on day one but he ended the XL pipeline. The XL pipeline in our country. He ended that. But he let the Russians build a pipeline going all over Europe and heading into Germany. The biggest pipeline in the world. Look, Viktor Orban said it. He said the most respected, most feared person is Donald Trump. We had no problems when Trump was president. But when this weak pathetic man that you saw at a debate just a few months ago that if he weren't in that debate he'd be running instead of her, she got no votes, he got 14 million votes, what you did, you talk about a threat to democracy. He got 14 million votes and they threw him out of office. And you know what? I'll give you a little secret. He hates her. He can't stand her.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Mr. President --\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But he had 14 million votes. They threw them out. She got zero votes. And when she ran, she was the first one to leave because she failed. And now she's running. I don't understand it but I'm okay with it \u2013 because I think we're going to do pretty well.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Mr. President, your time is up. We've got a lot more to get to.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: Turning now to the Israel-Hamas war and the hostages who are still being held, Americans among them. Vice President Harris, in December you said, \"Israel has a right to defend itself\" but you added, \"It matters how.\" Saying international humanitarian law must be respected, Israel must do more to protect innocent civilians. You said that nine months ago. Now an estimated 40,000 Palestinians are dead. Nearly 100 hostages remain. Just last week Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said there's not a deal in the making. President Biden has not been able to break through the stalemate. How would you do it?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Well, let's understand how we got here. On Oct. 7, Hamas, a terrorist organization, slaughtered 1,200 Israelis. Many of them young people who were simply attending a concert. Women were horribly raped. And so absolutely, I said then, I say now, Israel has a right to defend itself. We would. And how it does so matters. Because it is also true far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed. Children, mothers. What we know is that this war must end. It must when, end immediately, and the way it will end is we need a cease-fire deal and we need the hostages out. And so we will continue to work around the clock on that. Work around the clock also understanding that we must chart a course for a two-state solution. And in that solution, there must be security for the Israeli people and Israel and in equal measure for the Palestinians. But the one thing I will assure you always, I will always give Israel the ability to defend itself, in particular as it relates to Iran and any threat that Iran and its proxies pose to Israel. But we must have a two-state solution where we can rebuild Gaza, where the Palestinians have security, self-determination and the dignity they so rightly deserve.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: President Trump, how would you negotiate with Netanyahu and also Hamas in order to get the hostages out and prevent the killing of more innocent civilians in Gaza?\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: If I were president it would have never started. If I were president Russia would have never, ever -- I know Putin very well. He would have never -- and there was no threat of it either, by the way, for four years. Have gone into Ukraine and killed millions of people when you add it up. Far worse than people understand what's going on over there. But when she mentions about Israel all of a sudden -- she hates Israel. She wouldn't even meet with Netanyahu when he went to Congress to make a very important speech. She refused to be there because she was at a sorority party of hers. She wanted to go to the sorority party. She hates Israel. If she's president, I believe that Israel will not exist within two years from now. And I've been pretty good at predictions. And I hope I'm wrong about that one. She hates Israel. At the same time in her own way she hates the Arab population because the whole place is going to get blown up, Arabs, Jewish people, Israel. Israel will be gone. It would have never happened. Iran was broke under Donald Trump. Now Iran has $300 billion because they took off all the sanctions that I had. Iran had no money for Hamas or Hezbollah or any of the 28 different spheres of terror. And they are spheres of terror. Horrible terror. They had no money. It was a big story, and you know it. You covered it. Very well, actually. They had no money for terror. They were broke. Now they're a rich nation. And now what they're doing is spreading that money around. Look at what's happening with the Houthis and Yemen. Look at what's going on in the Middle East. This would have never happened. I will get that settled and fast. And I'll get the war with Ukraine and Russia ended. If I'm President-Elect, I'll get it done before even becoming president.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: Vice President Harris, he says you hate Israel.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: That's absolutely not true. I have my entire career and life supported Israel and the Israeli people. He knows that. He's trying to again divide and distract from the reality, which is it is very well known that Donald Trump is weak and wrong on national security and foreign policy. It is well known that he admires dictators, wants to be a dictator on day one according to himself. It is well known that he said of Putin that he can do whatever the hell he wants and go into Ukraine. It is well known when that he said when Russia went into Ukraine it was brilliant. It is well known he exchanged love letters with Kim Jong un. And it is absolutely well known that these dictators and autocrats are rooting for you to be president again because they're so clear, they can manipulate you with flattery and favors. And that is why so many military leaders who you have worked with have told me you are a disgrace. That is why we understand that we have to have a president who is not consistently weak and wrong on national security including the importance of upholding and respecting in highest regard our military.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: Vice President Harris, thank you.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They're the ones -- and she's the one that caused it, that's weak on national security by allowing every nation last month for the year, 168 different countries sending people into our country. Their crime rates are way down. Putin endorsed her last week. Said I hope she wins. And I think he meant it. Because what he's gotten away with is absolutely incredible. It wouldn't have happened with me. The leaders of other countries think that they're weak and incompetent. And they are. They're grossly incompetent. And I just ask one question. Why does Biden go in and kill the Keystone pipeline and approve the single biggest deal that Russia's ever made, Nordstream 2, the biggest pipeline anywhere in the world going to Germany and all over Europe? Because they're weak and they're ineffective. And Biden, by the way --\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: President Trump...\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Gets paid a lot of money --\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: Thank you. We have a lot of issues to get to.\n\nDAVID MUIR: We'll be right back with much more of this historic ABC News presidential debate from the National Constitution Center right here in Philadelphia. Back in a moment.\n\nDAVID MUIR: And I want to turn to the war in Ukraine. We're now 2 1/2 years into this conflict. Mr. President, it has been the position of the Biden administration that we must defend Ukraine from Russia, from Vladimir Putin, to defend their sovereignty, their democracy, that it's in America's best interest to do so, arguing that if Putin wins he may be emboldened to move even further into other countries. You have said you would solve this war in 24 hours. You said so just before the break tonight. How exactly would you do that? And I want to ask you a very simple question tonight. Do you want Ukraine to win this war?\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I want the war to stop. I want to save lives that are being uselessly -- people being killed by the millions. It's the millions. It's so much worse than the numbers that you're getting, which are fake numbers. Look, we're in for 250 billion or more because they don't ask Europe, which is a much bigger beneficiary to getting this thing done than we are. They're in for $150 billion less because Biden and you don't have the courage to ask Europe like I did with NATO. They paid billions and billions, hundreds of billions of dollars when I said either you pay up or we're not going to protect you anymore. So that may be one of the reasons they don't like me as much as they like weak people. But you take a look at what's happening. We're in for 250 to 275 billion. They're into 100 to 150. They should be forced to equalize. With that being said, I want to get the war settled. I know Zelenskyy very well and I know Putin very well. I have a good relationship. And they respect your president. Okay? They respect me. They don't respect Biden. How would you respect him? Why? For what reason? He hasn't even made a phone call in two years to Putin. Hasn't spoken to anybody. They don't even try and get it. That is a war that's dying to be settled. I will get it settled before I even become president. If I win, when I'm President-Elect, and what I'll do is I'll speak to one, I'll speak to the other, I'll get them together. That war would have never happened. And in fact when I saw Putin after I left, unfortunately left because our country has gone to hell, but after I left when I saw him building up soldiers, he did it after I left, I said oh, he must be negotiating. It must be a good strong point of negotiation. Well, it wasn't because Biden had no idea how to talk to him. He had no idea how to stop it. And now you have millions of people dead and it's only getting worse and it could lead to World War 3. Don't kid yourself, David. We're playing with World War 3. And we have a president that we don't even know if he's -- where is our president? We don't even know if he's a president.\n\nDAVID MUIR: And just to clarify here.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They threw him out of a campaign like a dog. We don't even know, is he our president? But we have a president...\n\nDAVID MUIR: Mr. President,\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: ...that doesn't know he's alive.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Your time is up. Just to clarify the question, do you believe it's in the U.S. best interests for Ukraine to win this war? Yes or no?\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think it's in the U.S. best interest to get this war finished and just get it done. All right. Negotiate a deal. Because we have to stop all of these human lives from being destroyed.\n\nDAVID MUIR: I want to take this to Vice President Harris. I want to get your thoughts on support for Ukraine in this moment. But also as commander in chief if elected how would you deal with Vladimir Putin and would it be any different from what we're seeing from President Biden?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Well, first of all, it's important to remind the former president you're not running against Joe Biden, you're running against me. I believe the reason that Donald Trump says that this war would be over within 24 hours is because he would just give it up. And that's not who we are as Americans. Let's understand what happened here. I actually met with Zelenskyy a few days before Russia invaded, tried through force to change territorial boundaries to defy one of the most important international rules and norms, which is the importance of sovereignty and territorial integrity. And I met with President Zelenskyy. I shared with him American intelligence about how he could defend himself. Days later I went to NATO's eastern flank, to Poland and Romania. And through the work that I and others did we brought 50 countries together to support Ukraine in its righteous defense. And because of our support, because of the air defense, the ammunition, the artillery, the javelins, the Abrams tanks that we have provided, Ukraine stands as an independent and free country. If Donald Trump were president, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv right now. And understand what that would mean. Because Putin's agenda is not just about Ukraine. Understand why the European allies and our NATO allies are so thankful that you are no longer president and that we understand the importance of the greatest military alliance the world has ever known, which is NATO. And what we have done to preserve the ability of Zelenskyy and the Ukrainians to fight for their Independence. Otherwise, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv with his eyes on the rest of Europe. Starting with Poland. And why don't you tell the 800,000 Polish Americans right here in Pennsylvania how quickly you would give up for the sake of favor and what you think is a friendship with what is known to be a dictator who would eat you for lunch.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Vice President Harris Thank you. We heard from both of you on Ukraine tonight. Afghanistan came up in the last hour -- I wanted her to respond to something you said earlier.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I have to respond.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Please I'll give you a minute here.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Putin would be sitting in Moscow and he wouldn't have lost 300,000 men and women. But he would have been sitting in Moscow\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: (inaudible)\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Quiet, please. He would have been sitting in Moscow much happier than he is right now. But eventually, you know, he's got a thing that other people don't have. He's got nuclear weapons. They don't ever talk about that. He's got nuclear weapons. Nobody ever thinks about that. And eventually uh maybe he'll use them. Maybe he hasn't been that threatening. But he does have that. Something we don't even like to talk about. Nobody likes to talk about it. But just so you understand, they sent her to negotiate peace before this war started. Three days later he went in and he started the war because everything they said was weak and stupid. They said the wrong things. That war should have never started. She was the emissary. They sent her in to negotiate with Zelenskyy and Putin. And she did and the war started three days later.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Vice president...\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And that's the kind of talent we have with her. She's worse than Biden. In my opinion, I think he's the worst president in the history of our country. She goes down as the worst vice president in the history of our country. But let me tell you something. She is a horrible negotiator. They sent her in to negotiate. As soon as they left Putin did the invasion.\n\nDAVID MUIR: President Trump, thank you. You did bring up something, you said she went to negotiate with Vladimir Putin. Vice President Harris, have you ever met Vladimir Putin, can you clarify tonight?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Yet again, I said it at the beginning of this debate, you're going to hear a bunch of lies coming from this fella. And that is another one. When I went to meet with President Zelenskyy, I've now met with him over five times. The reality is, it has been about standing as America always should, as a leader upholding international rules and norms. As a leader who shows strength, understanding that the alliances we have around the world are dependent on our ability to look out for our friends and not favor our enemies because you adore strongmen instead of caring about democracy. And that is very much what is at stake here. The President of the United States is commander-in-chief. And the American people have a right to rely on a president who understands the significance of America's role and responsibility in terms of ensuring that there is stability and ensuring we stand up for our principles and not sell them for the benefit of personal flattery.\n\nDAVID MUIR: We've talked about Ukraine and Vladimir Putin. I do want to talk about Afghanistan. It came up in the first hour of this debate.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: David, one thing.\n\nDAVID MUIR: I want to move on to Afghanistan.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Secretary General Stoltenberg said Trump did the most amazing thing I've ever seen, he got these countries, the 28 countries at the time, to pay up. He said I've never seen -- he's the head of NATO. He said I've never seen -- for years we were paying almost all of NATO. We were being ripped off by European nations both on trade and on NATO. I got them to pay up by saying one of the statements you made before, if you don't pay we're not going to protect you.\n\nDAVID MUIR: President Trump--\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Otherwise we would've never gotten it. He said it was one of the most incredible jobs that he's ever seen done.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Thank you. I want to turn to Afghanistan. We witnessed a poignant moment today on Capitol Hill honoring the soldiers who died in the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan. I do want to ask the vice president, do you believe you bear any responsibility in the way that withdrawal played out?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Well, I will tell you, I agreed with President Biden's decision to pull out of Afghanistan. Four presidents said they would, and Joe Biden did. And as a result, America's taxpayers are not paying the $300 million a day we were paying for that endless war. And as of today, there is not one member of the United States military who is in active duty in a combat zone in any war zone around the world, the first time this century. But let's understand how we got to where we are. Donald Trump when he was president negotiated one of the weakest deals you can imagine. He calls himself a dealmaker. Even his national security adviser said it was a weak, terrible deal. And here's how it went down. He bypassed the Afghan government. He negotiated directly with a terrorist organization called the Taliban. The negotiation involved the Taliban getting 5,000 terrorists, Taliban terrorists released.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: And get this -- no, get this. And the president at the time invited the Taliban to Camp David. A place of storied significance for us as Americans, a place where we honor the importance of American diplomacy, where we invite and receive respected world leaders. And this former president as president invited them to Camp David because he does not again appreciate the role and responsibility of the President of the United States to be commander in chief with a level of respect. And this gets back to the point of how he has consistently disparaged and demeaned members of our military, fallen soldiers, and the work that we must do to uphold the strength and the respect of the United States of America around the world.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Vice President Harris, thank you. President Trump, your response to her saying that you began the negotiations with the Taliban.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah, thank you. So if you take a look at that period of time, the Taliban was killing our soldiers, a lot of them, with snipers. And I got involved with the Taliban because the Taliban was doing the killing. That's the fighting force within Afghanistan. They don't bother doing that because you know, they deal with the wrong people all the time. But I got involved. And Abdul is the head of the Taliban. He is still the head of the Taliban. And I told Abdul don't do it anymore, you do it anymore you're going to have problems. And he said why do you send me a picture of my house? I said you're going to have to figure that out, Abdul. And for 18 months we had nobody killed. We did have an agreement negotiated by Mike Pompeo. It was a very good agreement. The reason it was good, it was -- we were getting out. We would have been out faster than them, but we wouldn't have lost the soldiers. We wouldn't have left many Americans behind. And we wouldn't have left -- we wouldn't have left $85 billion worth of brand new beautiful military equipment behind. And just to finish, they blew it. The agreement said you have to do this, this, this, this, this, and they didn't do it. They didn't do it. The agreement was, was terminated by us because they didn't do what they were supposed to do.\n\nDAVID MUIR: I want to move on.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And these people did the worst withdrawal and in my opinion the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country. And by the way, that's why Russia attacked Ukraine. Because they saw how incompetent she and her boss are.\n\nDAVID MUIR: President Trump, thank you. I want to move on now to race and politics in this country. Mr. President, you recently said of Vice President Harris, \"I didn't know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black, and now she wants to be known as Black.\" I want to ask a bigger-picture question here tonight. Why do you believe it's appropriate to weigh in on the racial identity of your opponent?\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I don't. And I don't care. I don't care what she is. I don't care. You make a big deal out of something. I couldn't care less. Whatever she wants to be is okay with me.\n\nDAVID MUIR: But those were your words. So, I'm asking --\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I don't know. I don't know. All I can say is I read where she was not Black, that she put out. And, I'll say that. And then I read that she was black. And that's okay. Either one was okay with me. That's up to her. That's up to her.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Vice President Harris, your thoughts on this?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: I think it's \u2013 I mean honestly, I think it's a tragedy that we have someone who wants to be president who has consistently over the course of his career attempted to use race to divide the American people. You know, I do believe that the vast majority of us know that we have so much more in common than what separates us. And we don't want this kind of approach that is just constantly trying to divide us, and especially by race. And let's remember how Donald Trump started. He was a, a, a\u2014land, he owned land, he owned buildings, and he was investigated because he refused to rent property to Black families. Let's remember, this is the same individual who took out a full-page ad in The New York Times calling for the execution of five young Black and Latino boys who were innocent, the Central Park Five. Took out a full-page ad calling for their execution. This is the same individual who spread birther lies about the first Black President of the United States. And I think the American people want better than that. Want better than this. Want someone who understands as I do, I travel our country, we see in each other a friend. We see in each other a neighbor. We don't want a leader who is constantly trying to have Americans point their fingers at each other. I meet with people all the time who tell me \"Can we please just have discourse about how we're going to invest in the aspirations and the ambitions and the dreams of the American people?\" Knowing that regardless of people's color or the language their grandmother speaks we all have the same dreams and aspirations and want a president who invests in those, not in hate and division.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Vice President Harris thank you. Linsey?\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: President Trump, this is now your third time --\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: This is the most divisive presidency in the history of our country. There's never been anything like it. They're destroying our country. And they come up with things like what she just said going back many, many years when a lot of people including Mayor Bloomberg agreed with me on the Central Park Five. They admitted -- they said, they pled guilty. And I said, well, if they pled guilty they badly hurt a person, killed a person ultimately. And if they pled guilty -- then they pled we're not guilty. But this is a person that has to stretch back years, 40, 50 years ago because there's nothing now. I built one of the greatest economies in the history of the world and I'm going to build it again. It's going to be bigger, better and stronger. But they're destroying our economy. They have no idea what a good economy is. Their oil policies -- every single policy -- and remember this. She is Biden. She's trying to get away from Biden. I don't know the gentleman, she says. She is Biden. The worst inflation we've ever had. A horrible economy because inflation has made it so bad and she can't get away with that.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Mr. President, thank you, your time is up. Linsey --\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: I want to respond to that, though. I want to just respond briefly. Clearly, I am not Joe Biden, and I am certainly not Donald Trump. And what I do offer is a new generation of leadership for our country. One who believes in what is possible, one who brings a sense of optimism about what we can do instead of always disparaging the American people. I believe in what we can do to strengthen our small businesses, which is why I have a plan. Let's talk about our plans. And, and let's compare the plans. I have a plan to give startup businesses $50,000 tax deduction, to pursue their ambitions, their innovation, their ideas, their hard work. I have a plan. $6,000 for young families for the first year of your child's life. To help you in that most critical stage of your child's development. I have a plan that is about allowing people to be able to pursue what has been fleeting in terms of the American dream by offering help with down payment of $25,000, down payment assistance for first-time home buyers. That's the kind of conversation I believe, David, that people really want tonight as opposed to a conversation that is constantly about belittling and name-calling. Let's turn the page and move forward.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Vice President Harris, thank you.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: We have to move on. President trump --\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: She is destroying our country. She has a plan to defund the police. She has a plan to confiscate everybody's gun. She has a plan to not allow fracking in Pennsylvania or anywhere else. That's what her plan is until just recently.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: President Trump, President Trump.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: The former president has said something twice and I need to respond too. I just need to respond one time to what he has said multiple times.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: I'm sorry, we're going to move on, Vice President Harris. This is now your third time running for president. you have long vowed to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. You have failed to accomplish that. You now say you're going to keep Obamacare. Quote, unless we can do something much better. Last month you said, quote, we're working on it. So tonight, nine years after you first started running, do you have a plan and can you tell us what it is?\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Obamacare was lousy health care. Always was. It's not very good today. And what I said, that if we come up with something, we are working on things, we're going to do it and we're going to replace it. But remember this. I inherited Obamacare because Democrats wouldn't change it. They wouldn't vote for it. They were unanimous. They wouldn't vote to change it. If they would have done that, we would have had a much better plan than Obamacare. But the Democrats came up, they wouldn't vote for it. I had a choice to make when I was president, do I save it and make it as good as it can be? Never going to be great. Or do I let it rot? And I felt I had an obligation, even though politically it would have been good to just let it rot and let it go away. I decided -- and I told my people, the top people, and they're very good people -- I have a lot of good people in this -- that administration. We read about the bad ones. We had some real bad ones too. And so do they. They have really bad ones. The difference is they don't get rid of them. But let me just explain. I had a choice to make do I save it and make it as good as it can be or let it rot? And I saved it. I did the right thing. But it's still never going to be great. And it's too expensive for people. And what we will do is we're looking at different plans. If we can come up with a plan that's going to cost our people, our population less money and be better health care than Obamacare, then I would absolutely do it. But until then I'd run it as good as it can be run.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: So just a yes or no, you still do not have a plan?\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I have concepts of a plan. I'm not president right now. But if we come up with something I would only change it if we come up with something better and less expensive. And there are concepts and options we have to do that. And you'll be hearing about it in the not-too-distant future.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: Vice President Harris, in 2017 you supported Bernie Sanders' proposal to do away with private insurance and create a government-run health care system. Two years later you proposed a plan that included a private insurance option. What is your plan today?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Well, first of all, I absolutely support and over the last four years as vice president private health care options. But what we need to do is maintain and grow the Affordable Care Act. But I, I'll get to that, linsey. I just need to respond to a previous point that the former president has made. I've made very clear my position on fracking. And then this business about taking everyone's guns away. Tim Walz and I are both gun owners. We're not taking anybody's guns away. So stop with the continuous lying about this stuff. As it relates to the Affordable Care Act, understand, just look at the history to know where people stand. When Donald Trump was president, 60 times he tried to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. 60 times. I was a senator at the time. When, I will never forget the early morning hours when it was up for a vote in the United States Senate and the late great John McCain, who you have disparaged as being \u2013 uh, you don't like him, you said at the time because he got caught, he was an American hero. The late great John McCain, I will never forget that night. Walked onto the Senate floor and said no, you don't. No, you don't. No, you don't get rid of the Affordable Care Act. You have no plan. And what the Affordable Care Act has done is eliminate the ability of insurance companies to deny people with pre-existing conditions. I don't have to tell the people watching tonight, you remember what that was like? Remember when an insurance company could deny if a child had asthma, if someone was a breast cancer survivor, if a grandparent had diabetes? And thankfully, as I've been vice president and we over the last four years have strengthened the Affordable Care Act, we have allowed for the first time Medicare to negotiate drug prices on behalf of you the American people. Donald Trump said he was going to allow Medicare to negotiate dr, drug prices. He never did. We did. And now we have capped the cost of insulin at $35 a month. Since I've been vice president we have capped the cost of prescription medication for seniors at $2,000 a year. And when I am president we will do that for all people understanding that the value I bring to this is that access to health care should be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it. And the plan has to be to strengthen the Affordable Care Act, not get rid of it, (in audible) in terms of where Donald Trump stands on that.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: I want to move to an issue that's important --\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: She made a mistake. Number one, John McCain fought Obamacare for ten years. But it wasn't only him. It was, All of the Democrats that kept it going. And you know what? We could do much better than Obamacare. Much less money. But she won't improve private insurance for people. Private, medical insurance. That's another thing she doesn't want\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: President Trump.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: People are paying privately for insurance that have worked hard and made money and they want to have private. She wants everybody to be on government insurance where you wait six months for an operation that you need immediately.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: President Trump, thank you. We have another issue that we'd like to get to that's important for a number of Americans, in particular younger voters, and that's climate change. President Trump, with regard to the environment, you say that we have to have clean air and clean water. Vice President Harris, you call climate change an existential threat. The question to you both tonight is what would you do to fight climate change? And Vice President Harris, we'll start with you. One minute for you each.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Well, the former president had said that climate change is a hoax. And what we know is that it is very real. You ask anyone who lives in a state who has experienced these extreme weather occurrences who now is either being denied home insurance or is being jacked up. You ask anybody who has been the victim of what that means in terms of losing their home, having nowhere to go. We know that we can actually deal with this issue. The young people of America care deeply about this issue. And I am proud that as vice president over the last four years, we have invested a trillion dollars in a clean energy economy while we have also increased domestic gas production to historic levels. We have created over 800,000 new manufacturing jobs while I have been vice president. We have invested in clean energy to the point that we are opening up factories around the world. Donald Trump said he was going to create manufacturing jobs. He lost manufacturing jobs. And I'm also proud to have the endorsement of the United Auto Workers and Shawn Fain, who also know that part of building a clean energy economy includes investing in American-made products, American automobiles. It includes growing what we can do around American manufacturing and opening up auto plants, not closing them like what happened under Donald Trump.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: Vice President Harris, thank you.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: That didn't happen under Donald Trump. Let me just tell you, they lost 10,000 manufacturing jobs this last month. It's going -- they're all leaving. They're building big auto plants in Mexico. In many cases owned by China. They're building these massive plants, and they think they're going to sell their cars into the United States because of these people. What they have given to China is unbelievable. But we're not going to let that. We'll put tariffs on those cars so they can't come into our country. Because they will kill the United Auto Workers and any auto worker, whether it's in Detroit or South Carolina or any other place. What they've done to business and manufacturing in this country is horrible. We have nothing because they refuse -- you know, Biden doesn't go after people because supposedly China paid him millions of dollars. He's afraid to do it. Between him and his son. They get all this money from Ukraine. They get all this money from all of these different countries. And then you wonder why is he so loyal to this one, that one Ukraine, China? Why is he? Why did he get 3 1/2 million dollars from the mayor of Moscow's wife? Why did he get -- why did she pay him 3 1/2 million dollars? This is a crooked administration, and they're selling our country down the tubes.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: President Trump, thank you.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Thank you.\n\nDAVID MUIR: We'll be right back with closing statements from both of our candidates. A historic night, this ABC News Presidential Debate from Philadelphia. Back in a moment.\n\nDAVID MUIR: The time has come for closing statements. And Vice President Harris, we begin with you.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: So I think you've heard tonight two very different visions for our country. One that is focused on the future and the other that is focused on the past. And an attempt to take us backward. But we're not going back. And I do believe that the American people know we all have so much more in common than what separates us and we can chart a new way forward. And a vision of that includes having a plan, understanding the aspirations, the dreams, the hopes, the ambition of the American people, which is why I intend to create an opportunity economy, investing in small businesses, in new families, in what we can do around protecting seniors, what we can do that is about giving hard-working folks a break in bringing down the cost of living. I believe in what we can do together that is about sustaining America's standing in the world and ensuring we have the respect that we so rightly deserve including respecting our military and ensuring we have the most lethal fighting force in the world. I will be a president that will protect our fundamental rights and freedoms including the right of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. I'll tell you, I started my career as a prosecutor. I was a D.A. I was an attorney general. A United States senator. And now vice president. I've only had one client. The people. And I'll tell you, as a prosecutor I never asked a victim or a witness are you a Republican or a Democrat. The only thing I ever asked them, are you okay? And that's the kind of president we need right now. Someone who cares about you and is not putting themselves first. I intend to be a president for all Americans and focus on what we can do over the next 10 and 20 years to build back up our country by investing right now in you the American people.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: Vice President Harris, thank you. President Trump?\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: So, she just started by saying she's going to do this, she's going to do that, she's going to do all these wonderful things. Why hasn't she done it? She's been there for 3 1/2 years. They've had 3 1/2 years to fix the border. They've had 3 1/2 years to create jobs and all the things we talked about. Why hasn't she done it? She should leave right now, go down to that beautiful white house, go to the capitol, get everyone together and do the things you want to do. But you haven't done it. And you won't do it. Because you believe in things that the American people don't believe in. You believe in things like we're not going to frack. We're not going to take fossil fuel. We're not going to do, things that are going to make this country strong, whether you like it or not. Germany tried that and within one year they were back to building normal energy plants. We're not ready for it. We can't sacrifice our country for the sake of bad vision. But I just ask one simple question. Why didn't she do it? We're a failing nation. We're a nation that's in serious decline. We're being laughed at all over the world. All over the world, they laugh, I know the leaders very well. They're coming to see me. They call me. We're laughed at all over the world. They don't understand what happened to us as a nation. We're not a leader. We don't have any idea what's going on. We have wars going on in the Middle East. We have wars going on with Russia and Ukraine. We're going to end up in a third World War. And it will be a war like no other because of nuclear weapons, the power of weaponry. I rebuilt our entire military. She gave a lot of it away to the Taliban. She gave it to Afghanistan. What these people have done to our country, and maybe toughest of all is allowing millions of people to come into our country, many of them are criminals, and they're destroying our country. The worst president, the worst vice president in the history of our country.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: President Trump thank you. And that is our ABC News presidential debate from here in Philadelphia at the National Constitution Center. I'm Linsey Davis.\n\nDAVID MUIR: And I'm David Muir. Thank you for watching here in the U.S. And all over the world. And from all of us here at ABC News, good night.",

We look to the past and present for the first and second presidential debates before November 5 . The first debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris took place on September 10, 2016 .",
        "text": "The Trump-Harris debate: Do presidential debates change voter preferences?\nWhy do presidential debates matter? We look at history and data to find out.\n\nUnited States Vice President and Democratic Party nominee Kamala Harris faced off against former President and Republican candidate Donald Trump on September 10 in their first \u2013 and potentially only \u2013 presidential debate before November\u2019s election.\n\nHarris and Trump traded barbs on the stage in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania for 90 minutes, on everything from border controls and reproductive rights to the Taliban and bizarre, debunked claims about Haitian immigrants eating cats and dogs. This was the first time they had met.\n\nMany analysts and polls have since crowned Harris the \u201cwinner\u201d of the debate, which was held with a backdrop of polling that showed the two main candidates in a near dead heat both nationally and in a series of swing states expected to determine the outcome of the November 5 election.\n\nBut as election day fast approaches, a key question remains: do presidential debates really matter and do they shift voter perceptions of the two candidates?\n\nHere\u2019s what decades of debates, polling and research tell us:\n\nDo presidential debates change election results?\n\nOn the whole, research suggests the answer is mostly no.\n\nHarvard Business School Associate Professor Vincent Pons and Assistant Professor Caroline Le Pennec-Caldichoury of the University of California at Berkeley evaluated pre and post-election surveys in 10 countries, including the US, the United Kingdom, Germany and Canada, from 1952 \u2013 the year of the first televised presidential debate in the US \u2013 to 2017.\n\nThe results showed that televised debates did not significantly affect voter choice.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this perception that debates are this great democratic tool where voters can find out what candidates stand for and how good they really are,\u201d Pons was quoted in a 2019 article by the Harvard Business School as saying. \u201cBut we find that debates don\u2019t have any effect on any group of voters.\u201d\n\nAn analysis published in 2013 by University of Missouri communication Professors Mitchell McKinney and Benjamin Warner considered survey responses by undergraduate students from universities throughout the US from 2000 to 2012.\n\nThey too found that general election debates had very little effect on candidate preference with the candidate choice remaining unchanged for 86.3 percent of respondents before and after viewing the debate.\n\nWatching the debate helped 7 percent of respondents who had not decided who to vote for to make a decision. Only 3.5 percent of respondents switched from one candidate to another.\n\nBy the time the debates take place, most voters are already aligned with a party, Daron Shaw, professor at the government department at University of Texas in Austin, told Al Jazeera.\n\nOn the other hand, \u201cthose who are most likely to be affected \u2013 independents and undecided voters -are the least likely to watch the debates\u201d, Shaw, an expert on voting and participation, added.\n\nStill, there have been occasions when debates have boosted the chances of specific candidates. Ask Barack Obama.\n\nThe Obama boom\n\nIn the 2008 presidential race, Obama was able to achieve a significant lead days after the first debate, which took place on September 26, 2008.\n\nWhile Obama initially led in the polls, Republican competitor John McCain had caught up, and the two senators were neck and neck from September 9 to 14, according to the Pew Research Center. Obama was at 46 percent, compared with McCain\u2019s 44.\n\nFrom September 27 to 29, however, Obama surged to 49 percent, and McCain fell to 42 percent.\n\nBut what do more recent election cycles tell us about the impact of presidential debates on voter choices?\n\n2020 presidential debates: Almost no change\n\nTrump and Biden locked horns in two debates before the most recent presidential election, facing off on September 29 and October 22, 2020.\n\nA poll conducted by New Jersey-based Monmouth University before the first debate showed 87 percent of voters surveyed said the debate was not likely to impact their vote.\n\nThe Monmouth survey proved right. Voting analysis platform FiveThirtyEight\u2019s average of 2020 presidential election polls showed that on September 28, 2020, Biden was at 50.1 percent and Trump was at 43.2 percent. By September 30, Biden was at 50.5 and Trump was at 42.9.\n\nSimilarly, the polling numbers for the two candidates barely changed before and after the second debate.\n\nBiden won the 2020 election with 51.3 percent of the national popular vote and 306 Electoral College votes.\n\nWhat the 2016 presidential debates tell us\n\nDemocrat Hillary Rodham Clinton and Trump squared off in three heated debates eight years ago.\n\nSeptember 26, 2016, was the first debate. The two candidates sparred over everything from the racial divide in the US to Trump\u2019s disparaging comments about a beauty pageant winner. Clinton was on the offensive, Trump defensive.\n\nMost news reports the day after suggested that Clinton had dominated the debate. But according to FiveThirtyEight\u2019s poll average of 2016, that performance barely moved the needle. Clinton was at 42.4 percent while Trump was at 40.5 percent on September 25. By September 27, Clinton was at 42.5 compared with Trump\u2019s 41 percent.\n\nBy October 8, 2016, the gap between the two had grown: Clinton was at 44.8 percent and Trump was at 39.8. The second debate took place on October 9, but neither that debate nor the third one on October 19 changed polling numbers much.\n\nOn October 18, Clinton was at 45.5 percent and Trump was at 38.9 percent. By October 21, Clinton\u2019s numbers were unchanged while Trump was at 39.1 percent. Opinion polls showed the race tightening marginally in the final days of the election with Clinton still leading comfortably.\n\nOn election day \u2014 November 8 \u2014 Clinton secured 48 percent of the popular vote compared with Trump\u2019s 46 percent, but Trump won the decisive vote in the Electoral College under the indirect presidential election system in the US.\n\nWhat about the 2024 debates?\n\nHeading into the debate on June 27, Biden was trailing Trump by a small margin, according to polling averages compiled by FiveThirtyEight.\n\nHowever, Biden was widely criticised for his performance in the debate. He seemed lost, mumbled and was incoherent at times. From June 27 to July 9, Trump gained about 2 percentage points and was at 42.1 percent support, compared with Biden\u2019s 39.9 percent.\n\n\u201cThe first debate had spectacular effects, essentially providing the stimulus for knocking Biden out of the race. That was a seminal event, and highly unusual\u201d, Shaw said.\n\nSince Harris became the Democratic candidate, however, the race has changed dramatically.\n\nOn July 24, three days after Biden dropped out of the race, Harris was at 44.9 percent support while Trump was at 44. The gap has grown since then. As of September 9, Harris was at 47.2 percent, compared with Trump\u2019s 44.3 percent, according to the FiveThirtyEight average.\n\nOn September 11, Harris was at 47 percent, compared to Trump\u2019s 44.4 percent.\n\nDo presidential debates matter?\n\nA large body of research suggests that a key reason presidential debates usually don\u2019t influence voters too much is because most voters who tune in to these televised performances are already committed to a candidate.\n\nAccording to Shaw, debates matter because they show what issues candidates prioritise and hence \u201cthey provide cues by which voters construct preferences\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe week after the debate is often driven by reaction to issues and narratives from the debate\u201d, added Shaw.\n\n\u201cSo debates drive media coverage, which is critical, especially when the Harris-Trump contest is so attenuated\u201d.\n\nDebates can help undecided voters form a preference. And when a candidate is relatively unknown, as was the case with Obama in 2008 or Democrat John F Kennedy in 1960, presidential debates can influence how a candidate is perceived by voters.\n\nIn 1960, Kennedy and Republican Richard Nixon took part in four presidential debates. Nixon was the vice president under outgoing President Dwight Eisenhower. A widely held narrative that emerged from those debates suggests that the younger, more energetic Kennedy gained popularity over Nixon among those who watched the debates on television, even though Nixon fared better among voters who listened on the radio. An analysis by researchers at Purdue University in Indiana suggests that one reason for this was that Kennedy \u201cappeared better on television than Nixon\u201d.",

        "text": "As New Ballots Are Printed, Absentee Voting on Hold in North Carolina\nRaleigh, N.C.\n\nCounty boards of elections in North Carolina are now working to design and print new ballots for the 2024 general election without the We The People Party\u2019s presidential and vice presidential candidates on them, following a state court decision.\n\nThe N.C. Supreme Court, in a 4\u20133 ruling late Monday, required election officials to remove the We The People party line from the presidential contest on the ballot, including the party\u2019s presidential nominee, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and vice-presidential nominee, Nicole Shanahan.\n\nCounty boards of elections were prepared to send ballots to voters late last week, which is the state law deadline to begin absentee voting. With the court decision, revised ballots will now be printed and delivered to eligible voters who have requested an absentee ballot as soon as they are available, which is expected to occur in the next couple weeks.\n\nThe exact date when all 100 counties will have new ballots ready to send to absentee voters is uncertain. When that occurs, all counties will begin sending ballots on the same day. This is to ensure voters across the state have the same amount of time to cast their ballots.\n\nBecause of the order to reprint ballots, the State Board is preparing for the possibility that North Carolina cannot meet the 45-day deadline in federal law \u2014 Sept. 21 \u2014 for distributing military and overseas ballots to voters. The State Board has begun discussions with the U.S. Department of Defense to seek a potential waiver of that deadline, if ballots are not ready in all counties by that date.\n\nThere are 2,348 different ballot styles statewide for the 2024 general election. A ballot style is the ballot with a specific combination of contests that a voter is eligible to vote on, based on their residence. More than 2.9 million individual ballots had been printed before the court order.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to consult with counties and ballot vendors to determine the feasible start date for distributing absentee ballots statewide, mindful of the goal to meet the 45-day federal deadline,\u201d said Karen Brinson Bell, executive director of the State Board of Elections. \u201cThis decision imposes a tremendous hardship on our county boards, at an extremely busy time. But our election officials are professionals, and I have no doubt we will rise to the challenge.\u201d\n\nThe State Board has asked county boards to strictly separate and move to storage all ballots that had been printed with the We The People Party line on them. This is to avoid any possibility that the wrong ballots are sent to voters.\n\nThrough Monday, 146,603 voters, including more than 12,900 military and overseas voters, had requested ballots for the 2024 general election. See Absentee-By-Mail Request Stats: 2024 General Election.\n\n2024 General Election Dates and Deadlines\n\nHere are key dates and deadlines for the 2024 general election in North Carolina:\n\nOct. 11: Voter registration deadline (5 p.m.).*\n\nVoter registration deadline (5 p.m.).* Oct. 17: In-person early voting begins; same-day registration available.\n\nIn-person early voting begins; same-day registration available.

        "text": "Taylor Swift endorses Kamala Harris for president in post signed \u2018childless cat lady\u2019\nTaylor Swift has endorsed Kamala Harris for president, in a post on Instagram published minutes after the US presidential debate, saying the Democratic candidate would be the \u201cwarrior\u201d to fight for the rights and causes she believes in.\n\n\u201cAs a voter, I make sure to watch and read everything I can,\u201d Swift wrote on Instagram to her 283 million followers late on Tuesday, adding: \u201cI will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 presidential election\u201d.\n\n\u201cI think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos.\u201d\n\nIn her statement, Swift encouraged her fans to register to vote.\n\nSwift also addressed AI-generated images shared by Donald Trump in late August that falsely depicted Swift and her fans endorsing his campaign for president.\n\nShe said: \u201cIt really conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation. It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter.\u201d\n\nSwift said she had watched the US presidential debate between Harris and Trump, and urged her fans to do their research on \u201cthe stances these candidates take on the topics that matter to you the most\u201d.\n\nShe signed off \u201cChildless cat lady,\u201d a reference to comments made by Republican vice-presidential candidate JD Vance. The picture that appeared with the post was of Swift with her cat Benjamin Button, one of three she owns.\n\nAllow Instagram content? This article includes content provided by Instagram.

The Swifties for Kamala Coalition officially launched in late August, raising more than $138,000 for the Democratic candidate in a virtual rally featuring Carole King and the senators Elizabeth Warren and Kirsten Gillibrand.\n\nHarris\u2019 running mate, Tim Walz, said on MSNBC he was \u201cincredibly grateful\u201d to Swift. \u201cI say that also as a cat owner, a fellow cat owner,\u201d he said, adding that her endorsement took courage, \u201cand that\u2019s the kind of courage we need in America\u201d.\n\nIn 2012, researchers at Northwestern University and the University of Maryland tried to establish the correlation, if any, between celebrity endorsements and votes. They used Oprah Winfrey\u2019s endorsement of Barack Obama ahead of the 2008 Democrat primary to examine whether it had any effect on the polls.\n\nThe researchers concluded that Oprah Winfrey\u2019s endorsement was worth about a million votes for Obama, who beat his main primary challenger, Hillary Clinton, by about 270,000 votes in the states used in the sample.\n\n4:43 The second 2024 US presidential debate for Trump, the first for Harris \u2014 and factchecks - video\n\nSwift is a popular figure nationwide; especially among Democrats. An October 2023 Fox News poll found that 55% of voters overall, including 68% of Democrats, said they had a favourable view of Swift. Republicans were divided, with 43% having a favourable opinion and 45% an unfavourable one.\n\nCayce Myers, a professor of public relations at Virginia Tech, said Swift\u2019s endorsement may have an impact on the election because it may encourage younger Gen Z fans to vote.\n\nMyers added that while celebrity endorsements do not necessarily translate into meaningful turnout, Swift\u2019s endorsement was going out to a particularly large fanbase, and was focused on women\u2019s rights, an issue that favours Democrats.",

        "summary": " Social media is Gen Z\u2019s go-to source of political info for Gen Z . Social media will continue to play a more prominent role in the 2024 election . YouTube, X, and TikTok will be key platforms for political content from social media .",
        "text": "US Elections: Political Media Consumption Trends\nAmerican politics is a good lens for studying how communication changes. President Franklin D. Roosevelt spoke to the country directly in the 1930s on the radio, in a series dubbed \u201cfireside chats.\u201d In 1960, then-candidate John F. Kennedy made an impression on America during the first televised debate ever, with many believing this helped him eventually get elected.\n\nSocial media first played a role in 2008 during the first Obama campaign, when 3 million of his Facebook \u201cfriends\u201d catapulted him to victory, while Donald Trump\u2019s X account was a focal point of his rise in 2016 (and his defeat in 2020).\n\nSo, how will things look in 2024? Here are the 6 trends in political media & news consumption ahead of the US election that you need to know about:\n\nSocial media is Gen Z\u2019s go-to Political influencers are a force to be reckoned with YouTube, X, and TikTok are key platforms Americans are tired of attack ads \u2013 they want to know the basics Social media is fighting an uphill trust battle TV news is the winner \u2013 for now\n\nSocial media is Gen Z\u2019s go-to\n\nTV news is still the number one way to consume news overall in the US, and projected ad spend analysis reflects this, with linear TV set to take up around 70% of total ad spend.\n\nBut digital spend is projected to increase 156% from the last election in 2020, and for good reason \u2013 social media is the preferred source of political info for Gen Z.\n\nUS Gen Z are 58% more likely to consume political info on social media than they are on TV.\n\nBoth presidential candidates seem to have a social media strategy designed to appeal to Gen Z voters. VP Kamala Harris and her team have incorporated memes into their strategy, like \u201cbrat summer\u201d and \u201ccoconut tree,\u201d while former President Donald Trump recently completed a 2-hour interview on X with Elon Musk.\n\nThis is a long time coming. With many Gen Z having reached voting age, social media will continue to play a more prominent role in the 2024 election, and beyond.\n\nEven with social media primed to eventually be the go-to channel for news, there are still many knowledge gaps for candidates and parties when it comes to really understanding what voters want to see on social media, but we\u2019re here to shed some light.\n\nThe rise of political influencers\n\nInterestingly, official candidate and party accounts don\u2019t feature in the top 3 places US Gen Z have seen political content, despite their recent efforts. Verified news accounts (think legacy newspapers and TV networks, e.g. The New York Times and CNN) are #1 across all US generations. Even with low trust in social media content and platforms, the brand name and fact-verification processes of these accounts catapult them to the top.\n\nWhat comes after is more interesting. Unverified news accounts, often run by independent creators, are popular with Gen Z \u2013 ranking in the top four for other generations. However, these accounts do not undergo the fact-checking processes of verified sources and may introduce bias, potentially contributing to the echo chamber effect observed on social media.\n\nGen Z are also consuming political content from political influencers. These individuals have been recognized by both Republicans and Democrats, giving creators press credentials and spaces for interviews with big name officials.\n\nAt the same time, Gen Z also consume political content from influencers who don\u2019t focus on politics. Influencers are a crucial part of Gen Z\u2019s lives, and they count on them for more than just entertainment and product reviews. In fact, more Gen Z expect social media influencers to make public statements on social issues (34%) than they do news organizations (33%).\n\nOfficial candidate and party accounts are outside of Gen Z\u2019s top sources for political info on social media, despite recent efforts to get them on board. But getting their content on news accounts and with influencers (political or not) can get their party\u2019s message in front of a Gen Z audience. With Gen Z\u2019s expectation for social media influencers to speak up on social issues, brands who want to remain apolitical should tread carefully when it comes to influencer partnerships \u2013 or embrace this trend if they do want to take social stances.\n\nYouTube, X, and TikTok will be key platforms this election\n\nPolitical content from news accounts and influencers can be found on any social media platform, but users log onto each platform with different mindsets and expectations.\n\nBack in July 2024, YouTube came out on top as consumers\u2019 go-to platform for political content worldwide, and that\u2019s true in the US as well. But other platforms are increasingly being used as a news source since the last election.\n\nOf social media platforms, X (formerly Twitter) has the highest percentage of users logging on to keep up with the news, and that\u2019s remained stable since the last election.\n\nThe standout platform here is TikTok, with a 61% increase in Americans who go to the video app for news. Although the app has seen rapid growth in the last four years, TikTok far outpaces social media as a whole for being a news destination. Americans log onto the app expecting funny and creative content, but when it comes to political content, they prefer to see information like policy information and figures.\n\nSocial media managers for official candidate and party accounts have the tough job of making digestible content while highlighting some serious topics. But making a lasting impression on social media will be key to persuading voters during this election.\n\nAmericans strive for informative posts, not attacks\n\nAmerican politicians are notorious for airing attack ads on their opposition. An analysis of the ads aired during the 2016 US election found the majority of ads were negative (for both Democrats and Republicans), and further research shows that no one knows which ads are effective or not.\n\nOur Zeitgeist research shows only 24% of Americans 18+ like to see criticism of the opposition on social media ads. Instead, they\u2019re much more interested in seeing facts & figures (54%), policy details (52%), and different perspectives on issues (49%). In an election that\u2019s predicted to be very close, resonating with undecided voters is crucial, and they\u2019re telling us that they just want the facts.\n\nA majority of Americans say clear and concise info would make them engage with political content on social media more.\n\nThere are also generational differences for the type of content desired on social media. Gen Z are 49% more likely than the average American 18+ to want to see interactive elements like games and simulators, while millennials are keen to see celebrity endorsements, which the RNC and DNC was chock full of.\n\nSocial media is fighting an uphill trust battle\n\nWe highlighted the media\u2019s trust problem last year, and to this day, social media is the least trusted institution in the United States. Only 14% say they trust social media platforms a lot or completely, including only 18% of Gen Z \u2013 the generation most influenced by social media are still wary of what they\u2019re seeing.\n\nMisinformation is rampant on social media, especially in the age of AI and a lack of widespread fact verification. Even if social media platforms were to start implementing fact-checking verification, it might be met with some skepticism. Only 15% of Americans trust social media platforms themselves to provide accurate fact checks, perhaps a reason why verified news accounts that have their own fact-checking measures are the most consumed political accounts on social media.\n\nAmericans are 27% more likely than the average global consumer to trust independent fact-checking organizations to provide accurate fact-checks.\n\nAnother reason for low trust in social media is the fact nearly 80% of Americans think it contributes to social tension.\n\nWhile it\u2019s certainly an uphill battle for social media companies to earn trust back, the path forward is clear. Gen Z, the biggest users of social media, are 128% more likely than the average American to trust social media platforms to accurately fact-check their information. Americans also trust independent fact-checking organizations like Snopes, so a partnership with such an organization can help bring some trust back.\n\nTV is still on top\n\nEven with more efforts from social media companies to fact check posts, the clear winner in the trust wars is TV news. Americans 18+ are 141% more trusting of TV news to accurately provide fact-check info than social media, and is the most trusted source overall.\n\nAmericans\u2019 choice of TV news channels will heavily depend on their political leanings \u2013 Republicans will gravitate towards Fox News while Democrats will likely tune into MSNBC or CNN. But TV is the home for debates, election night coverage, and everything in between. Brands looking to stay more politically neutral might want to focus their ads on Freeform, TruTV, Animal Planet, and FX \u2013 TV channels that are enjoyed by Democrats and Republicans alike.\n\nOf course, Americans will likely be tuning into TV news while on another device; 58% of TV news watchers in the US browse social media when watching TV. During major political events, we\u2019ll surely see an uptick in discussion on X, views on YouTube, and scrolls on TikTok. TV news stations should lean into this with, on screen reminders for viewers to follow along on social media as they watch the news. It\u2019s likely social media will eventually become the go-to for news as Gen Z ages, but for now, TV will be the hub for politics in the United States.\n\nThe final comment: what you need to know\n\nWith Gen Z preferring social media news to TV news, and a triple-digit increase in digital ad spend this election cycle, it\u2019s safe to say that social media news needs to be taken seriously. There are many voters in the US that can be swayed for either party, and the right social media ad can do the trick.\n\nPlatforms like YouTube, X, and TikTok are primed for influence, but candidates should consider airing honest ads that lay out policy details alongside facts and figures, over ads that attack the opponent.\n\nTV news still reigns supreme, and even if social media does see an uptick on election night, scrollers will likely have the TV on at the same time. The media still has a trust problem, especially social media, but Americans seem to favor TV news for now.",

        "text": "Kamala Harris vs Donald Trump U.S. presidential debate: When and Where is the faceoff\nKamala Harris and Donald Trump will clash in their first and possibly last televised debate on Tuesday (September 10, 2024), in a potentially game-changing moment for the blockbuster 2024 U.S. presidential election.\n\nThe stakes could hardly be higher for the Democratic vice president and Republican former president as tens of millions of American voters tune in to see them finally face off.\n\nA single zinger or gaffe could tip the balance of one of the most dramatic White House races in U.S. political history, with the two rivals neck-and-neck in the polls with less than two months until election day.\n\nFor Vice President Harris, 59, it will be a critical chance to win over voters who still know little about her, as her honeymoon starts to fade after suddenly replacing President Joe Biden in July.\n\nMr. Trump, 78, will meanwhile try to box in Ms. Harris on issues like the economy and immigration, but may also unleash more of the racist and sexist insults that he\u2019s directed her way during the campaign.\n\nThe two candidates will also be meeting in person for the first time at the ABC News debate in Pennsylvania, adding to the potential for a bruising confrontation.\n\n\u201cThis debate may go down in the history books. Break out the popcorn,\u201d said Andrew Koneschusky, a former press secretary for U.S. Senate leader Chuck Schumer\n\nAlso read | Trump continues personal attacks against Harris, claims he\u2019s \u2018better looking\u2019 than her\n\n\u2018No floor\u2019\n\nMs. Harris, America\u2019s first female, Black and South Asian vice president, arrived in Philadelphia on the eve of the ABC News debate after five days holed up in a hotel doing intense practise sessions.\n\nOne of her aides even reportedly dressed up in a Trump-style boxy suit and long tie so she could get used to unloading her best lines on her opponent.\n\nTrump\u2019s team said he has taken a more relaxed approach ahead of his seventh presidential debate, choosing to arrive in Philadelphia just hours before and keeping his preparations limited.\n\nThe debate may lack the full-scale shouting matches of previous years, as the two candidates\u2019 microphones will be muted when they are not speaking, at the Trump team\u2019s request.\n\nBut it will still be a potential turning point - as well as a contrast in styles.\n\nIn one corner is a former prosecutor who has in the past delivered ice-cold put-downs to debate rivals including Biden himself and Trump\u2019s former vice president Mike Pence in the past.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no floor for him in terms of how low he will go,\u201d Harris said in a radio interview broadcast Monday. \u201cHe is probably going to speak a lot of untruths.\u201d\n\n\u2018Like a boxer\u2019\n\nIn the other corner is Donald Trump, the most brutal knife-fighter in U.S. politics, who has been convicted of falsifying business records to cover up a porn star scandal and is accused of trying to overturn the 2020 election.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t prepare for President Trump,\u201d his spokesman Jason Miller said. \u201cImagine like a boxer trying to prepare for Floyd Mayweather, or Muhammad Ali.\u201d\n\nMs. Harris in many ways has the most to prove at the debate.\n\nHer campaign suffered a setback at the weekend when a major New York Times/Siena poll showed Trump ahead by 48 to 47%, with the two candidates effectively tied in the half a dozen major battleground states.\n\nShe will be under pressure to spell out her so-far vague policy manifesto to voters, who according to the NYT poll said they need to know more about her.\n\nFormer reality TV star Trump is by far the more experienced presidential debater, with six under his belt, but swing voters may be put off if he insults the candidate aiming to become America\u2019s first woman president.\n\nTrump is still reveling in the fact that his last debate opponent, the 81-year-old Biden, performed so catastrophically that he was forced to withdraw from the race.",

Sign up for our daily newsletter to read future poll stories first, or donate today to support more projects like this.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris holds a three-point lead over former President Donald Trump, boosted by a wider advantage with women voters than he holds with men, according to a new 19th News/SurveyMonkey poll.\n\nAhead of their first and so far only scheduled presidential debate, the poll reveals that 44 percent of registered voters back Harris, the Democratic nominee, and 41 percent say they back Trump, the Republican. Meanwhile, 10 percent say they are undecided.\n\nHarris currently leads among women voters by 13 points (48 percent to 35 percent) and Trump leads men by eight points (47 percent to 39 percent). Nonbinary voters support Harris by a margin of 76 points (83 percent to 7 percent).\n\nHalf of voters approve of Harris, putting her net positive favorability rating within the poll\u2019s margin of error. Among women registered voters, she holds a 12-point net positive favorability rating; among men, she is 10 points underwater. Harris holds a 72-point net positive favorability rating among nonbinary voters.\n\nHarris has been a candidate since President Joe Biden dropped out on July 21, making hers the shortest general election campaign in modern history. With just eight weeks until Election Day, Harris and Trump are taking different approaches to make their case to voters. She has largely spurned major media interviews in favor of speeches and campaign events focused on rolling out specific policies. He has conducted more interviews and news conferences but maintained a comparatively lighter campaign schedule, relying on his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, for much of the retail politicking.\n\nThe poll also reveals that Democrats lead on the generic ballot for the U.S. House by three points, 42 to 39 percent, among registered voters. Women prefer the Democrat running for the House seat in their district by a 14-point margin, while the Republican contender has a seven-point edge with men. Nonbinary voters would vote for the Democrat by a margin of 72 points, 80 to 8 percent.\n\nSurveyMonkey conducted this poll online from August 26 through September 4 among a national sample of 20,762 adults, including 18,123 registered voters, with a modeled error estimate of plus or minus 1.0 percentage points.\n\nOne of the poll\u2019s key takeaways is that women favor Harris more than men across every racial and ethnic subgroup. If elected, Harris, who is Black and Indian American, would be the first woman president of the United States.\n\nTrump enjoys his highest support among White men, whom he leads by 14 points; White women back Harris by six points. Black women support Harris by a margin of 59 points, while Black men support her by 30 points.\n\nLatinx and Asian American-Pacific Islander (AAPI) voters make up sizable portions of the electorate in critical battleground states, including Arizona and Nevada. Harris leads among Latinas by a margin of 16 points, while Latinos back Trump by seven points. AAPI women support Harris by 11 points. Trump, for his part, leads AAPI men by just two points.\n\nWhen broken down by age, the poll shows that Harris holds higher support than Trump among older and younger voters. She is backed by 53 percent of those who are 65 and older; 39 percent of them support Trump. Trump has a narrow lead among 35- to 64-year-old voters, while Harris has an edge among voters 18 to 34.\n\nIndependent voters who don\u2019t lean toward either major political party are still largely up for grabs, the poll shows. Thirty-seven percent of them are undecided, 23 percent support Trump, 20 percent support Harris and 19 percent favor another candidate.\n\nNearly half of independent voters, or those who aren\u2019t registered to a political party, named inflation or the cost of living as their top voting issue.\n\nInflation is a leading concern going into the election, with 38 percent of all registered voters and 39 percent of women naming it the issue that matters most to them. After inflation, men were most likely to name immigration (12 percent) or jobs, unemployment and wages (10 percent) as their top issues. Women were more likely to name health care or abortion (11 percent each).\n\nWhile Harris hasn\u2019t explicitly centered the historic nature of her candidacy in her campaign, it still mobilizes her supporters \u2014 especially those represented in her Black and South Asian heritage. The poll reveals that enthusiasm to vote for her rose by five points among Black women and five points among AAPI women when they were asked how excited they were to vote for a candidate who could become the first woman president.\n\nOverall, Harris also holds a slight edge in voter enthusiasm over Trump \u2014 92 percent of Harris supporters say they are very or somewhat excited to vote for her, while 87 percent of Trump\u2019s supporters say the same.\n\nThe marriage gap has increasingly come to define American politics in the past several decades as married Americans have moved toward the Republican Party while voters who have never been married, especially women voters, have swerved left. Trump\u2019s running mate selection of Vance, who has repeatedly singled out women without children in his rhetoric, illuminates this growing divide.\n\nMarried men back Trump by 12 points, 51 percent to 39 percent, while men who have never been married back Harris by three points, 41 to 38 percent, the poll finds.\n\nMeanwhile, married women, who have leaned Republican in other data, narrowly back Harris, 46 to 41 percent. Women who have never been married support her by a much larger margin of 29 points, 52 to 23 percent.\n\nRepublicans, including Trump, have increasingly targeted LGBTQ+ people with legislation and incendiary rhetoric leading up to the 2024 election. Sixty-seven percent of LGBTQ+ voters support Harris.\n\nParents, as a group, support Trump over Harris by 13 points, 47 to 34 percent. Trump has a large advantage among fathers, who back him by 26 points, 55 to 29 percent, while the candidates are statistically tied among mothers. Parents of children under 2 supported Trump by the largest margin, 49 to 28 percent.\n\nBoth the Harris and Trump campaigns are centering family policy in their messaging, but coming at it from different approaches. Both have rolled out policies aimed at courting parents, including permanently expanding the child tax credit.\n\nWhen asked about the four candidates seeking the White House, 42 percent of poll respondents said Harris cares about the problems facing people like them and 40 percent said the same of Trump. The difference was larger between the Democratic vice presidential nominee and Vance: 35 percent of voters said Walz cared about their problems while 26 percent said so about Vance.\n\nTo check your voter registration status or to get more information about registering to vote, text 19thnews to 26797.",

        "text": "Erie\u2019s Crystal Ball: Will swing county pick presidential winner in 2024?\nImage\n\nWith the presidential election only 55 days away, many eyes are focused on Erie to see whether it once again picks the winner. In fact, on Tuesday night CNN broadcasts live from Mercyhurst University, where it has assembled a focus group that will watch the debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump together and then be interviewed by CNN anchor Phil Mattingly about their impressions.\n\nErie is often viewed as a bellwether in presidential elections due to its swing county status and historical voting patterns. In fact, Erie County has voted for the winner in the last four presidential elections:\n\n2008 Presidential Election: Erie County voted for Barack Obama, who won the presidency. 2012 Presidential Election: Erie County voted for Barack Obama, who won re-election. 2016 Presidential Election: Erie County voted for Donald Trump, who won the presidency. 2020 Presidential Election: Erie County voted for Joe Biden, who won the presidency.\n\nIn general, Erie County's voting pattern can be quite indicative of broader trends in Pennsylvania, which itself is a crucial swing state.\n\n\u201cPennsylvania has held 25 statewide elections for president, senator, governor, attorney general, treasurer, or auditor since 2008,\u201d said Mercyhurst University\u2019s Dr. Joe Morris, who is Erie\u2019s best-known political scientist and analyst. \u201cIn 23 of those 25 elections, Erie County voted for the winner. And voters there didn\u2019t simply support one side. They voted for 20 Democratic candidates and five Republican candidates, including Trump for president.\u201d\n\nFor more than a decade and in keeping with Erie\u2019s reputation as harbinger of election outcomes, journalists from near and far have sought out Morris. For the 2016 presidential election, in which Erie turned red for Trump, Morris fielded interview requests from as far away as Japan and the Netherlands.\n\nIn approaching the 2020 election, Morris was again called upon. One of the most memorable interviews came in 2019 when award-winning reporter Joie Chen traveled to Erie to interview Morris and other stakeholders for a segment on \u201cMatter of Fact with Soledad O\u2019Brien.\u201d\n\nAs for the 2024 election, he is equally busy here at home with interview requests from the local media, along with those from the Patriot News, USA Today, and Washington Examiner. He\u2019s also fielded his share of international media requests. In the past month, he\u2019s sat down at Mercyhurst with Rafael Balago, a reporter at Exame, Brazil\u2019s main business news outlet, and is scheduled for a Sept. 20 sit-down with C\u00e9dric Guigon, a journalist with RTS, the Swiss national public radio station. He also did a live five-minute interview with the BBC\u2019s Caitr\u00edona Perry from the Republican National Convention and another live interview with Perry from the Erie Bayfront.\n\n\u201cThere are few counties in the United States that tell us as much about the likely outcome of a presidential election as Erie County, Pennsylvania,\u201d Morris said. \u201cIf your eyes aren\u2019t on the northwestern corner of the commonwealth, they should be.\u201d\n\nPHOTO: CNN preps for live broadcast from Mercyhurst University.",

        "summary": " Polling expert Andy Crosby says both polls and polls can tell us valuable information about the election .

        "text": "Is there a silver bullet among presidential predictions?\nA polling surge following Kamala Harris's rise to the top of the Democratic ticket, and after the Democratic National Convention, has cooled, according to national presidential polls. Meanwhile, the \"13 Keys\" prognosticator has weighed in, predicting a Harris win. We asked UC Riverside polling and surveys expert Andy Crosby from the School of Public Policy what polls/predictions to believe \u2014 if any.\n\nQ: American University Professor Allan Lichtman is known for his accurate predictions of U.S. presidential elections, having predicted every winner since 1984. He has claimed that polls are just \"snapshots\" that the media/experts misinterpret, and that polls should not be given too much significance. Instead, he argues, his \"13 Keys to The White House\" formula factors what really matters. What are your thoughts on that?\n\nPolling expert Andy Crosby\n\nCrosby: Both Professor Lichtman's keys and polls can tell us valuable information about the election, and are two different methods of approaching the same problem. Professor Lichtman is correct that polls are indeed snapshots in time. To that end, polls become more accurate closer to elections because people do in fact change their minds for a variety of reasons (e.g., debate performances). It is worth noting that a number of Professor Lichtman's keys are also snapshots in time. For example, one of Lichtman's keys is the short-term economy during the campaign, which could of course change. Another of Professor Lichtman's keys is social unrest, which could of course occur at any time.\n\nProfessor Lichtman is also correct that polls can be misinterpreted (such as relying on national polls to predict the election outcome, as noted above). To that end, people who interpret polls should exercise caution. However, despite the challenges of polls, polls are still extremely valuable, and offer us information that is not available from Professor Lichtman's keys. For example, we use polls to predict primary elections, and Professor Lichtman's keys do not allow for this. Polls can also be conducted rapidly and can be tailored to deal with specific issues (such as public opinion on abortion). By contrast, some of the data used by Professor Lichtman are updated comparatively infrequently (such as economic data) and are more general. Again, in the end, both the keys and polls tell us valuable information, and there is room for both in political discourse.\n\nQ: We tend to look for a \u201cHoly Grail\u201d of prognostication where presidential elections are concerned. For some it\u2019s Lichtman\u2019s \u201c13 Keys.\u201d For others, it\u2019s Nate Silver (who is predicting a Trump win); on election day itself, many will be watching the New York Times needle. Is there a single poll/survey/prediction tool you\u2019ll be watching closely as Election Day draws close?\n\nCrosby: I will be watching the polls that are conducted closest to the election that use high-quality polling methods (including random sampling with transparent methodology), and I will be paying special attention to swing-state polls. Each poll represents a snapshot in time. Between the polls, events may happen (such as conventions and debate performances). We have already seen variations in polls over just the past few weeks, with the most recent New York Times/Siena College poll conducted Sept. 3-6 showing former President Trump slightly ahead once again (although within the poll's margin of error) after several polls previously showed Vice President Harris in the lead. As such, polls closer to the election are likely to be the most accurate.\n\nNate Silver's election forecast is also constructed based on polls, although it expands to include ratings of various pollsters (for example, the New York Times/Siena College is one of Silver's highest-rated pollsters with an A+ rating). Lichtman's keys also offer useful information, but I would caution that like polls, some of the keys may change between now and the election, and not all of the data used in the keys are updated as regularly as polls. With an election that has already been changing at a rapid pace (including replacing the Democratic candidate), timely data will be critical when it comes to accurately gauging the electorate.\n\nFinally, the New York Times Needle is quite different from polls, Silver's forecast, and Lichtman's keys: it predicts the election in real time on election night based on actual votes. Although certainly interesting to watch, it is not available until election night. Essentially, the Needle is an alternative to watching election returns roll in on television news programs with narration and analysis by your favorite broadcasters (think the late Tim Russert with \"Florida, Florida, Florida\" in 2000). I will certainly be watching election returns on the day of the election, but until then, I will be watching high-quality polls in swing states.",

        "text": "A Growing Share of Voters See the Election as a Referendum on Abortion Access; Vice President Harris Holds a Strong Advantage on the Issue\nMost voters (61%) now say that the outcome of this year\u2019s presidential election will have a major impact on access to abortion in this country \u2013 up 10 percentage points from March, a new KFF Health Tracking Poll finds.\n\nThe shift has occurred mainly among Democratic and independent voters over a period of time that saw Vice President Harris become the Democratic presidential nominee and make protecting abortion access a key component of her campaign.\n\nAbortion resonates most with Democratic women voters of reproductive age (under age 50). About one in five (21%) in this group name abortion as their top voting issue.\n\nDemocratic women voters of reproductive age overwhelmingly (90%) say the presidential election will have a major impact on abortion access \u2013 up 31 percentage points from six months ago. The vast majority (93%) of this group of voters say that abortion should be legal in all or most cases.\n\nAmong all voters, Vice President Harris holds a large advantage over former President Trump on who they trust to do a better job on the abortion issue (53% vs. 34%). That\u2019s a bigger lead on the issue than President Biden enjoyed earlier this year on a similar question before he dropped out of the race.\n\nVice President Harris also holds a narrower lead on trust to handle health care costs (48% vs. 39%). Independent voters give Harris an even bigger edge on health costs.\n\nMeanwhile, former President Trump holds a large trust advantage among all voters on two major non-health issues: the economy and inflation (52% vs. 37%) and immigration and border security (54% vs. 36%). Independents also give the edge to former President Trump on these issues.\n\nAmong Health Issues, Voters Are Most Eager to Hear the Candidates Address Costs\n\nAhead of tonight\u2019s presidential debate, voters identify costs as the health care issue that they most want former President Trump and Vice President Harris to talk about, likely reflecting broader concerns about the economy and inflation, which remains voters\u2019 top overall issue.\n\nAmong Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, nearly half (45%) say they most want former President Trump to talk about health costs, offering responses like prescription drug costs and insurance premiums. A similar share of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (42%) say they most want Vice President Harris to talk about health care costs.\n\nOther findings include:\n\nAmong all voters, six in ten (61%) say they would prefer a federal law restoring a national right to abortion similar to what existed under Roe v. Wade than leaving it up to the states to decide whether abortion is legal or not (39%). In the 10 states where voters could decide abortion ballot initiatives, voters prefer a federal law to leaving it up to the states by a similar margin (62% vs. 38%).\n\nAmong Democratic women voters under age 50, the vast majority (90%) say they favor a federal law restoring a nationwide right to abortion similar to what existed prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s 2022 decision overturning its Roe v. Wade precedent.\n\nWhen asked directly about these issues, voters say it is important for the presidential candidates to talk about abortion (84%), access to birth control (79%), and In vitro fertilization, or IVF, (57%) on the campaign trail. At least three-quarters of Democratic voters say it is important for the candidates to talk about each of these issues, as do most independent voters. Most Republican voters also say it is important for the candidates to discuss abortion and birth control access, but less than half say the same about IVF.\n\nDesigned and analyzed by public opinion researchers at KFF, the survey was conducted August 26-Sept. 4, 2024, online and by telephone among a nationally representative sample of 1,312 U.S. adults, including 1,084 registered voters, in English and in Spanish. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 4 percentage points for the full sample and among registered voters. For results based on other subgroups, the margin of sampling error may be higher.",

        "text": "Donald Trump has Survived the Legal Cases that Threatened His Campaign\nMedia Tip Sheets\n\nTo request an interview with Professor Germain, please contact Ellen James Mbuqe, executive director of media relations, at ejmbuqe@syr.edu.\n\nBy Gregory Germain, Professor of Law, Syracuse University College of Law.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s legal woes have been the center of international attention throughout this 2024 presidential election year. In less than two months before the Presidential election, here is a summary of where all those cases currently stand.\n\nThe E. Jean Carroll Defamation Case. Trump\u2019s year of litigation started in January with author E. Jean Carroll recovering an $83.3 million judgment for defamation against Trump for accusing Carroll of lying when she claimed publicly in 2019 that Trump had sexually assaulted her in a department store dressing room more than 20 years earlier, in 1995 or 1996. Trump posted a bond to obtain a stay while he appeals the judgment.\n\nThe NY Attorney General Financial Statement Fraud Case. In February, New York Attorney General Letitia James\u2019 civil fraud case against Trump for overstating the current market value of his properties in the personal financial statements he had submitted to lenders and insurance companies, came to trial without a jury before Judge Arthur Engeron. Normally, civil fraud requires a plaintiff to prove that a victim believed and relied on the truth of the statements, and suffered damages as a result. But the Attorney General successfully argued that a special anti-fraud statute, New York Executive Law \u00a7 63(12), allows her to recover disgorgement of benefits received without showing that anyone relied on or was harmed by the false statements. Judge Arthur Engeron entered a judgment against Trump in February for $354 million in disgorgement, plus interest, which would have required him to post a $464 million bond to obtain a stay pending appeal. The appellate division allowed Trump to post a reduced bond of $175 million to stay enforcement of the judgment pending appeal.\n\nThe Georgia Election Interference Case. On June 5, the Georgia Court of Appeals issued an order staying District Attorney Fani Willis\u2019s election interference case against Trump to consider Trump\u2019s motion to disqualify the District Attorney for having an undisclosed relationship with her special prosecutor, Nathan Wade. The trial judge, Scott McAffee, had previously allowed the case to continue if Nathan Wade resigned to prevent the appearance of impropriety. The defendants appealed McAffee\u2019s well reasoned order, and the case has been on hold by the appellate court since that time. Frankly, I thought McAffee\u2019s opinion was sound, and I never understood why Willis\u2019s relationship with Wade in any way harmed Trump or the other defendants.\n\nThe New York Falsified Business Records Case. Next came New York District Attorney Alvin Bragg\u2019s convoluted criminal case against Trump for falsifying his business records to hide a $175,000 hush money payment made to Stormy Daniels through Trump\u2019s then attorney Michael Cohen in the waning days of the 2016 election. I have written about the case previously. On May 30, 2024, the jury found Trump guilty under NYPL \u00a7 175.10 of falsifying business records to commit fraud and to conceal another crime, although the jury did not have to indicate who was defrauded or what other crime Trump was trying to conceal. Trump was supposed to be sentenced on September 18, but Judge Merchan granted Trump\u2019s request to postpone sentencing until after the election. Sentencing is currently scheduled for November 26.\n\nThe Federal Cases. The two federal court cases brought by Special Counsel Jack Smith are the most serious cases Trump faces, and both cases have been stuck in the mud for months.\n\nThe Federal Election Interference Case. The federal election interference case before District Judge Tanya Chutkan in Washington DC has been delayed by questions about presidential immunity, and now also by technical issues around special prosecutor Jack Smith appointment. These preliminary issues will need to be resolved before the case can proceed on the merits.\n\nOn July 1, 2024, the United States Supreme Court overturned Judge Chutkan\u2019s and the DC Circuit Court\u2019s rulings that Donald Trump, as a former president, had no immunity from prosecution.\n\nFrankly, I expected that the Supreme Court would reverse those decisions, and recognize that a president has immunity from criminal prosecution for \u201ccore\u201d presidential activities. In fact, at the hearing before the Supreme Court, both the government and Trump\u2019s lawyers agreed that an ex president is immune from prosecution for \u201cofficial\u201d presidential matters, and that there is no immunity for \u201cprivate\u201d matters. Trump\u2019s team even agreed that many matters alleged in Smith\u2019s complaint sounded like \u201cprivate\u201d not \u201cofficial\u201d matters. The disagreement was on how far \u201cofficial\u201d matters would go.\n\nI was fairly confident that the Supreme Court would draw the official /private distinction by focusing on the president\u2019s motives \u2013 was the president acting to further what he believed to be in the interests of the country, or did he have personal, corrupt, motives to benefit himself at the expense of the country?\n\nI was wrong. Chief Justice Roberts\u2019 majority opinion granted immunity far beyond what the Trump lawyers sought at the hearing. The Court held, first, that a president\u2019s motives are entirely irrelevant to whether his activities are \u201cofficial\u201d and subject to immunity, or \u201cprivate\u201d and not subject to immunity. Under the Court\u2019s ruling, a president has absolute immunity for anything plausibly connected to his presidential functions, including the most blatant kinds of corruption (such as selling presidential pardons to the highest bidder, or directing the military to assassinate a political rival). While it is difficult to imagine that the founders intended the Constitution to provide broad immunity from prosecution to a President Benedict Arnold, who sold out his country for personal gain, that was essentially the Court\u2019s holding.\n\nIn an attempt to redraw the official/private distinction, Prosecutor Jack Smith has filed a superseding indictment eliminating the allegations that Trump conspired with his governmental advisors, and has labeled his allegations that Trump conspired with non-governmental advisors to be \u201cprivate.\u201d But the labels do not matter. Under the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, Trump is immune from activities that fall within a very broad sphere of presidential activity, even if he had false, improper and corrupt motives for his actions. Given the extremely broad way that the Supreme Court defined \u201cofficial\u201d activities and rejected motive, it is difficult to see how any of Trump\u2019s attempts to overturn the election would qualify as purely \u201cprivate\u201d activities.\n\nNevertheless, Judge Chutkan and the DC Circuit will likely try to read the immunity ruling more narrowly than the Supreme Court wrote it, and allow the case to proceed. And if the case does proceed, and Jack Smith is able to prove his allegations that Trump knew he lost the election, knew that his election interference claims were false, and nevertheless sought corrupt motives to overturn the election, then surely a jury would convict him. But would the case survive another visit to the Supreme Court? Judge Chutkan set a briefing schedule for the parties to argue the immunity question, with Trump\u2019s reply brief due on October 29. Since the case cannot move forward before the court rules on the immunity question, the only thing that could happen before the election is the filing by Jack Smith of evidence that support his arguments that Trump\u2019s activities were \u201cprivate\u201d and not immune.\n\nThe second preliminary issue is whether Jack Smith\u2019s appointment as special prosecutor was constitutional, and if not whether the case should be dismissed. As discussed below, Judge Eileen Cannon dismissed the classified documents case against Trump on the grounds that Smith\u2019s appointment was unconstitutional. That decision is currently on appeal, and Chutkan stated on the record that she did not find Judge Cannon\u2019s ruling to be \u201cvery persuasive.\u201d Judge Chutkan will likely decide that special prosecutor Jack Smith can proceed with the prosecution, but the process may be delayed further for briefing on that issue, and the ultimate ruling on Judge Cannon\u2019s dismissal could derail the election interference case.\n\nThe Classified Documents Case.\n\nIn my view, the strongest case against Donald Trump is the classified documents case, which has been stymied at every turn by Judge Eileen Cannon. Cannon, a Trump appointee, was previously and harshly reversed by the Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, in an unusual unanimous per curium opinion, for improperly exercising equitable jurisdiction over the government\u2019s investigation into the classified documents taken by Trump while leaving office.\n\nAfter months of slow walking the case, on July 15, 2024, Judge Cannon dismissed the government\u2019s indictment, determining that the Justice Department regulation under which Special Prosecutor Jack Smith was appointed was unconstitutional under the appointments clause of the Constitution.\n\nThe Constitution\u2019s appointments clause requires the President to appoint, and the Senate to confirm, all \u201cOfficers of the United States,\u201d except for \u201cinferior Officers\u201d who can be appointed by Officers without Senate approval if the Officers are authorized by law to make the appointment.

The courts have recognized that mere \u201cofficials\u201d and \u201cemployees\u201d can be hired without authorizing legislation, presidential appointment, Senate approval, or direct appointment by authorized Officers. The distinctions between \u201cOfficers,\u201d \u201cInferior Officers,\u201d \u201cOfficials\u201d and \u201cEmployees\u201d is not defined in the Constitution, and depends on factors like power, authority, control, and permanency. By tradition, cabinet officers and the heads of agencies are Senate-approved \u201cOfficers,\u201d including the Attorney General and all 93 US Attorneys running the district offices of the Justice Department. The thousands of assistant US Attorneys and all of their staff are inferior officers, officials or employees, and are not appointed by the President or confirmed by the Senate.\n\nThe technical issue is whether Special Counsel Jack Smith, appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland under the Department of Justice\u2019s special counsel regulation, is an \u201cOfficer\u201d who must be appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, an inferior officer who was appointed by an authorized Officer, or an official or employee who could be hired without Senate approval or congressional authorization.\n\nThe legal firepower behind Judge Canon\u2019s decision comes from a law review article by Professors Steven G. Calabresi and Gary Lawson, Why Robert Mueller\u2019s Appointment As Special Counsel Was Unlawful, 95 Notre Dame L. Rev. 87,115\u201316 (2019). Calabresi and Lawson also filed amicus briefs with the Supreme Court in the Trump immunity case, and before Judge Cannon. Even though it was not an issue the Supreme Court agreed to hear, Justice Thomas wrote a concurring opinion in the election interference case throwing his support behind questioning Jack Smith\u2019s appointment.\n\nWhile Calabresi and Lawson\u2019s technical legal arguments, and Judge Cannon\u2019s adoption of those arguments, are plausible, they fly in the face of 50 years of practice, including the Supreme Court\u2019s famous Watergate tapes decision in US v. Nixon, 418 US 683 (1974), brought by special counsel Leon Jaworski, who was appointed under a similar justice department regulation, and whose appointment was not questioned by the Supreme Court.\n\nThere are legitimate criticisms of the Special Counsel Regulations. If the Justice Department has a conflict of interest, should they be the ones to select the special counsel? In 1978, after Watergate, Congress created a Special Prosecutor Act, later called the Independent Counsel Act, which allowed majorities of either party within the House or Senate Judiciary Committee to request that the Attorney General appoint a special prosecutor. If the Attorney General made the appointment, a three judge panel of appellate judges, rather than the conflicted Attorney General, would select the special prosecutor. This process provided some assurance that the special prosecutor would be independent from the conflicted justice department. The Supreme Court upheld the Act in Morrison v. Olson, but the Clinton administration did not seek its renewal, preferring instead to control the process through agency regulation, which has created the issue.\n\nThere is really no way to know if the current Special Counsel Regulations are constitutional until the Supreme Court rules on them. But even if they are not constitutional, there is no reason for dismissing the indictment against Trump. Instead, the courts should allow the government to fix the problem by appointing a senate-approved \u201cOfficer,\u201d such as the Attorney General or another United States Attorney to supervise the prosecution. Professors Calabresi and Lawson have recognized that this is a technical constitutional issue that can be cured by appointing an approved \u201cOfficer\u201d to supervise the case. The technical defect in Smith\u2019s appointment, which is easily curable, did not prejudice the defendants. There is no reason that a United States Attorney appointed to supervise the case now could not ratify Smith\u2019s past work, and allow Smith to proceed with the prosecution under supervision. A case prosecuted by Jack Smith under the supervision of the United States Attorney would be like the thousands of cases brought by Assistant United States Attorneys every day in every jurisdiction.\n\nWhat Happens Next?\n\nThe presidential election will take place on November 5, 2024.\n\nIf Trump wins the election, there is little doubt that he will cause the federal election interference and classified documents cases to be dismissed, either by appointing loyalists to take over the prosecution in the Justice Department, or by issuing himself a presidential pardon. The Supreme Court has signaled in its immunity decision that a self-pardon is within the President\u2019s absolute authority.\n\nHowever, a presidential pardon only applies to federal crimes, so it would not prevent any of the state prosecutions or cases from continuing. It is not clear whether a state prison sentence could be implemented against a sitting president, or how it could be implemented, or whether some sort of federal supremacy would prevent the states from interfering with the activities of an elected president. Another constitutional crisis is likely if either of the state criminal cases results in a prison sentence.\n\nIf Trump loses the election, he will likely face years of trials and appeals before the legal issues will be finally determined.",

In the debate, each candidate was given two minutes to respond to questions with their opponent's microphone muted. The debate covered immigration, economic policy, abortion and foreign policy, among other topics.\n\n\n\nDiscussion:\n\n\n\nWarm up questions:\n\nWho are the two candidates and what are their political backgrounds?\n\nare the two candidates and what are their political backgrounds? What topics did the debate planners try to cover?\n\ntopics did the debate planners try to cover? Where did the debate take place?\n\ndid the debate take place? How did the candidates attempt to connect with their supporters, independents and potential new voters?\n\ndid the candidates attempt to connect with their supporters, independents and potential new voters? What seemed to be the strategies of the candidates according to the commentators?\n\nImmigration\n\n\n\nHarris said that she prosecuted transnational gangs and criminals who were in the country. She blamed Trump for killing a bipartisan immigration bill. Trump spent much of the debate tying Harris to a dramatic rise in migrants in the U.S., which he blamed for increases in crime and threats to the economy.\n\nHarris blames Trump for killing a bipartisan border deal:\n\nTrump calls Biden/Harris border policy \"one of the greatest mistakes in history\":\n\nFocus question: How important do you think immigration policy is to the outcome of this election?\n\n\n\nTaxes and the economy\n\n\n\nHarris addressed her message on the economy to the middle class and suggested a policy focused on child tax credits, small business credits and housing. She criticized Donald Trump for focusing on tax breaks for the wealthiest and suggested his policy on tariffs that could raise costs. Donald Trump blamed Harris and President Joe Biden for dramatic inflation and suggested that immigration policies by the Biden administration would threaten the jobs of U.S. citizens.\n\nTrump on tariffs:\n\nHarris on the effects of Trump's plan:\n\n\n\nFocus question: What strategies did each candidate use in framing the debate around the economy?\n\n\n\nAbortion\n\n\n\nTrump accused Harris and her running mate Tim Walz of supporting abortion even after the birth of children (this claim was challenged by the debate moderators and is not true). He also said that his appointment of Supreme Court justices has led to abortion laws being decided at the state level. Harris claimed Trump would sign a national law outlawing abortion and spoke out against women suffering medical emergencies because doctors were afraid to provide medical care that might be considered an abortion under some state laws.\n\nHarris on Trump insulting the public with misinformation about abortion:\n\nTrump on supporting IVF and accuses Harris of supporting late-term abortions:\n\n\n\nFocus question: Do you think abortion legislation should be left to the states, or should there be one national policy?\n\n\n\nEnvironment\n\n\n\nHarris accused Trump of claiming that climate change is a hoax. She also touted investment in a clean energy economy while boosting gas and oil production. Trump focused on trade deals and accused Harris and Biden of allowing China and other countries to gain an edge in manufacturing and energy and largely avoided the topic of the environment.\n\nTrump and Harris debated climate and economic investment:\n\n\n\nFocus question: Why do you think environment and climate change wasn't addressed early or as often as topics like the economy and immigration?\n\nForeign policy\n\nTrump accused Harris and the Biden administration of being weak on the international stage and touted his support from Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n. Harris also accused Trump of being weak and easily manipulated by dictators and strongmen. Harris pointed to her work strengthening alliances such as NATO while Trump claimed conflicts such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7 wouldn't have happened under his administration.\n\nTrump touts his support from leaders such as Viktor Orb\u00e1n:\n\nHarris claims Trump is easily manipulated by flattery and favors:\n\n\n\nFocus question: What significant differences did you hear between foreign policy approaches between the two candidates?\n\n\n\nDig deeper: To help contextualize this debate in the history of presidential debates, you can choose clips from this NewsHour archive of past presidential debates, or use this lesson to explore presidential debate strategy and history.

The Republican presidential candidate has yet to decide a settled line of attack against the vice-president . The event will take place under the same rules that governed the Trump-Biden debate .",
        "text": "Harris and Trump make final preparations for crucial debate\nIt was the debate that was never meant to happen.\n\nDonald Trump will take the stage in Philadelphia on Tuesday night to face, not the familiar foe he expected when he agreed to the encounter in May, but an opponent he has never met and has struggled to define; Kamala Harris, the US vice-president, whose emergence as the Democratic nominee has changed the direction, and very nature, of the presidential election.\n\nThe Republican nominee anticipated that he would be keeping a date in the City of Brotherly Love for a second engagement with Joe Biden, the US president with whom he had an acrimonious debating history from the 2020 election.\n\nInstead the unprecedented impact of June\u2019s debate in Atlanta between the pair \u2013 in which Biden\u2019s halting and incoherent performance led to him withdrawing his candidacy after mounting pressure from his own Democratic party \u2013 has left Trump confronting an opponent against whom he has still to decide a settled line of attack.\n\nHarris, for her part, goes into the event having been prepared by aides who have aped Trump\u2019s often vicious and insulting debating technique \u2013 especially towards women \u2013 and bolstered by her experience from a previous career as a courtroom prosecutor. She is also buoyed by being up against an adversary who was recently convicted of 34 felony charges.\n\nThe pair face off in the midst of a race that multiple polls show is neck-and-neck \u2013 both nationally and in key swing states \u2013 none more than in Pennsylvania, the site of Tuesday\u2019s debate, with more electoral votes up for grabs than any other battleground state.\n\nTuesday\u2019s event, hosted by ABC, will take place under the same rules that governed the Trump-Biden debate, with candidates\u2019 microphones being muted when it is their opponent\u2019s turn to speak. Harris\u2019s campaign argued for mics to be kept live throughout \u2013 hoping to goad the former president into the undisciplined and unsavoury interruptions that have marred his previous performances.\n\nView image in fullscreen A billboard advertising the upcoming presidential debate between former Trump and Harris. Photograph: Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA\n\nWhile Trump was ready to agree, his entourage \u2013 determined to keep him focused and on-message \u2013 insisted on keeping the original rules.\n\nBut it is Trump\u2019s difficulty in coming to terms with Biden\u2019s departure from the race that could decide the contours of the debate, according to Steven Fein, a specialist in presidential debates and professor of psychology at Williams College in Massachusetts.\n\n\u201cI think, maybe the most interesting and potentially explosive element of it is the fact that he clearly was very upset that Biden dropped out and has been replaced by Harris,\u201d said Fein, who suggested the debate had greater potential for mind games and psychological drama than any he had previously studied.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a mighty task for him to control his tendencies. Whenever he\u2019s baited \u2026 by a woman, he\u2019s usually been very nasty. And a woman of colour is just like the nightmare scenario.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to have to be some give and take in a way that there didn\u2019t have to be in the first debate, when he didn\u2019t have to say much but just let Biden flail. So the potential for all kinds of drama is great.\u201d\n\nThe former president has been preparing for the debate with, among others, Tulsi Gabbard, a former Democratic member of Congress-turned Trump supporter who ran for the party\u2019s presidential nomination in 2020 and memorably tangled with Harris in a primary debate.\n\nIn an eve-of-debate call with journalists on Monday, Jason Miller, a Trump adviser, said that it would be Harris who would have difficulty preparing for Trump.\n\n\u201cThe fact that Trump is out there every day doing unscripted questions [means] you can\u2019t prepare for him,\u201d he said, comparing it with training to prepare to fight Muhammad Ali. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what his style is going to be. He has an amazing mix of humour and charm, as well as hard-hitting facts.\u201d\n\nWith Hugo Lowell",

Various reports including from the House Select January 6 Committee and the Government Accountability Office also called for the DHS Secretary to consider a National Special Security Event designation for future Certification of Electoral Votes.\n\n\u201cNational Special Security Events are events of the highest national significance,\u201d said Eric Ranaghan, the Special Agent in Charge of the U.S. Secret Service\u2019s Dignitary Protective Division. \u201cThe U.S. Secret Service, in collaboration with our federal, state, and local partners are committed to developing and implementing a comprehensive and integrated security plan to ensure the safety and security of this event and its participants.\u201d\n\nThe formal planning process is underway with the formation of an Executive Steering Committee. The Executive Steering Committee is made up of senior representatives from federal, state and local law enforcement and public safety partners and will begin convening in the coming weeks.\n\nIn addition to the 2025 Counting and Certification of Electoral Votes on Jan. 6, the 2025 Presidential Inauguration on Jan. 20 was previously designated a National Special Security Event and planning has been ongoing for several months.\n\nThis designation allows for significant resources from the federal government, as well as from state and local partners, to be utilized in a comprehensive security plan. When an event is designated a National Special Security Event, the U.S. Secret Service assumes its mandated role as the lead agency for the design and implementation of the operational security plan.",

She called Harris a \"steady-handed, gifted leader\" and a champion of \"LGBTQ+ rights, IVF and a woman's right to own her body\" Swift's endorsement had been widely anticipated .",
        "text": "Taylor Swift endorses Kamala Harris after presidential debate\nPop superstar Taylor Swift endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris' presidential candidacy on Tuesday night after the high-stakes debate with former President Donald Trump, calling the Democratic nominee a \"steady-handed, gifted leader.\"\n\n\"I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election,\" Swift said in a post on Instagram to her more than 283 million followers. \"I\u2019m voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them. I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos.\"\n\nSwift went on to say that she was \"heartened and impressed\" by Harris' selection of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, praising him as a champion of \"LGBTQ+ rights, IVF and a woman's right to own her body for decades.\"\n\n\"I\u2019ve done my research, and I\u2019ve made my choice,\" the Grammy-winning artist added. \"Your research is all yours to do, and the choice is yours to make. I also want to say, especially to first time voters: Remember that in order to vote, you have to be registered! I also find it\u2019s much easier to vote early. I\u2019ll link where to register and find early voting dates and info in my story.\"\n\nSwift, 34, signed her post \"Childless Cat Lady\" \u2014 a reference to language used by Trump's running mate, Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, to describe women who do not have kids. Swift included a photo of herself holding her cat, Benjamin Button, who has graced the cover of Time magazine with the singer.\n\nSwift's endorsement came as a surprise to the Harris campaign, two campaign officials told NBC News. The campaign views the singer's backing as part of a \"decisive victory\" for the vice president on the debate stage and speaks to her ability to attract support, one of the officials said.\n\nWalz appeared to learn about the endorsement during a live post-debate interview with MSNBC's Rachel Maddow. Walz patted his chest and smiled as Maddow read Swift's endorsement message.\n\n\"That was eloquent and it was clear,\" Walz said, \"and that's the kind of courage we need in America to stand up.\"\n\nThe endorsement had been widely anticipated. Swift, who has an enormous worldwide fan base, threw her support behind President Joe Biden and Harris during the 2020 presidential election. Swift allowed the Biden-Harris campaign to use her song \u201cOnly the Young\u201d in an advertisement during the 2020 cycle.\n\nSwift once shied away from weighing in on American politics. But with the release of her documentary \"Miss Americana\" in 2020, she became more vocal. The movie chronicled her behind-the-scenes fight to publicly denounce Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., then a member of the House. She endorsed Blackburn's Senate opponent, Phil Bredesen.\n\nBlackburn ultimately won the race, but Swift's post on Instagram encouraging her followers to register to vote activated waves of young people, Vote.org said at the time.\n\nIn November, a national NBC News poll found 40% of registered voters had positive views of Swift, while 16% had negative views. A majority of Democrats (53%) viewed her positively, while 28% of Republicans said the same.\n\nIn the Instagram post, Swift also criticized social media users who have circulated images generated by artificial intelligence falsely stating that she had endorsed the Trump-Vance ticket. Trump shared a series of those images on his Truth Social platform.\n\n\"Recently I was made aware that AI of \u2018me\u2019 falsely endorsing Donald Trump\u2019s presidential run was posted to his site. It really conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation,\" she said. \"It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter. The simplest way to combat misinformation is with the truth.\"\n\nSwifties for Kamala, a group of fans who have no official affiliation with either woman, said they were \"thrilled.\"\n\n\"We\u2019ve had no doubt that Taylor would endorse at the right time and are excited about the momentum she will bring to this campaign,\" Irene Kim, the group's co-founder, said in a statement.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News on Wednesday morning, Trump said he was not a fan of Swift. \"She seems to always endorse a Democrat, and she\u2019ll probably pay a price for it in the marketplace,\" he said.",

Harris claimed that world leaders were laughing at Trump, while Trump alleged that President Joe Biden \"hated\" her.\n\nThis debate marked the first in-person encounter between Trump and Harris, held on September 10 (US time) on ABC News.\n\nPreviously, on June 27, Trump debated Joe Biden, in which Biden's performance was widely seen as poor. The poor show sparked worry within the Democratic Party over whether the incumbent was fit enough to run a presidential campaign.\n\nOn July 21, Biden gave in to pressure from within his party and withdrew from the race, endorsing his running mate and current US Vice-President Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee.\n\nNow, with Harris and Trump having met for their debate, the stage is set for November 5, when American voters will decide who will succeed Joe Biden as the next President of the United States.\n\nHowever, before that there are several key days that will shape the 2024 US election. Here's a look.\n\nSeptember 18 \u2013 Special election in New Jersey\u2019s 10th District\n\nA special election will be held in New Jersey\u2019s 10th congressional district after the passing of Democratic Representative Donald Payne Jr Newark City Council President LaMonica McIver is the Democratic candidate, while small business owner Carmen Bucco is running for the Republicans.\n\nSeptember 20 \u2013 Early voting starts in Virginia\n\nVirginia will be the first state to open early voting, allowing residents to cast their ballots ahead of the general election.\n\nOctober 1 \u2013 First vice presidential debate\n\nKamala Harris\u2019s running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, will face off against Donald Trump\u2019s vice-presidential pick, Ohio Senator JD Vance, in a debate on CBS News.\n\nThe debate will be moderated by Norah O'Donnell, anchor of CBS Evening News, and Margaret Brennan, moderator of Face the Nation and CBS News\u2019 chief foreign affairs correspondent.\n\nNovember 5 \u2013 Election Day\n\nOn Election Day, voters will not only choose the next president but also determine the makeup of Congress and state governments. 34 Senate seats, all 435 House seats, and 12 governorships are up for election.\n\nDecember 17 \u2013 Electors cast votes\n\nElectors in each state will meet to cast their official votes for President and Vice President, in accordance with state laws.

It moved the needle\n\ntoggle caption Matthew Pearson/WABE\n\nDUNWOODY, Ga. \u2014 A small, but potentially crucial slice of voters remain undecided about the presidential election this fall, including in tossup Georgia. Just outside Atlanta, Cameron Lewellen, a father of three little kids, is one of them.\n\nIn 2020, Lewellen voted for Joe Biden. But four years prior, he cast his ballot for Donald Trump. And in the last election, he split his ticket between the Republican candidate for governor and the Democrat running for U.S. Senate. With early voting in 2024 a few weeks away, Lewellen has felt stuck.\n\n\u201cThis is tough,\u201d he says.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nSuburban voters like Lewellen have helped shape recent elections in this closely divided state, as some independents and disaffected Republicans drifted from their party in the Trump era. Metro Atlanta\u2019s suburbs are also growing and becoming more diverse.\n\nAfter Biden notched a win by just under 12,000 votes in Georgia, voters in 2022 sent Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock back to Washington and reelected Republican Gov. Brian Kemp.\n\ntoggle caption Sam Gringlas/WABE\n\nOn Tuesday night, Lewellen tuned into the debate in an effort to help crystallize his choice this fall. Lewellen settled into a plush, cream couch across from a big screen TV and a spread of pizzas. On a scratch piece of paper, he wrote in permanent marker the names of the two candidates and drew a line down the middle for his notes.\n\nLewellen says he soured on Trump as his presidency grew so chaotic, he began to fear for the stability of government, especially after the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. At this point, Lewellen says he knows who Trump is, but sees Kamala Harris as more of a question mark. He has some serious reservations.\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t earn my vote,\u201d Lewellen says. \u201cShe just was basically anointed because she was the vice president, second in charge.\u201d\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAnd while Lewellen felt Harris got off to a slow start in the debate, declining to directly answer a question on whether Americans were better off financially four years ago, he says he came away encouraged by her proposals to speed the construction of new homes and offer tax incentives for starting a small business. He also says he felt turned off when Trump did not offer any regrets about his conduct on Jan. 6.\n\n\u201cAs I think about it, it makes me angry because I think that\u2019s crap,\u201d Lewellen says. \u201cTake responsibility.\u201d\n\nAnd when Trump doubled down on his remarks about Harris\u2019 race and identity, Lewellen says it stung.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s offensive to a lot of us,\u201d Lewellen says. \u201cBecause you don\u2019t wake up deciding to be Black. I\u2019m an African American and I\u2019ve had people in the past, for me speaking the King\u2019s English, ask, \u2018Why are you talking white?\u2019 or whatever.\u201d\n\ntoggle caption Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\n\nHis vote is coming into sharper focus\n\nLewellen says while he went into the debate leaning toward Trump, now he says he is more likely to vote for Harris. But he worries about the markets and interest rates and has been searching for a job for the last several months. He notes that the pace of hiring has slowed . Finding something that fits his experience in health care and technology has been slow-going.\n\nHe says if the economy takes a turn for the worse this fall, he will reevaluate his vote again.\n\n\u201cI want a president that\u2019s going to be really favorable to small business because that\u2019s how I could ultimately leave a legacy for my family. But if you\u2019re telling me we\u2019re going to wake up sometime in October and have a 10% slide on the market, I don\u2019t think Harris can run from that.\u201d\n\nLewellen says it is frustrating when people press why he has not made up his mind yet. He says he has always valued carefully studying the issues and learning about a candidate\u2019s policies. He thinks both candidates have upsides and drawbacks.\n\nAt first thought, Lewellen says the choice has not been gnawing at him. \u201cYou know, day to day, I think about my kids and what we\u2019re going to eat and soccer games and baseball.\u201d But reflecting on the debate and the many topics he is thinking about, like conflicts abroad, abortion, affordability and democracy, he reconsidered.\n\n\u201cI guess it does weigh on me,\u201d he says.",

        "text": "Taylor Swift supports Kamala Harris for 2024 US Presidential election\n'Embarrassing, Absurd!': NFL & Travis Kelce Fans Blast Singer Taylor Swift's Latest Promo Video\n\nPop icon Taylor Swift has made headlines once again, this time for endorsing Kamala Harris in the upcoming 2024 U.S. presidential election. Following a tense debate between Harris and Donald Trump , Swift took to Instagram to share her support for the Democratic candidate, emphasizing Harris' leadership and commitment to the causes she holds dear.In her post, Swift stated, \"I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election.I\u2019m voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them.\" She continued by praising Harris for her calm and steady leadership, contrasting it with the chaos that Swift feels has permeated recent political discourse. For the globally influential artist, Harris represents a beacon of stability, one she believes is essential for America's progress.Swift's endorsement comes at a critical time in the election cycle, as tensions run high between the two candidates. The endorsement from a figure with Swift's cultural clout is expected to sway a significant number of voters, particularly among her younger fanbase, many of whom may have just reached voting age.In addition to her endorsement of Harris, Swift addressed a separate issue that has gained traction online\u2014AI-generated images and misinformation. The singer revealed that an AI-generated image falsely showing her endorsing Donald Trump had surfaced online, adding to the growing concern over the misuse of AI in politics. Swift expressed her alarm over the spread of such misinformation, stating, \"It really conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation.\" She emphasized the importance of transparency in combating falsehoods, reaffirming her real stance in support of Harris.The debate between Harris and Trump, which lasted 90 minutes, covered various hot-button issues such as economic policy, the Israel-Hamas war, abortion rights, and immigration. The showdown left voters with much to consider as they look ahead to the 2024 election, a contest in which celebrity endorsements like Swift\u2019s may prove influential in shaping the outcome.",

        "text": "Six Human Rights Takeaways from the US Presidential Debate\nClick to expand Image US presidential candidates, former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, at the presidential debate in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, September 10, 2024. \u00a9 2024 Brian Snyder/Reuters\n\nHuman rights in the United States and abroad were central to the issues raised throughout the presidential debate last night between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump:\n\n1. Neither candidate centered human rights in their comments on border and immigration policy. Harris said she had supported a border bill that would have \u201cput 1,500 more border agents on the border to help those folks who are working there right now over time trying to do their job [and] put more resources to allow us to prosecute transnational criminal organizations for trafficking in guns, drugs and human beings.\u201d Trump said multiple times, \u201cwe [are] allowing these millions of people to come through on the southern border,\u201d and also said, \u201cI'll tell you what I would do ... Go down to Washington, D.C. And ... sign a bill to close up the border.\u201d In response to a question about his proposal for the largest domestic deportation operation in the history of the country using the National Guard, Trump said he would also use \u201clocal police.\u201d\n\nNeither candidate acknowledged the US\u2019 legal obligation not to return refugees to harm. Neither called for fair, orderly, and humane procedures for immigrants and asylum seekers nor acknowledged the country\u2019s obligations to respect rights to family unity and due process.\n\n2. The debate over access to abortion has changed since the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, rolling back the constitutional protection for this essential healthcare right and handing power to individual states. Trump said, \u201cEach individual state is voting [on abortion]. It's the vote of the people. Now it's not tied up in the federal government.\u201d When moderators asked if he would veto a national abortion ban, he did not specifically answer. Harris said, \u201cI pledge to you when Congress passes a bill to put back in place the protections of Roe v. Wade as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law.\u201d\n\nCandidates should publicly support efforts to protect the rights of approximately 22 million women and girls of reproductive age, as well as other people who can become pregnant, who now live in US states where abortion access is heavily restricted or totally inaccessible. States and the federal government need to provide access to safe and legal abortion and end criminalization efforts as part of their human rights responsibilities.\n\n3. On the issue of phasing out fossil fuels, Harris said, \u201cI will not ban fracking,\u201d and Trump said, \u201cI got the oil business going like nobody has done before.\u201d\n\nA human rights centered approach to this issue would require the US to end all forms of support for new oil, gas, and coal development to rapidly reduce emissions in line with its obligations and limit the human rights impacts of climate change. Policies on fossil fuels should center the health and rights of frontline communities, where people of color are disproportionately exposed to pollution.\n\n4. Harris said it was time to \u201cstand for our democracy\u201d and Trump said that \u201cthey\u2019re [the Democratic party] the threat to democracy.\u201d The former president mentioned he was endorsed by the Hungarian prime minister, noting that Viktor Orba\u0301n said \u201cthe most respected, most feared person is Donald Trump. We had no problems when Trump was president.\u201d Human Rights Watch has reported that Orban has crippled the rule of law and democratic institutions in Hungary, attacked LGBT and minority communities, and made it mandatory for women seeking abortions to listen to a fetal heartbeat.\n\nA human rights approach to democracy and voting rights in the US requires following the ten principles on elections and human rights noted by Human Rights Watch and the enactment of legislation like the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. This legislation would ensure people do not face discrimination and restrictive barriers as they try to vote.\n\n5. On housing, Harris said, \u201cWe know that we have a shortage of homes and housing, and the cost of housing is too expensive for far too many people.\u201d She also said that \"access to affordable health care should be a right.\" Trump did not address housing specifically. On health care Trump said, \u201cIf we can come up with a plan that's going to cost our people, our population less money and be better health care than Obamacare [the Affordable Care Act], then I would absolutely do it.\u201d\n\nThe rights-based solution to these issues is more affordable and accessible housing for all and moving towards a healthcare system that is universally accessible and affordable for all, regardless of people\u2019s ability to pay. These policies would ensure everyone can equally enjoy their rights to health care and education.\n\n6. On Gaza, Harris said \u201cIsrael has a right to defend itself \u2026 and how it does so matters. Because it is also true far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed.\u201d Trump said, \u201cIf I were president it would have never started.\u201d\n\nCandidates should commit to upholding international law and US law in relation to the ongoing war. The federal Foreign Assistance Act prohibits security assistance to any government that restricts the delivery of US humanitarian aid. The better-known Leahy laws prohibit weapons from going to military units that have committed gross violations of human rights.\n\nNeither candidate centered key rights issues in their discussion of foreign policy challenges, such as the wars in Ukraine and Sudan and widespread violence and food insecurity in Haiti.\n\nFor more about the rights at stake in November, read our Human Rights Guide to the 2024 US Election.",

        "text": "Election officials warn that widespread problems with the US mail system could disrupt voting\nTOPEKA, Kan. (AP) \u2014 State and local election officials from across the country on Wednesday warned that problems with the nation\u2019s mail delivery system threaten to disenfranchise voters in the upcoming presidential election, telling the head of the U.S. Postal Service that it hasn\u2019t fixed persistent deficiencies.\n\nIn an alarming letter, the officials said that over the past year, including the just-concluded primary season, mailed ballots that were postmarked on time were received by local election offices days after the deadline to be counted. They also noted that properly addressed election mail was being returned to them as undeliverable, a problem that could automatically send voters to inactive status through no fault of their own, potentially creating chaos when those voters show up to cast a ballot.\n\nThe officials also said that repeated outreach to the Postal Service to resolve the issues had failed and that the widespread nature of the problems made it clear these were \u201cnot one-off mistakes or a problem with specific facilities. Instead, it demonstrates a pervasive lack of understanding and enforcement of USPS policies among its employees.\u201d\n\nThe letter to U.S. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy came from two groups that represent top election administrators in all 50 states. They told DeJoy, \u201cWe have not seen improvement or concerted efforts to remediate our concerns.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe implore you to take immediate and tangible corrective action to address the ongoing performance issues with USPS election mail service,\u201d they added. \u201cFailure to do so will risk limiting voter participation and trust in the election process.\u201d\n\nWhat to know about Trump\u2019s second term:\n\nStaffing the administration: Here are the people Trump has picked recess appointments Follow all of our coverage as Donald Trump assembles his second administration.\n\nThe Postal Service on Wednesday reiterated DeJoy\u2019s assurances that it\u2019s well positioned to swiftly deliver election mail despite being in the midst of a network modernization that has caused some delivery hiccups. Mail is currently being delivered in 2.7 days on average, officials said, but the Postal Service is still urging voters not to procrastinate.\n\n\u201cWe are ready to deliver. We were successful in 2020 delivering a historic volume of mail in ballots; also in 2022 and will do so again in November 2024,\u201d Adrienne Marshall, director of Election Mail and Government Services, said in a statement.\n\nThe two groups, the National Association of Secretaries of State and the National Association of State Election Directors, said local election officials \u201cin nearly every state\u201d are receiving timely postmarked ballots after Election Day and outside the three to five business days USPS claims as the standard for first-class mail.\n\nThe letter comes less than two weeks after DeJoy said in an interview that the Postal Service was ready to handle a flood of mail ballots expected as part of this November\u2019s presidential election and as former President Donald Trump continues to sow doubts about U.S. elections by falsely claiming he won in 2020.\n\nThat year, amid the global pandemic, election officials reported sending just over 69 million ballots in the mail, a substantial increase from four years earlier.\n\nWhile it\u2019s likely that number will be smaller now, many voters have embraced mail voting and come to rely on it. And both Democrats and Republicans have launched efforts to push supporters to vote early, either in person or by mail to \u201cbank\u201d their votes before Election Day on Nov. 5.\n\nThe letter went out on the day the first mailed ballots of this year\u2019s general election were being sent, to absentee voters in Alabama.\n\nPostal Service officials told reporters last month that almost 98% of ballots were returned to election officials within three days in 2020, and in 2022, the figure was nearly 99%. DeJoy said he would like to inch closer to 100% this election cycle and that the Postal Service is better positioned to handle ballots than four years ago.\n\nBut officials in rural states have been critical of the Postal Service for years as it has consolidated mail-processing centers to cut its costs and financial losses.\n\nIn addition to being signed by the current and incoming presidents for both groups of election officials, the leaders of groups that represent local election officials in 25 states were listed.\n\nThe election officials warned that any election mail returned to an election office as undeliverable could trigger a process outlined in federal law for maintaining accurate lists of registered voters. That means a voter could be moved to \u201cinactive\u201d status and be required to take additional action to verify their address to participate in the election, the officials said in the letter.\n\nKansas Secretary of State Scott Schwab, the recent past president of the National Association of Secretaries of State, sent his own letter in recent days to DeJoy. He said nearly 1,000 ballots from his state\u2019s Aug. 6 primary election couldn\u2019t be counted because they arrived too late or without postmarks \u2014 and more continue to come in.\n\n\u201cThe Pony Express is more efficient at this point,\u201d Schwab posted on the social media platform X in late August.\n\nSchwab and other Kansas election officials also have said some ballots arrive on time but without postmarks, which keeps them from being counted under Kansas law. What\u2019s more, Schwab told DeJoy, local postal clerks have told election officials that they can\u2019t add postmarks later even if it\u2019s clear that the Postal Service handled the ballot ahead of the mail-in deadline.\n\nKansas will count ballots postmarked on or before Election Day if they arrive within three days. The Republican-controlled Legislature created that grace period in 2017 over concerns that mail delivery had slowed after the Postal Service shut down seven mail-processing centers in the state. That left much of the state\u2019s mail handled through larger centers in Denver, Amarillo, Texas, and Kansas City, Missouri.\n\nSchwab has promoted the use of local ballot drop boxes for voting in advance, breaking with other Republicans who have suggested without evidence that they can be sources of fraud. Schwab has long said the boxes are more secure than the U.S. mail.\n\n\u201cKeep your ballot out of the hands of the federal government!\u201d he advised voters in a post on X after the August primary.\n\nIn their letter Wednesday, election officials said colleagues across the U.S. have reported that Postal Service staff, from managers to mail carriers, are uninformed about the service\u2019s policies for handling election-related mail, give them inconsistent guidance and misdeliver ballots.\n\n\u201cThere is no amount of proactive communication election officials can do to account for USPS\u2019s inability to meet their own service delivery timelines,\u201d the officials wrote. \u201cState and local election officials need a committed partner in USPS.\u201d\n\n____ Cassidy reported from Detroit.",

        "text": "How the Harris-Trump US presidential debate influenced Internet traffic\n9 min read\n\nMuch has changed in the 2024 United States presidential election since the June 27 debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden, then the presumptive nominees for the November election. Now, over two months later, on September 10, the debate was between Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, and Donald Trump, the Republican nominee. In this post, we will explore the event's impact on Internet traffic in specific states where there was a bigger impact than during the Biden-Trump debate, as well as examine cyberattacks, email phishing trends, and general DNS data on candidates, news, and election-related activity.\n\nWe\u2019ve been tracking the 2024 elections globally through our blog and election report on Cloudflare Radar , covering some of the more than 60 national elections this year. Regarding the US elections, we have previously reported on trends surrounding the first Biden vs. Trump debate , the attempted assassination of Trump, the Republican National Convention , and the Democratic National Convention .\n\nTypically, we have observed that election days don\u2019t come with significant changes to Internet traffic, and the same is true for debates. Yet, debates can also draw attention that impacts traffic, especially when there is heightened anticipation. The 2024 debates were not only aired on broadcast and cable television, but also streamed on platforms like YouTube, increasing their reach and impact.\n\nKey takeaways:\n\nThe September 10 Harris-Trump debate caused bigger drops in Internet traffic in the US than the Biden-Trump debate on June 27.\n\nThere was also a noticeable increase in DNS traffic to both Kamala Harris-related and Donald Trump-related domains, with Trump-related DNS traffic peaking around the start of the debate and Harris-related DNS traffic peaking after the debate ended, around the time Taylor Swift announced she was endorsing Harris.\n\nWe also observed increases in DNS traffic to US news media outlets and election-related domains right after the debate ended.\n\nDonald Trump remains the candidate with the most mentions in email subjects and the highest percentages of emails classified as spam (26.7%) and malicious (2.4%). Since mid-August, there has been a slight increase in the percentage of spam and malicious emails mentioning Kamala Harris.\n\nTraffic drop in the US\n\nDuring the September 10, 2024, debate between Harris and Trump, hosted by ABC News at 21:00 EST (01:00 UTC) in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Cloudflare noted a trend similar to the Biden-Trump debate, with a clear drop in nationwide Internet requests, falling as much as 9% below the same time a week prior at 21:15 EST (01:15 UTC). At the end of the debate, around 22:45 EST (02:45 UTC), the drop was less evident, at just 2%. Traffic increased slightly just after the debate.\n\nNote: there were two four-minute breaks during the debate, at around 22:00 and 22:30, and our data here has 15-minute granularity.\n\nThere\u2019s a clear difference between this second debate, with a drop of up to 9%, and the first one between Biden and Trump on June 27, when the traffic dropped just 2% below the same time a week prior. Interestingly, the biggest drop occurred at the same time in both debates, right after they started, at 21:15 EST (01:15 UTC).\n\nInternet traffic dips across US states\n\nTraffic shifts at the time of the debate, as compared to the previous week, can reveal more detail at a state-level perspective than at the country level. The map below summarizes traffic changes observed at a state level. A key observation is that traffic declines at a state level were much more pronounced during the Harris-Trump debate, than during the Biden-Trump debate in late June.\n\n(Source: Cloudflare; created with Datawrapper)\n\nThe most significant traffic drops were observed in Vermont (-25%), Montana (-22%), and Idaho (-19%). More populous states such as California (-11%), Texas (-10%), and New York (-14%) also experienced notable declines in traffic.\n\nJust for comparison, here\u2019s the state map from that June 27 Biden-Trump debate:\n\n(Source: Cloudflare; created with Datawrapper)\n\nThe initial minutes of the Harris-Trump debate triggered the largest traffic declines in most states, at least up until the first break, at around 21:30 ET (01:30 UTC).\n\nIn the next table, we provide a detailed breakdown of the same perspective shown on the US map ordered by the magnitude of the drop in traffic. We include the time of the biggest traffic drop compared to the previous week, at a 5-minute granularity, and also the percentage of the drop compared to the previous week. As noted above, the largest declines appeared to occur earlier in the debate.\n\nState Drop in traffic (%) Local Time UTC Vermont -25% 21:05 EDT 1:05 Montana -22% 19:10 MDT 1:10 Idaho -19% 19:10 MDT 1:10 Wyoming -19% 19:15 MDT 1:15 North Dakota -18% 20:15 CDT 1:15 Delaware -15% 21:20 EDT 1:20 Illinois -15% 20:20 CDT 1:20 Mississippi -14% 20:05 CDT 1:05 New York -14% 21:05 EDT 1:05 Rhode Island -14% 21:45 EDT 1:45 West Virginia -14% 21:15 EDT 1:15 Alabama -13% 20:05 CDT 1:05 Georgia -13% 21:20 EDT 1:20 South Carolina -13% 21:15 EDT 1:15 Virginia -13% 21:15 EDT 1:15 Colorado -12% 19:45 MDT 1:45 Connecticut -12% 21:05 EDT 1:05 Nevada -12% 18:20 PDT 1:20 New Jersey -12% 21:20 EDT 1:20 Alaska -11% 17:15 AKDT 1:15 California -11% 18:15 PDT 1:15 Florida -11% 21:05 EDT 1:05 North Carolina -11% 21:05 EDT 1:05 Wisconsin -11% 20:20 CDT 1:20 Arkansas -10% 20:05 CDT 1:05 District of Columbia -10% 21:55 EDT 1:55 Missouri -10% 20:25 CDT 1:25 Oregon -10% 18:40 PDT 1:40 Pennsylvania -10% 21:05 EDT 1:05 South Dakota -10% 20:20 CDT 1:20 Texas -10% 20:05 CDT 1:05 Maryland -9% 21:20 EDT 1:20 Massachusetts -9% 21:20 EDT 1:20 New Hampshire -9% 21:05 EDT 1:05 Oklahoma -9% 20:05 CDT 1:05 Arizona -8% 18:15 MST 1:15 Indiana -8% 21:05 EDT 1:05 Iowa -8% 20:05 CDT 1:05 Kentucky -8% 21:05 EDT 1:05 Maine -8% 21:15 EDT 1:15 Nebraska -8% 19:45 MDT 1:45 Kansas -7% 20:25 CDT 1:25 Louisiana -7% 20:20 CDT 1:20 Michigan -7% 21:20 EDT 1:20 Minnesota -7% 20:30 CDT 1:30 New Mexico -7% 19:25 MDT 1:25 Washington -7% 18:05 PDT 1:05 Hawaii -6% 15:20 HST 1:20 Ohio -6% 21:15 EDT 1:15 Tennessee -6% 20:05 CDT 1:05 Utah -6% 19:10 MDT 1:10\n\nSwing state drops in traffic higher than first debate\n\nThe seven swing states that are said to be decisive in the election \u2014 Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin \u2014 each saw traffic drop between 8% and 13%, which is more than during the Biden-Trump debate (between 5% and 8% at that time). Here\u2019s a more focused view of those swing states for easier visualization:\n\nState Drop in traffic Local Time UTC Arizona -8% 18:15 MST 1:15 Georgia -13% 21:20 EDT 1:20 Michigan -7% 21:20 EDT 1:20 Nevada -12% 18:20 PDT 1:20 North Carolina -11% 21:05 EDT 1:05 Pennsylvania -10% 21:05 EDT 1:05 Wisconsin -11% 20:20 CDT 1:20\n\nDNS trends\n\nShifting our attention to domain trends, our 1.1.1.1 resolver data highlights a more targeted impact during and around the debate. Let\u2019s start with Kamala Harris-related insights.\n\nHarris and the Taylor Swift effect\n\nSince July 21, the date of Biden\u2019s withdrawal and endorsement of Harris, daily DNS traffic to Harris-related domains has significantly increased, with notable peaks on August 30 (the day after the Harris-Walz interview on CNN) and September 10 (the debate with Trump).\n\nFrom an hourly perspective, the impact of the debate on Kamala Harris-related sites is evident, with increased DNS traffic throughout the day (September 10). The peak occurred at the debate's start (21:00 ET / 01:00 UTC) with a 54% increase from the previous week, and again after it ended (23:00 ET / 03:00 UTC) with a 56% rise. This spike coincided with Taylor Swift's endorsement of Kamala Harris.\n\nTrump and the Elon Musk interview effect\n\nDonald Trump, having a longer-standing campaign and websites compared to Kamala Harris, shows different trends. Aggregated daily DNS traffic to Trump-related domains has also increased in recent months. Significant peaks were observed on July 15 (two days after the assassination attempt ), then during the Republican National Convention (July 15-18), with the highest spike occurring on August 12, following Elon Musk's interview with Trump on X.\n\nHourly data shows the debate\u2019s impact on Trump-related sites with a noticeable increase around the debate's start (21:00 ET / 01:00 UTC), where DNS traffic was 46% higher than the previous week. This elevated traffic continued for a few hours, after the debate ended.\n\nFrom news to election-related sites\n\nLike previous US election-related events, the debate generated significant interest in US news organizations, leading to a rise in aggregated DNS traffic to general US news sites. This increase peaked during the debate at 22:00 ET (02:00 UTC), with DNS traffic 62% higher than the previous week. The elevated DNS traffic began before the debate and persisted afterward, with a 19% increase at 20:00 ET (00:00 UTC) and a 25% increase at 00:00 ET (04:00 UTC).\n\nMicroblogging social platforms like X or Threads outperformed their previous week\u2019s traffic throughout the debate, peaking at 16% growth around 22:00 ET (02:00 UTC).\n\nAdditionally, there was a notable increase in DNS traffic to election-related websites, including official voting registration and election sites. During the morning of September 10 in the US, DNS traffic was 38% higher at 10:00 ET (14:00 UTC), with a significant spike at 23:00 ET (03:00 UTC) right after the debate, where DNS traffic surged by 76% compared to the previous week.\n\nHarris-Trump: spam and malicious emails\n\nFrom a cybersecurity perspective, trending events , topics, and individuals often attract more emails, including malicious, phishing, and spam messages. Our earlier analysis covered email trends involving \u201cJoe Biden\u201d and \u201cDonald Trump\u201d since January. We\u2019ve since updated it to include Kamala Harris after the Democratic Convention .\n\nFrom June 1, 2024, through August 21, Cloudflare\u2019s Cloud Email Security service processed over 16 million emails that included the names \u201cDonald Trump\u201d, \u201cJoe Biden\u201d, or \u201cKamala Harris\u201d in the subject, with 8.7 million referencing Trump, 4.8 million referencing Biden, and 3 million referencing Harris.\n\nThe chart below highlights a surge in emails mentioning Trump in mid-July, contrasting with a drop in the number of emails mentioning Biden in the subject and an increase in emails mentioning Harris.\n\nSince July 21, following changes in the presumptive Democratic candidate, over 4.5 million emails mentioned \u201cDonald Trump,\u201d over 1.5 million mentioned \u201cJoe Biden,\u201d and around 2.8 million mentioned \u201cKamala Harris\u201d in the subject. Of these, 26.7% of emails with Trump\u2019s name were classified as spam, and 2.4% were classified as malicious. For Kamala Harris, 1.1% were classified as spam and 0.2% were classified as malicious, while Biden\u2019s figures were 1.1% for spam and 0.1% for malicious.\n\nSince mid-August, there has been a slight increase in the percentage of spam and malicious emails mentioning Kamala Harris. Trump remains the candidate with the most mentions in email subjects and the highest percentages of emails classified as spam and malicious.\n\nSeptember attacks on political and news sites\n\nIn our blog posts about several of the 2024 elections , we have noted that attacks on politically-related websites have remained a significant threat this year. In Europe, we\u2019ve seen political parties and associated websites targeted around elections . We previously reported on DDoS attacks around the Republican National Convention and Democratic National Convention .\n\nIn our post about the Democratic National Convention , we showed that during late July and August, Cloudflare blocked DDoS attacks targeting three US politically related organizations, including a site associated with one of the major parties, with attacks occurring just before the Democratic Convention.\n\nThe largest DDoS attack recorded in recent days against politically-related websites targeted specifically a US political-party related website on September 4, peaking at 140,000 requests per second (rps) and lasting about 5 minutes.\n\nBut it\u2019s not only US politically-related websites that could be the target of cyber attacks. News organizations are often attacked during relevant events, as we saw during the first year of the war in Ukraine , for example. Already in September, we\u2019ve seen an example of a relevant US news organization that covers politics being the target of a DDoS attack on September 3, peaking at 343,000 requests per second (rps) and lasting about 5 minutes.\n\nAs highlighted in our Q2 DDoS report , most DDoS attacks are short-lived, as exemplified by the two mentioned attacks. Also, 81% of HTTP DDoS attacks peak at under 50,000 requests per second (rps), and only 7% reach between 100,000 and 250,000 rps. While a 140,000 rps attack might seem minor to Cloudflare, it can be devastating for websites not equipped to handle such high levels of traffic.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this analysis of the Harris-Trump debate, we\u2019ve observed that the September 10 debate caused bigger drops in traffic in the US than the Biden-Trump debate in late June. There was also a noticeable increase in DNS traffic to both Kamala Harris-related and Donald Trump-related domains, as well as to US news media outlets and election-related domains \u2014 in this case, right after the debate ended.",

        "text": "How Kamala Harris won the U.S. presidential debate against Donald Trump\nBy any conventional measure, United States Vice President Kamala Harris resoundingly beat Donald Trump in their first presidential showdown.\n\nOf the two politicians on the stage in Philadelphia, Harris faced the steeper challenge \u2014 she needed to reintroduce herself to the American public in her new role, defend the record of President Joe Biden and at the same time differentiate herself as a candidate. She simultaneously had to frame the stakes of the election and prosecute the case against her opponent.\n\nTo varying extents, she accomplished all of these aims, summing up her argument in an oft-repeated and optimistic request that Americans turn the page with her on the ugliness of the Trump years.\n\nSeizing the initiative\n\nFrom the outset, it was clear Harris was very well prepared, coming to the stage with a plan and an arsenal of points to be made.\n\nConfidently crossing the stage to where Trump stood, she extended her hand and cheerfully introduced herself, setting the tone for a night in which Harris frequently seized the initiative.\n\nAP Photo/Alex Brandon)\n\nIt was in fact remarkable how Harris routinely made Trump visibly uncomfortable, something rarely seen happening to the former president on the public stage.\n\nAgain and again, Harris launched barbs that compelled Trump to exaggerate or make ludicrous claims, frequently flailing in his responses. A quip about crowd sizes at his rallies, for example, provoked a predictable boast about his events \u2014 \u201cthe most incredible rallies in the history of politics\u201d \u2014 and set off a rhetorical meltdown from which Trump never truly recovered.\n\n\u2018Fired by 81 million Americans\u2019\n\nWhen Harris recited a list of Trump advisers who have become his harshest critics, Trump argued he\u2019d fired them all, setting up one of her most cutting lines of the night as Harris pointed out the former president had been fired by 81 million Americans in the last election.\n\nThat reinforced her message that it was time for Americans to turn the page and keep moving forward while also reminding them about Trump\u2019s false claims that he won the 2020 election.\n\nTrump found moments to attack, pressing Harris on the Biden administration\u2019s role in approving the Nord Stream pipeline between Russia and Europe.\n\nBut quite often his anger seemed to overstep the mark as he made false and ludicrous claims about windmills and solar power, babies being executed after birth and Haitian migrants eating family pets in Springfield, Ohio.\n\nSuch conspiratorial tones, while unchallenged in his rallies, seemed out of place and unpresidential, especially as Harris often openly laughed at him.\n\nA bad night for Trump\n\nOf course, these are not conventional times, and so the spin that follows within America\u2019s sharply divided media ecosystem will ultimately prove at least as important in determining the debate\u2019s long-term impact.\n\nMedia coverage suggests Republicans in general, and Trump in particular, felt the night did not go their way. Trump and his supporters have trotted out a variety of explanations and excuses, pointing to supportive online and unscientific polls, attacking the moderators and even floating a baseless conspiracy theory that Harris knew the questions in advance.\n\n(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\n\nPreparation, however, is no conspiracy.\n\nStepping back, such denial once again underscores the true stakes of the election. For a democratic system to survive, as scholars of democracy have observed, candidates have to be willing to lose.\n\nAs Harris pointed out, Trump continuously indicates that he cannot recognize a loss when he has suffered one \u2014 and is not willing to play by democratic rules and norms, both written and unwritten.\n\nAmericans will have to decide in November whether they are indeed ready to turn the page on that approach to politics.\n\nThis is a corrected version of a story originally published on Sept. 11, 2024. The original incorrectly made reference to the Nordstar pipeline; in fact, it is the Nord Stream pipeline.",

        "text": "Takeaways from the ABC presidential debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris\nPhiladelphia CNN \u2014\n\nKamala Harris baited Donald Trump for nearly all of the 1 hour and 45 minutes of their first and potentially only debate on Tuesday night \u2013 and Trump took every bit of it.\n\nThe vice president had prepared extensively for their debate, and peppered nearly every answer with a comment designed to enrage the former president. She told Trump that world leaders were laughing at him, and military leaders called him a \u201cdisgrace.\u201d She called Trump \u201cweak\u201d and \u201cwrong.\u201d She said Trump was fired by 81 million voters \u2013 the number that voted for President Joe Biden in 2020.\n\n\u201cClearly, he\u2019s having a very difficult time processing that,\u201d she said.\n\nTrump was often out of control. He loudly and repeatedly insisted that a whole host of falsehoods were true. The former president repeated lies about widespread fraud in the 2020 election. He parroted a conspiracy theory about immigrants eating pets, and lied about Democrats supporting abortions after babies are born \u2013 which is murder, and illegal everywhere.\n\nHe painted a dire picture of the United States, reminiscent of the \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d he\u2019d warned of when he was inaugurated in 2017.\n\n\u201cWe have a nation that is dying,\u201d Trump said Tuesday night.\n\nAs the debate ended, Harris got another boost: Musician and pop culture icon Taylor Swift posted on Instagram that she was backing the Democratic ticket. She signed her post \u201cTaylor Swift, Childless Cat Lady\u201d \u2014 a reference to controversial comments by Trump\u2019s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, that have alienated many women.\n\nHarris speaks during a presidential debate with Trump on Tuesday in Philadelphia. Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images\n\nHere are some quick takeaways from the first portion of the debate:\n\nA turning point when Harris jabs Trump over the size of his rally crowds\n\nHarris came onstage with a clear plan: Throw Trump off his game.\n\nIt was, by any measure, a dramatic success. When the vice president mentioned Trump\u2019s criminal conviction and outstanding legal issues, he bit. When she called him out for sinking a bipartisan immigration bill, he bit harder. And when Harris suggested Trump\u2019s rallies were boring, he nearly choked on the bait.\n\nRather than engage on the issues raised by the moderators, including a few that Trump considers some of his political strengths, the former president went on at length about the entertainment value of his rallies, claims the Biden administration was legally targeting him and, in a long, bizarre spell, insisted \u2013 against all available evidence, that migrants were eating Americans\u2019 pets.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re eating the dogs, the people that came in, they\u2019re eating the cats, they\u2019re eating the pets of the people that live there,\u201d Trump said, after Harris criticized him for tanking the immigration bill.\n\nHarris looked on as though she was puzzled, but rarely returned to the claims, apparently content to allow Trump go off.\n\nTrump seemed especially aggrieved by the vice president\u2019s aside about his campaign events. Even after Muir sought to redirect the debate to immigration \u2013 again, one of Trump\u2019s preferred topics \u2013 the former president refused to let it go.\n\n\u201cFirst, let me respond as to the rallies,\u201d Trump said, mocking Harris\u2019 crowds before returning to his own. \u201cPeople don\u2019t leave my rallies, we have the biggest rallies, the most incredible rallies in the history of politics.\u201d\n\nThe first hour of the debate then ended much like it began \u2013 with Trump off on a long, narrowcast tangent about the 2020 election, which he claimed, falsely once again, was stolen from him.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Trump to Harris: 'I'm talking now' 00:32 - Source: CNN\n\nTrump traffics in conspiracy theories\n\nDespite signals from even his running mate, Trump did not refrain from repeating the conspiracy theory du jour during the debate.\n\nThe former president brought up the unfounded conspiracy theory that migrants from Haiti living in Springfield, Ohio, are eating people\u2019s cats and dogs.\n\nHe said at one point \u201cin Springfield, they\u2019re eating the dogs. They\u2019re eating the cats. They\u2019re eating the pets of people who live there.\u201d\n\nWhen ABC News moderator David Muir pointed out that city officials denied any evidence that migrants in Springfield were actually eating pets, Trump doubled down, saying \u201cthe people on television\u201d were saying it. When pressed, Trump just said, \u201cWe\u2019ll find out.\u201d\n\nWhen the debate moved to crime, Trump claimed that crime was up in the United States contrary to the rest of the world. There too Muir pointed out that, according to FBI data, crime had actually declined in the past few years.\n\nTrump, again, deferred to a different conspiracy theory that the FBI is deeply corrupt and issuing \u201cdefrauding statements.\u201d He argued \u201cit was a fraud.\u201d\n\nLater in the debate, Trump argued that US elections are \u201ca mess\u201d and claimed that Democrats are trying to get undocumented immigrants to vote in elections.\n\nTrump speaks during the presidential debate with Harris in Philadelphia on Tuesday. Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images\n\nFew moments highlighted the difference between Biden\u2019s June debate performance and Harris\u2019 on Tuesday as much as the abortion debate.\n\nThe vice president, who has long been one the administration\u2019s strongest surrogates on reproductive rights, was able to respond to the former president\u2019s defense of his abortion policy in a way Biden was not.\n\nThe former president, who appointed three of the Supreme Court judges who overturned federal abortion protections, has sought to moderate his stance on the issue by criticizing six-week abortion bans and reiterating his support for exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother. But he has also defended the overturning of Roe v. Wade.\n\n\u201cNow it\u2019s not tied up in the federal government,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI did a great service in doing it. It took courage to do it.\u201d\n\nTrump repeated several of the arguments he made about abortion during his June debate with Biden. He argued that \u201ceveryone\u201d wanted the issue returned to the states, despite widespread resistance from Democrats and some independents. He argued inaccurately that a former governor of Virginia said that babies should be executed \u2013 a reference to comments former Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam, a doctor, made about care for births after nonviable pregnancies.\n\nAnd Trump repeated the false claim that some states allow abortions to be performed after a baby has been born, which drew a fact check from ABC News\u2019 Linsey Davis.\n\n\u201cThere is no state in this country where it is legal to kill a baby after it\u2019s born,\u201d Davis said.\n\nHarris responded by highlighting cases where women have been unable to get abortions after being victims of rape or struggled to get miscarriage care.\n\n\u201cYou want to talk about this is what people wanted?\u201d Harris said. \u201cPregnant women who want to carry a pregnancy to term, suffering from a miscarriage, being denied care in an emergency room because the health care providers are afraid they might go to jail, and she\u2019s bleeding out in a car in the parking lot \u2013 she didn\u2019t want that.\u201d\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Trump was asked why women should support him on abortion. See his response 05:12 - Source: CNN\n\nVice president casts Trump as out for himself\n\nSeeking to introduce herself to voters, Harris set the tone early, drawing contrast with Trump by framing herself as an advocate for middle-class Americans \u2013 and framing her opponent as self-absorbed.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump has no plan for you,\u201d Harris said in response to a question on the economy, looking into the camera in a direct appeal to voters.\n\nLeaning into her personal biography as she cast herself as a \u201cmiddle class kid,\u201d Harris outlined an economic vision including tax cuts for families and tax deductions for small businesses, while Trump, she said, will \u201cdo what he has done before, which is to provide a tax cut for billionaires and big corporations.\u201d\n\nTrump, Harris continued, \u201cactually has no plan for you, because he is more interested in defending himself than he is in looking out for you.\u201d\n\nHer campaign has argued in its ads and talking points that Trump is a candidate looking out for himself, and Harris took that message to the debate stage Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI will tell you, the one thing you will not hear him talk about is you. And I\u2019ll tell you: I believe you deserve a president who actually puts you first,\u201d she said.\n\nA handshake sets the tone\n\nWhen Harris and Trump walked onto stage in Philadelphia, it was the first time they\u2019d met in person. Trump, after all, skipped Biden\u2019s inauguration.\n\nHarris set the tone by walking across the six feet separating her podium from Trump\u2019s and reaching out for a handshake. She introduced herself and said, \u201cLet\u2019s have a good debate.\u201d\n\n\u201cNice to see you,\u201d Trump responded.\n\nIt was the first handshake in a presidential debate since Trump and Hillary Clinton squared off in 2016. Trump famously loomed uncomfortably close to Clinton during their town hall-style debate.\n\nTrump generally looked forward as Harris spoke, while the vice president communicated through facial expressions. She laughed at some Trump comments, smirked at others, shook her head at some and at times appeared bemused.\n\nWhen Trump repeated a debunked myth about Haitian immigrants eating pets in Springfield, Ohio, Harris laughed mockingly while shrugging and pointing at Trump.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Trump says he 'couldn't care less' about Harris' race. Hear her response 02:53 - Source: CNN\n\nWhen Trump was asked about his comment last month falsely claiming Harris only recently started to identify as Black, the former president defended his remarks as something he\u2019d read somewhere.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t care less,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWhatever she wants to be is OK with me.\u201d\n\nIn the weeks since those comments, the vice president has avoided engaging in that personal attack beyond calling it the \u201csame old tired playbook.\u201d\n\nAt the Philadelphia event, however, Harris responded to Trump\u2019s attacks on her identity a meaningful way. But instead of defending her indisputable racial identity, the vice president laid out the former president\u2019s history of past racial discrimination and racist behavior.\n\nThat history includes investigations of housing discrimination, calling for the death penalty for the Central Park Five \u2013 young teenagers of color falsely accused and convicted of raping and assaulting a woman in the New York park \u2013 and fueling the false birther allegation that former President Barack Obama was not born in the United states.\n\n\u201cAnd I think the American people want better than that. Want better than this,\u201d Harris said. \u201cWe see in each other a friend. We see in each other a neighbor. We don\u2019t want a leader who is constantly trying to have Americans point their fingers at each other.\u201d\n\nTrump pushed back, arguing that others, such as former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, also supported the case against the Central Park Five. He called the Biden-Harris administration divisive and argued that the vice president\u2019s examples were outdated.\n\n\u201cThis is a person that has to stretch back years \u2013 40, 50 years ago \u2013 because there\u2019s nothing now,\u201d he said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Harris reacts to Trump doubling down on debunked rumors about immigrants eating pets 03:20 - Source: CNN\n\nTrump and Harris dig their heels in on major global flashpoints\n\nIf anyone on stage Tuesday has a clear, point-by-point plan for ending the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, they did not share it with the viewers at home.\n\nAsked how she would secure peace in Gaza, Harris first recalled the horrors of Hamas\u2019 October 7, 2023, attacks inside Israel. She offered some mild criticism of Israel\u2019s response, an ongoing bombardment that\u2019s killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, before pivoting to her support for a two-state solution, Israel\u2019s right to defend itself and a commitment to rebuilding Gaza.\n\n\u201cWe need a ceasefire deal and we need the hostages out,\u201d Harris declared. Biden and others recently conceded such an agreement is a long way off.\n\nTrump offered even fewer details.\n\n\u201cShe hates Israel,\u201d he said of Harris, adding that she also hates \u201cArabs.\u201d\n\nTrump has occasionally sought to inflame anger among Arab Americans over Biden\u2019s handling of the conflict. But on Tuesday he quickly abandoned the tactic, instead chiding Harris for slighting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a recent visit to Capitol Hill \u2013 she did, in fact, meet with him; she did not attend his speech to Congress \u2013 and declaring again that none of it \u201cwould have never happened\u201d if he were still in the White House.\n\nDitto for the Russian war in Ukraine, per the former president, who \u2013 after stopping to note that he \u201cknow(s) Putin very well \u2013 said \u201cRussia would have never ever \u2026 have gone into Ukraine\u201d on his watch.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll get it done before even becoming president,\u201d Trump added, claiming his election would reset the geopolitical state of play and, almost by definition, herald a deal.\n\nHarris, for her part, used the Russia-Ukraine talk to attack Trump over his well-documented fondness for international strongmen and despots.\n\n\u201cIt is well-known that these dictators and autocrats are rooting for you to be president again,\u201d Harris said, \u201cbecause it is so clear they can manipulate you with flatter and favors.\u201d\n\nTrump fought back there, recalling his push to get NATO member nations to pay more into the alliance and slamming Harris for Biden\u2019s refusal to do the same, before saying the vice president \u201cdoes not have the courage to ask.\u201d\n\nA countdown clock over debate moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis shows how much time former President Donald Trump has left to answer a question during Tuesday\u2019s debate with Vice President Kamala Harris.

And in so doing, she added, endangering Poland on Ukraine\u2019s western border. (Pennsylvania has a large Polish-American population, Harris noted.)\n\nTrump repeatedly brought up the administration\u2019s handling of the US\u2019 withdrawal from Afghanistan, arguing it showed weakness in the White House and that Biden did not fire enough people in response to it. Harris said she agreed with Biden\u2019s decision to pull US troops out of Afghanistan in 2021, asserting that Trump \u201cnegotiated one of the weakest deals you can imagine\u201d on the matter during his time as president.\n\nTrump \u2013 having been accused repeatedly of going starry-eyed for strongmen \u2013 quoted the one running Hungary, Prime Minister Viktor Orban.\n\n\u201cOrban said it, he said, \u2018The most respected, most feared person is Donald Trump. We had no problems when Trump was president,\u2019\u201d Trump said.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.",

        "text": "Presidential debate replay: Harris puts Trump on defensive over Jan. 6, race relations, abortion\nFormer President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris met for the first time on Tuesday \u2212 facing off in a heated showdown on the 2024 debate stage.\n\nThe Democratic and Republican nominees laid out their visions for the country, discussing issues ranging from inflation and the economy to abortion rights and the southern border. They walked through their proposals \u2212 and criticized their opponent \u2212 all while trying to win over pivotal swing voters who could ultimately decide the election.\n\nWhile Trump and Harris went back and forth on the issues, they also took personal jabs. Harris zeroed in on the crowd sizes at Trump's rallies, and the former president joked that he was going to send the vice president one of his well-known red hats based on her current stances.\n\nCatch up with the USA TODAY Network's live coverage of the Trump-Harris debate.\n\nWhat's true?

Harris' aggressive performance rattles a defensive Trump.\n\nDonald Trump knocked Joe Biden out of the 2024 presidential race in the last debate, but the Republican found himself repeatedly knocked on his heels Tuesday night when squaring off against his new opponent: Kamala Harris.\n\nTrump was on the defensive over his legal problems, election denialism, opposition from former allies and incitement of an attack on the U.S. Capitol. Even his beloved rallies become debate fodder, with Harris mocking them as full of odd digressions and so boring his supporters often leave early.\n\nHarris came in trying to rattle and bait Trump, and often succeeded, leading to defensive, angry and rambling responses as the vice president had the upper hand throughout much of the contest. Trump repeatedly turned to immigration, his signature issue, but struggled to sustain a consistent line of attack and often leaned on familiar and false claims that drew corrections from the moderators.\n\n\u2212 Zac Anderson\n\nTaylor Swift endorses Kamala Harris for president: 'She is a steady-handed, gifted leader'\n\nTaylor Swift is endorsing Kamala Harris in the upcoming presidential election, the pop star revealed Tuesday night following the presidential debate between Harris and former President Donald Trump.\n\nIn an Instagram post shared following the debate, Swift wrote in a caption of a photo of her with her cat that she \"will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.\"\n\n\"Like many of you, I watched the debate tonight. If you haven\u2019t already, now is a great time to do your research on the issues at hand and the stances these candidates take on the topics that matter to you the most. As a voter, I make sure to watch and read everything I can about their proposed policies and plans for this country,\" Swift wrote.\n\n\u2212 Anika Reed and Bryan West\n\nTrump's closing statement: 'Why hasn't she done it?'\n\nTrump, who got to go last because he won a coin flip before the debate, used his closing statement to attack Harris for not already accomplishing her goals during the three-and-a-half years of the Biden-Harris administration.\n\n\"Why hasn't she done it?\" Trump said at one point.\n\nHe continued in a negative vein, saying the U.S. is \"a failing nation\" that is in \"decline\" because of Biden and Harris.He didn't delve deeply into his own policy proposals.\n\n\u2212David Jackson\n\nWill there be a second Trump-Harris debate? Harris campaign calls for second showdown\n\nIt's not clear whether Donald Trump and Kamala Harris will debate again, but the vice president's campaign called for a second debate against Trump moments after Tuesday's showdown ended.\n\n\u201cUnder the bright lights, the American people got to see the choice they will face this fall at the ballot box: between moving forward with Kamala Harris, or going backwards with Trump. That\u2019s what they saw tonight and what they should see at a second debate in October. Vice President Harris is ready for a second debate. Is Donald Trump?\u201d Harris-Walz Campaign Chair Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon said in a statement.\n\n\u2212 Rebecca Morin and Marina Pitofsky\n\nHarris\u2019 closing message: I\u2019ll be a president for all Americans\n\nHarris\u2019 final message to viewers of the debate: we can chart \u201ca new way forward\u201d for the country together. In her closing remarks, Harris argued that she is focused on the future, and Trump is focused on the past.\n\nHer vision for the country includes an economy that helps families, small businesses, seniors and working-class Americans, Harris said. Harris added that she would protect Americans' rights and freedoms and be a president for everyone, regardless of their political affiliation.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s the kind of president we need right now. Someone who cares about you and is not putting themselves first,\u201d Harris said.\n\n\u2013 Francesca Chambers\n\nHarris to Trump: 'Clearly, I\u2019m not Joe Biden'\n\nTrump sought to drag down Harris by arguing that she and President Joe Biden are one in the same.\n\n\u201cShe is Biden,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s trying to get away from Biden. I don\u2019t know the gentleman, she says.\u201d\n\nHarris has never claimed that she does not know Biden. But she stressed in a rebuttal that they have different approaches. \u201cClearly I am not Joe Biden. And I am certainly not Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cAnd what I do offer is a new generation of leadership for our country, one who believes in what is possible, one who brings a sense of optimism about what we can do, instead of always disparaging the American people,\u201d she said, turning to Trump.\n\n\u2013 Francesca Chambers\n\nTrump pressed on his comments about Harris' biracial identity\n\nWhen questioned about why he thought it was appropriate to question Harris' biracial identity, Trump said he doesn't care.\n\n\"I don't care. You make a big deal out of something, I couldn't care less. Whatever she wants to be is okay with me.\"\n\nThe former president's July appearance at the National Association of Black Journalists' convention sparked backlash after he accused Harris of becoming Black after he claimed she had only identified as Indian-American up until recently. Harris' father is Black and her mother was Indian-American.\n\n\"I mean all I can say is, I read when she was not Black, that she put out, and, I'll say that, and then I read that she was Black, and that's okay, either one was okay with me,\" he said. \"That's up to her, that's up to her.\" In response, Harris called Trump's comments a \"tragedy.\"\n\n\u2212 Sam Woodward\n\nKamala Harris says she's a gun owner\n\nAfter Donald Trump criticized Kamala Harris' stance on gun control, she noted that she and her running mate, Tim Walz, are both gun owners.\n\n\u2212 Marina Pitofsky\n\nTrump and Harris argue about Afghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump sought to tag Harris with the botched 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan, during which 13 American service members were killed in a bombing.\n\n\"They never fired one person,\" Trump said, calling it \"the most embarrassing moment\" in the nation's history.\n\nHarris wasn't having it, saying the problems with the withdrawal resulted from a weak deal with the Taliban negotiated by President Donald Trump.\n\n\u2212David Jackson\n\nTrump says Harris 'hates Israel'; VP says it\u2019s 'not true'\n\nHarris said the war between Israel and Hamas \u201cmust end immediately\u201d with a cease-fire deal and hostage release. She recommitted to giving Israel the ability to defend itself \u2013 especially from Iran \u2013 but she said there must be a solution that establishes an independent Palestinian state.\n\nTrump insisted that if he were president, Hamas would not have launched a vicious attack on Israel on Oct. 7.\n\n\u201cShe hates Israel,\u201d Trump charged.\n\nHe knocked Harris for skipping Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s speech to Congress over the summer to deliver a speech to a historically Black sorority. He repeated a claim\n\n\u201cAt the same time, in her own way, she hates the Arab population,\u201d he added, \u201cbecause the whole place is going to get blown up. Arabs, Jewish people, Israel, Israel will be gone.\u201d Harris said \u201cthat\u2019s absolutely not true\u201d and that Trump is \u201ctrying to divide and distract\u201d from his \u201cweak and wrong\u201d on national security and foreign policy.\n\n\u201cIt is well known that he admires dictators, wants to be a dictator on day one,\u201d she said, hammering Trump for a comment he made about Russian President Vladimir Putin doing \u201cwhatever the hell\u201d he wants in Ukraine.\n\nTrump fired back that Putin wants Harris to win the election.\n\n\u2212 Francesca Chambers\n\nHarris to disaffected Republicans: There's a place for you in our campaign\n\nHarris leaned into her background as a prosecutor to establish a pattern of behavior from Trump that she hopes will win over disaffected Republicans.\n\nJanuary 6 was \u201cnot an isolated\u201d incident, she said. His statement that there were \u201cvery fine people\u201d on both sides of a clash with white supremacists in Charlottesville and a directive to the Proud Boys to \u201cstand back and stand by,\u201d preceded the Capitol riot.\n\n\u201cIf that was a bridge too far for you, well there is a place in our campaign for you, to stand for country, to stand for our democracy, to stand for rule of law, and to end the chaos and to end the approach that is about attacking the foundations of our democracy, because you don\u2019t like the outcome,\u201d Harris said.\n\n\u2013 Francesca Chambers\n\nHarris says \u2018world leaders are laughing\u2019 at Trump; Trump references Viktor Orba\u0301n\n\nFollowing Trump\u2019s false claim that the 2020 election was corrupt, Harris said leaders across the world are \u201claughing\u201d at the former president.\n\n\u201cI'm going to tell you that I have traveled the world as vice president of the United States and world leaders are laughing at Donald Trump,\u201d she said. \u201cI have talked with military leaders, some of whom work with you, and they say you are a disgrace.\u201d\n\nTrump pushed back on Harris\u2019 claim, saying that Prime Minister of Hungary Viktor Orba\u0301n said the United States\u2019 \u201cneed Trump back as president.\u201d\n\n\u201cViktor Orba\u0301n said, he said, \u2018the most respected, most feared person is Donald Trump. We had no problems when Trump was president,\u2019\u201d Trump said, calling Biden a \u201cweak, pathetic man.\u201d\n\n\u2212 Rebecca Morin\n\nTrump uses the term 'we' when discussing Jan. 6 rioters\n\nTrump said he had nothing to do with the violence perpetrated by the insurrectionist rioters of Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nHe may have undercut his case when he used the term \"we\" while talking about the events surrounding the attack on the Capitol.\n\n\u2212David Jackson\n\nTrump insists he 'won' in 2020 (despite past comments to the contrary)\n\nTrump insisted he still believes he \"won\" the 2020 election, even though he said in recent days that he lost by a \"whisker\" because of voter turnout. Trump's explanation for the \"whisker\" comment: \"That was said sarcastically.\"\n\nHarris, meanwhile, said there is not doubt he lost: \"Donald Trump was fired by 81 million people.\"\n\n\u2212David Jackson\n\nHarris harnesses prosecutor vs. felon rhetoric\n\nWhen answering a question about immigration rates and crime, Harris took a dig at Trump's own criminal record.\n\n\"I think this is so rich coming from someone who has been prosecuted for national security crimes, economic crimes, election interference, has been found liable for sexual assault, and his next big court appearance is in November at his own criminal sentencing,\" Harris said.\n\nLast week, New York Judge Juan Merchan granted Trump's request for a delay in his sentencing for his 34 felony convictions regarding hush money payments paid to former porn star Stormy Daniels.\n\n\"The former vice president called for defunding federal law enforcement, 45,000 agents, get this, on the day after he was arraigned for 34 felony counts,\" she said.\n\n\u2212 Sam Woodward\n\n'Does that sound familiar?'\n\nBoth candidates are getting their pre-planned zingers. When Harris started to interrupt Trump, he shot back \"I'm talking now\" - similar to the line she used on Mike Pence in the 2020 vice presidential debate.\n\n\"Does that sound familiar?\" Trump said to Harris.\n\nHarris, meanwhile, has twice said that voters are sick of Trump's \"tired, old playbook.\"\n\n\u2212 David Jackson\n\nTrump falsely claims he was prosecuted by Democrats, efforts fueled assassination attempt\n\nTrump on Tuesday falsely said Harris was involved in the four criminal cases against him. There is no evidence Harris had involvement in the charges the former president faces.\n\nTrump also claimed that he \"probably took a bullet to the heat\" due to Democratic lies about him. There is no evidence the man who attempted to assassinate Trump was motivated by his criminal cases.\n\n\u2212 Marina Pitofsky\n\nHarris claims no flip-flop on fracking\n\nHarris said she made it clear in 2020 that she does not support banning fracking.\n\n\u201cI have not banned fracking as Vice President of the United States, and in fact, I was the tie breaking vote on the inflation Reduction Act, which opened new leases for fracking,\u201d Harris said.\n\nIn 2019 when she was first running for president, Harris said she was in favor of banning fracking, as well as sponsored the Green New Deal as Senator. But in the 2024 election, Harris\u2019 campaign has said she is no longer in favor.\n\nHarris said at the debate that her position is to invest in diverse sources of energy and reduce U.S. reliance on foreign oil: \u201cWe have had the largest increase in domestic oil production in history because of an approach that recognizes that we cannot over rely on foreign oil,\u201d Harris said.\n\n\u2212Rebecca Morin\n\nTrump makes false comments about people eating dogs and cats\n\nTrump on Tuesday mentioned a false claim that there have been reports of immigrants eating dogs and cats in Springfield, Ohio. There are no credible reports of that happening.\n\n\u2212 Marina Pitofsky\n\nHarris: A lot of Republicans prefer me over Trump\n\nHarris seized the opportunity to talk about all the Republicans who have condemned him and endorsed her, a list that runs from former Vice President Dick Cheney to members of the Trump administration.\n\nShe said people who know Trump the best don't like him.\n\nTrump did not respond about Cheney; as for his former aides, he said: \"I fired most of those people.\"\n\n\u2212David Jackson\n\nHarris hits Trump's rallies\n\nKamala Harris set out to get under Donald Trump\u2019s skin. It appeared to work. Harris mocked Trump\u2019s references at his rallies to Hannibal Lector and his false claims that windmills cause cancer.\n\nThen she went in for the kill. \u201cAnd what you will also notice is that people start leaving his rallies early out of exhaustion and boredom,\u201d Harris said. Moderator David Muir sought to steer the conversation back to policy. Trump wasn\u2019t having it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to respond,\u201d Trump said. \u201cFirst let me respond, as to the rallies,\u201d he insisted. \u201cShe said people start leaving. People don\u2019t go to her rallies. There\u2019s no reason to go.\u201d\n\nHe claimed without evidence that Harris is busing in attendees of her rallies and paying them to be here.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t leave my rallies,\u201d he continued.\u201d We have the biggest rallies, the most incredible rallies in the history of politics.\u201d\n\n\u2212 Francesca Chambers\n\nHarris criticizes Trump for role in killing bipartisan immigration bill\n\nWhen asked why the Biden administration waited six months before the election to bring down border crossings at the U.S-Mexico border, Harris pointed the finger to Trump.\n\nHarris said Trump killed a bipartisan immigration bill that would have put 1,500 more border agents and resources to the border.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump got on the phone, called up some folks in Congress and said, \u2018kill the bill,\u2019\u201d Harris said. \u201cAnd you know why? Because he preferred a run on a problem instead of fixing a problem.\u201d\n\n\u2212 Rebecca Morin\n\nAre the mics muted? Not always\n\nIt doesn't sound like the other candidate's microphone is being muted, at least not all the time.\n\nBoth Trump and Harris could be heard arguing with each other on the abortion issue.\n\n\u2212 David Jackson\n\nTrump brags about overturning Roe v. Wade\n\nTrump\u2019s recent contortions on the abortion issue were addressed early in the debate, with the moderators asking about his position on Florida\u2019s abortion rights ballot measure.\n\nTrump came out against the constitutional amendment a day after indicating he might support it. In explaining his position Tuesday, Trump said \u201cthe reason I\u2019m doing that vote\u201d and then alleged that Democrats want extreme late-term abortion policies, including \u201cprobably after birth.\u201d The moderator interjected, noting no state allows a baby to be killed after birth.\n\nTrump bragged about overturning Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court decision guaranteeing a constitutional right to an abortion.\n\nRoe v. Wade was overturned \u201cthrough the genius and heart and strength of six Supreme Court justices,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI did a great service in doing it, it took courage to do it,\u201d Trump said.\n\n\u2212Zac Anderson\n\n'Insulting to the women of America'\n\nKamala Harris criticized Donald Trump for falsely claiming that there are states that allow people to give birth to children and then have an abortion, killing a child that has already been born.\n\nIt's \"insulting to the women of America,\" Harris said. She also said people do not have to abandon their \"faith and deeply held beliefs\" to support abortion access.\n\n\u2212 Marina Pitofsky\n\nTrump denies that tariffs would spike costs for Americans\n\nDonald Trump denied Tuesday that his proposed tariffs on foreign countries would hit average Americans\u2019 pocketbooks.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not going to have higher prices,\u201d Trump insisted, saying that it\u2019s China that would pay more.\n\nHe had pledged to slap a tariff of at least 10% on imported goods. He said in August that he could increase the across the board rate to as much as 20%. Trump says he\u2019ll put a 60% tariff on China, the United States\u2019 largest economic competitor.\n\nHarris has repeatedly said that Trump\u2019s plan is tantamount to a national sales tax on average Americans. At the debate, Trump said that if Harris \u201cdoesn\u2019t like them\u201d then she should have gotten rid of them, referring to the Biden administration\u2019s decision to keep Trump\u2019s previous tariffs on China in place.\n\n\u2212Francesca Chambers\n\nTrump jabs Harris, says he almost bought her a MAGA hat\n\nTrump on Harris accused Harris of picking up some of his economic proposals, flip-flopping on approaches to inflation and other debates. He joked that he almost bought her one of one of his signature red Make America Great Again hat.\n\nHarris visibly laughed as Trump targeted her economic positions.\n\n\u2212 Marina Pitofsky\n\nHarris quickly links Trump to Project 2025\n\nHarris used the economy question to link Trump to Project 2025, an uber-conservative government plan filled with economic and social ideas opposed by many voters.\n\nTrump said he knows nothing about Project 2025 - even though many of its authors are former Trump administration officials.\n\n\u2212 David Jackson\n\nHarris touts \u2018opportunity economy\u2019 plan, child tax credit\n\nKamala Harris kicked off the debate Tuesday on an issue that\u2019s top of mind for voters: the economy.\n\nHarris touted her plan that would address housing costs and give a $50,000 tax deduction to start up small businesses.\n\n\u201cI was raised as a middle class kid, and I am actually the only person on this stage who has a plan that is about lifting up the middle class and working people of America,\u201d she said. \u201cI believe in the ambition, the aspirations, the dreams of the American people, and that is why I imagine and have actually a plan to build what I call an opportunity economy.\u201d\n\n\u2212 Rebecca Morin\n\nHarris walks over to Trump, offers handshake\n\nVice President Kamala Harris walked over to former President Donald Trump and extended her hand as the only scheduled debate between the candidates began.\n\nHarris and Trump had never met before. He skipped her inauguration on his final morning at the White House.\n\nIn the election in which Trump has hurled personal insults at Harris, and Harris has characterized him as a threat to American democracy it was an unexpected and intentional sign of respect for the former president.\n\n\u2212Francesca Chambers\n\nAttending and 'spinning' for Vice President Kamala Harris\n\nSeveral prominent Democrats are expected to attend the debate and boast about their presidential candidate Kamala Harris. The Harris-Walz campaign announced a list of several Democratic governors, senators and representatives who will be in the \"spin room\" addressing the media.\n\nThose include:\n\nPresident Joe Biden and running mate Tim Walz are not in Philadelphia for the debate.\n\n\u2212 Kinsey Crowley\n\nVibe-check: Dems in Atlanta are excited to feel excited again\n\nMore than 30 minutes before the debate, Manuels Tavern \u2212 the Democratic-leaning bar where former President Jimmy Carter announced his 1970 gubernatorial campaign \u2212 is packed with a standing room only crowd.\n\nMost in the bar say they feel a huge difference between this debate and the one between Joe Biden and Donald Trump.\n\nBlake Bradburn, 33, watched the last one from home out of fear. This time? He wasn\u2019t going to miss the party.\n\n\u201cThe energy is back, that\u2019s what makes this fun.\u201d\n\n\u2212 Karissa Waddick\n\nHow to watch Trump, Harris debate\n\nABC News will host the debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump Tuesday. However, multiple channels, including NBC and CNN, will broadcast the event as well.\n\n\u2013 Savannah Kuchar\n\nJD Vance, RFK Jr. will be spinning for Donald Trump at the debate\n\nTrump running mate JD Vance is in Philadelphia, part of a large group of debate \"spinners\" who will promote the former president's cause with the media. The Trump spinner list also includes Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., the former independent candidate who dropped out and endorsed Trump.\n\nDaughter-in-law Lara Trump, a co-chair of the Republican National Committee, will also be spinning tonight.\n\nSo will at least ten more Republican governors and members of Congress.\n\n\u2013 David Jackson\n\nWhat is Project 2025?\n\nYou probably won't hear very much about policy documents during Tuesday's debate, but you're likely to hear about Project 2025.\n\nThe detailed plan to dismantle and reconstruct the government laid out by conservative groups known as the 2025 Presidential Transition Project has critics up in arms over its \"apocalyptic\" and \"authoritarian\" nature.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank in Washington, D.C., led an effort to create the more than 900-page \"Mandate for Leadership,\" published in April 2023, reimagining the executive branch and presented a plan to overhaul several federal government agencies, including the FBI, for the country's next conservative president to follow.\n\nMore:What is Project 2025? Is this Trump's plan? The Presidential Transition Project explained.\n\n\u2013 Rachel Barber and Marina Pitofsky\n\nTrump's supporters turn to debate\n\nTracey Naulty of Philadelphia\u2019s Port Richmond neighborhood watched pro-Palestinian protesters march east on Market Street.Carrying a sign supporting former President Donald Trump, Naulty said she believes \u201cwe won\u2019t have a country\u201d if he\u2019s not elected.\u201cThe economy was better and there were no wars\u201d when Trump was in office, she said. She called the protest \u201ca distraction from the real issues\u201d and believes Trump can bring peace to Ukraine and Gaza.Her dog, Nelley, a cocker-poodle mix, was wearing a pro-Trump outfit.\u201cShe\u2019s a Trumper, too,\u201d Naulty said.\n\n\u2013 Marina Pitofsky\n\nPro-Palestinian protests swell to hundreds of people\n\nRabiul Chowdhury, a demonstrator in Philadelphia on Thursday, said Abandon Harris was officially launching Tuesday \u2013an effort to force the Harris campaign to broker a cease-fire in Gaza or lose crucial votes in battleground states like Michigan and Pennsylvania.The Harris Campaign \u201cdoesn\u2019t care about us,\u201d said Chowdhury. The group is not advocating for Donald Trump, he added, and instead urging voters toward third party candidates like Jill Stein and Cornel West.Harris \"acts like we owe her our votes. \u201c he added. Asked if they worried about a Trump presidency, he said: \u201cWe can\u2019t blame Trump for what Biden and Harris did.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Phaedra Trethan\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz won't be present at debate\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz won't be in Philadelphia with his running mate, but will instead be campaigning in the Sun Belt on Tuesday night.\n\nThe VP nominee made his first solo visit to the crucial battleground state of Arizona Tuesday. He is set to speak at an event in Phoenix at 5:30 p.m. local time, just thirty minutes before Harris will take on Trump.\n\n\u2013 Sam Woodward\n\nInside Trump's and Harris' starkly different visions for the economy\n\nIf the economic visions of Joe Biden and Donald Trump were starkly divergent, the contrast between Trump and Kamala Harris is nearly blinding.\n\nTrump\u2019s and Harris\u2019 blueprints for the economy are expected to be spotlighted in their first and possibly only debate Tuesday evening, hosted by ABC News.\n\nWhat does Kamala Harris support? What about Donald Trump? Read more here.\n\n\u2013 Paul Davidson\n\nProtesters gather in Philadelphia, demonstrate over Israel-Hamas war\n\nA group of about 100 protesters gathered outside Philadelphia City Hall Tuesday evening to bring attention to the situation in Gaza, with plans to march as close to the Constitution Center as they can get, given the tight security perimeter there.\n\nHolding Palestinian flags and shouting pro-Palenstian chants, the group led by the Party for Socialism and Liberation wants people to know \u201cKamala Harris and Donald Trump have more in common with each other than they have with us,\u201d said Claudia Dela, a New York-based organizer.\n\n\u201cDemocracy is very much a sham,\u201d said Dela. Harris and Trump \u201care part of the same political class, and we need more voices of working people to demand what we deserve.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Phaedra Trethan\n\nBiden isn't attending debate, says Harris is \u2018going to do great\u2019\n\nPresident Joe Biden said he spoke with a \u201ccalm\u201d Vice President Kamala Harris hours ahead of the debate.\n\nSpeaking with reporters outside the White House, Biden said Harris seems \u201ccalm, cool and collected\u201d in his call with the vice president.\n\n\u201cI think she's going to do great. And I'm not going to tell you what advice I gave her,\u201d Biden said.\n\n\u2013 Rebecca Morin\n\n7 things to watch at the Kamala Harris-Donald Trump debate\n\nKamala Harris and Donald Trump's showdown in Philadelphia on Tuesday will be a major test \u2013 and opportunity \u2013 in a presidential campaign that has already been defined by a debate.\n\nDemocrats and their progressive allies are fully aware of the stakes after the last head-to-head showdown led to weeks of internal party turmoil culminating in 81-year-old President Joe Biden's dramatic exit from the race.\n\nMany are eager for Harris, known for her resume and reputation as a prosecutor, to take her Republican opponent to task over his unprecedented criminal record and to draw a contrast on critical issues facing the country in front of a national audience.\n\nRead more here\n\n\u2013 Phillip M. Bailey\n\nWhere do Harris and Trump stand in the polls?\n\nHarris seems to have national momentum on her side heading into the presidential debate, a USA TODAY/Suffolk Poll found. The poll of 1,000 likely voters taken after the Democratic National Convention showed Harris leading Trump 48%-43%. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.\n\nHowever, a New York Times/Sienna Poll of 1,695 likely voters taken last week found Trump leading Harris, 48%-47%, within the poll\u2019s three-percentage-point margin of error.\n\nThe race appears tighter in key swing states that could determine the election\u2019s outcome. Other polls show the candidates are neck and neck in crucial battlegrounds including Arizona, Pennsylvania, and Georgia.\n\n\u2013 Rachel Barber\n\nWelcome to Philly from the Harris campaign?\n\nElectronic signs at the intersection of 12th and Market streets in Philadelphia are flashing Philly-centric signs to Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cPhilly is Wit Harris\u201d\u2014a reference to how Philly natives take their cheesesteak (\u201cwit\u201d or \u201cwitout\u201d onions, to the rest of youse)\u2014and messages referencing crowd size and Project 2025 greet visitors, pedestrians and the media and dignitaries out to grab a bite at the nearby Reading Terminal Market and a Hard Rock Cafe.\n\n\u2013 Phaedra Trethan\n\nScaramucci: Harris appeals to \u2018normal Republicans\u2019\n\nAnthony Scaramucci, who served briefly as Donald Trump\u2019s White House communication\u2019s director, suggested Harris\u2019 economic agenda and national security ideas would appeal to \u201cnormal Republicans.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing radical about it,\u201d Scaramucci told reporters ahead of the debate.\n\nScaramucci, a Trump critic who is attending the debate as a Harris surrogate, said Harris\u2019 endorsement by former Vice President Dick Cheney and former Republican Rep. Liz Cheney \u201cgives space and comfort to normal Republicans, not Trumpish Republicans, but normal Republicans and independent moderates\u201d that she is the right choice in this election.\n\nScaramucci, who was fired from the Trump White House after less than two weeks on the job, introduced himself to reporters by joking, \u201cI'm Anthony Scaramucci, and I lasted one Scaramucci in the White House, which is 11 days.\"\n\n\u2013 Michael Collins\n\nDebate in Philly? Cue the theme from 'Rocky'\n\nBoth campaigns are referencing one of Philadelphia's claims to fame: The setting of the 1976 Oscar-winning boxing film \"Rocky,\" the story of scrappy underdog Rocky Balboa and his challenge to world champion Apollo Creed.\n\n\"Fight Night in Philly!\" tweeted Trump aide Steven Cheung as the Republican candidate's plane took off from South Florida. The Harris campaign, meanwhile, is planning a pre-debate \"drone show\" above the \"Rocky steps\" at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. The odds are good that the sound system will play the musical theme from the movie, \"Gonna Fly Now.\"\n\nA word of caution may be in order, however: In the first Rocky film, Balboa actually lost a split decision to Creed in the championship bout; it wasn't until the first sequel that Rocky became champion.\n\n\u2013 David Jackson\n\nHow to stream the debate, watch the debate without cable\n\nOn Tuesday, Sept. 10, at 9 p.m. EDT, USA TODAY Network will stream The ABC News Presidential Debate Simulcast on the USA TODAY channel, available on most smart televisions and devices.\n\n\u2013 USA TODAY Staff\n\nFormer Trump official Olivia Troye senses \u2018sea change\u2019 against ex-president\n\nOlivia Troye, who worked as a national security adviser to former Vice President Mike Pence, said she\u2019s hearing from other Republicans who believe Donald Trump is too extreme and don\u2019t want him to return to the White House.\n\nTroye, who quit her job in the administration after the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, is serving as a surrogate for Kamala Harris and is attending the debate as Harris\u2019 guest.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m seeing a sea change,\u201d Troye told reporters ahead of the debate. \u201cI\u2019m hearing from Republicans across the country. I\u2019m traveling to the swing states. I\u2019m talking to them directly, and they\u2019re saying, \u2018I don\u2019t identify with that.\u2019\u201d\n\nTroye said her values haven\u2019t changed and that she doesn\u2019t agree with everything Harris and her running mate, Tim Walz, support. But, \u201cI believe there is a better future for our country getting away from the extremism that Donald Trump and MAGA represent,\u201d she said.\n\n\u2013 Michael Collins\n\nMelania Trump raises questions about attempted assassination of her husband\n\nDonald Trump hasn't complained much about his security before the July 13 attempt on his life, but some of his allies have including former first lady Melania Trump. In a video promoting her upcoming memoir, Melania Trump called the assassination attempt \"a horrible, distressing experience,\" and said \"the silence around it feels heavy.\"\n\n\"I can't help but wonder, why didn't law enforcement officials arrest the shooter before the speech,\" the former first lady said.\n\nShe added: \"There is definitely more to this story, and we need to uncover the truth,\" she said.\n\nDonald Trump's son, Eric Trump, added on X: \"I want answers as well.

Kennedy Jr. in Glendale, Arizona, \"and if they were, they would not have granted it.\"\n\nThe representative added that \"any royalties received as a result of this use will be donated\" to Vice President Kamala Harris' presidential campaign.\n\n\u2013 Brendan Morrow\n\nTrump calls for government shutdown without voting legislation\n\nWhile preparing for the debate, Trump took time Tuesday to urge Republican lawmakers to shut down the government if Congress does not approve voting policies he wants. Trump wants to bar migrants who are in the country illegally from voting \u2013 but that is already illegal. His proposal would require new voters to submit more documentary proof of citizenship.\n\nStill, in a Truth Social post, Trump said Republicans in Congress should not approve a new spending plan without his voting plan. Congress' deadline to keep the government's doors open is Sept. 30.\n\n\"If Republicans in the House, and Senate, don\u2019t get absolute assurances on Election Security, THEY SHOULD, IN NO WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM, GO FORWARD WITH A CONTINUING RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET,\" he said.\n\n\u2013 David Jackson\n\nTwo former Trump officials, Anthony Scaramucci and Olivia Troye, will be guests of Harris campaign\n\nTwo former officials in Donald Trump\u2019s administration will be at the presidential debate for the Harris campaign on Thursday.\n\nAnthony Scaramucci, a former Trump White House communications director, and Olivia Troye, Homeland Security advisor to Vice President Mike Pence, will serve as surrogates for the campaign and warn what a second Trump presidency would look like.\n\n\u201cListen, don\u2019t take it from us: Take it from the ones who know Donald Trump the best and who are telling the American people exactly how unfit Trump is to serve as president,\u201d said Harris communications director Michael Tyler.\n\n\u2013 Rebecca Morin\n\nTrump will knock Harris on immigration at debate\n\nOne of the top issues Trump will hammer Harris on is immigration. Trump and his allies have labeled Harris as a \u201cborder czar,\u201d claiming that she was put in charge of the border and millions have crossed the border under her watch. Immigration experts previously debunked the claim, saying that Joe Biden tasked Harris with leading the administration's diplomatic efforts addressing the \"root causes\" of migration in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.\n\nTrump will likely compare his immigration record with that of the Biden-Harris administration\u2019s at the debate.\n\nAlong the U.S.-Mexico border, migrant apprehensions plunged in July from a year ago, to the lowest level of the Biden era, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection statistics provided to USA TODAY.\n\n\u2013 Sudiksha Kochi, Andre Byik and Lauren Villagran\n\nTrump: 'You don't know what to expect' ahead of debate\n\nExpect Donald Trump to harp on Kamala Harris' change of position on various issues \u2013 an allegation she's repeatedly rejected.\n\n\"You don't know what to expect - she's changed all of her policies over the years,\" Trump told NBC News in a phone interview on Tuesday. Harris and aides, meanwhile, plan to stress Trump's personal attacks on the vice president and other prominent Democrats.\n\n\u2013 David Jackson\n\nWhere do Trump and Harris stand on the wars in Israel, Ukraine?\n\nBoth Trump and Harris view Israel as a pivotal U.S. ally and have supported the country in the wake of Hamas\u2019 devastating attack on Oct. 7.\n\nStill, both nominees have split from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at times. Trump earlier this year earlier this year called on Israel to \u201cfinish up your war.\u201d Harris has said Israeli leaders \"must do more to protect civilian life\" in Gaza.\n\nTrump has said without evidence that, if elected, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine would be settled within 24 hours, though it\u2019s not clear how he would negotiate with the countries. Harris has widely criticized Russia\u2019s invasion. In a major shift, the Biden administration earlier this year authorized Ukraine to use U.S. weapons to strike targets inside Russia.\n\n\u2013 Marina Pitofsky\n\nBottoms up: Drinking games for tonight's debate\n\nTonight\u2019s debate is high stakes for both candidates, and millions of Americans are expected to tune in. For any viewers in need of entertainment with their politics, here are just a few drinking game ideas.\n\nSpicy USA TODAY presidential debate bingo: Players will follow along with bingo cards, and each person to subsequently call bingo takes their numerically assigned shot (of alcohol, if of age and appropriate).\n\nDebate foul, party foul: Essentially, if the candidates fail to follow the rules, viewers take a drink.\n\nLine by line, sip by sip: Players should pick their political cliche of choice (think \"my fellow Americans\" or \"We the People\") and sip every time that line is said.\n\nFor more game details and specifics, read here.\n\n\u2013 Savannah Kuchar and James Powel\n\nWhere do Harris and Trump stand on the border?\n\nTrump has made immigration and southern border policy a cornerstone of his political career. He has long attacked undocumented immigrants, promising wide-reaching deportations if he\u2019s elected to a second term. The Trump administration also faced major criticism over immigration officials separating children and parents or other family at the border with Mexico.\n\nHarris opposed the construction of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border as a 2020 presidential candidate, but she backed bipartisan border legislation pushed by the Biden administration that would have allocated unspent dollars to continue the construction of a border wall, among a host of other measures.\n\n\u2013 Marina Pitofsky and Joey Garrison\n\nWhen is the vice presidential debate? Will Tim Walz and JD Vance debate?\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Ohio Sen. JD Vance are gearing up to take the stage for a vice presidential debate after both accepted an Oct. 1 invitation from CBS News.\n\nThe outlet also offered the candidates the chance to debate on Sept. 17, Sept. 24, and Oct. 8, but neither accepted those invitations. Vance suggested they also debate Sept. 18, but Walz has not agreed to that date.\n\n\u2013 Rachel Barber\n\nHarris, Trump to meet \u2013 for the first time\n\nHarris and Trump have had much to say about one another while campaigning for president. But tonight\u2019s debate marks the first time that the pair will actually meet face-to-face.\n\nWhile both have been in politics and the public eye for decades now, the candidates have yet to cross paths.\n\nHarris was present as a senator for Trump\u2019s State of the Union addresses, but the two did not interact then. And Trump did not attend her vice presidential inauguration after refusing to accept the 2020 election results.\n\n\u2013 Savannah Kuchar and Phillip Bailey\n\nAdvocates urge prioritizing abortion discussion\n\nAbortion rights activists are calling for tonight\u2019s debate moderators to prioritize the issue in their questions to candidates.\n\nA petition by the progressive advocacy group MoveOn has garnered over 40,000 signatures, including support from actress Busy Philipps, and activists Amanda Zurwaski and Kaitlyn Joshua, who shared their personal abortion stories on stage at the Democratic National Convention last month.\n\nAbortion is likely to come up tonight as a top concern in this year\u2019s election. Harris, who has long been a leading voice in the Biden administration on the issue, has made reproductive rights a cornerstone of her presidential campaign.\n\n\u2013 Savannah Kuchar\n\nHow long is the debate tonight?\n\nPresidential debates are typically 90 minutes long, including the one tonight.\n\nThe Biden-Trump debate in June hosted by CNN went from 9 p.m. to about 10:30 p.m.\n\nIn 2020, the first presidential debate between Biden and Trump was also about 90 minutes. It was moderated by former Fox News journalist Chris Wallace.\n\n\u2013 Sudiksha Kochi\n\nHow old are the candidates?\n\nAge was at the center of discussion about the 2024 election after the June debate between Biden and Trump.\n\nBiden, 81, had a stumbling debate performance that night that ultimately led to him stepping aside and endorsing Harris to become the Democratic nominee.\n\nMembers of Congress, voters, and pundits wrung their hands publicly about it in the month after the debate while Trump sought to capitalize on Biden\u2019s poor performance. He mocked the president at a rally in Virginia the day after the debate and accused Biden of being a \"part-time president\" at a rally in Miami in July after Biden struggled to articulate his pitch to Americans on the debate stage.\n\nSo, how old is Trump, and how old is Harris?\n\nTrump turned 78 years old in June and would be 82 by the end of his term if he were to win in November.\n\nHarris will turn 60 in October and would be 64 years old by the end of her term if she were to win in November.\n\n\u2013 Elizabeth Beyer, David Jackson and Charles Trepany\n\nAre there more presidential debates?\n\nTonight\u2019s debate is currently the only face-off between Harris and Trump scheduled.\n\nTrump had proposed two other dates in September for additional debates, while the Harris campaign said in a statement the vice president would agree to another meeting between the candidates in October.\n\n\u2013 Savannah Kuchar and Marina Pitofsky\n\nHarris, Trump polling neck-and-neck in swing states\n\nHarris and Trump head into debate night Tuesday essentially neck-and-neck in the 2024 swing states.\n\nTrump had enjoyed a lead in these seven battlegrounds earlier this year when Biden was still in the race.\n\nShortly after taking over the ticket, though, Harris gained a slight advantage in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina and Arizona, and tied Trump in Georgia, according to a Cook Political Report survey last month. Trump continued to lead in Nevada by 5 points.\n\nAnd a Detroit Free Press survey late last month found Trump ahead again by one point in Michigan.\n\nEssentially, the race could not be tighter, and both candidates will be vying tonight for support from voters in these key states.\n\n\u2013 Savannah Kuchar, Joey Garrison, and Todd Spangler\n\nWhat are the debate rules and who are the moderators?\n\nThe debate will be 90 minutes long with two commercial breaks. There will be no props or pre-written notes allowed onstage, and candidates will be given a pen, pad of paper and a water bottle. Candidates' microphones will be live only for the candidate whose turn it is to speak and muted when the time belongs to another candidate.\n\nThe two moderators for the debate are ABC journalists Linsey Davis and David Muir. Muir is a broadcast journalist who is the host and managing editor of \"ABC World News Tonight with David Muir.\" Muir interviewed Biden earlier this year as a part of D-Day coverage and was Trump's first White House interview as president in 2017.\n\nDavis hosts \"ABC News Live Prime,\" ABC News' streaming evening newscast, and weekend \"World News Tonight\" on Sundays. She is also a correspondent for \"World News Tonight,\" \"Good Morning America,\" \"20/20\" and \"Nightline.\"\n\n\u2013 Saman Shafiq, Gabe Hauari, and Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWho won which states in 2020?\n\nIn the 2020 presidential race, Biden won 306 electoral votes to Trump\u2019s 232. Of the 538 votes in the Electoral College up for grabs, a candidate must receive 270 of those votes to win.\n\nIn 2020, Biden won six of the seven states deemed battlegrounds in this year\u2019s election: Arizona, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia and Nevada. Trump won one of this year's battleground states in 2020: North Carolina.\n\nBattleground, or swing states, are those that flipped parties in the presidential election between 2016 and 2020.\n\nAs Vice President Kamala Harris and Trump prepare to face off on the debate stage in Philadelphia later this evening, take a look at how the 2020 race shook out along with some background on the Electoral College.\n\n\u2013 Elizabeth Beyer\n\nWhere is the debate?\n\nThe debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris will take place in Philadelphia at the National Constitution Center.\n\nPennsylvania is one of a handful of battleground states that could be key in deciding the outcome of this year\u2019s presidential election.\n\n\u2013 Savannah Kuchar\n\nHow candidates are approaching the debate\n\nCatch up on the dynamics going into the debate tonight with these USA TODAY stories:\n\n\u2013 USA TODAY Staff\n\nWhat time will Trump and Harris debate?\n\nTuesday's debate is set to begin at 9 p.m. ET.\n\n\u2013 Savannah Kuchar",

        "text": "Experts react: What the presidential debate revealed about how Trump and Harris would conduct foreign policy\nWith the world riveted by the US presidential election, the debate pivoted on the world. On Tuesday evening, former President Donald Trump and current Vice President Kamala Harris faced off in Philadelphia ahead of the November 5 vote. From tariffs to energy and immigration, and from China to the Middle East, the two candidates often presented sharply contrasting visions on a range of foreign policy issues\u2014including consequential questions about the stakes for the United States in averting a Russian triumph in Ukraine and assuring a Ukrainian victory. Below, Atlantic Council experts offer insight on what we learned from the debate about each candidate\u2019s globe-spanning intentions.\n\nClick to jump to an expert analysis:\n\nJohn E. Herbst: On Ukraine, the debate underscored an unfortunate synergy between the two sides\n\nJosh Lipsky: Too little attention on China, too much attention on tariffs\n\nKimberly Donovan: Setting the record straight on US sanctions on Iran and its proxies\n\nPhilippe Dickinson: An answer on how to \u2018Trump-proof\u2019 NATO\n\nMatthew Kroenig: Voters looking for reassurance in a world of growing disorder were likely disappointed\n\nLandon Derentz: Trump and Harris both highlighted the direct link between jobs and energy\n\nJ\u04e7rn Fleck: Trump gives European leaders (except for Hungary\u2019s) cause for concern\n\nOn Ukraine, the debate underscored an unfortunate synergy between the two sides\n\nThe presidential candidates largely covered old ground in discussing Moscow\u2019s war on Ukraine. Trump reiterated that he would end the war as president-elect because he knows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin well and both respect him. He also repeated his claim that Putin never would have launched the full-scale invasion if he, Trump, were in office; Putin attacked, according to Trump, because the Biden administration was weak, as evidenced in its disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan. Trump also echoed the inaccurate theme often heard on the populist right that the United States has provided significantly more aid to Ukraine than its European allies have.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting moment on Russia and Ukraine came when the moderators asked if Trump thought a Ukrainian victory was in US interests\u2014twice. Trump\u2019s response was that an end to this bloody conflict, which has cost \u201cmillions of lives,\u201d was in the US interest.\n\nUnfortunately, the moderators did not ask Harris the same question. The Biden administration has famously (or infamously) avoided saying that its goal is a Ukrainian victory or a Kremlin defeat\u2014until this month. Harris was merely asked what her take was on the war. She used the occasion to define the danger of Moscow\u2019s aggression in much the same terms as US President Joe Biden has. The aggression against Ukraine was a blow to the rules-based international order, and a Kremlin victory there could lead to Russian aggression against the United States\u2019 NATO allies. She proudly defended the administration\u2019s role in rallying the international community to support Ukraine and prevent a Russian win.\n\nIt is also too bad that Harris was not asked if she would pursue a bolder policy than the administration\u2019s slow rolling of more advanced weapons to Ukraine and its reluctance to remove the restrictions on the use of all US weapons against military targets in Russia. This enabled her to appear tougher than Trump without touching on the vulnerability in the administration\u2019s handling of the war. The moderators could have done better.\n\nThe debate was a reminder of an unfortunate synergy between the approaches of Trump and Biden, and maybe Biden and Harris, on Moscow\u2019s war against Ukraine. Trump on several occasions raised the specter of nuclear war in criticizing Biden\u2019s weakness as bringing us closer to Armageddon. Trump apparently thought that a telling blow; but his argument ignores the growing realization that the Biden team has been intimidated by Putin\u2019s nuclear bluster from taking stronger steps to advance US interests by hastening Russia\u2019s defeat. And the thing is, Trump was demonstrating the same fear as the Biden team has.\n\nThe debate also featured some political theater (of the absurd) on the Russian war. When Harris was praising the administration\u2019s handling of the war, she mentioned that she met with Zelenskyy shortly before the big invasion. Sensing an opening, Trump pounced, stating that her \u201cmediation\u201d failed to prevent war. Of course, Harris was overstating her role, and Trump was punching at a phantom.\n\n\u2014John E. Herbst is the senior director of the Atlantic Council\u2019s Eurasia Center and a former US ambassador to Ukraine.\n\nToo little attention on China, too much attention on tariffs\n\nIf you made a word cloud for the debate last night, the term \u201ctariff\u201d would loom large. The candidates started with tariffs\u2014and a back and forth on the likelihood that new tariffs would cause inflation\u2014and came back to tariffs at the end. This debate wasn\u2019t happening in 1930, the year that the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act was passed; it was happening in 2024.\n\nIt tells you something about how far international economic policymaking has come over the past two administrations that the candidates both agree that tariffs were useful and instead disagreed on which sectors should be punished\u2014and which countries should be targeted. It\u2019s not about if; it\u2019s about how high. The economics of tariffs are clear: They are usually inflationary. That doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t a use case for them, either to protect critical sectors or to try to spur domestic manufacturing. But it does mean that if you want to introduce massive new tariffs, then it\u2019s incumbent to explain the rationale for them. That didn\u2019t happen last night. The last trade war showed us that China did not pay for the tariffs. Instead, companies who pay the import costs pass on those price hikes to consumers. The results are very likely to be the same in a new trade war.\n\nCountries around the world will hear the discussion between Trump and Harris and understand that this is a new era in the United States\u2014one in which both parties are rethinking the balance between national security and economics.\n\nThe reason that the balance is being recalibrated is, in large part, due to China. That\u2019s why it was striking that there was so little direct debate about China on Tuesday night. The world\u2019s second-largest economy, the country that presents the greatest political and economic challenge to the United States, the country that the State Department called out on the day of the debate for providing essentially unlimited support to Russia was more of an afterthought than a centerpiece. From artificial intelligence to chips, China was invoked, but largely in passing. But the next president will be grappling with China each and every day of their administration. We could have used a bigger presence in the word cloud for China, and perhaps a smaller one for tariffs.\n\n\u2014Josh Lipsky is the senior director of the Atlantic Council\u2019s GeoEconomics Center and a former adviser to the International Monetary Fund.\n\nSetting the record straight on US sanctions on Iran and its proxies\n\nWhen asked how he would negotiate with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Hamas over the ongoing Gaza conflict, Trump stated that the Biden administration \u201ctook off all the sanctions\u201d that Trump had placed on Iran, further saying that \u201cIran was broke under Donald Trump\u201d and \u201chad no money for Hamas or Hezbollah.\u201d This is not accurate.\n\nFollowing the United States\u2019 2018 departure from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the Trump administration reinstated the sanctions on Iran that had been lifted as part of the nuclear deal and implemented a \u201cmaximum economic pressure\u201d campaign targeting the Iranian regime and its partners and proxies in the region. Despite these crippling sanctions, Iran moved forward with its ambitions to develop weapons-grade enriched uranium, and it continued to provide hundreds of millions of dollars to support like-minded terrorist groups, while arming them with military know-how, equipment, and missiles that they would go on to use against Israel.\n\nThe sanctions levied against Iran during the Trump administration remain in place today. The Biden administration has not lifted or taken off any sanctions on Iran and, as has been previously noted in Atlantic Council research, the United States maintains more than 1,600 sanctions targeting the Iranian regime and Iran\u2019s partners and proxies, including Hamas and Hezbollah. Further, just this week, the US Treasury sanctioned more Iran-based individuals and entities that are facilitating Iran\u2019s military support and delivery of weapons to Russia.\n\nIn retrospect, more could have been done by both the United States and Israel to enforce sanctions and restrict Hamas\u2019s ability to raise funds, evade sanctions, and launder money leading up to the October 7, 2023, attacks. However, it is incorrect to say that sanctions targeting Iran, Hamas, or other Iranian partners and proxies were taken down at any point during the Biden administration, and it is misleading to say that Iran was broke under Trump.\n\nIf Harris and Trump debate again, I would be interested to hear their positions on how economic power is leveraged to advance US foreign policy objectives and protect national security interests. Specifically, it would be good to hear how they would weigh the costs, benefits, and risks of relying so heavily on tools such as sanctions and what that means for things like the price of gas for American consumers.\n\n\u2014Kimberly Donovan is the director of the Economic Statecraft Initiative within the Atlantic Council\u2019s GeoEconomics Center and a former senior official with the US Treasury Department\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.\n\nAn answer on how to \u2018Trump-proof\u2019 NATO\n\nA recurring question that animated conversation in the halls of this summer\u2019s NATO Summit in Washington was how to \u201cTrump-proof\u201d the Alliance. To the extent that the question needed a direct answer, Trump himself provided it on the debate stage in Philadelphia: Spend swiftly and substantially on defense, and give Trump the credit. The former president recounted a conversation he had with the outgoing NATO secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, in which he claims Stoltenberg credited Trump\u2019s brinkmanship with forcing the hands of otherwise reluctant Europeans to spend more on their defense budgets. \u201cHe said it was one of the most incredible jobs that he\u2019s ever seen done,\u201d Trump noted.\n\nOn the surface, this is a simple enough formula. But it invites follow-up questions that will be harder to answer. How much will be enough, particularly if Trump believes continually elevating demands on desperate Europeans will keep the euros flowing? And what of his proposed deal with Russia to end the war? Trump pointedly did not say that Ukraine winning was in the United States\u2019 interest, and he said that an early peace deal would be preferable. NATO allies on the eastern flank have witnessed Putin\u2019s aggressive, coercive tactics dating back to at least 2008, and they know that his appetite grows with the eating. How would NATO unity be sustained if asked to stomach a deal with Moscow?\n\nNo doubt the incoming NATO secretary general, former Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, watched and wondered less about how to \u201cTrump-proof\u201d the Alliance than the consequences of doing so.\n\n\u2014Philippe Dickinson is a deputy director with the Atlantic Council\u2019s Transatlantic Security Initiative, within the Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security. He previously served on the political team at the British Embassy in Washington, DC.\n\nVoters looking for reassurance in a world of growing disorder were likely disappointed\n\nForeign policy does not usually swing a large number of voters in elections, but with major wars in Europe and the Middle East, undecided voters in swing states may have been looking for reassurance in a world of growing global disorder. No news on foreign policy was made in last night\u2019s debate as both candidates repeated their prior positions.\n\nHarris said that she would support Ukraine and work toward a ceasefire in the Middle East. Trump repeated his claim that the conflicts would have never started if he were president, contrasting the current conflagrations with the relative stability that prevailed during his first term. When asked whether he wanted Ukraine to win, Trump repeated his long-standing position that his goal is to end the war, pledging that he could solve the conflict as soon as he is elected and before he enters the Oval Office.\n\nOn the global economy, Harris criticized Trump\u2019s promised tariffs, and Trump retorted that the Biden-Harris administration left the tariffs from his first term in place. They debated responsibility for the United States\u2019 humiliating retreat in Afghanistan, with Trump blaming Biden and Harris, while Harris accused Trump of negotiating the agreement to withdraw US forces in the first place.\n\nVoters tuning in in search of new or detailed foreign policy plans to help make their decisions were likely disappointed.\n\n\u2014Matthew Kroenig is the vice president and senior director of the Atlantic Council\u2019s Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security.\n\nTrump and Harris both highlighted the direct link between jobs and energy\n\n\u200b\u200bDulled by the steadfastness of US energy markets, attack lines on energy failed to resonate in last night\u2019s debate. With US oil and gas production at all-time highs and the price of gasoline hovering just over a manageable three dollars a gallon, Trump was forced to shift the overall narrative past the typical focus on consumer price sensitivity in favor of a broad juxtaposition between Republican and Democratic visions for the future of the US energy system.\n\nFor Trump, that means an emphasis on an abundance of US oil and gas. Harris, however, was prepared for this discussion, touting the Biden administration\u2019s extensive investment in fostering a clean energy economy and highlighting her determination to wield US energy policy as a tool for addressing climate change. And though the presidential hopefuls lacked congruence on the US energy mix, the genesis of each candidate\u2019s energy platform seems to emanate from a shared appreciation of the energy sector\u2019s potential to catalyze more American jobs.\n\nDebate clashes over energy policy quickly veered toward manufacturing and trade policy, including tariffs. While Trump and Harris may quibble over which party is responsible for stimulating more economic opportunity for the electorate, their shared focus on the American worker is a signal to be bullish on the sector regardless of who wins on Election Day. Energy, after all, is a backbone of US competitiveness.\n\n\u2014Landon Derentz is senior director and Morningstar chair for global energy security at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Global Energy Center.\n\nTrump gives European leaders (except for Hungary\u2019s) cause for concern\n\nLast night\u2019s debate provided another reminder for Europeans about what\u2019s at stake in the US elections and that they cannot avoid US politics. Policymakers across the Old Continent were provided a clear picture of the two competing visions for the United States\u2019 role in the world. Save one probably giddy Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, European leaders largely seem to prefer one vision over the other.\n\nThe night started with a reminder that Europe (and others around the globe) could potentially face the imposition of costly tariffs starting between 10 percent and 20 percent. This would upend the $1.3 trillion in transatlantic trade with the European Union (EU) and certainly invite a trade war, harming both the US and EU economies.\n\nTrump refused to say that Ukraine should win its war against Russia. He instead opted for his mealy-mouthed pledge to end the war on day one\u2014or even before\u2014without articulating a plan to do so. Harris meanwhile gave a full-throated defense of US support to Ukraine and perhaps the most explicit case she\u2019s made to the American people about why Ukraine matters to the transatlantic alliance.\n\nTrump also recited faulty figures about Europe\u2019s support to Ukraine, claiming the continent gives billions less than the United States. In reality, Europe has committed more to Ukraine than the United States has. European countries are spending more on defense and working on new ways to boost the continent\u2019s defense industry. There\u2019s no denying that the United States is the single largest country supporting Ukraine, and Europe should be doing more for Ukraine\u2019s sake and its own. But the reality of Europe\u2019s support to Ukraine flies in the face of ingrained political rhetoric that has been a stubbornly persistent\u2014and persistently wrong\u2014critique on this side of the Atlantic.\n\n\u2014J\u04e7rn Fleck is the senior director of the Atlantic Council\u2019s Europe Center.\n\nFurther reading\n\nRelated Experts: John E.

        "text": "A Joint Message About Upcoming U.S. Presidential Election Season\nWe are extremely excited about the start of the fall semester. This is a time of heightened expectations and possibilities for all members of our campus communities.\n\nFor some, these are the first new and exciting days of being a student, faculty, or staff member. For those returning, this time of year signals a renewal of a personal and professional commitment to the transformative value of the work of our two great universities.\n\nWe welcome all these experiences and wish to reaffirm our belief in the free, peaceful exchange of ideas that are at the heart of our institutional missions. We firmly believe that our universities \u2014 because of our people and their ability to show care, compassion, and understanding for one another \u2014 can provide a model of cooperation and collaboration during a time in our nation\u2019s history that is not without great challenges.\n\nThe start of the new academic year coincides with our country\u2019s presidential election season, as well as ongoing war and conflicts throughout the world. As part of our system of democracy, guests may visit our public campuses and express their views and opinions and try to engage our students or other members of our university communities.\n\nBoth of our universities need to be seen for what they are: places where constructive engagement is practiced; where reflection and civil discourse are valued; where there is a premium placed on dialogue that is not one-sided or threatening, but rather is rooted in mutual respect and understanding. Too often in our country today, there is no willingness to hear other perspectives and in the most extreme cases, protests turn violent. We do not want that to happen.\n\nIt is imperative that our students, faculty, and staff \u2013 as well as visitors \u2013 feel safe whenever they are on our campus. We fully support freedom of speech on our campuses; however, we need to be mindful that not all free speech is absolute. Any speech that threatens or directs hate toward any individuals or groups of people is contrary to our institutional values.\n\nWe have a busy semester ahead of us. We know that as we pursue the ideals of free and peaceful expression, there must be an ongoing effort by all of us to disseminate these values throughout our campuses. An environment where we are cognizant of our own beliefs as well as the beliefs of others makes us a stronger community. Be heard and listen to what others are trying to say.\n\nIf you have not already, we also encourage you to register to vote. The ability to vote for our elected officials in free and fair elections is a founding principle of our country\u2019s democracy and a standard bearer for other democracies.\n\nLet us have a productive and safe academic year.\n\nGo Rebels! Go Pack!\n\nKeith E. Whitfield\n\nPresident, University of Nevada, Las Vegas\n\nBrian Sandoval\n\nPresident, University of Nevada, Reno",

        "text": "Eating pets and \u2018Abdul\u2019: The US presidential debate\u2019s oddest moments\nWhat were the most bizarre moments of the Kamala Harris-Donald Trump presidential debate?\n\nAmid the heavier subjects pertaining to the economy, immigration and foreign policy that featured in the debate between United States presidential contenders Kamala Harris and Donald Trump on Tuesday night were some more bizarre moments and claims.\n\nTuesday night\u2019s 90-minute head-to-head \u2013 seen by many as a \u201cjob interview\u201d for the country\u2019s top job \u2013 could very well be the only debate between the two candidates before November\u2019s election.\n\nThe strange moments during a debate can tell us as much about the potential leaders as the serious issues. So what strange comments were made, and how did the political rivals handle them?\n\nTrump: \u2018Haitian migrants are eating pets in Ohio\u2019\n\nTrump made the claim that immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, were eating pets belonging to residents.\n\n\u201cIn Springfield, they\u2019re eating the dogs \u2013 the people that came in. They\u2019re eating the cats. They\u2019re eating \u2026 they\u2019re eating the pets of the people that live there,\u201d he thundered.\n\nTrump\u2019s running mate, JD Vance, made a similar claim on Monday, posting on his X account: \u201cMonths ago, I raised the issue of Haitian illegal immigrants draining social services and generally causing chaos all over Springfield, Ohio. Reports now show that people have had their pets abducted and eaten by people who shouldn\u2019t be in this country. Where is our border czar?\u201d\n\nThis rumour appears to have been started in a private Facebook group for Springfield residents in which a claim was made that a cat had gone missing, then was later discovered hanging from a tree at the residence of a Haitian neighbour. The rumour was reported in the Springfield News-Sun.\n\nTrump has long campaigned on the issue of reducing the numbers of undocumented immigrants and asylum seekers to the United States, but the claim that immigrants are eating pets in Springfield is unsubstantiated.\n\nAccording to a statement from the office of Springfield City Manager Bryan Heck: \u201cThere have been no credible reports or specific claims of pets being harmed, injured or abused by individuals within the immigrant community.\u201d\n\nTrump: \u2018Transgender operations on illegal aliens\u2019 in prison\n\n\u201cNow she [Harris] wants to do transgender operations on illegal aliens that are in prison. This is a radical left liberal that would do this,\u201d Trump asserted during the debate.\n\nThis claim relates to Kamala Harris\u2019s answer to a 2019 American Civil Liberties Union questionnaire supporting the use of taxpayer funds to provide gender-affirming care to transgender people.\n\nThe question, posed to candidates in the previous presidential election, was: \u201cAs President, will you use your executive authority to ensure that transgender and non-binary people who rely on the state for medical care \u2013 including those in prison and immigration detention \u2013 will have access to comprehensive treatment associated with gender transition, including all necessary surgical care? If yes, how will you do so?\u201d\n\nHarris answered \u201cYes\u201d and wrote: \u201cIt is important that transgender individuals who rely on the state for care receive the treatment they need, which includes access to treatment associated with gender transition.\u201d\n\nAlthough Harris\u2019s response was recently referred to in a report by CNN, the Harris campaign has not confirmed whether she still holds this position.\n\nTrump and the mystery of \u2018Abdul\u2019\n\nDuring a heated back and forth on the subject of the US withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021, Harris accused Trump of being irresponsible when he invited the Taliban to Camp David in 2019 when Trump was president. This meeting was later cancelled by the White House after a Taliban attack in September that year that killed 12 people, including a US service member.\n\nDuring the debate on Tuesday night, Trump then referred to \u201cAbdul\u201d in a rambling and confusing speech in which he said he had told the Taliban to stop killing US soldiers.\n\nHe said: \u201cAnd Abdul is the head of the Taliban. He is still the head of the Taliban. And I told Abdul, \u2018Don\u2019t do it any more. You do it any more, you\u2019re going to have problems.\u2019 And he said, \u2018Why do you send me a picture of my house?\u2019 I said, \u2018You\u2019re going to have to figure that out, Abdul.\u2019 And for 18 months, we had nobody killed.\u201d\n\nIt is likely that Trump was referring to Abdul Ghani Baradar, who during his peace talks with Trump in May 2020 was the Taliban\u2019s chief negotiator. Baradar, however, is not the supreme leader of the Taliban. He is currently a senior Taliban commander and Afghanistan\u2019s first deputy prime minister.\n\nTrump: Democrats emboldened assassination attempt\n\nTrump claimed that the assassination attempt on him during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13 when he was grazed on the ear was provoked by Democratic rhetoric.\n\n\u201cI probably took a bullet to the head because of the things that they say about me,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey talk about democracy. I\u2019m a threat to democracy.\u201d\n\nSeveral days before the Trump assassination attempt, the Florida Democratic Party issued a statement responding to a Trump campaign rally at Trump National Doral golf club in Miami, stating: \u201cAnd the vision that he did lay out, Project 2025, is an existential threat to our country. His threats against immigrants, women, the LGBTQ+ community, and more should terrify all of us \u2013 because if he wins, we know that he\u2019ll do everything possible to make sure he ends democracy as we know it. That\u2019s why we have to do everything possible to defeat Trump and re-elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris this November.\u201d\n\nDuring an event in September to honour the late Senator John McCain in Tempe, Arizona, President Joe Biden stated: \u201cTheir extreme agenda, if carried out, will fundamentally alter the institutions of American democracy as we know it.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cTrump says the constitution gave him \u2018the right to do whatever he wants as president\u2019. I\u2019ve never even heard a president say that in jest.\u201d\n\nDuring Tuesday night\u2019s debate, Harris also stated that Trump would \u201cterminate the Constitution of the United States\u201d.\n\nOn August 28, the FBI held a briefing to provide updates on the investigation into the Trump assassination attempt and gave details including possible motives of the suspect. Kevin Rojek, FBI special agent in charge of the Pittsburgh field office, said: \u201cWe continue to see through our analysis a mixture of ideologies. So I would say that we see no definitive ideology associated with our subject, either left-leaning or right-leaning. It\u2019s really been a mixture and something that we\u2019re still attempting to analyse and draw conclusions on.\u201d\n\nHarris: Trump claims \u2018windmills cause cancer\u2019\n\nPerhaps most bizarre of all, a question on abortion from ABC News Live anchor and debate moderator Linsey Davis led to Harris mocking Trump rallies and making a mention of Hannibal Lecter, a fictional serial killer in the movie Silence of the Lambs.\n\nHarris stated: \u201cYou will see during the course of his rallies, he talks about fictional characters like Hannibal Lecter. He will talk about windmills cause cancer. And what you will also notice is that people start leaving his rallies early out of exhaustion and boredom.\u201d\n\nThere has been no official reporting of how many people leave early during either Harris\u2019s or Trump\u2019s rallies.\n\nTrump decided to respond to this \u201coffending\u201d mention: \u201cFirst let me respond as to the rallies. She said people start leaving. People don\u2019t go to her rallies. There\u2019s no reason to go. And the people that do go, she\u2019s bussing them in and paying them to be there.\u201d\n\nTrump: \u2018Illegal immigrants\u2019 vote in presidential elections\n\nTrump repeated his allegation that the Democratic Party draws on undocumented immigrants as a voting bloc. In a November 2016 tweet on X, Trump said millions of people had voted illegally in the 2016 presidential election, suggesting that undocumented immigrants were among them.\n\nIn addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 27, 2016\n\n\u201cOur elections are bad. And a lot of these illegal immigrants coming in, they\u2019re trying to get them to vote. They can\u2019t even speak English. They don\u2019t even know what country they\u2019re in practically. And these people are trying to get them to vote,\u201d Trump stated during the debate.\n\nHarris responded indirectly to the claim: \u201cBut we cannot afford to have a president of the United States who attempts as he did in the past to upend the will of the voters in a free and fair election.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Bipartisan Policy Center, a US-based nonprofit organisation that works with policymakers, it is illegal for undocumented immigrants to vote in US elections.\n\n\u201cThe Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, explicitly prohibits non-citizens from voting in federal elections. It is not legal in any state for a non-citizen to cast a ballot in a federal election.\u201d",

        "text": "Foreign influence operations in the 2024 elections\nThe recent indictments of Russian individuals and sanctions against Russian entities show the risks facing America in the upcoming elections. Attorney General Merrick Garland unveiled nefarious foreign activities designed to sway the electorate and turn voters against one another. The Russian state media firm RT is accused of using AI and bots to spread propaganda videos with false narratives about crime, immigration, and the Ukraine war. Russians also have created fake sites designed to look like U.S. news organizations that promulgate misleading pro-Russian narratives.\n\nChina is also engaging in deceptive practices. On TikTok and X, a Chinese influence operation has posted videos purporting to be from U.S. voters complaining about reproductive rights, Israel, and homelessness. Some of the videos have been seen by as many as 1.5 million people before being taken down. They are part of an influence operation called \u201cSpamoflauge,\u201d designed to heighten American divisions and sow doubts about democratic political systems.\n\nIranian operatives already have hacked the emails of GOP political consultant Roger Stone. After getting access to his account, they contacted top Trump campaign officials in an effort to gain confidential information. Among the materials they supposedly acquired were the vetting files of Republican vice president nominee JD Vance and other documents.\n\nIt is for these reasons that recent polls show that 70% of Americans \u201care worried about how fake news might affect the upcoming election,\u201d and 58% already say they have been deceived by AI-generated news. More women than men indicate they have been tricked and half of young people claim they have been taken in by fake news.\n\nInfluence operations are not limited just to foreign entities but include domestic organizations and actors as well. In recent weeks, there has been a proliferation of fake pictures, videos, and narratives. For example, there are pictures of Kamala Harris in a bathing suit hugging convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, even though that never happened.\n\nThere have been numerous examples of Donald Trump being arrested by the police, dragged away by officers, and running from law enforcement, none of which actually happened. The goals of those circulating such images were to inflame Trump supporters, play to the narrative he was being mistreated, and amplify the idea that the system was rigged against him.\n\nTrump himself has circulated false materials showing Harris speaking before a communist rally with a large hammer and sickle insignia hanging above a large crowd. That image played to the nominee\u2019s complaint about \u201cComrade Kamala\u201d and allegations she was dangerously radical and far outside the political mainstream.\n\nThis narrative has also been pursued by businessman Elon Musk, who posted a fake image of Harris dressed in a communist-style military uniform. The caption on Musk\u2019s post, which was made on his social media platform X, reads, \u201cKamala vows to be a communist dictator on day one. Can you believe she wears that outfit!?\u201d\n\nThe circulation of fake images has not been limited to only depictions of the candidates. In a Truth Social post, Trump included a collection of images, many of which appear to be fake, that depict fans of Taylor Swift sporting \u201cSwifties for Trump\u201d shirts. Another fake image shows Swift dressed as Uncle Sam and includes text that reads, \u201cTaylor wants you to vote for Donald Trump.\u201d As the caption for his post, Trump wrote, \u201cI accept!\u201d implying that he accepted an endorsement from Taylor Swift.\n\nWe should not be surprised at the proliferation of so many fake images as this growing practice is documented in a new Brookings Press book, \u201cLies That Kill: A Citizen\u2019s Guide to Disinformation.\u201d Disinformation is a tough challenge because so many people have financial and political incentives to create and disseminate disinformation. Digital sites can make money through premium subscriptions, advertising, and merchandising sales. Tech tools make it easy to devise fake pictures and videos. The toxic political environment makes disinformation believable to many people who want to assign terrible motives to the opposition and accept the worst views about it. It\u2019s like a chicken and egg game; the toxic political environment makes people willing to believe disinformation and the disinformation helps perpetuate the toxic political environment.\n\nBeyond their own false narratives, fake images open an additional avenue for disinformation. With the proliferation of these images, politicians can falsely claim with perhaps greater apparent legitimacy that images painting them in a negative light (or their opponent in a positive light) are fake. This was seen when Trump falsely claimed that a picture of a large crowd at a Harris rally in Detroit was created using artificial intelligence, arguing that the sizable crowd \u201cdidn\u2019t exist.\u201d\n\nIn order to safeguard democracy, we need to take several actions to protect people from false narratives. We should demonetize disinformation so that making lots of money off of it is more difficult. That can happen by giving advertisers more transparency and control over their ad placements so their advertisements don\u2019t unwittingly finance known disinformation sites.\n\nSocial media platforms need to get more serious about content moderation. Most of the leading sites have terms of service agreements that preclude use of their platform to incite violence, promote hate speech, or engage in fraud. Companies that reduced their human safety staffs need to hire people whose jobs are to enforce the very standards firms claim to uphold.\n\nFinally, voters need to exercise common sense in evaluating information from partisan or foreign sources. If something seems far-fetched, it probably is, and people should act accordingly. Just as consumers have grown more skeptical about email phishing efforts, consumer fraud, or Nigerian residents offering \u201cquick rich\u201d schemes, voters need to consider the source of information and weed out the pictures, videos, and narratives that are too outlandish to be true. Only in those ways can people protect themselves and help the country safeguard its voting processes in the face of nefarious actions from foreign and domestic sources.",

        "text": "Fact-checking Kamala Harris and Donald Trump's 1st presidential debate\nVice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump met for the first time Tuesday in their first presidential debate of the 2024 election, hosted by ABC News.\n\nThe high-stakes, 90-minute debate was held at Philadelphia's National Constitution Center, with Trump and Harris arguing their case for the White House.\n\nAs the Democratic and Republican nominees debated the most pressing topics facing the nation, ABC News live fact-checked their statements for answers that were exaggerated, needed more context or were false.\n\nHARRIS CLAIM: 16 Nobel laureates say Trump's plan would increase inflation and land us in a recession\n\nFACT-CHECK: Mostly true\n\nHarris correctly describes what the Nobel laureates said about inflation during Trump's presidency: \"There is rightly a worry that Donald Trump will reignite this inflation.\" But while the group describes Harris' agenda as \"vastly superior\" to Trump's, their letter doesn't specifically predict a recession by the middle of 2025. Rather, the group wrote: \"We believe that a second Trump term would have a negative impact on the U.S.'s economic standing in the world and a destabilizing effect on the U.S.'s domestic economy.\"\n\nThe 16 economists are George Akerlof, Angus Deaton, Claudia Goldin, Oliver Hart, Eric S. Maskin, Daniel L. McFadden, Paul R. Milgrom, Roger B. Myerson, Edmund S. Phelps, Paul M. Romer, Alvin E. Roth, William F. Sharp, Robert J. Shiller, Christopher A. Sims, Joseph Stiglitz and Robert B. Wilson.\n\n-PolitiFact's Louis Jacobson\n\nRepublican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump speaks during a presidential debate with Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris, Sept. 10, 2024, in Philadelphia. Alex Brandon/AP\n\nHARRIS CLAIM: Trump wants a \"20% tax on everyday goods\" that would cost families \"about $4,000 more a year.\"\n\nFACT-CHECK: True, but needs context\n\nTrump has proposed a universal \"10-20%\" tariff on all U.S. imports, from cars and electronics to wine, food products and many other goods. He has also proposed a 60% tariff on imports from China. Vice President Harris called the plan \"Trump's sales tax,\" though the former president has not explicitly proposed such a tax. Independent economists, however, say the proposed import tariffs would unquestionably result in higher prices for American consumers across the board.\n\nThe precise financial impact on families is hard to predict and estimates vary widely -- from additional annual costs per household of $1,700 to nearly $4,000, depending on the study. Trump has not called for any tax hikes for American families.\n\nHe has proposed exempting Social Security benefits and tips from taxation, as well as extending individual tax cuts enacted in 2017.\n\n-ABC News' Devin Dwyer\n\nTRUMP CLAIM: Trump said, \"We have inflation like very few people have ever seen before. Probably the worst in our nation's history.\"\n\nFACT-CHECK: False, but it was very high\n\nIt's true that early in Joe Biden's presidency the annual inflation rate peaked at roughly 9% (June of 2022), but that's not the highest it's ever been. There are several examples of the inflation rate being much higher than 9% in the U.S, including in the immediate aftermath of World War II and during the oil embargo and shortages of the late '70s and early 1980s, when the inflation rate peaked at 14.5%.\n\nThe inflation rate as of July 2024 is at 2.9% annual inflation, the lowest it has been in three years. It should also be noted that President Biden has falsely claimed that he inherited a high rate from his predecessor. In fact, inflation was at 1.4% when he took office.\n\n*Data for this fact check was gathered from Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, or St. Louis Fed\n\nHARRIS CLAIM: Harris said, \"Trump left us the worst unemployment since the Great Depression.\"\n\nFACT-CHECK: Needs context\n\nThe unemployment rate peaked at 14.8% in April 2020 when Trump was in office \u2013 that was indeed the highest level since the Great Depression, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But unemployment rapidly declined to 6.4% in January 2021 by the time Trump left office, as the economy started to rebalance. And that 6.4% unemployment rate is still better than the 10% peak during the Great Recession in October 2009.\n\nIf you eliminate pandemic statistics, the lowest unemployment rate under Trump was just slightly higher than the lowest point under Biden. Both were good: 3.5% under Trump and 3.4% under Biden at their lowest respectively, according to data provided by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nHARRIS CLAIM: Trump \"killed\" bill that would have secured border\n\nFACT-CHECK: True\n\nEarlier this year, a bipartisan group of senators unveiled a $20 billion plan to substantially bolster security along the U.S.-Mexico border. It would have added hundreds of border patrol and ICE agents and asylum officers; funded construction of a new border wall; expanded detention facilities; ended \"catch and release;\" effectively closed the border entirely when illegal crossings surge; and raised the bar for asylum claims, according to the bill.\n\nThe influential Border Patrol union, which has previously endorsed Trump, publicly backed the bill. But hours after the draft legislation was unveiled on Feb. 5, Trump urged his party to oppose the bill, even as many Republicans have spent years lobbying for some of the security measures included in the deal.\n\n\"I'll fight it all the way,\" Trump told supporters at a Las Vegas rally on Feb. 8. \"A lot of the senators are trying to say, respectfully, they're blaming it on me. I say, that's okay. Please blame it on me.\" Trump openly invoked election-year politics as a motivation for his position: \"This Bill is a great gift to the Democrats, and a Death Wish for The Republican Party. It takes the HORRIBLE JOB the Democrats have done on Immigration and the Border, absolves them, and puts it all squarely on the shoulders of Republicans,\" Trump wrote on social media. The bill failed a key Senate procedural vote in May, with all but one Republican voting against it, including all those involved in crafting the deal.\n\n-ABC News' Devin Dwyer\n\nRepublican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump speaks during a presidential debate with Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris, Sept. 10, 2024, in Philadelphia. Michael Le Brecht II/ABC News\n\nTRUMP CLAIM: Haitian migrants eating pets in Ohio\n\nFact Check: False\n\nAccording to the city of Springfield, Ohio, these claims are false. A city spokesperson tells ABC News there have been \"no credible reports or specific claims of pets being harmed, injured or abused by individuals in the immigrant community.\"\n\nRumors that migrants from Haiti are stealing and eating animals there have run rampant after a series of claims spread widely online, amplified by social media posts from leading political figures in recent days.\n\n\"Additionally, there have been no verified instances of immigrants engaging in illegal activities such as squatting or littering in front of residents' homes. Furthermore, no reports have been made regarding members of the immigrant community deliberately disrupting traffic,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nThe House Judiciary GOP X account used AI tools to show Trump holding cats and ducks, portraying him as a savior of animals.\n\nOne of the main images circulating online, showing a man holding a dead goose, was taken not in Springfield but in Columbus, Ohio, two months ago. The resident who captured the image told ABC News he was surprised to see his image used to \" push false narratives.\"\n\nAccording to the Springfield News-Sun, the Springfield Police Department has not received any reports of pets being stolen and eaten. The city even created a webpage debunking some claims.\n\nMigrants have been drawn to the region because of low cost of living and work opportunities, the city says on its site. The city estimates there are around 12,000 to 15,000 immigrants living in the county, and that the rapid rise in population has strained housing, health care, and school resources. But the city also says that the migrants are in the country legally and that many are recipients of Temporary Protected Status from the federal government.\n\nHARRIS CLAIM: Trump 'intends on implementing' Project 2025\n\nFACT-CHECK: Needs context\n\nConservative allies and former advisers to Donald Trump published a 900-page policy blueprint in April 2023 to help a new Republican administration transition to power. The effort \u2013 dubbed Project 2025 \u2013 was organized by the Heritage Foundation, a prominent right-wing think tank. It details proposals for staffing the government and restructuring federal agencies, writing regulations, managing the economy and ensuring national security.\n\nHarris claims Trump \"intends on implementing\" the \"detailed and dangerous\" plan if he wins a second term. But Trump denies any association with Project 2025, saying on social media in July: \"I have not seen it, have no idea who is in charge of it,\" and also publicly denounced its substance as \"seriously extreme\" and developed by the \"severe right.\"\n\n\"I disagree with some of the things they're saying and some of the things they're saying are absolutely ridiculous and abysmal,\" Trump posted on social media. Many of the document's priorities, however, are broadly championed by Trump, including construction of a border wall, mass deportation of undocumented immigrants and banning transgender athletes from women's sports, among other things.\n\nDozens of former members of his administration were involved in the project, including former cabinet secretaries and West Wing aides. Many of the same people helped craft the Republican Party platform, ABC News has reported. Speaking at a Heritage Foundation event in April 2022, Trump said: \"This is a great group and they're going to lay the groundwork and detail plans for exactly what our movement will do... when the American people give us a colossal mandate to save America.\"\n\n-ABC News' Devin Dwyer\n\nVice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump attend a presidential debate in Philadelphia, Sept. 10, 2024. Michael Le Brecht II/ABC NEWS\n\nHARRIS CLAIM: Harris said, 'If Donald Trump were to be reelected, he will sign a national abortion ban.'\n\nFACT-CHECK: False\n\nTrump has said he has \"no regrets\" in selecting the Supreme Court justices who overturned the constitutional right to an abortion. But he also repeatedly has promised that if elected, he will not sign a federal abortion ban into law and will leave the issue up to the states. One open question this year had been whether he would enforce the Comstock Act, an 1873 law that prohibits mailing materials used in abortions.\n\nAmong other things, the law would make it illegal to ship the drug mifepristone, which is used to terminate early pregnancies. The Biden administration has said the law is unenforceable because the drug has medical uses other than abortion, and it would be impossible to know how the drug was being used. Trump's running mate, JD Vance, and other conservatives have called for the enforcement of the law.\n\nIn an August interview with CBS News, Trump said that while \"we will be discussing specifics of it,\" he will not enforce the Comstock Act.\n\nTRUMP CLAIM: Trump said, 'They didn't fire anybody having to do with Afghanistan.'\n\nFACT-CHECK: True, but needs context.\n\nIt is accurate that no one with a direct role in the chaotic withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan in 2021 has been held publicly accountable.\n\nTrump appears to be specifically referring to a suicide bombing that killed 13 U.S. service members. U.S. Central Command ultimately concluded that the bombing was not preventable and that members of a Marine sniper team were mistaken when they told others they had the suicide bomber in their sights.\n\nTrump, congressional Republicans and several Gold Star families say they believe these investigations have not gone far enough.\n\nTRUMP CLAIM: Kamala Harris wants to ban fracking\n\nFACT-CHECK: Needs context\n\nIt's true that Harris once called to ban fracking altogether, but she has since said she changed her policy view. During a CNN town hall on climate change in 2019 when she was still a Senator, Harris said, \"There's no question I'm in favor of banning fracking.\" Fracking is short for \"hydraulic fracturing,\" and it's a technique used in the extraction of oil and natural gas from underground rock formations.\n\nHarris also said she backed California's efforts to stop the practice in her home state when she was the state's attorney general. However, she eventually changed her view on fracking when she became Biden's running mate in 2020. During an October 2020 segment on ABC's The View, Harris said neither she nor Biden would ban fracking. Harris reiterated that she would not ban fracking during the ABC News Presidential Debate.\n\nTRUMP CLAIM: Trump said, 'I'd like to give you 10,000 National Guard soldiers. They rejected me. Nancy [Pelosi] rejected me.'\n\nFACT-CHECK: False\n\nThe final report by the bipartisan Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol determined there was \"no evidence\" to support the claim that Trump gave an order \"to have 10,000 troops ready for January 6th.\"\n\nThe report quoted President Trump's Acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller, who directly refuted this claim under oath, saying, \"There was no direct order from the President\" to put 10,000 troops to be on the ready for Jan. 6.\n\nInstead, the report noted that when Trump referenced that number of troops, it was not to protect the Capitol but that he had \"floated the idea of having 10,000 National Guardsmen deployed to protect him and his supporters from any supposed threats by left-wing counter-protesters.\"\n\nDemocratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris gestures as she speaks during an ABC News presidential debate with Republican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump, Sept. 10, 2024, in Philadelphia. Alex Brandon/AP\n\nHARRIS CLAIM: If elected, Trump would be immune from criminal prosecution\n\nFACT-CHECK: Partly true\n\nVice President Harris claimed Trump would be \"immune from any misconduct\" and have \"no guard rails\" after a landmark Supreme Court decision in June.\n\nThe court did rule that presidents and former presidents \u201cmay not be prosecuted for exercising his core constitutional powers.\u201d (Article II of the Constitution lists the core powers, which include the ability to make treaties, veto bills, nominate cabinet members, appoint ambassadors, act as Commander-in-Chief of the military, and grant pardons.) The court also said that presidents enjoy \"at least presumptive immunity\" for other \"official acts\" \u2013 defined broadly as actions within the \"outer perimeter\" of official responsibilities but not \"manifestly or palpably beyond his authority.\"\n\nWhile the decision is widely construed as granting broad protection for a president, the court said presidents are \"not above the law\" and enjoy no \"absolute\" immunity, leaving room for a narrow set of cases where a current or former president could face criminal prosecution. There is also no immunity for \"unofficial\" acts, the court said.\n\nTrump faces a pair of active federal criminal cases against him brought by Special Counsel Jack Smith. The Supreme Court decision does not mean those prosecutions cannot move forward, but it has significantly delayed proceedings and made it more difficult to convict Trump. If he were to win a second term, Trump's Justice Department could dismiss the Special Counsel and effectively end the cases against him.\n\n-ABC News' Devin Dwyer\n\nTRUMP CLAIM: Trump said he ended the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, and 'Biden put it back on day one.'\n\nFACT-CHECK: Mostly false\n\nThe Nord Stream 2 is an undersea pipeline that would have allowed Russia to increase natural gas exports to Western Europe while bypassing Ukraine and depriving Kyiv billions of dollars in access fees. It's true that in 2019, Trump announced sanctions that halted the pipeline's construction. But by that point, the pipeline was nearly complete with a majority of the project occurring under Trump's presidency, according to a 2020 analysis by the Congressional Research Service.\n\nBiden later waived sanctions against the pipeline's builder at the request of Germany in 2021, but reimposed penalties the following year as Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\nHARRIS CLAIM: Trump's deal with the Taliban is to blame for the chaotic withdrawal in Afghanistan.\n\nFACT-CHECK: Needs context\n\nThe top government watchdog on the Afghanistan war blames Trump's 2020 deal with the Taliban as \"the single most important factor\" in the rapid collapse of Afghanistan's forces a year later. But the same office also says Biden's decision to stick with a firm withdrawal date of U.S. troops was a factor as well.\n\nTrump's deal with the Taliban called for the withdrawal of U.S. forces by May 2021 and release 5,000 of its fighters from Afghan prisons so long as they agreed not to attack U.S. forces. According to the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, the agreement was seen by Afghan forces as a \"signal that the U.S. was handing over Afghanistan to the enemy as it rushed to exit the country.\" Trump also had reduced U.S. troop levels to the lowest point in the 20-year war, and Afghan forces weren't prepared to take over, according to the inspector general.\n\nBiden aides say the poor security situation when he took office in January 2021 put the newly elected president in an almost impossible position. Biden could have surged U.S. troops to the country to try to bolster the weakened Afghan government. But doing so would have extended what was already the nation's longest war and put American forces at risk of renewed attacks by the Taliban. According to the inspector general, Biden's announcement that he would stick with a 2021 withdrawal date contributed to the poor morale among Afghan troops, paving the way for a government collapse and subsequent Taliban takeover.\n\nTRUMP CLAIM: Harris and Walz support abortion 'in the seventh month, the eighth month, the ninth month\u2026 And probably after birth.'\n\nFACT-CHECK: False\n\nTrump has claimed that Democrats in some states allow for the killing of an infant after birth. This is false.\n\nThere is no state that allows the killing of a baby after birth. Infanticide is illegal in all 50 states. His false claim stems from a refusal by many Democrats to support any legal restrictions on abortion, and he specifically references comments by former Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, a physician, who once said that in rare, late-pregnancy cases when fetuses are nonviable, doctors deliver the baby, resuscitate it if the mother wishes, and then have a \"discussion\" with the mother.\n\nWhile most states that allow abortion do so only up until fetal viability, there are several states \u2013 including Colorado, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Vermont and Gov. Tim Walz's home state of Minnesota \u2014 that do not impose a legal limit on abortion procedures. Advocates for abortion rights say the absence of legal consequences after fetal liability doesn't mean doctors will try to terminate full-term, healthy pregnancies.\n\nIn fact, access to late-term procedures is limited, costly and medically complex -- typically done only when a woman's life is threatened or the fetus isn't expected to survive. Many Democrats say they want to pass legislation that would codify the 1973 Supreme Court decision Roe v. Wade, which protects abortion rights up until viability.\n\nTRUMP CLAIM: Trump said he lost the 2020 election on a 'technicality' because judges determined he lacked standing in election lawsuits.\n\nFACT-CHECK: False\n\nTrump lost the 2020 election after Biden won 306 electoral votes, compared to Trump's 232 electoral votes.\n\nAfter losing the 2020 election, Trump and his allies filed more than 60 lawsuits to challenge the outcome of the election -- the overwhelming majority of which were dismissed or dropped. Many of the cases were dismissed because the plaintiffs in the cases could not prove a strong enough connection to the action they were challenging. Not having \"standing\" is a common and legally justifiable reason for a case to be dismissed.\n\nFormer President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump listens during an ABC News presidential debate with Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris in Philadelphia, on Sept. 10, 2024. Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\n\nTRUMP CLAIM: The Biden administration left $85 billion worth of 'brand new beautiful military equipment behind' in Afghanistan that was seized by the Taliban.\n\nFACT-CHECK: False\n\nThis is not accurate, as $83 billion is an estimate of the entire amount spent by the US in security assistance in Afghanistan since 2001.\n\nStill, the Defense Department's Inspector General estimates $7.12 billion worth of U.S.-funded equipment was seized by the Taliban when the U.S. withdrew. According to the government watchdog, that amount includes 78 aircraft, some 9,500 air-to-ground munitions, 40,000 vehicles, 300,000 weapons and nearly all night-vision, surveillance, communications and biometric equipment provided to Afghanistan forces.\n\nHARRIS CLAIM: Harris said of the Central Park 5, 'Trump took out a full-page ad calling for their execution'\n\nFACT-CHECK: True\n\nNot long after the Central Park Five were arrested, Trump placed full-page ads in New York newspapers urging New York to bring back the death penalty. \"These muggers and murderers\" should be \"forced to suffer and, when they kill, they should be executed for their crimes,\" said the ad, above Trump's signature.\n\n-PolitiFact's Aaron Sharockman\n\nHARRIS CLAIM: Trump exchanged love letters with Kim Jong Un\n\nFACT-CHECK: False\n\nTrump did exchange letters with Kim Jong Un in August 2018 after the two leaders held a summit together in Singapore in June 2018. Trump tweeted thanking the North Korean leader \"for your nice letter \u2013 I look forward to seeing you soon.\" The White House at the time said Trump sent a reply to the North Korean leader, but the White House did not provide details about what was in Kim Jong Un's letter or what was in Trump's reply.\n\nIn August 2019, Trump said he received a \"very beautiful letter\" from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un when speaking to reporters.\n\nIn September 2018, Trump told a crowd at a campaign rally that there was once tough talk between the two leaders, \"and then we fell in love.\"\n\n\"And then we fell in love, okay? No, really - he wrote me beautiful letters, and they're great letters,\" Trump said at the rally. Trump did often speak favorably of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during and after his presidency.\n\nRepublican presidential nominee, former President Donald Trump, debates Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, for the first time during the presidential election campaign on Sept. 10, 2024 in Philadelphia. Win Mcnamee/Getty Images\n\nHARRIS CLAIM: Biden-Harris made historic investments in clean energy\n\nFACT-CHECK: Needs context\n\nThe U.S. budget for clean energy investments (over $559 billion as of August 2023) is the largest in the world, according to the World Economic Forum. About a third of that investment is going toward low-carbon electricity projects, and about a quarter is aimed at developing low-carbon, efficient transportation, according to WEF. In the first quarter of 2024, the U.S. \"continued its record-setting growth\" with a new high of $71 billion invested in clean energy and transportation, according to Clean Investment Monitor.\n\nAt the same time, the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported in March that the U.S. is now producing more crude oil than any country ever has -- and has been for the past six years in a row. In December 2023 the U.S. reached a new monthly record high of more than 13.3 million barrels per day, according to the EIA.\n\nThe Harris-Walz campaign told ABC News that the trillion-dollar amount cited by the vice president is based on the total spending of the Inflation Reduction Act, the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. In a statement, they told us \"Vice President Harris was proud to cast the tie-breaking vote on the largest ever investment to address the climate crisis and under the Biden-Harris Administration, America is more energy secure than ever before with the highest domestic energy production on record.\"\n\nEven if you take the lowest estimate for federal spending under the IRA, 780-800 billion dollars, adding the funds allocated in the CHIPS and BIL laws does exceed the $1 trillion figures that Harris has cited in her campaign speeches. All three laws include provisions that address climate change.\n\nTRUMP CLAIM: Trump suggested he 'probably took a bullet to the head' because of Harris.\n\nFACT-CHECK: False\n\nTrump suggested that the July 13 assassination attempt may have been because of Harris. The FBI has not established a motive that explains why Thomas Matthew Crooks fired on Trump. Trump said, \"This is the one that weaponized, not me. She weaponized. I probably took a bullet to the head because of the things that they say about me. They talk about democracy, I'm a threat to democracy. They're the threat to democracy.\"\n\nDuring the most recent update on the investigation in a briefing with reporters on Aug. 28, FBI Executive Director Robert Wells said, \"At this time, the FBI has not identified a motive nor any co-conspirators or associates of Crooks with advanced knowledge of the attack.\" \"We continue to see through our analysis a mixture of ideologies. So I would say that we see no definitive ideology associated with our subject, either left-leaning or right-leaning. It's really been a mixture and something that we're still attempting to analyze and draw conclusions on,\" FBI Special Agent in Charge of the Pittsburgh Field Office Kevin Rojek said at the same briefing.\n\nWhile they do not know what motivated crooks, the FBI does believe he had a mindset to carry out some kind of attack and looked at Trump's Butler rally, about an hour from his home, as a \"target of opportunity.\"\n\n\"Regarding the subject's mindset, so we saw, through our analysis of all his - particularly his online searches - a sustained detailed effort to plan an attack on some events, meaning he looked at any number of events or targets. And then when this event was announced, the Trump rally was announced early in July, he became hyper-focused on that specific event and looked at it as a target of opportunity,\" Rojek said. \"Again, I want to stress that we continue to analyze all the evidence associated with his accounts, with his online search activity. And we have a clear idea of mindset, but we are not ready to make any conclusive statements regarding motive at this time.\"\n\nTRUMP CLAIM: Trump said 'Ashley Babbitt was shot by an out-of-control police officer that should have never, ever shot her. It's a disgrace.'\n\nFACT-CHECK: Misleading\n\nThe U.S. Capitol Police Office of Professional Responsibility in August 2021 cleared the officer involved in the shooting of Ashli Babbitt, saying that officer would \"not be facing internal discipline.\"\n\nAn internal investigation found the actions of the officer were \"lawful and within Department policy,\" it said.\n\nBabbitt was seen on video on Jan. 6 attempting to kick through a window near the House Speaker's Lobby, shortly after Babbitt entered the Capitol. She was subsequently shot and killed by the officer.\n\nThe agency said they'd reviewed all available evidence in connection with the shooting including video and radio calls, and Capitol Police stood by the officer and said his actions saved the lives of lawmakers and family members.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris participate in a presidential debate in Philadelphia, Sept. 10, 2024. Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\n\nHARRIS CLAIM: Harris said, 'As of today, there is not one member of the United States military who is an active duty in a combat zone, in any war zone around the world, the first time this century.'\n\nFACT-CHECK: False\n\nHarris appears to be using a narrow definition of what constitutes a combat zone, because there are U.S. military troops in the Middle East who have come under deadly fire over the last year.\n\nThere are currently 2,500 U.S. military troops in Iraq and more than 900 U.S. military personnel in Syria who are on a mission to support local forces to prevent a resurgence by ISIS. While the troops in both countries are mostly involved in an advisory role some of them are also engaged in risky counterterrorism missions against ISIS. But the real threat to these troops over the past year were the repeated attacks against U.S. bases in both countries by Iranian-backed militia groups that launched more than 170 rocket and drone attacks.\n\nBut it was an attack on a U.S. base in neighboring Jordan this past January that has proven to be the most costly. Three U.S. Soldiers were killed and 34 others were wounded when a drone launched by those militia groups made it past air defense systems. That attack led the Biden administration to order large-scale retaliatory airstrikes against the Iranian-backed militia groups.\n\nTRUMP CLAIM: Trump said, 'Iran was broke under Donald Trump. Now Iran has $300 billion because they took off all the sanctions that I had.'\n\nFACT-CHECK: Mostly false, needs context\n\nTrump claimed that if he was in office, Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel never would have happened because the terror group's chief sponsor, Iran, \"had no money for terror.\" However, Iran has been Hamas' principal backer for decades, including through the Trump presidency. Records retrieved from inside Gaza by the Israeli Defense Forces and verified by independent news outlets indicate Tehran funneled tens of millions of dollars during the Trump administration.\n\nTwo of Trump's top advisers for Middle Eastern affairs also claimed that Iran was supplying Hamas and other Palestinian terror groups with $100 million each year in an op-ed published in 2019. Trump also said that Iran gained $300 billion because the Biden-Harris administration \"took off all the sanctions I had\" on Iran.\n\nThe current administration has maintained and even levied new sanctions against Iran, but during its attempt to renegotiate an Obama-era nuclear deal that Trump exited in 2018, the U.S. did ease the enforcement of some sanctions and restore a U.N waiver that allowed companies from other countries to conduct non-proliferation work at Iranian nuclear sites.\n\nAccording to shipping data, Iran's oil exports\u2014its chief source of revenue\u2014have climbed during the last four years. But experts estimate than Tehran has been able to accrue around $100 billion at most during President Biden's term, which is substantially less than Trump's figure of $300 billion.\n\nHARRIS CLAIM: Harris said, 'The former president said climate change is a hoax'\n\nFACT-CHECK: True\n\nTrump certainly has a lengthy record of using the word \"hoax\" to describe climate change \u2014 mostly before and during his first run for president.\n\nOn Dec. 30, 2015, Trump told the crowd at a rally in Hilton Head, South Carolina, \"Obama's talking about all of this with the global warming and... a lot of it's a hoax. It's a hoax. I mean, it's a money-making industry, okay? It's a hoax, a lot of it.\" On Jan. 25, 2014, Trump tweeted, \"NBC News just called it the great freeze \u2014 coldest weather in years. Is our country still spending money on the GLOBAL WARMING HOAX?\"\n\nOn Jan. 29, 2014, Trump tweeted: \"Snowing in Texas and Louisiana, record setting freezing temperatures throughout the country and beyond. Global warming is an expensive hoax!\" That same day, he tweeted, \"Give me clean, beautiful and healthy air - not the same old climate change (global warming) b-------! I am tired of hearing this nonsense.\"\n\nTrump also called climate change a \"hoax\" on the Jan. 6, 2014, edition of Fox & Friends. In addition, he said on the Sept. 24, 2015, edition of CNN's New Day, \"I don't believe in climate change.\" And on Jan. 18, 2016, Trump said that climate change \"is done for the benefit of China, because China does not do anything to help climate change.\"\n\n-PolitiFact's Aaron Sharockman\n\nTRUMP CLAIM: Trump claims Europe giving billions less to Ukraine than the U.S.\n\nFACT-CHECK: False\n\nTrump said the U.S. has committed \u201c250 billion or more\u201d in aid to Ukraine, claiming that European countries meanwhile have paid $150 billion less, despite being more directly affected by the war.\n\n\u201cYou take a look at what's happening, we're in for 250 to 275 billion. They're into 100 to 150,\u201d Trump said.\n\nIn reality, while the U.S. is easily the largest single donor to Ukraine, European countries collectively have given significantly more and their share recently has increased.\n\nAccording to Kiel Institute\u2019s Ukraine aid tracker, the U.S. has so far committed nearly $109 billion to Ukraine in military and humanitarian aid, with roughly $25.7 billion still to be allocated.\n\nEuropean countries have committed more than $196 billion -- that is $87 billion more than the U.S., according to the Kiel Institute tracker. However, $85 billion of that also remains to be allocated.\n\nMedia reporting often says the U.S. has committed $175 billion to Ukraine through Congressional approvals. But in reality, much of those funds are not destined for Ukraine, but instead goes to the Department of Defense for procurement, operations and maintenance, as well as other programs, according to the Kiel Institute.\n\nThe U.S. remains the crucial supporter of Ukraine and is irreplaceable in terms of military equipment and ammunition, which other NATO allies lack in sufficient amounts. When hard-right pro-Trump Republicans in Congress delayed a new aid bill for months, Ukraine began to suffer severe ammunition shortages.",

        "text": "The presidential debate proved that climate change is not at center of 2024 election, experts say\nClimate change is no longer a standalone issue in politics, experts said.\n\nThe presidential debate proved that climate change is not at center of 2024 election, experts say\n\nClimate change remains on the backburner of the 2024 election following little mention of environmental policy during the first -- and possibly only -- debate between the two presidential candidates.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump faced off for the first time on Tuesday night from the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, where neither candidate dedicated ample time to addressing what they would do to reduce the nation's greenhouse gas emissions and bolster the clean energy industry.\n\n\"I think what we learned last night is that climate really is not on the ballot this fall,\" Leah Aronowsky, a science historian at the Columbia Climate School, whose research has focused on the history of climate science and climate denialism, told ABC News.\n\nClimate change has not taken center stage this election cycle due to other topics -- such as the economy, immigration and abortion -- but that doesn't mean that reducing greenhouse gas emissions is any less important, John Abraham, a professor of mechanical engineering at the University of St. Thomas in Minnesota, told ABC News.\n\nThe first mention of greenhouse gas emissions came amid Trump's claims that he \"built one of the strongest economies in the history of the world.\" The former president accused the Biden administration of enacting policies that would destroy the domestic oil industry and cause inflation to worsen.\n\nBut, the Biden administration produced 12.9 million barrels per day in 2023, breaking the record set in 2019 at 12.3 million barrels, data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration shows.\n\nClimate activists and migrants lead a climate protest march, Aug. 16, 2024, in New York. Yuki Iwamura/AFP via Getty Images\n\nDuring the debate, Harris touted the Biden administration bringing domestic gas production to \"historic levels.\" Lena Moffitt, executive director of the environmental organization Evergreen Action, an environmental nonprofit, told ABC News the reference was likely an effort to entice a broad array of voters by promising to extend commitment to fossil fuel extraction while also building out a renewable energy industry and focusing more on electric vehicles.\n\nHarris was also questioned during the debate on whether she has changed her \"values\" on whether to ban fracking.\n\nReliance on domestic stores of oil necessitates continued fracking, Harris said, making clear that she will not ban the technique used to extract oil and gas from underground rock formations, despite Trump's insistence that she had been against it for \"12 years.\"\n\nABC News could not identify why Trump claimed Harris had been claiming for 12 years that she would ban fracking.\n\nIn 2016, while attorney general of California, Harris sued the U.S. Interior Department over its environmental assessment on the California coastline, which would have allowed fracking on the Pacific Outer Continental Shelf. Since 2020, Harris has made it \"very clear\" that she will not ban fracking, she said during the debate.\n\n\"I was the tie-breaking vote on the Inflation Reduction Act, which opened new leases on fracking,\" she said. \"My position is that we have got to invest in diverse sources of energy so we reduce our reliance on foreign oil.\"\n\nA soybean field lies in front of a natural gas drilling rig, Sept. 8, 2012, in Fairfield Township, Pennsylvania. Robert Nickelsberg/Getty Images\n\nThe only question explicitly about climate change came at the very end, just before the candidates' closing arguments.\n\nWhen asked what she would do to fight climate change, Harris first reminded voters that Trump has described the climate crisis as a \"hoax\" before talking about where Americans are being hit hardest by extreme weather events: their homes.\n\nHomeowners in states that experience extreme weather events are increasingly being denied home insurance, or premiums are \"being jacked up,\" Harris said.\n\n\"You ask anybody who has been the victim of what that means -- in terms of losing their home, having nowhere to go,\" Harris said.\n\nAppealing to homeowners was a smart move on Harris' part, Aronowsky said, adding that homeowners will take the brunt of the economic hardships of the extreme weather that is predicted to increase as global temperatures continue to rise.\n\n\"We're going to see more and more insurance companies dropping the homeowners from policies, Americans getting hit with exorbitant insurance premiums,\" she said. \"So, it's really a looming political crisis.\"\n\nHarris said that young Americans \"care deeply\" about climate change. It's because they've seen first-hand how climate change can affect their lives, Moffitt said.\n\n\"It is an issue that a lot of Americans really care about, especially young voters,\" Moffitt told ABC News.\n\nVice President and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris and former US President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speak during a presidential debate at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, Sept. 10, 2024. Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\n\nTrump did not answer the question on climate change, instead focusing on jobs that he said are no longer in existence due to Chinese-owned auto plants being built in Mexico.\n\n\"They lost 10,000 manufacturing jobs this last month,\" Trump said. \"It's going -- they're all leaving.\"\n\nInvesting in the clean energy industry will actually create more jobs, Abraham said. The U.S. now has an opportunity to participate in the green energy economy to power the country, which will create high-tech, high-paid jobs, he said.\n\n\"I think it's a real missed opportunity for Republicans,\" Abraham said. \"If you're a fiscal conservative, you want to be part of this new energy economy and make money off it.\"\n\nClean energy employment increased by 142,000 jobs in 2023, according to a U.S. Department of Energy report released last month.\n\nWith the passing of the landmark Inflation Reduction Act, the Biden administration has made more progress than any previous administration on environmental policy, the experts said.\n\nBut environmental advocates and policymakers will have to find a way going forward to help the public understand how climate change will affect Americans in their everyday lives, Aronowsky said.\n\n\"It's becoming clear that talking about climate as a ... standalone issue is a political dead end,\" she said.\n\nABC News' Kelly Livingston contributed to this report.",

        "text": "2024 US election: Kamala Harris's transformation\nWhen it comes to Donald Trump, there are certain signs that can't be mistaken. By insisting, on September 11, that his debate with Kamala Harris the previous day had been \"rigged,\" the former president effectively admitted that he had not exactly shone in the face of the solid performance given by the Democratic presidential candidate. The vice president's appearance had been eagerly awaited, and she didn't disappoint her camp.\n\nRead more Subscribers only Harris, on offense, wins debate against Trump\n\nAfter approaching her opponent in the opening moments of the debate to force him into a handshake he had not anticipated, she skilfully played on Trump's inflated ego to draw him into the pitfalls in which he has invariably become entangled, whether it be the quality of his campaign rallies or his fascination with dictators.\n\nIn doing so, Harris continued down the path to a spectacular political transformation. Joe Biden's decision to withdraw from the presidential race on July 21, after a disastrous debate with Trump, has in less than eight weeks transformed a somewhat fallible vice president, of mediocre popularity, into a candidate adored by the Democratic camp, capable of rallying huge crowds seduced by a pro-active, forward-looking discourse.\n\nRead more Subscribers only Kamala Harris seeks to embody a reconciled and optimistic America\n\nThe September 10 debate also demonstrated, however, that this transformation is still incomplete. The rushed and highly unusual conditions of her nomination did not allow Harris to develop the carefully considered political plan, traditionally polished during primaries, that would give her candidacy its full weight. Her reluctance to answer questions \u2013 she has only granted one interview since the president stepped down from the race \u2013 leaves those about her objectives and the means to achieve them unanswered.\n\nThe undecided\n\nFirst and foremost her responses to the issues voters are most concerned by \u2013 the economy, even if inflation is currently falling, and immigration, a challenge facing many Western governments \u2013 which are often deemed insufficient. Nor has Harris tackled another challenge head-on: that of linking her candidacy to the administration she has been part of for more than three and a half years, whose record has been harshly judged by American voters.\n\nAfter a successful start to the campaign, a unifying nomination convention and a successful first debate, Harris needs to go further to maintain, and above all strengthen, the momentum behind her. A successful debate in September is no guarantee of success in November, as Hillary Clinton found out to her cost in 2016, and polling data confirms that the presidential race remains particularly uncertain in the key states.\n\nUntil now, the Democrat has played a virtuoso role in relieving her camp after the withdrawal of Biden, who was heading for an inevitable defeat due to his age and physical limitations. She now has to convince the few undecided voters, in a country deeply divided in two, that she is the person best equipped to respond to their concerns. She still needs to flesh out what a Harris presidency might look like.",

        "text": "Under both Trump and Biden-Harris, US oil and gas production surged, despite different energy goals \u2022 Alaska Beacon\nThe United States is producing more oil and natural gas today than ever before, and far more than any other country. So, what roles did the Trump-Pence and Biden-Harris administrations play in this surge?\n\nThe answer might surprise you, given the way each has talked publicly about fossil fuels: former President Donald Trump embracing them, and President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris focusing on reducing fossil fuel use to fight climate change.\n\nUnder each of the three most recent presidencies, Republican and Democratic alike, U.S. oil and gas production was higher at the end of the administration\u2019s term than at the beginning.\n\nThat production has both pros and cons. Together, oil and gas account for nearly three-quarters of U.S. energy consumption. Producing oil and gas in the U.S. provides energy security, and high production generally keeps prices down. Burning oil and gas, however, releases carbon dioxide into the air, contributing to climate change. And natural gas is mostly methane \u2013 another potent greenhouse gas.\n\nAs a scholar who works on both energy and public policy, I follow the federal government\u2019s actions involving oil, gas and coal. With Trump and Harris facing off in the November presidential election, let\u2019s take a look at how each influenced fossil fuel production and emissions.\n\nBoosting and restricting oil and gas drilling\n\nBoth the Trump-Pence administration and the Biden-Harris administration took actions that supported additional oil and gas drilling. Both also took actions that restricted additional oil and gas drilling.\n\nTrump has been aggressively pro-fossil fuels in his rhetoric and actions, dating back to his first run for office. Under his administration, the federal government leased more land for drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska and in the Utah wilderness.\n\nTo further help the industry, Trump urged agencies to waive environmental reviews and loosen regulations in ways that could speed up permits for pipeline construction and other energy infrastructure.\n\nThe Trump administration also opened more U.S. coastal waters for oil and gas leasing, but Trump later rolled this back, banning coastal drilling for 10 years in the eastern Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic coasts of Florida, Georgia and South Carolina. At the time, opposition to drilling in those states threatened several Republican candidates\u2019 2020 election bids.\n\nThe Biden-Harris administration focused on clean energy and climate change. It issued several regulations targeting fossil fuels, including efforts to reduce methane leaks from natural gas pipelines and increasing the royalties that companies pay for production on federal lands. In 2021, it issued a moratorium on new federal leases for oil and gas, but that was blocked by a federal judge.\n\nHowever, the Biden-Harris administration also gave the go-ahead for the nation\u2019s largest oil drilling operation, ConocoPhillips\u2019 vast Willow project in Alaska. And the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, considered the administration\u2019s signature climate law, included additional oil and gas leasing and incentives to capture carbon dioxide for use in enhanced oil recovery.\n\nChoices in one administration affect the next\n\nWhen land is leased for drilling, it takes some years for production to begin. So, the increased oil and gas production during the Biden administration is to some extent a result of leases issued during the Trump administration. Trump auctioned off the leases; the Biden administration signed the permits.\n\nIn many cases, presidents have little discretion and are essentially required to approve when permits meet the legal requirements.\n\nGlobal events can also have large effects on production.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic reduced U.S. oil demand as activity slowed worldwide in 2020.\n\nRussia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 led to greater energy demand from Europe. Natural gas has to be liquefied to ship it overseas, however, and the U.S. has limited export capacity. To send more supply to Europe, the U.S. had to reroute natural gas exports intended for other countries.\n\nThe Biden-Harris administration paused approvals for additional liquefied natural gas terminals in 2024, but a federal judge blocked the move.\n\nWhat caused oil production to surge?\n\nDrilling technology has been an important driver of the industry\u2019s success.\n\nU.S. oil production had reached a peak in 1970 and went into a slow decline that lasted more than three decades. It was widely believed that the U.S. had pumped its best reservoirs and that the country would be inexorably dependent on foreign oil.\n\nThen, in the early 2000s, innovations in hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling changed everything. These techniques gave drillers access to previously hard-to-reach fossil fuels and opened up opportunities for oil and gas drilling at lower cost and in greater quantities. Since around 2009, U.S. oil production has surged.\n\nNatural gas followed a similar trajectory. U.S. natural gas production had peaked in 1972 and leveled off. But with fracking, natural gas production has risen since around 2005. Trump supports fracking. Harris opposed fracking in the past, but she told CNN in August 2024 that she won\u2019t ban it.\n\nWhat about coal?\n\nU.S. coal production is a different story. It peaked in 2008 and has been going down sharply since then.\n\nCoal is more susceptible to government actions than oil and gas \u2013 40% of it is produced on federal land, compared with 24% for oil and 11% for natural gas. And it has seen federal policy swings.\n\nFor example, in 2016, then-President Barack Obama banned new coal-mining leases in the Powder River Basin in Montana and Wyoming, where the majority of coal production on federal land takes place. The Trump administration lifted that freeze a year later, but a court ordered a pause of Trump\u2019s move. The ban was eventually revoked by a court during the Biden administration. Then the Biden administration again ended new leases in the Powder River Basin.\n\nBut coal\u2019s decline was also about economics. As natural gas became cheaper, it increasingly replaced coal in U.S. electricity production.\n\nThe decrease in coal production is the main reason U.S. carbon dioxide emissions have been falling even as fossil fuel production rises. Rising renewable energy production and increasing efficiency in some technologies have also helped cut emissions.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nTrump can take credit for allowing more leases for oil and gas drilling. The Biden-Harris administration, while it issued permits for oil and gas drilling and production increased on its watch, established several rules to limit greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels.\n\nPresidents\u2019 actions can matter for the industry\u2019s future, but the major factors in U.S. oil and gas production so far have been increased production efficiency, increased global demand and the lower cost of natural gas compared with coal.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

        "text": "Exploring Young Women's Leftward Expansion\nWomen aged 18 to 29 today are more liberal than young women in the past on specific issues, particularly the environment and abortion\n\nWASHINGTON, D.C. -- A surge in young women who identify as politically liberal in recent years goes beyond the label, extending particularly to their stances on the environment and abortion. It is also strongly echoed in their heightened unease with gun laws and race relations.\n\nAccording to a new Gallup analysis, much higher proportions of 18- to 29-year-old women today than women of this age range about a decade ago hold the prevailing liberal perspectives on these four issues.\n\nYoung women\u2019s stances on several other issues -- including the death penalty, healthcare policy, labor unions, taxes, government regulation and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict -- have become moderately more liberal, while their views on defense spending and a few others show little change. Young men have also moved closer to the liberal positions on most issues, just not as markedly as young women have.\n\nThese findings are based on a review of more than 50 Gallup trends -- 24 measuring Americans\u2019 policy preferences on specific issues, 11 measuring their satisfaction with U.S. conditions in different realms and 19 measuring how much they worry about many of these same areas. The analysis groups yearly results for each measure into three multiyear time periods to allow for reliable estimates of the views of 18- to 29-year-old men and women. It then contrasts these groups\u2019 views with those of men and women 30 and older.\n\nThe analysis also looks at whether the increasing proportion of women enrolled in higher education relative to men explains the recent surge in young women\u2019s identification as politically liberal. However, for most variables reviewed, gender is the key predictor of attitudes, not educational attainment.\n\nOne of These Trends Is Not Like the Others\n\nFrom 2001 to 2016, women aged 18 to 29 were more likely than their male counterparts as well as older men and women to identify as politically liberal. However, as Gallup has reported previously, a recent jump in young women\u2019s liberal identity, not matched by the other groups, has widened the gaps, particularly with young men.\n\nThe three periods used throughout this analysis to summarize Gallup\u2019s trends capture successive increases in young women\u2019s liberal identity since the start of the 21st century.\n\nIn the first period, from 2001-2007, an average of 28% of women aged 18-29 identified as liberal, three percentage points higher than young men. This period coincides with most of George W. Bush\u2019s presidency, an era dominated by the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, including the Iraq War.\n\nIn the second period, from 2008-2016, an average of 32% of young women identified as liberal, five points higher than for young men. This period coincides with the political era featuring Barack Obama -- first as a Democratic candidate for president and then as president.\n\nIn the third, from 2017-2024, an average of 40% of young women identified as liberal, 15 points higher than for young men. This period coincides with the presidencies of Donald Trump and Joe Biden, as well as a record increase in women -- mostly Democratic -- elected to Congress, governorships and state legislatures.\n\nThese three periods essentially show how the views of 18- to 29-year-olds have changed over the past two decades, with -- in varying proportions in each period -- Gen X, millennials and Gen Z mostly constituting the young adult subgroup.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nFor the remaining analysis, this article will focus on changes in young women\u2019s views on specific policy or cultural matters, to see if these align with -- or shed light on -- the recent increase in liberal self-identification among young women. The analysis mostly compares changes between 2008-2016 (effectively the Obama era) and 2017-2024 (the Trump/Biden period), when young women\u2019s identification as politically liberal increased the most.\n\nBecause the latest period encompasses eight years, this analysis does not offer precise estimates of young women\u2019s current views but is intended to identify issues that may help explain the surge in their liberal identity since the Obama era. These issues, in turn, could account for the widening of the gender gap in young adults\u2019 self-professed political ideology.\n\nOn Average, Young Women Growing More Aligned With Liberals; Young Men, With Moderates\n\nTo quantify how young women\u2019s views have changed, and how this compares with the views of young men, a statistical analysis was performed using the Gallup database of 54 issue-related questions. The percentages of young women and young men giving liberal-leaning responses to these questions were calculated for each time period and, for reference, these scores were then compared with the scores among conservatives, moderates and liberals aged 30 and older.\n\nIn 2001-2007, young women\u2019s views were closer to those of liberals aged 30+ than conservatives 30+ on 63% of the issues reviewed. This increased to 78% in 2008-2016 and 87% in 2017-2024. Separately, the analysis shows that young women\u2019s views also moved closer to liberals and further from moderates, with their more-liberal-than-moderate responses rising from 33% in the Bush era to 55% in the Trump/Biden era.\n\nThe same analysis applied to young men shows far less change in their ideological proximity to older liberals, moderates or conservatives than is true for young women. In 2001-2007, young men\u2019s views aligned with liberals aged 30+ more than conservatives 30+ on 47% of the issues reviewed. This increased to 57% in 2008-2016 before sliding back to 50% in 2017-2024. In other words, on the whole, young men\u2019s views have been slightly more liberal in the Trump/Biden period than they were in the Bush era, but less liberal than during the Obama era. This echoes young men\u2019s lesser likelihood of self-identifying as politically liberal between 2017 and 2024 (25%) than between 2008 and 2016 (27%). The stability of young men\u2019s political ideology suggests other issues or factors not reviewed here may be more important to their overall political identity.\n\nMeanwhile, the percentage of young men\u2019s views that are closer to those of liberals than moderates was just 24% in 2001-2007 but shrank to 17% in 2008-2016 and remains low, at 19%, in 2017-2024. Essentially, young men\u2019s views have been much closer to moderates\u2019 than to liberals\u2019 views throughout the past quarter century.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nA Sharp Left Turn in Young Women\u2019s Policy Preferences\n\nWhile the above statistics summarize how young women\u2019s ideological positions on the issues have changed overall, it is also important to understand their shifting views on specific issues.\n\nFor this, Gallup reviewed 24 questions from its trends archive that measure Americans' beliefs or positions on widely debated policy-related issues, and that Gallup has asked frequently enough to produce sufficient sample sizes of young men and women across the three periods. The available questions assessing each issue use a variety of question-and-answer formats, making it difficult to know precisely which issues may have been most influential to young women\u2019s heightened liberal identity. However, differences in the magnitude of changes in young women\u2019s views could indicate the relative importance of the issues.\n\nOn five of these, the percentage of young women holding the liberal position has increased by more than 15 points. These have to do with the environment, abortion and gun laws.\n\nAfter showing no change between the Bush and Obama eras, the average percentage of young women saying human activity is responsible for global warming jumped 20 points to 86% in the Trump/Biden period.\n\njumped 20 points to 86% in the Trump/Biden period. Similarly, since the Obama era, young women have become 19 points more likely to choose protection of the environment over economic growth when asked which goal should be prioritized. Seventy-eight percent now hold this view, up from 59% in 2008-2016. When asked about government\u2019s role in protecting the environment, young women have become 18 points more likely to believe the U.S. is doing too little in this regard (rising from 62% in 2008-2016 to 80% in 2017-2024).\n\nover economic growth when asked which goal should be prioritized. Seventy-eight percent now hold this view, up from 59% in 2008-2016. When asked about government\u2019s role in protecting the environment, young women have become 18 points more likely to believe the U.S. is doing too little in this regard (rising from 62% in 2008-2016 to 80% in 2017-2024). Young women have become 18 points more likely to support broad abortion rights , saying abortion should be legal under any or most circumstances (rather than in only a few or no circumstances). Their preference for this position rose from 42% to 60% between 2008-2016 and 2017-2024.\n\n, saying abortion should be legal under any or most circumstances (rather than in only a few or no circumstances). Their preference for this position rose from 42% to 60% between 2008-2016 and 2017-2024. They have become 16 points more likely to say gun laws should be stricter (rising from 58% to 74%).\n\nNotwithstanding their slightly lower liberal self-identification, young men have also become more likely to hold the liberal positions on these issues, but the increases have been smaller. As a result, the associated gender gaps between young women and men have widened substantially.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nMeanwhile, young women have become 10 to 15 percentage points more likely to embrace the liberal-leaning positions on questions about the death penalty, doctor-assisted suicide, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the legalization of marijuana, the government\u2019s role in guaranteeing healthcare coverage for all, their overall abortion stance, support for labor unions, immigration levels and the legality of same-sex marriage.\n\nYoung women\u2019s views have shifted to the left, but by less than 10 points, on corporate and upper-income taxes, business regulation, prioritizing the environment over energy production, the moral acceptability of embryonic stem-cell research, defense spending, support for an independent Palestinian state and banning handguns between the Obama era and Trump/Biden periods.\n\nAgain, the changes in young men\u2019s views have been more muted, often lagging behind women\u2019s by 10 or more points in the increased liberal percentage, or not changing to a significant degree in the case of issues where young women became only moderately or slightly more liberal.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nThe difference between the amount that young women\u2019s and young men\u2019s support for liberal positions on issues has increased in recent years contrasts with more comparable changes seen between women and men aged 30 and older. Both groups of older adults became slightly more likely to identify as liberal, overall, and it\u2019s the rare issue where support for the liberal position didn\u2019t increase as much among men as it did among women.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nThe percentages of young women and men holding each issue position at each time period, as well as the figures for women and men 30 and older, are available upon request.\n\nWomen Also Markedly Less Content With Conditions in Some Areas\n\nAdditional insights into how young women\u2019s political priorities may have changed in recent years are provided by Gallup\u2019s annual measurement of Americans\u2019 satisfaction with 11 aspects of the country. Gallup data show that liberals are typically much more concerned than conservatives are about each of these.\n\nMirroring the top three policy issues on which young women have moved to the left, young women have grown much more dissatisfied in recent years with gun laws, the quality of the environment and abortion policy. They are also significantly more discontent with race relations. This is evidenced by increases of about 20 points in the percentages saying they are \u201cvery dissatisfied\u201d with each.\n\nYoung women\u2019s dissatisfaction with healthcare, poverty and homelessness, and issues related to corporations has risen more modestly. There has been no meaningful change in young women\u2019s dissatisfaction with income and wealth distribution, what Americans pay in taxes, and the acceptance of gays and lesbians, while they have become less dissatisfied with immigration.\n\nYoung men's views have changed far less than young women's on most of these satisfaction items, suggesting less intensity of feeling on young men\u2019s part about the issues.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nAgain, the differences in recent shifts in policy positions expressed by older women are generally much smaller than those of younger women. However, race relations is an exception, as strong dissatisfaction has increased as much among women aged 30+ (18 points) as among women aged 18 to 29. As for men, dissatisfaction with these aspects of the country has increased at least as much, if not more, among older men as among younger men on most of these items.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nSurge in Young Women\u2019s Concern About Race Relations Outpaces Other Issues\n\nSeparately, each March, Gallup measures the amount Americans worry about a variety of issues as part of its annual Environment survey. This includes 13 domestic issues rated in a question focused on broad national policy areas and six specific environmental issues included in a different question focused on environmental policy.\n\nYoung women have grown more concerned about race relations since 2008-2016 than about any other broad aspect of the country rated. The 24-point increase in those worried a great deal about this is more than double the increase in concern about the quality of the environment (+11) and three times their increased concern about hunger and homelessness (+8). At the same time, their concern about drug use, healthcare, illegal immigration and terrorism hasn\u2019t changed, while they harbor less concern about crime, Social Security, energy supplies, and several aspects of the economy.\n\nYoung women have grown much more concerned about most of the environmental issues rated, including global warming (up 22 points), the extinction of animal or plant species (+20) and loss of tropical rain forests (+16). Their concern about air pollution hasn't changed.\n\nMeanwhile, young women have become moderately more concerned about the quality of the environment, generally (+11), pollution of waterways (+11) and pollution of drinking water (+10). They have grown only slightly more concerned about hunger and homelessness (+8).\n\nYoung men also show increasing concern about race relations, the quality of the environment, and hunger and homelessness, but to a lesser degree than young women do. When it comes to specific environmental issues, young men\u2019s concerns have not shifted or have shifted only marginally compared with the bigger jumps seen among young women.\n\nSimilar to the trends among young men, young women have been less concerned in recent years than in 2008-2016 about Social Security, energy, unemployment, the federal deficit and the economy.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nOlder women are also more likely than their male counterparts to have grown more concerned about race relations in recent years, with the percentage worried a great deal increasing 22 points, versus 15 points for older men. But their concern about all other issues measured has changed at about the same rate.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nThe Political and Social Context for Young Women\u2019s Identity Evolution\n\nAligning Gallup\u2019s annual trend in young women\u2019s liberal identification with major news events that occurred each year suggests that the political and cultural environment had little impact on young women\u2019s politics from 2001 through 2014. Although there were significant news events concerning the environment and healthcare, as well as mass shootings and an emerging focus on young Black men being killed by police, the percentage of young women identifying as liberal showed little change from one year to the next. Rather, it increased gradually, and unevenly, from an average 28% in the Bush era to an average 32% during the Obama era.\n\nHowever, in 2015, young women\u2019s liberal ID rose above 32% for the first time, to 34%, and it\u2019s gradually increased to 41% in the first half of 2024. This spans the Supreme Court\u2019s legalization of gay marriage in its 2015 Obergefell v. Hodges decision, Donald Trump\u2019s emergence as the leading Republican political figure in 2015 and Hillary Clinton\u2019s nomination for president in 2016, a landmark event for women.\n\nSince then, the country has experienced Trump\u2019s first year in office in 2017, during which the #MeToo movement against sexual abuse gained prominence; a record number of women being seated in Congress in 2019; the 2020 coronavirus pandemic and presidential election; the overturning of Roe v. Wade by the Supreme Court in 2022; and another presidential election featuring Trump, in 2024.\n\nWhether one or more of these events, or numerous others that have taken place since 2015, are responsible for the rise in young women\u2019s liberal identity isn't evident from the data, but something has clearly prompted a change. It is also possible that Americans\u2019 increasing use of social media as a news source has influenced young women differently than it has others. Two factors that don't seem explanatory are education and racial or ethnic diversity.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nYoung Women More Liberal Regardless of College Status\n\nThe role of education in these trends is limited. In general, college-educated adults -- those who have graduated from or have attended some college -- are more likely to identify as liberal and hold liberal views on issues than are adults who have not attended college. However, the percentage of women attending college has been relatively constant, at around 60%, over the three time periods reviewed for this analysis. So, it cannot be said that women have become more likely to identify as politically liberal because they are more likely to be attending college.\n\nThroughout the time periods reviewed, college-educated women have been consistently more liberal than women with no college education. However, since 2008-2016, both groups have become more likely to identify as politically liberal, and to a similar degree -- up eight points among women who have attended or graduated from college, and nine points among young women with no college experience. For their part, young men have become slightly less likely to identify as liberal, regardless of their college experience.\n\nMeanwhile, liberalism has increased more modestly -- by just two to four points -- among college-educated and less-educated women 30 and older.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nStill, college-educated young men have been consistently more likely than their noncollege counterparts to identify as liberal. Thus, the fact that fewer young men (46%) in 2017-2024 were attending college during that period than was the case for young men in 2008-2016 (53%) may be contributing to the slight decline in young men\u2019s liberal ID.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nCultural Diversity Not a Factor in Growing Liberalism Among Youth\n\nToday\u2019s young adults are more racially and ethnically diverse than their predecessors, which might seem like a contributing factor to increased liberalism among this age group. However, across time, the gap in liberal identification between White women and women of color has remained one to two points, and the same consistency is seen for White men and men of color, with a four- to six-point gap.\n\nMore research needs to be done on how the two groups differ on policy issues, but at least in terms of their basic ideology, cultural diversification does not appear to be driving the rise in liberal identity among young women. Liberal identity has increased by eight to nine points among White women as well as women of color between the Obama and Trump/Biden eras, while it has decreased slightly among both groups of young men.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nImplications\n\nYoung adult women in the U.S. today have not simply embraced the \u201cliberal\u201d label to a much greater extent than previous cohorts of young women, but they are more likely to hold liberal positions on specific policy issues. Their particularly strong adoption of more liberal positions on the environment and abortion, and their heightened concern about race and gun policy, could indicate these issues have had an outsized influence on their broader political identity.\n\nStill, despite the political salience of these issues for over two decades, only in the past few years has young women\u2019s identification as liberal taken off, creating a major gap between them and young men as well as older women. The timing relative to real-world events suggests that either the nature of the issue debates has changed or other developments during this period have served as catalysts for turning young women\u2019s underlying liberal tendencies into a greater willingness to wear the label.\n\nExamples could be young women reaching a tipping point on gun violence from the cumulative effect of mass shootings, or reaching a similar tipping point on race relations after George Floyd\u2019s killing in 2020. Looking beyond issues, Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaigns and term in office could have also played a role, as could the emergence of several prominent young women on the national stage. Having Democratic leaders like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez advocate for the \u201cGreen New Deal,\u201d Gen Z activist Greta Thunberg make the case for taking action on the environment, and social media influencer Olivia Julianna fight for reproductive rights in Texas may serve as political North Stars for many young women. In totality, these events are at least part of the environment in which the latest cohort of young women have learned about politics and decided what issues matter to them, helping to shape their distinct attitudes.\n\nThe fact that young men have resisted the liberal label despite becoming more liberal in many of their specific views supports the idea that a peripheral factor is influencing how young women, but not young men, define their politics. Either way, the consolidation of young women's liberal identity could make them a potent political segment in this year's election. It makes them an important bloc for Kamala Harris to turn out to vote, and therefore, one Donald Trump can\u2019t completely ignore, in their respective attempts to win the presidency in November.\n\nTo stay up to date with the latest Gallup News insights and updates, follow us on X @Gallup.\n\nLearn more about how the Gallup Poll Social Series works.\n\nJonathan Rothwell, Ph.D., contributed analysis to this report,\n\n###Embeddable###",

        "text": "Trump refuses to debate Harris again before November election \u2022 South Dakota Searchlight\nAfter a poor showing in Tuesday night\u2019s ABC News presidential debate, Republican nominee Donald Trump said Thursday in a post to his social media platform he will not participate in any more debates with Democratic candidate Vice President Kamala Harris before the Nov. 5 election.\n\nFormer President Trump and Harris had differing proposals for a future debate. Trump pushed for an NBC News-hosted meeting on Sept. 25 and Harris\u2019 campaign team said immediately after the Tuesday event that she wanted another debate sometime in October. Fox News had offered to host an October debate.\n\nBut Trump put in definitive terms Thursday that he would not take part in another debate with Harris. He claimed victory in Tuesday\u2019s meeting \u2013 which initial polls show Harris got the better of \u00ad\u2013 and compared Harris\u2019 call for a rematch with that of a boxer who\u2019d lost.\n\nHarris\u2019 time would be better spent working to solve the country\u2019s myriad problems, he said.\n\n\u201cWhen a prizefighter loses a fight, the first words out of his mouth are, \u2018I WANT A REMATCH.\u2019 Polls clearly show that I won the Debate against Comrade Kamala Harris, the Democrats\u2019 Radical Left Candidate, on Tuesday night, and she immediately called for a Second Debate,\u201d Trump wrote in the Truth Social post.\n\n\u201cKAMALA SHOULD FOCUS ON WHAT SHE SHOULD HAVE DONE DURING THE LAST ALMOST FOUR YEAR PERIOD. THERE WILL BE NO THIRD DEBATE!\u201d he added.\n\nIn her own tweet roughly an hour after Trump\u2019s, Harris renewed her call for another debate.\n\n\u201cTwo nights ago, Donald Trump and I had our first debate,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe owe it to the voters to have another debate.\u201d\n\nIn an average of three national polls compiled by 538, the polling news and data division of ABC News, 57% of respondents said Harris won the debate and 34% said Trump won. That included a Republican-sponsored survey.\n\nTrump and conservative allies spent the post-debate period Tuesday night and Wednesday morning arguing that ABC News moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis were biased in favor of Harris.\n\nTrump and several others complained that the moderators fact-checked Trump, including on false claims about infanticide and migrants eating pets in Ohio, while not doing the same to Harris.\n\nThere will be one more debate, though \u2014 between vice presidential nominees U.S. Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio, a Republican, and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, who are scheduled to meet Oct. 1 in New York City.\n\nTrump debated President Joe Biden in June when Biden was the presumptive Democratic nominee. The president\u2019s poor performance in that debate spurred his exit from the race \u2014 and Harris\u2019 arrival \u00ad\u2014 weeks later.",

        "text": "Debate Ripples Across Country and Into Donor Pockets: Sept. 11 Campaign News\nFormer President Donald J. Trump\u2019s performance in Tuesday night\u2019s debate is likely to exacerbate the widening financial gap that he faces with Vice President Kamala Harris, who is now enjoying her eighth week of momentum with big and small donors alike.\n\nSeveral large donors and fund-raising activists for Mr. Trump, along with their advisers, described the debate as a significant missed opportunity for him to firm up his support with voters and major contributors. At the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee in July, Mr. Trump\u2019s financial backers were giddy to the point of almost overconfident. Now, his wealthy supporters are confronting the possibility that they may be dramatically outspent.\n\nDebates are pivotal to both high- and low-dollar fund-raising. In interviews late on Tuesday and on Wednesday, while Mr. Trump\u2019s backers echoed his complaint that the debate moderators had been unfair to him, many also said that he should have persisted regardless and that they believed he had lost the encounter.\n\nDoug Deason, a Texas fund-raiser who watched the debate with his billionaire father, Darwin Deason, described the debate as \u201cpainful to watch\u201d given his distaste for Ms. Harris and his frustration with the moderators and with Mr. Trump\u2019s undisciplined performance.\n\n\u201cHe just can\u2019t sit and discuss policy,\u201d Mr. Deason said. \u201cHe had many opportunities to expose her lies and failed on most.\u201d\n\nKeith Rabois, a venture capitalist who along with his husband has donated millions of dollars to pro-Trump groups, said he had fielded nervous messages from friends about Mr. Trump\u2019s debate performance up until his closing statement, which Mr. Rabois considered strong.\n\n\u201cHe got distracted and missed a lot of easy opportunities to put a nail in her coffin,\u201d Mr. Rabois said. \u201cHe was not at his best.\u201d\n\nMr. Rabois is hosting Senator JD Vance of Ohio, Mr. Trump\u2019s running mate, for a fund-raiser on Thursday at his condo in New York City, and expects to raise more than $1 million for their campaign there. He said he expected Mr. Vance to \u201cfix\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s debate performance by more precisely prosecuting the anti-Harris case in his debate against her running mate, Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, on Oct. 1.\n\nElon Musk, the wealthiest person in the world and one of Mr. Trump\u2019s biggest backers, wrote on X that Ms. Harris \u201cexceeded most people\u2019s expectations tonight.\u201d He did not defend Mr. Trump\u2019s performance.\n\nMr. Trump suffered from a financial deficit through the spring against President Biden, then the presumptive Democratic nominee. He managed to overtake Mr. Biden\u2019s resources by June 1. But since Ms. Harris replaced Mr. Biden at the top of the ticket, she has been on an eight-week fund-raising binge that has included almost tripling Mr. Trump\u2019s financial tally in August.\n\nThe presidential debate on Tuesday energize her biggest donors, some of whom gathered across the country to spend the evening together, as well as the low-dollar givers who have overwhelmed her campaign.\n\nOver $1 billion has been raised on ActBlue, the processing platform for donations to progressives, since Mr. Biden dropped out of the race on July 21, according to a New York Times analysis. And in the hours since the beginning of Tuesday\u2019s debate, Democrats have raised $43 million on the platform. Tuesday was the best fund-raising day on ActBlue since the day that Mr. Walz was chosen as Ms. Harris\u2019s running mate.\n\nCampaign fund-raising hauls are driven in large part by marquee events like debates and nominating conventions. It is not clear if Mr. Trump has any big moments remaining on his calendar, with additional debates uncertain and especially now that his sentencing in his criminal case in Manhattan will not happen until after Election Day.\n\nThe Trump campaign did not return a request for comment on its financial standing.\n\nThe cash advantage has allowed Ms. Harris to build a more omnipresent campaign. For instance, in July, the most recent month with spending records publicly available, Ms. Harris\u2019s campaign committee spent more than triple what Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign committee did \u2014 $81 million, compared with $24 million, with the split primarily manifesting itself in advertising.\n\nAnd from now until Election Day, Ms. Harris and her allies are set to outspend Mr. Trump and his allies on television and radio by $131million, according to AdImpact, with spending advantages in every state. The concern for Republicans is that in a close election decided by small margins, Mr. Trump could find himself outspent in decisive ways.\n\nMr. Trump also has built a far smaller campaign operation than Ms. Harris, who claims to have more than 2,000 staff members on the payroll in coordination with Democratic Party groups. Mr. Trump\u2019s field campaign, for instance, has substantially outsourced its canvassing work to outside groups such as Turning Point Action, the Faith & Freedom Coalition and America PAC, a super PAC that is expected to be largely funded by Mr. Musk.\n\nMr. Musk\u2019s super PAC has recently been successfully persuading some major donors beyond its initial backers to support the group, according to two people briefed on the super PAC\u2019s activities.\n\nThat matters because Mr. Trump has struggled to expand his reservoir of financial backers since his 2020 presidential run. Some major Republican donors have resisted giving to Mr. Trump. For instance, Ken Griffin, the chief executive of Citadel who spent over $100 million on the 2022 midterm cycle, has yet to support Mr. Trump after backing former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley during the Republican primary. A person with knowledge of his thinking said on Wednesday that nothing has changed \u2014 Mr. Griffin, one of the most influential donors in Wall Street circles, is still channeling his giving only to House and Senate Republicans.\n\nAnd so entering the homestretch of the presidential race, he remains extraordinarily reliant on just a few major donors who seem to be keeping him competitive in the world of paid media.\n\nA coterie of billionaires, including Mr. Musk, Timothy Mellon, Miriam Adelson and Ike Perlmutter, is collectively putting in hundreds of millions of dollars into supporting Mr. Trump.\n\nThat, some Republicans noted, serves as something of a bulwark against any campaign missteps by Mr. Trump: Someone like Mr. Mellon can, with the stroke of a check, allow Republicans to close the advertising gap rather quickly.\n\nStill, the Republican ticket\u2019s travel schedule speaks to some of the financial pressure it is under: Mr. Trump, who did not headline many fund-raisers over the summer, frustrating some of his own major donors, is spending precious time after the debate appearing at finance events to refill his coffers, traveling to noncompetitive states like Utah and California for high-dollar events alongside his public rallies out West. Mr. Vance is headlining two events in New York on Thursday, including Mr. Rabois\u2019s, and one in Louisiana on Friday. He will also raise money in Washington, D.C., next week.\n\nOn Wednesday, Republicans were invited to four events with Mr. Vance in Texas on Sept. 22 and Sept. 24, including an Austin fund-raiser thrown by Joe Lonsdale, an influential tech executive who is an ally of Mr. Musk, and another by Ray Washburne, a powerful Dallas developer who is a mainstay of the Republican fund-raising circuit.\n\nMs. Harris, by contrast, is not scheduled to appear at any finance events other than an event in Washington on Saturday. She has the advantage of celebrity surrogates to headline fund-raising events on her behalf \u2014 when the most precious resource she has is not money but her time.",

It can be challenging to identify independent voters by nature. All social groups who don't strongly identify as Republicans or Democrats are included in this term, regardless of their circumstances.Due to the similar local influences, conversations, and policy concerns that shape independent voters, it can be challenging to forecast how independents will vote nationally. However, statewide data may be more insightful.Except for Arizona, where Trump leads by a significant +14 points, Harris leads among independents in all of the swing states. The data comes from a series of fresh Morning Consult surveys conducted through September 8. State-by-state variation is evident in the preferences of independent voters for the next president; in the swing states, Harris's lead ranges from +20 points in Wisconsin to just +5 in Pennsylvania.Independents are not just about swing states. According to the polls, independent voters are supporting Harris in two predominantly Republican states where Trump has won the past two elections. In Florida and Texas, Trump leads by +2 and +9 points, respectively. However, when examining independent voters alone, the numbers shift in favour of Harris winning the presidency, with the Democratic nominee in Florida holding a sizable +10-point advantage.The debate in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, will be significant for both presidential campaigns. This poll shows that Harris leads among the independents but with a small margin compared to the other states. The economic condition of Pennsylvania is considered the most important issue that concerns the voters; this issue is seen as the most important one by 58% of them. Arizona leads overall and among independent voters, with 27 % believing the economy is the most crucial issue. In Florida, independents are slightly more likely to pinpoint abortion as the most important issue (11% compared to 10%). Among independent and statewide voters, the most pressing problem is housing affordability. With Trump ahead by just +2 points, an independent swing to the left may be troublesome news for Harris's campaign.In most swing states, Harris leads among independent voters, except for Arizona, where Trump leads by +14 points.Depending on the state, independent voters prioritize matters such as the economy, immigration, the affordability of housing, and dangers to democracy.",

        "text": "New Book Explores 70 Years of US Presidential Campaign Strategy\nNew book sheds light on nearly 70 years of presidential campaign strategy A Northeastern political scientist provides a sweeping account of how the major political campaigns over the last seven decades have managed to strategically deploy their resources to game the Electoral College system. A new book, \u201cBattleground: Electoral College Strategies, Execution, and Impact in the Modern Era,\u201d explores presidential campaign strategy over time. Photo by Alyssa Stone/Northeastern University\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that politics is a game \u2014 one played with winners and losers.\n\nAnd in America, like it or not, the winner takes all.\n\nThe name of the game? It\u2019s all about getting 270 electoral votes. A new book from a Northeastern University political scientist provides a sweeping account of how the major party campaigns over the last seven decades have managed to strategically \u201cdeploy their precious resources\u201d to put together a winning coalition toward that magic number.\n\n\u201cBattleground: Electoral College Strategies, Execution, and Impact in the Modern Era,\u201d is more than 20 years in the making, says Costas Panagopoulos, distinguished professor of political science at Northeastern University and co-author of the book published by Oxford University Press.\n\n\u201cStep one was collecting this data and putting it together, which was no small task,\u201d Panagopoulos tells Northeastern Global News. \u201cEqually challenging was organizing the data in a way that allowed us to measure what we were studying consistently over time.\u201d\n\nCostas Panagopoulos, distinguished professor of political science at Northeastern University, says the book came together as a result of 20 years of research. Photo by Matthew Modoono/Northeastern University\n\nDaron R. Shaw of the University of Texas at Austin, and Scott L. Althaus of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, co-wrote the book with Panagopoulos.\n\nPanagopoulos and his colleagues drew from a vast trove of resources \u2014 records pulled from private campaign archives and presidential libraries, to insider campaign memos and other materials \u2014 to analyze electoral strategies pursued by every major political campaign between 1952 to 2020. The result represents a deep dive into the strategic choices those campaigns made in each of those cycles, at a level of detail previously unavailable.\n\n\u201cOur book focuses on state-level Electoral College strategies, how campaigns tried to get to 270. That\u2019s the broad picture,\u201d Panagopoulos says. \u201cThe book does not, however, engage how campaigns spent their money on the ground \u2014 and we don\u2019t look at what kinds of messages were featured in ads, or what audiences were targeted.\u201d\n\nWhat emerged were three distinct eras, beginning in the early 1950s, that tell the story of the evolution of presidential campaigns in terms of how they spent money, targeted voters and relayed platform and policy information to the electorate.\n\nThose time periods are described in the book as the wholesale campaigning era (1952-1972), the zero-sum campaigning era (1976-2000) and the microtargeted campaigning era (2004-2020). The wholesale campaigning era is defined by the rise of \u201cbroad-based, mass advertising,\u201d primarily on television, and the development of polling as means of gathering and analyzing data at scale. The authors note that there were few laws to regulate campaign contributions and expenditures during those earlier years.",

        "text": "Pope Francis tells US Catholics to choose \u2018lesser evil\u2019 in coming election\nWithout naming the two main US presidential candidates, the pontiff decried abortion and restrictions on immigration.\n\nPope Francis has encouraged Catholics in the United States to vote in the November elections, saying they should \u201cchoose the lesser evil\u201d while criticising both of the leading candidates.\n\nIn remarks on Friday while flying to Rome from Singapore, the pope named neither the Republican nor Democratic presidential nominees: former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, respectively.\n\nBut he offered pointed criticisms of their platforms, saying refusing to welcome immigrants is a \u201cgrave\u201d sin and abortion is akin to an \u201cassassination\u201d.\n\n\u201cNot voting is ugly,\u201d Francis said. \u201cIt is not good. You must vote.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou must choose the lesser evil,\u201d he added. \u201cWho is the lesser evil? That lady or that gentleman? I don\u2019t know. Everyone, in conscience, [has to] think and do this.\u201d\n\nThe 87-year-old pontiff made the comments as the US presidential election is entering its final weeks, with voting scheduled for November 5. While conservative on social issues like abortion, Francis has been one of the foremost critics of rich countries embracing increasingly restrictive immigration policies.\n\n\u201cWhether it is the one who is chasing away migrants or the one who kills children,\u201d the pope said, \u201cboth are against life.\u201d\n\nThe US is home to about 52 million Catholics, a conservative-leaning constituency that is well-represented in several key swing states, such as Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nPolling by the Pew Research Center indicated that about 52 percent of US Catholics identify with or lean towards the Republican Party, compared with about 44 percent for the Democratic Party. But the centre noted that the Catholics, in the past, have been \u201cclosely divided\u201d.\n\nIn his comments on Friday, which came after a 12-day tour across Southeast Asia and Oceania, Francis also lamented the lack of progress towards a peace deal to bring Israel\u2019s war in Gaza to a close.\n\n\u201cForgive me for saying so, but I don\u2019t see any progress being made towards peace,\u201d he told reporters on board the papal plane, adding that an Israeli strike on a school this week that killed Palestinian children was \u201cugly\u201d.",

        "text": "What are swing states, and why are they critical? What to know in 500 words\nA handful of US states play an outsized role in deciding presidential elections. Which are analysts watching this year?\n\nThey loom large in any coverage of the United States presidential election: the coveted \u201cswing states\u201d.\n\nUpon the rocky shoals of a small number of fiercely contested states, the dreams of many aspiring national figures have been dashed and splintered.\n\nAs their name implies, swing states \u2014 also known as battleground states \u2014 have the potential to sway the outcome of a national election.\n\nThis year looks no different, with Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump locked in a tight battle in a number of must-win states.\n\nBut what is a swing state? And why do they play such an outsized role in presidential races? We answer these questions and more in a brief explainer.\n\nWhat does the term \u2018swing state\u2019 mean?\n\nA swing state refers to a small group of states that are narrowly contested in presidential races.\n\nIn US politics, presidential elections are decided by a weighted voting system known as the Electoral College, not by the popular vote. Because of that, swing states can play an outsized role in deciding the outcome.\n\nEach of the 50 states are apportioned a certain number of Electoral College votes, in proportion to their population size. A presidential candidate must secure 270 electors to win.\n\nSince most states vote consistently with one party or another, a small number of swing states can determine victory or defeat. Candidates therefore tend to invest a great deal of resources in courting voters in those states, as opposed to party strongholds.\n\nWhich states are considered swing states?\n\nOne of the defining characteristics of a swing state is its ambiguous political leanings. But states that were once contested can start to tilt towards one party or another.\n\nFor this reason, swing states can change. Florida, for example, was considered a swing state from the 1990s through 2020, but it is now seen as reliably red, as Republican voter registration grows.\n\nThis year, the states being closely watched are Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Nevada and Minnesota. New to this clutch of swing states is North Carolina.\n\nWhat can polling tell us about swing states?\n\nTrue to form, the swing states in this election cycle show Trump and Harris in a narrow race.\n\nIn Arizona, for instance, polling averages found the two candidates virtually tied, or Trump edging out a thin advantage of one point or less.\n\nMeanwhile, in Pennsylvania, the race is also in dead heat, with polling averages showing a tie or Harris ahead by less than 1 percent.\n\nMinnesota is the only one of the potential swing states where Harris maintains a healthy lead, ahead of Trump by an average of between five and eight points.\n\nWhile voter sentiment could still change in the weeks ahead, these averages point to a race with a close finish when voters go to the polls in November. Meanwhile, both Harris and Trump have been campaigning heavily in states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Georgia, hoping to tilt the states to their side.",

        "text": "Harris-Trump debate watched by 67m people, beating pivotal Biden showdown\nAn estimated 67.1 million people watched the presidential debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, a 31% increase from the June debate between Trump and President Joe Biden that eventually led to the president dropping out of the 2024 race.\n\n\n\nThe debate was run by ABC News but shown on 17 different networks, the Nielsen company said. The Trump-Biden debate in June was seen by 51.3 million people.\n\n\n\nTuesday\u2019s count was short of the record viewership for a presidential debate, when 84 million people saw Trump\u2019s and Hillary Clinton\u2019s first face-off in 2016. The first debate between Biden and Trump in 2020 reached 73.1 million people.\n\nThere was a marked increase in younger and middle-aged viewers, with 53% more adults aged 18-49 tuning in to see Harris debate Trump than watched Biden do the same, according to Nielsen data.\n\nOf the viewers who watched on cable networks, the highest number of viewers were on Fox News, with 9.1 million people tuning in on the channel known for its positive coverage of Trump.\n\nHarris was widely seen to have won the debate. A CNN flash poll of debate watchers showed 63% to 37% that Harris had performed better. Prior to the debate, those voters were split 50-50 on who would win. Of the Harris-supporting viewers polled by CNN, 96% said she had done a better job, while 69% of Trump supporting viewers said so.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign publicly claimed victory, but some of his aides privately conceded it was unlikely that he persuaded any undecided voters to break for him, people familiar with the matter told the Guardian.\n\nThe viewership puts the debate roughly between the Seinfeld (76.3 million) and Friends (52.5 million) series finales.\n\nMinutes after it ended, Taylor swift endorsed the Harris-Walz ticket to her 283 million Instagram followers in a post that included a link to the government voter registration website Vote.gov. The site saw almost 338,000 new visitors in the hours that followed, a General Services Administration spokesperson told MSNBC.\n\nSwift\u2019s endorsement is likely to be most influential among Americans under 35, since about 30% of that group say they are more likely to vote for someone Swift supports, according to polling conducted for Newsweek. The polling found that 18% of voters say they are \u201cmore likely\u201d or \u201csignificantly more likely\u201d to vote for a Swift-backed candidate, while 17% say they are less likely.\n\nNo other debates are currently scheduled between the two presidential candidates, although the Harris campaign have asked for one, and the Fox News Channel has publicly offered alternatives. CBS will host a vice-presidential debate between Tim Walz and JD Vance on 1 October.\n\nTuesday\u2019s debate stakes were high to begin with, not only because of the impending election itself but because the last presidential debate set off a series of events that resulted in Biden\u2019s withdrawal from the race.\n\nWhile CNN chose not to correct any misstatements by the candidates during Trump\u2019s debate with Biden in June, ABC instead challenged statements that Trump made about abortion, immigration, the 2020 election and violent crime.",

        "text": "US presidential debate resonates across South Asia amid flurry of regional news\nIn a testament to the global influence of U.S. politics, this week\u2019s televised debate between former president Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris broke through an intensely busy news cycle in South Asia to garner extensive coverage across most major news outlets.\n\nThe pivotal showdown between the two contenders vying to succeed Joe Biden as U.S. president resonated with audiences across the region, overcoming a nine- to 10-hour time difference from Washington and competing with a barrage of pressing domestic headlines:\n\nIn India, opposition leader Rahul Gandhi made a high-profile visit to the United States. In Bangladesh, interim leader Muhammad Yunus delivered his second major speech to the nation. And in Pakistan, the National Assembly speaker suspended security officials over the controversial arrest of five lawmakers in the Parliament building.\n\nYet amid this flurry of regional developments, leading newspapers and TV stations from Karachi to Dhaka provided considerable coverage of the debate, reflecting heightened regional interest in the outcome of the U.S. presidential contest.\n\n\"The news cycle in these countries is so fast, and the issues they are dealing with internally are so intense that probably their focus has shifted from what is happening elsewhere,\" said Awais Saleem, a former Pakistani journalist now a professor at Lamar University in the U.S. state of Texas.\n\n\"Nonetheless, [the U.S. election] is still keenly observed and keenly watched because whatever happens in the U.S. invariably has an effect in other parts of the world, and South Asia is no exception,\u201d Saleem said.\n\nIndia\n\nTake India, the region's most populous country and largest media market. Major Indian outlets, such as NDTV and CNN's local affiliate, dedicated significant coverage to the debate, even while prioritizing Gandhi's remarks in Washington. Aaj tak, another leading channel, had a correspondent reporting on the debate from the spin room in Philadelphia.\n\nLarge-circulation newspapers provided more substantial coverage, even while relying on international wire services for content.\n\nThe Times of India, India's largest newspaper, featured a video analysis of the debate on its homepage. The Hindu, another major paper, ran multiple articles, including one focusing on Trump's pledge to end the Ukraine war and another on Hollywood's \"applause\" for Harris.\n\nWhile much of the coverage was routine, some stood out. In addition to broadcasting the debate live, NDTV produced at least 10 stories and segments dedicated to what it termed a \"fiery presidential showdown.\" These included highlights and key quotes, and major takeaways.\n\nWhile Indians are as divided over Trump and Harris as Americans, most local outlets widely reported on the American media's verdict that Harris had outperformed Trump.\n\nAhead of the debate, many Indians were skeptical of Harris, said Ashutosh, a veteran Indian journalist and co-founder of Satya Hindi. To find out how Harris did, Satya Hindi devoted a 30-minute segment featuring a U.S.-based Indian American academic, Ashutosh said.\n\nThe verdict: Harris won the debate.\n\n\"There now is a feeling that Kamala Harris is not a weak candidate,\" said Ashutosh, who goes by one name.\n\nIndia, like other South Asian countries, lacks an American-style tradition of live election debates. The concept intrigues many but faces cultural and political obstacles, experts say.\n\nOn Satya Hindi, another guest, journalist Shravan Garg, questioned their feasibility. Would Indian TV channels \"dare\" to host live debates and would politicians \"agree\" to participate, he asked.\n\nAtul Singh, founder and editor-in-chief of Fair Observer, an international citizen journalism and civic education platform, said Indian interest in U.S. elections has surged in recent years, spurred by globalization and more recently by the Indian ancestry of Harris and Usha Vance, the wife of Republican vice-presidential nominee J.D. Vance.\n\nBut he said the level of interest varies across the country. States with stronger ties to the U.S., such as Gujarat, a source of migration to the U.S., and Maharashtra, a manufacturing hub for exports to the U.S., are gripped by U.S. election fever. In more rural regions such as Bihar, with fewer connections to the U.S., enthusiasm is far more subdued.\n\n\"So it depends on which part of the country you're in,\" Singh said. \"I'd say some areas in India simply don't care, and others, the ones that are part of the global economy, are absolutely obsessed.\"\n\nPakistan, Bangladesh\n\nIn neighboring Pakistan and Bangladesh, the debate received far less coverage despite comparable public interest.\n\nGeo TV, Pakistan's leading TV news channel, ran an international segment on the debate, reporting on the candidates' \"combative demeanor.\" A wire story on its website noted that foreign policy \"largely took a backseat.\"\n\nLeading English language newspaper Dawn highlighted the debate as its top international story, reporting how Harris put Trump \"on the defensive at a combative presidential debate.\" A wire fact check about the debate was included among its \"must read stories\" on its homepage\n\nExpress Tribune, another leading newspaper, picked up multiple wire service stories about the debate, posting three short video compilations on its websites, including a video of viral memes generated by Trump's comment that migrants were eating people's cats and dogs in Ohio.\n\nAtif Khan, a Pakistani journalist, said Harris' unexpected emergence as the Democratic nominee helped boost Pakistani public interest in the U.S. presidential election.\n\n\"Every political discussion on television now involves a mention of the U.S. election,\" Khan said. \"There is talk about Trump. There is talk about Kamala Harris.\"\n\nWhile Pakistani media generally don't cover elections in neighboring countries, some local outlets are already planning their U.S. election coverage and trying to secure U.S. visas for their reporters, he said.\n\n\"Pakistanis think that a change of president will inevitably have direct implications for not just Pakistan but also the region,\" he said.\n\nUnderscoring the Pakistani media's interest, Saleem, the Lamar University professor, noted receiving weekly invitations from various outlets to discuss the U.S. election campaign.\n\nBangladesh\n\nIn Bangladesh, the debate's coverage was overshadowed by continuing reverberations from the August 5 collapse of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's government.\n\nWhile interim leader Yunus' speech dominated headlines on Wednesday, leading outlets provided more substantive coverage of the debate, drawing on international wire stories and analysis.\n\nProthom Alo, Bangladesh's largest media outlet, called the debate, \"the most important moment\" before the November 5 election.\n\nDaily Star, one of the most reputable outlets, ran at least four stories, including a fact check and a video analysis.\n\nDaily Ittefaq, a Bengali language newspaper, ran a summary of U.S. media accounts of the debate, reporting that even the conservative Fox News had declared Harris the winner.\n\nSingh, founder of Fair Observer, said the post-Hasina political turmoil in Bangladesh likely contributed to the relatively thin coverage.\n\n\"They've got their own fish to fry,\" he said.\n\nBut, he added, political elites in Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka \u2013 all dependent on the International Monetary Fund, the global finance agency, largesse \u2013 are keenly watching the U.S. election campaign.\n\n\"They are in economic crisis, so they follow the election for practical reasons,\" he said.\n\nVOA\u2019s Bangla, Deewa and Uru services contributed to this article.",

A new Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted shortly after the debate shows Harris with 47% support compared to Trump's 42%.The debate featured sharp exchanges and personal attacks. Harris questioned Trump's fitness for office and brought up his legal issues. According to the poll, 53% of voters believe Harris outperformed Trump, while 24% sided with Trump. A CNN flash poll indicated 60% of viewers felt Harris dominated the stage.Pundits have declared Harris the winner of the debate. Reuters reports that Harris \"put Trump on the defensive with a barrage of attacks on his record and legal woes,\" a view supported by 52% of poll respondents who felt Trump struggled to keep up.Previously, a New York Times/Siena College poll showed Harris trailing Trump by one point, with Trump at 48% and Harris at 47%. The new poll marks a shift in Harris' favor.Despite the positive numbers for Harris, the race remains tight, especially in battleground states like Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Wisconsin. National polls offer only a snapshot of the larger contest for electoral votes Harris' campaign has challenged Trump to a second debate. \u201cVice President Harris is ready for round two. Is Donald Trump?\u201d her team asked in a post-debate statement. Trump has not confirmed if he would participate but is considering the possibility.The next major political event will be a debate between vice presidential nominees Senator JD Vance and Governor Tim Walz, scheduled for October 1.",

        "text": "September 13, 2024, presidential campaign news\nTake a look at the positions of Kamala Harris and Donald Trump on the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, the most fraught foreign policy issue facing the country that has spurred a multitude of protests around the US since it began last October.\n\nHarris: After meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in late July, Harris gave a forceful and notable speech about the situation in Gaza. She echoed Joe Biden\u2019s repeated comments about the \u201cironclad support\u201d and \u201cunwavering commitment\u201d to Israel, as well as the need to get the Israeli hostages back from Hamas captivity. The country has a right to defend itself, she said, while noting, \u201chow it does so, matters.\u201d\n\nHowever, the empathy she expressed regarding the Palestinian plight and suffering was far more forceful than what Biden has said on the matter in recent months. She went on to describe \u201cthe images of dead children and desperate hungry people fleeing for safety, sometimes displaced for the second, third or fourth time,\u201d and said, \u201cI will not be silent.\u201d\n\nThe vice president continued calling out the plight of the people in Gaza, as well as the need to free the Israeli hostages and secure a ceasefire deal, in her acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention in August. Harris said that as president, she would maintain the US alliance with Israel and \u201censure Israel has the ability to defend itself.\u201d\n\nTrump: The former president also met with Netanyahu in July, the first such meeting between the two men since Trump left the White House more than three years ago. Trump, who often claims he was the most pro-Israel president in modern history, once touted his close, personal relationship with Netanyahu. However, their relationship has soured in recent years, and the former president has been reluctant to speak with him throughout the ongoing conflict.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of Hamas\u2019 attack on Israel, Trump criticized Netanyahu for his handling of the war, claiming to Fox News at the time the prime minister and the country overall were \u201cunprepared.\u201d\n\nMany Israelis presume that Trump would give Netanyahu a longer leash to use greater force in Gaza. Trump has said that Israel must \u201cfinish what they started,\u201d \u201cget it over with fast,\u201d and that the US must \u201clet Israel finish the job.\u201d\n\nRead more about the candidates and where they stand on key issues.",

        "text": "US Presidential Election Top 10: US Presidential Election Top 10: Is Donald Trump done as an orator?\nBiden goes MAGA: President Joe Biden (remember him) put on a Trump hat as show of solidarity on 9/11. The Trump War Room said this. \u2018Good Job\u2019: It\u2019s easy to forget that Donald Trump has a human side. The last time we glimpsed it was in his cameo in Home Alone 2, but we saw a hint of it at the Ground Zero memorial, when Trump congratulated Harris on a \u2018good job\u2019. No Curry with MAGA: Imagine telling a joke so racist that even the MAGA crowd says: \u201cBro.\u201d Laura Loomer found out the hard way that her \u201ccurry in the White House\u201d joke was too offensive, even for fellow MAGA traveller and noted anti-Semite Marjorie Taylor-Greene. Who won the debate? Pollsters say Harris won the debate comfortably but ask people to exercise caution before jumping to conclusions. Swift Effect: Can Taylor Swift swing a presidential election? We\u2019ll leave that to the experts, but since Swift endorsed Harris, her Instagram post has garnered over 9 million likes and led to over 330,000 visits to the Voter Registration website. Sororal Love: MAGA supporters are still outraged about the debate, with some pointing out that one of the ABC co-anchors is a sorority sister of Kamala Harris, which they claim is irrefutable proof that Trump was cheated. Meme Watch: \u201cThis debate was so bad, Nancy Pelosi is quietly working the phones to get Trump out of the race,\u201d said Florida Congressman Moskowitz. Here are a few more reactions. Springfield: Trump has always shown a Bart Simpson-like knack for avoiding the consequences of his actions. No wonder Springfield started trending after the debate. Daughter\u2019s Disgust: Even Elon Musk\u2019s daughter couldn\u2019t cope after seeing her father\u2019s tweet about Taylor Swift and his offer to \u201cgive\u201d her a child. It\u2019s hard to blame her. A Blast from the Past: Legend has it that America would be very different today if Barack Obama hadn\u2019t mocked Donald Trump at the 2011 White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner. Either way, Obama was in fine form in his alt-comedy persona that day. Take a walk down memory lane.\n\nMASH-UP: Trump\u2019s al-Baghdadi Speech & Obama\u2019s Bin Laden Speech\n\nHello and welcome to the US Presidential Election Top 10 , your handy guide to what matters (or doesn\u2019t) ahead of an election that all pundits say remains too close to call.One thing became largely apparent during the presidential debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump : the Don is past his oratorical prime. Unlike Donald Bradman\u2019s final innings, Trump didn\u2019t get out on a duck, but it was one of his worst performances.There was exactly one moment of vintage Trump during the debate, when he described his exchange with the \u201chead of the Taliban\u201d, most likely referring to Abdul Ghani Baradar , one of the Taliban\u2019s negotiators with the US.He said: \u201cI told Abdul, don\u2019t do it anymore. If you do it again, you\u2019re going to have problems. And he said, why did you send me a picture of my house? I said, you\u2019re going to have to figure that out, Abdul. And for 18 months, nobody was killed.\u201d It was reminiscent of when he announced that ISIS chief \u201cAbu Baker Al Bag Daddy\u201d was dead.Read: Donald Trump\u2019s Greatest Hits It became apparent to all viewers \u2013 whether MAGA supporters or members of the K-Hive \u2013 that the Donald Trump of old was gone, as the verve and vivacity that once made Trump such an avant-garde speaker with his stream-of-consciousness style were missing. Perhaps this is why he avoided the Republican primaries, where Vivek Ramaswamy stood out as his surrogate and attack dog. Before the Harris debate, Trump claimed: \u201cDonald Trump is probably the greatest political debater we\u2019ve ever had in American history.\u201d Reality begged to differ.Here are 10 stories to keep track of the US Presidential Election 2024 :BONUS: The mash-up you need and deserve",

        "text": "DHS Workforce on the Frontlines of Biden-Harris Administration\u2019s New Executive Actions to Address Surge in De Minimis Shipments and Protect American Consumers, Workers, and Businesses\nWASHINGTON \u2013 The Department of Homeland Security\u2019s workforce, particularly U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), is on the front lines of the Biden-Harris Administration\u2019s new executive actions, announced today, to protect American consumers, workers, retailers, importers, and manufacturers by tackling the exponential growth of small packages claiming the de minimis exemption. CBP plays a vital role in implementing these Executive Actions by targeting and blocking shipments that violate U.S. laws as they arrive in airports, express consignment facilities, international mail facilities, and ports of entry across the country. CBP enforces trade laws to protect consumers, eradicate forced labor from supply chains and protect U.S. workers and businesses from unfair competition, ensure national economic security, and prevent dangerous and illicit products, including illicit opioids like fentanyl, from entering the United States.\n\nThe Executive Actions announced today are designed to combat a significant increase of shipments in recent years that claim the de minimis exemption, particularly from Chinese e-commerce platforms, by strengthening information collection requirements to improve accountability and enforcement, prevent the misuse of the exemption for allowing high-volume shipments of de minimis packages, and prevent shippers from circumventing safety standards. De minimis shipments, also referred to as Section 321 low-value shipments, refer to goods that are exempt from duty and tax under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1321(a)(2)(C) and 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 10.151. The de minimis exemption allows CBP to pass free of duty and tax, merchandise imported by one person on one day that has an aggregate fair retail value in the country of shipments of $800 or less. Every day CBP processes nearly four million de minimis shipments entering the United States. Although these packages have a low value, they may pose the same potential health, consumer safety, and economic security risks as larger and more traditional containerized shipments. As of July 30, 2024, 89 percent of all seizures in the cargo environment this fiscal year originated as de minimis shipments, including 97 percent of narcotics seizures, and 72 percent of health and safety seizures of prohibited items.\n\n\u201cThe actions announced today by the Biden-Harris Administration will help the Department keep pace with global electronic commerce and improve our ability to protect communities from fentanyl and its precursor chemicals,\u201d said Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro N. Mayorkas. \u201cOur Administration remains ready and eager to work with Congress to pass badly-needed, long-overdue comprehensive de minimis reform legislation and ensure border officials have the resources and tools they need to track and target the millions of small-dollar shipments that enter our country every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s actions will give us strong tools to ensure that imported goods comply with U.S. laws that serve to protect Americans,\u201d said Robert Silvers, DHS Under Secretary for Policy and Chair of the federal Forced Labor Enforcement Task Force. \u201cWe will leave no stone unturned in keeping fentanyl out of this country. We will not tolerate forced labor in our supply chains. With regulatory and statutory updates to modernize its enforcement mechanisms, CBP will have the instruments it needs to keep illicit goods out of our markets, while facilitating the legitimate trade that is the lifeblood of our economy.\u201d\n\n\u201cCBP employs a multilayered enforcement strategy, but the fact remains we are operating under the constraints of outdated laws passed more than 30 years ago, with significant resource and enforcement limitations in a heightened threat environment,\u201d said CBP Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Commissioner, Troy Miller. \u201cThese executive actions are a critical first step in modernizing our enforcement mechanisms in the small package environment so we can better protect the health and safety of Americans. However, we still need to modernize and enhance our trade laws so that CBP can implement a more strenuous enforcement architecture to further crack down on the individuals and networks attempting to abuse the de minimis environment.\u201d\n\nThe new Executive Actions targeting the abuse of the de minimis exception and protecting U.S. consumers, workers and businesses include:\n\nNew Rulemaking to Improve Accountability and Enforcement in De Minimis Shipments: Specifically, this proposed rule would strengthen information collection requirements to promote greater visibility into de minimis shipments. That additional level of transparency would help CBP protect consumers from purchasing goods that do not meet health and safety standards, and protect U.S. workers and businesses\u2014including retailers, importers and manufacturers\u2014from unfair competition.\n\nNew Rulemaking to Reduce De Minimis Volume and Strengthen Trade Enforcement: Specifically, this proposed rule would make ineligible for the de minimis exemption shipments containing products subject to U.S. trade enforcement actions, such as those driving the increase from China-founded e-commerce platforms like low-value textiles and apparel, closing a major loophole. Those products would no longer enter the U.S. market duty free.\n\nFinal Rule to Prevent De Minimis Shipments from Circumventing Safety Standards: Specifically, this Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) proposed final rule would require importers of consumer products to file Certificates of Compliance (CoC) electronically with CBP and CPSC. That would strengthen CBP\u2019s and CPSC\u2019s ability to target and block unsafe products, and prevent foreign companies from abusing the de minimis exemption to circumvent consumer protection testing and certification requirements.\n\nThese Executive Actions will be carried out through the federal regulatory process in the coming weeks and months. For the full White House fact sheet, visit: FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Announces New Actions to Protect American Consumers, Workers, and Businesses by Cracking Down on De Minimis Shipments with Unsafe, Unfairly Traded Products\n\nThe Administration is also ready to work with Congress to pass comprehensive de minimis reform legislation by the end of the year, which is urgently needed even as these regulatory processes move forward. Key reforms Congress should advance include:\n\nExclusion from de minimis of import-sensitive products.\n\nExclusion of shipments containing products from the de minimis exemption that are covered by Section 301, Section 201, or Section 232 trade enforcement actions.\n\nPassage of previously proposed de minimis reforms in the Detect and Defeat Counter-Fentanyl Proposal. These proposed legislative reforms would, among other actions, increase transparency and accountability under the de minimis program by requiring more data from shippers, including the product tariff number, and give border officials the tools they need to more effectively track and target the millions of shipments coming in claiming the de minimis exemption. The Detect and Defeat Counter-Fentanyl proposal incorporates many of the bipartisan ideas put forward by Members of Congress, and will increase CBP\u2019s ability to detect and seize illicit drugs and their precursor chemicals, as well as the machinery used to make counterfeit pills, and hold drug traffickers accountable. CBP would be granted the authority to demand additional documentation and other information about de minimis packages. The change would enable customs officials to more effectively analyze risk, identify patterns of concern, and take action against those who try to abuse our system. The legislation would also add a user fee for de minimis packages to help pay for the staff and equipment needed to better identify, and seize, illicit fentanyl being shipped in small packages into our country. The Detect and Defeat Counter-Fentanyl Proposal would also result in stronger penalties that will more effectively deter synthetic drug and precursor trafficking in the de minimis environment and incentivize the private sector to self-police their supply chains for narcotics risk.\n\n\n\nDHS is continuing to build on recent successes to strengthen enforcement of U.S. textile and apparel trade laws to support U.S. textile manufacturers and workers, and continues to prioritize eliminating forced labor from U.S. supply chains, including through the enforcement of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA). In April, DHS outlined an enhanced strategy to combat illicit trade and level the playing field for the American textile industry, led by CBP and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI). In Fiscal Year 2024 through September 1, CBP has:\n\nLaunched 18 Trade Special Operations (TSOs) that focus on physical inspection of small shipments and cargo containing textile and apparel products, as well as post-release reviews to determine eligibility for preferential treatment under free trade agreements, verify classification, valuation, and right to make entry.\n\nTrade Special Operations (TSOs) that focus on physical inspection of small shipments and cargo containing textile and apparel products, as well as post-release reviews to determine eligibility for preferential treatment under free trade agreements, verify classification, valuation, and right to make entry.

In July, the interagency Forced Labor Enforcement Task Force (FLETF), with DHS as Chair, added 26 entities in the high-priority textile sector to the UFLPA Entity List, which will restrict imports of goods from these entities into the United States. DHS and the FLETF will continue to prioritize examination of entities in the textile and apparel sector for possible addition to the UFLPA Entity List, which currently includes 73 entities across a wide range of industry sectors.\n\n###",

        "text": "Pope Says Both Trump and Harris Are \u2018Against Life\u2019\nAsked his advice to Catholic voters in the coming U.S. presidential election, Pope Francis said on Friday that they must choose the \u201clesser of two evils\u201d because \u201cboth are against life\u201d \u2014 Kamala Harris for her support for abortion rights, and Donald J. Trump for closing the door to immigrants.\n\n\u201cSending migrants away, not allowing them to grow, not letting them have life is something wrong; it is cruelty,\u201d Francis said in a news conference on the plane as he returned to Rome after his long trip to Southeast Asia and Oceania. \u201cSending a child away from the womb of the mother is murder because there is life. And we must speak clearly about these things.\u201d\n\nThe remarks came as Francis, 87, concluded a grueling 11-day tour of the Asia-Pacific region that included stops in Jakarta, East Timor and Singapore, showcasing his commitment to reach out to the faithful in what he calls \u201cthe peripheries\u201d and to build a less Eurocentric church that looks to Asia.\n\nHis stance on the American presidential race reflects the divide among Catholic voters in the United States, who in previous elections have been just as split between the parties as the larger electorate. The American bishops\u2019 conference similarly advises Catholics to take the array of church teaching into account in the voting booth and does not endorse candidates \u2014 although some bishops weigh in more explicitly.",

        "text": "Pope slams both Harris and Trump as \u2018against life\u2019 and urges Catholics to vote for \u2018lesser evil\u2019\nABOARD THE PAPAL PLANE (AP) \u2014 Pope Francis on Friday slammed both U.S. presidential candidates for what he called anti-life policies on abortion and migration, and he advised American Catholics to choose who they think is the \u201clesser evil\u201d in the upcoming U.S. elections.\n\n\u201cBoth are against life, be it the one who kicks out migrants, or be it the one who kills babies,\u2033 Francis said.\n\nThe Argentine Jesuit was asked to provide counsel to American Catholic voters during an airborne news conference while he flew back to Rome from his four-nation tour through Asia. Francis stressed that he is not an American and would not be voting.\n\nNeither Republican candidate Donald Trump nor the Democratic candidate, Kamala Harris, was mentioned by name.\n\nBut Francis nevertheless expressed himself in stark terms when asked to weigh in on their positions on two hot-button issues in the U.S. election \u2014 abortion and migration \u2014 that are also of major concern to the Catholic Church.\n\nFrancis has made the plight of migrants a priority of his pontificate and speaks out emphatically and frequently about it. While strongly upholding church teaching forbidding abortion, Francis has not emphasized church doctrine as much as his predecessors.\n\nFrancis said migration is a right described in Scripture and that anyone who does not follow the Biblical call to welcome the stranger is committing a \u201cgrave sin.\u201d\n\nHe was also blunt in speaking about abortion. \u201cTo have an abortion is to kill a human being. You may like the word or not, but it\u2019s killing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to see this clearly.\u201d\n\nAsked what voters should do at the polls, Francis recalled the civic duty to vote.\n\n\u201cOne should vote, and choose the lesser evil,\u201d he said. \u201cWho is the lesser evil, the woman or man? I don\u2019t know.\n\n\u201cEveryone in their conscience should think and do it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Harris and Trump campaigns did not immediately respond to requests for comment from The Associated Press.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden, an observant Catholic, shares Harris\u2019 strong support for abortion rights, a stance that prompted some Catholic bishops and other conservatives to call for him to be denied access to Communion.\n\nAfter meeting Francis in person at the Vatican in October 2021, Biden came away saying the pope told him he was a \u201cgood Catholic\u201d and should continue receiving Communion.\n\nFrancis, asked on previous occasions about some U.S. bishops who want to deny Communion to Biden over his support for abortion rights, has said bishops should be pastors, not politicians.\n\nFriday\u2019s news conference was not the first time Francis has weighed in on a U.S. election. In the run-up to the 2016 election, Francis was asked about Trump\u2019s plan to build a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border. Francis declared then that anyone who builds a wall to keep out migrants \u201cis not Christian.\u201d\n\nIn responding Friday, Francis recalled that he celebrated Mass at the U.S.-Mexico border and \u201cthere were so many shoes of the migrants who ended up badly there.\u201d\n\nTrump pledges massive deportations, just as he did in his first White House bid, when there was a vast gulf between his ambitions and the legal, financial and political realities of such an undertaking.\n\nThe U.S. bishops conference, for its part, has called abortion the \u201cpreeminent priority\u201d for American Catholics in its published voter advice. Harris has strongly defended abortion rights and has emphasized support for reinstating a federal right to abortion.\n\nIn his comments, the pope added: \u201cOn abortion, science says that a month from conception, all the organs of a human being are already there, all of them. Performing an abortion is killing a human being. Whether you like the word or not, this is killing. You can\u2019t say the church is closed because it does not allow abortion. The church does not allow abortion because it\u2019s killing. It is murder.\u201d\n\nHowever, cells are only beginning the process of developing into organs in the earliest weeks of pregnancy. For example, cardiac tissue starts to form in the first two months \u2014 initially a tube that only later evolves into the four chambers that define a heart. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says that by 13 weeks, all major organs have formed.\n\nIn other comments, Francis:\n\n\u2014 denied a French media report that he would travel to Paris for the December inauguration of the restored Notre Dame Cathedral, saying flat-out he would not be there. But he confirmed he would like to go to the Canary Islands to highlight the plight of migrants.\n\n\u2014 tamped down renewed speculation that he might finally return to Argentina later this year, saying he wants to go but that nothing had been decided. He added: \u201cThere are various things to resolve first.\u201d Francis has not been home since before the 2013 conclave that elected him pope.\n\n\u2014 declared that China was \u201ca promise and a hope\u201d for the Catholic Church and hoped to one day visit.\n\n\u2014 called sexual abuse \u201cdemonic\u201d and weighed on the latest revelations of assault against a legendary French priest, Abbe Pierre.\n\n___\n\nAP Medical Writer Lauran Neergaard in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP\u2019s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Whether you are a first-time voter or have voted absentee in previous elections, you should complete a Federal Post Card Application (FPCA) each year to ensure you are able to participate in elections as an overseas absentee voter.\n\nIf you have already completed a FPCA in 2024, you should soon receive your blank ballot, or instructions for how to access your ballot. Please check your state\u2019s voter registration verification website, or contact your local election office, to check the status of your absentee ballot request.

        "text": "US-China Relations in the Biden-Era: A Timeline\nUS-China Relations in the Biden Era: A Timeline\n\nThis article on US-China relations was originally posted on March 22, 2021, and last updated on November 26, 2024.\n\nOn January 20, 2021, Joe Biden was sworn in as the 46th president of the United States, offering a chance to change the course of US-China relations, which had hit a low point under the outgoing Trump administration.\n\nThe four years witnessed escalating trade tensions culminating in a trade war and sanctions on Chinese technology companies.\n\nSince Biden\u2019s election, political and business stakeholders have been paying close attention to the direction of the new White House administration\u2019s policy toward China.\n\nWill the Biden administration be accommodating of China or take advantage of the new status quo established under his predecessor?\n\nChina Briefing previously monitored and documented major developments during the US-China trade war in the Trump era.\n\nHere, we present a fresh timeline that will track key developments affecting bilateral ties between the world\u2019s two largest economies under the Biden administration.\n\nUS-China relations in the Biden era\n\nNovember 22, 2024: DHS Adds 29 New Entities to the UFLPA Entity List, Bringing Total to 107\n\nOn November 22, 2024, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced the addition of 29 China-based companies to the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) Entity List, increasing the total number of entities on the list to 107.\n\nThe UFLPA serves as a key tool in the Biden-Harris administration\u2019s efforts to combat alleged forced labor.\n\nStarting November 25, 2024, U.S. Customs and Border Protection will enforce a rebuttable presumption that goods produced by these 29 entities are made with forced labor and, therefore, prohibited from entering the United States unless proven otherwise.\n\nThe 29 newly added companies include:\n\nTianjin Tianwei Food Co., Ltd.: Previously known as Tianjin Sanhe Fruit and Vegetable Co., Ltd., this company processes fruit, vegetables, and agricultural products, with a particular focus on tomato products. Located in Tianjin, China, the company integrates raw material cultivation, harvesting, production, processing, trade, and R&D.\n\nPreviously known as Tianjin Sanhe Fruit and Vegetable Co., Ltd., this company processes fruit, vegetables, and agricultural products, with a particular focus on tomato products. Located in Tianjin, China, the company integrates raw material cultivation, harvesting, production, processing, trade, and R&D. Xinjiang Zhonghe Co., Ltd. (Xinjiang Joinworld Co., Ltd.): Based in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), this company specializes in electronic materials and aluminum alloy products, including high-purity aluminum, electronic aluminum foil, electrode foil, and related products.\n\nBased in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), this company specializes in electronic materials and aluminum alloy products, including high-purity aluminum, electronic aluminum foil, electrode foil, and related products. Xinjiang Nonferrous Metals Industry Group Co., Ltd. and three of its subsidiaries: These entities are located in the XUAR and are involved in the production of nonferrous metals and gold.\n\nthree of its subsidiaries: These entities are located in the XUAR and are involved in the production of nonferrous metals and gold. 23 agricultural entities: The Forced Labor Enforcement Task Force (FLETF) has identified 23 additional entities involved in the production and sale of agricultural products such as tomato paste, walnuts, red dates, raisins, and other goods.\n\nNovember 16, 2024: Biden and Xi Meet at the APEC Summit in Lima, Peru\n\nAt the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Lima, Peru, US President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping engaged in a candid two-hour discussion on November 16, addressing key issues in US-China relations.\n\nThis marked their final meeting before Biden leaves office, as President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s administration prepares to take over in January. Topics ranged from cybercrime, Taiwan, and the South China Sea to trade, North Korea, and Russia. Xi emphasized China\u2019s commitment to maintaining stable, healthy ties with the US, acknowledging past tensions but expressing readiness to work with the Trump administration to manage differences and expand cooperation.\n\nThe talks reflected a mix of contention and cautious dialogue. On trade, Biden\u2019s policies\u2014such as investment restrictions on Chinese technology sectors\u2014were a point of friction. However, the two leaders found common ground on the importance of preventing the use of artificial intelligence in nuclear decision-making. With North Korea\u2019s role in the Ukraine conflict raising concerns, Biden urged China to leverage its influence to prevent further escalation.\n\nThe meeting, while producing no major breakthroughs, underscored the complexity of managing bilateral tensions as the US prepares for a potentially more confrontational approach under Trump.\n\nNovember 13, 2024: US Advisory Panel Recommends Repealing China\u2019s Preferential Trade Status\n\nChina\u2019s preferential trade status, a cornerstone of its economic growth, is under renewed scrutiny in the United States. The US-China Economic and Security Review Commission (USCC), a leading advisory panel on China, has recommended repealing this status. The panel argues that it allows China to enjoy favorable trade terms despite engaging in unfair trade practices. This proposal aligns with growing bipartisan support in the US Congress for adopting a tougher stance on China\u2019s economic policies.\n\nRevoking China\u2019s Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) status could result in higher tariffs on Chinese imports, with potential repercussions for US consumers and businesses. It may also escalate tensions between the two economic superpowers and further strain global supply chains. Proponents, however, contend that such a move would enhance the United States\u2019 ability to counter China\u2019s non-market practices and safeguard American industries.\n\nThe USCC\u2019s recommendation underscores the increasing complexity of US-China relations, characterized by both economic interdependence and strategic rivalry. As the two nations navigate contentious issues such as trade, technology, and security, the trajectory of their relationship remains uncertain.\n\nOctober 28, 2024: US Issues Final Rules on Investment Restrictions Against China, Chinese Ministry of Commerce Responds\n\nOn October 28, the US Treasury Department issued final rules on investment restrictions against China, targeting sectors such as semiconductors, artificial intelligence, and quantum computing. These rules aim to prevent U.S. investments from advancing technologies that could pose national security threats.\n\nSet to go into effect on January 2, 2025, the final rules provide the operative regulations for relevant stakeholders and explanatory discussion regarding their intent and application.\n\nIn response, China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce expressed strong opposition, arguing that the restrictions will disrupt normal economic and trade cooperation and harm businesses in both countries. China has lodged stern representations with the US and reserves the right to take countermeasures. The Ministry urged the US to respect market economy principles and stop politicizing economic and trade issues to foster a favorable environment for bilateral cooperation.\n\nThe restrictions have already prompted some investment firms, like Sequoia Capital and Matrix Partners, to adjust their operations in China to comply with U.S. regulations.\n\nOctober 2, 2024: DHS Adds First Steel and Aspartame Companies to UFLPA Entity List\n\nOn October 2, 2024, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced the addition of two Chinese companies to the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) Entity List, increasing the total number of listed entities to 75. Effective October 3, 2024, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) will presume that goods produced by these companies are prohibited from entering the United States unless proven otherwise.\n\nThe newly listed companies are:\n\nBaowu Group Xinjiang Bayi Iron and Steel Co., Ltd. : Based in the Urumqi Prefecture of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), this company is involved in iron ore mining and steel manufacturing, producing rebar, hot-rolled coils, and medium and thick steel plates.\n\n: Based in the Urumqi Prefecture of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), this company is involved in iron ore mining and steel manufacturing, producing rebar, hot-rolled coils, and medium and thick steel plates. Changzhou Guanghui Food Ingredients Co., Ltd. (GSweet): Headquartered in Jiangsu, China, GSweet produces and sells aspartame, an artificial sweetener and food additive.\n\nThis marks the first time that steel and aspartame companies have been added to the UFLPA Entity List, reflecting ongoing concerns about forced labor practices in these industries.\n\nOctober 2, 2024: The US Treasury adds two Chinese entities to the SDN list\n\nThe Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the U.S. Department of the Treasury has added two Chinese entities to its Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list. This action targets companies allegedly involved in facilitating weapons procurement and smuggling activities for the Houthi movement in Yemen. The entities are Shenzhen Boyu Imports and Exports Co., Ltd. and Shenzhen Jinghon Electronics Limited. Being added to the SDN list subjects them to sanctions, restricting their access to the U.S. financial system and prohibiting U.S. persons from engaging in transactions with them.\n\nDay 1333 (September 13, 2024): USTR Finalizes China Tariff Actions Following Four-Year Review, Announces Significant Increases\n\nOn September 13, 2024, the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) announced final modifications to the tariff actions under the Section 301 investigation, following a statutory four-year review. The modifications proposed in May 2024 have been largely adopted, with several updates intended to \u201cstrengthen actions to protect American businesses and workers from China\u2019s unfair trade practices.\u201d\n\nAnnex A provides a detailed table of the tariff increases across 14 product groups specified by the President, encompassing 382 subheadings and 7 statistical reporting numbers. These products are primarily in sectors targeted by China for dominance or where the U.S. has recently made significant domestic investments.\n\nEffective September 27, tariff rates will increase to 100% on Chinese electric vehicles, 50% on solar cells, and 25% on EV battery parts, critical minerals, iron and steel, aluminum, masks, and shore container cranes. Tariff increases on semiconductor chips and other products will be phased in over the next two years. The increases for 2025 and 2026 will apply to relevant products on or after January 1 of the respective year.\n\nThe statement also includes an exclusion for enteral syringes, a proposal to cover additional tungsten, wafers, and polysilicon tariff lines, an exclusion for ship-to-shore cranes ordered before May 14, 2024, an expansion of the machinery exclusions process to include five additional tariff lines, and modifications to the proposed exclusions for solar manufacturing equipment.\n\nOn September 14, a spokesperson for China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce expressed strong dissatisfaction and firm opposition to the USTR\u2019s announcement of increased tariffs on certain Chinese goods. The spokesperson noted that the majority of public comments on the tariff review opposed the increases or called for expanded exemptions, indicating that the tariffs are unpopular. The spokesperson urged the U.S. to correct its actions and cancel all additional tariffs on Chinese goods, stating that China will take necessary measures to firmly safeguard the interests of Chinese enterprises.\n\nDay 1329 to 1331 (September 9 to 11, 2024): US House of Representatives Pass Host of Anti-China Legislation During \u201cChina Week\u201d\n\nThe US House of Representatives has passed a slew of bills targeting Chinese companies and industries during its first week back in session following the summer break, dubbed \u201cChina Week\u201d. A total of 25 bills are up for deliberation.\n\nSignificant bills that have already been passed include the Biosecure Act, which codifies the Chinese biotech companies BGI, MGI, Complete Genomics, WuXi AppTec, and WuXi Biologic as \u201cforeign adversary biotechnology companies\u201d and renders them ineligible for certain federal contracts, and the Countering CCP Drones Act, which places the Chinese drone maker DJI on the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s (FCC) Covered List, thereby prohibiting any new DJI models from being approved and operating in the US.\n\nMeanwhile, the Decoupling From Foreign Adversarial Battery Dependence Act, also passed this week, forbids the US Department of Homeland Security from procuring batteries from six Chinese battery companies, namely Gotion, BYD, CATL, Envision, EVE, and Hithium.\n\nThe DHS Restrictions on Confucius Institutes and Chinese Entities of Concern Act, meanwhile, restricts funding to universities that have a relationship with a Confucius Institute.\n\nOther passed bills include:\n\nThe Countering the PRC Malign Influence Fund Authorization Act\n\nThe Science and Technology Agreement Enhanced Congressional Notification Act\n\nThe Removing our Unsecure Technologies to Ensure Reliability and Security Act\n\nThe Chinese Currency Accountability Act\n\nThe Taiwan Conflict Deterrence Act\n\nThe Foreign Adversary Communications Transparency Act\n\nThe Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office Certification Act\n\nThe Economic Espionage Prevention Act\n\nThe Sanctions Lists Harmonization Act\n\nA number of bills are yet to be deliberated and may be passed by the House later in September, including:\n\nThe Protect America\u2019s Innovation and Economic Security from CCP Act of 2024, a revival of the controversial China Initiative (scrapped in 2022), which seeks to \u201ccurb spying by the CCP on US intellectual property and academic institutions\u201d and \u201cidentify and prosecute individuals engaged in trade secret theft, hacking, and economic espionage\u201d;\n\nThe Protecting American Agriculture from Foreign Adversaries Act of 2024, which will require additional reviews of purchases of farmland by \u201cforeign adversaries\u201d, including China; and\n\nThe End Chinese Dominance of Electric Vehicles in America Act of 2024, which would exclude vehicles with batteries that contain materials sourced from foreign entities from receiving clean vehicle tax credits.\n\nThe bills that have been passed by the House will now be deliberated by the Senate before being sent to the President to be signed into law.\n\nChinese officials have strongly criticized the passing of these bills. Answering a media question on the Biosecure Act, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ning said that the bill was \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d and called on the US to \u201crespect the principles of market economy and trade rules\u201d and \u201cstop suppressing Chinese companies under various pretexts\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, the Spokesperson of the Chinese Embassy in Washington DC, speaking on the passing of the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office Certification Act, which could see the closure of Hong Kong trade offices, said that some individuals in the US were \u201csuppressing Hong Kong\u2019s development for political purposes\u201d while warning that China would take \u201cresolute and strong countermeasures\u201d should the US progress with the bill.\n\nDay 1325 (September 5, 2024): US Commerce Department Implements Export Controls for Quantum Computing and Other Advanced Technologies.\n\nThe US Department of Commerce\u2019s (DOC) Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) has issued a new interim final rule imposing export controls on quantum computing items, advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment, Gate All-Around Field-Effect Transistor (GAAFET) technology (used for high-performance computing chips) and additive manufacturing items designed to produce metal or metal alloy components.\n\nAccording to the DOC, the export controls, which came into effect on September 6, 2024, seek to ensure these items are not used for purposes contrary to U.S. national security or foreign policy\u201d, as they could be used for military purposes. The controls apply to all countries, with exceptions provided for exports and reexport to countries that have themselves implemented export controls on these items.\n\nWhile the rule applies worldwide and does not explicitly mention China, exports or reexports of these items to China (and other countries) will require a license, with the license application to be reviewed \u201cwith a presumption of denial\u201d. Meanwhile, exports and reexports to countries that impose export controls on conventional arms and dual-use goods and technologies (specifically, the Wassenaar Arrangement Participating States) will have their licenses reviewed with \u201ca presumption of approval\u201d.\n\nThis move is the latest in a long list of efforts made by the Biden administration to curb the exports of high-end and advanced technologies to China.\n\nDay 1324 to 1326 (September 4 \u2013 6, 2024): US Climate Envoy John Podesta Visits Beijing for US-China Climate Talks.\n\nThe US Senior Advisor to the President for International Climate Policy John Podesta met with China\u2019s Special Envoy for Climate Change Liu Zhenmin in Beijing for the second US-China Working Group on Enhancing Climate Action in the 2020s.\n\nAccording to a readout from the US State Department, the two sides reaffirmed their intention to hold a Methane and Other Non-CO2 Greenhouse Gases Summit at COP 29, which will be held in November, along with the COP 29 hosts Azerbaijan.\n\nIn addition, the two sides also reconfirmed collaboration on efforts to ban illegal imports as part of their commitment order to advance efforts to halt and reverse forest loss by 2030, as well as promote global forest conservation and sustainable management.\n\nOn September 6, Podesta also met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi. Per a meeting readout from the State Council, Wang championed bilateral engagement on climate change, stating that it is \u201cnot only an integral part of bilateral relations, but also an important measure to implement the consensus reached by the two heads of state\u201d during their meeting in San Francisco in November 2023.\n\nPodesta reportedly also stated that the US was willing to further \u201cstrengthen communication and coordination with China and engage in constructive cooperation\u201d.\n\nDay 1316 to 1318 (August 27 to 29, 2024): US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan Meets with President Xi Jinping and Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Beijing.\n\nOn August 29, 2024, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met with President Xi Jinping in Beijing in the first visit by a US national security advisor to China in eight years as part of ongoing efforts to increase bilateral engagement. According to a White House readout, the meeting focused on implementing commitments made during the November 2023 Woodside Summit, including counter-narcotics, military-to-military communications, AI safety, cross-strait relations, the Russia-Ukraine war, and the South China Sea.\n\nAccording to the readout from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA), Xi Jinping highlighted the need for global cooperation amid a turbulent international landscape, urging unity over division. He called for the US to work with China and for the two countries to \u201cregard each other\u2019s development as an opportunity rather than a challenge\u201d, \u201cto coexist peacefully and [\u2026] promote the stability of China-US relations\u201d.\n\nThe MOFA readout also stated that Sullivan reiterated the US\u2019s position on non-confrontation with China, stating that \u201cthe United States does not seek to fight a \u201cnew Cold War\u201d, does not seek to change the Chinese system, does not seek to oppose China by strengthening the alliance system, does not support \u201cTaiwan independence\u201d, and has no intention of conflict with China.\u201d\n\nEarlier on August 27 and 28, Sullivan met with the Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi for discussions described as \u201ccandid, substantive, and constructive\u201d. The meeting confirmed a series of upcoming exchanges between US and Chinese officials, including:\n\nA leader-level call \u201cin the coming weeks\u201d;\n\nA theater commander telephone call \u201cin the near future\u201d;\n\nA visit by Senior Advisor to the President for International Climate Policy John Podesta to China in the first week of September\n\nThe two sides also discussed cooperation in reducing the flow of illicit synthetic drugs, the repatriation of undocumented migrants, and law enforcement, as well as steps to tackle the climate crisis.\n\nHowever, Sullivan reiterated that the US would continue to take measures against what it perceives as \u201cunfair trade policies and non-market economic practices, emphasizing that \u201cthe United States will continue to take necessary actions to prevent advanced US technologies from being used to undermine our national security, without unduly limiting trade or investment\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, according to the MOFA readout, Wang Yi stated that the US \u201cshould stop suppressing China in the fields of economy, trade and science and technology, and stop undermining China\u2019s legitimate interests\u201d, while also criticizing the US\u2019s use of \u201c\u2018overcapacity\u2019 as an excuse to engage in protectionism\u201d.\n\nWang Yi outlined five key principles to \u201cfind the right way for the two major countries of China and the United States to get along.\u201d These are, broadly:\n\nFollowing the guidance of the two heads of state, who should \u201cuphold the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation\u201d; Avoiding conflict and confrontation by abiding by the three joint communiqu\u00e9s, wherein diplomatic relations are based on \u201crespect for China\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity, respect China\u2019s political system and development path, and respect for the legitimate development rights of the Chinese people\u201d; Basing US-China interactions on equal treatment, in which bilateral interactions are not based on positions of strength; Increasing people-to-people exchanges; and \u201cEstablishing correct cognition\u201d, wherein the US recognizes China\u2019s commitment to enabling the Chinese people to live a better life domestically and make greater contributions to world peace and development internationally.\n\nThe two sides also discussed various foreign policy and national security matters, such as the Russia-Ukraine war, cross-Strait relations, the South China Sea, the Korean Peninsula, and the Middle East.\n\nDay 1308 (August 19, 2024): US and China Agree to Strengthen Cooperation on Financial Stability.\n\nSenior officials from the US Department of the Treasury and the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) convened in Shanghai for the fifth meeting of the Financial Working Group (FWG) on August 15-16, 2024. The FWG, established by US Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in September 2023, is a key forum for ongoing financial dialogue between the two nations.\n\nAccording to the PBOC readout, the PBOC and the Treasury signed an exchange of notes aimed at strengthening China-US financial stability cooperation. This agreement included the exchange of lists of financial stability contacts. The initiative is designed to ensure that both nations\u2019 financial management departments can maintain timely and smooth communication channels, particularly during events of financial stress or when operational risks at financial institutions arise, thereby reducing uncertainty.\n\nBesides this agreement, discussions during the two-day meeting were described by the PCOC as \u201cprofessional, pragmatic, frank, and constructive,\u201d covering a wide range of topics including macroeconomic and financial stability, international financial institutions, cross-border payments and data, and capital markets. Both sides reviewed the outcomes of technical exchanges held earlier in the year, which focused on central bank climate scenario testing, operational resilience in the financial sector, and the resolution of Global Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs). The Joint Treasury-PBOC Cooperation and Exchange on Anti-Money Laundering (AML), which had met in-person for the second time, discussed beneficial ownership and potential revisions to China\u2019s AML laws.\n\nAccording to the Treasury readout, the meeting also included a roundtable that brought together private firms from both countries to exchange views on climate financing, including transition planning and carbon markets.\n\nDay 1289 (July 31, 2024): China Imposes Export Controls on Drones with Potential Dual Military Use\n\nThe Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM), the General Administration of Customs, and the Central Military Commission\u2019s Equipment Development Department have announced new export controls on drones and their key components, with the measures set to take effect on September 1, 2024.\n\nThe new regulations stipulate that the export of certain unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and related items will require prior authorization. Specifically, the controls target items that meet the following criteria:\n\nAviation Engines: Specialized for specific UAVs or unmanned airships with a maximum sustained power exceeding 16 kW. Payload Equipment: Includes infrared imaging devices, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), target-designating lasers, and inertial measurement units that meet certain technical standards. Communication Equipment: Radio communication devices with long-distance transmission capabilities or multi-drone control capacity. Anti-Drone Systems: Civilian systems designed to disrupt or destroy drones.\n\nExporters will be required to apply for licenses through provincial commerce departments and submit detailed documentation, including contracts, technical descriptions, end-user and end-use certificates, and identification of key personnel. The Ministry of Commerce, in conjunction with relevant departments, will review applications and issue export licenses.\n\nThe announcement also stresses that all UAVs not explicitly listed but known or suspected to be used for mass destruction, terrorism, or military purposes may also not be exported. Exporters found to violate this requirement may be held criminally liable.\n\nAccording to a MOFCOM spokesperson, the primary aim of the export controls is to enhance national security by ensuring that advanced technology does not fall into the hands of adversaries or entities that could use it against China\u2019s interests. The measures also align with China\u2019s international obligations to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and to combat terrorism. By controlling the export of sophisticated drone technology, China aims to comply with international non-proliferation agreements and restrict the use of such technology for harmful purposes.\n\nHowever, the MOFCOM spokesperson also stated that China \u201copposes individual countries\u2019 arbitrary use of drones as an excuse to impose illegal sanctions on Chinese companies and individuals\u201d. This is likely in reference to the US, which has imposed export controls on various Chinese goods due to their purported dual military use.\n\nIn June, the US House of Representatives passed the National Defense Authorization Act for the year 2025 (FY25 NDAA), which includes the Countering CCP Drones Act. Among other things, this Act will require the inclusion of telecommunications and video surveillance equipment or services produced by the Chinese drone company DJI on a list of communications equipment or services that are \u201cunacceptable risk to U.S. national security\u201d. This would prohibit the use of federal funding to purchase or maintain any of the listed DJI equipment or services. This Act will have to be passed by the Senate before being signed into law by President Joe Biden.\n\nAnother version of the Act, called the Countering CCP 3 Drones and Supporting Drones for Law Enforcement Act, has also been introduced as an amendment to the FY25 NDAA by two senators, which also includes Autel Robotics, another Chinese drone maker.\n\nDay 1285 (July 27, 2024): US Secretary of State Meets Chinese Foreign Minister in Vientiane\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on the sidelines of the ASEAN-related ministerial meetings in Vientiane, Laos. The discussions, described as open and productive, covered key bilateral, regional, and global issues.\n\nAccording to the US Department of State readout, Secretary Blinken emphasized the importance of using diplomacy to responsibly manage competition and to address areas of difference while seeking cooperation on matters significant to the American people and the world. Blinken highlighted recent steps taken by China to advance counternarcotics cooperation and enhance military-to-military communication to prevent conflict. He reiterated the US commitment to safeguarding interests and values, including human rights, and stressed the priority of resolving cases of American citizens wrongfully detained or subject to exit bans in China.\n\nThe Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs readout noted that the meeting occurred at Blinken\u2019s request and that both sides agreed to maintain communication and further implement the understandings reached by Presidents Joe Biden and Xi Jinping at the San Francisco meeting in November 2023. Wang Yi pointed out that while communication between the two governments has increased, the US has continued its containment and suppression of China, leading to rising risks and challenges in the bilateral relationship.\n\nWang Yi reiterated China\u2019s consistent policy of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation, urging the US to implement Biden\u2019s commitments and adopt a rational and pragmatic policy towards China. He emphasized that China does not seek hegemony and is committed to peaceful development and the well-being of the Chinese people.\n\nBoth sides also exchanged views on Taiwan and discussed the situations in the South China Sea, Ukraine, Gaza, the Korean Peninsula, and Myanmar, among other issues, and recognized the importance of maintaining open lines of communication in the coming weeks and months.\n\nDay 1273 (July 15, 2024): China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce Requests WTO to Begin Dispute Negotiation on US Subsidies on Electric Vehicles.\n\nChina\u2019s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) has requested the World Trade Organization (WTO) to set up an expert group to investigate measures such as subsidies for new energy vehicles (NEVs) provided by the US under Biden\u2019s flagship Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).\n\nAccording to MOFCOM, the IRA \u201cuses products from specific regions such as the US as a subsidy premise, excludes products from WTO members such as China, artificially sets up trade barriers, and pushes up the cost of energy green transformation.\u201d It also called the measures \u201cdiscriminatory, protectionist\u201d, and in violation of WTO rules.\n\nOn March 26, 2024, China raised the matter of NEV subsidies under the IRA to the WTO through its dispute resolution mechanism. However, negotiations between China and the US failed to reach a solution, leading China to advance the litigation process with the WTO.\n\nA core part of the IRA, which was signed into law in 2022, is to boost investment and development of green industries in the US by providing a range of subsidies, incentives, and tax credits to green industries, including domestic EV manufacturing. In May 2024, the US raised tariffs on Chinese EV imports from 25 percent to 100 percent, citing the domestic development of the industry as a motivator for the hike.\n\nChina is currently the world\u2019s top EV manufacturer, but Chinese companies\u2019 market penetration in the US remains low compared to other regions.\n\nDay 1,249 (June 21, 2024): US Treasury Issues Draft Regulations Restricting US Investment in Sensitive Technology Sectors in China.\n\nThe US Treasury has issued a proposed rule that would ban or screen American investments in China\u2019s semiconductors and microelectronics, quantum information technologies, and artificial intelligence sectors. This is part of President Biden\u2019s aim to \u201cprevent the exploitation of U.S. outbound investments by [China] seeking to develop sensitive technologies or products that are critical to the next generation of military, intelligence, surveillance, or cyber-enabled capabilities that pose national security risks to the United States\u201d.\n\nThe proposed rule follows an executive order made by Biden in August 2023 to the Treasury Secretary to issue regulations requiring Americans to provide information on certain transactions or prohibit them from engaging in certain transactions with Chinese companies and individuals.\n\nThe draft regulations apply to the Chinese mainland and the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macao. The regulations will work by:\n\nProhibiting American individuals and companies from engaging in certain transactions involving the identified technology sectors that pose a particularly acute national security threat to the United States; and Requiring American individuals and companies to notify the Treasury of certain other transactions involving these technology sectors that may contribute to the threat to the national security of the United States.\n\nThe Treasury is soliciting public feedback on the proposed rule until August 4, 2024.\n\nDay 1,228 (May 31, 2024): Chinese and US Defense Ministers Meet for Talks in Singapore\n\nThe US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin met with the Chinese Minister of National Defense Admiral Dong Jun at the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue defense summit in Singapore to discuss US-China defense relations and global security issues. This is the first face-to-face meeting between the countries\u2019 military commanders since 2022 and follows a video conference call between the Secretary and the Admiral on April 16.\n\nPer a readout from the US Department of Defense, the US side reaffirmed commitments to maintain open lines of military-to-military communication, resuming telephone conversations between theater commanders \u201cin the coming months\u201d, and plans to convene a crisis-communications working group by the end of the year.\n\nAdditionally, Secretary Austin raised concerns over stability across the Taiwan Strait but reaffirmed the US\u2019s commitment to the One China Policy. However, he also \u201cmade clear that the United States will continue to fly, sail, and operate \u2014 safely and responsibly \u2014 wherever international law allows\u201d, and that freedom of navigation under international law should continue to be respected. This is in reference to military drills that the US has carried out with allies in the South China Sea, a disputed territory.\n\nMeanwhile, a readout from the Chinese Ministry of Defense echoed the US side\u2019s calls for continued communication, stating that \u201cthe two militaries should adhere to the bottom line of non-conflict and non-confrontation\u201d and that \u201cthe purpose of communication between the two militaries is to enhance understanding, eliminate misunderstandings and accumulate mutual trust.\u201d\n\nAdmiral Dong also reiterated China\u2019s stance on the Taiwan issue and stated that China opposes the US\u2019s \u201cacts that intensify provocations\u201d, specifically citing activity surrounding Ren\u2019ai Reef \u2013 also known as the Second Thomas Shoal \u2013 in the South China Sea.\n\nDay 1,227 (May 30, 2024): China Customs to Impose Export Restrictions on Dual Use Aviation and Aerospace Technologies from July 1.\n\nChina\u2019s General Administration of Customs has announced new export restrictions on four types of military-related equipment and technology. The export restrictions target products with potential dual military and civilian use and will be imposed to \u201cfulfill international obligations such as non-proliferation\u201d from July 1, 2024.\n\nFour product categories will be subject to the restrictions:\n\nAerospace structural parts and engine manufacturing-related equipment, software, and technology. Equipment, software, and technology related to gas turbine engine/gas turbine manufacturing. Equipment, software, and technology related to space suit visors. Items related to ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene fibers.\n\nCompanies wishing to export goods that fall under these categories will be required to undergo export licensing procedures, which include filling in an export application form for dual-use items and technologies.\n\nThe export restrictions do not target any specific country or region, according to the State Council. They are not expected to impact Western companies but will make it harder for military products to be exported from China to countries such as Russia, Ukraine, and Israel. They may also serve to protect Chinese companies from US sanctions for supplying technologies and materials with potential military use to Russia.\n\nDay 1,219 (May 22, 2024): US Trade Representative Proposes to Implement Raised Tariffs on Chinese Imports From August 1, 2024.\n\nThe Office of the US Trade Representative (USTR) has released a federal notice proposing that some of the tariff modifications on Chinese imports be implemented from August 1, 2024.\n\nThe notice also proposes implementing 19 temporary exclusions for certain solar manufacturing equipment and released details on an exclusion process that allows companies to request for certain equipment used for domestic manufacturing to be excluded from the Section 301 tariffs. If granted, these exclusions would be effective until May 31, 2025\n\nThe USTR is soliciting public feedback on the tariff modifications and exclusion process from May 29, 2024, to June 28, 2024.\n\nAccording to the notice, the tariff modifications set to come into effect in 2024 will do so on August 1, 2024, while those set to come into effect in 2025 and 2026 will do so on January 1 of the respective year.\n\nAs such, the tariffs will go into effect on these dates are as follows:\n\nAugust 1, 2024: Tariff modifications on battery parts, electric vehicles, li-ion electrical vehicle batteries, other critical minerals, ship-to-shore cranes, solar cells, steel and aluminum products, syringes and needles, and facemasks will come into effect.\n\nJanuary 1, 2025: Tariff modifications on semiconductors will come into effect.\n\nJanuary 1, 2026: Tariff modifications on medical gloves, li-ion non-electrical vehicle batteries, natural graphite, and permanent magnets will come into effect.\n\nDay 1,216 (May 19, 2024): China\u2019s Commerce Ministry Launches Anti-Dumping Probe into Chemical Imports from the US, EU, Japan, and Taiwan.\n\nChina\u2019s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) has announced it will launch an anti-dumping investigation into imported polyformaldehyde (POM) copolymer originating in the EU, the US, Taiwan, and Japan. The investigation has been launched upon the request of several Chinese chemical companies, according to the MOFCOM announcement.\n\nPOM is used for the production of a wide range of products, including auto parts, electronic appliances, industrial machinery, sports equipment, medical equipment, pipe fittings, and construction materials.\n\nThis investigation will start on May 19, 2024, and be completed before May 19, 2025, with the possibility of a six-month extension.\n\nThis move by MOFCOM is widely seen as a retaliatory measure to export controls and anti-dumping measures imposed by the US, the EU, and other countries. Last week, the US announced increases in tariffs on 14 categories of Chinese imports. Meanwhile, the EU has launched several anti-subsidy probes into Chinese imports, including electric vehicles, wind turbines, solar panels, and some steel products. In April, Japan stated it was considering expanding export restrictions on key semiconductor technology.\n\nFollowing the US announcement on the tariff hikes, China warned the US that it will take \u201cresolute measures to defend its rights and interests\u201d, per a statement from MOFCOM.\n\nIn April, China passed its new Tariff Law, which for the first time codifies rules on the imposition of anti-dumping and other counter-tariffs on imports.\n\nDay 1,211 (May 14, 2024): US Set to Increase Tariffs on Chinese EVs, Solar Panels, Semiconductors, and More Following Review of Section 301 Tariffs.\n\nThe US is proposing to increase tariffs on 14 Chinese goods, targeting renewable technologies, semiconductors, and healthcare products in particular. They include imposing a 100 percent tariff on Chinese electric vehicles (EVs) in 2024, up from the current 25 percent.\n\nIn a statement issued today, the US Trade Representative (USTR) Katherine Tai said that \u201cfurther action\u201d was needed to counter what it says are unfair trade practices by China in addition to the existing Section 301 Tariffs.\n\nThe review claims to have found that the Section 301 tariffs have been \u201ceffective in encouraging the PRC to take steps toward eliminating some of its technology transfer-related acts, policies, and practices\u201d while reducing exposure to US individuals and businesses to these actions. It also found that the tariffs have had a \u201csmall negative impact\u201d on the US economy, while they have positively impacted production in 10 sectors most directly affected by the tariffs.\n\nHowever, since China continues to impose policies related to technology transfer, according to the review, further action is needed to counteract them.\n\nThe recommendation by the USTR comes at the conclusion of a statutory review of the Section 301 Tariffs, which were first imposed by the Trump Administration in 2018. The USTR launched the statutory review in May 2022 in the lead-up to the four-year anniversary of the tariffs being implemented.\n\nAt the time, the Biden Administration suggested that the US may lift some tariffs on Chinese goods to fight inflation. The fact that it has now instead chosen to increase tariffs reflects how the trade relationship between China and the US has evolved in the last two years despite improvements in diplomatic dialogue, as well as the increasingly elevated position of renewables and high-end technologies as a consideration in national security.\n\nThe proposed tariff increases are as follows:\n\nBattery parts (non-lithium-ion batteries): Increase rate to 25 percent in 2024\n\nElectric vehicles: Increase rate to 100 percent in 2024\n\nFacemasks: Increase rate to 25 percent in 2024\n\nLithium-ion electrical vehicle batteries: Increase rate to 25 percent in 2024\n\nLithium-ion non-electrical vehicle batteries: Increase rate to 25 percent in 2026\n\nMedical gloves: Increase rate to 25 percent in 2026\n\nNatural graphite: Increase rate to 25 percent in 2026\n\nOther critical minerals: Increase rate to 25 percent in 2024\n\nPermanent magnets: Increase rate to 25 percent in 2026\n\nSemiconductors: Increase rate to 50 percent in 2025\n\nShip-to-shore cranes: Increase rate to 25 percent in 2024\n\nSolar cells (whether or not assembled into modules): Increase rate to 50 percent in 2024\n\nSteel and aluminum products: Increase rate to 25 percent in 2024\n\nSyringes and needles: Increase rate to 50 percent in 2024\n\nIn addition to the tariff rises, the USTR also recommends establishing an \u201cexclusion process\u201d for machinery used in domestic manufacturing, targeting in particular solar manufacturing equipment.\n\nIn a regular press briefing, Chinese Foreign Spokesperson Wang Wenbin stated that \u201cChina opposes the unilateral imposition of tariffs which violate (World Trade Organization) rules, and will take all necessary actions to protect its legitimate rights\u201d, according to CNN.\n\nDay 1191 to 1193 (April 24 to 26, 2024): Secretary of State Antony Blinken meets with President Xi Jinping and other senior Chinese officials in Beijing.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken has met with President Xi Jinping, Foreign Minister Wang Yi, and Minister of Public Security Wang Xiaohong during a three-day visit to China, holding \u201cin-depth, substantive, and constructive discussions\u201d.\n\nIn remarks made prior to their meeting, Xi acknowledged the 45th anniversary of US-China diplomatic relations and called for \u201cmutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and willing cooperation to be the three overarching principles\u201d.\n\nIn his meeting with Foreign Minister Wang Yi, Blinken discussed areas in which the two sides have advanced cooperation since the meeting between Presidents Biden and Xi in San Francisco last November, including \u201ccounternarcotics, military-to-military communication, talks on artificial intelligence risks and safety, and facilitating people-to-people exchanges\u201d, per a readout from the US Department of State. The secretary also raised concerns over China\u2019s support for Russia\u2019s \u201cdefense industrial base\u201d, cross-strait relations, and stability in the South China Sea, as well as issues in the Middle East and the Korean Peninsula.\n\nMeanwhile, according to the readout from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Wang once again reiterated that Taiwan is a \u201cred line\u201d issue for China and that the US should continue to abide by the one-China principle and the three joint China-US communiqu\u00e9s. He also called on the US to \u201cstop arming Taiwan and support China\u2019s peaceful reunification\u201d.\n\nIn his meeting with Wang Xiaohong, the two reviewed commitments made by the two sides to collaborate on counter-narcotics efforts, in particular the disruption of the trade and manufacturing of synthetic drugs such as fentanyl, one of the breakthroughs made during the Xi-Biden meeting in November.\n\nDuring his meetings with the officials, Blinken also raised concerns over the fair treatment of American companies in China and the global economic consequences of China\u2019s \u201cindustrial overcapacity\u201d. He also reiterated that the US will continue to prevent \u201cadvanced US technologies from being used to undermine our national security and economy without unduly limiting trade or investment\u201d, in reference to the US\u2019 export restrictions on various types of advanced technologies to China.\n\nDay 1191 (April 24, 2024): Joe Biden Signs Bill that will Force ByteDance to Divest from TikTok Following Senate Approval.\n\nUS President Joe Biden has signed into law a bill that will give TikTok\u2019s parent company ByteDance 270 days to divest from the social media application or face a nationwide ban in the US. The US Senate passed the bill with a vote of 79 in favor to 18 against on Tuesday, April 23.\n\nThe TikTok divestment bill, officially titled the Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, was bundled into a larger foreign aid bill (H.R.815) that will see the US provide US$95 billion in aid to Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan.\n\nByteDance will have 165 days to challenge the legislation. A 90-day extension may also be given on the deadline if it can show that it has made progress in divesting from the application.\n\nOn April 19, Apple reportedly removed Meta platforms WhatsApp and Threads from its App Store in China following an order from Beijing. The foreign-owned messaging apps Telegram and Signal have reportedly also been removed from the App Store.\n\nDay 1186 (April 19, 2024): China\u2019s MOFCOM implements 43.5% anti-dumping tariff on US propionic acid imports.\n\nChina\u2019s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) announced temporary anti-dumping measures on propionic acid (PA) imports from the US, effective April 20, 2024. US companies importing PA will be required to provide tariff deposits at a rate of 43.5 percent to China Customs.\n\nThe decision follows an investigation launched by MOFCOM in July 2023 into imported PA originating in the US, per the announcement. The investigation found that dumping of this product was occurring, and that as a result \u201cthe domestic propionic acid industry had been substantially damaged, and that there was a causal relationship between the dumping and the substantial damage.\u201d\n\nPA is an important chemical product used widely in the production of food, animal feed, pesticides, and medicine, among other fields. However, MOFCOM\u2019s new tariff is seen as largely symbolic given the relatively low volume of PA imported from the US. The move also comes after the US has stepped up rhetoric on what it says are unfair trade practices by China, threatening to increase tariffs targeting China\u2019s steel, aluminum, and solar industries.\n\nDay 1184 (April 17, 2024): Biden administration calls for tripling tariff rate on Chinese steel and aluminum imports.\n\nThe Biden administration has called on the US Trade Representative (USTR) to investigate what it calls \u201cChina\u2019s unfair shipbuilding practices\u201d and consider tripling tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum imports from the current average rate of 7.5 percent.\n\nThe comments made by Biden follow an announcement from the USTR that it will launch a Section 301 investigation into China\u2019s shipbuilding industry, specifically focusing on \u201cacts, policies, and practices of [China] targeting the maritime, logistics, and shipbuilding sectors for dominance.\u201d\n\nThe Biden administration argues that China\u2019s subsidies and incentives to the domestic steel and aluminum industry artificially lower the prices of Chinese products, thereby undercutting US producers.\n\nIn addition to increasing the tariffs, the Biden administration has also vowed to take action against countries and importers that seek to circumvent the rules and avoid tariffs. It also said it would work with Mexico to prevent China and other countries from evading tariffs by importing products through Mexico.\n\nOn the same day, Reuters reported that the Biden administration is considering granting a request from a South Korean solar panel manufacturer to overturn an exemption that allows certain solar panel technology to be imported into the US from China and other countries without paying tariffs.\n\nIn a regular press conference on April 19, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Lin Jian stated that Biden\u2019s comments on Chinese steel dumping in the US are \u201cfar-fetched\u201d and that \u201cthey hurt China-US trade ties\u201d. He also stated that China\u2019s industry focuses primarily on the domestic market, with only 5 percent of goods being exported, and that it receives no export-oriented subsidies.\n\nMeanwhile, the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT), China\u2019s trade promotion body, announced it will organize legal defenses for companies in the industry and participate in the US hearings \u201cto effectively safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies\u201d.\n\nDay 1173 (April 6, 2024): Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen Announces New US-China Initiatives to Tackle Macroeconomic Imbalances and International Crime.\n\nUS Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen announced two new initiatives following meetings with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in Guangzhou on April 5 and 6. Yellen is visiting China from April 4 to 9.\n\nThe two initiatives are as follows:\n\nTo hold \u201cintensive\u201d bilateral exchanges on balanced growth in the domestic and global economies to facilitate a discussion around macroeconomic imbalances, including their connection to overcapacity. According to Yellen, this will address US concerns \u201cabout the impact of Chinese industrial overcapacity in certain sectors as a result of government support, and the impact it could have on the American economy\u201d. To hold \u201cJoint US Treasury-PBOC Cooperation and Exchange on Anti-Money Laundering\u201d, which will seek to \u201cexpand cooperation against illicit finance and financial crime\u201d. This exchange will aim to tackle international crime organizations, in particular those involved in fraud and drug trafficking, and to prevent them from exploiting loopholes in the US and Chinese financial systems.

According to the White House readout, the discussion sought to advance on progress made in the previous meeting, in particular in areas such as \u201ccounternarcotics cooperation, ongoing military-to-military communication, talks to address AI-related risks, and continuing efforts on climate change and people-to-people exchanges\u201d.\n\nBiden also reiterated the US\u2019 concerns about China\u2019s \u201cunfair trade policies and non-market economic practices\u201d, and stated that the US \u201cwill continue to take necessary actions to prevent advanced US technologies from being used to undermine our national security, without unduly limiting trade and investment.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, according to the readout from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Xi outlined three overarching principles to guide US-China relations in 2024: Valuing peace and refraining from conflict and confrontation, prioritizing stability and refraining from setting the relationship back by provocation or \u201ccrossing the line\u201d, and upholding credibility by honoring commitments to each other with action.\n\nThe two also discussed various global geo-political issues, including Taiwan, the Russia-Ukraine war, the Korean peninsula, and the South China Sea.\n\nThe US Department of the Treasury confirmed that Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen will visit China from April 3 to 9, while the Chinese Foreign Ministry stated that US Secretary of State Antony Blinken will visit China \u201cshortly\u201d.\n\nDay 1149 (March 13, 2024): US House of Representatives Passes Bill to Ban TikTok\n\nThe US House of Representatives has voted to pass a Bill that would force ByteDance to divest from TikTok or be banned from operating in the US. The Bill passed with a vote of 352 in favor to 65 against.\n\nThe Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, as the Bill is titled, would make it illegal for companies to distribute, maintain, update, or enable the distribution, maintenance, or updating of a \u201cforeign adversary controlled\u201d application within US territory. This would effectively ban application platforms such as App Store and Google Play, as well as network providers, from hosting the TikTok application in the US.\n\nByteDance will have a period of 165 days from the bill taking effect to either sell the US portion of the business or mount a legal dispute.\n\nThe bill must be passed by the Senate before being signed into law by President Joe Biden, who has previously stated that he will do so if it is passed by Congress. Uncertainty remains surrounding whether the Senate will pass the bill, as there is more disagreement regarding how to handle issues surrounding social media platforms. Additionally, senators, the Biden Administration may come under pressure from younger voters to abandon backing the bill.\n\nDay 1143 (March 7, 2024): US House of Representatives Committee Pass Bill Requiring TikTok Divestment.\n\nThe Energy and Commerce Committee, a standing committee under the US House of Representatives, has unanimously passed a Bill that would require ByteDance, the Chinese owner of short video platform TikTok, to divest from the platform within six months.\n\nThe Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, as the Bill is titled, would make it illegal for companies to distribute, maintain, update, or enable the distribution, maintenance, or updating of a \u201cforeign adversary controlled\u201d application within US territory. This would effectively ban application platforms such as App Store and Google Play, as well as network providers, from hosting the TikTok application in the US.\n\nHowever, the application can continue to be distributed if the \u201cforeign adversary\u201d divests from the application within 165 days of the Bill taking effect.\n\nThe Bill will now go to the House of Representatives for a vote in the coming week. President Biden has previously stated that he will sign the Bill if it is passed by Congress.\n\nDay 1138 (March 2, 2024): US Commerce Department Adds 28 Chinese Companies to Entity List.\n\nThe Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) under the US Department of Commerce has issued a new rule adding 37 entities to its so-called \u201cEntity List\u201d, which subjects companies to export controls and additional licensing requirements.

Both sides stated that the two heads of state will \u201cmaintain regular contact\u201d, and committed to promoting further exchanges in strategic areas, including diplomacy, military, economy, finance, business, and climate change.\n\nDay 1095 (January 19, 2024): China and the US Hold the Third Meeting of the Financial Working Group.\n\nSenior US and Chinese officials met in Beijing for the third Financial Working Group (FWG) meeting from January 18 to 19, the first of these meetings to be held in China.

US officials expressed concerns about China\u2019s lack of communication, citing provocative behavior and a rise in risky intercepts of US aircraft by China. The talks aimed to reduce misunderstandings and improve military dialogue.\n\nThe discussions also covered combating illicit drug activities and addressing risks associated with advanced artificial intelligence systems. While the talks were considered an important step, there is acknowledgment of the ongoing work needed to establish reliable communication channels between US and Chinese military leaders.\n\nThe last high-level talks between the US and China occurred in July 2022. President Biden reportedly secured China\u2019s agreement to resume military-to-military talks during his meeting with President Xi Jinping in November.\n\nDay 1045 (November 30, 2023): Montana\u2019s Bill Banning TikTok Suspended On First Amendment Grounds.\n\nMontana\u2019s TikTok ban, which was due to take effect on January 1, 2024, has been suspended by a federal judge in a preliminary injunction following a lawsuit filed by TikTok Inc. and a group of TikTok users. TikTok\u2019s ultimate parent company is the Chinese company ByteDance.\n\nSenate Bill 419 was signed into law by Montana Governor Greg Gianforte in May of this year. The law made it illegal for mobile app stores, such as Apple\u2019s App Store and Google Play, to host TikTok on their platforms. This was the first such bill passed into law by a US state, although the app had already been banned on government devices.\n\nIn the suit, TikTok argued that the bill \u201cinfringes on its First Amendment right to make editorial choices over content curation\u201d, while the users argued that \u201ctheir right to speak on the platform is limited by [the bill]\u201d. In its conclusion, the preliminary injunction found that the bill \u201climits constitutionally protected First Amendment speech\u201d, and that it \u201coversteps state power and infringes on the Constitutional rights of users and businesses\u201d.\n\nIn addition, the preliminary injunction found that the bill failed on the grounds of \u201cforeign affairs field preemption\u201d, as \u201cDespite the State\u2019s attempt to defend SB 419 as a consumer protection bill, the current record leaves little doubt that Montana\u2019s legislature and Attorney General were more interested in targeting China\u2019s ostensible role in TikTok than with protecting Montana consumers.\u201d As foreign affairs falls exclusively under the purview of the national government in the US Constitution, the bill exceeds the State of Montana\u2019s powers on these grounds.\n\nThe preliminary injunction does not mean that the bill has been struck down, merely that further deliberation will be required and that the bill is prevented from coming into effect on January 1. The State of Montana will have to prove its case on consumer rights grounds for the bill to come into force.\n\nDay 1030 (November 15, 2023): Xi and Biden Meet in San Francisco, Agree to Further Cooperation in Key Areas.\n\nOn November 15, 2023, Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Joe Biden held their first face-to-face meeting in a year at the Filoli Estate in San Francisco. This is only the second time the two leaders have met during Biden\u2019s term as president, although the two have previously met several times in other official capacities.\n\nIn remarks given ahead of the four-hour meeting, held on the sidelines of the APEC Summit, both leaders emphasized the importance of the bilateral relationship, with Xi calling it \u201cthe most important bilateral relationship in the world\u201d.\n\nAccording to Biden, the meeting was \u201camong the most constructive and productive we\u2019ve had\u201d, and resulted in the establishment of several areas of cooperation, including artificial intelligence governance, counternarcotics, and defense, as well as commitments to improving transport links and expanding educational and cultural exchanges between the two countries.\n\nFor a full summary of the meeting, see our article: Xi-Biden Meeting: \u201cProductive\u201d Talks Lead to Increased Cooperation in Key Areas.\n\nDay 1029 (November 14, 2023): US and China Reach Several Agreements on Climate Cooperation Following Meeting Between Envoys.\n\nThe US and China have agreed to ramp up cooperation on climate action, following meetings last week between climate envoys Xie Zhenhua and John Kerry in California.\n\nA joint statement released by the Chinese Ministry of Ecology and Environment (MEE) and the US Department of State, respectively, outlines 25 points of agreement on jointly tackling the climate crisis. These include joint commitments to implement the Paris Agreement, triple renewable energy capacity globally by 2030, implement respective national methane action plans, implement technologies and measures to control greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and air pollutants, and support climate cooperation between states, provinces, and cities in each country.\n\nThe statement also agreed on the intended contents of the decision on the first Global Stocktake, which will take place at COP28 at the end of November in Dubai. The Global Stocktake is a quinquennial assessment of the progress made on climate change action since the 2015 Paris Agreement.\n\nThe two sides stated that the decision should:\n\n\u201cReflect that there has been substantial positive progress toward achieving the objectives of the Paris Agreement\u201d;\n\n\u201cReflect that substantially more ambition and implementation on action and support will be needed to achieve the Paris Agreement\u2019s goals\u201d;\n\n\u201cSend signals with respect to the energy transition (renewable energy, coal/oil/gas), carbon sinks including forests, non-CO2 gases [sic] including methane, and low-carbon technologies\u201d\u2019; and\n\n\u201cNote the expectation of the developed countries that the $100b goal will be met in 2023, reaffirm the urging of developed country Parties to at least double their provision of adaptation finance\u201d, among other matters.\n\nFinally, the two countries agreed to initiate or restart several cooperation platforms, including:\n\nOperationalizing the Working Group on Enhancing Climate Action in the 2020s;\n\nRecommencing bilateral dialogues on energy policies and strategies, carrying out exchanges on mutually agreed topics, and facilitating track II activities to enhance pragmatic cooperation; and\n\nInitiating a technical working group cooperation on policy dialogue, technical solutions exchanges, and capacity building on methane reduction.\n\nThe progress in improving US-China dialogue on climate change signals that the two countries have found common ground for cooperation and is a significant reversal of previous trends. US-China talks on climate change were suspended in August 2022, following Nancy Pelosi\u2019s controversial visit to Taipei.\n\nThe agreement comes ahead of the planned meeting between President Xi Jinping and President Joe Biden in San Francisco on Wednesday, November 15.\n\nDay 1025 (November 10, 2023): Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng Meets with US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen Ahead of Xi-Biden Meeting.\n\nThe bilateral meetings, which took place in San Francisco before the start of the APEC Summit, covered a broad range of issues, including bilateral engagement on climate change, debt restructuring, promoting global financial stability, national security, and outbound investment.\n\nThe two sides struck a conciliatory tone and reached a consensus to improve cooperation on a number of issues, while acknowledging areas of disagreement.\n\nIn a press briefing held at the close of the meetings, the secretary emphasized that the US aims to achieve \u201ca healthy economic relationship that benefits both our countries over time\u201d and that it does \u201cnot seek to decouple [its] economy from China\u2019s\u201d.\n\nThis sentiment was echoed in the readout from the Chinese side, which stated that China and the US \u201cdo not seek economic \u2018decoupling\u2019 and welcome the development of healthy economic relations to provide a level playing field for enterprises and workers of the two countries and enhance the well-being of the two peoples\u201d.\n\nPer the official statements, the two officials laid out \u201cspecific areas of the bilateral economic relationship where we agree\u201d, reaching important concessions in the following areas:\n\nStrengthening communication, seeking consensus, managing differences, and avoiding misunderstandings and accidental escalation of friction; this will include continuing a regular cadence of contact between Secretary Yellen and Vice Premier He.\n\nWorking together to address common challenges, including economic growth, financial stability, and regulation.\n\nCooperating on climate change-related economic issues and debt issues in low-income and emerging economies.\n\nStrengthening the international financial architecture, (including strengthening the IMF with the Executive Board\u2019s approval of an equiproportional quota increase, bolstering the IMF\u2019s ability to fight crises), and accelerating the adoption of reforms in multilateral development banks to make them better, larger, and more effective.\n\nWelcoming the objective of a healthy economic relationship that provides a level playing field for companies and workers in both countries and benefits the two peoples.\n\nYellen and He previously met in July 2023 during the former\u2019s trip to Beijing, in which the two agreed to maintain high-level exchanges and communications on economic issues in particular. These meetings resulted in the establishment of the Economic and Financial Working Groups in September, which convened \u201cfor the first time in recent weeks and had their second meetings yesterday\u201d (November 9), according to Yellen.\n\nThe meetings between He and Yellen are an important stepping stone to the much-anticipated meeting between President Xi Jinping and President Joe Biden on Wednesday, November 15, during the APEC Summit in San Francisco.\n\nDay 1025 (November 10, 2023): Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Confirms Xi-Biden Meeting at APEC Summit in San Francisco.\n\nA spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) has confirmed in a brief statement that President Xi Jinping will attend the APEC Summit in San Francisco from November 14 to 17, during which he will hold a meeting with President Joe Biden.

The US has historically not sent government officials to the CIIE, making their attendance this year all the more significant.\n\nSeveral other US agricultural groups and local US officials are also attending the expo. Among them is the US Heartland China Association, a private bipartisan organization that aims to build stronger ties between China and the US\u2019 agriculture and industry-driven heartland region, which is sending a delegation of 20 state governors \u201cto explore trade opportunities\u201d.

The APEC Summit will run from November 11 to 17 in San Francisco.\n\nWhen asked about these reports during a press briefing on November 1, Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbin would not confirm the meeting, simply saying that \u201cChina and the US agreed to work together for a meeting between the two heads of state in San Francisco\u201d.\n\nIf the meeting goes ahead as planned, it will be the first face-to-face meeting between the two leaders since November 2022, when they met on the sidelines of the G20 Summit in Bali, Indonesia.\n\nDay 1011 to 1013 (October 27 to 29): Foreign Minister Wang Yi Meets Joe Biden and Top US Officials in Washington Visit, Laying Groundwork for Xi-Biden Meeting.\n\nChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with US President Joe Biden and other high-level US officials during his trip to Washington DC, a preparatory visit ahead of the potential meeting between Biden and President Xi Jinping at the APEC Conference in San Francisco in November.\n\nThe anticipated meeting was raised several times over the course of the trip, despite a Foreign Ministry spokesperson stating that the road to San Francisco \u201cwould not be a smooth one\u201d.\n\nA brief readout of the meeting from China\u2019s Foreign Ministry states that the purpose of the meeting was to \u201ccommunicate with the US side to earnestly implement the important common understandings between the two heads of state\u201d, with Wang stating that \u201cthe two sides should work to stabilize the China-US relationship from further deterioration, and bring it back to the track of sound and stable development at an early date\u201d. The Foreign Ministry readout also noted the \u201cupcoming meeting in San Francisco\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, according to a readout from the White House, Biden \u201cemphasized that both the United States and China need to manage competition in the relationship responsibly and maintain open lines of communication\u201d and that \u201cthe United States and China must work together to address global challenges\u201d.\n\nDuring his trip to DC, Wang also met with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. In the meeting with Sullivan, which focused on matters related to international security, the two sides \u201creaffirmed their desire to maintain this strategic channel of communication and to pursue additional high-level diplomacy, including working together towards a meeting between President Biden and President Xi Jinping in San Francisco in November.\u201d\n\nWang also held two rounds of meetings with Secretary of State Antony Blinken, in which \u201cBoth sides agreed to work together to achieve a meeting between the two heads of state in San Francisco\u201d, per the Foreign Ministry. The two sides committed to engaging in various forms of communication, including \u201cChina-US maritime affairs consultations, China-US military control and non-proliferation consultations, China-US foreign policy consultations, and China-US coordination on disability affairs\u201d. They also discussed signing a memorandum of understanding on cooperation on disability affairs in the near future.\n\nThey also agreed to further increase the number of direct passenger flights between China and the US.\n\nDay 1009 (October 25, 2023): President Xi Jinping Meets with California Governor Gavin Newsom in Beijing During Trip to Advance China-US Cooperation on Climate Change.\n\nXi Jinping has held a surprise meeting with Governor of California Gavin Newsom, during the latter\u2019s trip to China, the first by a US governor in four years. During his trip, the Governor also met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Vice President Han Zheng, and signed a climate-focused Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) Zheng Shanjie.\n\nAccording to a readout from the Office of the Governor of California, throughout the meetings, the Governor discussed \u201chow California and China can continue working together to advance climate action, promote economic development and tourism, and strengthen cultural ties\u201d. He also refuted the possibility of US-China \u201cdecoupling\u201d, stating that \u201cDivorce is not an option. The only way we can solve the climate crisis is to continue our long-standing cooperation with China.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, during his meeting with Newsom, President Xi made comments of a similar nature, stating that \u201cChina and the US have huge potential for cooperation in areas such as green development and addressing climate change\u201d, per a readout from China\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA). Newsom also pointed out the importance of local connections between China and California, stating that \u201clocal exchanges are an important part of US-China relations. Historically, the Chinese have made important contributions to the construction of California, and California has always been an important gateway for the US to cooperate with China.\u201d\n\nThe meetings come two days before Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi\u2019s planned trip to Washington, which is seen as a crucial step toward arranging a meeting between Xi and Biden in November.\n\nDay 1008 (October 24, 2023): Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi to Visit US from October 26.\n\nChina\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) has confirmed that Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi will visit the US from October 26 to 28, at the invitation of the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken.\n\nAccording to the announcement from the US Department of State, Blinken and Wang will discuss \u201ca range of bilateral, regional, and global issues as part of ongoing efforts to responsibly manage the US-China relationship and to maintain open channels of communication\u201d.\n\nThe visit is widely being seen as an effort to lay the groundwork for a potential meeting between Presidents Xi and Biden at the upcoming APEC Summit in November in San Francisco.\n\nDay 1001 (October 17, 2023): US Further Tightens Export Controls of Advanced Chips to China\n\nThe Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) of the US Department of Commerce (DOC) has released three rules tightening export restrictions on advanced computing semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and supercomputing items to China. The US claims China is using these types of items and technologies for military purposes.\n\nThe aim of the updated rules is to \u201cincrease effectiveness of our controls and further shut off pathways to evade our restrictions\u201d, according to a BIS press release. They thereby \u201caddress [\u2026] the PRC\u2019s efforts to obtain semiconductor manufacturing equipment essential to producing advanced integrated circuits needed for the next generation of advanced weapon systems, as well as high-end advanced computing semiconductors necessary to enable the development and production of technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) used in military applications.\u201d\n\nThe three new rules are summarized below.\n\nRule 1: The Advanced Computing Chips Rule adjusts parameters to determine whether an advanced computing chip is restricted, including a \u201cperformance density threshold\u201d to prevent workarounds. It also imposes new measures to prevent circumvention of the controls, including requiring worldwide licensing to export controlled chips to any company headquartered or with an ultimate parent company located in a country or region subject to a US arms embargo.\n\nRule 2: The Expansion of Export Controls on Semiconductor Manufacturing Items imposes controls on additional types of semiconductor manufacturing equipment (SME), refines certain measures to ensure US companies cannot provide support to advanced Chinese semiconductor manufacturing while avoiding unintended impacts and expands license requirements for SME to all countries subject to a US arms embargo.\n\nRule 3: The addition of 13 Chinese entities to the Entity List due to their alleged involvement \u201cin the development of advanced computing chips that have been found to be engaged in activities contrary to US national security and foreign policy interest\u201d. Companies producing chips for these entities will be required to obtain a license from the BIS.\n\nAnalysts have noted that the changes to the restriction parameters for semiconductors will prevent major chip manufacturers such as Nvidia from exporting high-performance semiconductors to China.\n\nChina has stated strong opposition to the further tightening of chip export controls, calling for their removal. A spokesperson of the Chinese Ministry of Commerce stated that the US \u201chas been overstretching the concept of national security, abusing export control measures\u201d, and that the controls \u201cseverely damage market rules and international economic and trade order\u201d and \u201ccause heavy loss to US semiconductor firms and affects their counterparts in other countries\u201d.\n\nThe BIS is soliciting public opinion on the three rules for a period of 60 days, after which they will come into force.\n\nDay 991 to 993 (October 7 to 9, 2023): Xi Jinping Meets with US Congressional Delegation in Beijing During China Visit\n\nA US bipartisan congressional delegation led by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer held a rare meeting with President Xi Jinping on Monday afternoon.\n\nDuring the meeting, at which the Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi was also present, President Xi called for increased cooperation between China and the US, stating that \u201cthe economies of China and the United States are deeply integrated, and we can benefit from each other\u2019s development\u201d, according to the official state media Xinhua News.\n\nHe also welcomed more members of the US Congress to visit China, and said \u201cIt is hoped that the legislative bodies of the two countries will have more contacts, dialogues and exchanges to enhance mutual understanding and make positive contributions to the stabilization and improvement of Sino-US relations.\u201d\n\nThe delegation had met separately with Wang Yi earlier in the day. This meeting focused on improving the business environment for American companies and improving US-China business ties. According to the Associated Press, Schumer stated \u201cWe want the Chinese people to have economic opportunity. That would be good for America,\u201d and that \u201cChina must also provide a level playing field for American companies and workers.\u201d\n\nWang reportedly \u201curged the United States to respect China\u2019s core interests and development rights. The Chinese government views American restrictions on trade and technology exports to China as attempts to hold back the country\u2019s economic growth.\u201d\n\nThe surprise meeting with Xi has been viewed as a positive development and has raised hopes that a meeting with US President Joe Biden could take place at the APEC Summit in November.\n\nThe US delegation arrived in Shanghai on Saturday, the first such visit by US lawmakers since 2019, under the previous administration. In Shanghai, the lawmakers met with the Secretary of the Shanghai Communist Party Chen Jining.\n\nThe meeting in Shanghai focused largely on promoting the interest of US businesses in China. According to Reuters, Schumer reiterated that the US does not seek to decouple from China, but also raised concerns of American businesses, stating that \u201c\u2018many of our constituents feel that in instances China does not treat American companies fairly.\u2019\u201d According to Chinese media reports, Chen Jining told the delegation that \u201cAmerican companies are welcome to seize the opportunities of Chinese-style modernization and tap into the vast Chinese market through Shanghai\u201d. He also stated that the city \u201cwill continue to create a market-oriented, legal and international first-class business environment\u201d.\n\nThe delegation will also visit the northwestern city of Xi\u2019an in Shaanxi Province before ending their China visit.\n\nDay 990 (October 6, 2023): US Commerce Department Adds 42 Chinese Entities to Export Control List For Alleged Support to Russia\u2019s Military\n\nThe Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) of the US Department of Commerce announced that it has added 49 entities to the Entity List \u201cfor providing support to Russia\u2019s military and/or defense industrial base\u201d, of which 42 are Chinese.\n\nAccording to the statement, \u201cThese entities supplied Russian consignees connected to the Russian defense sector with US-origin integrated circuits\u201d. The statement says that Russia relies upon these components for precision guidance systems in the missiles and drones used in the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nIn a statement responding to the news, China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce called the move a \u201ctypical act of economic coercion and unilateral bullying\u201d and called on the US to \u201cimmediately correct its wrong practices and stop its unreasonable suppression of Chinese companies\u201d.\n\nDay 976 (September 22, 2023): Chinese and US Finance Ministries Establish Joint Financial and Economic Working Groups.\n\nThe US Treasury Department and Chinese Ministry of Finance (MOF) announced the establishment of a joint Economic Working Group and Financial Working Group, fulfilling a commitment made during US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen\u2019s visit to Beijing in July.\n\nAccording to the announcement from the US Treasury Department, the two working groups, which will be under the direction of Yellen and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, will provide \u201congoing structured channels for frank and substantive discussions on economic and financial policy matters\u201d.\n\nVice ministerial-level officials of the two groups will reportedly meet \u201con a regular cadence\u201d and report to Secretary Yellen and Vice Premier He.\n\nAccording to sources cited by the South China Morning Post, the two sides \u201chave resumed talks in several areas and are working on opening dialogues on arms control and artificial intelligence, but there has been limited progress on resuming military-to-military communications.\u201d\n\nThe two working groups are the latest effort made by China and the US to improve ties and enhance bilateral cooperation on important issues. However, it is unclear whether they will be able to make breakthroughs on matters like export controls.\n\nThe announcement comes in the wake of a series of meetings between US and Chinese officials in recent weeks and months, which could potentially lay the groundwork for a meeting between President Biden and President Xi.\n\nDay 972 (September 18, 2023): US Secretary of State Meets Chinese Vice President in New York.\n\nThe US Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Chinese Vice President Han Zheng at the sidelines of the 78th UN General Assembly in New York City, a day following the meeting between Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met\n\nThe readouts from the White House and the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) repeated familiar talking points from recent meetings between US and Chinese officials. The White House readout stated that Blinken and Han \u201cexchanged views on a range of key bilateral, global, and regional issues, including Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine, the DPRK\u2019s provocative actions, and other topics.\u201d Blinken also \u201cemphasized that the United States will continue to use diplomacy to advance US interests and values and to discuss areas of difference\u2019.\n\nMeanwhile, according to the readout from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA), Han stated that \u201chealthy and stable Sino-US relations are beneficial to both countries and the world\u201d and that \u201cChina\u2019s development is an opportunity rather than a challenge to the United States, and a gain rather than a risk\u201d. Blinken reportedly stated that the US \u201chopes that China will succeed and continue to promote world economic growth\u201d.\n\nMeetings between Chinese and US officials have become increasingly frequent over the past few months as both sides seek to find common ground on important issues. These meetings may also lay the groundwork for potential meetings between President Biden and President Xi, which could take place at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in San Francisco in November, a year after their last meeting in Bali.\n\nDay 970 to 971 (September 16 to 17, 2023): US National Security Advisor Meets Chinese Foreign Minister in Malta.\n\nUS National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met with the Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Malta, holding what were described as \u201ccandid, substantive, and constructive discussions\u201d. The pair last met in May in Vienna.\n\nThe readouts from both the White House and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (M",

        "text": "Pope Francis: Trump and Harris are \u2018both against life\u2019 but Catholics must vote and choose \u2018lesser evil\u2019\nThe U.S. presidential election in November took center stage in the 42-minute press conference given by Pope Francis on the flight from Singapore to Rome on Sept. 13. An American journalist asked the pope what advice he would give to Catholics in the United States on voting, given that one of the candidates, Vice President Kamala Harris, supports broad access to abortion, while the other candidate, former president Donald J. Trump, says that if elected, he will deport 11 million undocumented migrants.\n\n\u201cBoth are against life. Both are against life. Both: the one who throws out migrants and the one who kills children. Both are against life,\u201d Pope Francis stated.\n\nHis answer reaffirmed what he has taught since his election as pope: Abortion is against the Catholic Church\u2019s teaching on life, but so, too, are other assaults on human dignity that affect the poor, migrants, victims of human trafficking and others.\n\nThe U.S. bishops have long described abortion and euthanasia as \u201cpre-eminent\u201d concerns for political engagement in their teaching document \u201cForming Consciences for Faithful Citizenship.\u201d In 2019, the bishops quoted Pope Francis in their introductory letter to that document but rejected a proposal to include a full paragraph from his exhortation \u201cGaudete et Exsultate\u201d in which he critiques the view that \u201cthe only thing that counts is one particular ethical issue or cause\u201d (No. 101).\n\n[Pope Francis talks Gaza war, China deal, sex abuse and more on flight back to Rome]\n\nFrancis says he is aware of how U.S. bishops generally view the question of abortion as it relates to the election from discussions at the Vatican during their ad limina visits and on other occasions.\n\nIn November 2023, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops adopted a new introduction to \u201cFaithful Citizenship\u201d that affirmed abortion as their pre-eminent priority, despite calls from some bishops to overhaul the document in response to modern challenges and to reflect new insights from Pope Francis. The document was produced in 2007, before the Francis papacy.\n\nAt today\u2019s press conference, the pope explained why he saw the positions of both presidential candidates as \u201cagainst life.\u201d He began by addressing the question of migrants, saying, \u201cTo send migrants away or to not give migrants the ability to work, to not give migrants a welcome, is serious. It is a sin.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the Old Testament,\u201d he recalled, \u201cthere is a refrain: the orphan, the widow and the stranger\u2014 that is, the migrant. They are the three that the people of Israel must protect. The one who does not protect the migrant is failing. It is a sin. It\u2019s also a sin against the life of those people.\u201d\n\n\u201cI celebrated Mass at the border, close to the Diocese of El Paso,\u201d the pope said. \u201cAnd there were many shoes of migrants who ended badly there.\u201d He was referring to his visit to Mexico in February 2016, when he celebrated Mass in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, as people from El Paso prayed on the U.S. side of the border wall. Before that Mass, a priest from Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez had placed worn migrants\u2019 shoes at the foot of a cross facing the bridges that span the Rio Grande.\n\n\u201cToday,\u201d he said, \u201cthere is a flow of migrants in Central America, who often are treated like slaves.\u201d\n\nFrancis, the son of Italian migrants to Argentina, emphasized that \u201cimmigration is a right, a right that is in sacred Scripture, and it was in the Old Testament: the stranger, the orphan and the widow. Don\u2019t forget that. That\u2019s what I think on migrants.\u201d\n\nTurning to the question of abortion, Francis was equally forthright. He said, \u201cScience says that a month after conception all of the organs of a human being are there. All of them.\u201d\n\nTherefore, he said, \u201c[t]o have an abortion is to kill a human being. You may like the word, or you don\u2019t like it, but it is to kill\u2026. The church does not permit abortion. Why? Because it is to kill, it\u2019s an assassination. It\u2019s an assassination, and we must have things clear on this.\u201d\n\nHe then returned to the rejection of migrants. \u201cTo send migrants away, to not allow them to develop, to not allow them to have life, is a bad thing. It is evil.\u201d Likewise, he said, \u201cTo send away a child from the womb of the mother is an assassination because there is life.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWe must speak about these things clearly\u2026. There are no \u2018buts.\u2019 Both things are clear.\u201d He again reminded people not to overlook \u201cthe orphan, the stranger and the widow.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. journalist, however, persisted in the topic and asked, \u201cIn your view, your holiness, are there circumstances in which it is morally licit for a Catholic to vote for a candidate who is in favor of abortion?\n\nThe Jesuit pope did not provide a yes-or-no answer. Instead, he responded: \u201cIn the moral [teaching] about politics, in general, it is said that to not vote is bad. It is not good. You must vote, and one has to choose the lesser evil.\u201d\n\nIn this situation, he asked, \u201cWhat is the lesser evil? That woman, or that man?\u201d He said: \u201cI don\u2019t know. Each one, in their conscience, must think and [vote].\u201d\n\nRead more from America:",

All other voters who have requested ballots by mail will also be sent absentee ballots on Sept. 24 .",
        "text": "Absentee Ballots Go Out to Military and Overseas Voters on Sept. 20, All Other Voters Who Requested Them on Sept. 24\nRaleigh, N.C.\n\nAll 100 county boards of elections must send absentee ballots to eligible military and overseas citizens who requested them for the 2024 general election on Friday, Sept. 20, under a new schedule released by the State Board of Elections.\n\nThe Board also set Sept. 24 as the date to start sending absentee ballots to other voters who have requested ballots by mail, including those who use the Visually Impaired Portal (VIP) to request and return their ballots.\n\nThis schedule ensures that North Carolina will meet the federal law requirement to distribute ballots to voters under the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA) by the 45th day before the election \u2014 Sept. 21.\n\nCounty boards were prepared to send absentee ballots out on Sept. 6, the deadline for absentee ballots to be sent under state law. However, rulings by the N.C. Court of Appeals and N.C. Supreme Court required election officials to remove the We The People party line from the presidential contest on the ballot, including the party\u2019s presidential nominee, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and vice-presidential nominee, Nicole Shanahan.\n\nIn North Carolina, any registered voter can vote an absentee ballot, after submitting a request for the ballot. Voters can request their absentee ballot at votebymail.ncsbe.gov. The deadline for absentee requests is Oct. 29. However, election officials urge voters who wish to vote by mail to request their ballot soon, so it can be completed and returned to the voter\u2019s county board of elections by 7:30 p.m. Election Day \u2014 Nov. 5.\n\nThrough Thursday, more than 166,000 voters \u2014 including more than 13,600 military and overseas voters \u2014 have requested ballots in North Carolina.\n\nDuring the past week, State Board staff, county boards of elections staff, and voting system and printing vendors have worked to code, design, proof, and print new ballots without the We The People party line. Staff have worked to devise contingency plans to ensure that ballots could be delivered as soon as practicable.\n\nDue to the timelines for the printing, delivery, and assembly of all absentee ballots in every county, the State Board concluded that the only way to meet the federal deadline for military and overseas citizens was to establish separate dates for distributing absentee ballots.\n\nElection officials will first focus on distributing the military and overseas citizen ballots, which is a smaller group of ballots. Currently, about 8% of 2024 absentee requests are from military and overseas citizen voters.\n\nState Board staff have arranged for special on-demand ballot printers to be positioned around the state to fulfill any orders for military and overseas citizen ballots for counties whose orders from their print vendors will not arrive in time for those ballots to be prepared for mailing by next Friday. These special printers can print any ballot style approved for use in the state. There are nearly 2,350 different ballot styles statewide for this election.\n\nMeanwhile, staff will work over the weekend and through next week to prepare the online military/overseas voter services portal for electronic delivery and return of ballots available for military and overseas citizen voters. Nearly 90% of military and overseas citizen voters opt for this electronic ballot delivery feature.\n\nThis plan allows time for the much larger orders of absentee ballots for all other voters to be printed and delivered to the county boards in time for counties to prepare their outgoing absentee ballot packages for mailing on Sept. 24.\n\n\u201cThis schedule is only possible because of the hard work of elections professionals across this state that will continue throughout the next week,\u201d said Karen Brinson Bell, executive director of the State Board of Elections. \u201cBecause of them, we expect to meet the federal deadline for ballot delivery, and North Carolinians can finally start voting in this important election.\u201d\n\nThe State Board has received many questions about the statewide cost of reprinting ballots. Preliminary estimates show the costs vary widely by county, depending on how many ballots must be reprinted and other factors. Estimates range from a few thousand dollars in some smaller counties to $18,000 in Caldwell County, $55,100 in Durham County and $300,000 in Wake County, home to the most registered voters in the state.\n\n2024 General Election Dates and Deadlines\n\nHere are key dates and deadlines for the 2024 general election in North Carolina:\n\nSept. 20: Ballots distributed to military and overseas citizen voters who have requested them.\n\nBallots distributed to military and overseas citizen voters who have requested them. Sept. 24: Absentee ballots distributed to all other voters who have requested them.\n\nAbsentee ballots distributed to all other voters who have requested them.

        "text": "Taylor Swift backs Kamala Harris: Can the popstar influence US presidential polls? Her swing state fanbase in numbers\nTaylor Swift is a pop sensation, but can she influence US presidential elections? On Wednesday, the 'Lover' singer supported Kamala Harris, the US Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate. In her post on social media, she shared a link where voters can find information regarding voting dates and registration.\n\nHer endorsement reportedly led to over 3 lakh people visiting vote.gov, a website where people can learn about voters' rights. The website does not register visitors to vote but rather directs them to their local state election websites for more specific voting information.\n\nThe surge in website visitors is seen as a sign of the potential effect Swift's announcement could have on November election.\n\nThe US Government Services Administration reportedly said that Swift\u2019s endorsement post on Instagram led directly to 3,37,826 people visiting vote.gov.\n\n\"As of 2:00 pm ET [11:30 pm IST Wednesday], there have been 3,37,826 visitors to the http://vote.gov website via Swift\u2019s link,\" the spokesperson of the administration told The Hollywood Reporter and NPR on Wednesday.\n\nTaylor Swift endorses Kamala, urges voters to register This happened hours after the first US presidential debate between Kamala Harris and her rival, Donald Trump, took place around 6:30 am (IST) on Wednesday. In a post on Instagram, Swift wrote that she would be voting for Harris and Governor Tim Walz, her Democratic running mate.\n\nSwift also urged US citizens to cast their vote. She wrote, \u201cI\u2019ve done my research, and I\u2019ve made my choice. Your research is all yours to do, and the choice is yours to make. I also want to say, especially to first-time voters: Remember that in order to vote, you have to be registered! I also find it\u2019s much easier to vote early. I\u2019ll link where to register and find early voting dates and info in my story.\u201d\n\nCan Taylor Swift influence voters in US elections? Taylor Swift has driven voter numbers in the past, but it yet could not be substantiated whether she could sway voters' decisions over whom to vote for. Here's a look at what's said so far:\n\n1. A poll conducted for Newsweek by Redfield & Wilton Strategies in January 2024 found that 18 per cent of voters say they're \"more likely\" or \"significantly more likely\" to vote for a candidate endorsed by Swift.\n\nAccording to the report, 17 per cent said they would be less likely to vote for a Swift-backed candidate, while 55 per cent said they would be neither more nor less likely to do so.\n\nAmong all the respondents in the survey, 45 per cent said they were fans of the singer, and 54 per cent said they were not. Only 6 per cent said they were not familiar with Swift.\n\n2. It's also contended that while it's unlikely Swift\u2019s opinion will sway voters, her influence could bolster turnout. In a survey (of nearly 500 people) conducted by the Guardian, most of the respondents said Swift's endorsement would not influence their vote. A few respondents said that other voters may be more susceptible and some did say that Swift\u2019s opinions may influence their behaviour, if not their vote.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not influenced by her, but my kids\u2019 generation is,\u201d one person from Massachusetts was quoted as saying. \u201cI\u2019m much too well informed,\u201d someone from Colorado added, \u201cBut it WILL affect young people.\u201d\n\n3. Meanwhile, an expert told ABC News that \"social signaling\" could impact people's voting choice in US elections. Marcus Collins, a marketing professor at the University of Michigan, explained, \u201cIf you self-identify as someone who sees the world like Taylor Swift does, you might go, \u2018Huh, maybe I should be voting like that also'...It sort of sends a bat signal for what potentially is acceptable for people like me.\"\n\n4. In 2018 mid-term polls, Swift's major political endorsement of Democrat Phil Bredesen couldn't help him much. Bredesen lost but Swift's endorsement demonstrated her influence \u2013 with Vote.org saying it had received nearly 65,000 registrations from voters aged 18-29 in the 24 hours after Swift\u2019s post, The Independent reported.\n\n5. Meanwhile, Lauren Rosewarne, a University of Melbourne professor, told the BBC that Swift's endorsement could impact voter registration. The report added that Swift's fan-base skews young and female. And that is already the Harris supporter base and so her endorsement may not have a big impact come November. \"Harris's main problem lies with male voters...I'm not sure Swift moves them,\" said Rosewarne.\n\nIn data: Taylor Swift's fanbase in swing states A swing state is where Republican and Democratic candidates have similar levels of support and that could potentially be won by either candidate. They are also known as battleground states. The presidential race will most likely come down to voters in eight states that remain competitive.\n\nData released by betting odds experts AceOdds in February this year showed that Taylor Swift's fan base is increasing in the swing states. The study revealed that Google searches around the popstar increase by 216 per cent on average in the past year.\n\nAlso Read | Donald Trump, Kamala Harris neck and neck in key swing states as election nears\n\n\"The biggest growing fan bases are in solid Republican States Florida (+219%), Iowa (+273%), and Michigan (+228%). Four of the five \u2018tossup\u2019 states saw higher than average searches for Taylor Swift, especially in Wisconsin, which increased by +282%,\" the data revealed.\n\nAceOdds analysed search trend data over the past year and calculated which states have had the highest surge of Taylor Swift fans and compared them with the latest poll results and the number of electoral votes available to reveal where her influence may hold the most power in the election.\n\nAccording to the data accessed by Mint, states such as Florida, Iowa, and Michigan saw the biggest increase in Taylor Swift fans. The three states have a total of 51 electoral votes between them.\n\nSwift\u2019s army of fans in 2023 saw searches related to her increase 219 per cent in Florida. Iowa, considered \u2018solid\u2019 for the Republican party, saw a search increase of 273 per cent. Michigan, which voted Democrat in 2020 but is considered to be leaning Republican, saw a search increase of 228 per cent for Taylor Swift in 2023, the data showed.\n\nMeanwhile, \"more influential states\" such as Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, which have 19 and 10 electoral votes, saw fanbases increase above average, seeing a 222 per cent increase in Taylor Swift searches in Pennsylvania and a 282 per cent increase in Wisconsin.\n\nMaine and Nebraska have a smaller influence on the election, holding 4 and 5 electoral votes. Data suggested that a 239 per cent increase in searches related to Taylor Swift was witnessed in Maine and a 227 per cent increase was seen in Nebraska. In Arizona, the searches for Swift was below the average increase in swing states, at 185 per cent.\n\nIf the Taylor Swift effect really is as influential as it seems, this could mean a big gain for the Democrats if they can win both states.",

        "text": "The truth about early voting in Pennsylvania\nThose reports may create misunderstandings about how Pennsylvania\u2019s voting works, election officials say, and they ignore the fact that ballots are being delayed by ongoing court cases.\n\nOn Thursday, The New York Times wrote that on Sept. 16 \u201cPennsylvania starts in-person early voting and begins sending mail-in ballots\u201d to voters. USA Today reported on Tuesday that \u201cearly voting for some counties\u201d in Pennsylvania would begin Monday. And Fox News reported on Sept. 3 that \u201cearly voting begins on Sept. 16 in Pennsylvania.\u201d\n\nEarly in-person voting will not start in Pennsylvania next week, despite what several national media outlets have reported this month.\n\nUPDATE, Sept. 16 : All third-party ballot access cases pending before the Pennsylvania Supreme Court have been resolved. The secretary of the commonwealth certified the November list of candidates Monday afternoon. It will still take counties some time to print ballots. Check the status of your county here .\n\nThis article is made possible through Spotlight PA\u2019s collaboration with Votebeat , a nonpartisan news organization covering local election administration and voting. Sign up for Votebeat's free newsletters here .\n\nPA Local (Weekly) : A fresh look at the incredible people, places, and food of Pa. every Friday, plus events, guides, best-of, and more.\n\n\u201cWe have been hearing from voters and other entities that ballots will be going out on Monday, September 16. That is not accurate,\u201d Cumberland County Elections Director Bethany Salzarulo said in a statement. \u201cHistorically mail-in and absentee ballots are sent out three to four weeks prior to any election, and we are on track to do the same for the upcoming presidential election.\u201d\n\nPennsylvania has a voting option that\u2019s similar to what other states call early in-person voting \u2014 typically offered at convenient early-voting polling sites \u2014 but it\u2019s not exactly the same, and it won\u2019t be available next week.\n\nPennsylvania refers to this option as voting in person by mail ballot, and it\u2019s meant to be available before Election Day. With this option, voters can visit their county elections office, apply for a mail ballot, fill it out, and return it on the spot.\n\nSept. 16 is the day by which counties must start processing mail ballot applications \u2014 the forms for requesting a mail ballot. If the ballots themselves were ready that day, then theoretically voters could request one and return it in one visit to the county office.\n\nBut the ballots won\u2019t be available by Sept. 16.\n\nThat\u2019s because the finalization of ballots for November\u2019s election is currently being delayed by cases before the Pennsylvania Supreme Court dealing with third-party candidates' access to the ballot. There are currently four cases involving three slates of presidential and vice presidential candidates. (Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is not one of them.) All cases are currently awaiting rulings from the court.\n\nThose challenges need to be resolved before the list of candidates can be certified by the Secretary of the Commonwealth and counties can print ballots.\n\nCounties also typically use outside companies to print their ballots, which means that even after the candidates are finalized and the ballot is proofread for accuracy, it will still take time for ballots to be printed and mailed to counties and voters.\n\n\u201cThis process may still take several weeks after a certified list of candidates is available before ballots appear in voters\u2019 mailboxes, and thus counties urge the courts to resolve the remaining objections as quickly as possible to help counties meet their goal of administering a smooth, fair and accurate election,\u201d John Buffone, spokesperson for the County Commissioners Association of Pennsylvania, said in a statement.",

        "text": "How Trump is relying on a racist conspiracy theory to question election results\nHow Trump is relying on a racist conspiracy theory to question election results\n\ntoggle caption Matt Slocum/AP\n\nWhen former President Donald Trump told millions of Americans during Tuesday's presidential debate that \"our elections are bad, and a lot of these illegal immigrants coming in, they're trying to get them to vote,\" he was not just repeating a baseless claim intended to undermine the results of the upcoming 2024 election.\n\nHe was also echoing the latest iteration of a once-fringe racist conspiracy theory that has now become mainstream in the Republican Party. The conspiracy \u2014 known as the \"great replacement\" \u2014 claims there is a plan to bring nonwhite immigrants into the United States and other Western countries to replace white voters to achieve a political agenda.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThroughout this presidential campaign season, Trump and his allies have repeatedly claimed that Democrats allowed migrants to enter the country so they would vote in the 2024 election \u2014 despite the fact that no evidence has surfaced of a mass scheme to register undocumented immigrants. Noncitizen voting in federal elections is illegal and rare, and there are checks in place to deter and prevent it. (A small number of localities permit noncitizens to vote in municipal elections for positions such as school board member using separate ballots from those used for state and national elections. The number of noncitizens who ultimately cast ballots is very small.)\n\n\"They can't even speak English. They don't even know what country they're in, practically. And these people are trying to get them to vote, and that's why they're allowing them into our country,\" Trump said during Tuesday's debate.\n\nSocial media influencers and groups allied with Trump have sought to keep the issue alive, frequently hyping thinly sourced stories that claim noncitizens are being encouraged to vote but that have turned up no concrete evidence.\n\nNPR has reported that replacement theory has penetrated a much more mainstream portion of American society in recent years. A 2022 poll, conducted by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, found that 1 in 3 American adults now believes in a version of it.\n\n\n\nSponsor Message\n\nRhetoric with a history of inspiring violence\n\nCynthia Miller-Idriss, a professor at American University and the founding director of the Polarization and Extremism Research and Innovation Lab (PERIL), said the baseless narrative has become so commonplace in the Republican Party's political rhetoric that she barely registered Trump's invocation of it during the debate.\n\n\"Not only did it not shock me \u2014 I didn't even hear it,\" she said.\n\nMiller-Idriss said that replacement theory fits into an array of fears that GOP elected officials and right-wing media outlets like Fox News have stoked around the theme that political elites, a shadowy cabal of power brokers or even undocumented immigrants are trying to rob Americans of something they hold dear.\n\n\"Whether it's your Second Amendment rights or your white-majority country or \u2026 your votes are being stolen. ... Now your pets are being stolen and then eaten,\" she said. \"I mean, it's so absurd to hear it go to the pets, but it's the same thing. There's always something that's being taken away from you and unfairly given to someone else. That narrative is incredibly powerful.\"\n\nBut Miller-Idriss warns that using replacement conspiracy to motivate people to vote against Democrats is also dangerous. Not only will it prime Trump's base to doubt the results of the election, should he lose, but it is also a narrative that has driven deadly far-right attacks around the world.\n\n\"It really mobilizes a fringe to violence,\" Miller-Idriss said. \"We've seen that in Christchurch, we saw it in Oslo, with terrorist attacks in El Paso, in Pittsburgh, in Buffalo. In lots of places, we've seen that exact conspiracy theory mobilized violence.\"\n\nTwo days after the debate, an emailed bomb threat shut down City Hall and multiple municipal facilities in Springfield, Ohio. Springfield was the center of the unfounded claim that Trump amplified during the debate, falsely asserting that Haitian immigrants were eating residents' pets. The bomb threat suggests that untruths about migration may feed threats of violence for some time.\n\n\"That's what I'm most worried about,\" said Heidi Beirich, co-founder of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, which tracks domestic and transnational far-right movements.\n\nBeirich said that the normalization of replacement theory may not only feed further domestic attacks but also contribute to an increase in everyday hate crimes against anyone perceived as nonwhite. She noted that hate crimes in the U.S. have already been rising over several years.\n\n\"This is going to make the problem worse for anybody who appears to be an immigrant,\" she said. \"Anybody a white supremacist thinks shouldn't be here is a possible target. And that's really scary.\"\n\nConsequences for democracy\n\nAs politicians have echoed replacement theory rhetoric this campaign season and heightened fears around noncitizens voting, officials have taken actions that have consequences for voters.\n\nEligible voters, especially naturalized citizens but also voters born in the U.S., have been erroneously entangled in efforts by state election officials to flag possible noncitizens on voter rolls in recent months.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAfter a Fox Business host spread a baseless rumor about undocumented immigrants registering to vote in Texas last month, the state's Republican attorney general launched a criminal probe into voter registration groups \u2014 which local advocacy groups say has a chilling effect on lawful efforts to promote voting.\n\nSuch efforts could increase \"the threat of violence and sense of fear at polling places \u2014 and are thinly disguised attempts to intimidate voters of color and naturalized citizens,\" wrote attorneys Anna Dorman and Kenneth Parreno in a recent newsletter for Protect Democracy, a nonprofit that works to counter authoritarianism.\n\nGOP House Speaker Mike Johnson, who has a history of echoing replacement theory language, is championing the SAVE Act, which would require documentary proof of citizenship to register to vote. He is attempting to tie it to a federal funding bill that must pass by the end of the month to avoid a government shutdown.\n\n\"Democrats have expressed a desire to turn noncitizens into voters,\" Johnson said when he introduced the SAVE Act in May. \"That's what this open border has been all about.\"\n\nIn New Hampshire, Republican Gov. Chris Sununu signed a law on Thursday requiring evidence of citizenship when registering to vote and photo identification at the ballot box. The law won't take effect until after November's general election.\n\nDemocratic opponents of these measures say the current system is already working to deter noncitizens from voting, as evidenced by the very small number of documented cases.\n\nThey also say the proposed federal legislation would make it harder for some eligible U.S. citizens to vote, especially voters of color, who are more likely to lack access to a document proving their citizenship, like a birth certificate or passport.\n\nThe decision by Republicans to fixate on this bill on the eve of the election \u2014 when it is already too late to change protocols for this contest \u2014 indicates the goal is to provide \"oxygen for lies in the post-election period if Trump loses,\" said David Becker, the executive director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"You can absolutely bet if Trump loses, he will claim there was widespread noncitizen voting without any evidence whatsoever,\" Becker said. \"And that is going to incite anger and potentially violence.\"",

        "text": "2024 elections: Immigration at the forefront\nEXPERTS ADVISORY\n\nImmigration consistently emerges as an important issue during U.S. election cycles due to its deep ties to national security, economic policy and cultural identity. As the country struggles with questions about border control, pathways to citizenship and the role of immigrants in the workforce, the topic remains highly polarizing.\n\nWith demographic shifts and global migration trends influencing policy discussions, immigration is set to be a defining factor in the 2024 election. Both major parties are expected to spotlight their approaches, from stricter border enforcement to comprehensive reform that includes protections for undocumented immigrants.\n\nU-M experts are available to discuss related issues.\n\nMara Cecilia Ostfeld\n\nMara Cecilia Ostfeld is an associate research scientist and research director at the Center for Racial Justice at the Ford School of Public Policy.\n\n\u201cImmigration is set to be a defining issue in the 2024 elections, but it\u2019s important to recognize that public opinion on immigration is nuanced and multifaceted,\u201d she said. \u201cEach dimension of immigration policy\u2014whether it\u2019s border security, the treatment of immigrants, the number of opportunities for people to legally immigrate to the U.S., authorization to work during pending immigration decisions, or pathways to citizenship\u2014draws distinctly different responses from voters.\n\n\u201cBut as Americans form their views toward immigration policy, it is helpful to recall that just four years ago, many immigrants were deemed \u2018essential workers.\u2019 These individuals were called to work in dangerous conditions without access to vaccines or personal protective equipment so that the rest of us could be safe and the U.S. economy could continue to operate. To now scapegoat immigrants for current economic challenges represents a striking reversal. As we shape our views on immigration policy, we should consider the contributions of these individuals and reject narratives of blame that undermine their role in our society.\u201d\n\nContact: [email protected]\n\nWilliam Lopez\n\nWilliam Lopez is a clinical assistant professor of health behavior and health equity at the School of Public Health, senior adviser at Poverty Solutions and faculty associate in the Latina/o Studies Program.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear from the debates that immigration enforcement will be used by both political parties to bring conservative and moderate voters to their side,\u201d he said. \u201cDemocrats continue to reinforce the need for a border wall and Vice President Harris references her time as a prosecutor in which she put undocumented immigrants behind bars, a nod to her \u2018law and order\u2019 voters without using the phrase.\n\n\u201cTrump, meanwhile, is continuing with his fearmongering of immigrants, saying that immigrants are eating people\u2019s pets and that Kamala is advocating for \u2018transgender operations on illegal aliens that are in prison.\u2019 While this language is shocking and not rooted in any observable truth, the strategy of dehumanizing immigrants\u2014painting them as \u2018savages,\u2019 arguing for their biological inferiority, suggesting that they usurp gender norms, and implying that they overutilize public benefits on unnecessary medical procedures\u2014has been apparent and utilized many times throughout the country\u2019s history. This approach is foundational to the Trump campaign.\u201d\n\nContact: [email protected]\n\nKristina Fullerton Rico\n\nKristina Fullerton Rico is a postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Racial Justice at the Ford School of Public Policy.\n\n\u201cIn the midst of debates about immigration as a policy issue, the reality that immigrants are a vital part of U.S. communities is often lost. It is impossible to make generalizations about such a large group of people,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, it is clear that immigrants contribute to the country in a variety of ways.\n\n\u201cSince 1986, the United States has restricted opportunities for people to migrate legally and to become permanent residents after migrating. Today, 11 million immigrants hold liminal or undocumented immigration statuses that negatively impact their lives and the lives of their families. Americans may be surprised to learn that one of the most significant penalties for this group of immigrants is the inability to travel in and out of the United States.\n\n\u201cWhat this means is that if undocumented or liminally documented immigrants travel to their countries of origin, they risk never being able to return to the homes and lives they have made in the United States.\n\n\u201cFor most people, this is a risk that is too great to take, so they do not dare visit their parents, siblings and friends. Many of their children grow up without ever meeting their grandparents. As we approach 40 years without immigration reform that allows undocumented or liminally documented immigrants to become citizens, many immigrants are forced to mourn the deaths of their loved ones from afar.\u201d\n\nContact: [email protected]",

        "text": "All eyes are on Nebraska's 'blue dot,' which could determine who wins the White House\nOMAHA, Neb. \u2212 It's challenging to drive through Nebraska's biggest city without seeing white signs with a singular blue circle peppering many front lawns. Though they don't have any words, names or messaging, these dots have become a symbol of Democratic support in a deep red state, beginning with Jason Brown's inaugural sign on his front yard.\n\nWith a nod to the Cornhusker State's 2nd District's electoral point, Democrats have coined the \"blue dot,\" which they hope to deliver to Vice President Kamala Harris. Since the first blue dot went up at the end of August, Brown and his wife, Ruth, have received thousands of requests from people across the district and the state who want their own.\n\n\"I didn't realize the extent to which people needed to understand that our vote really does matter in this district,\" Brown said. \"It's created an interesting buzz. Obviously, the biggest is right here in CD-2, that it's a neat way of saying Nebraska is getting itself on the map and in the conversation.\"\n\nAcross town, a dozen volunteers called voters, urging them to support former President Donald Trump from the campaign's state headquarters in a strip mall office space. One of the volunteers is Carolyn Neopdal, a retired nurse who joined the campaign last month and has knocked on doors in neighborhoods across town.\n\n\"Trust me, I do not have time to do this, but I'm taking time because it's important that we win this country back and get Trump in there, and it's important that we win this district,\" Nepodal said. \"So I am doing whatever I can and talking to the people.\"\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nThough they don't see eye-to-eye politically, Nebraskans in the area backing either Harris or Trump agree that the presidential election could hinge on their home district.\n\nIn 48 states and Washington, D.C., the winner gets all the electoral votes for that state. Maine and Nebraska assign their electors using a proportional system.\n\nRecent polling in Nebraska's 2nd District shows Harris ahead of Trump by about 8 points in the otherwise ruby-red state, according to the Nebraska Examiner.\n\nWith less than eight weeks until the general election, Republicans and Democrats are fighting tooth and nail for the state's one electoral vote, which could break a tie and get either candidate to 270 electoral votes, the number needed to win the presidency.\n\nThe deep purple tug-of-war\n\nBoth the Trump and Biden-turned-Harris campaigns have been present in the district for months, but both have recently kicked their operations into high gear, pouring money into ground operations and sending surrogates to stake claims in the area. Both know it could all come down to the Cornhusker State.\n\nThough most congressional districts consistently go for Republicans or Democrats, Nebraska's 2nd district is one of the last truly purple districts in the country, according to Barry Burden, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\n\n\"Even with the switch from Biden to Harris, it still looks like the district could be a tiebreaker in the Electoral College if Harris is able to hold on to the three states in the Midwest, the so-called 'blue wall states,'\" Burden said.\n\nMore:In battle between Trump and Harris, both campaigns target the Blue Wall\n\nNebraska's unique system drew national attention in April when conservatives from across the country, including Trump, urged Gov. Jim Pillen to usher a bill through the Legislature to reinstate the state winner system. The effort didn't have the votes, but the possibility of Pillen calling a special session to push it through still hangs in the air.\n\nBefore Biden dropped out of the race, the campaign tapped Nebraska organizers Precious McKesson and Meg Mandy to serve as senior advisers in the state. Since Harris' candidacy announcement in July, her campaign has spent more than $1.3 million in ad reservations in Omaha area television stations, while Trump advertisements haven't aired since January, according to Federal Communication Commission political files.\n\nBut the Trump campaign has also been fired up.\n\nLast month, the campaign opened an Omaha field office holding numerous phone banks and door-knocking events.\n\nRepublican National Convention chair Michael Whatley recently visited the district during the Protect the Vote tour, which focused on election integrity. Attendees received poll observation training. Although there were no known instances of voter fraud during the last presidential election in Nebraska, Whatley says this is to help restore faith in Republican voters who don't think their votes count.\n\n\"We are going to live in seven, eight, 10 battleground states, and there's two congressional districts we really need to pay attention to, one up in Maine and this little place in Nebraska,\" Whatley said to the crowd.\n\nThe presidential election isn't the only competitive race in Nebraska's 2nd District. Rep. Don Bacon, who touts himself as one of the most moderate Republicans in Congress, is facing a second challenge from Democratic state Sen. Tony Vargas.\n\nBacon first beat Vargas in 2022 by nearly 3 points, but national Democrats are still eying the race as one that could help them flip the House in November. For months, polling has swayed back and forth between the candidates, but the Cook Political Report recently changed it from Republican-leaning to a toss-up. Both candidates are raking in millions in campaign funding and hope that a presidential election year will boost voter turnout for either candidate.\n\nBut in a deeply moderate district where both candidates don't stray too far from the center, Bacon expressed concern that the Republican presidential candidate might put off some independent and nonpartisan voters.\n\n\"It's hard to overcome if the top of the ticket is significantly behind,\" Bacon said. \"I'd sure like to have our nominee former President Trump, focus on the issues, personality attacks that doesn't play well in our district, or just the name-calling does not play well in suburban USA, particularly in the Midwest.\"\n\nThe Walz effect\n\nBesides its unique electoral system, Nebraska has drawn attention for another reason: It's the home state of Democratic VP pick Tim Walz, which the Harris campaign hopes will give it an edge.\n\nHis first campaign stop as Harris' pick was Omaha, where he showcased his Nebraska connections with a slew of state-specific references, slamming Trump's minimal connections to the state.\n\n\"Here in Nebraska, we have a slogan: 'Nebraska, it's not for everyone.' Well, it sure isn't for Donald Trump, I'll tell you that,\" Walz said.\n\nRaised in rural small towns across the state, including West Point, Butte and Valentine, Walz spent most of his life in Nebraska. He attended Chadron State College, served in the Nebraska Army National Guard and taught in Alliance, where he met his wife, Gwen.\n\nNebraska Democratic Party Chair Jane Kleeb says the Minnesota governor's Midwest roots and folksy charm are refreshing for voters who want to see everyday people in power.\n\n\"There's this sense that we don't have to hand him a briefing book. We don't have to hand him a Carhartt T-shirt. He automatically gets that,\" Kleeb said. \"It's part of who he is, and that will make a big shift, not only in CD-2, which, of course, has a rural county attached to it, but it'll make a difference across the state and in some of our down-ballot races.\"\n\nThe Minnesota governor's candidacy isn't the only way the Midwest has taken center stage this election.\n\nTrump's vice presidential pick, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, also hails from the Midwest. Last month, Vance visited Nebraska for a private fundraiser in Omaha and met with supporters.\n\nRandy Adkins, a professor of political science at the University of Nebraska-Omaha, says the campaign's pick of Walz will bode well for its chances in the 2nd District, especially among nonpartisan and moderate voters.\n\n\"I'm not saying that Republicans have turned around to vote for Harris because of Tim Walz, it's just somebody recognizing the kind of values, the plainspokenness, the Midwestern values that when they see from somebody in this part of the country, I think is well recognized. Issues and positions set aside, I think that's playing very well here.\"\n\nBut Bacon, who knows the district's centrist nature all too well, says Walz's Nebraska roots won't sway the area's voters as much as people think, pointing to his policy record as Minnesota's governor.\n\n\"I feel lucky that the Democrats didn't pick Shapiro. I think he would have been much more effective in my swing district,\" Bacon said. \"The policy stuff, I don't think will play well from Tim Walz in our district. The fact he has some Nebraska roots I think was initially a plus. But we start focusing on policy issues and they're too far left of center.\"\n\nRyan Wilkins, who helps run the Blue Dot Energy Facebook page, is excited to see a Nebraskan on the ballot and believes it's contributing to what he views as one of the most energized campaigns he has ever seen in the district.\n\n\"To me, it was just a massive release, like a weight fell off my shoulder, just the weight I carry as an American citizen and as a dad who wants this country to be a democracy for my daughters,\" Wilkins said. \"I'm well aware that there's a scenario in which my hometown could be a tipping point in this race, and not even an inconceivable scenario.\"",

        "text": "Trump\u2019s own version of reality continues to confound political actors and observers\nTrump\u2019s own version of reality continues to confound political actors and observers\n\ntoggle caption Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nEight years ago this month, Donald Trump announced that he had personally laid to rest the controversy about President Obama\u2019s country of origin. He gave himself credit for clearing up any questions that may have arisen because of something, he claimed, Hillary Clinton had said years earlier.\n\nThose familiar with the facts were stunned. They knew the so-called birther conspiracy had been hatched by various Obama opponents to suggest he was ineligible to be president because he had been born not in the U.S. but in Kenya or some other country. It had been kept alive and promoted for years by a variety of Obama critics, including, most prominently, Donald Trump.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIt could even be said that Trump had facilitated his transition from TV reality show star (The Apprentice and The Celebrity Apprentice) to bona fide political candidate by exploiting the birther myth.\n\nWhat Trump was actually announcing in September 2016 was a decision to stop talking about a non-issue he himself had helped sustain for years. But in finally renouncing one falsehood, he insisted on substituting another \u2014 casting himself as a hero of the tale.\n\nNearly a decade after Trump began running for president we should all be accustomed to his reliance on falsehoods.\n\nBut back in 2016, the birther flip-flop seemed to deserve special recognition. It was not just blatant, it was preposterous.\n\nOr so we thought. Surely it would diminish the man even in the eyes of his admirers. And it may have done so, in some cases. But it did not alter his trajectory. He stunned the world a few weeks later by winning the Electoral College vote for president.\n\nIt was said in the early Trump years that the media took him literally but not seriously. It\u2019s hard to deny that many of us took him too literally and not seriously enough. At the same time, many of Trump\u2019s \u201cbase\u201d voters were said to take Trump seriously but not literally. That worked for him, and those attitudes surely persist in 2024 much as they did in his first two campaigns.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nTen years ago, the media were accustomed to politicians who could be shamed or at least embarrassed over errors of fact and even minor exposures of ignorance. Trump seemed then, and still seems now, quite impervious to either.\n\nStill, the most egregious trait of Trump\u2019s campaign was his willingness to state highly consequential claims that were entirely at odds with reality, standing by them when challenged and sailing on \u2014 dismissive or seemingly oblivious to all criticism.\n\ntoggle caption Mark Ralston/AFP via Getty Images\n\nFar from being disqualifying, this feature of the Trump persona presents itself as part and parcel of his appeal.\n\n\n\nGiving truth the Trump treatment\n\nThis week, after a debate with Vice President Harris that he apparently did not take entirely seriously, Trump said he would not debate her again. He said there was no need for a \u201cthird debate\u201d because he had clearly won the first two. He was including the June 27 debate he had with President Biden, who had been the presumptive Democratic nominee at the time.\n\nPerhaps that was not surprising, as Trump kept Biden in his sights throughout his debate with Harris this week \u2014 name checking Biden repeatedly without naming Harris once.\n\nBut what was surprising was Trump\u2019s claim to having won both debates. Few would question he won the June 27 meeting with Biden , who seemed so diminished as to be hard to recognize.\n\nBut quite the opposite impression prevailed after Trump\u2019s match with Harris, who had swept to the Democratic nomination without opposition after Biden\u2019s July 18 decision to withdraw.\n\nThe first CNN polls after Tuesday\u2019s debate showed nearly two-thirds of those who watched thought Harris did better than Trump (even if they were not planning to vote for her). A sizable fraction of Republicans were not willing to say Trump had won the faceoff.\n\nYet here was Trump, on the afternoon after the debate, telling reporters he was not interested in a rematch with Harris because he had \u201cwon the debate according to every poll \u2014 every single poll, I think.\u201d\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIn fact, the only polls where Trump won were online polls of self-selected website samples rather than the randomized scientific samples actual pollsters use. One poll Trump cited had him winning 98% to 2%, according to Trump.\n\nMeanwhile, actual polling organizations such as Reuters and YouGov had done their soundings and found Harris the winner in the eyes of a clear majority \u2014 though not as large a majority as CNN\u2019s poll. Trump came out on top for just 31% of the respondents in YouGov and 24% in Reuters.\n\nThis willingness or compulsion to present claims that are utterly counterfactual has set Trump apart from conventional candidates. It continues to pose a problem for the media and the political community alike \u2014 including conservative media such as Fox News and a sizable portion of the Republican Party itself.\n\nTrump\u2019s claims are often expressed in hyperbolic superlatives. Trump insists he had \u201cthe best economy\u201d and Biden had \u201cthe worst inflation\u201d ever \u2014 two statements that are easily disproven. The nation\u2019s economic growth was stronger for longer under Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton, just to name two relatively recent presidents. Inflation was far higher and more sustained in the late 1970s and early 1980s.\n\nBut Trump has never been troubled by making such outlandish statements. Moreover, he is rarely satisfied with telling his crowds that yellow is green. It has to be the greenest green there has ever been. It is not sufficient to say up is down, it must be down farther than down has ever been.\n\nThe escalating statement of the stupendous is also a specialty. Take, for example, his casual references to the number of immigrants present in the United States illegally. On Tuesday night he started referring to millions, mentioned 21 million, then said it was surely far more than the official government estimate of 11 million . Then he again said it was more like 21 million before adding he thought the figure was \u201ca lot higher than\u201d that.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAnd all this without a shred of actual evidence or even a hint at the source of these wildly disparate numbers.\n\ntoggle caption Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nIn the June 27 debate against Biden, the incumbent\u2019s stumbles overshadowed Trump\u2019s own missteps. But Trump still had his share of howlers. At one point he said illegal immigrants had taken \u201c110%\u201d of all the jobs created during the Biden presidency.\n\nThat would mean they had taken more jobs than were created, strongly suggesting Trump was not paying much attention to what he was saying. Indeed, as a general rule when he starts spouting statistics, he seems far more interested in what shock they may cause than whether they add up.\n\nThere may have been a time this kind of behavior could be dismissed as ordinary political rhetoric, which most Americans expect will contain exaggerations and oversimplifications. It is clear from the polls that whatever Americans think of Trump\u2018s relationship to fact, something approaching half of them still plan to vote for him.\n\n\n\nThe challenge of fact-checking\n\nFact-checking has been around for more than a generation, giving newspapers and magazines a chance to offer something different and escape the \u201che said, she said\u201d pattern. In the later decades of the 20th century, most newspapers and big broadcasters were steeped in the values of \u201cmiddle of the road\u201d reporting as media owners sought ever-larger and more diverse audiences.\n\nStories were considered balanced when different sides were presented with equal weight and respect. Deciding which side was right or more accurate or more worthy was left to the news consumer or voter.\n\nThat was never entirely satisfactory, either to the consumer-voter or to the journalists themselves. More and more news outlets turned to \u201cfact-checks\u201d or \u201cfact-checking,\u201d an effort to find and follow the facts on crime, unemployment, trade, health care, immigration and any other issues that drove the debate.\n\nFor some journalists this became a full-time assignment. The Washington Post has used veteran reporter Glenn Kessler as its official guru of fact for many years. The Poynter Institute in Florida, related to the St. Petersburg Times (now the Tampa Bay Times) pioneered Politifact several election cycles ago.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nNPR and PBS have been fact-checking debates and other key moments in national campaigns for decades, online and on air. This week, the fact-checking operation in both shops had its hands full.\n\nSo when ABC moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis made a few factual corrections during the debate about a particular claim or statement, they were carrying on a custom that has been increasingly common in broadcast journalism.\n\nAs they did not see a need to correct as much in what Harris said, their efforts struck many Trump supporters as unnecessary, unfair and evidence of Democratic bias. Trump himself said the debate had been \u201c3 against 1.\u201d\n\nThe anchors\u2019 defense was that Harris said nothing to compare with Trump\u2019s assertions about states allowing abortion after birth or Haitian immigrants eating people\u2019s pets in Ohio .\n\nThat\u2019s a judgment call, of course, and just the kind that mainstream journalists were once trained to avoid. That they now feel compelled to make those calls has a lot to do with how Trump himself has changed the rules. But it should not be surprising that changes the media have made prompt protest from those who feel abused \u2014 particularly Trump himself.\n\nThis entails also the sea change over the use of the three-letter word we were trained as journalists to avoid: lie. We might say a politician was misstating facts or making inaccurate claims. But we could never make the leap of imputing motive. Maybe the pol was just mistaken and sincerely believed his opponent was guilty of this or that accusation. We could say he was wrong, but calling someone a liar was a big deal.\n\nTrump has led to a change in that policy in much of the industry. Even in 2016, some TV anchors were using the word, at least on late-night TV. It has since become quite common for mainstream news organizations to refer to lies and lying.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nWith his latest portrayal of what happened in the Harris debate in front of 67 million TV viewers this week, Trump once again has thrown down the gauntlet to challenge the fact-checkers and the commentators alike.\n\nNow, even the practice of fact-checking has become controversial, with Trump acolytes questioning what constitutes a fact. We have reached a point where the idea of fact-checking is regarded as polarizing.\n\nAnd the more we talk about how polarized things have become, the more polarized they get.",

        "text": "Harris regains small poll lead post-debate as US election inches closer\nKamala Harris has re-established a crucial polling advantage over Donald Trump following this week\u2019s debate, which a clear majority of voters believe she won, according to a range of surveys.\n\nThe latest Guardian polling trends tracker shows the US vice-president regaining a small lead over the Republican nominee since Tuesday\u2019s encounter in Philadelphia, a shift from surveys at the start of the week when the pair were essentially tied.\n\nThe movement is supported by individual polls, some of which show Harris with a bigger lead than the 0.9% advantage displayed in the Guardian tracker.\n\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll, the first to be conducted since the debate, had Harris ahead by five points, 47 to 42%, a 1-point rise on the lead recorded in the week after last month\u2019s Democratic national convention.\n\nA separate Morning Consult survey published on Thursday showed a similar lead, 50 to 45%, up from the three- to four-point advantage Harris was registering before the debate. Tellingly, the poll reflected a loss of support for Trump, perhaps supporting some pollsters\u2019 argument that his erratic performance in Tuesday\u2019s encounter \u2013 which was watched by 67.1 million viewers \u2013 damaged his credibility.\n\nTwo other polls by YouGov and Leger give Harris a four- and three-point lead respectively. Generally, the post-debate polls present a rosier outlook for the vice-president than surveys beforehand, which suggested that the surge in popularity she experienced after replacing Joe Biden as the Democrats\u2019 nominee had stalled, allowing Trump to draw close to even in national polls, and even edge ahead in one New York Times/Siena survey.\n\nAll available indicators suggest that the turnaround has been triggered by the events of the debate, where Harris was broadly seen as cutting a calm, controlled figure while getting under the skin of Trump \u2013 who repeatedly veered off policy message to go on wild tangents about immigrants and crowd sizes at his rallies.\n\nWhile so far declining Harris\u2019s challenge of a second debate, the former president nevertheless claims that he won the exchange.\n\nSurvey respondents beg to differ. The Reuters/Ipsos polls showed 53% who had heard something about the encounter believed that Harris had come out on top, as opposed to 24% thinking Trump had prevailed. The Morning Consult poll showed a similar margin, 55-25%, in favour of thinking Harris had won.\n\nThat is broadly in line with three earlier post-debate polls \u2013 conducted by CNN, YouGov and CNN \u2013 which gave Harris an average debate-winning margin of 23%.\n\n\u201cShe definitely got a bump \u2013 and if those polls are accurate, a little more of a bump than I thought,\u201d said John Zogby, a veteran pollster who believes key moments in some debates had small but decisive impacts on the outcomes of past presidential elections.\n\n\u201cClearly Kamala Harris won the debate. There are enough polls out to show that and other observers beyond the polls also believe that she won. I think, more importantly, Trump lost the debate. He lost a lot of credibility, in addition to having lost the debate.\u201d\n\nThe burning question, however, is whether one lost debate translates into a lost election.\n\nFrank Luntz, a Republican pollster and strategist who forecast in advance of the debate that its winner would prevail in November, suggested that the sour nature of Trump\u2019s showing had sealed his electoral fate.\n\n\u201cIt was a pretty negative performance. Pretty pessimistic, cynical, contemptuous and I think that this will cost him, yes,\u201d he told the interviewer Piers Morgan. \u201cI think that he loses because of this debate performance.\u201d\n\nAlthough eight weeks separate Tuesday\u2019s debate from election day on 5 November, the wafer-thin polling margins \u2013 particularly in key battleground states \u2013 mean the ripples emanating from Trump\u2019s multiple miscues are likely to have an outsize effect, Luntz argued.\n\n\u201cThere are very few undecided voters left,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about 5% of the vote \u2013 and they only matter in seven states. And those states are too close to call. So essentially we are looking at less than 1% of America. But they heard nothing from Trump to give them a sense of anything that would be different going forward.\u201d\n\nZogby, by contrast, said it was \u201ctoo early to tell\u201d the debate\u2019s electoral impact and identified weaknesses in Harris\u2019s performance that may return to haunt her.\n\n\u201cShe lost some points on substance,\u201d he said. \u201cRight from the very beginning [when she was asked] can you tell the American people that they\u2019re better off than they were three and a half years ago \u2026 she jumped right into the future. That\u2019s going to dog her because three-quarters of the US voters think the country is headed in the wrong direction \u2013 and the blame goes to the party on top and the president on top. She owns the administration\u2019s successes, but she also owns inflation and the economy.\n\n\u201cSo I will say advantage to her on presentation and being cool, but there was no knockout blow.\u201d\n\nOne additional piece of fallout from Tuesday\u2019s debate might tilt the balance in Harris\u2019s direction \u2013 the intervention of Taylor Swift.\n\nThe singer endorsed Harris immediately after the event, a move that prompted about 400,000 people to visit a voter registration link she posted on her Instagram, which has 284 million followers.\n\nA late young voter registration surge favouring the Democrats could significantly affect the electoral role played by the age 18-29 voter demographic, among which Harris\u2019s current 15% lead over Trump compares unfavourably with the 28% advantage Biden held in his 2020 election victory.\n\nIn a segment on CNN, Harry Enten, the network\u2019s polling specialist, illustrated a trend towards Republican registration among voters under 30 in battleground states that are key to winning the White House.\n\nIn Pennsylvania and North Carolina, two fiercely contested swing states, the GOP had drastically whittled back the Democrats\u2019 lead among young voters of four years ago, thanks to a superior registration drive, he said, the effect of which Harris could only hope Swift\u2019s endorsement could reverse.\n\n\u201cKamala Harris will absolutely welcome in the support of Taylor Swift if she can move young voters at all,\u201d Enten said. \u201cThe bottom line is [Harris] is not doing as well among young voters as you might expect the Democrat to necessarily be doing, based upon history.\u201d\n\nRead more about the 2024 US election:",

American astronauts have been voting from space since 1997 when the Texas legislature passed a bill allowing NASA employees to vote from space, New York Post reported .",
        "text": "Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore to vote from space for the 2024 U.S. presidential election\nStranded on the International Space Station through February, NASA astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore plan to vote in the November 5 U.S. presidential election from space.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very important duty that we have as citizens and (I am) looking forward to being able to vote from space, which is pretty cool,\u201d Ms. Williams, who is of Indian origin, said on a call with reporters on Friday (September 12, 2024) afternoon.\n\nMs. Williams, 58, and Wilmore, 61, participated in a press conference on Friday (September 12, 2024) from the International Space Station (ISS), which has been their home since June. Their Boeing Starliner spacecraft ran into several problems mid-flight and could not bring them home from a planned 8-day voyage.\n\n\u201cI sent down my request for a ballot today,\u201d Mr. Wilmore said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very important role that we play as citizens including those elections, and NASA makes it very easy for us to do that,\u201d he said. They, however, did not indicate which presidential candidate \u2013 either former President Donald Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris \u2013 would get their vote.\n\nAmerican astronauts have been voting from space since 1997 when the Texas legislature passed a bill allowing NASA employees to vote from space, New York Post reported. That year, NASA astronaut David Wolf became the first American to vote from space on the Mir Space Station. In 2020, NASA astronaut Kate Rubins also performed her civic duty from space on the ISS.\n\nElection officials in Harris County, Texas \u2013 where NASA\u2019s Johnson Space Station is located \u2013 told NBC News that they work with NASA to send astronauts a PDF with clickable boxes to make their choices. The PDF is password-protected to ensure a secret ballot.\n\nFriday\u2019s (September 12, 2024) press conference came exactly one week after the Starliner returned to Earth \u2013 without its crew \u2013 to make room on the space station for SpaceX\u2019s Crew Dragon, which is now due to bring the two astronauts\u2019 home in February.\n\nMs. Williams and Wilmore are living on the ISS with seven other astronauts. They said they feel \u201cgrateful\u201d to spend more time in space, despite difficulties.\n\nWhen asked if it was difficult to see the Starliner leave without them, Ms. Williams said they were tasked with ensuring it left the ISS safely. \u201cWe were watching our spaceship fly away,\u201d she said.\n\nMs. Williams said as she and Mr. Wilmore used to work in the Navy, they are \u201cnot surprised when deployments get changed. It\u2019s risky and that\u2019s how it goes in the business,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen asked if they feel let down by NASA and Boeing, Mr. Wilmore said, \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d Pointing to Ms. William\u2019s t-shirt with a NASA logo, he said: \u201cThat represents something that we stand for as an agency \u2013 we go beyond, we do things that are out of the ordinary. This is not easy,\u201d he added. He said that 90% of their astronaut training is about preparing for \u201cthe unexpected\u201d.\n\nMs. Williams, who has just been named the commander of the International Space Station, said she was in good spirits.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here with our friends, we\u2019ve got a ride home,\u201d she said, adding that she is looking forward to the next couple of months on board the ISS.",

        "text": "Do vice-presidential candidates matter? Voters say JD Vance, Tim Walz make a difference\nRhonda Woods is a 71-year-old retired nurse who has voted across party lines her entire life.\n\nShe cast ballots for Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush twice, Barack Obama, Donald Trump and Joe Biden. This year, she said, voting for Trump is not an option \u2212 something she felt even more sure about when the Republican presidential nominee tapped Ohio Sen. JD Vance as his running mate.\n\n\"I think it is important that we get somebody in office that can take over,\" said Woods, who lives in the battleground state of Michigan. \"It's kind of stupid to think that a vice president isn\u2019t important, right?\"\n\nMore:Who won the debate? Harris' forceful performance rattles a defensive Trump.\n\nVice presidential candidates have often been seen as understudies, silver medalists or the forgotten middle child. This year could be different. Voters like Woods say they are indeed paying close attention to Vance and his Democratic rival, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, during this truncated general election cycle as the candidates barnstorm the swing states.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nIt's a spotlight that is likely to intensify as their Oct. 1 debate approaches in New York City.\n\nRecent polling from USA TODAY and Suffolk University found that when pitted against one another, Walz is more favored than Vance. And while Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris will be atop the nation's presidential ballots and therefore top of mind for voters, observers say their running mates could help tip the scales in an election that may come down to the narrowest of margins in any one critical battleground.\n\nInterest in this year's vice presidential candidates has been top of mind for much of the campaign cycle. The COVID pandemic, the ages of both Biden (81) and Trump (78) and the assassination attempt against the former Republican president serve as stark reminders that every chief executive needs a capable No. 2, just in case.\n\n\"I think they matter, but on the margins,\" said University of Dayton professor Christopher Devine, who's studied the impact of vice presidential candidates. \"If this is an election decided on the margins, we could look back and say that was consequential.\"\n\nVP resumes, gaffes dominate headlines\n\nFor both VP candidates, the attention hasn't slowed down since they each secured their party's nomination this summer.\n\nReporting by the Associated Press and New York Times highlighted Vance's connections to the people behind the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025, a policy blueprint for a future Republican administration which both the Ohio senator and Trump have sought to distance themselves from. Harris' campaign resurfaced Vance's past remarks about women and families, including his criticism of \"childless cat ladies\" and suggestion that women who focus on their careers are on a \"path to misery.\"\n\nDemocrats have accused Vance of fixating on childlessness. It's literally part of what first inspired Walz to brand Vance as \"weird\" before Harris had even picked the governor as her running mate. Vance's debut also invoked comparisons to Sarah Palin, the little-known former Alaska GOP governor who some believe cost John McCain the presidency in 2008 for her tendency to invite scandal and go rogue once she'd made the national spotlight as his running mate.\n\n\"That kind of s---'s just bizarre, and that could peel away some Republicans,\" said Chris Redfern, former chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party. \"You're not going to gain Republican support from JD Vance, but you could certainly lose thousands of votes in a state like Michigan.\"\n\nMore:'He seems real to me': Tim Walz leads JD Vance on favorability in exclusive poll\n\nCriticism of Vance isn't limited to his policy ideas. Social media users have been quick to mock his interactions on the campaign trail, including an awkward stop at a Georgia donut shop that went viral. But allies of Vance and Trump say they've been impressed with the Ohio senator's media savvy and willingness to face his detractors head on.\n\nWalz, meanwhile, has received renewed scrutiny for his resume as governor and congressman.\n\nGOP leaders have attacked Walz's progressive policy actions as governor, such as making menstrual products available in boys' and girls' school bathrooms and protecting reproductive rights. Vance went after Walz's military record and accused the governor of stolen valor, which angered some veterans and Republicans alike.\n\nWalz's response to the violence following the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, as well as his administration\u2019s oversight of the nation's largest pandemic fraud scheme, has painted a complicated picture of his actions during his tenure as governor and whether he\u2019s fit to serve as No. 2.\n\nWalz and his administration's responses to his actions during the civil unrest in 2020 have remained vague. A public records non-profit recently sued the Minnesota Department of Public Safety (DPS) for information and transcripts of interviews done with Walz's staff and possibly himself to learn more about how the administration handled the violence that resulted in an estimated $2 billion in damages. The non-profit requested a jury trial and is waiting for an answer from the state.\n\nWhat do voters think of Vance, Walz?\n\nWill the good, bad and ugly publicity be enough to sway voters? Trump in one recent interview said he doesn't seem to think so.\n\n\"Historically, the choice of a vice president makes no difference,\" Trump said during the National Association of Black Journalists Conference in July. \"You're voting for the president. You can have a vice president who's outstanding in every way, and I think JD is. I think that all of them would have been. But you're not voting that way. You're voting for the president, you're voting for me.\"\n\nWashington state resident and lawyer Erik Thacker, 35, disagrees. He believes vice presidential picks matter, and they were a part of why he voted for Biden in 2020. Thacker saw Harris as a more progressive version of Biden, who he described as an \"establishment Democrat\" to USA TODAY.\n\n\"I was like, 'I'm on board with this,' (picking her as running mate) made me more likely to vote for him,\" he said.\n\nThacker, a self-described independent, voted for Obama, then Mitt Romney, in 2016 he wrote in a third-party candidate, and in 2020 he voted for Biden.\n\n\"When I was younger, I sort of thought VPs didn\u2019t really do anything at all,\" Thacker said. \"I do feel like they've taken on more responsibility, we've at least sort of increased scrutiny of them in the public eye. I think we\u2019re talking about them more.\"\n\nThacker said he'll vote for Harris this year. Choosing Walz as her running mate wasn't necessarily the deciding factor, but a solidification that Thacker is making the right choice for himself.\n\n\"I like a fair amount of Walz\u2019s policies from Minnesota,\" he said. \u201cI thought (his picking) was a little bit of signal that (Harris) might be breaking from the more centrist administration of Joe Biden.\"\n\nRepublican Roxanne Hoben is also heartened by her preferred candidate's running mate. The 55-year-old Pennsylvania resident was all in on Trump from the beginning \u2212 and she initially hoped the former president would choose South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott as his No. 2. But the more she learns about Vance, the more she likes.\n\n\"I like that he was in the Marines,\" Hoben said. \"He has that disciplined mindset about him. I think he has family, God and country foremost in his mind, so that's a big plus. He\u2019s very personable. I could listen to him for hours. He doesn't get on my nerves, if you know what I mean.\"\n\nMore:Donald Trump missteps stir growing Republican worry, campaign seeks Vance reset\n\nWhile Trump's choice ultimately didn't affect her decision for November, Hoben said the assassination attempt against him in July underscored the need for him to choose the right running mate.\n\n\"If he would've had his head turned slightly more, he would've been gone,\" she said. \"You\u2019re going to need somebody who's going to step right into his shoes.\"\n\nWoods, the retired nurse, isn't sold on either vice presidential pick yet. Vance is just a younger Trump, she told USA TODAY, \"worse in a way.\"\n\nOn the flip side, Walz being \"one heartbeat away from being president of the United States\" isn't reassuring to her either.\n\n\"Walz is a nice guy,\" Woods said. \"Can I see him being president? I don\u2019t know.\"\n\nSam Woodward is the Minnesota elections reporting fellow for USA TODAY focusing on Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz's candidacy.

        "text": "WATCH: Trump appears at campaign rally in Las Vegas\nFormer President Donald Trump took the stage at a campaign rally in Las Vegas, Nevada on Friday night, where he repeated complaints he made earlier about Tuesday\u2019s presidential debate and attacked Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nWatch Trump\u2019s remarks in the player above.\n\nTrump focused especially on migration into the U.S. and said he wanted to be known as \u201cMr. Border President.\u201d\n\nIn the border state of Arizona, Trump on Thursday pitched a tax exemption on all overtime wages, adding it to his previous proposals to not tax tips or Social Security income. But the former president squeezed those proposals, along with a nonspecific pledge to lower housing costs, into a stemwinding speech marked by his most incendiary rhetoric on immigration and immigrants themselves, name-calling of Harris and others, and a dark, exaggerated portrait of a nation Trump insisted is in a freefall only he can reverse.\n\nWATCH: Trump appears at campaign rally in Tucson, first since debate with Harris\n\n\u201cI was angry at the debate,\u201d Trump said, mocking commentators\u2019 description of his performance Tuesday. \u201cAnd, yes, I am angry,\u201d he said, because \u201ceverything is terrible\u201d since Harris and President Joe Biden are \u201cdestroying our country.\u201d As he repeated the word \u201cangry,\u201d Trump\u2019s crowd in Tucson answered with its own \u201cUSA! USA! USA!\u201d chants.\n\nThe competing visions and narratives underscored the starkly different choices faced by voters in the battleground states that will decide the outcome. Harris is casting a wide net, depending on Democrats\u2019 diverse coalition and hoping to add moderate and even conservative Republicans repelled by the former president. Trump, while seeking a broad working-class coalition with his tax ideas, is digging in on arguments about the country \u2014 and his political opponents \u2014 that are aimed most squarely at his most strident supporters.\n\nThat could become a consistent frame for the closing stretch of the campaign after Trump shut the door on another debate. That potentially could have been another seminal moment during a year that already has boomeranged around milestones like Trump\u2019s criminal conviction by a New York jury, Trump surviving an assassination attempt, Biden ending his reelection bid amid questions about his age, and Harris consolidating Democratic support to become the first woman of color to lead a major-party ticket.\n\n\u201cThere will be no third debate,\u201d Trump said Thursday, counting his June matchup against Biden in the total, and insisting he had won his lone encounter with Harris on Tuesday in Philadelphia.\n\nThe post-debate blitz reflected the narrow path to 270 Electoral College votes for both candidates, with the campaign already having become concentrated on seven swing states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.",

This election could mark a significant turning point in American politics.On one side, Democratic candidate Kamala Harris , former Vice President to Joe Biden, appears to have a strong following. On the other side, Republican candidate Donald Trump , the 45th President, is making waves as he launches his fourth campaign for the presidency.While both candidates are dominating headlines as the November 5th election draws near, recent developments have stirred even more excitement. Pop star Taylor Swift 's endorsement of Kamala Harris following a major debate may have given the Democratic candidate an edge. However, Donald Trump is no stranger to high-profile supporters either, with a number of celebrities openly backing him.Elon Musk, the billionaire entrepreneur, has been vocal in his support for Donald Trump. Musk frequently takes to X (formerly known as Twitter) to express his views, often sparking controversy. Recently, after Taylor Swift's endorsement of Kamala Harris, Musk responded sarcastically on X, making headlines for his crude and unexpected comments. Despite the backlash, his loyalty to Trump remains steadfast.Brittany Mahomes, the American soccer player, has stirred speculation about her political stance. Although she hasn\u2019t openly endorsed Trump, she sparked controversy by reportedly liking one of his Instagram posts.Despite quickly retracting the action, Trump took notice and even gave her a public shoutout on multiple occasions. Her stance remains unclear, but her actions have fuelled public curiosity.Controversial rapper Azealia Banks has once again thrown her support behind Donald Trump, as she did in the 2016 elections. Despite withdrawing her initial endorsement back then, Banks has returned to the Trump camp in 2024. She has made appearances at Trump rallies and voiced her support, particularly on issues related to gun laws.Rapper Lil Wayne has had a unique relationship with Donald Trump since receiving a presidential pardon from him in 2021. The pardon, granted during Trump\u2019s final night in office, was for a firearm possession charge. Wayne publicly thanked Trump, and the two have since discussed criminal justice reforms. The rapper remains a loyal supporter.Oscar-winning actor Jon Voight has been one of Trump\u2019s most vocal celebrity supporters for years. Voight, who refers to Trump as the \"greatest president since Abraham Lincoln,\" has consistently praised the former president's policies. His support for Trump dates back to the start of Trump's political career, and he remains a steadfast advocate of the MAGA movement.As America approaches its pivotal election day, both candidates are counting on endorsements and public support to tip the scales. Only time will tell who will emerge victorious in this closely contested race.The Biden-Harris campaign criticized Amber Rose for endorsing Donald Trump at the Republican National Convention. Rose claimed the media lied about Trump, including portraying him as a racist, and stated that his supporters accept people regardless of race or identity. She expressed her belief that Trump is where she belongs.",

Darroch\u2019s position became untenable after Boris Johnson, then involved in the Tory leadership contest to succeed Theresa May, failed to give the ambassador his unequivocal backing.\n\nDarroch, who remains a respected figure in diplomatic circles on both sides of the Atlantic, says Trump is now \u201ca less formidable campaigner\u201d than in 2016, \u201cdown on energy, more liable to become confused, with a mind cluttered with grievances. And he remains a policy-free zone.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Observed Free weekly newsletter Analysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Urging Harris to be \u201claser-focused\u201d on voters in the key swing states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin won by Biden in 2020, Darroch warns that they may drift back to Trump unless Harris is able to offer \u201csome crisply worded, specific, targeted policies to bring jobs and hope back to these blighted neighbourhoods\u201d.\n\nThe second error is that Harris appears to be hiding from the media, repeating a mistake made by Hillary Clinton. \u201cBack in 2016, Trump was ever-present. He would accept any and every invitation. He would even, unbidden, phone the morning news shows to offer his views on the day\u2019s issues. By contrast, Hillary Clinton locked the media out \u2013 and lost.\u201d\n\nHarris, he claims \u201cseems to have adopted the Clinton playbook\u201d.\n\nView image in fullscreen UK prime minister Keir Starmer has been advised to meet Donald Trump\u2019s team by former British ambassador to the US Kim Darroch. Photograph: Mike Egerton/PA\n\nDarroch says the UK embassy in Washington will no doubt be advising Starmer to try to meet Trump, perhaps taking time out from a meeting of the UN general assembly this week to do so.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot to discuss with him, starting with his views on Ukraine. And however badly Trump performed in the debate, however visible his personal decline, he remains for many of us the likelier winner.\u201d Last week, Starmer\u2019s former pollster Deborah Mattinson met Harris\u2019s campaign team in Washington to share details of how Labour pulled off its stunning election win by targeting key groups of \u201csqueezed working-class voters who wanted change\u201d, further strengthening contacts with the Democratic side.",

But several said they had not heard of the group or its activities, and some had never heard of Routh.\n\nAll claimed they did not know how their names and contact information had been shared on the pro-Taiwan website.\n\nUnlike Ukraine, Taiwan does not have an official foreign legion. Taiwan\u2019s Foreign Ministry and Defense Ministry declined to comment on Routh.\n\nChina\u2019s ruling Communist Party says Taiwan is part of its territory, despite never having controlled it, and has vowed to take the island by force if necessary.\n\nThe US is bound by law to supply the self-governing island with weapons to defend itself, and support for Taiwan is a rare issue of broadly bipartisan consensus in Washington.",

And Harris leads with women 53% to 36%.\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2024, Des Moines Register and Tribune Co.\n\nKamala Harris has significantly narrowed the presidential race in Iowa, cutting Donald Trump\u2019s lead to 4 percentage points in a dramatic turnaround from Joe Biden\u2019s double-digit deficit.\n\nA new Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll shows that Trump leads Vice President Harris 47% to 43% among likely Iowa voters \u2014 a far slimmer margin than the 18-point lead the former Republican president enjoyed over Democratic President Biden in late spring.\n\nBefore Biden ended his reelection campaign, a June Iowa Poll showed Trump leading 50% to 32%.\n\nThis is the Iowa Poll\u2019s first test of Harris\u2019 strength against Trump since she became the Democratic Party\u2019s presidential nominee in August.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say 4 points is comfortable\u201d for Trump, said pollster J. Ann Selzer, president of Selzer & Co. \u201cThe race has tightened significantly.\u201d\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr., who has abandoned his independent presidential campaign but will remain on the Iowa ballot, gets 6% of the vote. That\u2019s down from 9% in June.\n\nAnother 1% pick Libertarian presidential candidate Chase Oliver, 1% say they would vote for someone else and 1% are not sure.\n\nMore Iowa Poll:Trump favored for handling inflation, immigration; Harris for abortion, Iowa Poll finds\n\nThe poll puts the race more closely in line with the 2020 election results, which ultimately saw Trump win Iowa by about 8 percentage points over Biden.\n\nIt also shows a sharp divide between men and women likely voters \u2014 Trump leads with men 59% to 32% over Harris. And Harris leads with women 53% to 36%.\n\nSelzer said the poll findings \u201csignal a change in the mood of the electorate.\u201d\n\nNow, 81% of all Iowans say they will definitely vote in the general election, up from 76% in June. However, some of the demographic groups more likely to favor Harris are showing increased participation.\n\nWomen show an 8-percentage-point uptick in likely voting since June, Iowans younger than 45 show a 10-point increase, city dwellers show a 6-point bounce, and those with a college degree are up 9 points.\n\nEach of those groups gives plurality support to Kamala Harris.\n\n\u201cThis poll may be catching newly energized voters who thought they would sit out the election at the time our June poll was taken,\u201d Selzer said.\n\nLikely Iowa voters\u2019 opinions of the candidates are beginning to solidify, with greater shares saying their choice is firm.\n\nToday, 80% say their minds are made up, an increase from 67% in June. Another 18% say they could still be persuaded \u2014 down from 29%.\n\nAmong Harris supporters, 89% say their minds are made up; it\u2019s 84% among Trump supporters.\n\n\u201cThe race is locking in,\u201d Selzer said.\n\nThe Iowa Poll, conducted by Selzer & Co., surveyed 811 Iowans from Sept. 8-11. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.8 percentage points for questions asked of 656 likely voters and 3.4 percentage points for those asked of Iowa adults.\n\nMore:How is the Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll conducted? We answer your top questions.\n\n\u2018Younger, more with it\u2019: Enthusiasm for Kamala Harris tops excitement for Donald Trump\n\nFollowing the summer switch from Biden to Harris, enthusiasm among likely voters who support Harris outpaces enthusiasm among likely voters who support Trump.\n\nAccording to the poll, 80% of Harris\u2019 supporters say they are extremely or very enthusiastic about her as their choice for president \u2014 compared with 74% of Trump\u2019s supporters.\n\nPenny Williams, a 62-year-old Keokuk resident and poll respondent, said she is very enthusiastic about supporting Harris.\n\n\u201cShe's younger, more with it, more current and can reach the younger voters better,\u201d she said. \u201cThank you, Taylor Swift,\u201d she added, referencing the pop megastar\u2019s endorsement of Harris immediately following the Sept. 10 presidential debate.\n\nWilliams, a Democrat, said she thought Harris performed well during the debate, though she could have gone deeper on some issues.\n\n\u201cShe paid (Trump) back for all he did to Biden in the first one,\u201d she said. \u201cBiden, God bless him, he's the only one that could have beat Trump four years ago. But his time's done, so now it's hers.\u201d\n\nToday, 41% of Iowa adults approve of the way Harris is performing as vice president, about the same as the 42% who approved in June 2021, the last time the Iowa Poll tested her job approval.\n\nA slightly higher percentage of Iowans now disapprove of the way Harris is doing her job as vice president: 55% disapprove, up from 50% in June 2021. Another 3% are not sure.\n\nHarris is viewed favorably by 43% of Iowa adults and unfavorably by 54%, while 3% are not sure.\n\nThat\u2019s about on par with Trump, who is viewed favorably by 48% of Iowans and unfavorably by 51%, with another 2% who are not sure.\n\nIndependent Iowa voters lean toward Trump\n\nTrump and Harris each get strong majorities of support from their party bases.\n\nRepublican likely voters support Trump over Harris 94% to 2%. And likely Democratic voters support Harris over Trump 95% to 2%.\n\nIndependent voters lean toward Trump, with 41% supporting him and 36% supporting Harris.\n\nBut independent voters break on gender lines.\n\nIndependent men support Trump 46% to 33% over Harris, while independent women support Harris 40% to 35% over Trump.\n\nNick Finley, a 41-year-old Melcher resident and poll respondent, is an independent voter who plans to vote for the first time and to support Trump.\n\nHe said he\u2019s decided to cast a vote in this year\u2019s presidential race because he believes the justice system has been \u201crailroading Trump.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf they can do it to him, they can do it to anybody,\u201d he said.\n\nFinley said he appreciates Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d mentality and opposes U.S. involvement in \u201cuseless wars\u201d such as in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cHe seems more for the people,\u201d he said of Trump. \u201cI like to think he can make a little bit of change, but we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nTrump also performs best with likely voters who describe themselves as evangelical, as well as those who live in rural areas, while Harris\u2019 best groups are those with a college degree and suburban dwellers.\n\nHarris also leads Trump with the small group of suburban women who responded to the Iowa Poll \u2014 69% to 27%.\n\nMajorities of Iowans say they are worse off financially; nation is headed in the wrong direction\n\nAs the election nears, just 24% of Iowa adults believe the nation is headed in the right direction, while 69% believe it has gotten off on the wrong track. Another 7% are not sure.\n\nThat\u2019s an improvement from June, when 17% said the U.S. was headed in the right direction and 77% said the country was on the wrong track.\n\nNinety-five percent of Republicans say the nation is headed in the wrong direction, while 36% of Democrats and 72% of independents agree.\n\nMark Franks, a 51-year-old Cedar Rapids resident and poll respondent, is among those who believe things are headed in the wrong direction, largely because of illegal immigration and inflation, he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just getting hard to pay for everything,\u201d he said.\n\nFranks said he\u2019s not confident the situation will change, regardless of who is elected.\n\n\u201cThe problem is they don't have anybody who knows what the real people are going through,\u201d he said. \u201cI'm sorry, you've got a person that's been there for four years that hasn't really done nothing. You know, her and that Joe have not done nothing, really. And then you've got Trump, who's a billionaire or whatever he is. He doesn't know what the real people are really like \u2014 people who just live day to day.\u201d\n\nFranks said he\u2019s registered as a Republican, but he\u2019s still trying to decide who he\u2019ll vote for. He\u2019s leaning toward Trump and hopes the former president will cut government spending and inflation.\n\nFranks is also among the 46% of Iowans who say they are worse off financially today than they were four years ago. Just 21% say they are better off, while 31% say they are about the same.\n\nThe percentage of those who say they are worse off is the highest it\u2019s been in the eight times the Iowa Poll has asked the question. The previous high was in both January and November 2009 during the Great Recession, when 40% said they felt worse off than they had four years ago.\n\nBiden\u2019s approval rating remains low, although it has received a small bounce in the aftermath of his decision to end his reelection campaign \u2014 a decision widely praised by Democrats in Iowa and around the country.\n\nToday, 33% approve of the job he\u2019s doing as president, compared with 28% in June. Another 64% disapprove, down slightly from 67% over the summer. Another 3% are not sure.\n\nRepublicans\u2019 disapproval is nearly universal, with 97% saying they disapprove of the job he\u2019s doing, compared with 18% of Democrats.\n\nThe percentage of Iowans who view Biden favorably has held relatively steady. Today, 35% view him favorably and 63% hold an unfavorable view, while 1% are unsure.\n\nThat\u2019s compared with 33% who held favorable views and 66% who held unfavorable views in June.\n\nBrianne Pfannenstiel is the chief politics reporter for the Des Moines Register.

Interviewers with Quantel Research contacted households with randomly selected landline and cell phone numbers supplied by Dynata. Interviews were administered in English. Responses were adjusted by age, sex and congressional district to reflect the general population based on recent American Community Survey estimates.\n\nQuestions based on the sample of 811 Iowa adults have a maximum margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points. This means that if this survey were repeated using the same questions and the same methodology, 19 times out of 20, the findings would not vary from the true population value by more than plus or minus 3.4 percentage points. Results based on smaller samples of respondents\u2014such as by gender or age\u2014have a larger margin of error.\n\nRepublishing the copyright Iowa Poll without credit and, on digital platforms, links to originating content on The Des Moines Register and Mediacom is prohibited.",

        "text": "How do presidential elections affect the stock market?\nReady or not, Election Day is right around the corner. Most of the attention is on the candidates themselves, but investors also may find themselves wondering what the outcome may mean for the stock market \u2014 and, in turn, their portfolios.\n\nWhile there is no way to predict the future, history can still offer some helpful guidance and hopefully cool some nerves. Here is a look at what past election years have shown and how investors can navigate the uncertainty in the months ahead.\n\nDo elections really matter for the financial markets?\n\nPresidential elections \"can shift the nation's policies regarding foreign relations and domestic economic development,\" and as such, \"can cause significant volatility in the market as investors cope with uncertainty about the country's direction,\" said Forbes .\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Sign up\n\nThat said, \"the news-cycle volatility of election years has often had less impact on markets than voters might assume,\" said Fidelity . Instead, \"market moves are more likely to be driven by market and economic fundamentals, such as corporate earnings, interest rates and other economic factors,\" with effects from what is happening politically more likely to be short-term.\n\nWhat does past market performance tell us about the upcoming election?\n\n\"Of course \u2014 as always \u2014 there is one caveat: Past performance is no guarantee of future returns,\" said Forbes. With that in mind, here is what history has shown us in regards to the presidential election's impact on the market in years past:\n\nThe markets do not necessarily favor one party over the other. \"Although popular myths sometimes suggest that one party or the other is 'better' for market returns, the historical data does not bear out these theories,\" said Fidelity. Indeed, \"the S&P 500 has historically averaged positive returns under nearly every partisan combination.\"\n\nDown-ballot races are worth paying attention to. While many people are focused on who wins the presidency, down-ballot races for Congress can have a major impact as well, as they \"will help determine whether the next two years are spent under divided or unified government, and will likely impact how much of its agenda the next administration is able to accomplish,\" said Fidelity. Still, those results are not determinative \u2014 \"it seems that even when Congress is controlled by the opposition party (which makes it more difficult for a president to pursue an agenda), markets tend to react in ways similar to when there is a unified government,\" said Investopedia .\n\nThe overall effects of the election on the market are not significant. \"Historical data highlights the minimal long-term effects of elections on market performance, with the S&P 500 showing resilience and positive returns regardless of the electoral cycle,\" said Kiplinger . As further evidence of this, \"Vanguard research dating to 1860 finds no statistical relationship between the performance of a 60% equity/40% bond portfolio in presidential election and non-election years,\" said Vanguard .\n\nHow can investors weather election season?\n\nIf the news cycle has you biting your nails and constantly checking your portfolio, here are some tips to keep in mind as an investor this election season:\n\nAvoid making any big bets. While it may seem tempting to make bets based on \"specific policy or sector impacts,\" said Fidelity, \"the reality is that at this stage no one can predict with any certainty which party will win certain institutions, let alone what sectors, industries or stocks may benefit from the next administration's policies.\" Instead, aim to stay diversified and stick to your existing financial plan.\n\nMaintain a long-term perspective. Even if the presidential election does end up having an unexpected impact on the market, \"it's important to remember that you're investing for long-term goals, and short-term fluctuations won't have lasting effects,\" said Forbes.\n\nKeep your emotions out of it. While the election may understandably bring up big feelings, you will be better off financially if you can keep those emotions separate from your investment decisions. Indeed, said Vanguard, \"part of successful investing is understanding what you can control and letting your emotions take a backseat to the financial plan you and your advisor put in place.\"",

        "text": "2024 US election: Donald Trump's strange strategy of ignoring moderates\nA single televised debate is not, in and of itself, enough to win a presidential election, but it can act as an intense catalyst. The confrontation between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, on ABC on September 10, was all the more eagerly awaited as the Democratic candidate is faced with the challenges inherent to a very short campaign, following Joe Biden's withdrawal. She has very little time to (re)introduce herself to the general public, establish herself and appear credible. From this point of view, the debate was a complete success, rich in pithy barbs, punctuated by the vice president's telling facial expressions, as she swung between amused contempt and controlled irritation.\n\nRead more Subscribers only Harris, on offense, wins debate against Trump\n\nYet Harris's professional preparation and unexpected ease in the debate should not overshadow the other surprise to come out of this televised event: Trump's failure. His poor formal performance, but, more importantly, his poor strategic one. The former president lacked discipline, falling into the traps set by his opponent. He was unable to take advantage of his main trump card, as illustrated by the polls \u2013 economic issues.\n\nEven though annual inflation fell to 2.5% at the end of August, Trump could have focused on the housing crisis, the cost of basic necessities, highlighting the spectacular rise in prices over four years. While it would be dishonest to exclusively attribute these increases to the Biden administration, they are a handy argument for the Republican candidate, to feed nostalgia for a time when everyday life was easier. His greater familiarity with a golf cart \u2013 his favorite sport \u2013 than a shopping cart has led him to lack awareness of this subject.\n\nAt his worst\n\nHad he favored this angle of attack, Trump could have pinned the outgoing administration's track record on Harris. Instead, he let her appear as the candidate of \"change,\" as compared to him, his methods and his inflammatory rhetoric. The billionaire spouted falsehoods about Haitian migrants in Ohio eating household pets. He meandered off into digressions about the Capitol assault on January 6, 2021, defending the indefensible. In short, he reminded the debate's 67 million viewers of who he was, at his worst.\n\nRead more Subscribers only The Trump campaign's orchestrated lies\n\nYet the most astounding absence in the Republican candidate's remarks was that of any overture made to the center, which has been abandoned to Democratic strategists. At no point did the former president think of addressing undecided voters, who have their doubts about Harris, or even moderate conservatives, who have become tense or even hostile to the idea of supporting him.\n\nYou have 54.63% of this article left to read.

        "summary": " US Fed preparing for first interest rate cut in over four years ahead of 2024 presidential elections . Announcement expected on September 18 (US local time) this week . Senior Fed officials have indicated that rate cut is imminent, as inflation in the US eases towards the central bank's target of 2 per cent .",
        "text": "US Fed prepares for first interest rate cut in over four years ahead of 2024 presidential elections\nThe United States Federal Reserve (US Fed) this week is expected to announce its first interest rate cut in over four years since 2020, months ahead of the US presidential elections scheduled in November 2024, AFP reported.\n\nIt added that Fed policymakers will debate how big the cut will be ahead of the announcement expected on September 18 (US local time) this week.\n\nSenior Fed officials, including Chair Jerome Powell, have indicated that a rate cut is imminent, as inflation in the US eases towards the central bank's target of 2 per cent, and as the labour market continues to cool, the report added.\n\n\u2018Rate Cut Solely on Economic Data\u2019 The US Congress mandates that the central bank ensure stable prices and sustainable employment through independent action, and the Fed has often stressed that its rate cut decision will be based \u201csolely on the economic data\u201d, the AFP report said.\n\nA cut this week would still be a \u201cheadache\u201d for Powell, as it comes just two months before the election clash between Kamala Harris (Democratic nominee and US Vice President) and Donald Trump (Republican nominee and former US President).\n\n\u201cAs much as I think the Fed tries to say that they're not a political animal, we are in a really wild cycle right now,\u201d Alicia Modestino, an associate professor of economics at Northeastern University and former senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, told AFP.\n\nHow Big a Cut to Expect? September 17-18 will see policymakers debate on whether to move the cut by 25 basis points or 50 basis points (bps).\n\nHowever, either number would be significant since this is the Fed's first cut since March 2020, when it slashed rates to near-zero, in order to support the US economy through the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Fed began its rate hikes in 2022 in response to a surge in inflation, fueled largely by a post-pandemic supply crunch and the war in Ukraine; and has held its key lending rate at a two-decade high of between 5.25 and 5.50 per cent for the past 14 months, waiting for economic conditions to improve.\n\nNow, with inflation falling, the labour market cooling, and the US economy still growing, policymakers have decided that conditions are ripe for a cut.\n\nEase Into Things vs Be More Aggressive Policymakers are left with a choice: make a small 25 bps cut to ease into things or a more aggressive 50 bps cut to help the labour market despite the risk of reigniting inflation.\n\n\u201cI think that in advance of the November meeting, there's not quite enough data to say we're in jeopardy on the employment side,\u201d Modestino stated.\n\nAnalysts see the smaller cut as a safe bet. \u201cWe expect the Fed to cut by 25bp (basis points),\u201d economists at Bank of America wrote in a recent note to clients.\n\n\u201cThe Fed likes predictability. It's good for markets, good for consumers, good for workers. So a 25 basis point cut now, followed up by another 25 basis point cut in November after the next round of economic data, offers a somewhat smoother glide path for the economy,\u201d Modestino added.\n\nHow Many Cuts Are Expected? While analysts overwhelmingly expect the US Fed to start rate cuts in September, there is less clarity about what will follow. Many hope the central bank will illuminate their path in the updated economic forecast to be published on September 18.\n\nThe forecast will be from the Fed's 19-member rate-setting committee and will include their rate cut expectations, the report added.\n\nIn June, FOMC members sharply reduced the number of cuts they had pencilled in for this year from a median of three down to just one amid a small uptick in inflation. But as inflation has fallen and the labor market has weakened, expectations of more cuts have grown.\n\n\u201cWe continue to expect three rate cuts of 25 bps each at the remaining 2024 FOMC meetings,\u201d Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius wrote in a note to clients last week.\n\nTraders also see a greater-than 99 per cent chance of at least four more cuts in 2025, which would bring the Fed's key lending rate down to between 3.5 and 3.75 per cent \u2014 175 bps below current levels.",

        "text": "Dick Cheney was once vilified by Democrats. Now he\u2019s backing Harris. Will it matter?\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Dick Cheney is a career Republican still vilified by Democrats for his bullish defense of the Iraq War as vice president. But his partisan loyalties were cast aside in extraordinary fashion last week when he endorsed Democrat Kamala Harris for the White House.\n\nAlberto Gonzales\u2019 service in George W. Bush\u2019s administration was roiled by debates over intrusive government eavesdropping and an abrupt purging of U.S. attorneys that Democrats regarded with intense suspicion. Yet the former attorney general is also opting for Harris over Republican Donald Trump.\n\nThe endorsements crystalized the remarkable evolution of the Republican Party\u2019s establishment wing, which ruled Washington during the Bush years only to be sidelined once Trump wrested control of the party. These figures, once reviled by Democrats, are so alarmed by the prospect of the former president\u2019s return to power that they are prepared to oppose their own party\u2019s nominee for the White House.\n\nIn the process, they are giving Harris a critical opening to broaden her base of support.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easier for prominent Republicans like Cheney and Gonzales to say, \u2018I support Kamala Harris\u2019 because, in effect, their old home has been ransacked and destroyed,\u201d said Will Marshall, the founder of the Progressive Policy Institute, a center-left think tank. \u201cThe ties of partisanship, which are always strong in both parties, are attenuated by the fact that Trump has made today\u2019s Republican Party absolutely unwelcome for prominent Republicans who served in previous administrations.\u201d\n\nBush himself will not follow suit. A spokesperson says the former president has no plans to make endorsements or say publicly how he will vote.\n\nWhat to know about Trump\u2019s second term:\n\nStaffing the administration: Here are the people Trump has picked recess appointments Follow all of our coverage as Donald Trump assembles his second administration.\n\nHarris has embraced the backing of Republicans with whom she shares little common ground and whose endorsement likely has more to do with opposition to Trump than support of her policy positions. She frequently mentions that more than 200 Republicans have endorsed her, and her campaign said in an email playing up Gonzales\u2019 backing that it welcomed into the fold \u201cevery American \u2013 regardless of party \u2013 who values democracy and the rule of law.\u201d\n\nFormer Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, a Republican who endorsed Harris and spoke at last month\u2019s Democratic convention, said the effect of \u201ccard-carrying, time-tested Republicans\u201d who are behind Harris might persuade other Republicans who dislike Trump to vote against him rather than sitting out the election.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if we convince somebody to go Trump-to-Harris,\u201d Duncan said. \u201cI think we go from convincing somebody just sitting at home, not voting for anybody, to voting for Kamala Harris.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether the Republicans will have sway\n\nYet how much real influence Republicans long criticized by Democrats have is unclear, especially given lingering raw feelings and Cheney\u2019s polarizing persona across decades in Washington.\n\nEven as the Harris campaign basks in the support, comedian Jon Stewart mocked Cheney\u2019s endorsement on \u201cThe Daily Show,\u201d addressing the ex-vice president with an expletive and shouting: \u201cYou came this close to destroying the entire world. We were this close.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho in God\u2019s name is that endorsement gonna sway?\u201d Stewart demanded. \u201c\u2018Well, I like the Democrats\u2019 policy on child tax credits, but are they bombing enough Middle Eastern countries?\u2019\u201d\n\nIt would have long been unfathomable for Cheney to vote Democratic. He served three Republican presidents in roles ranging from White House chief of staff to defense secretary and vice president.\n\nCheney was denounced by Democrats on many fronts, including for his staunch promotion of the defense contracting firm he once helped lead, Halliburton, as well as his entanglement in a scandal over the leaking of the identity of CIA operative Valerie Plame, whose ambassador-husband disputed the U.S. intelligence used to justify the Iraq invasion.\n\nAfter Cheney accidentally shot a friend during a 2006 hunting trip, even Peggy Noonan, a former speechwriter for President Ronald Reagan and veteran of Bush\u2019s reelection campaign, suggested he might need to step aside.\n\n\u201cAt a certain point, a hate magnet can draw so much hate you don\u2019t want to hold it in your hand anymore, you want to drop it,\u201d she wrote then in the Wall Street Journal.\n\nYet Cheney endured through Bush\u2019s two terms.\n\nThat Cheney \u201cis now considered a mainstream Republican is a sad commentary on that party and all the more reason to keep Trump and Republicans far from power in 2024,\u201d said Adam Green co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee.\n\nCheney, in 2005 speech, derided critics of the Iraq War as \u201copportunists\u201d and said the suggestion that the Bush administration had purposely misled the public about the presence of weapons of mass destruction was \u201cone of the most dishonest and reprehensible charges ever aired\u201d in Washington. He later said the Democrats\u2019 approach to the war would \u201cvalidate the al-Qaida approach,\u201d drawing a rebuke from then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.\n\nThe GOP\u2019s ideological divide\n\nThe ideological split within the Republican Party was evident long ago. Trump centered his 2016 campaign around a repudiation of the old-guard GOP base, including insisting, incorrectly, that he had always been opposed to the war.\n\nCheney was a prominent critic of Trump\u2019s foreign policy, rebuking the then-president at a closed-door retreat in 2019 for public complaints about the role of NATO and the surprise announcement of the withdrawal of troops from Syria.\n\nThe rupture was again on display after the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol. Cheney visited the building on the attack\u2019s one-year anniversary, sitting with his daughter, then-Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., in the front row of the Republican side of the the House chamber as the only two members of the party at a pro forma session.\n\nLiz Cheney, who co-chaired the House investigation into the siege before losing her seat in the 2022 Republican primary, announced her support of Harris last week, followed by her father\u2019s statement that Trump \u201ccan never be trusted with power again.\u201d\n\nCrystal McLaughlin, a 53-year-old Greensboro, North Carolina, health care compliance worker, said she was \u201cvery, very nervous\u201d when Cheney was vice president but that she appreciates the Cheneys\u2019 endorsements and hopes other Republicans will follow suit.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t trust him, but you know, thank you for your support,\u201d McLaughlin said, adding, \u201cAnd hopefully your financial support.\u201d\n\nGonzales, the former attorney general, said he has spoken with Trump only once. But Gonzales surfaced in a Politico opinion piece Thursday as Trump\u2019s latest prominent Republican detractor. Gonzales cited the Capitol attack, Trump\u2019s criminal cases and other factors in branding him unfit for office and contemptuous of the rule of law.\n\n\u201cAs the United States approaches a critical election, I can\u2019t sit quietly as Donald Trump \u2014 perhaps the most serious threat to the rule of law in a generation \u2014 eyes a return to the White House,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThat is remarkable considering that Gonzales faced condemnation from Democrats, and some GOP lawmakers, before resigning amid a scandal over the abrupt dismissal of a group of U.S. attorneys.\n\nSome of those fired prosecutors said they felt pressured to investigate Democrats before elections. Gonzales maintained the dismissals were based on what he said were the prosecutors\u2019 lackluster performance records.\n\nAs White House counsel in 2004, Gonzales pressed to reauthorize a secret domestic spying program, over the Justice Department\u2019s protests. Though robust government surveillance had been championed by Republican leaders after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, that support has significantly waned within the party as lawmakers take their cue from Trump\u2019s skepticism of the FBI.\n\n\u201cEvery Republican, for the most part, at some point, is going to have to take their medicine and admit that Donald Trump was wrong for our party,\u201d said Duncan, the former Georgia lieutenant governor. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of when they do it.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Makiya Seminera in Greensboro, North Carolina, contributed to this report.",

The event, sponsored by the College of Undergraduate Studies, takes place 11:30 a.m. \u2013 12:45 p.m. in the Student Union Key West Ballroom. Register here.\n\nWhy do we have an Electoral College? The selection of the president is outlined in perhaps the most confusing clause in the Constitution (Article II, Sec. 1). Perhaps nothing better could be expected from a measure written by the delightfully named \u201cCommittee on Postponed Parts.\u201d\n\nWhy did delegates to the Constitutional Convention struggle so much deciding upon the best method for selecting the president that they needed to postpone the debate several times?\n\nFear.\n\nLearn more about this topic at the Constitution Day Lunch and Learn on Sept. 17.\n\nThey feared a strong executive. They feared Congress controlling the president. They feared men with \u201ctalents for low intrigue and the little arts of popularity\u201d charming ill-informed voters (Federalist 68). They feared voters only supporting local candidates. They feared that the president would be subservient to any group that selected him, so instead they ended up with a cumbersome process that used specially chosen electors to elect the president.\n\nTo further complicate things, the process immediately unraveled and almost never worked as intended. Their plan was that voters would select prominent men as electors. These men (and they were, of course, all elite white men) would have a greater breadth of knowledge of gentlemen from other states, and they would be free to choose anyone they wished. Theoretically, every four years, the electors would vote for the best candidates and the nation would prosper from their wise choices.\n\nThere were a litany of things the delegates did not anticipate: political parties (they feared these, too), joint tickets for president and vice president (they planned for the person who came in second place to be vice president), candidates actively running for office, improved communication and a growing trust in democracy (The Constitution allows each state to decide how to select its own electors. So, for a time, some voters did not even get to choose the electors let alone vote for president.)\n\nSome of these problems have been resolved. The 12th amendment ended the idea that the person who comes in second becomes the vice president. Since 1868, in every state, people vote for the president, and the state electors are generally bound by their decision.\n\nNeither of these changes, however, have resolved the biggest complaint against the Electoral College. With electoral votes based on the number of congressmen and senators a state has, a candidate \u2014 with victories in the correct combination of states \u2014 can win the presidency while losing the popular vote.\n\nSince the Constitution\u2019s ratification, there have been over 1,000 amendments proposed to change or eliminate the Electoral College. These proposals generally offer the obvious solution; the president should be the candidate who gets the most popular votes. Given that, according to most polls including a 2023 Pew Research Center study, approximately two out of three Americans support this change, why haven\u2019t we just amended the Constitution to have the president popularly elected? As is often the case, the easy solution is not as easy as it seems. The problems include:\n\nAmending the Constitution. It is not easy to amend the Constitution. An amendment needs the support of two-thirds of each branch in Congress and three-quarters of the states. Getting congressional support has proven problematic (in 1969, Congress came close \u2014 the House approved a popular vote amendment, but the Senate did not). While two-thirds of Americans might favor a change in the Electoral College, the current leadership of the Republican Party does not. Why not? Well, in the last 24 years, two Republicans (George W. Bush and Donald Trump) have won the presidency with fewer votes than their Democratic opponent (and 2020 almost made it a third time.) While the electoral college currently skews Republican, that has not always been the case. In the 19 elections since World War II, it has favored Democrats nine times and Republicans ten times. Based on the 2022 midterm results and recent polling in 2024 swing states, studies also show that it might be trending towards Democrats in the upcoming years.\n\nIt is not easy to amend the Constitution. An amendment needs the support of two-thirds of each branch in Congress and three-quarters of the states. Getting congressional support has proven problematic (in 1969, Congress came close \u2014 the House approved a popular vote amendment, but the Senate did not). Vote fraud. Nearly every election produces allegations of vote fraud. In the current system, however, those allegations are often muted. How? The electoral college successfully smooths over most minor vote fraud. Right now, the relevant question is not whether there was any vote fraud but whether there were enough fraudulent votes to change a state\u2019s electoral vote and potentially change the results in the Electoral College. In a popular vote world, where every vote counts, so does every fraudulent vote. Does anyone truly believe there has ever been a presidential election without fraudulent votes? Not even one or two? Unlike the Electoral College, a popular vote system encourages, albeit unintentionally, overzealous partisans to take every edge they can.\n\nNearly every election produces allegations of vote fraud.

Right now, the relevant question is not whether there was any vote fraud but whether there were enough fraudulent votes to change a state\u2019s electoral vote and potentially change the results in the Electoral College. Close races. The 2000 presidential election is one of the elections where the popular vote winner (Al Gore) lost. It was the first time that it had happened since 1888. The race came down to a few hundred votes in Florida. Popular vote supporters use this an example of the flaws in the Electoral College, but that election also demonstrates some of the potential complications in using popular vote totals. For one thing, Gore didn\u2019t win a majority of the popular vote. No one did. He won a plurality. Because of third party candidates, Gore received 48.4% of the popular vote. Is that enough? Or would we have a runoff? How would a runoff work? Neither party was happy with the recount procedure. Florida law stipulated it must be completed in a week, but it quickly became apparent that accurately recounting votes by hand took much more time than that. Plus, there was a sense that the recount was no more accurate than the original results. Imagine a situation where this occurred at a nationwide level. A national recount would be an incredibly complex and divisive event involving competing and unprovable sets of numbers as well as lengthy legal challenges. And, it would undoubtedly be unsatisfying as even a cursory dive into studies on the Florida vote count reveals the futility of trying to finding the exact numbers of votes that either Bush or Gore received.\n\nWe are the only nation that still uses an Electoral College. If other countries have figured out how to run a national popular presidential election, should the United States consider making a change? The nation, or maybe a new Committee on Postponed Parts, would have to come up with a plan which resolves some of these potential pitfalls. Given that this discussion has already lasted well over 100 years, we may be in for 100 more.\n\nProfessor of History John M.

A CNN article on the meme suggested that the large number of bizarre incidents in Florida can be attributed to several factors: public records laws that allow journalists easy access to police reports, the state\u2019s sizeable population, its wildly unpredictable weather, and, frankly, inadequate mental health funding.Here are a few recent examples:In fact, there\u2019s even an internet game called the Florida Man Birthday Challenge, where you type your birthday followed by \"Florida Man\" to discover the wild adventure of a Florida resident on that day.Going forward, 15th September will read: \u201cFlorida Man tries to assassinate Donald Trump.\u201dOf course, some pedants might point out that \"Florida Man\" doesn\u2019t apply here, as Ryan Routh was most recently in Hawaii and spent much of his life in North Carolina, but you know what they say about Rome...While assassination attempts on US Presidents (and presidential candidates) are very much part of the nation\u2019s history, a second attempt during a single election cycle is quite rare. This second attempt on Trump took place in his natural habitat \u2013 the golf course \u2013 where a man named Ryan Routh, armed with an AK-47 rifle, managed to get within 300-500 yards of where Trump was golfing.The last time Trump was shot at, it became an iconic image, after which Trump, in his usual humble style, boasted: \u201cA lot of people say it\u2019s the most iconic photo they\u2019ve ever seen. They\u2019re right, and I didn\u2019t die. Usually, you have to die to have an iconic picture.\u201dThis time, he joked with his doctor that he was glad he \u201cdidn\u2019t need his services today\u201d and told Sean Hannity of Fox News that he was \u201cdisappointed not to be able to finish his putt,\u201d noting that he was \u201ceven and had a birdie putt.\u201dInterestingly, Routh has been in the news before. In 2023, he appeared in a New York Times profile about Americans who had travelled to Ukraine after Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion. He claimed to have tried to recruit Afghan soldiers \u2013 who had fled the Taliban \u2013 to fight against Russia, and his social media profile makes it hard to pinpoint his exact political ideology.In 2016, he voted for Trump before becoming infuriated with him. By 2020, Routh was quite infatuated with Tulsi Gabbard , and more recently appeared to support a Ramaswamy-Haley Republican ticket. He wrote on X (formerly Twitter) when Ramaswamy dropped out: \u201cYou cannot quit. Why? You must stay on the ballot until the end. You must fight. You must keep giving speeches and push all the way to Election Day, no matter the results. Do not give in. Join Nikki and keep working. Never give up.\u201dThe first assassination attempt on Trump prompted the Democratic establishment to pull the plug on Joe Biden\u2019s presidency.To be fair, we\u2019re in completely uncharted waters here, with a second assassination attempt on a presidential nominee during one election cycle. America\u2019s current broken kulturkampf makes it difficult to predict the outcome, especially as MAGA has fundamentally transformed the Republican Party. What was once a party of fiscal conservatism, respect for institutions, and commitment to free markets has shifted to a personality-driven populist movement centred around Trump. This shift has alienated many traditional Republicans, created deep internal divisions, and left the GOP grappling with an identity crisis. Before the assassination attempt, the Republican Party 's major attack was based on the false rumour that Haitians were eating cats in Springfield, Ohio.Here are the ten big developments for the day:",

        "text": "Dartmouth to Host 2024 Election Series\nBody\n\nDartmouth will host a 2024 Election Speaker Series leading up to the Nov. 5 election and beyond, bringing in policy leaders, public officials, and analysts from across the political spectrum to discuss the most pressing issues facing American democracy today.\n\nAmong the speakers in the series, which is sponsored by the Nelson A. Rockefeller Center for Public Policy and the Social Sciences and Dartmouth Dialogues, will be Vice President Mike Pence, who will speak at Dartmouth on Oct. 31, five days before the election. Pence is speaking out publicly in favor of conservative values and has said he will not endorse either former President Donald Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nU.S. Sen. John Fetterman, a first-term Democrat from Pennsylvania, will also speak at Dartmouth next month.\n\nAnd the speaker at the conclusion of the series in February will be Anita Hill, a Brandeis University professor whose testimony in 1991 alleging sexual harassment by Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas sparked a national conversation on the issue.\n\nOther speakers include civil rights leader Sherrilyn Ifill, conservative commentator Bill Kristol, and polling expert Harry Enten \u201911.\n\nPresident Sian Leah Beilock says the series is an important addition to Dartmouth Dialogues, which, among other topics, took up the Israeli-Hamas war with invited speakers and faculty members exchanging ideas and sharing perspectives with the whole community.\n\n\u201cThese upcoming speakers, and the new Election Series itself, reinforce our commitment to bringing a variety of perspectives to campus as we promote civil dialogue, bridge-building, and finding solutions,\u201d President Beilock says. \u201cIn our partisan times, it\u2019s even more important that universities help students learn how to think, not what to think, part of which we do through invited guests from across an ideological spectrum.\u201d\n\nThe series is open to Dartmouth students and the general public and is part of a new, one-time-only course on the 2024 election that will give 70 students a chance to interact in a small-group setting with many of the speakers.\n\nQuote Politics is about engaging ideas and people, not shouting them down. A liberal arts education is about engaging ideas and people, not shouting them down. The course reflects that. Attribution Herschel Nachlis, associate director and senior policy fellow at the Rockefeller Center, and research assistant professor of government\n\nThe course, cross listed by the Rockefeller Center and the Department of Government, will be taught by Russell Muirhead, the Robert Clements Professor of Democracy and Politics; Herschel Nachlis, associate director and senior policy fellow at the Rockefeller Center, and a research assistant professor of government; and William Wohlforth, the Daniel Webster Professor of Government.\n\n\u201cThe team-taught course on \u2018The 2024 Election\u2019 will feature some of our most experienced professors at Dartmouth on a critically important topic,\u201d says Rockefeller Center Director Jason Barabas \u201993. \u201cThe faculty team aims to showcase a range of policy perspectives and issue debates, often by bringing high-level thought leaders to campus. The course will be a great learning opportunity for students, and it fits quite well with the mission of the Rockefeller Center to facilitate cross-cutting dialogues as it helps to prepare the next generation of policy leaders.\u201d\n\nNachlis praised the efforts of Dartmouth leadership, the Rockefeller Center and its staff, particularly Assistant Director Dvora Greenberg Koelling, who spearheaded the Speaker Series, and the faculty colleagues who collaborated to design the course, professors Muirhead and Wohlforth, for their efforts to make this project a reality.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s another course like this anywhere else in the country,\u201d says Nachlis. \u201cTo bring to Dartmouth top experts on many aspects of the election from diverse ideologies and identities, and to assemble a teaching team with diverse expertise and interests, all in such a short time, is remarkable. But Russ, Bill, Dvora, and I wanted to engage the campus and community in this hugely important and controversial election.\u201d\n\nA key element of the class and the premise of Dartmouth\u2019s approach to dialogue is that it is built on a foundation of listening and mutual respect, he says.\n\n\u201cPolitics is about engaging ideas and people, not shouting them down. A liberal arts education is about engaging ideas and people, not shouting them down. The course reflects that,\u201d Nachlis says.\n\nAlso, Dartmouth\u2019s place as a stop for New Hampshire\u2019s first-in-the-nation primary has long brought the presidential election to campus, he says, but in recent years efforts by the Democratic National Committee to reshuffle the primary schedule has called into question New Hampshire\u2019s continued spot at the start of the political calendar.\n\n\u201cDartmouth has long had a front-row seat to American politics and political campaigns,\u201d Nachlis says. \u201cI think in this class we\u2019re making good on that unique opportunity by bringing some of the best and the brightest to our students and our community, even if presidential politics and national campaigns shift a little bit away from New Hampshire.\u201d\n\nInformation about registration, video streams of the events, and full biographies of the speakers are available on the Election Speaker Series website. Here is the series schedule, which is subject to change:\n\n\n\nSherrilyn Ifill\n\nSept. 24, Sherrilyn Ifill will speak on \u201cReimagining a New American Democracy, Racial Equity, and the Constitution,\u201d 5-6 p.m., Filene Auditorium.

        "text": "Teens tell us how invested they feel in the U.S. presidential election\nA mural on the street outside of the Detroit Department of Elections on Mon., July 29, 2024 ahead of the August 6 primaries in Detroit, Michigan.\n\nThis is republished as part of a series in collaboration with the Headway Election Challenge. Chalkbeat and Headway at The New York Times will ask young people to share their insights and perspectives throughout the 2024 presidential election.\n\nIn 2023, Ankita Jaikumar wasn\u2019t very politically active. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy that last year I didn\u2019t know any candidates,\u201d the 16-year-old high school senior said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know who represented me. I didn\u2019t know what was going on.\u201d\n\nThen things started to change. Her dad, a dedicated news watcher, often had CNN and Fox News on in the background. At first, she found it boring, but eventually, she started paying attention. She became more engaged in political conversations, especially around issues that mattered to her, like those affecting the Asian American and Pacific Islander community.\n\nLess than six months ago, she organized an event.\n\n\u201cAround April, I hosted my first-ever poetry open mic,\u201d she said. \u201cThat was the first time I organized something myself and did outreach to different people.\u201d\n\nIt was the first time, she said, that she felt like she had created something bigger than her.\n\nNow, less than two months before an election she can\u2019t even vote in, Ms. Jaikumar is as plugged in as anyone. She\u2019s volunteering for campaigns, involved in school groups and representing Atlanta as a 2024-2025 Youth Poet Laureate ambassador.\n\nWe heard from Ms. Jaikumar as part of our Headway Election Challenge, a collaboration between Headway and Chalkbeat to understand how teens relate to the November election \u2014 whether they\u2019re voting for the first time or not.\n\nWho we heard from\n\nIn the first week of the challenge, and in collaboration with Chalkbeat, we asked two related questions: How much do teenagers care about the election? and How much do you think the presidential election will affect you and your family\u2019s life?\n\nRelated Follow the presidential election with Chalkbeat and The New York Times\n\nMore than 200 teenagers from 39 states responded. We heard from 14-year-olds who follow every headline, and 19-year-olds who said they weren\u2019t inclined to vote, despite being eligible to do so.\n\nThis is why we started the challenge with this theme: to understand the disconnect between teenagers who feel the stakes are high and those who don\u2019t consider the election worth their while, even though they can vote.\n\nHere\u2019s how the responses broke down:\n\nTeenagers paying attention\n\nAmong the teens paying at least some attention, about three-quarters said the election would have a moderate to significant effect on their lives and families. These teens highlighted issues like the economy, health care, immigration policies and rights related to race, gender and L.G.B.T.Q. identity.\n\nDespite the fact that more than half of those we heard from won\u2019t be 18 years old on Election Day, many of these teenagers are still invested in the election and its outcome. They\u2019re driven to pay attention because of the effect they think the election result will have on them and their families. Some, like Ms. Jaikumar, are making their voices heard in ways other than voting.\n\nTeenagers paying little attention\n\nAmong those who are tuning out the election, only about a fifth believe the election would significantly affect their families. Most of these respondents were not eligible to vote, which was not surprising. There\u2019s a reason election-obsessed 14-year-olds are not the stereotype.\n\nA small number of teenagers who will be 18 or 19 on Nov. 5 told us they weren\u2019t paying attention. A few of these respondents indicated they were planning to vote anyway. Others said they weren\u2019t because they didn\u2019t care, were indifferent, or didn\u2019t see much of a difference between their ballot options.\n\nExploring the disconnect teens feel about the presidential election\n\nAs we move forward with the challenge, we will continue to explore this disconnect and the reasons behind it, in the words of the teenagers who participate. We\u2019re especially interested in how teenagers who are invested in the election relate to their less-engaged peers.\n\nAshley Han, a 16-year-old junior at Skyline High School in Ann Arbor, Michigan, sits somewhere in the middle of these two groups. She\u2019s not a politics nerd, but she\u2019s far from indifferent. As editor-in-chief of her school newspaper, she follows the news regularly and helps to inform her peers, a role she takes seriously.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even think it matters what your political opinion is, but I think it\u2019s so important that young people know what\u2019s going on,\u201d Ms. Han said. \u201cBecause I feel like politics really does affect every single part of your life.\u201d\n\nThat brings us to this week\u2019s challenge\n\nHow do young people know what\u2019s going on? How do they find information they trust? And how do they discuss it with others? Take our survey here to tell us how you inform yourself and others about the election.\n\nDid you miss last week? Not sure where to start? Go back to the start of the challenge here.",

The 900-page document claims: \u201cThe federal government is a behemoth, weaponized against American citizens and conservative values, with freedom and liberty under siege as never before\u201d",
        "text": "Project 2025 will go on, even if Kamala Harris wins the US presidency\nMany pillars of Project 2025 have already been implemented at the federal and state level; some \u2013 with the Democrats\u2019 assistance.\n\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re going to hear tonight is a detailed and dangerous plan called Project 2025, that the former president intends on implementing if he were elected again,\u201d Vice President Kamala Harris warned the audience at the beginning of the first and possibly last debate with her opponent, former President Donald Trump.\n\nTrump responded that he had \u201cnothing to do\u201d with it \u2013 a claim journalists and pundits have repeatedly refuted.\n\nConservative think tank the Heritage Foundation published Project 2025 in 2023 as a policy framework document for the Republican presidential candidate. Although Trump distanced himself from Project 2025 in July, he endorsed the Heritage Foundation\u2019s work on it while it was still being drafted. \u201cThis is a great group, and they\u2019re going to lay the groundwork and detail plans for exactly what our movement will do and what your movement will do,\u201d Trump said at a dinner hosted by the foundation in 2022.\n\nFrom the far-right perspective, Project 2025 stands as a metaphorical Hoover Dam against \u201cthe long march of cultural Marxism through our institutions\u201d. The introduction of the 900-page document claims: \u201cThe federal government is a behemoth, weaponized against American citizens and conservative values, with freedom and liberty under siege as never before.\u201d The goal of the project is outlined as restoring \u201c[the American] Republic to its original moorings\u201d.\n\nOne can be forgiven for thinking that more than 50 conservative think tanks and NGOs getting together to formulate policy for a future president is unprecedented. Yet, Project 2025 is hardly the first time a bunch of far-right Beltway policy wonks have colluded to help set an agenda for a would-be conservative presidency.\n\nIf the political class was truly being transparent, they would call this playbook Project 1965, because that is at least how far back the American right started working on resetting progressive policies.\n\nThere is certainly much to be outraged about even with a cursory read of Project 2025. Conservative policymakers want to privatise the Transportation Security Agency (TSA), the Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s (FEMA) National Food Insurance Program, the federal housing loan giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and all federal subsidised student loans.\n\nThe Project 2025 gurus also long for the elimination of the US Department of Education (DOE) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The DOE\u2019s crime is they are \u201ca convenient one-stop shop for the woke education cartel, which \u2013 as the COVID era showed \u2013 is not particularly concerned with children\u2019s education. Schools should be responsive to parents, rather than to leftist advocates intent on indoctrination.\u201d\n\nAs for NOAA, they are \u201ca colossal operation that has become one of the main drivers of the climate change alarm industry and\u201d are \u201charmful\u201d because of their \u201cfatal conceit of planning for the unplannable\u201d.\n\nIf these far-right recommendations are not enough to spark consternation, there is plenty more. Project 2025\u2019s authors also want the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to require states to track all abortions within their borders or threaten those states with \u201cthe cutting of funds\u201d.\n\nThe CDC\u2019s \u201cabortion surveillance and maternity mortality reporting systems are woefully inadequate\u201d, one Project 2025 author writes, as \u201cliberal states have now become sanctuaries for abortion tourism\u201d. At the same time, he recommends the CDC \u201cimmediately end its collection of data on gender identity\u201d, a scientific reality they labelled an \u201cunscientific notion\u201d.\n\nOn diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programmes, critical race theory, and gender identity, Project 2025\u2019s authors write in multiple places about eliminating \u201csocial engineering \u2026 climate change [mitigation], critical race theory, manufactured extremism, and other polarizing policies\u201d. They refuse to believe that \u201csystemic racism\u201d is a thing.\n\nYet, as shocking as Project 2025\u2019s prescriptions are, many of them are not new. A great number of them have appeared in the Heritage Foundation-led publication Mandate for Leadership, which has been a mostly quadrennial manual for conservatives since 1981.\n\nInitially, the Heritage Foundation and its collaborators made this playbook available to both the Democratic and Republican parties. With the rise of the conservatives to power, however, the Mandate for Leadership became fully-tuned to centre-right and far-right rule.\n\nThere have been nine Mandate for Leadership publications in all for every presidential election cycle since 1980, except for 1992, 2008, and 2012. Even in 1981, conservative policy wonks wanted to \u201crevitalize our economy\u201d through deregulation and massive tax cuts to \u201cstrengthen our national security\u201d with beefed-up defence budgets and to \u201chalt the centralization of power in the federal government\u201d by privatising public goods.\n\nThe roots of Mandate for Leadership go back even further, to the resistance to the fight for racial justice and civil rights in the 1950s and 60s. The backlash against the Civil Rights Movement helped spark the conservative movement\u2019s rise.\n\nIn 1962, as Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater geared up for his eventual run as the Republican nominee for president, he declared, \u201cI don\u2019t like segregation. But I don\u2019t like the Constitution kicked around either.\u201d When the Civil Rights Act of 1964 did make its way through Congress, South Carolina Senator Strom Thurmond appeared on TV to say he was leaving the Democratic Party for the Republicans. \u201cThe Democratic Party has forsaken the people to become the party of minority groups,\u201d Thurmond angrily said.\n\nThe stage was set for a merger between the embryonic conservative movement, the Republican Party, and former members of the Democratic Party\u2019s southern wing over their shared opposition to civil rights and other social justice issues. That coalition culminated in Richard Nixon\u2019s successful \u201cSouthern Strategy\u201d and appeals to the \u201csilent majority\u201d that won him the presidency in 1968.\n\nSince then, conservative operators have been hard at work infusing their right-wing ideas into many areas of American life. The partial privatisation of the US Postal Service, for example, has been under way for five decades. The authors of the first Mandate for Leadership called for an end to the public \u201cmonopoly\u201d of the US Postal Service in 1981.\n\nSchool choice in the form of public charter schools has become a reality in many school districts across the United States over the past 35 years, which constitutes an indirect sort of privatisation. Restrictions on public money for abortions and contraceptives made their way into federal policies in the 1970s, and the US Supreme Court overturned \u201cthe right to privacy\u201d in terms of women\u2019s reproductive rights with the Dobbs decision two years ago, after decades of increasing legal restrictions.\n\nEven if Harris becomes the 47th president of the US in January, Project 2025, or really, the post-1965 project of making the US a far-right nation-state, will continue unabated. She may be able to stop full implementation at the federal level with Democratic control of the House and the Senate or with her veto power. But she will not be able to stop it at the state level, where so many recommendations from American conservatives are already fully implemented.\n\nOn abortion alone, since the Dobbs decision, 14 states have banned abortion entirely, while another 11 have placed restrictions on it, and in three more where there are no legal protections for it. At least 26 states have banned DEI programmes, critical race theory materials, and gender-affirming care in recent years.\n\nDespite far-right complaints about the federal government\u2019s unaccountability in spending US tax dollars on \u201cthe Great Awokening\u201d and on a bloated \u201cAdministrative State\u201d, the truth is, both Democrats and Republicans at the federal and state levels have kept social welfare spending in austerity mode for decades.\n\nUsing \u201cactive-duty military personnel and National Guardsmen\u201d to patrol the border and arrest \u201cillegal aliens\u201d is also a Project 2025 recommendation, but in fact, both the Trump and Biden administrations have already been implementing this xenophobic policy. And Texas, Tennessee, Florida, and other states have deployed their state National Guards in recent years, albeit in a disorganised fashion.\n\nHarris may be using Project 2025 in her campaign to attack Trump and scare moderates and independents into voting for her, but the far-right project of revealing the US as a place of freedom for a few and fascism for many will continue, even if she wins.\n\nAfter all, this conservative project has had 60 years to build up its enormous momentum, all too frequently with help from Democrats and centrists like Harris.\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the author\u2019s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera\u2019s editorial stance.",

        "summary": " The fate of the US-Korean alliance and Korea\u2019s security are at stake in this U.S. presidential election in 2024 . The authors say the US and ROK alliance has never been stronger and more able to deter North Korea or, failing that, defeat aggression .",
        "text": "Strong ties, high anxiety: The US-Korean alliance ahead of the 2024 election\nOn the eve of a presidential election that could decide the fate of the U.S. alliance system, America\u2019s security partnership with the Republic of Korea (ROK) has never been stronger and more able to deter North Korea or, failing that, to defeat aggression.\n\nSouth Korea is a key pillar of the U.S. alliance network in the Indo-Pacific region, a long-standing and trusted ally, and a beacon of democracy, freedom, and economic growth. South Korea\u2019s rise to success was in no small measure due to America\u2019s investment of blood and treasure, for which the Korean people remain deeply grateful. Today, the alliance deters North Korea and provides cost-free facilities that facilitate U.S. regional military operations and allow the United States to send an important message of deterrence to China, Russia, and other potential adversaries.\n\nHowever, North Korea\u2019s nuclear capabilities, a dangerous North Korea-Russia \u201ccomprehensive strategic partnership,\u201d and a U.S. presidential candidate who has questioned the value of the U.S.-Korea military partnership have shaken South Korea\u2019s confidence in the future of the alliance. In many Koreans\u2019 eyes, both the fate of the alliance and Korea\u2019s security are at stake in this U.S. presidential election.\n\nStronger than ever\n\nAmerica\u2019s alliance with South Korea is more capable and interoperable than ever. U.S. and ROK alliance managers have never been more in sync, including in their assessments of the North Korean threat and their concern about China\u2019s ambitions, Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine, Moscow\u2019s new military ties with North Korea, and the Russia-China \u201cpartnership without limits.\u201d\n\nROK President Yoon Suk Yeol has moved Korea closer to the United States while holding China at arm\u2019s length. Yoon has responded positively to Washington\u2019s urging to work more cooperatively with Japan\u2014America\u2019s other key East Asian ally. Yoon and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida have deftly managed Korea-Japan differences and forged a solid bilateral relationship. Today, South Korea, Japan, and the United States have built an important trilateral partnership, including on security issues, fulfilling a long-standing U.S. goal. Nevertheless, progress in stabilizing South Korea-Japan ties remains fragile, and shifts in domestic political winds or leadership in either Seoul or Tokyo could result in new or revived tensions.\n\nYoon has adopted a firm posture toward North Korea\u2014reversing his progressive predecessor\u2019s conciliatory approach that had frequently raised concerns in Washington. In contrast to the previous Moon Jae-in government\u2019s concessionary approach, Yoon\u2019s administration has emphasized military strength, deterrence, and assured retaliation in dealing with North Korea.\n\nNorth Korea, Russia, Ukraine, NATO, and new horizons\n\nThe Yoon government has reacted strongly to Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s June 2024 summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and the conclusion of a new Russia-North Korea treaty that includes a mutual assistance clause. Seoul has even hinted that it might begin direct military assistance to Ukraine if Russia provides sensitive military and satellite technology to North Korea.\n\nSouth Korea is building closer ties with NATO and expanding its sale of arms to European countries. Seoul has actively participated in recent NATO summits as a member of the \u201cIndo-Pacific 4\u201d (together with Japan, Australia, and New Zealand), including the July 2024 75th-anniversary summit in Washington.\n\nSouth Korea is a core part of the liberal international order and a pillar of democracy, freedom, and free-market economic growth. And Yoon has left no doubt that he sees the alliance with the United States, and the U.S. extended deterrent, as more central than ever to his country\u2019s security.\n\nRestoration and reaffirmation\n\nOver the past three years, the Biden administration has restored bilateral goodwill and Korean confidence in the U.S. defense commitment, which were damaged by former President Donald Trump\u2019s blunt criticism of Korea, his questioning of the value of the alliance, and his demand for an unprecedented increase in South Korean defense burden sharing.\n\nDuring the Trump administration, South Koreans were dismayed by charges they were not contributing enough to their defense and to the upkeep of U.S. forces, despite providing the bulk of front-line combat forces against North Korea, funding almost the entire cost of the construction of the United States\u2019 largest overseas military base, and despite Seoul\u2019s record of agreeing to regular biennial increases in support for U.S. forces.\n\nUnder the Biden administration, the United States has resumed large-scale military exercises with South Korean forces, which Trump unilaterally suspended as part of his failed diplomacy with North Korea. The absence of those exercises led, in the view of experts, to a decline in military readiness. The United States has also regularized the dispatch of strategic military assets, including nuclear-capable bombers, aircraft carriers, and attack submarines, to Korea to demonstrate its preparedness to use all the weapons in its arsenal to defend its ally.\n\nThe Washington Declaration, issued at the April 2023 U.S.-ROK summit between Presidents Joe Biden and Yoon, contained the strongest-ever U.S. extended deterrence commitment to South Korea. It also established the Nuclear Consultative Group to discuss, plan, and coordinate the possible use of U.S. strategic and tactical nuclear weapons. The Washington Declaration eased but did not eliminate South Korean concerns that a more inwardly focused United States might not stand by its commitment to defend South Korea in a crisis, including with nuclear weapons. For that reason, many in South Korea continue to want even more concrete extended nuclear deterrence assurances than those already provided by Washington.\n\nHigh anxiety\n\nDespite a reinvigorated bilateral alliance and strong U.S. assurances, South Korea remains anxious about the alliance\u2019s future. Concerns that Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear arsenal is now a permanent threat, and that the Russia-North Korea partnership has created a serious new threat, are contributing to this anxiety.\n\nBut the main factor troubling South Koreans is the belief that Trump\u2019s return to the White House would end the Biden administration\u2019s alliance-strengthening approach, bring renewed anti-alliance rhetoric and massive burden-sharing demands, and even see a reduction in U.S. forces on the Korean Peninsula. Such concerns have fueled a lively debate in South Korea about the need to acquire its own nuclear weapons\u2014a debate that has been spurred by former Trump administration officials who have proposed downsizing the U.S. military presence and shifting the U.S. military\u2019s mission away from the defense of Korea.\n\nAs a result, the Biden administration has further strengthened the U.S. commitment, including with an agreement to regularize the deployment of U.S. strategic assets to Korea. This new agreement should ease ROK concerns, but we should not underestimate the strength of pro-nuclear sentiment in South Korea, especially if Washington decides to distance itself from its longtime ally.\n\nRecommendations\n\nThe next U.S. president should build on the strong foundation that has been laid for future U.S.-Korea cooperation. The new president will find a willing partner in Seoul for a more comprehensive partnership, including on security issues, economic and technology cooperation, climate change, supply chain stability, peacekeeping, and humanitarian and development assistance. Taking advantage of this opportunity would enhance America\u2019s own security and stature.\n\nDealing with the North Korean nuclear and conventional threats, however, must remain the alliance\u2019s central priority. Unilateral U.S. steps to deal with Pyongyang must be avoided, particularly actions that might be perceived in Seoul as signaling acceptance of North Korea\u2019s nuclear arsenal.\n\nAmerica\u2019s allies and partners around the globe will watch carefully how the next U.S. administration manages ties with Seoul. The next U.S. president will have an opportunity to send a message about the importance of alliances and the value of America\u2019s word and commitments. Failure to convey that message would have enormous consequences for America\u2019s credibility and leadership.\n\nBut if a Trump victory over Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in November brings renewed questioning of the alliance and attacks on Seoul\u2019s defense contributions, officials in the next administration will need to make the strongest possible case for alliance ties with Seoul and why they are in America\u2019s interest. Congressional supporters of the bilateral alliance, particularly Republicans, will play a major role in this regard.\n\nLastly, South Korea\u2019s president and senior Korean officials will have to engage in unprecedented outreach to the Trump team to make the case for the alliance and continued U.S. support. They should not assume that their arguments will be accepted. And if Trump translates his anti-alliance views and long-standing animus toward South Korea into policy, it will require a special level of courage by U.S. officials to push back against a man who appears to value personal fealty more importantly than loyalty to the alliance-related principles, ideas, and relationships that previous presidents have always treasured.",

And bodycam footage showed the moment authorities arrested the suspect on a highway about 50 miles from the golf course.\n\nA witness had tipped off police to a license plate number for the suspect's vehicle. He was identified as 58-year-old Ryan Wesley Routh. Officials recovered two backpacks and an SKS rifle with a scope, which were left behind on the outskirts of the golf course. And phone records show Routh spent nearly 12 hours near the property before being confronted.\n\nToday, Routh appeared in federal court, charged with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and a possession of a firearm with a destroyed serial number. If convicted, he could face anywhere from five to 15 years in prison.\n\nA look at public records and Routh social media history paints a picture of a once Trump supporter turned critic with a deep fixation Ukraine and its war with Russia. Routh self-published a 291-page book on Ukraine and global politics, where he talked about the end of his support for Trump.\n\nHe's been interviewed several times over recent years about his support for the Ukrainian war effort, and even traveled to Kyiv in 2022 in an attempt to join the front lines.",

In a video first reported by The New York Times, Lichtman explained that his prediction is based on a set of thirteen \"keys\" or true-false questions assessing the strength and performance of the incumbent party in the White House.\n\nWho is Allan Lichtman?\n\nBefore being named \"Distinguished Professor\" at American University in Washington, D.C., Lichtman earned a Ph.D. in modern American history and quantitative methods from Harvard. He has lectured globally, authored 13 books and hundreds of academic articles, and served as an expert witness in civil and voting rights cases. Lichtman is widely recognized for his political commentary and election forecasting.\n\nWhat are the 13 keys to a successful election campaign?\n\nThe keys include questions such as:\n\nDid the White House party gain House seats during the midterm elections?\n\nIs the sitting president running for reelection?\n\nIs the White House party avoiding a primary contest?\n\nIs there a third-party challenger?\n\nIs the short-term economy strong?\n\nHas long-term economic growth been as good as in the previous two terms?\n\nHas the White House party made major changes to national policy?\n\nIs there sustained social unrest during the term?\n\nIs the White House untainted by scandal, and is the incumbent party charismatic?\n\nIs the challenger uncharismatic?\n\nIs the incumbent charismatic?\n\nHas the White House party experienced a major failure in foreign policy?\n\nHas the White House party achieved foreign policy success?\n\nWhy did Allan Lichtman pick Harris?\n\nAccording to Lichtman, eight of the keys favor Harris, while three favor Trump. Lichtman notes that \"foreign policy is tricky, and these keys could flip.\" He added, \"The Biden administration is deeply invested in the war in Gaza, which is a humanitarian disaster with no end in sight. But even if both foreign policy keys flipped false, there would still be only five negative keys, which would not be enough for Donald Trump to regain the White House.\"\n\nAs a result, Lichtman predicts Harris will win.\n\nPresidential debate schedule: Will Kamala Harris and Donald Trump have more debates?\n\nHarris\u2019 team has agreed to a second debate before the November election, but the details are still uncertain. According to a statement from the Harris-Walz campaign, \u201cThe debate about debates is over. Donald Trump's campaign accepted our proposal for three debates \u2013 two presidential and one vice presidential.\u201d The statement added, \u201cAssuming Donald Trump actually shows up on September 10, Governor Walz will face JD Vance on October 1, and the American people will have another chance to see Vice President Harris and Donald Trump on the debate stage in October.\u201d\n\nPost primary:7 takeaways from Tuesday's Delaware primary election, including upsets and close races\n\nMore:Despite hailing from Sussex, Hall-Long loses county to Meyer in Delaware governor's race\n\nWhen is the vice presidential debate between JD Vance and Tim Walz?\n\nThe vice presidential debate will take place Oct. 1, with GOP nominee JD Vance and Democratic nominee Tim Walz, and will be hosted by CBS News.\n\nWhen is Election Day 2024?\n\nElection Day is Tuesday, Nov. 5, 2024.\n\nWhen is the deadline to register to vote in Delaware?\n\nThe voter registration deadline is the fourth Saturday before the general election.

        "text": "Amid USPS scrutiny, postmaster general says agency is prepared for election mail\nUSPS will go through \u2018extraordinary measures\u2019 between Oct. 21 and Nov. 15 to ensure mail-in ballots are counted on time.\n\nState election officials, members of Congress and former President Donald Trump are raising concerns about the Postal Service\u2019s ability to deliver mail-in ballots on time in November.\n\nPostmaster General Louis DeJoy however, is pushing back, telling state election officials USPS is well-equipped to handle mail-in ballots this election season.\n\nPostal worker unions are also defending USPS preparations for Election Day.\n\nDeJoy, in a letter to the National Association of State Election Directors and the National Association of Secretaries of State, said recent shakeups from USPS network modernization \u201cwill not have an impact on Election Mail, and we have committed to limit network changes to avoid any unintended disruption in service for the upcoming election and peak season.\u201d\n\nUSPS saw regional drops in on-time mail delivery in areas where it opened massive new mail processing, called Regional Processing and Distribution Centers.\n\nHowever, the agency is putting some of its network modernization changes on hold until at least January 2025.\n\n\u201cYou can rest assured that along with the entire United States Postal Service, I am personally fully committed to effective implementation of our longstanding processes and procedures designed to ensure that all ballot mail is delivered in a timely and secure manner,\u201d DeJoy wrote in a letter sent last Friday.\n\nThe groups told USPS in a letter last week that over the past year, including this year\u2019s primary elections, local election offices received mailed ballots days after the deadline to be counted \u2014 even though they were postmarked on time.\n\n\u201cWe implore you to take immediate and tangible corrective action to address the ongoing performance issues with USPS election mail service,\u201d the groups wrote to DeJoy. \u201cFailure to do so will risk limiting voter participation and trust in the election process.\u201d\n\nDeJoy wrote in his response that USPS is delivering mail, on average, within 2.7 days, and that \u201celection mail routinely outperforms our regular service performance due to our long-standing processes and procedures.\u201d\n\nDeJoy told the groups that voters should mail their ballots before Election Day, at least one week prior to their state\u2019s deadline.\n\n\u201cAs you know, we take any reports of delayed election mail seriously and work to solve problems, even when it turns out that they are not the responsibility of the Postal Service,\u201d DeJoy wrote.\n\nUSPS, as it does every ahead of every election, will deploy \u201cextraordinary measures,\u201d which include advancing election mail ahead of other mail during processing, running extra truck trips between facilities and daily \u201call clear\u201d checks to ensure all election mail is accounted for in the system.\n\nUSPS officials told reporters in a press briefing last month that those extraordinary measures will begin Oct. 21 and run through Nov. 15.\n\n\u201cThe measures are not intended to compensation for general operational deficiencies, to the extent that such deficiencies exist, and in fact if they were implemented too early that would likely be counterproductive,\u201d DeJoy said.\n\nUSPS, he added, recently identified several flawed ballot envelope designs and related issues that caused ballot mail to \u201cloop within our system or to be incorrectly delivered or returned to sender.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn those cases, when election officials bring concerns to our attention, or when we discover the issues on our own, we are able to work with election officials to ensure their ballot envelopes and addressing conform with our best practice recommendations that we consistently share with election officials to ensure effective use of the mail,\u201d DeJoy wrote.\n\nWhile the vast majority of election mail is collected and delivered locally \u2014 and doesn\u2019t travel extensively through the USPS network \u2014 agency officials said told reporters they are also prepared to deliver overseas ballots from military and diplomatic personnel on time.\n\nIn the 2020 general election, USPS delivered 99.9% of ballots from voters to election officials within seven days, and matched that level of performance for the 2022 midterm elections.\n\nUSPS delivered about 97% to 98% of election and political mail on time between December 2023 and April 2024.\n\nDave Lewis, president of the postal metrics company SnailWorks, recently told Federal News Network that USPS is well positioned to handle mail-in ballots ahead of Election Day. It\u2019s everything else broadly categorized as \u201celection mail\u201d that may put a strain on the agency.\n\n\u201cThat means, the \u2018Vote for me\u2019\u2019 stuff, the candidates\u2019 mail, and that will be billions and billions of pieces mailed in the next three months,\u201d Lewis said last month. \u201cThere are billions of pieces of that, and that\u2019s what\u2019s clogs the system up. That may get in the way of some of the ballots. That concerns me.\u201d\n\nAmong recent improvements, DeJoy said USPS has transitioned to a new electronic election and political mail \u201call clear\u201d log, making it easier to track how facilities are keeping up with standard election mail procedures.\n\nThe Postal Inspection Service, the law enforcement branch of USPS, is also conducting ongoing election mail inspections in processing facilities and post offices.\n\nAside from state election officials, former President Donald Trump has cast doubts on the Postal Service\u2019s ability to deliver mail-in ballots ahead of Election Day.\n\nTrump, postal unions weigh in on election mail\n\nTrump, in a post on the social media platform Truth Social, wrote on Sunday that \u201cUnited States Postal Service has admitted that it is a poorly run mess that is experiencing mail loss and delays at a level never seen before.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith this being the FACT, how can we possibly be expected to allow or trust the U.S. Postal Service to run the 2024 Presidential Election? It is not possible for them to do so. HELP!\u201d Trump wrote.\n\nTrump also questioned USPS delivery of mail-in ballots during the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe National Rural Letter Carriers Association, in response to Trump\u2019s post, tweeted Sunday that \u201crural carriers across the country are ready to deliver for the upcoming U.S. presidential election in November.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe 655,000 hardworking men and women of the Postal Service are dedicated to ensuring excellence when it comes to delivering for the American people. Rural letter carriers have been safely and securely delivering mail-in ballots for decades, including millions of ballots in 2020 and 2022.\u201d\n\nDemocratic lawmakers, however, also share concerns about the Postal Service\u2019s performance.\n\nSen. Tina Smith (D-Minn.) tweeted on Sept. 12 that \u201cPostmaster General DeJoy needs to make sure postal delays are not an issue in this election.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe most important responsibility of the Postal Service is delivering mail-in ballots. They have to get it right \u2014 millions of Americans\u2019 votes are in their hands,\u201d Smith wrote.\n\nIn response to Smith\u2019s post, Brian Renfroe, national president of the National Association of Letter Carriers, said postal workers are prepared for the election season.\n\n\u201cSenator, what you don\u2019t have to worry about are the 650,000 employees of the Postal Service continuing to dutifully do their jobs with integrity,\u201d he posted.\n\nRenfroe also urged lawmakers to do more to put USPS on firmer financial footing.\n\n\u201cElected leaders should do their jobs & make policy changes to fix problems they created & keep the Postal Service financially stable,\u201d Renfroe wrote.\n\nUSPS is generally self-funded by its own revenue, and is pursuing several network modernization changes, in an effort to cut billions in annual operating costs.\n\nBoth Democrats and Republicans in Congress, however, have grown frustrated with these plans, saying they have led to slower mail delivery.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Federal News Network.

        "text": "Elon Musk has often inflamed politically tense moments, raising worries for the US election\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Hours after an apparent attempt on Donald Trump\u2019s life over the weekend, Elon Musk took to his social platform X to post a thinking emoji and a comment that \u201cno one is even trying to assassinate\u201d the Democratic president and vice president.\n\nIn the midst of anti-Muslim riots in the U.K. \u2014 which were ginned up by a false rumor \u2014 Musk declared that \u201ccivil war is inevitable\u201d in the country.\n\nAnd when an anonymous X user distorted data to claim a surge in sketchy voter registrations in three U.S. states, Musk amplified the false post and called it \u201cextremely concerning.\u201d\n\nAll three posts sparked quick backlash from public officials who called Musk\u2019s words irresponsible and misleading. As his words amass millions of views and thousands of shares, they also illustrate the ability of one of the world\u2019s most influential people to spread fear, hate and misinformation during fraught political moments around the world. That\u2019s especially true because he owns the social platform that used to be Twitter, giving Musk the authority to shape how its content reaches users.\n\nMusk\u2019s inaccurate posts to his 200 million followers along with his site\u2019s lack of guardrails are raising concerns about how he could manipulate public trust as Election Day in the U.S. draws nearer. He recently endorsed Trump\u2019s presidential bid and has become more personally invested in politics \u2014 even agreeing to lead a government efficiency commission if Trump wins reelection.\n\nTrump gave a shoutout to Musk during an event on X Monday evening, basking in the tech billionaire\u2019s endorsement and referring to him as his \u201cfriend.\u201d Musk did not reply to an emailed request for comment.\n\nWhat to know about Trump\u2019s second term:\n\nStaffing the administration: Here are the people Trump has picked recess appointments Follow all of our coverage as Donald Trump assembles his second administration.\n\nAt the very least, experts and election officials worry that Musk could influence people to question the legitimacy of the vote. But they also are concerned his words could motivate threats and violence against election workers or candidates.\n\n\u201cX and Musk are raising the temperature of politics dangerously and irresponsibly at a critical moment,\u201d said Heidi Beirich, co-founder of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism. \u201cIt\u2019s shameful.\u201d\n\nThe 53-year-old billionaire who bought and transformed Twitter in 2022 has modeled his social media site as a marketplace of ideas where people can speak freely without censorship, a move that has been cheered by many conservatives. He often has touted X as a superior news source to the mainstream media, one where users can post without fear and discern the \u201ctruth.\u201d\n\nYet the changes Musk has made to the company over two years also have allowed false information to spread largely unchecked.\n\nHe has dismantled the company\u2019s Trust and Safety advisory group and stopped enforcing content moderation and hate speech rules that the site followed before his takeover. He has restored the accounts of conspiracy theorists, incentivized engagement on the platform with payouts and content partnerships, and instituted a Community Notes feature that at times results in misleading comments being placed on posts.\n\nBaseless claims from both sides of the political spectrum rack up thousands of shares on Musk\u2019s X. After a gunman shot Trump in the ear in an attempted assassination in Pennsylvania, far-left users shared false conspiracy theories that the former president had set it up. And after the debate between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, far-right users spread a bogus claim that Harris was wearing an earpiece.\n\nRick Hasen, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, said Musk has degraded the site so that it\u2019s just a shadow of what it was in 2020, when it was regarded as a fairly reliable clearinghouse for information.\n\n\u201cTwitter, or X, has a very different public reputation now. There\u2019s a reason millions of people left the platform and advertisers left,\u201d Hasen said. \u201cHe\u2019s spreading terrible messages. ... The question is will the marketplace of ideas work well enough\u201d that people will recognize those messages as untrustworthy, Hasen added.\n\nMusk and many Republicans disagree with that sentiment. They say the site under its previous ownership unfairly censored accurate information about COVID-19\u2019s origins and President Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden when the facts were not immediately available.\n\nMusk uses his platform to post about his companies Tesla and SpaceX, to share his personal views that more people need to be having children, and to make jokes in response to memes and other content that he finds entertaining. He also has increasingly used the site to amplify unfounded claims from politicians, including that Democrats are \u201cimporting\u201d migrants into the country to vote and that Haitian migrants in Ohio are killing and eating pets.\n\nJocelyn Benson, Michigan\u2019s Democratic secretary of state, said in an interview earlier this month that Musk\u2019s election postings have created a \u201cmaelstrom of disinformation\u201d that makes it harder for those who run elections to empower voters with the facts.\n\n\u201cI know the vast majority of election administrators just try to keep their heads down and do the work,\u201d she said. \u201cThe challenge is, how do we get information about our work out to citizens, many of whom follow Musk or are members of X, or on the platform?\u201d\n\nSome election officials have tried engaging with Musk directly to educate him and his followers. In July, the Republican recorder responsible for elections in Maricopa County, Arizona, which includes Phoenix, invited Musk through an X post to an all-access tour of the county\u2019s election facility.\n\nMinnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon, a Democrat, organized a letter to Musk with four other secretaries of state this summer when Musk\u2019s AI platform, Grok, was posting incorrect information about election rules. He said Musk deserved credit for belatedly correcting that misinformation.\n\nSimon said that before Musk bought Twitter, the platform was helpful in correcting election misinformation and that he hopes Musk can do the same, whatever his personal beliefs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one thing if you don\u2019t like this election system or that election system in Minnesota,\u201d Simon said, but factually false information about voting needs to be fixed.\n\nJen Easterly, director of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, also commented last month on one of Musk\u2019s posts to correct a misconception that most elections in the U.S. don\u2019t use paper ballots. She wrote that during the last presidential election in 2020, \u201call States w/close presidential vote counts actually used paper records, allowing votes to be counted, recounted, & audited to ensure accuracy.\u201d\n\nThe X owner has at times backtracked when he recognizes his posts were ill-advised. Earlier this month, he sparked outrage when one of his posts promoted an interview between the right-wing podcast host Tucker Carlson and a Holocaust revisionist. He then deleted it.\n\nMusk also deleted Sunday\u2019s post musing about how Biden and Harris had not been targeted by assassination attempts. White House spokesperson Andrew Bates nonetheless responded to call the post \u201cirresponsible\u201d and to say violence \u201cshould only be condemned, never encouraged or joked about.\u201d\n\nSiva Vaidhyanathan, a professor of media studies at the University of Virginia, said most celebrities are careful about their words, recognizing that not everyone will understand their jokes or respond in a measured way. Musk, he said, has never had that kind of filter.\n\nEven so, Vaidhyanathan said Musk\u2019s influence might be overblown when it comes to political misinformation. His platform has lost money and advertisers, and he\u2019s only one of many figures who have long made false claims about elections.\n\n\u201cMusk is just one more voice in that cacophony,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Christina A.

        "text": "Native Americans fight barriers to voting, 100 years after being recognized as U.S. citizens\nChristopher Lomahquahu and Eshaan Sarup, News21\n\nWOLF POINT, Mont. \u2013 Louise Smith sits at her daughter\u2019s dining room table on the Fort Peck Indian Reservation, poring over photographs and newspaper clippings \u2013 the everyday scraps that weave a tapestry of her 101 years of life.\n\nShe revisits the decades she spent as an Indian Health Service nurse; her retirement to care for her husband, Buck, before he died; and how, late in life, she was named the grand marshal at a parade this year marking the 100th anniversary of the Indian Citizenship Act.\n\nWith an umbrella in hand to shield her from rain, she rode the parade route in a convertible clad with a banner that read: \u201cMontana\u2019s Oldest Native American Voter.\u201d\n\nThe Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 took effect nine months after Smith was born, recognizing Native Americans as U.S. citizens and, on paper, extending the privileges of citizenship to them. Yet for decades, states continued to block Indigenous people from voting.\n\nUtah considered anyone living on tribal lands nonresidents and ineligible to vote. Other states, including Arizona, barred people under guardianship from registering to vote and used a court case that likened the relationship between tribal nations and the U.S. to that of \u201ca ward to his guardian\u201d to enforce that ban against Native Americans.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until Smith was in her 40s that the federal government overruled state laws and guaranteed Indigenous people the right to vote by way of the 1965 Voting Rights Act.\n\nEven now, Smith still casts a ballot every election. \u201cIt\u2019s important,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause you want to know who you\u2019re voting for or what they\u2019re supposed to do for you after you get them in.\n\n\u201cWe all should be voting, you know?\u201d\n\nToday, though, experts warn that some states are once again restricting Native Americans\u2019 access to voting \u2013 even as a few, including Nevada, work alongside tribal nations to expand their ability to participate in democracy.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve consistently been bringing new cases every year,\u201d said Jacqueline De Leo\u0301n, a senior staff attorney at the Native American Rights Fund (NARF), which provides legal assistance to the nation\u2019s 574 federally recognized tribes and has brought numerous lawsuits over voting rights violations. \u201cThere\u2019s more cases than we have the capacity to cover.\u201d\n\nThose cases include a battle to ensure Native Americans in Thurston County, Nebraska \u2013 where more than 50% of residents are Indigenous \u2013 have an equal shot at representation on the Board of Supervisors.\n\nAnd one in North Dakota, where lawyers for years have fought state officials over electoral maps that courts say discriminate against Native Americans.\n\nAnd yet another in Arizona, where the Tohono O\u2019odham Nation and the Gila River Indian Community sued over a law requiring voters registering for federal elections to provide proof of residency using a physical address. A judge last year struck down the requirement after advocates noted homes on tribal land often have no address.\n\nSome experts blame these recent efforts on changes to the federal Voting Rights Act. In 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a section of the act that forced some counties and states to get clearance before changing election procedures, a mandate intended to protect against discrimination.\n\nSince that ruling, efforts to suppress the vote have increased, said voting rights attorney Patty Ferguson-Bohnee, who directs the Indian Legal Program at Arizona State University\u2019s Sandra Day O\u2019Connor College of Law.\n\n\u201cNow you can pass all kinds of laws without being precleared,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s been an erosion of voting rights over time \u2026 and it\u2019s really up to Congress to do something.\u201d\n\nIn 2021, President Joe Biden directed a steering group to study voting barriers Indigenous voters face, and the resulting report included several recommendations for state and federal lawmakers \u2013 including a push to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. Named for the late congressman and civil rights leader, the bill includes provisions specific to Indigenous voters.\n\nIn July, a congressional committee published another report that found Indigenous voters \u201ccontinue to face persistent and substantial barriers to the right to vote in federal, state and local elections.\u201d Its author, U.S. Rep. Joseph Morelle, D-N.Y., said he hoped a better understanding of the problems would compel Congress to take \u201cstrong action\u201d to protect Indigenous voting rights.\n\nAdvocates describe the Lewis Voting Rights Act as a revitalization of the landmark 1965 law and argue it would restore needed protections against discriminatory practices that target Native Americans and other voters of color. The bill, however, continues to languish in committee.\n\nRestrictions in Big Sky Country\n\nSome 2,000 miles from the nation\u2019s capital, the Fort Peck Reservation is tucked amid expansive grassy plains and cattle pastures a five-hour drive from Montana\u2019s largest city, Billings.\n\nThe Assiniboine and Sioux peoples called this land home for centuries before European settlers arrived. While they once traded bison meat and horses, the tribes now rely on metal fabrication, production sewing and other industrial activities to bolster their economies.\n\nThe original inhabitants of Montana left their mark on politics, too. In 1932, Assiniboine woman Dolly Akers became the first Native American elected to the state Legislature. And each year since 1989, at least one American Indian has held a seat in the state House or Senate.\n\nThe state is home to about 73,000 Indigenous people, constituting 6.4% of the population. Nevertheless, the Republican-controlled Legislature has joined other states in passing restrictive measures that advocates say harm Native American voters.\n\nDubbed \u201celection security bills\u201d by Republicans, the measures were approved in the wake of unproven allegations of fraud during the 2020 election. One eliminated same-day voter registration; the other did away with third-party ballot collection.\n\nAfter advocacy group Western Native Voice and tribes including the Blackfeet Nation and the Fort Belknap Indian Community sued, the state Supreme Court in March found the laws unconstitutional, saying they made it \u201cmuch more difficult \u2026 for people living on reservations\u201d to get to a polling place or mail an absentee ballot.\n\nAt the time of the ruling, Ronnie Jo Horse, executive director of Western Native Voice, said it reinforced \u201cthe principle of equitable access to voting services and the protection of the rights for all voters, especially those residing on reservations where voting barriers are much higher.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with News21, Horse said she\u2019d like Montana lawmakers to make an effort to visit Indigenous communities to see firsthand the voting challenges they face.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping that representatives are more open to coming to Native communities to really understand what the environment is and the lengths that we have to travel,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we can all come together and discuss things, there\u2019s more that we have in common than (not).\u201d\n\nDespite attacks on their voting rights, leaders on the Fort Peck Reservation are focused on getting people to the polls and encouraging the next generation to get more civically engaged.\n\nSmith recalls taking young voters to the polls to encourage them to get involved in democracy and exercise a right their forebearers fought long and hard to secure.\n\n\u201cMy friend and I used to take them in her car. Some don\u2019t have rides,\u201d she said, adding that even today, \u201cI visit all my grandkids sometimes when it\u2019s voting time to ask them if they voted already.\u201d\n\nFort Peck Tribal Executive Board member Wayne Martell has done the same. \u201cYou have to go knock on their door, and you have to sit there, and you have to educate them,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to educate them to how the policy personally affects them.\u201d\n\nAt 72, Martell has long seen how lawmakers and special interest groups create hardships for Indigenous people. He said voting is about giving his people the power to choose leaders who will make decisions in the best interests of Native Americans.\n\nHe points to health care as one example.\n\nAfter COVID-era Medicaid waivers ended, more than 100,000 Montanans \u2013 including more than 12,000 with a tribal affiliation \u2013 lost health coverage, according to state data. This November, Montana voters will decide their next governor, along with how the state\u2019s Medicaid situation will be handled.\n\nOther state races, including that of Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Tester, could be decided by such a small margin that Native American turnout would be the factor. In 2006, Tester won by about 3,500 votes, and campaign officials attributed that \u2013 and his re-election in 2012 \u2013 to Indigenous voters.\n\nIn March, the state Democratic Party launched a multimillion-dollar campaign focused on turning out the Indigenous vote.\n\n\u201cIndian Country is facing tough battles in 2024, and the outcome of this election couldn\u2019t be more important,\u201d Cinda Burd-Ironmaker, the party\u2019s Native vote political director and a member of the Blackfeet Nation, said in a news release announcing the initiative.\n\n\u201cFrom honoring tribal sovereignty, to improving health care delivery, to combating the missing and murdered Indigenous people crisis,\u201d she added, \u201cwe deserve elected officials who will fight for us and be our partner.\u201d\n\nImproving access in the Silver State\n\nIn stark contrast to Montana, Nevada\u2019s 28 tribal nations have made great strides toward making voting more accessible for members.\n\nIn 2016, members of the Walker River and Pyramid Lake Paiute tribes filed a lawsuit alleging their constitutional rights had been violated because state and county officials failed to establish in-person polling places on their lands \u2013 forcing members to travel 70 to 96 miles round trip just to vote.\n\nThe tribes won \u2013 and soon after, the Inter-Tribal Council of Nevada sought additional satellite polling places for nine additional tribes. Those efforts proved largely successful.\n\nThis November, Nevada tribes will have 16 local polling stations \u2013 including at the Walker River Paiute tribal courthouse in Schurz and the Pyramid Lake Paiute tribal administration building in Nixon.\n\n\u201cBecause of the push from people \u2013 not only here on our reservation, but the surrounding Native communities \u2013 we\u2019ve been able to create equal voting rights,\u201d said Walker River Chairwoman Andrea Martinez.\n\nThat push continued during the COVID-19 pandemic, when it became essential to provide Nevada\u2019s many rural residents \u2013 including Indigenous voters \u2013 the ability to vote safely.\n\nA law enacted before the 2020 election ensured all registered voters automatically received a mail-in ballot. It also allowed someone other than the voter to collect and turn in a ballot \u2013 a process Republicans call \u201cballot harvesting\u201d but advocates say helps disabled and elderly people and other voters who lack the means to get to a polling place.\n\nThose provisions helped increase turnout among Native American voters in the state that year by 25% compared with the 2016 election, according to an analysis by the group All Voting is Local Nevada.\n\nIn 2021, the state\u2019s Democratic governor signed a measure making those pandemic-era provisions permanent and extending the deadline by which tribes could request a polling place on tribal land.\n\nThen last summer, Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo signed yet another bill, requiring the state to allow Indigenous people living on tribal land to use an electronic system called EASE to register to vote or cast a ballot.\n\n\u201cNevada has obviously been responsive to a lot of push by tribal communities to make voting easier,\u201d said Steven Wadsworth, chairman of the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe, located northeast of Reno.\n\nStacey Montooth, executive director of the Nevada Indian Commission and a citizen of the Walker River Paiute Tribe, said all of these successes are due to leaders in Nevada \u2013 and the nation \u2013 recognizing the growing power of Native Americans.\n\nAcross the U.S., the Native American population grew by almost 12% from 2010 to 2020, according to census data. As for those who identify as Native American in combination with another race or ethnicity, that population nearly doubled.\n\nMore than 54,000 people who identify solely as American Indian live in Nevada. That\u2019s about 1.7% of the population \u2013 enough to make a difference in a tight race.\n\nIn 2020, Biden beat then-President Donald Trump in neighboring Arizona by just 10,457 votes, and many credit increased turnout among Native American voters as a key factor. Yet the state\u2019s 22 federally recognized tribes still face unique barriers to voting.\n\n\u201cThe demands of each of those groups are very different \u2014 and they operate in different spaces, in different places,\u201d said Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes.\n\nFor example, election officials use a helicopter to fly equipment to the bottom of the Grand Canyon to ensure the Havasupai Tribe can cast ballots. And some Navajo Nation residents must travel nearly 150 miles round trip to vote.\n\nFontes acknowledged that in the past, officials sought to intentionally prevent Indigenous people from voting. Now, he said, the main issue is a lack of funding by the state and counties where tribal lands are located.\n\n\u201cThey use words like \u2018sacred\u2019 when it comes to voting,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they don\u2019t want to pay for it.\u201d\n\nIn Nevada, Montooth said the growing power of Native Americans and efforts to collaborate more closely with state officials have made a difference \u2013 \u201cnot just with voting services, but with all the essential services that the state of Nevada provides.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at a point now where plans are not made, policies are not implemented, without someone saying: What about the first people of this land?\u201d she said. \u201cThings are definitely improving, but don\u2019t be fooled. We still have a lot of work to do.\u201d\n\nThat work includes ongoing battles over voting access.\n\nIn the past two years, the voting rights group Four Directions has had to fight for a polling location for Nevada\u2019s Yomba Shoshone Tribe and equal voting access for the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes.\n\nAnd other barriers remain. For example, a lack of internet connectivity in some Indigenous communities makes the new EASE system impossible for many to access.\n\nOne of the biggest obstacles, advocates say, is low engagement among Native American voters \u2013 younger ones in particular. A 2020 report by the Native Americans Right Fund found more than 1.5 million eligible Native American voters were not registered.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not surprising that people don\u2019t see (the electoral process) as something that they want to participate in, because they\u2019re being told in a million different ways that it\u2019s not for them,\u201d said De Leo\u0301n, who co-authored that 2020 report.\n\n\u201cWe get hit with this label of \u2018apathy,\u2019 when in reality what we have is a bunch of compounding difficulties that are telling us the system is not for us,\u201d she said. \u201cAll of these combined factors are what make it difficult for Natives to vote and, also, indicate how much power is at stake.\u201d\n\nThis report is part of \u201cFractured,\u201d an examination of the state of American democracy produced by Carnegie-Knight News21.

He continued to write pieces in office for publications like The New York Times and the Washington Post.\n\nThe endorsement gained additional traction online after it was shared on X by Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt. The mayor hasn't officially endorsed a presidential candidate, but he's publicly criticized Republican nominee Donald Trump.\n\nWhat did Mickey Edwards say about Kamala Harris, Donald Trump?\n\nIn the piece published by The Philadelphia Inquirer, Edwards urged Americans to vote for Harris due to the importance of foreign policy.\n\nHe wrote that U.S. allies cannot trust Trump, adding that countries like China, Russia and North Korea are authoritarian and could buy a Trump administration through flattery.\n\nHarris works across the aisle, Edwards wrote, and is a potential president that Western leaders will respect. Edwards wrote that the Americans needs a serious person to lead the country as tyrants threaten the U.S. and its allies.",

        "text": "Assassination attempts, pets and Taylor Swift: the US election is wild\nBefore Biden dropped out of the 2024 ticket, multiple national polls had the president trailing Trump (who had recently survived an assassination attempt) by only 1 or 2 percentage points. And before Harris\u2019 successful debate last week, the race was even closer, with various polls showing Harris closely behind Trump, tied with Trump, or even slightly ahead of the former president.\n\nIn the same way the July 13 assassination attempt saw Trump\u2019s approval rating increasing by less than 2 percentage points, the polls after Harris\u2019 debate performance appear to have on average only shifted in her favour by less than a single percentange point.\n\nHalf a year ago \u2013 and many political lifetimes before any of these events occurred \u2013 Trump averaged an approval rating of 47 percent. Today, that number is exactly the same. His approval has yet to go below 44 percent or above 49 percent over the past half year \u2013 essentially remaining within the margin of error. In other words, regardless of events, views of Trump \u2013 much like views of Harris and Biden \u2013 will likely remain largely unchanged.\n\nA once-in-a-century pandemic, an insurrection, criminal convictions and even an assassination attempt may feel seismic to Americans \u2013 and those outside looking in \u2013 but the calcification of US political polarisation remains.\n\nHowever, given the slimmest of margins for the last two presidential elections \u2013 a total of 0.03 percent of Americans decided the 2020 election \u2013 even the most seemingly inconsequential events may prove decisive.",

        "text": "Why does AP call US elections?\nThe Definitive Source Industry Insights Why does AP call US elections? For 178 years, The Associated Press has played a vital role in U.S. elections, counting the vote and declaring the winners \u2013 and reporting them to the world, without fear or favor.\n\nWith a history of accuracy dating to our first vote count in 1848, AP remains the go-to source for trustworthy and reliable information every election night.\n\nSenior Vice President and Executive Editor Julie Pace explains why AP calls U.S. elections and the preparations underway as Election Day approaches:\n\nWhy does AP call U.S. elections in the first place?\n\nElections in the United States are administered at the state and local level. That means there is no federal body that counts the vote or shares results. The AP stepped in to help fill that void more than 170 years ago, shortly after our founding. The goal was to ensure the public had an independent, non-partisan source of information on elections \u2013 and that\u2019s the role AP continues to play, nearly two centuries later.\n\nBusy scene at the offices of The Associated Press in New York as tabulators gather to count the vote, which arrived by telegraph, Nov. 3, 1914. (AP Photo).\n\nWhat is AP doing to prepare for the 2024 elections? How is the process similar \u2013 or different \u2013 compared to 2020?\n\nThe fundamentals of our approach to the 2024 election are unchanged. Our priority is ensuring we\u2019re well-positioned to declare winners in races up and down the ballot with speed, and of course, accuracy. Our decision team has had plenty of practice this year during the busy primary season, which has helped them fine tune their workflows, communication and modeling. As Election Day nears, they\u2019re paying particular attention to the battleground states in the presidential race and competitive House and Senate contests, ensuring we\u2019re up to speed on any changes in voting rules and procedures in those locations.\n\nWe\u2019re also placing a particular emphasis in 2024 on our explanatory journalism around our race calls and vote count. We plan to be more transparent than ever about how we\u2019ve called key races, which is part of our effort to help build public confidence in election results. We know that the process can be confusing, so we think it\u2019s important to show people what went into our decisions. We\u2019ve also significantly expanded our data visualization around elections, which will provide audiences with an immersive digital experience on Election Day and beyond.\n\nWhy should people trust AP to get it right?\n\nNo news organization has been calling elections longer than the AP. That depth of experience, combined with our gold standard record of accuracy and our non-partisan approach to news coverage should give the public confidence in our race calls. Our motivations are simple: we want to get the calls right and we want to inform the public quickly. We have no political agenda or rooting interest in the outcome of the elections. We are focused on the facts and delivering the results accurately.",

But starting in August, influence campaigns the company has been tracking began to churn out content about Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"The shift to focusing on the Harris-Walz campaign reflects a strategic move by Russian actors aimed at exploiting any perceived vulnerabilities in the new candidates,\" Clint Watts, the general manager of the Threat Analysis Center, wrote in a blog post accompanying the report.\n\nIn recent weeks, the U.S. government has stepped up its efforts to call out and disrupt Russian influence operations targeting American voters that intelligence officials say are aimed at helping former President Donald Trump regain the White House.\n\nThe Microsoft report identified a number of recent Russia-linked campaigns that have shifted focus to Harris. That included a baseless claim accusing Harris of being involved in a hit-and-run in 2011 that was spread via a website claiming to be a local San Francisco TV station. The article was accompanied by a video in which a woman, whom Microsoft identified as an actor, claimed to be the victim of the crash. There is no evidence any such incident occurred, and the purported TV station does not exist.\n\nMicrosoft said the video and its laundering through a sham news site was consistent with the tactics of an influence operation it has tracked in previous reports. Researchers at the misinformation-tracking company NewsGuard have linked that operation to a former deputy sheriff from Florida who now lives in Moscow.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAnother inauthentic video Microsoft attributed to the same operation appeared to depict \"an attack by alleged Harris supporters on what the video\u2019s amplifiers claim is a Trump rally attendee.\" It racked up millions of views.\n\nMicrosoft attributed other videos pushing conspiracy theories and falsehoods about Harris\u2019s policies to a separate Russian influence operation that previously aimed to spread fear around the Paris Olympics.\n\nOne video, purporting to show a fake billboard in Times Square with false claims about Harris, was posted on a Telegram channel that claimed the phone message was commissioned by Trump supporters \"to troll the Democrats.\" It was viewed more than 100,000 times on the social media site X, formerly Twitter, within four hours of being posted on Telegram, Microsoft said.\n\nA third influence campaign noted in the report \"continues to operate covert social media channels that target US audiences.\" It amplifies materials obtained by Russian-linked hackers and posts fake investigations, alongside attacks on Harris and posts about the U.S. southern border.\n\nThe operations will likely ramp up their attacks on the Harris-Walz campaign in the run-up to Election Day, Microsoft said.\n\nIran and China are also seeking to sway U.S. voters, Microsoft said, echoing assessments by federal intelligence officials and researchers at other companies.",

        "text": "Election Day in the US is approaching fast. Early voters have already started casting their ballots\nThe voting window for the Nov. 5 presidential election is now open. Early in-person voting started Friday in three states, after absentee ballots began going to voters last week.\n\nHere is a look at some key developments in the roughly six weeks remaining until Election Day.\n\nWho\u2019s ready to vote?\n\nThe first batch of ballots typically sent out are ones to military and overseas voters. Under federal law, that must happen at least 45 days before an election \u2014 which this year is Saturday, Sept. 21.\n\nSome states start earlier.\n\nElection offices in North Carolina had been scheduled to begin sending mail ballots to all voters who requested them on Sept. 6, which would have made it the first state to begin distributing ballots. But that was delayed because presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. successfully sued to have his name removed from the state\u2019s ballot after he suspended his campaign and endorsed Trump. That allowed Alabama to become the first state to send out absentee ballots for the presidential election cycle.\n\nNorth Carolina\u2019s 100 counties were finally able to send absentee ballots to military and overseas voters on Friday, Sept. 20.\n\nVoter registration deadlines vary by state, with most falling between eight and 30 days before the election, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. The deadline is Oct. 7 in Georgia, one of this year\u2019s most prominent presidential battlegrounds.\n\nNearly all states offer some version of in-person voting, though the rules and dates vary considerably. Minnesota, South Dakota and Virginia kicked off early in-person voting on Friday.\n\nThe gloves come off\n\nThe first presidential debate between Democratic nominee Kamala Harris and Republican nominee Donald Trump is over, and a second debate appears doubtful after Trump ruled out the possibility.\n\nHarris\u2019 pick for vice president, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, and Trump\u2019s, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, have agreed to an Oct. 1 debate hosted by CBS News in New York City.\n\nA possible criminal sentence for Trump\n\nTrump had been scheduled to be sentenced Sept. 18 in his hush money criminal case, but that has now been delayed until after the election.\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyers had argued that holding the sentencing as originally scheduled, about seven weeks before Election Day, would amount to election interference.\n\nTrump was convicted in May on 34 counts of falsifying business records to conceal a $130,000 hush money payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels just before the 2016 presidential election. Falsifying business records is punishable by up to four years in prison. Other potential sentences include probation, a fine or a conditional discharge that would require Trump to stay out of trouble to avoid additional punishment.\n\nNext steps in Trump\u2019s other New York cases\n\nThe 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments Sept. 6 in Trump\u2019s appeal of a jury\u2019s verdict last year ordering him to pay $5 million to writer E. Jean Carroll after it found him liable for sexually assaulting and defaming her. Trump also is appealing a verdict in a second trial in January in which a jury found him liable on additional defamation claims and ordered him to pay Carroll $83.3 million.\n\nOn Sept. 26, a New York appeals court will hear oral arguments in Trump\u2019s challenge of a nearly $500 million civil fraud judgment in state Attorney General Letitia James\u2019 lawsuit against him. The court typically rules about a month after arguments, meaning a decision could come before the November election.\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyers argue that a judge\u2019s Feb. 16 finding that the former president lied for years about his wealth as he built his real estate empire was \u201cerroneous\u201d and \u201cegregious.\u201d State lawyers responded in court papers that there\u2019s \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d to support the verdict.\n\nWhat about Trump\u2019s election and document cases?\n\nA state case in Georgia that charged Trump and 18 others in a wide-ranging scheme to overturn his 2020 loss in the state is stalled with no chance of going to trial before the election.\n\nFederal prosecutors have brought two criminal cases against Trump, but one was dismissed by a judge last month and the other is likely to be reshaped by the recent U.S. Supreme Court opinion that conferred broad immunity on former presidents for official acts they take in office.\n\nSpecial counsel Jack Smith has appealed the dismissal by U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon of an indictment charging Trump with hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and obstructing the FBI\u2019s efforts to get them back. But even if a federal appeals court reinstates the case and reverses the judge\u2019s ruling that Smith\u2019s appointment was unconstitutional, there\u2019s no chance of a trial taking place this year.\n\nIn light of the Supreme Court\u2019s immunity ruling, a federal judge in Washington is now tasked with deciding which allegations in a separate case charging Trump with plotting to overturn the 2020 election can remain part of the prosecution and which ones must be discarded. Deciding which acts are official and which are not is likely to be an arduous process.\n\nFights over voting and the election\n\nBefore the first ballots were even cast, both camps had been gearing up to fight over voting.\n\nBattles over election rules have become a staple of American democracy, but they\u2019re expected to reach new heights this year.\n\nGeorgia, a state Trump narrowly lost in 2020, has become a particular concern for Democrats. A new majority aligned with Trump on the Georgia State Election Board has been making significant changes to the state\u2019s election rules that could affect certification and lead to chaos within election offices that might delay final results.\n\nTrump installed his own leadership team at the Republican National Committee, including a director of election integrity who helped him try to overturn Biden\u2019s win in 2020. The RNC has filed a blizzard of lawsuits challenging voting rules and promises that more are on the way\n\nDemocrats also are mobilizing and assembling a robust legal team. Among other things, they are objecting to GOP efforts to remove some inactive voters or noncitizens from voter rolls, arguing that legal voters will get swept up in the purges.\n\nRepublicans have particularly escalated their rhetoric over the specter of noncitizens voting, even though repeated investigations have shown it almost never happens. Some also are pushing to give local election boards the ability to refuse to certify election results.\n\nAll indications are these efforts are laying the groundwork for Trump to again claim the election was stolen from him if he loses and to try to overturn the will of the voters. But there\u2019s no way to know if that will happen until the ballots are cast.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Kate Brumback and Christina A.

        "text": "China\u2019s influence campaign intensifies as US election nears\nAt first glance, Noah R. Smith might seem like your typical social media user. His bio says he\u2019s a father, a former \u201cTrack and Field representative,\u201d and a current member of the PanAm Sports organization.\n\nOn July 14, a day after the first assassination attempt on Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, Smith shared three posts from an account named \u201cTRUMP WON.\u201d\n\nOne post declared, \u201cAMERICA was attacked today \u2026 we must get it together. It\u2019s literally a matter of life and death,\u201d accompanied by an image depicting a divine hand halting a bullet aimed at Trump.\n\nAnother post urged \u201call MAGA GOD Fearing Patriots\u201d to connect, stating, \u201cGrow These Accounts, UNITED We Are Strong.\u201d\n\nWhile it might seem that Smith is a devoted Trump supporter, closer inspection suggests otherwise. His cover photo features Chinese watermarks, his profile picture is sourced from a company that provides photos, videos and music, and his bio is lifted from an authentic account named Laurel R. Smith.\n\nIn reality, Noah R. Smith is impersonating a U.S. voter who supports Trump. A joint investigation by VOA Mandarin and Doublethink Lab (DTL), a Taiwanese social media analytics firm, uncovered 10 such accounts on X.\n\nThese accounts are linked to China\u2019s Spamouflage network \u2014 a state-sponsored operation aimed at supporting the Chinese government and undermining its critics. This network was first identified by social media analytics company Graphika in 2019 and was used to target Hong Kong pro-democracy protesters at that time.\n\nFollowing the assassination attempt on July 14, the accounts began promoting pro-Trump content. Previously, they shared material consistent with Spamouflage\u2019s broader interests: defending China, criticizing U.S. foreign policy, and exploiting divisive domestic issues such as gun violence and racial tensions.\n\nDTL labeled this network of accounts posing as Americans \u201cMAGAflage 1,\u201d because they all seem to be promoting Trump\u2019s slogan \u201cMake America Great Again [MAGA].\u201d\n\n\u201cThe MAGAflage accounts are different because they are not just criticizing stuff. They are amplifying positive content about Trump,\u201d Jasper Hewitt, a digital intelligence analyst at Doublethink Lab, told VOA Mandarin.\n\nHe added that it\u2019s too early to draw conclusions about whom China is supporting, as researchers are still tracking accounts that criticize both Republican candidate Donald Trump and Democratic candidate Kamala Harris.\n\n\u201cEngaging with the MAGA movement, or any part of the political spectrum, might merely be a new attempt to generate authentic traffic,\u201d Hewitt told VOA.\n\nThe first MAGAflage network was discovered by Elise Thomas, a senior analyst at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, in April 2024. This network focuses on promoting positive content of Trump. She told VOA earlier that by wrapping a topic in a U.S. partisan political frame, these accounts got \u201ca reasonable amount of engagement from real American users.\u201d\n\nLimited influence\n\nThe VOA Mandarin investigation revealed that the accounts operate in coordination. Six out of the 10 accounts were created in 2015 but had their first visible posts on May 18 or May 19, 2022.\n\nThe batch accounts \u2014 the 10 new accounts \u2014 are not very active. Each account has roughly 100 posts or reposts over the last two years. The batch accounts were inactive for one year but were awoken after the first Trump assassination attempt.\n\nAdditionally, these accounts occasionally post or repost Chinese content.\n\nFor example, an account named Super-Rabbit shared praise for China's political and economic model from state-linked influencers like Shanghai Panda and Xinhua News Agency\u2019s reporter Li Zexin. One post from September 3 contrasted U.S. President Joe Biden\u2019s inactivity with China\u2019s President Xi Jinping\u2019s engagement in Africa.\n\n\u201cWhen Joe Biden is sitting on the beach wasted away, China\u2019s President Xi is shaking hands with various African leaders and making a better impact in Africa,\u201d the post said.\n\nVOA contacted the Trump and Harris campaigns for comment but did not receive a response as of publication time.\n\nLiu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, told VOA in a statement that \u201cChina has no intention and will not interfere in the U.S. election, and we hope that the U.S. side will not make an issue of China in the election.\u201d\n\nSo far, the newly discovered MAGAflage 1 accounts have had limited influence, with only a handful of followers and minimal interactions.\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies issued their latest assessment earlier this month, warning that Russia, Iran, and China are intensifying efforts to influence the U.S. presidential election.\n\nWhile Russia remains the primary concern, officials noted that Chinese online influence actors have \u201ccontinued small scale efforts on social media to engage U.S. audiences on divisive political issues, including protests about the Israel-Gaza conflict and promote negative stories about both political parties.\u201d",

The move reflects a strategic move by Russian actors aimed at exploiting any perceived vulnerabilities in the new candidates .",
        "text": "Russian election interference efforts focus on the Harris-Walz campaign\nRussia and Iran have both undertaken cyber influence operations headed into the 2024 presidential election. In our last report, published on August 8, we detailed how Iranian cyber-enabled influence operations sought to undermine the Republican campaign through targeted hack-and-leak operations, covert social media personas, and imposter US news sites. In the past two months, Microsoft has observed a notable shift in Russian influence operations tactics reflecting the changing U.S. political environment. Specifically, we have observed Russia pivot towards targeting the Harris-Walz campaign, with actors disseminating fabricated videos designed to sow discord and spread disinformation about the new Democratic nominee Vice President Harris.\n\nWe discuss this activity in a new report by the Microsoft Threat Analysis Center (MTAC) released today. This update follows other reports we have released around activity by actors advancing the geopolitical goals of Iran and China.\n\nThe shift to focusing on the Harris-Walz campaign reflects a strategic move by Russian actors aimed at exploiting any perceived vulnerabilities in the new candidates. Initially, Russian influence operations struggled to evolve their efforts following President Biden\u2019s departure from the 2024 US presidential race. However, in late August and September, we observed two Russian actors MTAC tracks closely \u2014 previously reported as Storm-1516 and Storm-1679 \u2014 using videos designed to discredit Harris and stoke controversy around her campaign. Specifically:\n\nStorm-1516, identified by news reports as a Kremlin-aligned troll farm, produced and disseminated two inauthentic videos, each generating millions of views. One video depicted an attack by alleged Harris supporters on a supposed Trump rally attendee, while another used an on-screen actor to fabricate false claims about Harris\u2019s involvement in a hit-and-run accident. This second video was laundered through a website masquerading as a local San Francisco media outlet \u2014 which was only created days beforehand.\n\nStorm-1679, a newer group reportedly aligned with the Kremlin, pivoted its focus from producing content about the 2024 Paris Olympic Games to publishing false videos discrediting Vice President Harris. One of the videos, which was shared on X shortly after it was published to Telegram, depicted a fake New York City billboard advancing false claims about Harris\u2019 policies. The X post received more than 100,000 views in the four hours after it was published on Telegram.\n\nAs we inch closer to the election, we should expect Russian actors to continue to use cyber proxies and hacktivist groups to amplify their messages through media websites and social channels geared to spread divisive political content, staged videos, and AI-enhanced propaganda. The actions taken by the US government on September 4 mark an important and impactful step to protect against foreign influence targeting the upcoming US presidential election, and Microsoft suspended more than 20 active Microsoft email accounts created by the now sanctioned government-funded communications agency ANO Dialog. However, we have also observed actors attempting to create new infrastructure, with one threat actor already having moved media outlets from seized websites to new ones.\n\nRussia and Iran are not the only nation-states using influence operations to influence the election. A Chinese-linked influence actor Microsoft tracks as Storm-1852 successfully pivoted to short-form video content that criticizes the Biden administration and Harris campaign before some of its assets disappeared from social media following reports of its activity. While most Storm-1852 personas masquerade as conservative US voters voting for Trump, a handful of accounts also create anti-Trump content and use political slogans and hashtags associated with American progressive politics.\n\nCollectively, these three nation states \u2014 Iran, China and Russia \u2014 demonstrate the complexities of foreign interference that the US faces, and the need for the public to remain vigilant against these evolving threats. MTAC will continue to monitor this activity, and provide updates so voters, government institutions, candidates, parties, and others can be aware of influence campaigns and more resilient against foreign interference in democratic processes. As we\u2019ve said before, our goal in releasing these reports is to promote education and protect institutions from any form of foreign interference. Microsoft will not endorse a candidate or political party.\n\nTags: China, election, elections, Iran, MTAC, Russia",

Overall, just over half of U.S. adults (54%) say they at least sometimes get news from social media, up slightly compared with the last few years.\n\nNews consumption on social media\n\nFacebook and YouTube outpace all other social media sites as places where Americans regularly get news. About a third of U.S. adults say they regularly get news on each of these two sites.\n\nSmaller shares of Americans regularly get news on Instagram (20%), TikTok (17%) or X, formerly known as Twitter (12%). And even fewer get news on several other sites, including Reddit (8%), Nextdoor (5%), Snapchat (5%), WhatsApp (5%), LinkedIn (4%), Truth Social (3%) and Rumble (2%).\n\nNews consumption by social media site % of U.S. adults who regularly get news on each social media site Source: Survey of U.S. adults conducted July 15-Aug. 4, 2024. PEW RESEARCH CENTER\n\nSome social media sites \u2013 despite having relatively small overall audiences \u2013 stand out as destinations for news among many of their users. For example, 59% of X users get news there, as do a similar share of users on Truth Social (57%), the site owned by former President Donald Trump. On the other hand, only 14% of LinkedIn users regularly get news on that platform.\n\nAbout half of TikTok users (52%) say they regularly get news on the site, up from 43% in 2023 and just 22% in 2020. The share of users who get news also has risen on several other sites, including YouTube and Instagram.\n\nSocial media sites by portion of users who regularly get news there % of each social media site\u2019s users who regularly get news there Source: Survey of U.S. adults conducted July 15-Aug. 4, 2024. PEW RESEARCH CENTER\n\nWho consumes news on each social media site?\n\nThe people who regularly get news on different social media sites often differ by gender, age, political party and other factors. For example, women make up greater portions of regular news consumers on Nextdoor (64%), TikTok (62%), Facebook (60%), Snapchat (60%) and Instagram (59%), while men make up greater shares on Reddit (68%), X (64%), Rumble (60%), Truth Social (58%) and YouTube (57%).\n\nNews consumers on Snapchat, TikTok, Instagram, X and Reddit tend to be younger than those on other sites. Other patterns are unique to individual sites. For instance, 48% of news consumers on WhatsApp are Hispanic \u2013 much higher than on any other site. And LinkedIn has the largest portion of news consumers with a college degree (55%).\n\nThere also are partisan differences among those who regularly get news on some social media sites. Overwhelming shares of regular news consumers on Truth Social (88%) and Rumble (83%) are Republicans or Republican-leaning independents, as are half of those on Facebook and YouTube. On Instagram, WhatsApp, TikTok, Reddit and Nextdoor, news consumers are more likely to be Democrats or Democratic leaners. X news consumers are about evenly divided by party.\n\n(Read the Appendix for data on the demographic and partisan makeup of U.S. adults who regularly get news from each social media site.)\n\nFacebook, YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, X (Twitter), Reddit\n\nNextdoor, Snapchat, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Truth Social, Rumble\n\nFind out more\n\nThis fact sheet was compiled by Research Assistant Christopher St. Aubin and Research Analyst Jacob Liedke.\n\nRead the methodology and the topline.\n\nPew Research Center is a subsidiary of The Pew Charitable Trusts, its primary funder.

        "text": "From panic buttons to bulletproof glass, U.S. election officials are preparing for threats\nMARIETTA, Ga. (AP) \u2014 The election director in Cobb County, an Atlanta suburb where votes will be fiercely contested in this year\u2019s presidential race, recently organized a five-hour training session. The focus wasn\u2019t solely on the nuts-and-bolts of running this year\u2019s election. Instead, it brought together election staff and law enforcement to strategize on how to keep workers safe and the process of voting and ballot-counting secure.\n\nHaving a local sheriff\u2019s deputy at early voting locations and panic buttons that connect poll managers to a local 911 dispatcher are among the added security steps the office is taking this year.\n\nTate Fall, Cobb County\u2019s election director, said she was motivated to act after hearing one of her poll workers describe being confronted during the state\u2019s presidential primary in March by an agitated voter who the worker noticed was carrying a gun. The situation ended peacefully, but the poll worker was shaken.\n\nWATCH: How Wisconsin tests its voting machines to ensure election accuracy\n\n\u201cThat made it really real for me \u2014 that it\u2019s so easy for something to go sideways in life, period, let alone the environment of Georgia and elections,\u201d Fall said. \u201cI just can\u2019t have someone being harmed on my conscience.\u201d\n\nAcross the country, local election directors are beefing up their security in advance of Election Day on Nov. 5 to keep their workers and polling places safe while also ensuring that ballots and voting procedures won\u2019t be tampered with. Their concern isn\u2019t just theoretical. Election offices and those who run them have been targets of harassment and even death threats since the 2020 presidential election, primarily by people acting on former President Donald Trump\u2019s lies that the election was stolen from him through widespread fraud or rigged voting machines.\n\nThe focus on security comes as threats of political violence have been on the rise. Trump was the target of a potential assassination attempt over the weekend, just nine weeks after another threat on his life. Federal agents last year fatally shot a Trump supporter who threatened to assassinate President Joe Biden, and the husband of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was severely injured in a hammer attack by a man promoting right-wing conspiracy theories.\n\nIn just the last year, a gun was fired at a window of the Cuyahoga County, Ohio, election office, several election offices in five states were sent letters filled with a white powder that in some cases tested positive for the powerful opioid fentanyl, and bogus 911 calls were made to the homes of top state election officials in Georgia, Maine, Michigan and Missouri in a potentially dangerous situation known as swatting.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the things that I have to say is just crazy, outrageous to me \u2014 the election threats to workers of both parties and their families, the bullying, the harassment,\u201d Jen Easterly, director of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency, said during a recent agency-sponsored online event. \u201cThese folks, they are not doing it for pay. They\u2019re not doing it for glory. They\u2019re doing it because they believe it\u2019s the right thing to do to defend our democracy.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Postmaster general claims USPS is prepared for flood of mail-in ballots\n\nHer agency has completed more than 1,000 voluntary physical security assessments for election offices since the start of 2023. Election officials have been using that help to identify gaps and request money from their local governments to make upgrades.\n\nThey also have been aided by a U.S. Election Assistance Commission decision in 2022 that allowed certain federal money to go toward security features such as badge readers, cameras and protective fencing.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s Los Angeles County and Durham County, North Carolina, will have new offices with significant security upgrades for this year\u2019s election. They include bulletproof glass, security cameras and doors that open only with badges. Election workers across the country also will have new procedures for handling mail, including kits of Narcan, the nasal spray used for accidental overdoses.\n\nIn Durham County, a central feature of the new office will be a mail processing room with a separate exhaust system to contain potentially hazardous substances sent in the mail.\n\n\u201cWe have countless reasons why this investment was critical,\u201d said the county\u2019s election director, Derek Bowens, pointing to threats against election officials in Michigan and Arizona and the suspicious letters sent to offices in Oregon, Washington, California and Georgia.\n\nBowens and others who have worked in elections for years said their jobs have changed significantly. Threats and harassment are one reason why some election officials across the country have been leaving. In some places, election workers are being trained in de-escalation techniques and how to respond to an active shooter.\n\nWATCH: Another apparent assassination attempt casts shadow on 2024 campaign\n\n\u201cSecurity to this extent wasn\u2019t on the list before. Now it is,\u201d said Cari-Ann Burgess, the chief election official in Washoe County, Nevada. \u201cWe have drills that we work through, we have emergency plans that we have prepared. We are a lot more cautious now than we ever have been.\u201d\n\nIn Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, about a four-hour drive from where Trump was wounded in an assassination attempt during a campaign rally in July, election officials estimate they now spend about 40% of their time on security and working with local law enforcement and emergency managers on election plans. This involves regular trainings to prepare for anything that might interfere with voting or counting ballots.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very volatile, and Luzerne County reflects what is going on across the country\u201d said County Manager Romilda Crocamo, who oversees the election office staff. \u201cIt seems that people are very emotional, and sometimes that emotion escalates.\u201d\n\nCrocamo is considering purchasing panic buttons for poll managers who will be at some 130 voting locations throughout the county on Election Day. State law in Pennsylvania prohibits law enforcement from being inside polling locations, but Crocamo and her team are speaking with local officials about having emergency responders with their radios at the sites should something happen.\n\nMany local officials said they have increased the law enforcement presence at election offices, including on election night when poll workers are bringing in ballots and other material from voting locations. Added law enforcement also is planned in the weeks after Election Day, during the canvass of the votes and certifying the results.\n\nIn Los Angeles, law enforcement canine teams will be helping scan incoming mail ballots for suspicious substances. It\u2019s part of an updated approach that includes a new $29 million election office that consolidates operations that previously had been spread across the county.\n\nDean Logan, who oversees elections for Los Angeles County, said security remains a top concern. He pointed to social media posts suggesting ways to damage ballot drop boxes and hamper mail voting. He said the letters with white powder were designed to disrupt election operations, and it\u2019s the responsibility of election officials to ensure that doesn\u2019t happen.\n\nThe office will have round-the-clock security and additional staffing from the county sheriff\u2019s department for the November election.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to me that we can tell voters they don\u2019t have to be worried about the security of their ballots,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken steps to keep them safe.\u201d\n\nElection officials say security is a balancing act, ensuring safety while making sure polling places are welcoming spaces for voters and providing enough access to election offices so the public can trust the process.\n\nIn Michigan four years ago, a large crowd of Trump supporters created a tense and chaotic scene when they gathered outside Detroit\u2019s ballot counting operation the day after the election, chanting \u201cStop the count!\u201d as they banged on the windows and demanded access.\n\nDetroit City Clerk Janice Winfrey said her office is much better prepared this time, with more cameras, armed security and bulletproof glass. Observers will now be checked in and screened by security outside a large room used for counting ballots at the city\u2019s convention center.\n\n\u201cMy biggest concern was to protect the staff and the process,\u201d Winfrey said. \u201cAnd in doing so, our building \u2014 it may look the same, but it\u2019s not the same.\u201d",

        "text": "Americans view Walz more positively than Vance, but many aren\u2019t familiar with either VP nominee\nVice presidential nominees Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Ohio Sen. JD Vance. (Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images; Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)\n\nAmericans are relatively divided in their views of Republican Sen. JD Vance of Ohio and Democratic Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, according to a recent Pew Research Center survey of 9,720 adults.\n\nHow we did this Pew Research Center conducted this analysis to understand Americans\u2019 views of the 2024 presidential election and the vice presidential nominees. We surveyed 9,720 adults from Aug. 26 to Sept. 2, 2024. Everyone who took part in this survey is a member of the Center\u2019s American Trends Panel (ATP), a group of people recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses who have agreed to take surveys regularly. This kind of recruitment gives nearly all U.S. adults a chance of selection. Surveys were conducted either online or by telephone with a live interviewer. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other factors. Read more about the ATP\u2019s methodology. Here are the questions used for this analysis, the topline and the survey methodology.\n\nAnd the public\u2019s views of the vice presidential candidates are largely split along lines of support for the two people at the top of each ticket: former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nViews of JD Vance\u2019s qualifications\n\nOverall, 30% of Americans say Vance is qualified to serve as president if it becomes necessary to do so, while a slightly larger share (34%) say he is not qualified. Another 36% are not sure.\n\nAmong registered voters specifically:\n\n62% who back Trump say Vance is qualified; 7% say he is not.\n\n66% who back Harris say Vance is not qualified; 7% say he is.\n\nViews of Tim Walz\u2019s qualifications\n\nAmericans\u2019 evaluations of Walz are somewhat more positive than for Vance: 35% of Americans say Walz is qualified, while 27% say he is not and 37% are not sure.\n\nAmong registered voters specifically:\n\n69% who support Harris say Walz is qualified; 4% say he is not.\n\n59% who back Trump say Walz is not qualified; 8% say he is.\n\nOverall favorability of Vance and Walz\n\nThe public\u2019s broader opinions of Vance and Walz largely parallel views of the two candidates\u2019 qualifications:\n\n34% of Americans view Vance favorably, while 42% view him unfavorably and 23% say they have never heard of him.\n\n39% of Americans see Walz favorably, while 33% view him unfavorably and 28% have never heard of him.\n\nHow demographic groups view Vance and Walz\n\nDemographic differences in views of Vance and Walz largely track with the partisan leanings and vote preferences of various groups.\n\nAge\n\nViews of Walz are more positive than negative among adults under 50, while they are more divided among older Americans. The reverse is true for views of Vance, who is viewed much more positively among older adults than younger adults.\n\nYounger Americans are also more likely than older Americans to say they have never heard of each candidate.\n\nRace and ethnicity\n\nBlack, Hispanic and Asian Americans view Walz more positively than negatively, while White Americans\u2019 views are split (39% favorable, 41% unfavorable).\n\nWhen it comes to Vance, 43% of White adults have a positive view of the Ohio senator, while 41% view him negatively. Black, Hispanic and Asian Americans\u2019 views of Vance are more negative than positive. This is especially the case among Black Americans: Half have an unfavorable opinion of Vance, while only one-in-ten see him favorably.\n\nGender\n\nAbout four-in-ten women (38%) view Walz favorably, while a smaller share (27%) view him unfavorably. Women\u2019s views of Vance are nearly the reverse: 29% have a favorable view of Vance while 40% have an unfavorable view.\n\nMen are about equally likely to hold favorable views of Vance (40%) and Walz (39%).\n\nVance and Walz are generally viewed positively by registered voters who back their respective running mates \u2013 and negatively by those who back the other major party candidate for president.\n\n79% of registered voters who support Harris have a favorable view of Walz and 69% say he\u2019s qualified to step in as president if it becomes necessary. Just 3% have an unfavorable view of Walz and a similar share (4%) view him as not qualified to be president if need be.\n\n75% of voters who support Trump have a favorable view of Vance, and 62% say he\u2019s qualified to serve as president. About one-in-ten Trump supporters (11%) have a negative view of him, and 7% say he is not qualified.\n\nWhile majorities of both candidates\u2019 supporters say the other candidate\u2019s running mate is not qualified to serve as president, Harris supporters are somewhat more likely to say this about Vance (66%) than Trump supporters are to say this about Walz (59%).\n\nNote: Here are the questions used for this analysis, the topline and the survey methodology.",

        "text": "Governor Newsom signs bills to combat deepfake election content\nEarlier today, the Governor announced signing legislation to protect the digital likeness of actors and performers by ensuring that AI is not used to replicate their voice or likeness without their consent.\n\nBuilding on legislation signed by the Governor in 2019 to crack down on deepfakes in elections, the Governor today signed three bills related to election advertisements and communications.\n\nAB 2655 by Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) requires large online platforms to remove or label deceptive and digitally altered or created content related to elections during specified periods, and requires them to provide mechanisms to report such content. It also authorizes candidates, elected officials, elections officials, the Attorney General, and a district attorney or city attorney to seek injunctive relief against a large online platform for noncompliance with the act.\n\n\u201cAI-generated deepfakes pose a clear and present risk to our elections and our democracy. AB 2655 is a first-in-the-nation solution to this growing threat, and I am grateful to Governor Newsom for signing it. Advances in AI over the last few years make it easy to generate hyper-realistic yet completely fake election-related deepfakes, but AB 2655 will ensure that online platforms minimize their impact. The new law is a win for California\u2019s voters, and for our democracy,\u201d said Assemblymember Berman.\n\nAB 2839, an urgency measure by Assemblymember Gail Pellerin (D-Santa Cruz), expands the timeframe in which a committee or other entity is prohibited from knowingly distributing an advertisement or other election material containing deceptive AI-generated or manipulated content. The bill also expands the scope of existing law to prohibit materially deceptive content of elected officials, candidates, elections officials and others, authorizing them to file a civil action to enjoin the distribution of such material.\n\n\u201cSigning AB 2839 into law is a significant step in continuing to protect the integrity of our democratic process. With fewer than 50 days until the general election, there is an urgent need to protect against misleading, digitally-altered content that can interfere with the election. With the enactment of AB 2839, California is taking a stand against the manipulative use of deepfake technology to deceive voters. I\u2019m thankful that Governor Newsom signed this legislation to ensure that voters are equipped with the accurate information they need to make informed decisions this November,\u201d said Assemblymember Pellerin, Chair of the Assembly Elections Committee.\n\nAB 2355 by Assemblymember Wendy Carrillo (D-Los Angeles) requires that electoral advertisements using AI-generated or substantially altered content feature a disclosure that the material has been altered. The bill authorizes the Fair Political Practices Commission to enforce a violation of these disclosure requirements by seeking injunctive relief to compel compliance or pursuing other remedies available to the commission under the Political Reform Act.\n\n\u201cI applaud the Governor for signing AB 2355, my proposal mandating that political advertisements using content created or significantly altered by generative AI, include a clear disclosure of this fact. The availability of tools to doctor images, video, and sound is not new. However, the rapid improvements in AI and Large Language Models have made it easier to create convincingly fake images, videos, and sounds. As these technologies become more accessible and are used in political campaigns, their impact on democracy requires urgent action. Voters must be informed when generative AI is used in political advertising to substantially alter media or create misleading content. Free speech and political expression are a cornerstone of our democracy, but we cannot lose sight of our humanity amid the advancement of artificial intelligence. This is a balanced policy that makes California the first state to include artificial intelligence under its campaign transparency rules,\u201d said Assemblymember Carrillo.\n\nHome to the majority of the world\u2019s leading AI companies, California is working to harness these transformative technologies to help address pressing challenges while studying the risks they present. The state last month partnered with NVIDIA to launch a first-of-its-kind AI collaboration, and earlier hosted an AI summit convening leaders from across technology, labor, government, and academia to discuss how the technology can be used to benefit Californians. Last year, Governor Newsom signed an executive order laying out California\u2019s measured approach focused on shaping the equitable and responsible use of AI while remaining at the forefront of AI innovation.",

        "text": "Down to the wire: The Hindu Editorial on the run-up to the U.S. presidential election\nA second, apparent attempt on the life of former U.S. President and Republican candidate for the White House, Donald Trump, has again lent an air of drama to the unfolding U.S. election campaign. Unlike the first such attempt, in Pennsylvania in mid-July, and in which a shooter\u2019s bullet hit Mr. Trump\u2019s ear, a man with a rifle at the golf club where Mr. Trump was located was confronted by the Secret Service and taken into custody. While the two attempts may win Mr. Trump some sympathy votes on November 5, it remains to be seen whether these incidents impact the public psyche sufficiently to tip the race in his favour. As it stands, the race between Mr. Trump and his Democratic rival, Vice-President Kamala Harris, is poised on a knife\u2019s edge, with the latest national average of polls putting Ms. Harris ahead by three percentage points \u2014 49%. Yet, analysts argue that the difference is not beyond the margin of statistical error, which would make it unwise to assume a winner based on the current trend.\n\nLeaving aside unexpected or shock events that could dramatically shift the terms of the race between now and voting day, the old election adage and past statistical observation that a greater turnout may benefit Democrats will likely hold true in 2024. Indeed, in the 2022 mid-term elections, the performance of Republicans, who were on a strong wicket after incumbent President Joe Biden\u2019s approval rating had fallen to relatively low levels, was dented by Democratic Party supporters who turned out in greater numbers in the wake of the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe vs Wade on the federal right to abortion. Similarly, Democrats may have felt encouraged after the first Trump-Harris presidential debate, wherein Mr. Trump made unfounded allegations about immigrants eating the pets of Americans. Immigration reform has always been a thorny issue that has punctured the campaign of many a previous presidential candidate or the policy plans of elected representatives. Mr. Trump already alienated many voters during his first term and campaign when he implemented his so-called \u201cMuslim ban\u201d \u2014 travel to the U.S. from certain Muslim-majority nations \u2014 and made derogatory remarks about immigrants from Mexico and parts of Latin America. While it is clear that he intends to continue down this path of racist nativism, it remains to be seen whether Ms. Harris will be able to offer a rational and humane border and asylum policy for undocumented workers, including a reasonable and just path to citizenship for those who are productive members of American society. There is a palpable need for bipartisan politics and policy at this juncture.",

        "text": "Why these three states are the most consistent tipping point in American politics\nCNN \u2014\n\nWhether measured by campaign advertising, candidate visits, organizational effort or nervous obsessing over poll results, Michigan, Wisconsin and above all Pennsylvania have moved to the top of the priority list for both Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump \u2013 just as they have in seemingly every recent presidential election.\n\nTrump won the presidency in 2016 by stunning Democrat Hillary Clinton to win all three states by a combined margin of about 80,000 votes. President Joe Biden won back the White House in 2020 by recapturing all three states by a combined margin of around 260,000 votes.\n\nSince Harris took over at the top of Democratic candidate in July, the candidates have spent more money in advertising in Pennsylvania than anywhere else, with Michigan ranking second and Wisconsin fourth, according to data provided to CNN by AdImpact, an advertising tracking service. Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin rank first, second and fourth as well in the amount of advertising the campaigns have reserved through November (with only Georgia intruding as number three on both lists.)\n\nBob Shrum, the long-time Democratic strategist who now serves as the director of the Center for the Political Future at the University of Southern California, said the three Rust Belt battlegrounds have remained pivotal in presidential elections for so long because they encapsulate so many of the entrenched divisions that now define American politics \u2013 between, for instance, urban and rural areas and white-collar and blue-collar voters. \u201cThey reflect the polarization,\u201d Shrum said.\n\nIn a clear statement of their priorities, the campaigns have spent nearly $120 million more on ads in the three big Rust Belt battlegrounds than they have in the four Sunbelt states they are contesting (Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada). After camping out in Pennsylvania for her debate preparation, Harris is appearing in all three of the big Rust Belt battlegrounds again this week. Trump is holding a town hall in Flint, Michigan, on Tuesday.\n\nOther political operatives point out that the historic tendency of these three states to vote the same way in presidential elections functionally makes them the nation\u2019s largest swing state at a time when the other biggest states lean reliably toward one party or the other (California, New York and Illinois toward Democrats; Texas, Florida and Ohio toward Republicans).\n\nMichigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin are not carbon copies. But they do share enough common characteristics that the long-time Democratic strategist Tad Devine argues they should be thought of effectively a single state \u2013 what he calls \u201cMi-Pa-Wi.\u201d Each of them is less racially diverse than the nation overall, according to data from the Census Bureau\u2019s American Community Survey. Whites account for about three-fourths of the population in Michigan and Pennsylvania and roughly four-fifths in Wisconsin. Although their Latino communities are growing, Blacks remain the largest minority group in each of them. The three states are also slightly older than the nation overall, with seniors accounting for about one-fifth of the population in each. None have many immigrants, with residents born abroad accounting for only about 7% of the population in Michigan and Pennsylvania and just 5% in Wisconsin. All three have seen minimal population growth in recent years.\n\nAt a time when education has become an increasingly powerful predictor of political allegiance, the three converge, with about one-third of their adults holding at least a four-year college degree \u2013 just slightly below the share in the nation overall, the Census found. The median income just slightly lags the national average in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and trails by a larger margin (about 10%) in Michigan. All three are big manufacturing states that have seen substantial job loss in that sector since 2000, but have also seen employment in it increase by about 20,000-30,000 jobs since Biden took office, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.\n\nIn their religious orientation, they are very similar too: White Christians, who generally lean Republican, comprise about 55% of adults in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and just over half in Michigan, according to newly released findings from the Public Religion Research Institute. Meanwhile, voters with no religious affiliation, who have become a staunchly Democratic group, represent about one-fourth of the population in all three, PRRI found.\n\nWhile the big three Rust Belt states look similar on all these measures, in some other respects Wisconsin, on paper, should be the most difficult state of the three for Harris this year. Not only is the minority share of the population smaller in Wisconsin than the other two, but Whites without a college degree (the core of the modern GOP coalition, especially in the Trump era) cast about three-fifths of the votes there compared to about half in Michigan and Pennsylvania, according to calculations from Census data by William Frey, a demographer at the non-partisan Brookings Metro think tank.\n\nHeavily White and blue-collar small town and rural areas, which have moved toward the GOP almost everywhere, also constitute a much bigger share of the vote in Wisconsin than in the other two. In a six-category geographic measuring system, devised by the non-partisan Center for Rural Strategies, small metros and non-metros cast nearly 50% of Wisconsin\u2019s votes in both 2016 and 2020, compared to about 30% in Michigan and 20% in Pennsylvania each time, according to results provided to CNN by Tim Marema, the center\u2019s vice president and editor of its Daily Yonder website.\n\nConversely, Democrats don\u2019t have as strong an asset in Wisconsin\u2019s largest metro area as in the other two states. The county centered on Milwaukee is only about half as big as the counties that encompass Philadelphia and Detroit, and doesn\u2019t provide Democrats nearly as large a vote advantage, particularly with turnout there lagging in recent years; simultaneously, while Democrats have steadily gained ground in the suburban so-called WOW counties outside Milwaukee, Republicans still win those three big counties (Waukesha, Ozaukee and Washington), by bigger margins than almost any other major suburbs north of the Mason-Dixon line.\n\nOne last factor makes Wisconsin on paper less attractive to Democrats: unions only represent about half as much of the private sector workforce in Wisconsin as they do in the other two states, according to federal figures.\n\nElection results over the past few decades have frequently reflected the tougher demographic and geographic challenge that Wisconsin presents for Democrats. While Wisconsin provided bigger margins for Barack Obama than Pennsylvania in his two races, Democrats won by more in the Keystone State in 2000, 2004 and 2020. In 2022, Wisconsin was a much tighter squeeze for Democrats than the other two: Democrat Tony Evers won the governor\u2019s race there by a significantly smaller margin than fellow Democrats Gretchen Whitmer in Michigan and Josh Shapiro in Pennsylvania, and Republican Sen. Ron Johnson narrowly held his seat (while the GOP was simultaneously surrendering an open Senate seat in Pennsylvania).\n\nYet this year, strategists in both parties consider Wisconsin the best bet for Harris, and the toughest challenge for Trump, among the big three Rust Belt battlegrounds.\n\nOne reason is the enormous growth in Wisconsin\u2019s second largest city, Madison, which is at once the state capital, the home of its flagship public university, and a burgeoning biotech and finance center. Even as Dane County, which encompasses the city and its suburbs, has added population faster than any other Wisconsin county, it is also becoming more blue: The Democratic share of the vote in Dane County has increased from 70% in the 2016 presidential election to 75% in the 2018 gubernatorial and 2020 presidential elections, to 79% in the 2022 governor\u2019s race, to 82% in the hard-fought 2023 state Supreme Court election that revolved around the issue of abortion rights.\n\nThe other key to Democrats\u2019 success in Wisconsin is that the party has remained competitive in smaller places, a key priority for party chair Ben Wikler. According to the Center for Rural Strategies, a larger share of residents in Wisconsin than in Michigan and Pennsylvania live in mid-sized cities and Democrats run better in such communities than in the other two states. These include places like Eau Claire, Appleton, La Crosse and the \u201cBOW\u201d counties (Brown, Outagamie and Winnebago) centered on Green Bay.\n\nPete Giangreco, a Democratic consultant who has worked in Wisconsin, said the party\u2019s continuing competitiveness in the Green Bay area is symbolic of its broader reach in the state \u2013 and key to its ability to win it. \u201cThe Green Bay market is kind of the bellwether of every [Wisconsin] election, [and] it\u2019s been trending more our way,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s because there has been a lot more college-educated people and people of color moving there. You\u2019ve had a lot of people leave Milwaukee and leave Chicago and go up there. That\u2019s not like Scranton or Wilkes-Barre in Pennsylvania, which used to be Democratic, [but] are really going the other way.\u201d\n\nMichigan recently has been the strongest of these three states for Democrats. Not only have Democrats run better there than in the other two in every presidential election since 2000, but the party now controls all four of the elected statewide constitutional offices (three of which are held by women), both US Senate seats and both chambers of the state legislature. (Democrats are defending an open US Senate seat this year.)\n\nBut this year, operatives in both parties consider Michigan a closer call for Harris than Wisconsin. \u201cMichigan has some weird things going on,\u201d said GOP pollster Gene Ulm, who is working in the state. \u201cThere are some x factors there.\u201d Michigan\u2019s principal \u201cx factor\u201d is anger in its large and previously Democratic-leaning Arab American population over the Biden administration\u2019s support for Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. That unhappiness has spilled over more broadly among young people on college campuses. Michigan Democrats must also contend with a concerted push by Trump to convince auto workers that the Biden administration\u2019s efforts to accelerate the transition to electric vehicles (which Harris supports) will destroy domestic jobs. And while Biden was the candidate, Democrats faced the risk of depressed turnout among Black voters, especially younger men.\n\nBut Democrats have significant offsetting assets in the state. The focus on abortion rights since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade has turbocharged the party\u2019s advance in white-collar suburbs around the state, particularly among women: exit polls in 2022 found that Whitmer won nearly 70% of college-educated White women. As in Wisconsin, Democrats have also retained their competitiveness in Michigan\u2019s many mid-sized cities better than they have in most states; also as in Wisconsin, Michigan Democrats traditionally have run slightly better with working-class Whites than they do in most places. With Harris replacing Biden, organizers are cautiously optimistic as well about reinvigorating turnout among Black voters. \u201cThere was such a lack of enthusiasm over these last few months, a shot in the arm that maybe we have a chance is palpable for folks,\u201d said Branden Snyder, a senior adviser to Detroit Action, a grassroots group that mobilizes working-class and younger voters of color in Michigan. \u201cAnd there are people who are apolitical who are excited about the prospect of a Black woman being the president of the United States.\u201d\n\nThat leaves Pennsylvania as the consensus toughest of the three states for Harris. It\u2019s also the state analysts generally consider the most likely to provide the 270th Electoral College vote for the winner in November. (Wisconsin played that role in both 2016 and 2020.) \u201cTo me, the tipping point is Pennsylvania,\u201d said Giangreco. \u201cIf we win Pennsylvania, [Harris] is going to be president. It\u2019s really, really hard to see where you win Pennsylvania and you lose Michigan or Wisconsin. It\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d\n\nThe same broad trends reshaping the political landscapes in Wisconsin and Michigan are evident in Pennsylvania. As in the other states, Democrats are gaining in white-collar suburbs, especially in the Trump era: Biden in 2020 won the four big suburban counties outside Philadelphia by nearly 300,000 votes \u2013 over 100,000 more than even Clinton did four years earlier.\n\nBut, as in other states, Democrats have been concerned about the risk of depressed turnout and some gains for Trump among Black voters in Philadelphia. And Republicans have built an imposing and enduring advantage among the state\u2019s large population of non-college educated White voters.\n\nExit polls in 2020 showed that Trump won working-class White voters in Pennsylvania by a larger margin than he did in the other two states. The Center for Rural Studies\u2019 typology likewise shows that Trump ran much more strongly in mid-sized and smaller communities in Pennsylvania than he did in the other two states. That may be at least partly because the loss of manufacturing jobs over the past generation has been even more severe in Pennsylvania than in the other two battlegrounds. \u201cPennsylvania has just become a much better state\u201d for Republicans, said Ulm, noting how the Democrats\u2019 lead in Pennsylvania voter registration has shrunk since 2020. \u201cPlaces that used to be Democratic bastions aren\u2019t anymore.\u201d\n\nDante Chinni is founder and director of the American Communities Project, which has developed another well-respected classification system to sort the nation\u2019s political geography. Chinni says that in Pennsylvania (as well as the other two states) many of the places where Trump runs best are what the project calls \u201cMiddle Suburbs\u201d \u2013 middle-income places outside urban centers predominantly filled with White working-class voters, like the blue-collar counties around Pittsburgh.\n\n\u201cThese were union strongholds\u2026and in the past that\u2019s meant they were Democratic,\u201d Chinni said. \u201cBut they\u2019ve shifted. They\u2019ve become Trump-y. Usually he runs up vote in tiny places. But these are Trump\u2019s most reliable concentration of dense votes.\u201d\n\nRepublican pollster Patrick Ruffini said he\u2019s dubious that Harris is as strong in Wisconsin as most public polling now shows. And he believes all of this year\u2019s unusual factors keep Michigan in play for Republicans despite the Democrats\u2019 inherent demographic strengths there. But he agrees Pennsylvania is Trump\u2019s best chance to peel off one of the big three Rust Belt states.\n\nAs an older White Catholic with roots in the state, Ruffini said, Biden benefited in Pennsylvania\u2019s eastern areas from a \u201cregional strength\u201d he displayed throughout the Northeast. \u201cI\u2019m skeptical Harris can recreate this,\u201d Ruffini said. \u201cMoreover, the issue environment might be worse for Harris in Pennsylvania than elsewhere due to the fracking issue and lingering sympathy [for Trump] from the Butler, Pennsylvania, shooting.\u201d\n\nDemocrats, however, see the possibility of Harris amassing huge margins in the Philadelphia suburbs with voters who support abortion rights and reversing some of the turnout decline that Biden suffered among Black voters in the city itself.\n\n\u201cNirvana is getting 2016 numbers in the city of Philadelphia and 2020 numbers in the Philadelphia suburbs,\u201d said Geoff Garin, a long-time Democratic pollster. \u201cIf you do that\u2026your arithmetic in the state starts to be pretty good.\u201d\n\nFor any of these three states to vote differently than the other would depart from recent political history. For Michigan and Pennsylvania to diverge would depart from a much deeper trend.\n\nAll three states were cornerstones of what I labeled in 2009 \u201cthe blue wall\u201d: the 18 states that ultimately voted Democratic in all six presidential elections from 1992 to 2012. The three states moved out of the blue wall together in 2016 when they each went narrowly for Trump and then together moved back into the wall in 2020 when they each broke narrowly for Biden.\n\nIn all, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin have now voted the same way in every presidential election since 1980 except in 1988, when Wisconsin backed Democrat Michael Dukakis and the other two went with Republican George H.W. Bush. The three states have even elected the same party to control their governorships in every election since 1994 \u2013 except in 2014, when a Democrat ousted a Republican in Pennsylvania while GOP incumbents won reelection in the other two.\n\nThe convergence between Michigan and Pennsylvania stretches back much further.\n\nIt probably didn\u2019t seem particularly noteworthy in 1856 when Pennsylvania backed Democrat James Buchanan for the presidency and Michigan supported John C. Fremont, the first nominee of the newly formed Republican Party.\n\nBut Michigan and Pennsylvania would not vote for different presidential candidates again for the next 76 years, when Franklin D. Roosevelt won Michigan and Pennsylvania stuck with incumbent Herbert Hoover in 1932. Eight years later, the two states split again, when Roosevelt comfortably won Pennsylvania and Michigan narrowly went to Republican Wendell Willkie.\n\nBut once again, those New Deal-era splits proved the exception to a remarkable run of convergence. Michigan and Pennsylvania have again voted for the same candidate in every presidential election since 1940 except one: in 1976, Michigan supported its native son, Republican President Gerald Ford, while Democrat Jimmy Carter won Pennsylvania.\n\nAdd it up and Michigan and Pennsylvania have diverged in their preference just four times in the 42 presidential elections since Republicans and Democrats became the principal alternatives in the American political system. The two states even moved together to reject the two parties in 1912 when they were among the mere six states that backed former President Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s third-party bid.\n\nThis trio of states has arguably become the most consistent tipping point in American politics. Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin have voted for the same presidential candidate in 17 of the 26 elections since 1920; the candidate who swept these states won 15 of those 17 campaigns. In the nine elections since 1920 when they split their vote, the candidate who carried two of these three states won seven times. Over the past century, the only presidential candidates who swept these states and lost were Democrats Al Gore in 2000 and John Kerry in 2004; the only candidates who won two of them and lost were Republican Thomas Dewey in 1948 and Democrat Hubert Humphrey in 1968.\n\nThe history of convergence between these three states \u2013 and especially between Michigan and Pennsylvania \u2013 is no guarantee they won\u2019t tilt in different directions in November. As Garin pointed out, \u201cGiven how close the results have been in these states in the last couple of elections \u2026 they could be pretty darn close to one another and still have different outcomes.\u201d\n\nNor is there any guarantee that the candidate who wins more of them will win the White House: Harris faces a real risk she could win both Michigan and Wisconsin and still fall short if Trump wins Pennsylvania, Georgia and North Carolina.\n\nThe one thing that is certain: whatever the outcome in November, the burly battlegrounds of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2013 the political state of \u201cMi-Pa-Wi\u201d\u2013 will be pivotal in it.",

        "text": "IVF as an Election and Policy Issue\nFor the second time this term, a bill that would have established a national right to in vitro fertilization (IVF) has failed to garner sufficient votes in the Senate on a largely party line vote.\n\nIVF became an election issue shortly after a February 2024 ruling of the Alabama Supreme Court categorized embryos created through IVF as \u201cunborn children\u201d under the state\u2019s law. This ruling brought media attention to the potential implications of fetal personhood laws, which are embedded in some state abortion bans and a variety of other public policies, on curtailing access to fertility assistance.\n\nAccording to a recent KFF poll, 57% of voters say they want to hear more about IVF from the candidates. This issue is particularly salient for Democrats (77%) and women in their reproductive years (76%), but also four in ten Republican voters feel it is important for the presidential candidates to talk about IVF.\n\nVice President Harris and former President Trump have both recently expressed their support for IVF care. Trump has stated that his administration would require insurance coverage of IVF services or have the government pay for those who don\u2019t have insurance. There is no mechanism for a President to unilaterally require plans to cover IVF or to allocate funds to provide coverage for those who are uninsured or covered by Medicare or Medicaid. Congress would need to approve a new law to provide IVF coverage, and nearly all Republican senators voted against the right to IVF, and many conservative groups, including the Southern Baptist Convention and Catholic Church, expressly oppose IVF.\n\nWhile IVF services account for approximately 2% of births in the US, they are extremely costly and out of reach for many low and middle income people who need the technology to start or grow their families, a significant gap in health care coverage today. While public support for IVF is high, Congress has been unable to agree even on the right to get IVF services. Agreement on coverage and funding seem even more out of reach.",

        "text": "Historian who predicted 9 of last 10 presidential elections reveals 2024 pick\nAllan Lichtman, historian renowned for accurately predicting 9 out of the 10 most recent presidential elections, has shared his prediction for this year's White House race. Who does Lichtman say will win?\n\nHe forecasts that Vice President Kamala Harris will be the winner. In a video first reported by The New York Times, Lichtman explained that his prediction is based on a set of thirteen \"keys\" or true-false questions assessing the strength and performance of the incumbent party in the White House.\n\nWho is Allan Lichtman?\n\nBefore being named \"Distinguished Professor\" at American University in Washington, D.C., Lichtman earned a Ph.D. in modern American history and quantitative methods from Harvard. He has lectured globally, authored 13 books and hundreds of academic articles, and served as an expert witness in civil and voting rights cases. Lichtman is widely recognized for his political commentary and election forecasting.\n\nWhat are the 13 keys to a successful election campaign?\n\nThe keys include questions such as:\n\nDid the White House party gain House seats during the midterm elections?\n\nIs the sitting president running for reelection?\n\nIs the White House party avoiding a primary contest?\n\nIs there a third-party challenger?\n\nIs the short-term economy strong?\n\nHas long-term economic growth been as good as in the previous two terms?\n\nHas the White House party made major changes to national policy?\n\nIs there sustained social unrest during the term?\n\nIs the White House untainted by scandal, and is the incumbent party charismatic?\n\nIs the challenger uncharismatic?\n\nIs the incumbent charismatic?\n\nHas the White House party experienced a major failure in foreign policy?\n\nHas the White House party achieved foreign policy success?\n\nWhy did Allan Lichtman pick Harris?\n\nAccording to Lichtman, eight of the keys favor Harris, while three favor Trump. Lichtman notes that \"foreign policy is tricky, and these keys could flip.\" He added, \"The Biden administration is deeply invested in the war in Gaza, which is a humanitarian disaster with no end in sight. But even if both foreign policy keys flipped false, there would still be only five negative keys, which would not be enough for Donald Trump to regain the White House.\" As a result, Lichtman predicts Harris will win.\n\nPresidential debate schedule: Will Kamala Harris and Donald Trump debate again?\n\nHarris\u2019 team has agreed to a second debate before the November election, but the details are still uncertain. According to a statement from the Harris-Walz campaign, \u201cThe debate about debates is over. Donald Trump's campaign accepted our proposal for three debates \u2013 two presidential and one vice presidential.\u201d Trump last week posted that there will not be another debate against Harris. In his Truth Social post, Trump wrote, \u201cKamala should focus on what she should have done during the last almost four year period. There will be no third debate!\"\n\nWhen is the vice presidential debate between JD Vance and Tim Walz?\n\nThe vice presidential debate will take place Tuesday, Oct. 1, with GOP nominee JD Vance and Democratic nominee Tim Walz, and will be hosted by CBS News.\n\nWhen is Election Day 2024?\n\nElection Day is Tuesday, Nov. 5. Polling sites in New York will be open from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m.\n\nWhen is the deadline to register to vote in New York?\n\nThe deadline for the general election is Saturday, Oct. 26.

        "text": "There\u2019s a danger that the US supreme court, not voters, picks the next president | David Daley\nIt\u2019s frighteningly easy to imagine. Kamala Harris wins Georgia. The state elections board, under the sway of its new Trump-aligned commissioners, grinds the certification process to a slow halt to investigate unfounded fraud allegations, spurring the state\u2019s Republican legislature to select its own slate of electors.\n\nPerhaps long lines in Philadelphia lead to the state supreme court holding polls open until everyone has a chance to vote. Before anyone knows the results, Republicans appeal to the US supreme court using the \u201cindependent state legislature\u201d (ISL) theory, insisting that the state court overstepped its bounds and the late votes not be counted.\n\nOr maybe an election evening fire at a vote counting center in Milwaukee disrupts balloting. The progressive majority on the state supreme court attempts to establish a new location, but Republicans ask the US supreme court to shut it down.\n\nMaybe that last example was inspired by HBO\u2019s Succession. But in this crazy year, who\u2019s to say it couldn\u2019t happen? The real concern is this: if you think a repeat of Bush v Gore can\u2019t happen this year, think again.\n\nThere are dozens of scenarios where Trump\u2019s endgame not only pushes a contested election into the courts, but ensures that it ends up before one court in particular: a US supreme court packed with a conservative supermajority that includes three lawyers who cut their teeth working on Bush v Gore, one whose wife colluded with Stop the Steal activists to overturn the 2020 results, and another whose spouse flew the insurrectionist flag outside their home.\n\nThat\u2019s why those scenarios should cause such alarm, along with very real actions and litigation over voting rolls already under way in multiple states. Meanwhile, in Georgia, Arizona, Texas and elsewhere, Republican legislators and boards that might otherwise fly under the radar are busy changing election laws, reworking procedures, altering certification protocols, purging voters and laying the groundwork for six weeks of havoc after Americans vote on 5 November but before the electoral college gathers on 17 December.\n\nLower courts may brush aside this mayhem, as they did after the 2020 election. But if the election comes down to just one or two states with a photo finish, a Bush v Gore redux in which the court chooses the winner feels very much in play. The court divided along partisan lines in 2000; its partisan intensity, of course, has greatly intensified in the two decades since.\n\nWhat\u2019s terrifying is that the court has already proved the Republican party\u2019s willing ally. The Roberts court laid much of the groundwork for this chaos in a series of voting rights decisions that reliably advantaged Republicans, empowered Maga caucuses even in swing states, then unleashed and encouraged those lawmakers to pass previously unlawful restrictions based on evidence-free claims of voter fraud.\n\nRight now in Georgia, a renegade state election board \u2013 with Trump\u2019s public gratitude \u2013 has enacted broad new rules that would make it easier for local officials to delay certifying results based on their own opinion that \u201cfraud\u201d occurred. Democrats have filed suit to block these changes; even the Republican governor, Brian Kemp, has sought to rein them in. But if those efforts fail, it could create a cascade of litigation and missed deadlines in perhaps the closest state of all.\n\nThat, in turn, could jeopardize the certification of Georgia\u2019s slate of electors \u2013 and even encourage the Republican state legislature, a hotbed of election denialism in 2020, to select their own.\n\nIf that creates a terrifying echo of Bush v Gore, it should. In his influential 2000 concurrence, then chief justice William Rehnquist noted that Florida\u2019s legislature would have been within its rights to name electors if court challenges threatened the state\u2019s voice from being heard as the electoral college met. (A young Brett Kavanaugh explained the nascent independent state legislature theory to Americans during Bush v Gore; on the bench two decades later he would elevate it in a Moore v Harper concurrence that weaponized it for this post-election season.)\n\nGeorgia\u2019s not-so-subtle chicanery was enabled by the court\u2019s 2013 decision in Shelby county v Holder, which freed state and local entities in Georgia, Arizona and elsewhere from having to seek pre-approval before making electoral changes.\n\nThis was known as preclearance. It was the most crucial enforcement mechanism of the Voting Rights Act and required the states with the worst histories on voter suppression to have any changes to election procedures pre-approved by the Department of Justice or a three-judge panel in Washington DC.\n\nIts evisceration has had far-reaching consequences. Nearly all of them have helped Republicans at the ballot box by allowing Republican legislatures or other bodies to change the rules and place new barriers before minority voters, most of whom vote overwhelmingly Democratic.\n\nIf preclearance remained intact, these changes \u2013 and a wide variety of voter ID schemes, voter purges in Texas, Virginia and elsewhere that confuse non-citizens and naturalized citizens and perhaps intimidate some from voting, as well as new laws about absentee ballots and when and how they are counted \u2013 would have certainly been rejected by the Biden justice department. Much of Trump\u2019s predictable post-election madness could have been brushed aside before it did damage.\n\nThat\u2019s not the case now. Make no mistake: many actions underway at this very moment, with the very real risk of sabotaging the count, slowing the process and kicking everything into the courts, are Shelby\u2019s demon chaos agents, bred for precisely this purpose.\n\nWhether enabling extreme gerrymanders, freeing radicalized lawmakers to change procedures they could not touch without supervision only a few years ago, or transforming Rehnquist\u2019s footnote into the dangerous ISL theory, the conservative legal movement and the court\u2019s own decisions, time and again, have made it easier for a contested election to land on its doorstep.\n\nAnd in that case, 180 million Americans might vote for president this fall, but the six Republicans on the US supreme court will have the final say. It shouldn\u2019t surprise anyone if those robed partisans manufacture the theory to ensure the winner they prefer.",

        "text": "Trump\u2019s second assassination attempt is shocking, but attempts on presidents\u2019 lives are not rare in US history\nFormer President Donald Trump survived his second assassination attempt on Sept. 15, 2024, marking the latest chapter in a long history book. Presidential assassination attempts, whether successful or not, are fairly commonplace in American history.\n\nThere have been 45 men elected president since the country\u2019s founding. And 40% of them have experienced known attempts on their lives. Four presidents \u2013 Abraham Lincoln, James A. Garfield, William McKinley and John F. Kennedy \u2013 have been assassinated.\n\nWhile Trump and Theodore Roosevelt were both former presidents when they were shot, Ronald Reagan was injured while in office, with a would-be assassin almost ending Reagan\u2019s life in 1981.\n\nThirteen others \u2013 Andrew Jackson, William Howard Taft, Herbert Hoover, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Harry Truman, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Joe Biden \u2013 have had known plots or failed attempts to end their lives.\n\nMany were subject to multiple attempts, and it is likely the public was never informed of other attempts upon them or other presidents.\n\nPresidents symbolize the ideals of ourselves as Americans. They often act as the physical embodiment of our country, their political party and its values. When individuals are unhappy with the United States or its policies, some choose to express their opinions in violent ways. Those who choose to assassinate a president inadvertently humanize the very presidents they want to kill.\n\nA common thread\n\nEvery presidential assassination or attempt has been made with a firearm. With the exception of Gerald Ford\u2019s two attempted assassins, all the perpetrators have been male.\n\nThis includes Trump\u2019s two assailants, men who were once enthralled by but seemingly grew disenchanted with aspects of modern politics.\n\nThe Secret Service thwarted an armed man hiding at a Trump golf course in Palm Beach, Florida, on Sept. 15. The Secret Service fired at the person, who fled in a car before he was apprehended and arrested.\n\nThis came just two months after Trump was wounded at a Pennsylvania rally on July 13 by a young man who attempted to kill Trump with a gunshot to the head.\n\nMany presidential assassination attempts seem incoherent to anyone except the perpetrator.\n\nA man named Charles Guiteau killed Garfield in 1881 because he wanted to be awarded a patronage position in government.\n\nJohn Wilkes Booth killed Lincoln as part of a larger plot attempting to create chaos to help reignite the \u201cSouthern cause\u201d and support for slavery. On the same night Lincoln was killed in 1865, his secretary of state, William Seward, was attacked but survived.\n\nAt the same time, the plot was for then-Vice President Andrew Johnson to also be killed by another man, George Atzerodt, who instead got drunk and threw the knife in a gutter.\n\nBooth and his co-conspirators hoped that these politicians\u2019 almost simultaneous deaths would throw the Union into disarray, with an unclear path of succession. Their plan fell apart, and with Johnson alive, the nation\u2019s clear path of presidential succession remained intact.\n\nA near miss\n\nHalf a century later, while former President Theodore Roosevelt was campaigning for a third presidential term in 1912, he was shot in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n\nThough he was shot at almost point-blank range, Roosevelt was, in a way, saved by his poor eyesight and long-winded nature. Roosevelt had a 50-page speech folded in his pocket, as well as his steel eyeglass case. Both items slowed the bullet enough that it just entered his chest but not deeper than the muscle.\n\nRoosevelt famously proceeded to give a 90-minute speech before leaving for the hospital.\n\nOne of the closest comparisons to Trump\u2019s two recent assassination attempts is when two women tried to kill President Gerald Ford in September 1975.\n\nBoth Trump and Ford were the targets of well-publicized assassination attempts within a short period of time, and both were targeted by individuals with logically unclear motives.\n\nLynnette \u201cSqueaky\u201d Fromme, a one-time member of the Manson family, a well-known cult in the 1970s, attempted to kill Ford in order, she claimed, to save California redwood trees.\n\nAt the time, the Environmental Protection Agency was warning people about worsening smog\u2019s effects on the environment, leading her to believe assassination was the only way to preserve the trees. Fromme dressed entirely in red, went to Sacramento where the president was visiting, aimed and fired at him within a 2-foot range.\n\nExcept the gun didn\u2019t fire.\n\nBystanders heard a click, since she had not put a round in the chamber, likely because she did not know much about guns. After that first attempted shot, Secret Service intervened. Later, Fromme claimed she did not want to shoot the president.\n\nSeventeen days later, on Sept. 22 in San Francisco, Sara Jane Moore shot at Ford from about 40 feet away and missed. Her second shot missed as well, this time because a bystander, Oliver Sipple, grabbed the gun, forcing the shot to go wide, injuring a taxi driver.\n\nFinally, Reagan survived an assassination attempt by John Hinckley Jr. on March 30, 1981. Hinckley was obsessed with the popular film \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d and, in particular, the character played by actress Jodie Foster.\n\nHe believed that if he could impress Foster, she would date him. As Reagan left the Washington Hilton hotel, Hinckley fired six shots in two seconds. One shot deflected off the car and into the president\u2019s left side, hitting his lung. One of the funnier lines Reagan would later repeat was born that day, when he looked at doctors prepping for surgery and said, \u201cI just hope you\u2019re Republicans.\u201d One doctor replied, \u201cToday, Mr. President, we\u2019re all Republicans.\u201d\n\nThe best and worst of us\n\nThroughout history, American presidents and occasionally candidates have been targeted by gunmen and other potential attackers to express their unhappiness about the government. The rationales for these assassins\u2019 actions vary from simply chaos to delusions anointing the assassin, or would-be assassin, a heroic main character.\n\nPresidential assassinations reflect the best and the worst of people simultaneously. The violence itself shows the worst of society, but Americans often seem at their best in the aftermath. Like Reagan\u2019s surgeons once recognized, politics should never supplant humanity or be more valued than a person\u2019s health and safety.",

The results are within the poll's margin of error of 4.4 percentage points.\n\nPennsylvania is widely regarded as the most important battleground of the 2024 election, with both nominees' paths to 270 electoral votes severely hampered without carrying it. Pennsylvania's 19 electoral votes are the most among the seven top swing states.\n\nThe poll found a wide gender gap that is benefiting the vice president. Harris leads female voters in Pennsylvania 56%-39%, while Trump tops male voters by a slimmer 53%-41%, according to the poll. Harris edged Trump among Pennsylvania's independent voters 43%-38%.\n\nMore:A fierce debate and seven swing state voters: Readers weigh in on Harris-Trump debate\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nMore:'He said concepts of a plan': Harris mocks Trump in first post-debate rally\n\nHarris also enjoys higher personal popularity among likely Pennsylvania voters, with 49% having a favorable opinion of the vice president, compared with 47% with an unfavorable opinion. Forty-three percent of Pennsylvania's likely voters said they had a favorable opinion of Trump, while 54% had an unfavorable opinion.\n\n\"Besides the fact that she's totally qualified, she's decent and confident \u2013 and democracy is at stake,\" said Tanya Brown, a 55-year-old social worker from Norristown, Pennsylvania, who plans to vote for Harris. \"I don't know if I can stomach another four years of this idiot,\" she said of Trump. \"It's just the uncouthness. You're constantly on edge.\"\n\nHarris ahead in Pennsylvania's Northampton, Erie counties, polls find\n\nThe polls were conducted in the days after the lone debate between Harris and Trump in the 2024 campaign. After Harris put Trump on defense throughout the 90-minute exchange, even many Republicans acknowledged the vice president outperformed Trump in the debate. Trump last week said he will not take part in another debate against Harris.\n\nPresident Joe Biden won Pennsylvania in 2020 over Trump by 1.2 percentage points, while Trump carried the commonwealth by less than 1 percentage point over Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\nAlong with Harris' statewide edge over Trump, she leads in Erie and Northampton counties \u2013 two bellwether counties that have historically predicted who carries the state \u2013 separate USA TODAY/Suffolk University polls of both found.\n\nMore:Kamala Harris needs Latinos to win these swing states. They say she has more to do\n\nHarris leads in Northampton County, which includes the cities of Easton and Bethlehem in East Pennsylvania, 50%-45% over Trump. Biden carried Northampton 50%-49% in the 2020 election. Trump carried Northampton 50%-46% over Clinton in 2016.\n\nIn Northwest Pennsylvania, Harris leads Trump 48%-44% in Erie County, where Biden in 2020 won 50%-49% and Trump in 2016 won 49%-47%.\n\nThree hundred likely voters were surveyed in both county polls, which have margins of error of 5.7 percentage points.\n\nHelping drive Harris' advantage in Northampton \u2013 which boasts a Latino population that is 13% of the county's population \u2013 is the vice president's 60%-25% lead among Latino voters in the county. Yet the common denominator in both counties and Pennsylvania as a whole is Harris' dominance with female voters.\n\nIn Northampton, Harris leads female voters 55%-37% \u2013 an 18-point advantage that is greater than Harris' 17-point statewide lead with female voters. In Erie, Harris leads female voters by an even wider 55%-35% margin. Trump leads among male voters in Northampton 53%-44% and male voters in Erie 52%-42%.\n\n\"This is female-gender advantage on steroids,\" said Dave Paleologos, director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center. \"In all three data sets, the women margin is around almost twice around Trump's edge among men.\"\n\nFew undecided voters left\n\nHarris, who would be the first female U.S. president if elected, has campaigned aggressively on restoring abortion rights following the Supreme Court's 2022 overturning of Roe v. Wade and a constitutional right to an abortion.\n\nIn the statewide poll, abortion rights ranked as the most important issue for 11% of Pennsylvania's likely voters. The top issue for likely voters was inflation/economy at 35%, followed by immigration, at 14%, and \"bringing the nation together,\" at 13%.\n\n\"I support Kamala Harris because I believe she's got her head on straight,\" said Kevin Adcroft, 62 an entrepreneur and real estate investor from Scranton, Pennsylvania. \"Kamala has enough experience and is grounded enough that she would not put the country in danger. And I'm fearful that Trump could potentially do that.\"\n\nMore:Who won the debate? Harris' forceful performance rattles a defensive Trump.\n\nAdcroft, an independent voter who leans Democratic, said abortion rights rank as his top issue. He said Harris seemed to \"sidestep\" a question in the debate about whether the economy is better today than four years ago, but he gave her strong marks overall. He laughed when Harris brought up Trump's campaign rallies and prompted the former president to talk extensively about crowd sizes.\n\n\"That was funny. I thought she did an outstanding job. Even her facial expressions and everything was like, 'Wow.' It was like being with a child,\" Adcroft said.\n\nAbout 5% of the statewide poll respondents said they were still undecided. Less than 1% said they planned to back a third-party candidate. Onetime independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will not appear on the ballot in Pennsylvania after withdrawing from the race last month. Kennedy was not included as an option in the poll.\n\nJack Ross, 74, a part-time pastor from Abington Township, Pennsylvania, was undecided before the debate and is still undecided.\n\nA Republican, Ross didn\u2019t vote for Trump in the two previous elections; he voted for the libertarian candidate instead. He has no intention of voting for Trump now. \u201cHe\u2019s worse than he was in 2020 and 2016 in terms of his just going off, his lack of self-control and some of the statements he has made,\u201d Ross said.\n\nRoss finds Harris\u2019 tax-and-spending proposals \u201cabominable.\" He also worries her shifting position on fracking \u2013 she now opposes a ban on fracking for natural gas \u2013 and other issues are just a case of saying one thing to get elected and doing whatever she wants once she\u2019s in office.\n\n\u201cAm I going to hold my nose and gag as I'm voting for Harris or am I not going to vote for president?\u201d he said. \u201cI'm at that point right now.\u201d\n\nMore:Republican pollster predicts Donald Trump loses the election after Tuesday's debate\n\nMore:'Only losers do that': Democrats celebrate, GOP regroups after Harris, Trump debate\n\nHarris overcoming Republican gains in voter registration in Pennsylvania\n\nHarris' narrow lead in Pennsylvania comes despite Republicans making significant recent headway to reduce Democrats' massive voter registration in Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania today has 354,152 more registered Democrats than registered Republicans, down from a voter registration advantage in 2020 that was 666,202.\n\nIn Pennsylvania's U.S. Senate race \u2013 a contest critical to control of the upper chamber \u2013 incumbent Democratic Sen. Bob Casey leads 47%-43% among likely voters against Republican challenger David McCormick, the statewide USA TODAY poll found.\n\nDaniel Mason, 39, an independent voter from Lansdale, just outside of Philadelphia, was undecided on the presidential race but is leaning toward Trump after the debate.\n\nMason had hoped Harris \u201cwas going to come out and say what the hell she has really been doing over the last couple of years.\u201d\n\nBut \u201cit really seemed like she just kept saying, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re going to do this. We\u2019re going to do this,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you started any of this stuff?\u201d\n\nMore:Donald Trump says he won't debate Kamala Harris again\n\nMason, a chef, said he thinks Trump\u2019s business background could help him turn the economy around. \u201cOur country is failing right there,\u201d he said. \u201cI am struggling myself. I had to pick up another job this year \u2013 the first time I\u2019ve ever had two jobs in my whole life. It sucks, but it\u2019s what I\u2019ve got to do.\u201d\n\nGiven its crucial status, Pennsylvania has become a recurring stop for both nominees on the 2024 campaign trail. Harris held rallies in Johnstown and Wilkes-Barre Pennsylvania on Friday, while Trump held a rally in Johnstown last month. Harris is set to visit Philadelphia on Tuesday for a \"fireside chat\" with the National Association of Black Journalists.\n\nReach Joey Garrison on X, formerly Twitter, @joeygarrison.",
