        "summary": " All states are required to count every absentee ballot that is valid and reaches local election officials by the absentee ballot receipt deadline . You must complete a new Federal Post Card Application (FPCA) to ensure you receive your ballot for the 2024 elections . The FPCA allows you to request absentee ballots for all elections for federal offices .",
        "text": "U.S. Embassy in the Dominican Republic\nYour vote counts! Did you know that many U.S. federal elections for the House of Representatives and Senate have been decided by a margin smaller than the number of ballots cast by absentee voters? All states are required to count every absentee ballot that is valid and reaches local election officials by the absentee ballot receipt deadline.\n\nFollow a few simple steps to make sure that you can vote in the 2024 federal U.S. elections:\n\n1. Request your ballot. Complete a new Federal Post Card Application (FPCA) . You must complete a new FPCA after January 1, 2024, to ensure you receive your ballot for the 2024 elections. Submitting the FPCA allows you to request absentee ballots for all elections for federal offices (President, U.S. Senate, and U.S. House of Representatives) including primaries and special elections during the calendar year in which it is submitted. All local election officials in all U.S. states and territories accept the FPCA.\n\nYou can complete the FPCA online at FVAP.gov . The online voting assistant will ask you questions specific to your state. We encourage you to request your blank ballots be delivered electronically (by email, internet download, or fax, depending on your state). Include your email address on your FPCA to take advantage of the electronic ballot delivery option. Return the FPCA per the instructions on the website. The online voting assistant will tell you if your state allows the FPCA to be returned electronically or if you must submit a paper copy with original ink signature. If you must return a paper version, please follow the same instructions below for returning your ballot.\n\n2. Receive and complete your ballot. States are required to send out ballots 45 days before a regular election for federal office and generally send ballots at least 30 days before primary elections. For most states, you can confirm your registration and ballot delivery online .\n\n3. Return your completed ballot. While some states allow you to return your completed ballot electronically, others do not. If your state requires you to return paper voting forms or ballots to local election officials, you can do so free of charge at the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate. Place your ballot in a postage-paid return envelope or in an envelope bearing sufficient domestic U.S. postage and address them to the relevant local election officials.\n\nYou may drop off your ballot in a sealed, addressed, and postage-paid envelope at the U.S. Embassy front gate during normal working hours. Be sure your name and return address is in the upper left and corner. Normal transit time from Santo Domingo to the United States is slow. You can also return your FPCA or ballot to your local election officials via international mail or professional courier service at your own expense.\n\nResearch candidates and issues. Please see the FVAP links page for resources you can use to research candidates and issues. FVAP regularly sends information about election dates and deadlines through their Voting Alerts. Email vote@fvap.gov to subscribe or follow FVAP on Facebook or Twitter .\n\nLearn more at the Federal Voting Assistance Program\u2019s (FVAP) website, FVAP.gov .\n\nRemember, your vote counts!",

        "text": "As US inflation ticks back up, it could impact the presidential election\nThe fight against inflation is far from over and could reduce the chances of interest rate cuts for this year.\n\nWednesday\u2019s \u201cdisappointing\u201d inflation data in the United States showed a jump from February, dampening expectations of an interest rate cut and raising concerns that inflation could remain stubbornly high.\n\nThe data has implications not just for the US Federal Reserve, which sets interest rates, but also for the candidates in the upcoming presidential election.\n\nThe core consumer price index (CPI), which excludes volatile food and energy costs, increased 0.4 percent in March from the previous month, according to government data released on Wednesday.\n\nThe year-over-year rate was unchanged at 3.8 percent. With food and fuel included, inflation is at 3.5 percent, up from 3.2 percent in February.\n\nWhile inflation is much lower than the 40-year high of 9.1 percent reached in June 2021, when consumers went on a shopping spree with government cheques handed out during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is still well above the US central bank\u2019s target of 2 percent.\n\nThe Fed has been on an interest-rate-hiking spree since March 2022, raising the benchmark overnight interest rate from near zero to the current 5.25 percent to 5.5 percent range, where it has been since July.\n\nWhile that has helped dampen inflation, Wednesday\u2019s data shows the fight is far from over.\n\n\u201cThe 0.4 percent m/m gain in the March core CPI was a disappointment, as it surprised to the upside relative to our and consensus expectations for a 0.3 percent increase. This isn\u2019t going to sit well with the Federal Reserve and may push more policymakers to favour two rate cuts this year, rather than three,\u201d Bernard Yaros, lead US economist at Oxford Economics, told Al Jazeera.\n\nThe latest inflation data as well as last week\u2019s jobs data \u2013 which showed the US economy added some 300,000 jobs last month, well above the expected 200,000 or fewer \u2013 has sparked some chatter that with such a strong economy, there might be no rate cuts at all in 2024, said Matt Colyar, economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics.\n\n\u201cInflation is moderating but happening more slowly than we anticipated,\u201d Colyar told Al Jazeera, adding that the situation is making Fed Chairman Jerome Powell\u2019s \u201cunenviable job that much more unenviable with general elections in November\u201d.\n\nThe last meeting before the elections is in mid-September, and Powell has indicated that the Fed is in no rush to cut rates.\n\n\u201cMonetary policy is an inexact science and takes time to take effect. But it\u2019s a psychological effect \u2013 that first cut, it comes with the message that we\u2019ve won the battle against inflation. It complicates things so close to the elections,\u201d he said.\n\nIf inflation remains higher than deemed satisfactory by the Fed, or if job and wage growth continue at a robust pace, a rate cut is less likely.\n\nBut those are also signs of a \u201cstrong economy\u201d and that typically favours the incumbent, Colyar said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the story of a really sturdy and resilient economy,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018Singular focus on price\u2019\n\nWhile that may be good news on paper, voters still perceive the cost of living as too high.\n\n\u201cWages are rising faster than inflation for a year now,\u201d Yaros said. \u201cYet what people are looking at is prices \u2013 prices are 20 percent above where they were when [Joe] Biden was inaugurated [as president in January 2020], and that focus on price levels is what\u2019s hurting the mood and Biden.\u201d\n\nWhile the latest inflation data shows that people are still consuming at a healthy rate, the average American feels poorer today because prices are higher.\n\n\u201cAnd people look at prices in isolation and not that their wages have also gone up,\u201d Yaros said.\n\nThere is a \u201csingular focus on price\u201d, he said.\n\nThat\u2019s also because \u201cinflation is cumulative and it piles up\u201d, said Dan North, senior economist at Allianz Trade.\n\nFor instance, he said, while wages are around 15 percent higher than where they were in January 2021, food is 21 percent more expensive, housing 31 percent and petrol 41 percent.\n\nOn Tuesday, the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) said its Small Business Optimism Index fell 0.9 points to 88.5 last month, the lowest level since December 2012. It was the 27th straight month the index was below the 50-year average of 98.\n\nOne-quarter of small business owners reported that inflation was their single biggest concern, up two percentage points from February. The percentage of businesses raising their average prices rose seven points.\n\n\u201cPeople still remember that it used to cost $40 for them and their spouse to get dinner at their favourite restaurant and now it\u2019s $62. You don\u2019t remember the pay raises you\u2019ve gotten along the way,\u201d Colyar said.\n\nAll of this is bound to play into the election and be an important deciding factor for which candidate \u2013 Biden or opponent Donald Trump \u2013 gets votes.\n\nYaros noted that people tend to hate high inflation much more than high unemployment.\n\n\u201cInflation affects everyone while unemployment affects only a small section of the society,\u201d he said.",

        "text": "A Quick PR Guide to US Presidential Elections 2024\nIt\u2019s both an exciting and stressful year ahead of us! With all the struggles and brick walls PR specialists need to face during the year of presidential elections, there are a few emerging trends to watch out for in order to have the perfect strategy in place.\n\nFrom thinking about all the ways to manage a crisis (just in case) to researching the best ways to land coverage when journalists are interested in one thing only, it\u2019s important to remember a few things to look out for.\n\nEmerging trends\n\nThe advancement of technology poses a threat to any political campaign with carefully made deepfakes that blur fact and fiction. In addition to the troubling state of local media, social media creators and brands are under pressure to disclose their political leanings. It\u2019s a lot to take on for both PR specialists and their clients.\n\nWatch out for fakes\n\nNew tech has flipped the political scene on its head, and let's talk about deepfakes because, oh boy, they're a game-changer. They've been messing with presidential elections for over ten years now, and they're still causing a stir, crafting stories so slick they make you question what's real and what's not.\n\nAnd here's the kicker: these deepfakes have become so darn convincing that even the media has been duped into spreading fake news stories. But wait, it gets wilder. With AI in the mix now, anyone can whip up fake photos, videos, and even audio clips. There's no need to be a wizard in Photoshop or anything. We're seeing fakes so good, so lifelike, that they could fool just about anybody with barely any effort.\n\nHere are some brief ways on how to spot deepfakes in the wild:\n\nFor video content, see if the audio follows the natural mouth movements at all times. If it\u2019s even slightly disconnected, there\u2019s a chance it might be a deepfake.\n\nTrust your gut. Look for inconsistencies that are simply off, including weird facial expressions, odd emotions, and things that don\u2019t fit with the context.\n\nColoring and environment mismatch happens often, too. If you see anything that\u2019s blurry but the rest of the elements are in focus, double-check if you\u2019re dealing with a fake.\n\nInfluencers and brands are pressured to take a stance\n\nAs the countdown to election day narrows, there's mounting pressure on celebrities, influencers, and brands to declare their political allegiances publicly. It's a delicate balance to maintain, given that any position they take is likely to alienate a portion of their audience.\n\nYou might be inclined to advise your clients to sidestep the online frenzy of \"Who are you voting for?\" Yet, what happens when their fanbase\u2014or the broader online community\u2014starts clamoring for a response? In today's digital age, it's increasingly common for social media users to expect public figures and businesses to disclose their political leanings, regardless of their industry. Whether they're marketing wellness products, children's apparel or swear they\u2019re as neutral as Switzerland, the expectation to pick a side is inevitable.\n\nNavigating this landscape requires a nuanced approach, blending caution with the understanding that, in some cases, silence might speak volumes. Ultimately, whether they're in the spotlight for their lifestyle brand or their social media influence, the decision to engage in political discourse\u2014or not\u2014is a strategic one, fraught with both challenges and opportunities.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to look at it from another perspective\u2013have you considered reviewing the influencers and public figures who support the brand you work with? This is another strategic move to make to prevent a potential crisis, just in case their beliefs don\u2019t align with brand beliefs at all.\n\nThe downfall of TV and local media\n\nIn 2023, local newspapers shut down at the rate of about 2.5 per week, leaving 20% of Americans in a news blackout. While there's a bit of hope with around 550 digital-only news outlets, mostly in urban areas, the number of new digital ventures barely keeps pace with those that close down.\n\nAs the 2024 presidential election draws nearer, there's a push to turn it all around and keep local journalism alive. However, this challenge is quite difficult since over 200 counties are at risk of becoming news deserts, particularly in areas already facing economic hardships and serving diverse communities. Despite the lack of access to local media, an overwhelming 83% of Americans still find their local TV and radio to be reliable sources of news, highlighting a trust in traditional media.\n\nInterested in reading more about public relations trends?

Getting ahead of the game means owning up fast, keeping things transparent, and having a sixth sense for when trouble's brewing. Plus, winning over the crowd? That's all about hitting them in the feels. Quick fixes? Forget about it. It's all about keeping an eye on the pulse and rolling out a plan that hits all the right channels to put out fires.\n\nDuring an election year, there\u2019s much more unpredictability than at other times. PR specialists need to arm themselves with detailed crisis communication plans that take into account all kinds of different situations, making sure that clients or brands maintain a stable and positive public image regardless of political sentiment.\n\nIt's times like these that make media monitoring really shine for what it is. It\u2019s quite unimaginable for any client or brand to risk not knowing what\u2019s going on in the media in the months preceding elections.\n\nThe political arena has shifted over the past decade, evolving from a relatively civil domain into one marked by hostility and polarization. Not to get all theoretical here, but social media, increasing economic disparities, and shifting cultural norms have all greatly contributed to a deepening divide in the beliefs and values of society as a whole.\n\nOpportunities for PR during US presidential elections 2024\n\nThere are several effective public relations strategies you can implement to help your brand or client get more positive recognition in the media, especially if they\u2019re keen on taking a particular political stance.\n\nSocial media is your oyster\n\nWith younger generations being increasingly aware of what\u2019s happening in politics, social media is a powerful tool for any brand or client to connect with their followers. From establishing a stronger presence with subtle (or not-so-subtle) hints of who they will be voting for and what particular issues they\u2019re sentimental about, to inspiring action and influencing others, PR specialists can help draft a plan on how to establish a stronger, positive image in the digital sphere using various social media channels.\n\nFocus on authenticity for a cause\n\nFor the past few years, brands have taken a stance on the causes they\u2019re passionate about. Whether it\u2019s about being sustainable, to fighting climate change, or modern-day socioeconomic issues, it\u2019s smart to use that history of support and highlight it a bit stronger in the months leading up to the presidential election.\n\nJournalists will be on the lookout for politically relevant pitches and will focus on them more than on anything else. What\u2019s important here, is knowing which media outlets and publications have a certain kind of reach, and which political side are they leaning towards. By carefully examining each journalist and personalizing your message, you\u2019ll be able to tailor your strategy better to reach the people you are interested in the most.\n\nConclusion\n\nWith the US Presidential Elections 2024 approaching fast, keeping up to date with advanced technology, social media pressures, and industry trends is crucial to staying on top of your game. Managing these challenges requires skill, an eye for authenticity, and most importantly\u2013a proactive attitude and approach.",

While pharmaceutical spending in the U.S. has long been recognized as higher than in other affluent nations, diabetic medications, including insulin, are now at the forefront of this surge in prescription drug costs.\n\nLeading the surge in prescription drug prices - diabetic medications, including insulin. Photo courtesy: GETTY Images\n\nFrom 2011 to 2020, total annual prescription medication expenditures rose from $341.49 to $473.12 billion per year with metabolic agents being the costliest category. Among the metabolic agents, antidiabetic agents were the most expensive therapeutic area, with an increasing trend observed from $27.15 to $89.17 billion over the same period.\n\n\u201cDespite observed trends in medication expenditures, very little effort has been made to understand how those trends vary by therapeutic class,\u201d reports Tyler Varisco, assistant professor of Pharmaceutical Health Outcomes and Policy and assistant director of the Prescription Drug Misuse Education and Research Center in the journal Research in Social and Administrative Pharmacy. Varisco and Whanhui Chi, a second-year doctoral student in Pharmaceutical Outcomes and Policy, conducted a cross-sectional analysis to identify determinants of increasing medicine expenditures in the U.S. between 2011 and 2020.\n\nTyler Varisco, a ssistant p rofessor of Pharmaceutical Health Outcomes and Policy and a ssistant d irector of the Prescription Drug Misuse Education and Research Center at the University of Houston.\n\nVarisco used prescription medication expenditures from the Medical Expenditures Panel Survey to calculate total annual medication expenditures by payer categories (Out-of-pocket, Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE/Veterans Administration/CHAMPVA (TVAC), Other Government Sources, Private Insurance, and Other Sources).\n\nSpending by Medicare ($38.23 billion) and Medicaid ($8.68 billion) accounted for almost half of all U.S. spending on metabolic agents in 2020.\n\nVarisco also found the growth in prescription drug expenditures in the U.S. can be ascribed to several different factors such as population demographics, changes in technology and healthcare practice. For example, total Medicare enrollment was found to be 48,892,758 in 2011, which later reached 62,840,267 in 2020.\n\n\u201cIn light of these developments, research is needed to substantiate concerns that trends in the cost of care are outpacing patients\u2019 ability to pay,\u201d Varisco said. \u201cContinuing analysis is needed to help policymakers and other key stakeholders understand how changes in practice, policy, and drug marketing converge to impact total market expenditures.\u201d",

Republicans are now trying to convince voters that the ban is not an issue of abortion rights . The ban was passed before the state became a state, before women gained the right to have their own rights .",
        "text": "Arizona\u2019s abortion ban is a political nightmare for Republicans in the 2024 election\nWhen the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade in 2022, Republicans across the country cheered. Freed from Roe\u2019s regulations, GOP lawmakers promptly blanketed the US south and midwest in near-total abortion bans.\n\nBut today, after a string of electoral losses, stories of women being denied abortions and polls that confirm abortion bans remain wildly unpopular, the political calculus has changed. Republicans are now trying to slow down the car whose brakes they cut \u2013 and to convince voters that, if the car crashes, they had nothing to do with it anyway.\n\nNowhere encapsulates the GOP\u2019s backpedal on abortion better than Arizona, whose state supreme court on Tuesday ruled to let an 1864 near-total abortion ban go into effect. That ban, which outlaws abortion in all cases except to save the life of a woman, was passed before Arizona became a state, before the end of the civil war and before women gained the right to vote.\n\nKari Lake, a Republican running to represent Arizona in the US Senate and a diehard ally of Donald Trump, once called that ban \u201ca great law\u201d. But on Tuesday, the inflammatory politician became one of several GOP officials to denounce the ruling, urging the state legislature to \u201ccome up with an immediate commonsense solution that Arizonans can support\u201d. On Wednesday, Trump also indicated that he thought Arizona\u2019s near-total ban \u2013 whose revival was enabled by a US supreme court ruling he has repeatedly taken credit for \u2013 had gone too far. \u201cIt\u2019ll be straightened out and, as you know, it\u2019s all about states\u2019 rights,\u201d he said.\n\nRepublican state lawmakers denounced the decision, but halted an effort by Democrats on Wednesday to repeal the law, instead voting to move to a recess to prevent a vote on the matter.\n\nAbortion remains banned past 15 weeks in Arizona, since the 1864 ban is being held up by legal delays. But Arizona is expected to be a key battleground state in the 2024 elections, and abortion-rights supporters have gathered more than half a million signatures in support of a ballot measure to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution. Democrats are hoping that measure will boost turnout and bring their candidates \u2013 including Joe Biden \u2013 to victory.\n\nIn other words, this ban threatens to become a political nightmare for Republicans come November.\n\nLake and Trump are caught in the quandary that is now facing Republicans in Arizona and beyond its borders. For 50 years, the GOP became increasingly wedded to the anti-abortion movement, passing restrictions that cut off access to the procedure and littering the courts with lawsuits to overturn Roe. These restrictions won them votes from anti-abortion advocates, as well as cash from influential advocacy groups. But because Roe stopped many of these restrictions from taking effect, it shielded Republicans from reckoning with the real-world consequences of anti-abortion policies \u2013 or with the outrage of voters. Since Roe was overturned, and those real-world consequences have come into focus, abortion rights-related ballot measures have succeeded in several Republican strongholds, including Kansas and Kentucky.\n\nLake didn\u2019t say what that \u201ccommonsense solution\u201d might be, but other Republicans have tried to take a stab at it. Juan Ciscomani, who represents Arizona in the US House, called the decision no less than \u201ca disaster\u201d and claimed he was a \u201cstrong supporter of empowering women to make their own healthcare choices\u201d. He also, in the same statement, said the 15-week ban \u201cprotected the rights of women and new life\u201d.\n\nThis seems to be the party line that many Arizona Republicans are now congealing around: they will support a 15-week ban, which the state legislature first passed in 2022, but not a near-total ban. This, too, is a gamble. Last year, when Virginia Republicans tried to take control of the state legislature by proposing to \u201ccompromise\u201d and ban abortion past 15 weeks of pregnancy, they fell short.\n\nYet the post-Roe electoral firepower of abortion has never been tested in a presidential election. Biden has spent months trying to blame abortion bans on Trump, since Trump appointed three of the justices who overturned Roe. Trump, meanwhile, alternates between congratulating himself for overturning Roe, both rebuking and flirting with the idea of a national ban, and claiming, as he did earlier this week, that abortion access should now be left up to the states.\n\nFor Republicans, the only option may be to take a cue from their party\u2019s leader and rewrite their own history. When asked about Lake\u2019s previous support for the 1864 ban, her campaign suggested to the New York Times that Lake was referring to a different law.\n\nBut in the comments praising it, Lake even referred to the 1864 ban by its statute number, 13-3603. \u201cI\u2019m incredibly thrilled that we are going to have a great law that\u2019s already on the books,\u201d she said.",

        "text": "Israel's war in Gaza became a political flashpoint. Will it risk Biden's coalition for reelection?\n\"His policy is at odds with his ... strategy because it's fracturing the party.\"\n\nPresidential election cycles of years past are riddled with examples of major foreign policy issues that shook the international order, dominated headlines and even debates -- but ultimately were not top of mind for American voters.\n\nExperts and analysts wonder if that will change with the 2024 race because of one issue: the Israel-Hamas war, sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7 terror attack, and the ensuing humanitarian crisis in Gaza, which have increasingly loomed over parts of the Democratic base.\n\nInterviews with more than a dozen activists, Democratic operatives and voters revealed uncertainty over whether the six-month-old war in Gaza, already the longest in Israel's history, is significantly shifting political allegiances in the U.S. by turning away voters who would otherwise back President Joe Biden -- or if the detractors are split between voters who will either come home to the president in November or would have found some reason not to support him regardless.\n\n\"Potentially,\" Wa'el Alzayat, the head of Muslim advocacy organization Emgage, said when asked if Gaza is different in its electoral fallout.\n\n\"I think this is a rare occurrence in American politics, but we have clearly seen that this policy is unpopular in the Democratic Party,\" he added.\n\nBiden only narrowly defeated rival Donald Trump in 2020, despite winning the popular vote by nearly 5 points -- and their rematch is expected to be similarly close, likely coming down to thin margins in a handful of states in which any movement among voting groups could be decisive.\n\n\"The president won his ticket by cobbling together a coalition of different groups under the big Democratic tent, as they say, and his policy is at odds with his electoral strategy because it's fracturing the party,\" Alzayat said. \"And it's not just Arabs or Muslims. You're seeing progressives, young voters, Black voters, liberal Jewish voters or progressive Jewish voters. This is a pretty good segment of the party.\"\n\nLeft-leaning groups and anti-war activists have been voicing their fury or frustration with Biden over his ongoing support for Israel's campaign against Hamas, which has come with a high death toll, largely in Gaza.\n\nProtesters have disrupted some of Biden's events and tens of thousands of Democratic primary voters have been encouraged to signal displeasure by backing other ballot options in several states' primaries, including key battlegrounds like Michigan.\n\nBiden has acknowledged those concerns and sought to balance his backing for the fight against Hamas with sympathy for the Palestinians, while criticizing some Israeli operations as excessive. He has also amped up pressure on Israel to allow more humanitarian aid to enter Gaza \u2013 in particular, after the death of seven aid workers with the World Central Kitchen last week in an Israeli strike.\n\nIn the wake of that strike, which Israeli officials called a \"terrible\" mistake, Biden spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for about 30 minutes and \"made clear the need for Israel to announce and implement a series of specific, concrete, and measurable steps to address civilian harm, humanitarian suffering, and the safety of aid workers,\" the White House said.\n\nIn a statement for this story, Biden campaign spokesperson Lauren Hitt reiterated past comments that he \"shares the goal for an end to the violence and a just, lasting peace in the Middle East\" and is \"working tirelessly to that end.\"\n\nBut the persistent backlash has raised the specter among advocates and political experts that the war in Gaza could do what other major foreign policy issues have not in past elections: sway an important number of voters at a time when the U.S. is not itself at war.\n\nPalestinian women and children walk past the ruins of buildings destroyed by earlier Israeli bombardment in Gaza City on April 8, 2024, amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinian Hamas militant group. AFP via Getty Images\n\nSince the end of the Cold War, domestic issues -- chiefly the economy -- have reigned supreme in presidential elections, experts said, with foreign imbroglios rarely notching a spot in polls as a top issue.\n\nMore recent surveys show that's still the case, with exit polling from the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections showing voters more concerned about issues like the economy and COVID-19.\n\nGallup has long tracked what Americans feel is the country's \"most important problem,\" and the economy dominated the public's concerns in the six years after the start of the Great Recession before dropping to a single-digit low in January 2021 -- the height of the pandemic -- and then rising steadily since.\n\nIn the last seven months, from September to March, Gallup polling found that mostly domestic issues led the list of the country's \"most important\" problems: the economy, immigration, leadership, cost of living, and poverty and homelessness.\n\nExperts pointed to one major exception to this trend in recent decades, in 2004, when the Iraq War was fresh and debate raged over whether the fight was worth the sacrifice. Exit polls showed at the time that Iraq was one of the four most important issues to voters, not far behind the economy.\n\nWhy would the Israel-Hamas war make a difference in voter opinion?\n\nIsrael and the U.S. have long been close allies, with numerous social and cultural ties between them, and some Americans have been among the casualties and the hostages thought to be taken by Hamas after the October attack.\n\nActivists pointed also to the lengthy history and existing familiarity, among many Americans, with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to suggest that voters find it more accessible than other international turmoil. That has led to a more visceral response about the involvement of the U.S. in a way the civil war in Yemen or the reported abuses of the Uyghur minority in China, for example -- both of which are large-scale conflicts or controversies -- have not.\n\nEven the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine, which has involved billions in U.S. aid, significant attention from U.S. leaders and an enormous death toll of its own, is not appearing in polling as a top issue in the 2024 election.\n\n\"The horrors of Gaza are exceptionally bad in comparison to any conflict we've seen in recent memories, including Yemen. And it's also the intensity and the carnage in such a short span of time,\" said Alzayat.\n\nDemographics play another role, observers say: There are notable Jewish, Muslim and Arab communities in different parts of the U.S. who have helped drive domestic attention on the conflict.\n\nPolling indicates there has been a shift in recent years in American sympathies for the Israelis or the Palestinians, with the change being more pronounced among Democrats, according to Gallup tracking that showed rising sympathy for the Palestinians going from 19% to 27% in early 2024 while sympathy for the Israelis has dropped in that same period from 64 to 51%.\n\nMore Democrats are sympathetic toward the Palestinians than the Israelis, Gallup found, while more independents and Republicans are sympathetic toward the Israelis.\n\nOperatives suggested the changing reaction to the war in Gaza is influenced in some left-leaning circles by broader conversations in the U.S. about social justice and the treatment of communities of color, which can squeeze complicated dynamics into a simpler \"narrative,\" as one source put it.\n\n\"I think this fits very neatly into the social justice framework of the Palestinians being an oppressed group,\" said a person directly familiar with the Biden team's strategy, who was not authorized to speak to the press and asked not to be quoted by name to be more candid.\n\nOn top of that, extensive social media content about the war -- including photos and videos from inside Gaza -- has brought the conflict between Israel and Hamas to people's phones in a way that other conflicts couldn't.\n\nMore than more than 33,000 people have been killed and about 76,000 others injured in the Palestinian territory, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health.\n\nIn Israel, at least 1,700 people have been killed and 8,700 others injured, according to the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\n\"The other factor I think people underestimate is the role social media plays in how people are getting their information and news now. And you could ask yourself -- would the Iraq War have played out differently if there was TikTok or Instagram back in the early 2000s? And that's the question I ask people, but I think most definitely, we can say yes,\" said Abed Ayoub, the national executive director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, which supports a cease-fire.\n\nPopular opinion about Israel's response has begun to fade: According to a Gallup survey conducted in March, approval among Americans of Israeli military action in Gaza dropped from 50% to 36%.\n\nPresident Joe Biden delivers remarks on student loan debt at Madison College, April 8, 2024, in Madison, Wis. Evan Vucci/AP\n\nTrump, for his part, has suggested Biden's failures as a leader are to blame for crises elsewhere, including in Israel and in Ukraine.\n\nThe source familiar with Biden's campaign said they believe that \"Gaza is different than your typical foreign policy issue\" and could be particularly damaging at a time when Biden is in a tight battle in early polling against Trump and \"has lost ground with young voters.\"\n\n\"The war in Gaza, while not the biggest factor in that, is certainly a contributing factor, I think, in that loss, and, perhaps more importantly, an obstacle to him making the inroads that he needs among those young voters,\" this person said.\n\nVoters said as much when asked by ABC News if the war is an impediment to their support for the president.\n\n'No longer proud'\n\n\"There's nothing that will get me to vote for Joe Biden in November,\" said Heba Mohammad, the former digital organizing director of Biden's 2020 Wisconsin campaign. \"I'm no longer proud to have worked for him to get him elected.\"\n\nOthers, though, were more skeptical that the criticism would make too much of a dent in Biden's support in the general election.\n\nWhere some saw a fracturing in Biden's coalition, other Democratic operatives instead suggested that many of his critics are merely voicing their frustrations while planning to vote for him when it's a binary choice with former President Trump -- and that those who walk away would have done so regardless.\n\n\"What we're seeing is voters saying, 'I'm angry at President Biden on this issue, and I disagree,' but recognizing that Trump is a greater threat to a number of other issues that people care about,\" said Democratic strategist Karen Finney.\n\nA Democratic pollster with presidential campaign experience, and who said they couldn't be quoted by name because of professional concerns, also voiced skepticism about the ultimate amount of anti-war voters who could only be won over to Biden with a cease-fire pledge.\n\n\"He's taken a public pivot,\" this pollster said. \"He's called out Netanyahu, people in his administration have called out Netanyahu.\"\n\nBiden's \"official position is calling for a cease-fire now,\" the pollster said, referring to the White House's stated goal of at least a six-week pause in the fighting to allow for more aid in Gaza and the release of Hamas' hostages. \"How can anyone legitimately in good faith say that they're not voting for him because of this? That's why I don't believe it's a real thing.\"\n\nEven some Biden critics appear ready to pull the lever for the president when the war is judged in the context of a rematch with Trump, instead viewing their vote for ballot alternatives as a wake-up call.\n\n\"The vote for now is really to send a message. I don't really know what's going to happen in November. I'm hoping to support Biden,\" said Rima Mohammad, a Palestinian American living in Ann Arbor, Michigan, where more than 100,000 people picked an \"uncommitted\" delegate over Biden in the state's Democratic primary -- though that number is still dwarfed by Biden's overall number of votes in the primary, across the country.\n\n\"Anything to beat Trump, but we need to get Biden's attention and I think by voting on uninstructed or uncommitted like the other states are he will realize that a lot of his base support is displeased,\" added Sally Morgan, a voter in Milwaukee who likewise said she'll back the president in November.\n\nIn the end, some activists said that while it's difficult to put a true number on how many voters are lost to Biden and how many will come back, Election Day will likely show a mix.\n\n\"I think some people will sit it out, because just the moral revulsion of what's happening abroad,\" said Joseph Geevarghese, the executive director of progressive group Our Revolution. \"That being said, I do think that some segment of the uncommitted vote will obviously say, 'Well, Biden is better than Trump, bigger picture.'\"\n\nYet just as the war is not happening in a vacuum, public opinion on it isn't static, either -- and Democrats warned that as the fighting drags on, the number of voters turning their backs for good could grow.\n\nJames Zogby, a Democratic National Committee member and founder of the Arab American Institute, said he believes \"a lot of people are going to take the position that\" Biden \"has brought all hell down on Gaza. And what's the difference here?\"\n\n\"That will be a mindset that I hear, and that mindset could have been changed,\" Zogby said. \"I would hope that it still can be changed. But I'm losing confidence that it will be.\"\n\nABC News' Mary Kekatos, Molly Nagle and Zohreen Shah contributed to this report.",

        "text": "South Korea\u2019s 2024 General Election: Results and Implications\nMany issues were on display in this election, ranging from traditionally important issues such as rising price levels, the economy, and candidate controversies to newly emerged issues, including the Yoon government\u2019s plan to increase medical school quotas or the nominations of key personnel. The unfavorable results for the ruling party indicate that the rising prices of essential vegetables for family sustenance, coupled with the opposition\u2019s critique of the administration\u2019s perceived shortcomings in welfare, had a significant impact on the electorate\u2019s mindset. This occurred despite the administration\u2019s attempts to stabilize the economy and actions that were popular with the public during the confrontation with doctors who were striking in opposition to the increase in medical school admissions.\n\nQ2: What does the result mean for President Yoon Suk Yeol domestically?\n\nA2: The victory of the main opposition party suggests the continuation of a strained relationship between President Yoon and the legislative body. Since his inauguration, President Yoon\u2019s domestic policies have frequently faced strong opposition from the National Assembly, predominantly controlled by the progressive opposition, which held about 60 percent of the seats. As of January 2024, only 29.2 percent of the bills submitted to the National Assembly have been enacted, significantly less than the 61.4 percent passage rate under the previous government.\n\nPresident Yoon has already outlined key future domestic policies, including plans to increase housing supply, relax greenbelt zone restrictions, and implement major infrastructure projects, as promised through numerous town hall meetings since early 2024. Although these initiatives temporarily boosted his domestic popularity, the election outcome, favoring the opposition, will likely complicate efforts to advance these policies, already criticized as \u201cpopulist\u201d by opponents.\n\nThe DP, now joined by the more progressive RKP, is expected to leverage perceived issues within the Yoon administration surrounding his family and controversial nominations to initiate special probes in the assembly. This could also lead to an increase in political maneuvers by the opposition to weaken his standing, including the impeachment proceedings against key administration figures, showcased through earlier cases involving high-profile ministers.\n\nQ3: How will this election outcome affect South Korea\u2019s foreign policy?\n\nA3: Probably not much. South Korea\u2019s foreign policy is likely to stay on its current course because Yoon\u2019s foreign policy is not based on populism. Since the beginning of his presidency, strong opposition from the DP in the legislative body and a relatively low approval rating have not deterred Yoon from reversing the previous government\u2019s foreign policy. Yoon has followed his campaign pledge to strengthen the U.S.-South Korea alliance and take a strong stance on North Korea\u2019s provocations and has also shown that South Korea and the United States are in tight alignment over their regional strategy. Most notably, Yoon has pushed forward to improve South Korea\u2019s strained relationship with Japan despite the risk of political backlash at home.\n\nExpect the opposition party to turn up the volume on its criticism of Yoon\u2019s foreign policy as impractical. Notably, DP leader Lee Jae-myung has advocated neutrality in issues concerning the Taiwan Strait and Ukraine during the recent election campaign. This stance sharply contrasts with Yoon\u2019s approach, which has sought to enhance South Korea\u2019s global profile through enhanced support for Ukraine, hosting the Summit for Democracy, and promoting value-based diplomacy. With the new National Assembly, this strategic division is likely to deepen.\n\nQ4: What are the implications?\n\nA4: First, President Yoon and his party experienced a pyrrhic victory of sorts. Some may take solace in the fact that despite historical trends going against the incumbent president during a midterm election, Yoon\u2019s low approval ratings, and pre-election prediction suggesting a big loss, the actual number of seats that the PPP lost was only six. Initial exit polls suggested a landslide, sweeping victory for the main opposition DP, with some predictions of a near-supermajority (200 seats) that would have greatly emboldened the opposition during the last three years of Yoon\u2019s term.\n\nSecond, the DP scored a big victory in this election but did not manage to achieve the goal of the desired three-fifths majority (180 seats) or supermajority (200+ seats) that would have given them much more room to operate on measures such as ending a filibuster or advancing bills to the plenary session for unilateral passage without the PPP.\n\nThird, Cho Kuk\u2019s splinter party, the RKP, has gained critical leverage as a result of this election. His party\u2019s 12 seats could now potentially play a pivotal role if the DP aims for legislative actions that require a three-fifths majority (180 seats). However, the future of the party could hinge on the outcome of the South Korean supreme court\u2019s decision regarding allegations against Cho Kuk of falsifying documents for his daughter\u2019s college admission. A guilty verdict, consistent with the previous two rulings, would strip Cho of his legislator status, though he could still lead the party under its approval.\n\nLastly, many of the key partisan players on both sides of the aisle won their races, including Lee Jae-myung (DP leader, Incheon-Gyeyang B district), Ahn Cheol-soo (former presidential candidate, Seongnam Bundang A district), Choo Mi Ae (former justice minister and hardline DP progressive, Gyeonggi Hanam district), Na Kyung-won (former floor leader and hardline PPP conservative, Seoul Dongjak B district) and Lee Jun-seok (former head of the PPP, Gyeonggi Hwasung B district), ensuring or even further cementing political polarization. On a positive note, a number of foreign policy experts and former diplomats won seats on both sides of the aisle, including Wi Sung-lac (former ambassador to Russia), Kim Joon-hyung (former chancellor of the Korea National Diplomatic Academy), Park Jie-won (former director of National Intelligence Service, South Jeolla Haenam\u2013Wando\u2013Jindo district), Kim Gunn (former special representative for Korean Peninsula Peace and Security Affairs), and two former unification ministers, Kwon Young-se (Seoul Yongsan district) and Lee In-young (Seoul Guro A district), ensuring substantive knowledge on foreign affairs in the legislature amid the polarized politics.\n\nVictor Cha is senior vice president for Asia and Korea Chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington, D.C. and professor at Georgetown University.

        "text": "Washington rule could leave Biden off the November ballot, but state has a solution\nWashington rule could leave Biden off the November ballot, but state has a solution\n\nWashington state has just joined Ohio and Alabama in signifying through election officials that President Joe Biden could be left off their general election ballots due to conflicts between the dates of the Democratic National Committee's nominating convention and state ballot deadlines. The Evergreen state, though, appears to have already proposed a way for the Democrat to remain eligible.\n\nOn Thursday, the director of elections at the office of Washington's Secretary of State sent a letter -- obtained by ABC News -- to DNC Chair Jamie Harrison, warning that the deadline for ballot certification under state law falls on Aug. 20, the day after the DNC convenes in Chicago to nominate their presidential and vice presidential selections.\n\nStuart Holmes, the Director of Elections under Democratic Secretary Steve Hobbs, signaled that their office would make an exception for the party if they submit a provisional certification of nomination no later than Aug. 20, according to the letter.\n\nThis comes as Ohio and Alabama's Republican Secretaries of State over the past week have indicated they'd enforce similar state election codes in a way that experts have said is unprecedented and perhaps partisan in nature.\n\nPresident Joe Biden looks on during his visit at the Chavis Community Center in Raleigh, North Carolina, Mar. 26, 2024. Elizabeth Frantz/Reuters\n\nOhio Secretary of State Frank LaRose and Alabama Secretary of State Wes Allen have alerted Democrats about comparable conflicts between their respective state's deadlines and the scheduling of the DNC convention in mid-August, cautioning that Biden's nomination in Chicago comes too late to get on their general election ballots.\n\nIn Ohio, LaRose flagged in a letter last week that the DNC's convention, set to begin on Aug. 19, would miss their Aug. 7 ballot certification deadline. In Alabama, Allen sent a letter to Democrats on Tuesday warning that their Aug. 15 cutoff would occur before the convention.\n\nThis scheduling conflict isn't a new obstacle -- a late August convention has occurred several times in past years for both parties -- but states have historically avoided banning major party candidates from their ballots by either easily granting provisional ballot access, the way Washington is suggesting, or working through their legislatures to allow certification extensions.\n\nBut now, the red-state officials, experts say, are uniquely leveraging the issue against Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic nominees, even as their predecessors made exceptions for former President Donald Trump and former Vice President Mike Pence to appear on their ballots when the when the RNC convention came too late for their certification.\n\n\"This has not been something anybody has ever dealt with. \u2026 [The GOP Secretaries] just cooked it up. No, this has never happened before,\" Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a member of the Democratic National Committee, said.\n\nRichard Winger, a ballot access expert and political analyst, agreed.\n\n\"These deadlines don't exist for partisan reasons. ... But it is kind of partisan this year,\" he told ABC News.\n\n\"You have to go all the way back to 1964 to find a state that kept a major party presidential candidate off the ballot, and that had nothing to do with deadlines. \u2026 There's never ever since been a major party candidate who was off the ballot in any state,\" Winger added.\n\nFrank LaRose, Republican candidate for Senate, speaks during his meet and greet event at Tremont Coffee in Massillon, Ohio on Saturday, Mar. 16, 2024. Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call via Getty Images\n\nDo Democrats have a game plan to get Biden on the ballot?\n\nNow, the Biden campaign, along with Democratic officials, are looking into ways to ensure the president will appear on the ballot in front of Ohio and Alabama voters.\n\nIn response to the news from Ohio and Alabama, Biden's reelection campaign has maintained that \"Joe Biden will be on the ballot in all 50 states.\" They see this happening first by provisional certification (the process of formally notifying states before the convention that they expect Biden to be the nominee); second by changing the state's election filing deadlines through the state's GOP-controlled legislatures; third through litigation in court; and finally, by virtually nominating the Biden-Harris ticket ahead of their in-person convention.\n\nHistorically, in both Ohio and Alabama -- and across a handful of other states -- provisional ballot access certification has been granted to nominees of both major parties if they weren't able to square their convention dates with state election code certification deadlines.\n\nAhead of the 2020 general election, Oklahoma, Illinois, Washington and Montana accepted provisional certifications from the DNC and the Republican National Committee. Alabama also accepted a provisional certification from Republicans that year in order to make Trump and Pence qualify.\n\nIn 2020, the Alabama legislature moved their certification deadline for that election only to Aug. 20, 2020, but that was still ahead of the Republican convention's end a week later. The RNC then submitted a provisional certification, which was accepted by the state.\n\nIn Ohio, the Biden campaign has said they are in conversation with the Secretary's office about steps forward in terms of provisional certification.\n\nIn a letter received by the Ohio Secretary of State and reviewed by ABC News this week, Democratic Ohio-based lawyer Donald McTigue said the Democratic party would provisionally certify Biden and Harris by the state's Aug. 7 deadline and later confirm the results at the convention.\n\nBen Kindel, a spokesperson for LaRose's office, said their legal counsel was in the process of reviewing the letter.\n\nIn Alabama, attorney Barry Ragsdale, representing the Biden campaign, sent a letter -- obtained by ABC News -- to general counsel for the Alabama Secretary of State's office on Wednesday, saying the DNC could provisionally certify Biden and Harris as party nominees by the state's Aug. 15 deadline and then later confirm the results at the convention.\n\n\"This proposal avoids the constitutional problems that would arise if your office were to interpret Ala. Code \u00a7 17-14-31(b)'s certification deadline to preclude President Biden and Vice President Harris from appearing on the Alabama general election ballot,\" Ragsdale wrote.\n\n\"It would allow the many Alabamians who support President Biden and Vice President Harris to exercise their fundamental constitutional right to meaningfully participate in the presidential election,\" he added.\n\nIn response to the letter, Allen said in a statement to ABC News that he would not provide \"for 'provisional certifications' or any other exceptions.\"\n\nDemocratic presidential nominee Joe Biden speaks during the Democratic National Convention at the Chase Center in Wilmington, Delaware, Aug. 20, 2020. Stefani Reynolds/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nIf provisional ballot certification cannot be achieved, the Biden official said their strategy would shift to the state legislatures. This legislative action has worked not only in Alabama but also in Ohio, where laws were passed ahead of both the 2012 and 2020 elections to skirt around the state's 90-day deadline for nomination ahead of an election. These laws aided both Republicans and Democrats in getting their candidates on the ballot, most recently in 2020, when Democrats and Republicans both held conventions ahead of the deadline.\n\nIn their initial letter to Democrats, legal counsel for Secretary LaRose gave two options: either move up the date of the DNC convention or by May 9, the state's GOP-led legislature would need to pass a law allowing for an extension.\n\nIn the days following Alabama's warning to Biden, Democratic state senator Merika Coleman introduced a bill that would move the state's deadline back to Aug. 23, after the DNC Convention.\n\nOne of the final courses of action would be through litigation in court, which the Biden campaign claims they have a \"strong case\" for.\n\nIn their letter to Alabama leadership, Biden's counsel wrote that \"a court would have little difficulty finding that strict application of the eighty-two- day deadline imposes a severe restriction on President Biden and Vice President Harris's access to the ballot,\" arguing that the state's actions in barring the presumptive nominees were \"unjust and unconstitutional.\"\n\nCourts might even cite the recent Supreme Court decision on Trump v. Anderson, the challenge that sought to bar Trump from Colorado's GOP primary ballot, as the high court's justices ruled that states have no power to bar candidates for federal offices \u2013 especially the Presidency -- from appearing on the ballot.\n\nThe final step would be for the DNC to hold a virtual vote to nominate the Biden-Harris ticket before their August convention.\n\n\"If for some reason they don't do the provisional certification, there's the legislature. If, for some reason, the legislature doesn't play ball and we have litigation, the case for litigation is really strong. But if for some reason we are unsuccessful, then we have this procedure on this that the DNC can use and like completely nullify the issue,\" a Biden campaign official said to ABC News.\n\n\"So bottom line is we're gonna be on the ballot in both these states,\" they added.\n\nABC News has requested comment from Washington's Secretary of State.\n\n-- ABC News' Kendall Ross contributed to this report.",

Joe Manchin is retiring and he\u2019s seen as the only Democrat who can win his now deeply Republican state.\n\nThat leaves Arizona, Montana, Nevada and Ohio \u2013 the four races Taylor has rated as toss-ups, or the most competitive.\n\n\u201cDemocrats have to defend every incumbent that they have, but even doing that might not be enough,\u201d she said.\n\nThat\u2019s because even if Democrats prevail in the four toss-up races, that would leave a 50-50 Senate.\n\nIf former President Donald Trump wins in November, his vice president would cast the tie breaking vote in the Senate, giving Republicans control.\n\nThis month, Taylor changed her rating for Nevada\u2019s Senate race from lean democratic to toss-up.\n\nIncumbent Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen will likely face Republican veteran Sam Brown. Taylor said Nevada\u2019s slow economic recovery from COVID, its status as a presidential battleground, and its transient population producing new voters each cycle will make it more competitive for Democrats than races in other key states.\n\n\u201cSo when I looked at that against some of the other swing states, like Michigan or Wisconsin or Pennsylvania, Nevada was actually in worse shape,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nShe also considers Montana and Ohio to be toss-ups. Longtime incumbent Democrats Jon Tester and Sherrod Brown are each running for a fourth term in states Trump has won twice.\n\nIn Montana, Tester is likely to face former Navy SEAL Tim Sheehy. In Ohio, Brown is being challenged by businessman Bernie Moreno.\n\n\u201cThey were both elected in 2006, when Democrats won back the Senate,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cThey were reelected in 2012, when Obama was reelected in a very strong year. And then they won in 2018, another very strong Democratic year [amid] the backlash to Trump's first midterm election. So they're running in a very different environment though.\u201d\n\nThe fourth toss-up is in Arizona, another presidential battleground. Democrat Ruben Gallego, a current U.S. House member, is expected to take on Republican Kari Lake, a former TV news anchor who unsuccessfully ran for governor in 2022. They are running to replace Independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, who is leaving office.\n\nOne potential wild card is the race for president. Taylor said in presidential election years, key Senate races often align with the race for the White House.\n\n\u201cIn 2016, every single Senate race went the same way as the presidential race did in their state,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd in 2020, only Susan Collins in Maine managed to win reelection even as Biden carried that state. So it's a difficult task to convince voters to vote for one party for president and go a different way for Senate.\u201d\n\nThis cycle, Taylor said national Republicans have been more involved in competitive primaries because they struggled with flawed candidates in 2022.\n\nShe said Democrats in competitive races, meanwhile, are distancing themselves from Biden to seem more independent.\n\nThe election is still more than six months away, so this Senate forecast could easily change, but for now, Democrats are on defense and Republicans are on offense.",

        "text": "Biden-Harris Administration Finalizes First-Ever National Drinking Water Standard to Protect 100M People from PFAS Pollution\nBiden-Harris Administration Finalizes First-Ever National Drinking Water Standard to Protect 100M People from PFAS Pollution\n\nAs part of the Administration\u2019s commitment to combating PFAS pollution, EPA announces $1B investment through President Biden\u2019s Investing in America agenda to address PFAS in drinking water\n\nApril 10, 2024\n\nContact Information EPA Press Office ( press@epa.gov\n\nWASHINGTON - Today, April 10, the Biden-Harris Administration issued the first-ever national, legally enforceable drinking water standard to protect communities from exposure to harmful per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), also known as \u2018forever chemicals.\u2019 Exposure to PFAS has been linked to deadly cancers, impacts to the liver and heart, and immune and developmental damage to infants and children. This final rule represents the most significant step to protect public health under EPA\u2019s PFAS Strategic Roadmap. The final rule will reduce PFAS exposure for approximately 100 million people, prevent thousands of deaths, and reduce tens of thousands of serious illnesses. Today\u2019s announcement complements President Biden\u2019s government-wide action plan to combat PFAS pollution.\n\nThrough President Biden\u2019s Investing in America agenda, EPA is also making unprecedented funding available to help ensure that all people have clean and safe water. In addition to today\u2019s final rule, EPA is announcing nearly $1 billion in newly available funding through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to help states and territories implement PFAS testing and treatment at public water systems and to help owners of private wells address PFAS contamination. This is part of a $9 billion investment through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to help communities with drinking water impacted by PFAS and other emerging contaminants \u2013 the largest-ever investment in tackling PFAS pollution. An additional $12 billion is available through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for general drinking water improvements, including addressing emerging contaminants like PFAS.\n\nEPA Administrator Michael Regan will join White House Council on Environmental Quality Chair Brenda Mallory to announce the final standard today at an event in Fayetteville, North Carolina. In 2017, area residents learned that the Cape Fear River, the drinking water source for 1 million people in the region, had been heavily contaminated with PFAS pollution from a nearby manufacturing facility. Today\u2019s announcements will help protect communities like Fayetteville from further devastating impacts of PFAS.\n\n\u201cDrinking water contaminated with PFAS has plagued communities across this country for too long,\u201d said EPA Administrator Michael S. Regan. \u201cThat is why President Biden has made tackling PFAS a top priority, investing historic resources to address these harmful chemicals and protect communities nationwide. Our PFAS Strategic Roadmap marshals the full breadth of EPA\u2019s authority and resources to protect people from these harmful forever chemicals. Today, I am proud to finalize this critical piece of our Roadmap, and in doing so, save thousands of lives and help ensure our children grow up healthier.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Biden believes that everyone deserves access to clean, safe drinking water, and he is delivering on that promise,\u201d said Brenda Mallory, Chair of the White House Council on Environmental Quality. \u201cThe first national drinking water standards for PFAS marks a significant step towards delivering on the Biden-Harris Administration\u2019s commitment to advancing environmental justice, protecting communities, and securing clean water for people across the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnder President Biden\u2019s leadership, we are taking a whole-of-government approach to tackle PFAS pollution and ensure that all Americans have access to clean, safe drinking water. Today\u2019s announcement by EPA complements these efforts and will help keep our communities safe from these toxic \u2018forever chemicals,\u2019\u201d said Deputy Assistant to the President for the Cancer Moonshot, Dr. Danielle Carnival. \u201cCoupled with the additional $1 billion investment from President Biden\u2019s Investing in America agenda to help communities address PFAS pollution, the reductions in exposure to toxic substances delivered by EPA\u2019s standards will further the Biden Cancer Moonshot goal of reducing the cancer death rate by at least half by 2047 and preventing more than four million cancer deaths \u2014 and stopping cancer before it starts by protecting communities from known risks associated with exposure to PFAS and other contaminants, including kidney and testicular cancers, and more.\u201d\n\nEPA is taking a signature step to protect public health by establishing legally enforceable levels for several PFAS known to occur individually and as mixtures in drinking water. This rule sets limits for five individual PFAS: PFOA, PFOS, PFNA, PFHxS, and HFPO-DA (also known as \u201cGenX Chemicals\u201d). The rule also sets a limit for mixtures of any two or more of four PFAS: PFNA, PFHxS, PFBS, and \u201cGenX chemicals.\u201d By reducing exposure to PFAS, this final rule will prevent thousands of premature deaths, tens of thousands of serious illnesses, including certain cancers and liver and heart impacts in adults, and immune and developmental impacts to infants and children.\n\nThis final rule advances President Biden\u2019s commitment to ending cancer as we know it as part of the Biden Cancer Moonshot, to ensuring that all Americans have access to clean, safe, drinking water, and to furthering the Biden-Harris Administration\u2019s commitment to environmental justice by protecting communities that are most exposed to toxic chemicals.\n\nEPA estimates that between about 6% and 10% of the 66,000 public drinking water systems subject to this rule may have to take action to reduce PFAS to meet these new standards. All public water systems have three years to complete their initial monitoring for these chemicals. They must inform the public of the level of PFAS measured in their drinking water. Where PFAS is found at levels that exceed these standards, systems must implement solutions to reduce PFAS in their drinking water within five years.\n\nThe new limits in this rule are achievable using a range of available technologies and approaches including granular activated carbon, reverse osmosis, and ion exchange systems. For example, the Cape Fear Public Utility Authority, serving Wilmington, NC \u2013 one of the communities most heavily impacted by PFAS contamination \u2013 has effectively deployed a granular activated carbon system to remove PFAS regulated by this rule. Drinking water systems will have flexibility to determine the best solution for their community.\n\nEPA will be working closely with state co-regulators in supporting water systems and local officials to implement this rule. In the coming weeks, EPA will host a series of webinars to provide information to the public, communities, and water utilities about the final PFAS drinking water regulation. To learn more about the webinars, please visit EPA\u2019s PFAS drinking water regulation webpage. EPA has also published a toolkit of communications resources to help drinking water systems and community leaders educate the public about PFAS, where they come from, their health risks, how to reduce exposure, and about this rule.\n\n\u201cWe are thankful that Administrator Regan and the Biden Administration are taking this action to protect drinking water in North Carolina and across the country,\u201d said North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper. \u201cWe asked for this because we know science-based standards for PFAS and other compounds are desperately needed.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor decades, the American people have been exposed to the family of incredibly toxic \u2018forever chemicals\u2019 known as PFAS with no protection from their government. Those chemicals now contaminate virtually all Americans from birth. That\u2019s because for generations, PFAS chemicals slid off of every federal environmental law like a fried egg off a Teflon pan \u2014 until Joe Biden came along,\u201d said Environmental Working Group President and Co-Founder Ken Cook. \u201cWe commend EPA Administrator Michael Regan for his tireless leadership to make this decision a reality, and CEQ Chair Brenda Mallory for making sure PFAS is tackled with the \u2018whole of government\u2019 approach President Biden promised. There is much work yet to be done to end PFAS pollution. The fact that the EPA has adopted the very strong policy announced today should give everyone confidence that the Biden administration will stay the course and keep the president\u2019s promises, until the American people are protected, at long last, from the scourge of PFAS pollution.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe learned about GenX and other PFAS in our tap water six years ago. I raised my children on this water and watched loved ones suffer from rare or recurrent cancers. No one should ever worry if their tap water will make them sick or give them cancer. I\u2019m grateful the Biden EPA heard our pleas and kept its promise to the American people. We will keep fighting until all exposures to PFAS end and the chemical companies responsible for business-related human rights abuses are held fully accountable,\u201d said Emily Donovan, co-founder of Clean Cape Fear.\n\nMore details about funding to address PFAS in Drinking Water\n\nThrough the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, EPA is making an unprecedented $21 billion available to strengthen our nation\u2019s drinking water systems, including by addressing PFAS contamination. Of that, $9 billion is specifically for tackling PFAS and emerging contaminants. The financing programs delivering this funding are part of President Biden\u2019s Justice40 Initiative, which set the goal that 40% of the overall benefits of certain federal investments flow to disadvantaged communities that have been historically marginalized by underinvestment and overburdened by pollution.\n\nAdditionally, EPA has a nationwide Water Technical Assistance program to help small, rural, and disadvantaged communities access federal resources by working directly with water systems to identify challenges like PFAS; develop plans; build technical, managerial, and financial capacity; and apply for water infrastructure funding. Learn more about EPA\u2019s Water Technical Assistance programs.\n\nMore details about the final PFAS drinking water standards:\n\nFor PFOA and PFOS, EPA is setting a Maximum Contaminant Level Goal, a non-enforceable health-based goal, at zero. This reflects the latest science showing that there is no level of exposure to these contaminants without risk of health impacts, including certain cancers.\n\nEPA is setting enforceable Maximum Contaminant Levels at 4.0 parts per trillion for PFOA and PFOS, individually. This standard will reduce exposure from these PFAS in our drinking water to the lowest levels that are feasible for effective implementation.\n\nFor PFNA, PFHxS, and \u201cGenX Chemicals,\u201d EPA is setting the MCLGs and MCLs at 10 parts per trillion.\n\nBecause PFAS can often be found together in mixtures, and research shows these mixtures may have combined health impacts, EPA is also setting a limit for any mixture of two or more of the following PFAS: PFNA, PFHxS, PFBS, and \u201cGenX Chemicals.\u201d\n\nEPA is issuing this rule after reviewing extensive research and science on how PFAS affects public health, while engaging with the water sector and with state regulators to ensure effective implementation. EPA also considered 120,000 comments on the proposed rule from a wide variety of stakeholders.\n\nBackground:\n\nPFAS, also known as \u2018forever chemicals,\u2019 are prevalent in the environment. PFAS are a category of chemicals used since the 1940s to repel oil and water and resist heat, which makes them useful in everyday products such as nonstick cookware, stain resistant clothing, and firefighting foam. The science is clear that exposure to certain PFAS over a long period of time can cause cancer and other illnesses. In addition, PFAS exposure during critical life stages such as pregnancy or early childhood can also result in adverse health impacts.\n\nAcross the country, PFAS contamination is impacting millions of people\u2019s health and wellbeing. People can be exposed to PFAS through drinking water or food contaminated with PFAS, by coming into contact with products that contain PFAS, or through workplace exposures in certain industries.\n\nSince EPA Administrator Michael S. Regan announced the PFAS Strategic Roadmap in October 2021, EPA has taken action \u2013 within the Biden-Harris Administration\u2019s whole-of-government approach \u2013 by advancing science and following the law to safeguard public health, protect the environment, and hold polluters accountable. The actions described in the PFAS Strategic Roadmap each represent important and meaningful steps to protect communities from PFAS contamination. Cumulatively, these actions will build upon one another and lead to more enduring and protective solutions. In December 2023, the EPA released its second annual report on PFAS progress. The report highlights significant accomplishments achieved under the EPA\u2019s PFAS Strategic Roadmap.",

        "text": "U.S. Capitol Police chief describes preparations for possible post-election turmoil \u2022 Nebraska Examiner\nWASHINGTON \u2014 U.S. Capitol Police Chief J. Thomas Manger sought to ease concerns from the lawmakers in charge of his agency\u2019s budget on Wednesday, saying the department is preparing for major upcoming events \u2014 including another potential Jan. 6 \u2014 by trying to grow the size of its force and overhauling its intelligence gathering activities.\n\nDuring an hour-long hearing in front of the House Appropriations Legislative Branch Subcommittee, Manger argued the agency is far better positioned than in the past to address the safety of members both in the Capitol complex and at their residences, though at one point he said USCP\u2019s \u201cresources are strained.\u201d\n\nManger also noted USCP has fallen behind and is trying to enhance protection for House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, and Senate Speaker pro tempore Patty Murray, a Washington state Democrat, since they are second and third in the line of presidential succession, respectively.\n\nThe U.S. Secretary of State, who sits fourth in the line of succession below both those lawmakers, has a security detail three times larger than anything USCP provides, Manger told the committee.\n\n\u201cWe know we\u2019ve got to expand the protection for the individuals that are in the line of succession,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t just go back to the days when we said, \u2018Well, we\u2019ll just follow them around and we\u2019ll make sure they\u2019re well protected wherever they are,\u2019 because their homes, their families are at risk.\u201d\n\nImprovements since insurrection\n\nSeveral members of the panel pressed Manger about how exactly the agency has updated its thinking, staffing and tactics since the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol building by pro-Trump rioters. Dozens of police officers were injured in that attack and two law enforcement officers died as a result of that day.\n\nThe insurrection disrupted Congress certifying the Electoral College votes to affirm President Joe Biden\u2019s win in the election. That was the first time the United States didn\u2019t have a peaceful transition of power.\n\nVotes must be certified again by Congress on Jan. 6, 2025, following this November\u2019s presidential election.\n\nIllinois Democratic Rep. Mike Quigley asked Manger during the hearing about USCP\u2019s response plan for a threat that would require additional police officers to come in quickly.\n\nManger said the department has already started preparing for the \u201celection, the next January 6, the inauguration.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe already have committed hundreds of police officers from allied organizations. And by the time we get to those dates, we could have thousands of trained law enforcement officers\u2026 So the cavalry will be here on site for all the big events.\u201d\n\nManger said USCP is able to maintain relationships with other law enforcement agencies, in part, because those other agencies are reimbursed for helping.\n\nIn addition to keeping that funding stream available, USCP needs the spending panel to preserve retention bonuses to try to reduce attrition.\n\n\u201cWe need for people to stay for the conventions, for the election, for the next January 6, for the inauguration and beyond,\u201d Manger said, implying retention bonuses will help to do that.\n\nAnticipating a threat\n\nOne of the largest criticisms of USCP following the Jan. 6 attack was that its intelligence operation failed to realize the extent of the threat to the Capitol and the lawmakers inside, an issue that Manger said has been addressed in the last three years.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s night and day,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe have U.S. Capitol Police employees that are sitting in joint operation centers, that are sitting in other agencies, so that we immediately get that information,\u201d he testified. \u201cBut we\u2019re also doing two things that weren\u2019t being done very well before, in my view.\u201d\n\nUSCP is now analyzing intelligence to see what threats are credible and sharing those with its own officers on a daily basis.\n\nThe department also has a new working relationship with the National Guard, including Manger\u2019s ability to call up troops without needing to wait on anyone else\u2019s approval, though he seemed wary of doing that during a crisis.\n\n\u201cI will tell you that the National Guard is terrific,\u201d Manger said. \u201cBut what I really need is trained, equipped law enforcement officers, who are trained in crowd control, civil disturbance. And, again, if we need it, we will have thousands of those on our campus.\u201d\n\nOutside of responding to possibly large-scale attacks on Congress, USCP should expand its presence at airports in the Washington, D.C. area, according to the panel\u2019s ranking member Adriano Espaillat, a New York Democrat.\n\nLawmakers traveling through airports, Espaillat said, \u201care subject to threats.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think there needs to be a greater presence in the airport,\u201d he said.\n\nManger said USCP tries to \u201caccommodate\u201d all lawmakers who request police escorts through airports and noted it has people at the three main airports in the Washington, D.C., region.\n\nPolice budget\n\nThe fiscal 2025 budget request for Capitol Police proposes that Congress approve $636.5 million for salaries and $263.8 million for general expenses.\n\nUSCP\u2019s current funding bill, approved in March, provides the agency with a total spending level of $791.5 million, with $588.6 million of that dedicated to salaries and $202.8 million for general expenses.\n\nThe House and Senate Appropriations committees will likely release their respective spending bills in the late spring or early summer. The spending process is unlikely to wrap up before Election Day.",

        "text": "Elections reveal a growing gender divide across South Korea\nElections reveal a growing gender divide across South Korea\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images\n\nSEOUL, South Korea \u2013 When South Koreans elect a new parliament this week, the outcome will shape the next four years of the country's politics. But some watchers will be looking to verify a trend that can influence it for decades to come \u2013 the political divide between young men and women.\n\nIn the 2022 presidential election, 59% of male voters between ages 18 and 29 voted for the conservative candidate Yoon Suk Yeol, who eventually won. Their support for Yoon was second only to that of voters aged 60 and older.\n\nBy contrast, young women under 30 were the least supportive constituents for Yoon of all gender-age groups. Only 34% voted for him, according to exit polls.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIn recent major elections, young South Korean men and women have consistently shown around 15 to 30 percentage points' difference in their support of the main political parties.\n\nWhile many other developed countries \u2013 including the United States, Germany and the United Kingdom \u2013 are observing a similar phenomenon, experts say South Korea's fast social development and politicization of gender issues have made its case particularly intense.\n\nPerceptions about gender inequality drive political differences\n\nCompared to democracies with longer histories, South Korea's political gender divide is a relatively recent phenomenon. But it has progressed fast.\n\nPolling expert Jeong Han-wool, who heads the firm Research Institute of Korean People, first noticed the rift during the preceding administration of liberal President Moon Jae-in, who vowed to become a \"feminist president.\"\n\n\"Conservative attitudes started to appear, especially among men in their 20s, first over gender issues. And then they proceeded to anti-Democratic Party, anti-liberal positions,\" he says.\n\nJeong attributes the divergence of opinions on gender issues to South Korea's rapid political and social development.\n\n\"For a long time, patriarchal norms governed South Korean society. But those social norms dissolved with democratization, and I don't think we have established new norms that can fill the vacuum,\" he says.\n\nMoon Jae-in started his term around the time of the MeToo movement, as a new generation of young feminists was emerging in South Korea. They came out to the street in the country's largest protests on women's issues in history to condemn violence against women and persisting inequality.\n\nThe protests were an outburst of pent-up frustrations Korean women have felt throughout the country's modern history, says politics professor Go Min Hee of Ewha Women's University in Seoul.\n\n\"With rapid urbanization, a large number of women moved to cities as laborers. This brought a lot of economic changes but also changes in their perception,\" Go says.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBut, she says, women's social and economic status has not caught up with their growing sense of autonomy.\n\nMany of the young feminists are the first generation of South Korean women who are more educated than their male peers, as women's college enrollment rates started to exceed men's in 2008.\n\n\"Gender gap in education has disappeared with the declining number of children and growing attention to education. But the income gap in the post-education labor market hasn't closed,\" she says.\n\nSouth Korea's gender wage gap remains the largest in the developed world, with women earning 31% less than men as of 2022. There are smaller proportion of women on corporate boards and in parliament than in most other affluent countries.\n\nYoung women may excel in schools and in their early careers. But they wonder if they will be able to stay in the workforce 10 or 20 years later and get paid as much as men do.\n\nMen do not feel they have it easier than women\n\nBut young men see things differently, according to pollster Jeong Han-wool. They grew up seeing girls in their class enjoying equal opportunity and getting better grades than them, he says.\n\n\"Men feel they are falling behind in competitions. And they also have to serve in the military at an important time of their life. But the Democratic Party and the liberal side were only talking about discrimination against women,\" Jeong says.\n\nHe found in a 2019 survey that nearly 70% of men in their 20s think discrimination against men is serious. Many point to mandatory conscription as an example. All able-bodied men must serve for at least 18 months, but not women.\n\nJeon Yesung, a 23-year-old college student in Seoul, remembers scrolling through his Instagram feed while he was in the military.\n\n\"My friends were spending time abroad as exchange students when I had just come back from shoveling. When you zoom in on that moment, it can feel pretty discriminative,\" Jeon says.\n\nHe says he supports gender equality, but he didn't think feminists were pursuing the same goal. He admits, however, that many Korean men, including himself, don't even care to understand what feminism is.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"From what I understood through the media, I've had the idea that feminism is aggressive and hateful toward men,\" he says.\n\nAntagonistic attitudes toward feminism are common across economically developed and culturally liberal countries, according to Alice Evans, a visiting fellow at Stanford University who studies global gender norms.\n\nWhile young men don't share their parents' ideas about gender roles and believe in meritocracy, Evans says, \"the difference now is this sense of resentment, this hostility towards women, the feeling that women are getting unfair advantage.\"\n\nYoung men see efforts for gender parity as unfair, she adds, because of the zero-sum thinking that women's gains come at men's expense.\n\nAnd that sentiment interacts with South Korea's slowing economy and historic sexism, according to Evans.\n\n\"If men are accustomed to high status, if men feel that they deserve to be at the top but are not getting it because they are denied and frustrated,\" she says, \"that's what caused this backlash.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Ahn Young-joon/AP Ahn Young-joon/AP\n\nGender conflict is not solely a young generation's responsibility\n\nBut young men's sense of frustration is not only directed at women. Seong Seokgon, a 26-year-old math major at Seoul's Yonsei University who identifies himself as conservative, says the current conflict is as much about generation as it is about gender.\n\n\"It's not like 20-something men are hurting 20-something women's chances,\" Seong says, arguing young men are unfairly blamed for older generations' faults.\n\n\"In the end, the glass ceiling was made in a more sexist era by men who are now executives,\" he adds.\n\nAnd he says today's South Korea is a harder place for both men and women, as the standards for success have become higher and harder to fulfill. That pressure makes young people more vulnerable to divisive finger-pointing that abounds in online spaces, he says.\n\nAnother college student in Seoul, 24-year-old Kim Hoyun, agrees. He says neither men nor women in South Korea are willing to take a step back and hear each other out because they grew up in a fiercely competitive environment.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"We have only practiced living for our own interests. So instead of seeking room for compromise, I think we are more used to asserting ourselves and securing our gains,\" Kim says.\n\nAnd, he adds, so are the politicians. \"I think the conflict has gotten worse because politicians have abused that to gain votes from certain groups,\" he says.\n\nDuring his election campaign, in a bid to attract young male voters, President Yoon Suk Yeol said structural sexism no longer exists in South Korea and pledged to abolish the ministry for gender equality.\n\nHe has failed to implement the pledge due to resistance from the main opposition Democratic Party, which holds majority control. But in February, two months before the parliamentary elections, he accepted the resignation from the gender equality minister that he had sat on for five months. He did not appoint a replacement.\n\nMeanwhile, the distance between men and women is growing, not just politically but also emotionally.\n\nIn a 2021 survey conducted by South Korean news magazine Sisa IN, over 66% of men in their 20s said they cannot accept feminists as neighbors, colleagues, friends or family.\n\nPollster Jeong Han-wool, who participated in designing and analyzing the survey, found that anti-feminist sentiment is increasingly determining 20-something men's voting behaviors. Their view has even spread to men in their 30s and 40s.\n\n\"Once you identify with a party, inertia develops. And it affects attitudes toward other policies. You start to take traditionally conservative stances, like being critical about welfare,\" he says.\n\nAnd the impact of the widening gap doesn't end in politics, according to Jeong. He is concerned it is also pushing down the country's birth rate.\n\nAt 0.72 per woman, South Korea's birth rate is already the world's lowest. And young people are increasingly unenthusiastic about marriage.\n\nEwha University professor Go Min Hee says mismatched expectations in the dating market can be a reason. What women want from a romantic partner have evolved, she says, and their growing awareness for equality and economic power allows them more choices.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"More choices mean not only that they can choose one person among many, but that they can choose not to choose anyone.\"",

Will it help the Republican candidate or create problems for him at the hustings? This question has become important because the film will also depict Trump's relationship with Roy Cohn , the attorney, who served as co-president of Trump Entertainment. He was a board member of the Eric Trump Foundation, a children's health charity. It is yet to see how 'The Apprentice' portrays the man who was sentenced to three years in federal prison and ordered to pay a $50,000 fine in 2018.According to 'Deadline', the first look of Sebastian Stan as Donald Trump and Jeremy Strong as Roy Cohn has been dropped. Cohn has an important role to play in the movie as he has been shown as a mentor and a protege who charts the origins of a major American dynasty. 'The Apprentice ' will also explore the moral and human cost of a culture defined by winners and losers.Gabriel Sherman has written the script for the Ali Abbasi-directed film. Daniel Bekerman has served as producer for Scythia Films (Canada), Jacob Jarek for Profile Pictures (Denmark), Ruth Treacy and Julianne Forde for Tailored Films (Ireland), alongside Abbasi and Louis Tisne for Film Institute (Denmark). Amy Baer, Mark H. Rapaport, Emanuel Nunez, Josh Marks, Grant S. Johnson, Phil Hunt and Compton Ross, Thorsten Schumacher, Niamh Fagan, Gabe Sherman, Lee Broda and James Shani have worked as executive producers of the film.The star cast of 'The Apprentice' is led by Sebastian Stan who portrays Donald Trump while Jeremy Strong plays Roy Cohn. Maria Bakalova will appear as Trump's daughter Ivana while Martin Donovan will play Fred Trump Senior.'The Apprentice' has been helmed by Iranian-Danish director Abbasi, who most recently had 'Holy Spider' in the Cannes competition.Portrayed by Jeremy Strong, the role of Roy Cohn is significant in 'The Apprentice' because he is the man who acts like a mentor and a protege of Donald Trump. He was sentenced to three years in federal prison and ordered to pay a $50,000 fine in 2018.",

This combination of increased near-term risks and long-term structural changes, or compound volatility, underscores their focus on rapidly and responsibly deploying generative AI (GenAI) across their enterprises, according to a new study released today by KPMG LLP, the U.S. audit, tax, and advisory firm.\n\n\u201cCompound volatility raises costs with little margin for error on strategy development and execution,\u201d said Paul Knopp, KPMG U.S. Chair and CEO. \u201cCEOs must anticipate and outpace these risks by pairing long-term investments with a focus on GenAI and the agility it can create for an organization to take advantage of new opportunities and overcome challenges.\u201d\n\nThe 2024 KPMG U.S. CEO Outlook Pulse Survey features insights from 100 U.S. CEOs at large companies on the key challenges and opportunities in driving business growth with a lens into managing \u201ccompound volatility.\u201d",

        "text": "Nebraska election: The fight for a single electoral vote rages on\nOmaha, Nebraska CNN \u2014\n\nOmaha is a blue dot in a sea of Nebraska red, which is precisely why Donald Trump and his allies are furiously fighting to change the state\u2019s system of awarding electoral votes in presidential elections.\n\nEven after the Nebraska Legislature closed the door on a pressure campaign intended to keep President Joe Biden from winning one of the state\u2019s five electoral votes \u2013 as he did in 2020 by carrying the Omaha-anchored 2nd Congressional District \u2013 Trump loyalists are pledging to keep the effort alive.\n\n\u201cWe are going to keep on pushing and keep on pushing and keep on pushing until Nebraska gets winner-take-all,\u201d said conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who appeared alongside several state Republican officials here Tuesday to rally support for the change. \u201cNebraska could pick a president.\u201d\n\nNebraska Gov. Jim Pillen, a Republican, said this week he was open to calling a special legislative session dedicated to making his state\u2019s presidential contest a winner-take-all affair, all but assuring that Trump would collect the full lot of electoral votes. But Pillen said he would do so only \u201cwhen there is sufficient support in the Legislature to pass it.\u201d\n\nLess than seven months before the November election, the Republican-led effort to change election law in Nebraska, which Democrats have vowed to block, underscores the remarkably close nature of a Biden-Trump rematch and the precarious path to winning a majority in the Electoral College, or 270 electoral votes.\n\n\u201cYou have outsiders trying to change the rules \u2013 you can\u2019t do that,\u201d said Precious McKesson, the executive director of the Nebraska Democratic Party who cast the state\u2019s lone Electoral College vote for Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris in 2020. \u201cRepublicans know that vote is very critical.\u201d\n\nNebraska is one of two states \u2013 along with Maine \u2013 that divide Electoral College votes by congressional district, rather than statewide, winner-take-all rules. Under the system, the statewide winner receives two electoral votes, and the rest are split, one apiece, among the leading vote-getters in each district. As Biden did in Nebraska, Trump benefitted from the system in Maine, a blue state, where he won a single electoral vote in 2016 and 2020 despite losing statewide.\n\nConservative activist Charlie Kirk speaks at a rally in Omaha, Nebraska, on April 9, 2024. CNN\n\nDown to the wire\n\nIt\u2019s hardly a far-fetched scenario that this year\u2019s presidential race could come down to a single electoral vote.\n\nOf this year\u2019s presidential battlegrounds, if Biden carries the so-called blue wall states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania and Trump wins Georgia, Arizona and Nevada, the outcome of Nebraska\u2019s 2nd District could likely tip the balance and keep the race from ending in a 269-269 tie. (In such a scenario, the House of Representatives would decide the winner.)\n\n\u201cIf you believe in the Electoral College, which I do, then why does it make sense for Nebraska to not be following that same idea?\u201d said Becky Rasmussen, who stood in line Tuesday night for the rally Kirk and his organization, Turning Point Action, held at Lord of Hosts Church in Omaha. \u201cWe\u2019re one of the most conservative states and for (Biden) to win even a part of this state is just very disappointing.\u201d\n\nWhile Kirk implored Trump supporters to keep applying pressure on the governor and Republican lawmakers, it remains far from certain that such efforts will be successful, even in deep-red Nebraska.\n\nTo prevail in the state\u2019s unicameral Legislature, 33 senators would have to support a measure to withstand a Democratic-led filibuster. Advisers to both parties told CNN it was unlikely, unless the lobbying campaign from Trump supporters changed the current political dynamic.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about the Biden or Trump campaign. It\u2019s about democracy and whether or not we\u2019re willing to protect it,\u201d said Tony Vargas, a Democratic state senator who represents part of the 2nd District and is making his second bid for the seat this year. \u201cNebraskans really care about this. It\u2019s why we protected it for so long.\u201d\n\nRepublican Rep. Don Bacon, the four-term incumbent in this Biden district, said he supports changing the state\u2019s election law.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re one of two of 50 states, I don\u2019t think it works,\u201d Bacon said. \u201cI think it undermines the influence of Nebraska. I think it should be standardized.\u201d\n\nVoters fill out their ballots at a polling place in Omaha on November 3, 2020. Nati Harnik/AP\n\nA tight election\n\nNebraska Republicans have escalated their efforts in response to the persuasion from conservative activists and Trump allies.\n\n\u201cOne more vote. One more vote. One more vote,\u201d Eric Underwood, the chairman of the Nebraska Republican Party, said Tuesday night as he led rallygoers in a chant.\n\nThe argument from Trump loyalists amounts to a rare, open acknowledgment that the former president is locked in a bitterly close race with Biden. In 2016, Trump swept all five of Nebraska\u2019s electoral votes, which Mitt Romney also did in 2012. In 2008, Barack Obama won the 2nd District on his way to a national landslide.\n\nIf the Nebraska law was changed before November, Republican leaders believe it would effectively cut off one path to victory for Biden and open up new opportunities for Trump in a race that could be decided by the finest \u2013 and most arcane \u2013 of margins.\n\nPillen agreed to call for a special session on the condition that the election bill have the necessary support in the state\u2019s 49-member Legislature. The GOP has a large majority, but the fate of the potential measure is unclear, and the entire matter could land in a legal battle if election rules were changed in the middle of the campaign.\n\nWhile Kirk amped up supporters in Omaha, state lawmakers about an hour away in Lincoln were wrapping up their business for the year despite growing demands from the right to revisit the law.\n\n\u201cIf there is radio silence,\u201d Kirk said, \u201cwe\u2019ll do the next event on the steps of the Capitol.\u201d\n\nKirk\u2019s efforts got a boost Wednesday morning when newly installed Republican National Committee chair Michael Whatley called on the Nebraska GOP to act.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump and Republicans are united: Nebraska should shift to a winner-take-all system for its electoral votes,\u201d Whatley said on social media. \u201cLet\u2019s get this done.\u201d\n\nThe Biden campaign already has its eye on Nebraska, sending second gentleman Doug Emhoff to Omaha to open a Democratic Party office last month. On the wall is a pointed message painted in blue: \u201cProtect the blue dot.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t have this blue dot,\u201d said McKesson, the executive director of the Nebraska Democrats, sending a message to Republicans. \u201cIf you want it, come work hard for it, but we\u2019re going to fight to keep it.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s Manu Raju contributed to this report.",

        "text": "The Election Year Risks of AI\nThis piece was first posted by Time.\n\nOn the eve of New Hampshire\u2019s primary election, a flood of robocalls exhorted Democratic voters to sit out a write-in campaign supporting President Joe Biden during the state\u2019s presidential primary. An AI-generated voice on the line matched the uncanny cadence and signature catchphrase\u2014 (\u201cmalarkey!\u201d)\u2014characteristic to Biden. From that call to fake creations envisioning a cascade of calamities under Biden\u2019s watch to AI deepfakes of a Slovakian candidate for country leader pondering vote rigging and raising beer prices, AI is making its mark on elections worldwide. Against this backdrop, governments and several tech companies are taking some steps to mitigate risks\u2014European lawmakers just approved a watershed law, and as recently as February tech companies signed a pledge at the Munich Security Conference. But much more needs to be done to protect American democracy.\n\nIn Munich, companies including OpenAI, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, TikTok, Google, X, and others announced a compact to undertake measures to protect elections as America and other countries go to the polls in 2024. The companies pledged to help audiences track the origin of AI-generated and authentic content, to try to detect deceptive AI media in elections, and to deploy \u201creasonable precautions\u201d to curb risks from AI-fueled election trickery. While not unwelcome, the success of the compact will depend on how its commitments are executed. They were couched in slippery language\u2014\u201cproportionate responses,\u201d \u201cwhere appropriate and technically feasible,\u201d \u201cattempting to,\u201d and so on\u2014that give latitude to companies to do very little if they so choose. While some are taking further steps, of course, the urgency of the situation demands stronger and more universal action.\n\nThis year is the first national American election since AI developments will allow fraudsters to produce phony but close-to-perfect pictures, video, or audio of candidates and officials doing or saying almost anything with minimal time, little to no cost, and on a widespread basis. And the technology underlying generative AI chatbots lets hoaxers spoof election websites or spawn pretend news sites in a matter of seconds and on a mammoth scale. It also gives bad actors\u2014 foreign and domestic\u2014the ability to conduct supercharged, hard-to-track interactive influence campaigns.\n\nAs generative AI is integrated into common search engines and voters converse with chatbots, people seeking basic information about elections have at times been met with misinformation, pure bunkum, or links to fringe websites. A recent study by AI Democracy Projects and Proof News indicated that popular AI tools\u2014including Google\u2019s Gemini, OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4, and Meta\u2019s Llama 2\u2014 \u201cperformed poorly on accuracy\u201d when fed certain election questions. The more traditional, non-generative AI could fuel mass challenges to thousands of voters\u2019 eligibility, risking wrongful purges from voter rolls and burdening election offices. As election officials consider using new AI tools in their day-to-day tasks, the lack of meaningful regulation risks putting some voting access in harm\u2019s way even as AI unlocks time-saving opportunities for short-staffed offices.\n\nBefore the Munich conference the world\u2019s premier generative AI operation, OpenAI, had recently announced a slate of company policies designed to curtail election harms as America votes in 2024. These include forbidding users from building custom AI chatbots that impersonate candidates, barring users from deploying OpenAI tools to spread falsehoods about when and how to vote, and encrypting images with digital codes that will help observers figure out whether OpenAI\u2019s Dall-E made an image that is multiplying in the wild.\n\nBut these actions\u2014while more robust than those of some other major AI companies to date\u2014fall short in important ways and underscore the limitations of what we may see in future months as OpenAI and other tech giants make gestures towards honoring the commitments made in Munich. First: the company\u2019s public-facing policies do not call out several core false narratives and depictions that have haunted prior election cycles and are likely to be resurrected in new guises this year. For example, they do not expressly name fakeries that supposedly show election officials interfering with the vote count, fabrications of unreliable or impaired voting machines, or baseless claims that widespread voter fraud has occurred. (According to Brennan Center tracking, these rank among the most common false narratives promoted by election deniers in the 2022 midterm elections.) While OpenAI policies addressing misleading others and intentional deception arguably cover some, or all, such content, specifically naming these categories as being barred from creation and spread would give more clarity to users and protection to voters. Since election procedures\u2014 and the occasional fast-resolved Election Day glitch\u2014vary from county to county, the company should have conduits for the sharing of information between local election officials and OpenAI staff in the months leading up to the election.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, the tech wunderkind needs to do more to curb the risks of working with third party developers\u2014that is, the companies that license OpenAI\u2019s technology and integrate its models into their own services and products. For instance, if a user enters basic election questions into a third-party search engine that cannibalizes OpenAI models, the answers can be rife with errors, outdated facts, and other blunders. (WIRED reporting on Microsoft Copilot last December revealed several issues at that time with the search engine\u2014which uses OpenAI technology\u2014 though some of those problems may have since been addressed.) To better protect voters this election season, the company must create and enforce stricter requirements for its partnerships with developers that integrate OpenAI models into search engines\u2014or any digital platform where voters may go to seek information on the ABCs of voting and elections. While the accord signed in Munich was targeted to intentionally deceptive content, voters can also be harmed by AI \u201challucinations\u201d\u2014fabrications spit out by systems\u2019 algorithms\u2014or other hiccups that AI creators and service providers have failed to prevent.\n\nBut, OpenAI can\u2019t go it alone. Other tech titans must release their own election policies for generative AI tools, unmasking any behind-the-scenes tinkering and opening internal practices to public scrutiny and knowledge. As a first step, more major tech companies\u2014including Apple, ByteDance, Samsung, and X\u2014should sign onto the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity\u2019s open standard for embedding content with digital markers that help prove that it is AI-generated or authentic as it travels through the online ether. (While Apple and X committed to consider attaching similar signals to their content in Munich, a consistent standard would improve detection and coordination across the board.) The markers, meanwhile, should be made more difficult to remove. And social media companies must act swiftly to address deepfakes and bot accounts that mimic human activity, as well as instituting meaningful account verification processes for election officials and bonafide news organizations to help voters find accurate information in feeds flush with misinformation, impersonators, and accounts masquerading as real news.\n\nOne company\u2019s\u2014or a handful of companies\u2019 \u2014steps to address election harms, while important, are not enough in a landscape awash with unsecured, open-source AI models where systems\u2019 underlying code and the mathematical instructions that make them tick are publicly available, downloadable, and manipulatable. Companies as prominent as Meta and Stability AI have released unsecured AI systems, and other players have rapidly churned out many more. Anyone who wishes to interfere in elections today has a suite of AI technology to choose from to bolster their efforts, and multiple ways to deploy it. That means that governments at all levels must also take urgent action to protect voters.\n\nCongress, agencies, and states have a plethora of options at hand to blunt AI\u2019s risks ahead of the 2024 election. Congress and states should regulate deepfakes\u2014particularly those spread by campaigns, political action committees, and paid influencers\u2014by requiring disclaimers on deceptive and digitally manipulated images, video, and audio clips that could suppress votes, or that misrepresent candidates\u2019 and election officials\u2019 words and actions. Lawmakers should also require campaigns and political action committees to clearly label a subset of content produced by the technology underlying generative AI chatbots, particularly where politicos deploy the technology to engage in continuous conversations with voters or to deceptively impersonate humans to influence elections. Policymakers should protect voters against frivolous challenges to their voting eligibility by setting constraints on the evidence that may be used to substantiate a challenge \u2014 including evidence unearthed or created through AI.\n\nFederal agencies should act quickly to publish guidance for certifying the authenticity and provenance of government content\u2014as envisioned by the executive order on AI issued by the administration last year\u2014and state and local election officials should apply similar practices to their official content. Longer term, federal and state governments should also create guidance and benchmarks that help election officials evaluate AI systems before purchasing them, checking for reliability, accuracy, biases, and transparency.\n\nThese steps are all pivotal to dealing with challenges that arise specifically from AI technology. But the election risks that AI amplifies\u2014disinformation, vote suppression, election security hazards, and so on\u2014long predate the advent of the generative-AI boom. To fully protect voting and elections, lawmakers must also pass reforms like the Freedom to Vote Act\u2014a set of wide-ranging provisions that stalled in the U.S. Senate. It also means updating political ad disclosure requirements for the 21st century. And it means maintaining an expansive vision for democracy that is impervious to age-old and persistent efforts to subvert it.",

Andrew Caballero-reynolds | AFP | Getty Images\n\nThe Biden administration is moving ahead quickly with its new student loan forgiveness plan, with hopes of starting to wipe out people's debts as soon as this fall. That action could prove crucial in the upcoming presidential election, experts say. Issues that \"present a sharp contrast between Democrats and Republicans are more likely to impact the election, especially if the issues affect voter turnout for one party over the other,\" said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. Student loan forgiveness falls into that category, he said.\n\nA race to still forgive debt after Supreme Court verdict\n\nCan Biden get borrowers relief by November?\n\nKantrowitz said he anticipates the Biden administration will try to get people the new relief before they cast their votes in November. Almost half of voters in a recent survey, or 48%, said canceling student loan debt is an important issue to them in the 2024 presidential and congressional elections. SocialSphere, a research and consulting firm, polled 3,812 registered voters, including 2,601 Gen Z and millennial respondents, in mid-March.\n\nwatch now\n\nForgiving student debt could especially help Biden with young voters, a demographic he has been struggling with. About 70% of Gen Z respondents said student debt cancellation was important to them in the election, that same survey found. The issue is a chance for Biden to differentiate himself from his likely Republican opponent Donald Trump, who has a record of opposing debt relief for students.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump speaks during a press conference at 40 Wall Street on March 25, 2024 in New York City. Michael M. Santiago | Getty Images\n\nWhile in office, the former president called for the elimination of the popular Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, signed into law by President George W. Bush in 2007. Trump also sided with the Supreme Court in its ruling to strike down Biden's plan. \"Today, the Supreme Court also ruled that President Biden cannot wipe out hundreds of billions, perhaps trillions of dollars, in student loan debt, which would have been very unfair to the millions and millions of people who paid their debt through hard work and diligence; very unfair,\" Trump said at a campaign event in June 2023.\n\nLegal threats already brewing\n\nBiden rolled out his first student loan forgiveness plan in August 2022 through an executive action, which he hoped would allow him to deliver the relief quickly. Borrowers were told they could expect the relief within six weeks after applying. That timeline was stymied, of course, by legal challenges and eventually dashed at the Supreme Court.\n\nIssues like student loan forgiveness, which present a sharp contrast between Democrats and Republicans, are more likely to impact the election.

        "text": "Sometimes the Good Guys Win: Guatemala\u2019s Shocking 2023 Election\nGuatemala\u2019s 2023 elections were a turning point for the country. Despite a playing field tilted to favor the governing elite, voters elected Bernardo Ar\u00e9valo, whose Semilla (\u201cSeed\u201d) Movement promised to break the country\u2019s cycles of corruption, restoring democracy and the rule of law. Success was \u2014 and remains \u2014 far from inevitable. The kleptocracy pushed back hard, using their control of the public prosecutors\u2019 office to open spurious investigations and pursue unsupported claims of electoral fraud.\n\nWhat comes next matters not just for Guatemala but also for regional and U.S. security. Although Latin America has no ongoing interstate conflicts, it is home to 42 of the 50 most dangerous cities in the world. While the sources of violence vary widely, from gang activity and organized crime to unresolved civil conflicts to weak judicial institutions, a common thread across the region is the absence of viable mechanisms for reducing violence and social conflict.\n\nGuatemala appears to suffer from a particularly entrenched dynamic of corruption, social conflict and criminal violence, which has left the country struggling to progress, even after the formal end of the brutal civil war of the 1980s. For many, that war never really ended. A new USIP essay series by Ambassador Stephen McFarland explores how Guatemalan citizens \u2014 assisted by the international community \u2014 generated an unexpected and potentially historic opportunity to move past previous cycles of violence and conflict.\n\nGuatemala is particularly important from Washington\u2019s perspective because internal developments there touch on a broad range of U.S. national interests. It has the biggest population and the largest economy in Central America. It has long been a major source of irregular migration to U.S. borders and a transit country for migrants crossing from South into North America, as well as a route for illicit drugs. Corruption, instability and conflict in Guatemala and its Central American neighbors directly affects U.S. security, often to a greater extent than better known geopolitical hotspots.\n\nThis series examines how Guatemalan individuals, institutions, ancestral Indigenous leaders and civil society \u2014 plus the foreign governments and multilateral organizations that supported them \u2014 have thus far outplayed their autocratic, corrupt adversaries. It also looks at the implications of what happened in Guatemala for regional efforts to curb the corruption that is undermining democratic governance, driving massive irregular migration and empowering organized criminal networks.\n\nPart I explores how and why efforts to tilt the playing field in favor of the governing party instead opened the door for Ar\u00e9valo\u2019s unexpected electoral victory. Part II looks at how the combination of international pressure and domestic protests thwarted attempts to prevent the president-elect from taking power. Finally, part III provides lessons for policymakers seeking to isolate corrupt actors and deter efforts to disrupt and undermine democratic elections. It also discusses the challenges ahead and how the U.S. government and its partners can help Guatemala\u2019s democratic leaders to overcome them.\n\nBest-Laid Plans\n\nThe pivotal issue during the 2023-24 electoral process was whether Guatemala\u2019s government should serve all citizens or continue to provide preferential treatment for those in power. Thirty-seven years after the 1986 elections ended decades of military-dominated rule, Guatemalan democracy teetered atop extreme inequality and exclusion, a weak state captured by corruption and ruled by authoritarians, and an economic model increasingly dependent upon migration and remittances. Traditional political and economic leaders had run out of ideas beyond narrow self-interest.\n\nA year before, no one in Guatemala expected the so-called \u201cpacto de los corruptos,\u201d or the \"pact\u201d hereafter \u2014 an alliance of government officials, politicians, prosecutors, judges, party financiers, state contractors and some wealthy families \u2014 would lose the elections. They had the best-known candidates, they had money and they controlled \u2014 or so they thought \u2014 the judiciary and the electoral authorities. More than eight years of increasingly mediocre and corrupt government had reinforced voters\u2019 fundamental assumption that all parties were equally flawed.\n\nBut as the boxer Mike Tyson said, \u201cEveryone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.\u201d The pact overlooked or misinterpreted mutually reinforcing factors leading to their electoral loss. They underestimated rising citizen resentment of the status quo and dismissed Ar\u00e9valo and the Semilla Movement as a credible alternative. They misjudged the determination of Indigenous authorities to defend the electoral results and of civil society and journalists to inform and rally citizens, despite intimidation and arrests. They also failed to anticipate that certain judicial and electoral authorities would defend the electoral results even in the face of intense pressure. And finally, they ignored or dismissed the impact of international pressure, including U.S. outreach and sanctions.\n\nThe Pact, State Capture and the Eclipse of Democracy\n\nGuatemala\u2019s 2023 election process occurred in an increasingly authoritarian, kleptocratic state. Since Guatemala\u2019s 1986 transition from military to democratic rule, corruption has metastasized, transforming Guatemala into a captured state in which self-interest had become the organizing principle of politics. The old adage of, \u201cyes he steals, but he gets things done,\u201d went out the window. With politicians and operators stealing ever more public money, there was less to spend on projects and services. Illicit money procured votes in Congress and cemented local alliances while politicians and corrupt officials lined their pockets.\n\nThe pact had first banded together in 2019 to terminate the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG), a hybrid, U.N.-sponsored initiative that brought international investigators together with Guatemalan prosecutors to dismantle criminal organizations operating in collusion with state officials. But closing CICIG was not enough. Attorney General Consuelo Porras turned against the Guatemalan judges and prosecutors who had pursued corruption cases, replacing them and then threatening them with prosecution for alleged irregularities. By early 2023, some three-dozen former Guatemalan anti-corruption prosecutors, judges, and civil society leaders had sought asylum, mostly in the United States. Journalists also fled, especially after the arrest of former newspaper publisher Jos\u00e9 Ruben Zamora in July 2022.\n\nBy early 2023, it appeared that incumbent President Alejandro Giammattei and his supporters controlled not only the executive branch, Congress, the judiciary and the Attorney General\u2019s office (also known as the Public Ministry), but also the Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE), the Comptroller\u2019s office and the Human Rights Ombudsman. They had secured the support or the neutrality of most of the wealthy elite, including a private sector umbrella group called the Coordinating Committee of Agricultural, Commercial, Industrial, and Financial Associations (CACIF). Giammattei and his allies dismissed the impact of international sanctions, assuming that increasing migration and remittances from the United States would provide a safety valve and economic growth. They saw the democratic opposition as small, weak and lacking a credible candidate. The 2023 election seemed theirs for the taking \u2014 all they needed to do was to decide which candidate they preferred.\n\nA Managed Election That Escaped Control\n\nGiammattei was the strongest president in Guatemala\u2019s post-1985 era. He was also among the most disliked: arrogant, abusive, corrupt, ineffective and indifferent to ordinary citizens. Voters want results, and Giammattei \u2014 and his two predecessors \u2014 had failed to deliver. Scandals undermined his government, including the shady procurement of Russian COVID-19 vaccines, many of which remained unused. Shoddy highway construction reminded citizens of the impact of corruption on a daily basis.\n\nDespite government pressure and the loss of private advertising, Guatemala\u2019s investigative journalists reported extensively on the scandals in a target rich environment. \u201cMore of the same\u201d was not an effective campaign slogan for 2023. Rather than support the apparently stronger candidacies of potential allies, such as conservative Zury Rios, Giammattei gambled he could steer the election to his own party\u2019s candidate, the uncharismatic but pliable Manuel Conde. This would allow him to remain the power behind the throne.\n\nA key element in Giammattei\u2019s calculation was the presidential bid of Sandra Torres of the National Unity for Hope Party (UNE), who was almost guaranteed to advance to the runoff, but whose high negatives made it unlikely she could win. Hardworking, extremely ambitious and much better at governing than Giammattei, Torres, was a former first lady who reputedly co-governed with her husband, Alvaro Colom, during his 2008-2012 presidency. But many conservative elites considered her a leftist \u2014 her National Unity for Hope party belongs to the Socialist International \u2014 while others distrusted her as a corrupt operator who allegedly made deals with the government to escape prosecution on campaign financing charges.\n\nThis meant that whoever managed to win a place in the first round and then run against Torres in the final had an excellent chance to win the presidency, just as Giammattei himself had done in 2019. To ensure that Conde made it to the runoff, Giammattei got the TSE to remove three rival candidates: Thelma Cabrera, an indigenous activist, Roberto Arzu, a conservative populist and son of a former president, and Carlos Pineda, another conservative populist who had been leading in the polls. The TSE left on the ballot candidates from smaller parties, including Semilla\u2019s Ar\u00e9valo, whom no one thought had a chance to win.\n\nSemilla, meanwhile, conducted a campaign focused on good governance, fighting corruption and responding to citizens\u2019 needs. The movement was unique among Guatemalan political parties in having no owners. It had no financing from shadowy businessmen, advertised little in traditional media and held no flashy campaign events. Semilla and Ar\u00e9valo stressed values and actions over ideology and provided voters an unexpected credible alternative to the status quo.\n\nUnlike most of his rivals, Ar\u00e9valo had no sense of entitlement or lust for power \u2014 he was an anti-candidate in Guatemalan politics. An older, moderate legislator in a new center-left party with mainly young, urban supporters, he had started his campaign with zero illusions of winning. Though little known himself, Ar\u00e9valo had an illustrious surname as the son of Juan Jos\u00e9 Ar\u00e9valo, Guatemala\u2019s first democratically elected president who ruled during a short-lived \u201cdemocratic spring\u201d in the 1940s. He gave up running for re-election to Congress to conduct one last campaign on behalf of Semilla.\n\nAnd The Last Shall Be First\n\nThe June 25, 2023, first-round vote stunned the country: Ar\u00e9valo and the Semilla party placed second, winning a spot in a runoff against Torres. As the returns came in, Semilla poll observers reportedly took selfies with the initial results on their monitors, joking that they needed to do so before the results changed.\n\nOutpolling both Torres and Ar\u00e9valo were historically high null and blank votes, which reflected massive citizen disenchantment with the status quo. Government party Vamos candidate Manuel Conde finished third.\n\nThe immediate reaction of the losing parties was to claim election fraud, but they had no credible theory, let alone proof. The electoral missions of the Organization of American States (OAS), the European Union (EU) and Guatemalan civil society had confirmed the validity of the June 25 vote. Guatemala\u2019s election vote-counting mechanisms, based on paper ballots with observers from all parties, had never been seriously challenged in nearly four decades. An initial recount in Guatemala City revealed that Semilla had received a few more votes than initially reported.\n\nThe OAS and its secretary-general, Luis Almagro, issued strong statements of support for the election process, as did the United States and the EU. In a significant move, the Constitutional Court sent the complaint over to the TSE, which in turn refused to modify the results. CACIF issued a cautious but clear statement that supported the electoral process, distancing itself from the government.\n\nThese decisions doomed efforts to annul the first-round vote. In the August 20 run-off, Ar\u00e9valo beat Torres, who refused to concede, by 20 percentage points. Despite the ruling establishment\u2019s best efforts, Ar\u00e9valo had prevailed at the ballot box. But the kleptocracy was not ready to relinquish its hold on power.\n\nThe next article in this series will explain how domestic protest and international pressure staved off a last-ditch effort to prevent the president-elect from taking power.\n\nStephen G.

Wade and removed the nationwide right to abortion.\n\nSince that 2022 decision, most Republican-controlled states have new abortion restrictions in effect, including 14 that ban it at every stage of pregnancy. Most Democrat-dominated states have laws or executive orders to protect access.\n\nAdditionally, voters in seven states \u2014 California, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Montana, Ohio and Vermont \u2014 have sided with abortion rights supporters on ballot measures.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear yet how many states will vote on measures to enshrine abortion access in November.

And there\u2019s legal wrangling in the process in some states.\n\nSome of the efforts have already failed to reach ballots.

A Louisiana measure to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution died in committee and one in Maine effectively died when it fell short of receiving the approval of two-thirds of the House.\n\nWhat to know about Trump\u2019s second term:\n\nStaffing the administration: Here are the people Trump has picked recess appointments Follow all of our coverage as Donald Trump assembles his second administration.\n\nWHAT\u2019S SECURELY ON 2024 BALLOTS?\n\nFLORIDA\n\nThe state Supreme Court ruled on April 1 that a ballot measure to legalize abortion until viability could go on the ballot despite a legal challenge from state Attorney General Ashley Moody, who argued that there are differing views on the meaning of \u201cviability\u201d and that some key terms in the proposed measure are not properly defined.\n\nAdvocates collected nearly a million signatures to put a state constitutional amendment to legalize abortion until viability on the ballot, surpassing the nearly 892,000 required.\n\nSixty percent of voters would have to agree for it to take effect.\n\nAbortion is legal in Florida through the first 15 weeks of pregnancy. But a separate April 1 state Supreme Court ruling upholding the current law triggers a 2023 law would drop that to six weeks \u2014 often before women know they\u2019re pregnant \u2014 to take effect on May 1.\n\nMARYLAND\n\nMaryland voters this year will also be asked whether to enshrine the right for women to end their pregnancies in the state\u2019s constitution in a ballot question put before them by lawmakers last year. The state already protects the right to abortion under state law and Democrats outnumber Republicans 2-1. Abortion is allowed in Maryland until viability.\n\nNEW YORK\n\nNew York lawmakers agreed to ask voters to bar discrimination on the basis of pregnancy, pregnancy outcome and reproductive healthcare as part of a broader equal protection amendment. It would also bar discrimination on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin and disability. The language of the constitutional amendment does not mention abortion specifically. Abortion is allowed in New York law until viability.\n\nWHERE ELSE COULD ABORTION BE ON THE BALLOT IN 2024?\n\nARIZONA\n\nA signature drive is underway to add a constitutional right to abortion in Arizona. Under the measure, the state would not be able to ban abortion until the fetus is viable, with later abortions allowed to protect a woman\u2019s physical or mental health. Supporters must gather nearly 384,000 valid signatures by July 4. An April 9 Arizona Supreme Court decision allows a ban on abortion throughout pregnancy to be enforced starting April 23.\n\nARKANSAS\n\nProponents of an amendment to allow abortion in many cases have until July 5 to gather nearly 91,000 valid signatures to get it on the Nov. 5 ballot. The measure would bar laws banning abortion in the first 20 weeks of gestation and allow abortion later in pregnancy in cases of rape, incest, threats to the woman\u2019s health or life, or if the fetus would be unlikely to survive birth. Because it allows limits as soon as 20 weeks, the proposal does not have the support of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, which includes Arkansas. The state has a ban on abortion at all stages of pregnancy with narrow exceptions.\n\nCOLORADO\n\nThere are dueling efforts on abortion in Colorado. One measure would create a voter-initiated law to ban access throughout pregnancy and the other would amend the state constitution to protect it. The abortion rights amendment would also require Medicaid and private health insurance to cover abortion.\n\nSupporters on each side have to submit more than 124,000 signatures to get a measure on the ballot. The deadlines to submit them are April 15 for the ban measure and April 26 for the one to ensure access. Amending the constitution in Colorado requires the support of 55% of voters. But the ban could be passed with a simple majority. Abortion is legal at all stages of pregnancy in Colorado.\n\nMISSOURI\n\nPushes are underway to get multiple abortion-related ballot measures before Missouri voters in 2024. Abortion rights advocates in Missourians for Constitutional Freedom are pushing for one that would guarantee abortion is legal until viability.\n\nA group of moderate Republicans are taking a different approach and calling for an amendment that would allow abortion up to 12 weeks, and after that only under limited exceptions.\n\nSupporters of each measure must submit more than 171,000 valid signatures by May 5 to get them on the ballot.\n\nAnd some Republican lawmakers have launched a legislative process to put before voters a measure to enshrine a ban on abortion in the state constitution. It would expand provide an exception to allow for immediate abortion to save the life of the woman or in cases \u201cfor which a delay will create a serious risk of substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function.\u201d Further exceptions would have to be approved by voters.\n\nAbortion is currently banned in Missouri at all stages of pregnancy with limited exceptions.\n\nMONTANA\n\nAbortion rights proponents in Montana have proposed a constitutional amendment that would bar the government from denying the right to abortion before viability or when it\u2019s necessary to protect the life or health of the pregnant person. After a legal battle over the ballot language, the Montana Supreme Court on April 1 wrote its version of the language that would appear on the ballot if supporters gather more than 60,000 signatures by June 21. Abortion is legal until viability in Montana under a 1999 Montana Supreme Court opinion.\n\nNEBRASKA\n\nAdvocates are trying to collect about 125,000 signatures needed by July 5 to put a constitutional amendment before voters to protect abortion rights until fetal viability. Under a law adopted last year, abortion is banned after 12 weeks, with some exceptions.\n\nNEVADA\n\nSignatures are being gathered to place an abortion access amendment on Nevada\u2019s ballot in November. Under the amendment, abortion access for the first 24 weeks of pregnancy or later to protect the health of the pregnant person, which is already assured under a 1990 law, would be enshrined in the constitution. It requires more than 102,000 valid signatures by June 26 to place the measure on the ballot. Voters would need to approve it in both 2024 and 2026 to change the constitution.\n\nThe measure is one of several attempts by Nevada abortion rights groups to get a ballot question before voters in 2024 or 2026.\n\nSOUTH DAKOTA\n\nSouth Dakota advocates are attempting to gather more than 35,000 signatures by May 7 to get a measure on the ballot that would loosen restrictions but does not go as far as many abortion rights advocates would like. It would ban any restrictions on abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy. It would allow the state in the second trimester to \u201cregulate the pregnant woman\u2019s abortion decision and its effectuation only in ways that are reasonably related to the physical health of the pregnant woman.\u201d An abortion ban would be allowed in the third trimester, as long as it included exceptions for the life and health of the woman. Planned Parenthood is not supporting the measure.\n\nAbortion in the state is now banned at all stages of pregnancy with narrow exceptions.\n\nWHICH STATES CAN BUT LIKELY WON\u2019T PUT ABORTION ON THE BALLOT?\n\nThere are some states where the balance of power or other circumstances make abortion-related measures \u2014 most of them seeking bans or limits \u2014 unlikely to reach voters in 2024.\n\nIOWA\n\nTo put a constitutional amendment on the ballot, Iowa lawmakers have to approve it in two consecutive sessions. In 2021, both chambers advanced a resolution to find there is no constitutional right to abortion in the state. Republicans control the Legislature and governor\u2019s office, but the amendment has not emerged as a priority this year and Gov. Kim Reynolds has said she\u2019ll let the issue move through the courts rather than pushing for a vote. Abortion is currently banned 20 weeks into pregnancy. A stricter ban, which would kick in when cardiac activity can be detected, around six weeks, has been adopted but put on hold by a court.\n\nPENNSYLVANIA\n\nPennsylvania has a similar process as Iowa with a similar amendment to find no constitutional right to abortion up for consideration. Lawmakers passed it in 2022. But Democrats have since taken control of the state House, making it unlikely to pass, which is required before it can go to a statewide referendum. Abortion is now legal in Pennsylvania up to 24 weeks of pregnancy.",

        "text": "To run for president in 2028, Gretchen Whitmer must deliver Michigan in 2024 | Opinion\nJohn Lindstrom\n\nContributing columnist\n\nWhen Gov. Gretchen Whitmer leaves office, her portrait will be displayed in the state Capitol.\n\nBut will it be displayed in the rotunda with the other governors, or next to the portrait of former President Gerald Ford \u2015 the first Michigander to serve as president of the United States?\n\nIt\u2019s too early to forecast where Whitmer\u2019s portrait will be stationed. But it\u2019s not too early to say Whitmer is attracting national attention as a possible presidential candidate \u2014 more interest than any other potential candidate from Michigan since Ford himself.\n\nShe\u2019s featured often in the publications and news sites political junkies follow the most, like the New York Times, The Washington Post and Politico. Some have speculated \u2014 hoped, even \u2014 that Whitmer might be a candidate in this year\u2019s presidential contest. But really, we\u2019re talking about 2028.\n\nAnd Whitmer, officially coy about seeking higher office once her term ends in 2026, has helped lay the bricks for the speculation. In American politics, the clearest evidence you plan to run for president is to write about book about yourself, and publishing giant Simon & Schuster just announced that in July, it will release \u201cTrue Gretch: What I Learned About Life, Leadership and Everything in Between.\u201d\n\nStill, attention is one thing. Running for president, let alone winning, is the most daunting electoral task in the world.\n\nAll Gretchen Whitmer needs to win a presidential election is ...\n\nIn theory, \u201call\u201d one needs to win the presidency is a charming personal style, a superb campaign organization, tons of money, a message and platform the public immediately identifies with and endorses, and no major disasters. Well, no major disasters for your campaign; the other guy can have plenty.\n\nWinning requires plain dumb luck as much as anything else. In every presidential election, one can trace the incidents and situational realities that overwhelmed logic, organization and planning and even major disasters to determine victory.\n\nShould Whitmer truly throw one of her rumpled baseball caps into the 2028 presidential ring \u2014 and she made another broad hint at the Gridiron dinner held last month by the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. saying she would be back in 2029 \u2014 she has lots of work ahead: preparing for things she should be able to control, and those she can\u2019t.\n\nMichigan politics are in Whitmer's genes\n\nFor this reporter, it would be fascinating should Whitmer run for president \u2014 and should she win \u2014 because the first time I met her, she was a little kid.\n\nMy first encounter with Whitmer came after I and other reporters wrung her father, Dick Whitmer, through the ringer on the television interview show \u201cOff the Record.\u201d Dick was a top executive \u2014 and later CEO \u2014 of Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Michigan. He joined the company as it was churning both corporate and political turmoil in the late 1970s. Dick was the lamb offered for sacrifice to we reporters. And we left him shaking. No lie.\n\nWhen the show ended, I spied Dick standing by the director\u2019s booth. When the door opened, two little girls stepped out, dressed in their best school attire. \u201cWas it fun?\u201d he asked his daughters. One of those girls is now our governor.\n\nWhitmer went to Michigan State University, intending to become a sports reporter, and sort of stumbled into politics genetically: Dick Whitmer, a Republican, was once in former Gov. William Milliken\u2019s administration. Her mother, Sherry, was a Democrat.\n\nFirst as a resident of the Lansing area, and then as a legislator, Whitmer was no stranger to the public, and reporters. In her East Lansing neighborhood, she was often seen at stores and restaurants.\n\nThat\u2019s one of her major strengths: a sense of accessibility, openness and authenticity. That\u2019s been limited since she became governor (a wide range of reporters complain about her press operation). But she still has that casual, authentic air. She can be funny, and often sarcastic.\n\nHer campaign to \u201cFix the damn roads\u201d was in character because, dammit, she swears. Anyone around her can tell you that. She is completely comfortable in videos enthusiastically embracing her adored dogs, saying she loves them, and then telling them to get lost. While she\u2019s proud her kids went to the University of Michigan, she can\u2019t completely hide the Spartan regret.\n\nWhen she filed her petitions for governor in 2018, her husband, Marc Mallory, walked up from his dental practice in downtown Lansing. Whitmer gave him a smooch, then smiling widely, hung onto Mallory\u2019s coat and shouted to reporters, \u201cI married my dentist!\u201d\n\nWhitmer is tough, pragmatic and popular\n\nThough casual, she\u2019s protective of her family. While her mother was sick, Whitmer handled her care, while also serving in the Legislature and caring for her own family. She didn\u2019t dwell on the situation, but people knew how tough she had it.\n\nShe also stared down controversy, largely by ignoring it, over taking private flights to check on her ill father during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAnd when in the Michigan Senate, Whitmer was tough enough to reveal that as a college student she had been sexually assaulted in an effort to convince fellow legislators to provide some exceptions in an anti-abortion bill.\n\nShe\u2019s tough. It\u2019s not an act. She didn\u2019t cower or shake when the 2020 plot to kidnap and kill her was revealed. She was pissed and ready to fight. Every time former President Donald Trump has taken a swat at her, she\u2019s hit back.\n\nIf Whitmer one day occupies the Oval Office, these are things I will remember about her. But getting there is a very big \u201cif.\u201d\n\nThe 2028 election is still four years off \u2014 with the 2024 election to get through first \u2014 but Whitmer would enter the ring with some definite advantages. It is reasonable to expect Democrats to have a woman heading the ticket in 2028. She has a clear record, with legitimate accomplishments, some achieved even when the Legislature was totally run by Republicans who blocked her every effort. Her first attempt at a road funding program was drowned aborning by the GOP, but she was able to get around Republican blockades to fund road repairs via bond sales, for example.\n\nIn some respects, though she likely would grouse at the comparison, she\u2019s governed like former Gov. John Engler: taking deals when she had to, never giving up on her ultimate goals, and when Democrats won control of the Legislature in 2022, running hard to push through as much of her agenda as she could.\n\n2024 is vital if Whitmer has 2028 ambitions\n\nHere in Michigan, her administration has been popular, and she could \u2014 emphasis on \u201ccould\u201d \u2014 carry that nationally.\n\nHer popularity has enjoyed some luck. She had big advantages running in both 2018 and 2022 (in the 2018 midterm, former President Donald Trump dragged down every GOP candidate; and in 2022 Republicans were such a Trump-driven mess Whitmer\u2019s opponent, Tudor Dixon, lost the moment she announced she was running).\n\nBut Whitmer ran tough, focused campaigns, able to adapt when needed while staying on message, and \u2014 this is important \u2014 not falling for the traps set for her.\n\nRight now, Whitmer\u2019s popularity may be her biggest advantage, but some Democrats complain she isn\u2019t using it to the party\u2019s best interests \u2014 and her own.\n\nSome Democrats believe Whitmer should be working more actively for the party in the 2024 election.\n\nAnd to be a factor in 2028, she has to deliver big prizes in 2024.\n\nWhitmer must deliver Michigan for Biden, other key Democratic races\n\nPresident Joe Biden must win Michigan to win re-election, but that\u2019s just one critical race in this state in 2024.\n\nCongress is in play. To keep control of the U.S. Senate, Democrats cannot afford to lose a single seat they now hold, and with Democratic U.S. Sen. Debbie Stabenow retiring, the state will see a tough U.S. Senate race.\n\nAnd in the U.S. House, Michigan Dems must keep the seat won by U.S Rep Hillary Scholten, D-Grand Rapids, in 2022, retain the seat U.S. Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Lansing, is vacating to run for Senate, and shoot for another possible pick-up in the 10th district, now represented by U.S. Rep. John James, R-Sterling Heights.\n\nFinally, Democrats hold Michigan\u2019s state House by a thread and the newly redrawn districts \u2014 ordered by the U.S. Courts \u2014 have further frayed that control.\n\nMeaning Whitmer must be cheek-to-cheek with all Democratic candidates in all races through 2024, pushing their names, promoting their issues, raising money for them and the party, and trashing Republicans. She needs to do commercials for Biden now, one individual told me \u2014 Whitmer is a co-chair of Biden's re-election campaign \u2014 then move on to the other races.\n\nAnother top Democratic strategist, speaking anonymously, said Whitmer must move faster and harder on issues voters care about. She is all over abortion rights and women\u2019s rights (she\u2019s been in Arizona carrying that message). Great, the strategist said, but she\u2019s lagging on immigration, which voters are focused on now.\n\nWhitmer must repeatedly hammer Trump and Republicans for their failures on immigration, the strategist said \u2014 crucial now, as Trump is pinpointing Michigan following the murder of a Grand Rapids woman, allegedly by a man she was dating who had jumped the southern border twice illegally, once during Trump\u2019s administration. (A few days after I spoke to the strategist, Whitmer did exactly that.)\n\nWhitmer should blast Republicans for yielding to Trump, shutting down an immigration control compromise because Trump didn\u2019t want Biden to get credit. She should also point out that nearly 2 million undocumented people crossed the southern border when Trump was president and that Republicans repeatedly block gun laws that could reduce crime, the strategist said.\n\nAnd she has to run the state, keeping Michigan healthy. Should she succeed, then clearly her presidential potential will rise. Should she fail ... well, she may have a much less busy 2028.\n\nFor the sake of the nation\n\nI hope Whitmer is enjoying this moment. I hope she recognizes the enormity of the task before her, and us all, for the good of the state and the nation. Given the options America faces, it is a task she must excel at.\n\nFor me, I would find it quite a lark on January 20, 2029, to say: \u201cSee that woman raising her hand to take the presidential oath? I first saw her when she was a little girl.\u201d I would also be relieved our democracy survived to that moment.\n\nOh yeah \u2014 and I'd also know where in Michigan\u2019s Capitol Whitmer\u2019s portrait would be displayed.\n\nJohn Lindstrom has covered Michigan politics for 50 years.

        "text": "The Biden administration announces rule that will require more background checks on gun buyers\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Thousands more firearms dealers across the United States will have to run background checks on buyers when selling at gun shows or other places outside brick-and-mortar stores, according to a Biden administration rule that will soon go into effect.\n\nREAD MORE: More states move to restrict guns at polling sites to protect workers, voters from threats\n\nThe rule aims to close a loophole that has allowed tens of thousands of guns to be sold every year by unlicensed dealers who don\u2019t perform background checks to ensure the potential buyer is not legally prohibited from having a firearm.\n\nIt\u2019s the administration\u2019s latest effort to combat gun violence. But in a contentious election year, it\u2019s also an effort to show voters \u2014 especially younger ones for whom gun violence deeply resonates \u2014 that the White House is trying to stop the deaths.\n\n\u201cThis is going to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers and felons,\u201d President Joe Biden said in a statement. \u201cAnd my administration is going to continue to do everything we possibly can to save lives. Congress needs to finish the job and pass universal background checks legislation now.\u201d\n\nThe rule, which was finalized this week, makes clear that anyone who sells firearms predominantly to earn a profit must be federally licensed and conduct background checks, regardless of whether they are selling on the internet, at a gun show or at a brick-and-mortar store, Attorney General Merrick Garland told reporters.\n\nBiden has made curtailing gun violence a major part of his administration and reelection campaign, creating the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention overseen by Vice President Kamala Harris. Biden also has urged Congress to ban so-called assault weapons \u2014 something Democrats shied from even just a few years ago.\n\nBut the rule is certain to prompt criticism from gun rights advocates who believe the Democratic president has been unfairly and unlawfully targeting gun owners.\n\nThe Biden administration first proposed the rule in August, after the passage of the most sweeping gun violence bill in decades, a bipartisan compromise in response to the massacre of 19 students and two teachers at a Uvalde, Texas elementary school.\n\nThat law expanded the definition of those who are \u201cengaged in the business\u201d of selling firearms, and are required to become licensed by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and therefore run background checks. The rule, which implements the change in the law, will take effect 30 days after it is published in the Federal Register.\n\nThere are already roughly 80,000 federally licensed firearms dealers. Administration officials believe the new rule will impact more than 20,000 dealers who have gotten away with selling firearms without a license and performing background checks at places like gun shows and over the internet by claiming they aren\u2019t \u201cengaged in the business\u201d of firearm sales.\n\n\u201cThis final rule does not infringe on anyone\u2019s Second Amendment rights, and it will not negatively impact the many law-abiding licensed firearms dealers in our nation,\u201d ATF Director Steve Dettelbach said. \u201cThey are already playing by the rules.\u201d\n\nIt comes a week after the ATF released new data that shows more than 68,000 illegally trafficked firearms in the U.S. came through unlicensed dealers who aren\u2019t required to perform background checks over a five-year period. The ATF report also showed that guns trafficked through unlicensed dealers were used in nearly 370 shootings between 2017 and 2021.\n\nREAD MORE: In Missouri, gun laws take center stage after another shooting\n\nGun control advocates have praised the regulation as a big step toward their goal of universal background checks for gun buyers \u2014 a Democratic priority that has been blocked by Republicans in Congress.\n\n\u201cExpanding background checks and closing the gun seller loophole is a massive victory for safer communities \u2014 and it was made possible thanks to the tireless advocacy of our grassroots movement,\u201d Angela Ferrell-Zabala, executive director of Moms Demand Action, said in an emailed statement.\n\nBut the rule is likely to be challenged in court by gun rights activists, who have previously sued over other ATF rule changes that they argue infringe on gun rights. The National Shooting Sports Foundation, an industry trade group, previously warned of a court challenge if the rule was finalized as written.\n\nBiden administration officials said they are confident the rule \u2014 which drew more than 380,000 public comments \u2014 would withstand legal challenges.",

        "text": "How Russia's disinformation campaign seeps into US views\nOn a near daily basis, Scott Cullinane talks with members of Congress about Russia's war in Ukraine. As a lobbyist for the nonprofit Razom, part of his job is to convince them of Ukraine's need for greater U.S. support to survive.\n\nBut as lawmakers debated a $95 billion package that includes about $60 billion in aid for Ukraine, Cullinane noticed an increase in narratives alleging Ukrainian corruption. What stood out is that these were the same talking points promoted by Russian disinformation.\n\nSo, when The Washington Post published an investigation into an extensive and coordinated Russian campaign to influence U.S. public opinion to deny Ukraine the aid, Cullinane says he was not surprised.\n\n\"This problem has been festering and growing for years,\" he told VOA. \"I believe that Russia's best chance for victory is not on the battlefield, but through information operations targeted on Western capitals, including Washington.\"\n\nThe Post investigation is based on more than 100 documents collected by a European intelligence service.\n\nThe files exposed a Kremlin-linked campaign in which \"political strategists and trolls have written thousands of fabricated news articles, social media posts and comments that promote American isolationism, stir fear over the United States' border security and attempt to amplify U.S. economic and racial tensions,\" the Post reported.\n\nSocial media\n\nOne of the main methods for spreading such disinformation is social media, according to Roman Osadchuk, a researcher at the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab and an expert on propaganda and influence campaigns.\n\n\"The process begins with a Russian publication on a small website or social media account. This is then picked up by a small Russian Telegram channel, which is subsequently shared by a larger channel with more subscribers,\" Osadchuk said.\n\nFrom there, someone will translate the content into English and share it, for example, on X.\n\n\"This is how Russian disinformation can quickly spread within the English-speaking X community,\" Osadchuk said.\n\nIn an article published April 8, The Washington Post cited Microsoft and the social media intelligence company Graphika as saying that some articles created within this operation could have been first published on sites known as doppelgangers.\n\nOsadchuk told VOA that these are deceptive replicas of legitimate media websites. They feature fake articles and are often taken down, only to be replaced by clones with slightly different web addresses.\n\n\"Nobody would know about these sites' existence unless they are promoted on social media platforms. However, as soon as they detect them, social media block them. So, Russians quickly replace banned sites with their clones,\" he said.\n\nWorldwide effect\n\nIn interviews with U.S. media, two influential Republicans said they believe the propaganda has influenced their base and some of their colleagues.\n\n\"It is absolutely true. We see, directly coming from Russia, attempts to mask communications that are anti-Ukraine and pro-Russia messages, some of which we even hear being uttered on the House floor,\" House Intelligence Committee Chair Mike Turner said in an interview with CNN.\n\nIn an interview with the U.S. news website Puck, Michael McCaul, head of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said, \"Russian propaganda has made its way into the U.S., unfortunately, and it's infected a good chunk of my party's base.\"\n\nSerhiy Kudelia, a political scientist at Baylor University, says the Kremlin messaging is effective because it plays on existing fears.\n\nHe says the disinformation seeks to reinforce already held beliefs such as the wastefulness of aid to Ukraine, or fuels existing anger and energizes opposition to sending assistance.\n\n\"When such alignment occurs, it is easier to push through disinformation and invented news stories that would be accepted as credible by a large number of people, including members of Congress, since they reinforce their prior beliefs,\" Kudelia said.\n\n\"Once fabricated stories enter mainstream public debates, they become almost impossible to debunk or separate truth from lies,\" he said.\n\nThe disinformation campaign is similar to ones seen in Europe. Both seek to decrease support for Ukraine, undermine public trust in their institutions and polarize society, says Jakub Kalensk\u00fd, a senior analyst at Helsinki-based European Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats.\n\nKalensk\u00fd, who is deputy director of the center's Hybrid Influence team, believes the Kremlin's disinformation activities have a significant effect on politics worldwide.\n\n\"This is why Russia employs thousands of people for this activity. This is why they spend billions every year, because they see it works,\" he said.\n\nBut Olga Belogolova, director of the Emerging Technologies Initiative at Johns Hopkins University, says that it is hard to know how effective these propaganda efforts are.\n\n\"Russian influence operations are not necessarily always designed to get people to believe anything in particular, but to get them to believe nothing at all,\" she told VOA. Belogolova added that claims of the efforts being successful in swaying opinion \"is not only irresponsible, it's dangerous.\"\n\nCountermeasures needed\n\nLast month, the U.S. Treasury Department issued sanctions on two people and two companies that it says are connected to a \"foreign malign influence campaign.\" They include Moscow-based Social Design Agency, its founder Ilya Gambashidze, Russia-based Group Structura LLC and its CEO Nikolai Tupikin.\n\nThe Social Design Agency and Gambashidze are believed to be involved in the campaign described in the Post article on April 8.\n\nKalensk\u00fd advises governments on countering disinformation and says its success requires countermeasures.\n\nThese include strengthening detection and documentation of Russian disinformation campaigns, increasing awareness and resilience of audiences to the propaganda efforts, and preventing the aggressor from exploiting weaknesses of social media and societies.\n\n\"Finally, we need to impose higher costs on the information aggressors. So far, they are almost unopposed in conducting their aggression,\" Kalensk\u00fd said.\n\nFor Cullinane, the Russian disinformation campaign makes his job harder. He says the debate about the role the U.S. should play in the world appears to be shifting and invoking pre-World War II isolationism.\n\nBut he remains resolute. Part of his work is finding what resonates most with each lawmaker.\n\n\"Some offices focus very much on the human rights situation in Ukraine. Many members are very moved by the plight of religious communities in occupied territories of Ukraine and the persecution they face at the hands of the Russian military,\" Cullinane said. \"Other offices are very intrigued by the military reform and the military innovation brought about by an active war in Ukraine.\"\n\nThe national security spending bill is currently awaiting approval in the House.\n\nThis story originated in VOA's Ukraine Service.",

        "text": "Remarks by President Biden and Prime Minister Kishida Fumio of Japan in Joint Press Conference\nRose Garden\n\n1:23 P.M. EDT\n\nPRESIDENT BIDEN: Please, have a seat.\n\nIt\u2019s an honor to stand here today with the Prime Minister of Japan, President Kishi- \u2014 Prime Minister Kishida.\n\nWhen I became president, I said that the United States would rebuild the muscle of our demo- \u2014 democratic alliances and we\u2019d stand shoulder to shoulder with our allies again, because our alliances are America\u2019s greatest asset. The relationship with Japan is powerful proof of that \u2014 that in investing in our alliance and raising our collective ambitions, we yield remarkable results.\n\nOver the last three years, the partnership between Japan and the United States has been transformed into a truly global partnership. And that\u2019s thanks in no small part to the courageous leadership of Prime Minister Kishida. And I mean that sincerely.\n\nTogether, our countries are taking significant steps to strengthen defense and security cooperation, we\u2019re modernizing command and control structures, and we\u2019re increasing the interoperability and planning of our militaries so they can work together in a seamless and effective way.\n\nThis is the most significant upgrade in our alliance since the end \u2014 since it was first established.\n\nI\u2019m also pleased to announce that for the first time, Japan and the United States and Australia will create a networked system of air, missile, and defense architecture. We\u2019re also looking forward to standing up a trilateral military exercise with Japan and the United Kingdom.\n\nAnd our AUKUS defense partnership with Australia and the United Kingdom is exploring how Japan can join our work in the second pillar, which focuses on advanced capabilities, including AI, autonomous systems. All told, that represents a new benchmark for our military cooperation across a range of capabilities.\n\nOn the economic front, our ties have never been more robust. Japan is the top foreign investor in the United States. Say that again: Japan is the top foreign investor in the United States. And we, the United States, are the top foreign investor in Japan. Nearly 1 million Americans work in Japanese companies here in the United States.\n\nAnd to name just one example, a few months ago, Toyota announced an $8 billion investment in a massive battery production facility in North Carolina, which will inc- \u2014 employ thousands of people. The Prime Minister is going to travel to North Carolina tomorrow to visit that project.\n\nDon\u2019t stay. Don\u2019t stay. We need you back in Japan. (Laughter.) They\u2019ll probably try to keep you.\n\nWe also affirmed the science and education ties between Japan and the United States. Those tries \u2014 ties stretch up to the moon, where two Japanese astronauts will join future American missions, and one will become the first non-American ever to land on the moon.\n\nAnd they reach into the high schools and universities, as well, where the Mineta Ambassadors \u2014 Minetas Program exists, named for our dear friend Norm Mineta. We\u2019re going to invest in new student exchanges, help train the next generation of Japanese and American leaders.\n\nWe also discussed developments in the Middle East, including our shared support for a ceasefire and a hostage deal and urgent efforts to deal with the humanitarian crisis that exists in Gaza.\n\nWe also want to address the Iranian threat to launch a sign- \u2014 they \u2014 they\u2019re threatening to launch a significant attack on Israel. As I told Prime Minister Netanyahu, our commitment to Israel\u2019s security against these threats from Iran and its proxies is ironclad. Let me say it again: ironclad. We\u2019re going to do all we can to protect Israel\u2019s security.\n\nAnd, finally, I want to commend the Prime Minister himself. He is a statesman. Command \u2014 you know, the fact is that you condemned Putin\u2019s invasion of \u2014 brutal invasion of Ukraine when it happened. You pledged more than $12 billion in aid; prioritizing nuclear nonproliferation at the United Nations Security Council; standing strong with the United States as we stand up for freedom of navigation, including in the South China Sea and as we maintain peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits; and taking the brave step of mending ties with the Republic of Korea so we can all stand shoulder to shoulder together.\n\nTomorrow, we will both be joined by another good friend, President Marcos of the Philippines, for a trilateral summit \u2014 the first of its kind.\n\nAnd through it all, our commitment to the defense of Japan under Article 5, including the Sena- \u2014 excuse me \u2014 Senkaku Islands, is unwavering.\n\nMr. Prime Minister, through our partnership, we have strengthened this alliance. We have expanded our work together. We have raised our shared ambitions. And now, the U.S.-Japan alliance is a beacon to the entire world.\n\nThere\u2019s no limit to what our countries can and our people can do together.\n\nSo, thank you for your partnership, your leadership, and your friendship.\n\nAnd now, over to you, Mr. Prime Minister.\n\nPRIME MINISTER KISHIDA: Thank you, Joe.\n\n(As interpreted.) President Biden and I have met and talked countless times and confirmed our shared notion that we are at crucial crossroads and that Japan-U.S. partnership is immensely important.\n\nThe international community stands at a historical turning point. In order for Japan, the U.S., the Indo-Pacific region, and, for that matter, the whole world to enjoy peace, stability, and prosperity lasting into the future, we must resolutely defend and further solidify a free and open international order based on the rule of law.\n\nAnd again, today, I told the President that now is the time to demonstrate the true values that Japan and the United States can offer as global partners, that we must together fulfill our responsibilities to create a world where human dignity is upheld and that Japan will always stand firm with the United States.\n\nI explained that, based on our national security strategy, Japan is determined to strengthen our defense force through position of counterstrike capabilities, increase our defense budget and other initiatives, and was reassured by President Biden of his strong support for such efforts.\n\nIn such context, we confirmed again the urgency to further bolster the deterrence and response capabilities of our alliance and concurred on reinforcing our security and defense cooperation to increase interoperability between the U.S. forces and our self-defense forces, including the improvement of our respective command-and-control frameworks.\n\nWe will be discussing the specifics as we plan for the next Japan-U.S. two-plus-two.\n\nThe President and I went on to discuss various specific challenges faced by the international community.\n\nFirst, we confirmed that unilateral attempts to change status quo by force or coercion is absolutely unacceptable, wherever it may be, and that we will continue to respond resolutely against such action through cooperation with allies and likeminded nations.\n\nFrom such perspective, we agreed that our two countries will continue to respond to challenges concerning China through close coordination. At the same time, we confirmed the importance of continuing our dialogue with China and cooperating with China on common challenges.\n\nWe also underscored the importance of peace and stability in the Taiwan Straits and confirmed our position to encourage peaceful resolution of the Cross-Straits issue.\n\nThe situation in North Korea, including nuclear and missiles development, was brought up as well. We welcomed the progress seen in many areas of cooperation based on the outcome of the Japan-U.S.-ROK summit last August and concurred to coordinate even more closely as we face serious concerns under the current state of affairs.\n\nPresident Biden once again demonstrated his strong support towards the immediate resolution of the abduction issue.\n\nWe reaffirmed the importance of realizing a free and open Indo-Pacific based on the rule of law and concurred to maintain close collaboration through various opportunities, including the Japan-U.S.-Philippines summit, which is planned for tomorrow.\n\nRegarding Russia\u2019s aggression of Ukraine, based on\n\na recognition that Ukraine today may be East Asia tomorrow \u2014 taking the issue as our own problem for Japan, I expressed our resolution to continue with stringent sanctions against Russia and strong support for Ukraine. And we concurred to maintain close partnership with likeminded countries.\n\nOn the situation in the Middle East, I expressed my respect for the efforts of President Biden towards the release of the hostages, improvement of the humanitarian situation, and for calming down the situation. I then explained how Japan is continuing diplomatic efforts to improve the humanitarian situation and to realize a sustainable ceasefire\n\nand agreed to continue close cooperation towards the improvement of the situation, the realization of a two-state solution, and the stabilization of the region.\n\nRegarding the economy, we firstly concurred that for both of us to lead the global economic growth together, the promotion of investment in both directions is important. I explained how Japanese businesses are making a significant contribution to the U.S. economy by the investment and the creation of jobs, to which President Biden agreed.\n\nIn order to maintain and strengthen the competitive edge in the area of advanced technologies and to respond appropriately to issues such as economic coercion, non-market policies and practices, and excess capacities and to overcome the vulnerability of the supply chains and to lead a sustainable and inclusive economic growth, we affirmed that the collaboration of Japan and the United States is indispensable.\n\nIn addition, we concurred to advance our cooperation in the areas such as decarbonization, AI, and start-ups.\n\nThere was a huge achievement also in the area of space. In the first half of the 1960s, when I was in the United States, it was the dawn of space development in the United States. I am one of all those who were so excited in the U.S. by the spectacular challenge in space.\n\nThe implementing arrangement has been signed on this occasion and the provision of the lunar rover by Japan and the allocation of two astronaut flight opportunities to the lunar surface to Japan were confirmed. Under the Artemis program, I welcome the lunar landing by a Japanese astronaut as the first non-U.S. astronaut.\n\nWe also discussed the efforts towards a world without nuclear weapons. We affirmed the realistic and practical endeavors of nuclear disarmament, including the issuance of the G7 Leaders\u2019 Hiroshima Vision last year. And I welcomed the participation of the United States in the FMCT Friends, which was launched by my initiative.\n\nLastly, in order to further strengthen the people-to-people bond, which is the cornerstone of our unwavering Japan-U.S. relationship, we affirmed to further promote people-to-people exchanges.\n\nAs the outcome of our meeting today, we will issue the joint statement titled \u201cThe Global Partners for the Future.\u201d This is the expression of the determination of Japan and the United States to maintain and strengthen a free and open international order based on the rule of law that underpins the peace, stability, and prosperity of the international community and states the guiding principles.\n\nWith our partnership, we will defend the future of Japan and the United States, the Indo-Pacific, and the world and make that future all the more prosperous.\n\nPRESIDENT BIDEN: Thank you. Now we\u2019ll take a few questions.\n\nJordan Fabian of Bloomberg.\n\nQ Thank you, Mr. President. Last month, you predicted the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates thanks to falling inflation. But today, data showed that inflation rose more than expected for the third straight month. So, how concerned are you about the fight against inflation stalling? And do you stand by your prediction for a rate cut?\n\nPRESIDENT BIDEN: Well, I do stand by my prediction that before the year is out there will a rate cut. This may delay it a month or so. I\u2019m not sure of that. I don\u2019t \u2014 we don\u2019t know what the Fed is going to do for certain.\n\nBut, look, we have dramatically reduced inflation from 9 percent down to close to 3 percent. We\u2019re in a situation where we\u2019re better situated than we were when we took office where we \u2014 inflation was skyrocketing. And we have a plan to deal with it, whereas the opposition \u2014 my opposition talks about two things. They just want to cut taxes for the wealthy and raise taxes on other people.\n\nAnd so, I think they\u2019re \u2014 they have no plan. Our plan is one I think is still sustainable.\n\nQ Mr. Prime Minister, you said that the Nippon Steel acquisition of U.S. Steel is a private matter. But I\u2019m wondering: Did you discuss the matter today with President Biden? And do you believe that politics are influencing President Biden\u2019s decision to oppose the deal?\n\nAnd I wouldn\u2019t mind, Mr. President, if you answer that one too.\n\nPRIME MINISTER KISHIDA: (As interpreted.) On the issue that you have raised, we understand that discussions are underway between the parties. We hope these discussions will unfold in directions that would be positive for both sides.\n\nJapan believes that appropriate procedures based on law is being implemented by the U.S. government. Japan is the largest investor to the United States. Japanese businesses employ close to 1 million workers in the United States. And investment from Japan to the U.S. can only increase upwards in the months and years to come.\n\nAnd we wish to cement this win-win relationship. Thank you.\n\nPRESIDENT BIDEN: I stand by my commitment to American workers. I ca- \u2014 a man of my word, I\u2019m going to keep it. And with regard to that, I stand by our commitment to our alliance. This is exactly what we\u2019re doing \u2014 a strong alliance as well.\n\nQ Nakakuki of Kyodo News. My question is to both Prime Minister Kishida and President Biden. At the summit, you confirmed your strong objections against unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force or coercion by China and agreed on reinforcing response capabilities.\n\nUnder current circumstances, should Japan and the United States bolster defense capabilities? China may become more preoccupied in military expansion and intensify its coercive behavior. That is the risk of (inaudible). In order to avoid divide and expa- \u2014 avoid the divide, how should Japan and U.S. respond?\n\nPRIME MINISTER KISHIDA: (As interpreted.) Let me then take that question first. At this summit, we confirmed that the United States and Japan will resolutely defend and bolster a free and open international order based on the rule of law and that Japan and the United States, as global partners, shall work together for that purpose.\n\nOn challenges concerning China, including the point you raised on objecting to unilateral attempts to change status quo by force or coercion, we concurred that Japan and the United States as global partners shall work in close coordination.\n\nAnd also, as I said previously, we will continue our dialogue with China and we will cooperate with China in tackling common challenges. And the President and I confirmed the importance of such dialogue as well.\n\nBased on the solid trust with our ally, the United States, we will continue to call on China to fulfill its responsibilities as a major power.\n\nJapan\u2019s policy, which I have consistently embraced, is to comprehensively promote the mutual strategic relationship we have with China and establish a constructive and stable Japan-China relationship through efforts by both sides. That has been my consistent position that I have upheld. We will continue to seek close communication with China at all levels.\n\nThat\u2019s it for me.\n\nPRESIDENT BIDEN: You know, first of all, we keep improving our lines of communications with one another \u2014 and that\u2019s the United States and China. We \u2014 I\u2019ve met \u2014 I\u2019ve recently spoken at length with President Xi. And we\u2019ve agreed that we would, number one, have personal contact with one another whenever we want to discuss to anything so there\u2019d be no \u2014 nothing lipped \u2014 nothing slips between, as they say \u2014 between the cup and the lip, so we know exactly what the other team is thinking. Number one.\n\nAnd so, we had a long discussion last \u2014 now almost \u2014 I guess almost two weeks ago now. And \u2014 the best way to reduce the chances of miscalculation and misunderstanding. That\u2019s number one.\n\nNumber two, in our alliance we have with Japan \u2014 is a purely defensive in nature. It\u2019s a defensive alliance. And the things we discussed today improve our cooperation and are \u2014 and are purely about defense and readiness. It\u2019s not aimed at any one nation or a threat to the region. And it \u2014 it doesn\u2019t have anything to do with conflict. And so, this is about restoring stability in the region. And I think we have a chance of doing that.\n\nOkay. Third que- \u2014 the next question. Who \u2014 who do I call on next? Hang on a second. I got my list here. Hang on. I apologize.\n\nAurelia of AFP.\n\nQ Thank you. My first question would go to both of you, Mr. President and Mr. Prime Minister. Is there a path for Japan to become a full member of AUKUS?\n\nAnd I would have a second question for you, Mr. President. You\u2019re now saying that Benjamin Netanyahu is making a mistake in Gaza. What are you willing to do to make him change his strategy? And would you consider conditioning military aid to Israel? Thank you.\n\nPRIME MINISTER KISHIDA: (As interpreted.) Thank you. Your question about AUKUS, I will respond. Our country \u2014 we want to contribute to the peace and stability of the region. And therefore, we have consistently supported AUKUS.\n\nHaving said that, the participants of AUKUS \u2014 U.S., UK, Australia \u2014 with such countries\u2019 bi- \u2014 bilateral relationship or in multilateral occasions, we have established various relationships. But for Japan, to have a direct cooperation with AUKUS, nothing has been decided at this moment.\n\nGoing forward with U.S., UK, or with Australia \u2014 with such countries, in bilateral or multilateral frameworks, we will continue our cooperation so that they will continue to be considered.\n\nAt the moment, about the relationship between Japan and AUKUS, that\u2019s it.\n\nPRESIDENT BIDEN: With regard to my discussions with Bibi Netanyahu \u2014 Prime Minister Netanyahu, as well as our relationship with Israel, I have been very blunt and straightforward with the Prime Minister, as well as his War Cabinet, as well as the Cabinet.\n\nAnd the fact of the matter is that Bibi and I had a long discussion. He agreed to do several things that related to, number one, getting more aid \u2014 both food and medicine \u2014 into Gaza and reducing significantly the attempts \u2014 the civilian casualties in any action taken in the region.\n\nAnd thus far \u2014 and we \u2014 and it\u2019s tied to the hostages. There are a number of hostages that are being held by a \u2014 by the \u2014 Hamas. And just yesterday, we were meeting with the Vice President and our National Security Advisor before that, and they \u2014 and there are American hostages as well. And they know how committed we are \u2014 the whole team \u2014 to getting their loved ones home, and we\u2019re not going to stop until we do.\n\nThe new proposal on the table \u2014 Bill Burns led the effort to \u2014 for us, and we\u2019re grateful for his work \u2014 there\u2019s a now \u2014 up to Hamas. They need to move on the proposal that\u2019s been made. And as I said, it would get these hostages home where they belong but also bring back a six-week cea- \u2014 ceasefire that we need now.\n\nAnd the fact is that we\u2019re \u2014 they\u2019re getting in somewhere, in the last three days, over a hundred trucks. It\u2019s not enough. But it needs to be \u2014 be more, and there\u2019s one more opening that has to take place in the north.\n\nSo, we\u2019ll see what he does in terms of meeting the commitments he made to me.\n\nOkay \u2014\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: This will be the last reporter.\n\nPRIME MINISTER KISHIDA: (As interpreted.) Mr. Shimizu, please.\n\nQ (As interpreted.) Thank you. Shimizu of NHK. I ask the question to both of you.\n\nAs Prime Minister Kishida mentioned, the abduction issue of North Korea, I believe, was discussed. Prime Minister, you have expressed your wish to have a direct engagement with Kim Jong Un. But they say that abduction is already result, which means that they are refusing. During the meeting, what did you tell President Biden about the outlook of a summit? And what engagement did you ask President Biden?\n\nPresident Biden, my question: What did you hear from Prime Minister Kishida? And what is your observation and feeling, your President, with the nuclear missile issues? What is your position? Do you support the summit between Japan and North Korea? Thank you.\n\nPRIME MINISTER KISHIDA: (As interpreted.) First of all, if I may start, regarding my summit meeting with President Biden about North Korea, including the missile and nuclear issues we have discussed, and regarding the increasingly worrying situation, we have agreed to continue a close coordination.\n\nAnd on top of that, we concurred that the window of a discussion with North Korea is open. And we discussed that Japan, U.S. \u2014 Japan, U.S., and ROK will continue to work closely together.\n\nI also asked for the continued understanding and cooperation for the immediate resolution of the abduction issue. And President Biden once again gave myself a very strong assurance regarding the recent announcement by North Korea.\n\nI will refrain from commenting on each and every announcement by North Korea. But as I have been mentioning repeatedly, based on the perspective that the establishment of a meaningful relationship between Japan and North Korea is in the interest of both Japan and North Korea and that it could be hugely beneficial to the peace and stability of the region, my policy is to aim for a summit meeting with North Korea to resolve various issues and will advise high-level consultation directly under my instruction. And that remains unchanged.\n\n\n\nThat is my response.\n\nPRESIDENT BIDEN: We did discuss this issue. We both agreed the DPRK must \u2014 must also address the serious human rights and humanitarian concerns of the international community, including the immediate resolution of the abduction issue.\n\nBut, you know, the Prime Minister has just spoken to the potential of what his plans may mean. But welcome \u2014 I welcome the opportunity \u2014 we welcome the opportunity of our allies to initiate dialogue with the Democratic Republic of Korea.\n\nAs I\u2019ve said many times, we\u2019re open to dialogue ourselves at any time wi- \u2014 but without preconditions from the DPRK.\n\n\n\nSo, I have faith in the \u2014 in the \u2014 Japan. I have faith in the Prime Minister. And I think his seeking a dialogue with them is a good thing. It\u2019s a positive thing.\n\nThank you.\n\nQ Sir, on the issue of abortion \u2014\n\nQ What will you do if Israel invades Rafah?\n\nQ On the issue of abortion, sir, what do you say to the people of Arizona?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: This concludes the press conference. Thanks, everybody.\n\nQ Mr. President, are the American hostages alive?\n\nQ What will you do if Israel invades Rafah?\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\nPRESIDENT BIDEN: Why doesn\u2019t everybody holler at once?\n\nQ I\u2019ll ask you briefly. On the issue of abortion, sir, respectfully, what do you say to the people of Arizona right now who are witnessing a law go in place that dates back to the Civil War era?\n\nPRESIDENT BIDEN: Elect me. I\u2019m in the 20 \u2014 it\u2019s the 20th century \u2014 21st century, not back then. They weren\u2019t even a state. I find \u2014\n\nQ Sir, how does the \u2014\n\nPRESIDENT BIDEN: I \u2014\n\nQ What will you do if Israel invades Rafah?\n\nQ Mr. President, how does the war in Ukraine come to an end?\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\nPRESIDENT BIDEN: Thank you. Thank you all very much. Thank you.\n\nQ Sir, how does the \u2014\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\nQ Can you elaborate on what mistake Netanyahu is making, sir?\n\n\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Thanks, everybody.\n\nQ How does the war in Ukraine come to an end, sir?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: This concludes the press conference.\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\nPRESIDENT BIDEN: By the House \u2014 by the Hou- \u2014 the war in Ukraine comes to an end by the House Leader allowing a vote. There\u2019s overwhelming support for Ukraine among the majority of Democrats and Republicans. There should be a vote now.\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\nQ Are the American hostages alive?\n\nQ Will you reconsider the LNG export ban, sir?\n\nPRESIDENT BIDEN: There is no ban to Japan.\n\n1:53 P.M. EDT",

Sign up for our free newsletters.\n\nHARRISBURG \u2014 Millions of voters are expected to cast ballots during Pennsylvania\u2019s April 23 primary, choosing candidates to represent the Democratic and Republican parties in November.\n\nMore than 1 million registered voters will also be excluded from that process.\n\nPennsylvania is one of 10 states with a closed primary system. That means only voters who are registered to a major party may participate in its primary election.\n\nMore than 1.3 million people in Pennsylvania are registered without a political affiliation or with a third party. Such voters can still participate in statewide referenda, local ballot initiatives, and special elections that coincide with the primaries.\n\nGood-government advocates and lawmakers from across the political spectrum want to change this system, arguing that the closed primary system disenfranchises independent and third-party voters.\n\n\u00bb NEW EVENT: Join Spotlight PA at 6 p.m. April 29 for a virtual interview with Nick Troiano, author of The Primary Solution, a new book on how partisan primaries are fueling partisanship and what can be done about it. This is a member-only event, but you can join by making a gift to Spotlight PA now. Currently a member? Email us to RSVP for free.\n\nThey also say that if the state\u2019s primaries were open, unaffiliated voters would serve as a mitigating force that could dilute support for extremist candidates and decrease polarization.\n\nPennsylvania\u2019s five most recent governors signed an open letter last spring that voiced support for the change, writing that \u201cour political system has changed over the past two decades\u201d and now requires the state to adjust its approach.\n\n\u201cPrimary elections are often decided by a few more extreme voters. Candidates elected by those more extreme voters don\u2019t have as much incentive to engage in the compromise and give and take that is so essential to effective governing. Adding independent voters to the primary mix will help,\u201d the governors wrote.\n\nThe good-government group Committee of Seventy has an initiative, Ballot PA, dedicated to advocating for open primaries. David Thornburgh, who chairs the initiative and is the son of late Republican Gov. Dick Thornburgh, said he sees the upcoming election as a missed opportunity.\n\n\u201cThe bad news is here comes another primary with 1.2 million voters locked out,\u201d Thornburgh said. \u201cThe good news is that there continue to be windows of opportunity and momentum.\u201d\n\nThere have been pushes in the legislature to open Pennsylvania primaries over the past few decades, but none have gotten very far.\n\nIn 2019, the GOP-controlled state Senate voted 42-8 for a bill that would allow independents to participate in either the Democratic or Republican primary election. The legislation, sponsored by then-President Pro Tempore Joe Scarnati (R., Jefferson), was not considered by the state House.\n\nAt the time, the lower chamber was controlled by Republicans. After Democrats won control of the state House in 2022, supporters of open primaries expressed hope that the new majority would prioritize such a measure.\n\nSo far, that hasn\u2019t happened.\n\nThe chamber\u2019s State Government Committee passed two bills on the subject last fall \u2014 one sponsored by a Democrat, one by a Republican. Only Democrats on the panel voted in favor of the bills.\n\nBoth bills would allow unaffiliated voters to choose which major party primary to participate in. The legislation introduced by state Rep. Marla Brown (R., Lawrence) goes a step further and would allow third-party voters to also make that choice.\n\nState House leadership hasn\u2019t called up either measure for a vote, and Majority Leader Matt Bradford (D., Montgomery) has not come out in support or against the bills.\n\nA spokesperson for the state House Democratic caucus said it is \u201cstill reviewing the bill.\u201d\n\nOpen primary supporters also face major hurdles in the state Senate\n\nThe chair of the upper chamber\u2019s State Government Committee, state Sen. Cris Dush (R., Centre), previously told Spotlight PA that he is opposed to opening the state\u2019s primaries. Dush controls which bills are considered by the committee, through which any open primary legislation would need to pass.\n\nIf a bill did advance out of the committee, it would still need to be called up for a floor vote by Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R., Indiana). A spokesperson for the state Senate Republican caucus said that discussions on open primaries are \u201congoing\u201d but its focus is on bills that would \u201crestore voter confidence in our electoral focus.\u201d\n\nDespite the lack of legislative action, Thornburgh is hopeful that this upcoming election season will further highlight the need to open primaries, as lawmakers in both parties condemn extremism.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a political season now and that will be brutal,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to open up that conversation to make sure that includes independents.\u201d\n\nBEFORE YOU GO\u2026 If you learned something from this article, pay it forward and contribute to Spotlight PA at spotlightpa.org/donate.

Sorry, something went wrong. Please try again.\n\nThis year, he\u2019s not drawn to alternatives like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. or Cornel West. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll write in Abe Lincoln this year. Sorry to my dad, but a new name to write in would be fun,\u201d he said.\n\nHe recalls seeking to convince his classmates in an eighth-grade mock election that they should support Mitt Romney, but his chagrin with the Republican Party\u2019s presidential nominee tracked with the ascension of Donald Trump.\n\nIn a year when both major party presidential candidates are viewed unfavorably by a quarter of Americans, many find themselves less excited about the two options at the top of the ticket. But, like Richert, that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re ready to go for third-party options.\n\nThe third-party candidates running in 2024 span the ideological spectrum, from independents Kennedy and Princeton University professor Cornel West to Green Party candidate Jill Stein. Then there are the more obscure party or candidate options\u2014the Prohibition Party, Andrew Yang\u2019s Forward Party, Maryland politician Jason Palmer, and that man in Texas who changed his name to \u201cLiterally Anybody Else.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the most promising third-party attempt, the No Labels Party, drew in funding with its centrist messaging, but its efforts failed before Election Day. The party ended its presidential campaign last week after being unable to find \u201ccandidates with a credible path to winning.\u201d\n\nRFK Jr. has emerged as the top third-party candidate this race, polling just under 12 percent, higher than any third-party candidate since businessman Ross Perot in 1992. The son of former attorney general and senator Robert F. Kennedy, his popularity is aided by his high-profile last name.\n\nAfter failing to make headway in the Democratic primary, Kennedy opted to run as an independent. He is only on the ballot in half a dozen states, but his campaign is on a signature-collection blitz and has vowed to get on the ballots of all 50 states this fall.\n\nKennedy has said his campaign is \u201ca spoiler for President Biden and President Trump.\u201d\n\nIt remains to be seen which major party candidate would be hurt more if Kennedy\u2019s strong polling translates into votes come November. But both parties are taking the threat seriously, with the Democratic National Committee and the Republican National Committee (and Trump himself, for that matter) going after the independent candidate.\n\n\u201cI suspect at least some of the support for RFK Jr. is really just a potholder for the anger and dissatisfaction with Donald Trump and Joe Biden,\u201d said Mark Caleb Smith, a political scientist at Cedarville University in Ohio.\n\nKennedy is Catholic and at times has appealed to his faith in interviews and on social media. His policies span the ideological and political spectrum, and he\u2019s best known for his environmental activism.\n\nHe\u2019s also antiestablishment and was a vocal critic of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns and vaccine mandates, and he has criticized the impact that had on the right to religious assembly. He\u2019s pro-choice and believes that the Dobbs v. Jackson decision overturning a national right to abortion was a mistake.\n\nFor evangelicals seeking candidates who reflect their values and beliefs more closely than either of the major parties, some have backed indepedent candidates or found new political homes in lesser-known third parties.\n\nDale Huntington, a 41-year-old pastor of City Life Church in San Diego, California, landed on the American Solidarity Party (ASP), a small but growing Christian party founded in 2011. Its platform is largely shaped by social teaching from Catholic thought.\n\nHe found out about the group because of evangelical author and professor Karen Swallow Prior, who is a member of ASP\u2019s advisory board.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t support the death penalty or abortion. I am largely anti-war and anti-police brutality,\u201d Huntington said. \u201cI would say voting for a third party is choosing to acknowledge the system as it is has become broken.\u201d\n\nHuntington used to alternate between Republican and Democrat tickets but ultimately felt like neither was holistically pro-life.\n\nIn 2020, the American Solidarity Party ran its first evangelical presidential nominee\u2014retired teacher and former Evangelical Free Church elder Brian Carroll (whom CT reported on at the time).\n\nCarroll had long had his doubts about the Republican Party\u2019s level of commitment to pro-life policies. But it was the GOP\u2019s hardening on immigration, education, and other issues in 2016 that made him defect entirely.\n\nAfter that, he went looking for other options. When he stumbled upon the ASP, he said, \u201c[I] read the platform once and I said, \u2018Yes, this is it.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhen Carroll ran, the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns made campaigning difficult. It also was a challenge for volunteers to garner signatures during lockdowns. Despite that, they had some success. Last presidential election, the American Solidarity Party made it onto the ballots of 8 states\u2014and received write-in votes in 31 states. They drew over 42,000 votes in total.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d love to double the number,\u201d Marcos Lopez, party chair, told CT.\n\nBallot access is a huge challenge, he added, for a party facing limited financial resources, a small pool of volunteers, and stringent state requirements to get on the ballot.\n\nDespite challenges, interest in the group is growing. There was a surge in volunteer signups online after Super Tuesday last month, when it became clear that November would bring a Donald Trump and Joe Biden rematch.\n\nParty members acknowledge that winning is not in the cards, but they believe a third option allows Americans who reject the \u201clesser of two evils\u201d argument to vote in a way that respects their conscience and sends a message.\n\n\u201cWhether you\u2019re Catholic, whether you\u2019re Baptist, whether you\u2019re a nondenominational evangelical, whether you\u2019re Orthodox\u2014anyone who is serious about their faith, and anyone who\u2019s serious about wanting to see these policies grounded in advancing the common good\u2014anyone who wants to see those things happen is willing to come to the table,\u201d Lopez said.\n\nThe issue of abortion has been a particular draw for religious individuals, Lopez said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at an issue in November where neither [Republican nor Democrat] candidate really fits the label of pro-life. \u2026 In many states we\u2019re going to be the only pro-life option people can vote for, and that\u2019s a very sad reality. But it is a reality, and that makes our work even more important.\u201d\n\nAbortion can be a deal breaker for some evangelicals when it comes to crossing the aisle to support Biden. While the Trump campaign has highlighted pro-life wins (such as the Dobbs decision), Trump has presented a softer approach to the issue in recent days.\n\nOn Monday, he said it should be left to the states to carve out individual abortion policies. \u201cAt the end of the day, this is all about the will of the people. You must follow your heart, or in many cases, your religion or your faith,\u201d he said in a video statement.\n\nOn Thursday, he said in response to a reporter that he would not sign a federal abortion ban.\n\nThis year, Peter Sonski, a former editor for the National Catholic Register, is the American Solidarity Party candidate. Sonski, 61, has been a member of both the Democratic and Republican parties throughout his life but was frustrated that neither fully matched his religious convictions.\n\n\u201cWe want to protect human life, give it all the protections of the law,\u201d Sonski said of his party. \u201cAt the same time, we recognize there are many more things that the government can do\u2014and society in general can do\u2014for women who have needs in pregnancy \u2026 health care, expanded child tax credits, better housing options; all of these are factors.\u201d\n\nThe father of nine and grandfather of six brings the experience of an elected official to the role: He serves as a school district member for the board of education for Connecticut\u2019s 17th District. He tapped Lauren Onak, a 35-year-old stay-at-home mother and community organizer, as his vice president candidate.\n\nOnak was raised a Democrat but defected to the Republican Party due to her interest in the pro-life movement. But a number of things caused her to break with the party, culminating in the birth of a daughter with a rare genetic syndrome and seeing how the social safety net of a \u201cblue state\u201d like Massachusetts benefited her daughter\u2019s special needs.\n\nIt was \u201cseeing the importance for this social safety net very much in action and having to push back against this mindset of, if you need help from the government, it makes you somehow weak,\u201d she said.\n\nShe joined the American Solidarity Party in 2021, following the chaos of the COVID-19 pandemic and social unrest, believing it offered a \u201creasonable voice in politics.\u201d At 35, she\u2019s just old enough to join the presidential ticket. She believes her candidacy is important for other disillusioned millennials.\n\nOne of those millennials is Bob Stevenson, a 40-year-old pastor in Chicago who found himself frustrated with having to choose which convictions to prioritize when he went to the ballot box.\n\nHe felt like he had to pick between unborn babies or immigrants and people in poverty.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like, that\u2019s a red thing or that\u2019s a blue thing. And I\u2019m like, that\u2019s a Christian thing,\u201d Stevenson told CT. Although he said no party is perfect, he found the American Solidarity Party \u201cstraddles those concerns in a way that partisan politics don\u2019t. So that was deeply attractive to me.\u201d\n\nThird parties have a tough uphill battle, largely due to the two-party structure that dominates American politics.\n\n\u201cWe do have an abundance of third parties,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThey just can\u2019t seem to rise to the point where they have a significant impact. Most of that is because the two major parties absorb them.\u201d\n\nBut third parties still have an effect: Smith gave the example of the Green Party elevating climate and environmental issues, which resulted in Democrats incorporating more of those concerns into their platform; or Republicans (at least in days past) leaning more libertarian and drawing voters away from the Libertarian Party. Other examples include the abolition of slavery and universal health care.\n\nSmith says that rather than third parties or candidates becoming competitive, major changes in American politics usually happen within the vehicle of a major party. Or, at times, a major party falls by the wayside only to be replaced, such as the Whigs, who were replaced by Republicans.\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t that a third party rises up and it\u2019s competitive. It\u2019s one of the two major parties just implodes, and then this party steps forward and kind of picks up the pieces and you see something else emerge,\u201d Smith said.\n\nWhile the framework of Republican and Democratic parties has been in place since 1856, Smith said dissatisfaction with the options is at a \u201cpretty significant and historical\u201d level: \u201cWe keep seeing that in primary results on both sides of the aisle\u2014even though the contest has been settled for a long time\u2014that both candidates are getting pretty significant pushback.\u201d\n\nFormer South Carolina governor Nikki Haley continues to garner primary votes, despite dropping out after Super Tuesday\u2019s primaries confirmed she had no viable path to the Republican nomination for president. On the Democratic side, progressives organized to lodge protest votes to send a message to Biden in Michigan\u2019s Democratic primary, racking up more than 100,000 \u201cuncommitted\u201d votes.\n\nBut that may not translate to large numbers of Americans choosing to send a statement by voting outside the major parties on November 5.\n\nAmericans unhappy with their options may be more likely to tune politics out and sit elections out entirely. Those who head to the ballot box despite frustration and alienation from both major parties, Smith noted, \u201care a fairly small group of people.\u201d\n\nChristians who vote third party are aware that they\u2019re a minority. But they think there are some things more important than making a pragmatic choice. Stevenson said when friends or family found out he planned to vote third party, they looked at him like he had his \u201chead screwed on backwards.\u201d\n\nBut he believes that \u201cit\u2019s a way for us to bear witness in the United States where Christians have historically, over the past couple of decades, aligned themselves with a political party and have shown themselves to be political opportunists and pragmatics.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s an opportunity for us to offer a different way. We can be like, actually the way of Jesus doesn\u2019t look like an elephant or a donkey.\u201d\n\nCorrection: Brian Carroll had served as an elder in the Evangelical Free Church, not the Evangelical Covenant Church.",

        "text": "How MAGA Took Back Murdochland\nJust minutes before the White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner was set to get underway in April 2023, New York Post Editor-in-Chief Keith Poole and star columnist Miranda Devine were on a mission to find an extra seat. Inside the Washington Hilton hotel, the pair had a very special guest that they needed to accommodate and their table was oversubscribed. After some musical chairs among staffers, Vivek Ramaswamy spent much of the evening talking with Poole, a Brit feted as a \u201cboy wonder\u201d in Murdoch circles.\n\nPoole, who like all Murdoch editors has a direct line to \u201cthe boss,\u201d had already created waves in his handling of Donald Trump\u2019s 2024 presidential announcement. \u201cBeen There, Don That\u201d was the headline that was tucked away on page 26 of the Nov. 22, 2022 edition of the Post. But it was the teaser at the bottom of the front page that went viral. \u201cFlorida man makes announcement.\u201d\n\nSoon, Poole would be in a pickle. It was nearly six months on from his newspaper\u2019s trolling of Trump and he, like all Murdoch editors, was trying to identify a viable competitor to Trump. In November 2022, the paper had declared Ron DeSantis \u201cDeFuture.\u201d By May 2023, the paper doubled down with \u201cOff and Ronning: DeSantis pitches \u2018Great American Comeback,\u2019\u201d but insiders now acknowledge that what followed was inevitable. By January of this year, the paper ran a front-page \u201cDon It Again\u201d after Trump won the New Hampshire primary, and by March 5 it was declaring, \u201cIt\u2019s a Don Deal.\u201d In an even more blunt turn as campaigning for the general election got underway, the March 29 issue of the paper led with a split screen of Trump and Joe Biden and headlined it: \u201cGive and Take \u2014 Trump attends wake for killed hero NYPD cop\u2026as 3 Dem presidents shut down city for glitzy $25M fundraiser.\u201d\n\nIf it all feels familiar for the Post, it didn\u2019t have to be that way. In 2020, Rupert Murdoch was angered that Trump was going to lose what he thought was a winnable election. When Fox called the results for a Biden Arizona win, the audience was outraged. The mogul, shocked by the backlash, told confidants he was concerned viewers would decamp for alternatives such as Newsmax and OAN.\n\nNow, four years later, those close to Trump tell The Hollywood Reporter the ex-president is keen to establish more of a relationship with Murdoch\u2019s eldest son and Fox Corp. CEO Lachlan, 52. The two first met at a state dinner for Scott Morrison, then Australia\u2019s prime minister, at the White House in 2019. \u201cThe leadership baton has passed, and there\u2019s recognition that [Trump] does not have the history or depth of relationship with Lachlan that he\u2019s always been able to count on with Rupert,\u201d says a person familiar with the matter. Reps for Trump, Murdoch and Fox declined to comment.\n\nLike the Post, Fox News has been subject to contortions over the former president. After essentially banning Trump from going live on its airwaves for two years, it welcomed the president back for a town hall event in January. Before that, Trump\u2019s interviews were pretaped \u2014 an insurance mechanism after the network was forced to pay out almost $800 million to settle the Dominion lawsuit, which had scarred the Murdochs\u2019 prized asset. (During testimony for the case, the elder Murdoch, now 93, was asked directly if he believed Trump\u2019s claims that he won by \u201cmillions of votes that were shifted by Dominion software\u201d in 2020. \u201cNo, I\u2019ve never believed that,\u201d Murdoch replied. In an email disclosed in discovery, Murdoch sent a longtime lieutenant, Col Allan, who edited the Post, his take on Rudy Giuliani. \u201cJust saw Rudy ranting. Terrible influence on Donald,\u201d Murdoch wrote, days after the Nov. 3 presidential election.)\n\nFor a long time after the settlement, Fox had pushed alternatives to Trump. DeSantis. Ramaswamy. Nikki Haley. But around Christmas last year it became clear Trump would be making a triumphant return.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t escape a feeling that it\u2019s with great reluctance on the part of Lachlan and Rupert that Fox News finds itself with no alternative but to support Trump,\u201d Lachlan\u2019s biographer Paddy Manning, author of The Successor, says from Adelaide, Australia, where Rupert Murdoch got his start in newspapers. \u201cLachlan has got to put his personal politics and preferences to one side and focus on the business, which is entirely premised on providing a right-leaning political diet to a base that is increasingly radicalized.\u201d\n\nWith Rupert Murdoch moving last year into a new role as chairman emeritus of both Fox Corp. and News Corp. and now planning his fifth wedding, all eyes will be on his son, who is based in Sydney with his wife and children. \u201cI think the reality is Lachlan is calling the shots, but he is also never going to stop his father from emailing or speaking to anyone in the company that he built,\u201d Manning says. \u201cLachlan\u2019s personal politics, worldview and preference for this coming election are beside the point. What matters is what goes to air and whether he supports it, endorses it or otherwise, the impact is the same.\u201d\n\nOf course, since its launch in 1996, Fox News has always been programmed for an audience that bought into the idea of countering the \u201cmainstream media.\u201d Late founder Roger Ailes (and current CEO Suzanne Scott) was said to have a sixth sense for what their viewers want. But Fox\u2019s strength isn\u2019t making a unilateral decision about what they are going to put on; it\u2019s audience strategy. Now it\u2019s obvious: The audience wants Trump. And since the $71.3 billion sale of assets like 20th Century Studios, FX and National Geographic to Disney in 2019, Fox News plays an outsize role in revenue and profits for Fox Corp.\n\nMurdoch insiders say the pivot back to Trump by the Post and Fox was as predictable as the real estate mogul\u2019s rants on his bully pulpit Truth Social, where he assails Biden and, also, Fox News coverage. (\u201cThey don\u2019t want to discuss how ridiculous the Corrupt Judge\u2019s fine of 450 Million Dollars is. It should be $ZERO,\u201d Trump wrote of Fox and New York Attorney General Letitia James\u2019 case in March.)\n\nMeanwhile, at Murdoch\u2019s financial broadsheet, editor-in-chief of The Wall Street Journal Emma Tucker is preparing to manage her first U.S. presidential election in the role. Tucker, who joined the paper last year from The Sunday Times, has overseen several high-profile layoffs, including in the Journal\u2019s D.C. bureau.\n\nAcross the pond, another election could see the Murdochs change allegiances. The U.K.\u2019s Labour Party, under opposition leader Keir Starmer, is expected to seal a victory in the general election, which must be held no later than January 2025, and Murdoch\u2019s The Sun is considering throwing its weight behind Starmer, two sources say. (The Sun lost $82 million last year as the costs for the phone-hacking scandal continue to add up. Times Media, owner of the Times and Sunday Times, had a more positive result reporting a profit just shy of $76 million.) That political flip might be mercenary, but it\u2019s right out of the playbook that Murdoch has been using for decades: He always backs the winner.\n\nA version of this story first appeared in the April 10 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.

        "text": "The Trump donor whom Biden can\u2019t fire is running the U.S. Postal Service directly into the ground\u2014just what everyone warned about when he was confirmed in the depths of the pandemic\nTechnology has afforded us the ability to connect with nearly anyone, anytime\u2014and free of charge. But there\u2019s just something nostalgic and tactile about receiving a letter or postcard via snail mail, whether it be a wedding invitation or postcard from a loved one far away.\n\nBut many also have a love-hate relationship with the United States Postal Service. Mail is lost, undelivered\u2014or even returned, sometimes with a valid postmark and address. Indeed, \u201cthe Postal Service\u2019s ability to provide acceptable service is an ongoing concern across the United States,\u201d according to the Office of Inspector General for the United States Postal Service.\n\nYet USPS announced Tuesday a proposed 8% price hike for stamps, bringing the cost of a first-class mail forever stamp to $0.73. It\u2019s just another sign of the unfavorable leadership of Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, who was nominated by the Trump administration and confirmed by an all-Trump-appointed board. DeJoy was a major Republican Party donor and Trump fundraiser\u2014and was also the first postmaster general in two decades without prior USPS experience.\n\nUnder DeJoy, the USPS has been bleeding money. In the first quarter of fiscal 2024 alone, USPS reported a $2.1 billion net loss, more than double its $1 billion net loss during the same time period last year. (A USPS spokesperson said its \u201cfinancial condition has improved,\u201d pointing to a progress report that showed USPS\u2019 projected losses for the decade falling to $70 billion, from $160 billion previously, and saying the agency plans to break even by 2030.)\n\n\u201cUnder DeJoy, USPS has not adequately been controlling labor costs, while quality of service has been going down and prices going up,\u201d said Robert D. Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a think tank that specializes in productivity and innovation issues. \u201cThis is not sustainable, and the more prices go up the more volumes go down, until USPS hits a death spiral.\u201d\n\nBut DeJoy, who was previously under investigation by the FBI in connection with past political fundraising, says he has a 10-year plan to revive the postal service. He\u2019s been in his role since June 2020, and plans to serve his entire appointment. Plus, President Joe Biden doesn\u2019t have the power to remove him from his post, despite how badly the agency is struggling.\n\n\u201cGet used to me,\u201d DeJoy said in February 2021. The postmaster general is appointed by the Board of Governors of the Postal Service\u2014and can only be dismissed by this group, not the president. However, the governors are appointed by the president, and in 2022, 83 public interest groups led by the Save the Post Office Coalition sent a letter to Biden urging him to nominate postal board of governors candidates who would hold DeJoy accountable for his \u201cdestructive leadership and advocate strongly for the expansion of USPS services.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s nominees should provide a diversity of life experience to more accurately represent both the postal workforce and the nation overall\u2014not just another rich white man like Louis DeJoy,\u201d Porter McConnell, cofounder of the Save the Post Office Coalition, said in a statement.\n\nIn 2022, the USPS board added two new members who were nominated by President Biden and approved by the Senate.\n\nWhy the USPS keeps upping its prices\n\nThis is the second time in six months that USPS has requested to raise service prices, most recently hiking shipping service rates 5.4% in November 2023.\n\n\u201cPricing changes in the mailing and shipping marketplace continue, [and] these price adjustments are needed to achieve the financial stability sought by the organization\u2019s Delivering for America 10-year plan,\u201d a USPS spokesperson tells Fortune. \u201cThe Postal Service prices remain among the most affordable in the world.\u201d\n\nWhile this may be\u2014at surface level\u2014part of DeJoy\u2019s master plan to remedy poor service across the country, the entity likely won\u2019t be able to continue to raise prices indefinitely, experts say.\n\n\u201cUSPS is raising prices because it consistently loses money on its business and subsidizing the USPS with general tax dollars is unpopular\u2014and unnecessary,\u201d Stephen Henn, adjunct professor of economics and finance at Sacred Heart University, tells Fortune. Plus, USPS can\u2019t be as profitable as FedEx or UPS because the cost to mail letters and packages still is comparatively much cheaper than using a for-profit option.\n\nSome of the factors that contribute to dissatisfaction among USPS users\u2014and overall decreased productivity\u2014include reduced mail volumes, increased operating costs, and a \u201crapid shift\u201d toward digital communications, Robert Khachatryan, CEO of Freight Right Global Logistics, tells Fortune.\n\nAccording to DeJoy\u2019s 10-year plan, he hopes to modernize operations and enhance competitiveness in the shipping and mailing industry while mail volumes decline, Khachatryan says. But it also seeks to add funding to address ongoing USPS service challenges across the country. Nearly every U.S. state is below target levels for on-time service, according to Office of Inspector General for the United States Postal Service data.\n\n\u201cThe push for price increases partly stems from the ongoing challenge of maintaining acceptable service levels,\u201d Khachatryan says. \u201cThe Office of the Inspector General\u2019s reports highlight service as a persistent concern, suggesting that additional revenue from higher prices could be directed towards improving operational efficiencies and customer service.\u201d\n\nPlus, USPS has requirements that for-profit businesses like FedEx and UPS do not. USPS has to deliver first-class mail to every address in the U.S. at the same rate, despite the distance.\n\n\u201cSending Grandma a holiday card costs the same whether sent from Maine to New York or Maine to Hawaii,\u201d Henn says. \u201cFor-profit companies can charge based on the cost of delivering from Maine to New York or Hawaii.\u201d\n\nA USPS spokesperson also noted that the agency is battling \u201ca universal curtailment of advertising expenditures, significant inflation costs and the continued existence of an improper Civil Service Retirement System allocation.\u201d The issues have led to $6 billion in unplanned costs for 2023, DeJoy said in remarks in 2023. However, at 73 cents, the price of first-class stamps will have gone up 32% since 2019, much faster than the overall rate of inflation.\n\nDespite the challenges of competing with for-profit organizations, DeJoy remains confident that he can rescue the ailing agency in the years to come.\n\n\u201cI grow more confident in our ability to deliver to the nation a postal service whose best days are in the future,\u201d DeJoy told the USPS Board of Governors in February. \u201cWe are in a race to a finish line that changes our financial and service trajectory before we run out of cash and require other means of funding.\u201d\n\nBut other experts don\u2019t have as rosy an outlook for the agency, which technically operates independently from the executive branch of the U.S. federal government.\n\n\u201cThe Postal Regulatory Commission needs to stop being so passive and start holding USPS accountable to cut costs and boost efficiencies,\u201d Atkinson says. \u201cCongress may well have to intervene as well, because the current trend is not sustainable.\u201d\n\nClarification, April 11, 2024: This article has been updated to explain that Postmaster General DeJoy was nominated under former President Trump before he was appointed by the USPS Board of Governors and to add more details about the USPS board members and its costs and revenues.",

        "text": "Election 2024: Why does each state in the U.S. have different voting rules?\nCARTERSVILLE, Ga.\n\nIn Louisiana, any voter can cast a ballot in person during early voting ahead of Election Day. But just across the state line in Mississippi, all voters don\u2019t have this option. In Arizona, a person must show ID to vote, while no such requirement exists in neighboring Nevada.\n\nThis is how America votes.\n\nInstead of one national election under one set of rules that voters everywhere must follow, the U.S. elects its president through more than 10,000 local elections \u2014 each conducted under rules set by state and, to some extent, local governments.\n\n10,000+ election jurisdictions\n\nThe rules can and do vary from state to state \u2013 and sometimes, within a state and even a county.\n\nThis highly decentralized system exists because the nation\u2019s Founding Fathers in drafting the Constitution gave authority over elections to the states, rather than the federal government. While Congress has the power to regulate \u2013 and has done so to pass such laws as the Voting Rights Act \u2013 the Constitution makes clear that states have primary authority to set the \u201ctimes, places and manner\u201d for elections.\n\nState lawmakers approve the laws that govern the voting process in their states \u2013 and this can vary widely, depending on how they think elections should work.\n\nThere also is no national election agency that administers the presidential contest, as often exists outside the U.S. And when it comes to doing the day-to-day work of running an election, the responsibility falls to officials at the local level \u2014 usually a clerk or election supervisor \u2013 with help from staff and volunteers.\n\nPaula Romanovsky carries her ballot to vote in a booth at the Columbarium in San Francisco, Tuesday, March 5, 2024.

(AP Photo/Richard Vogel)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat may seem disorderly, with the sheer number of election jurisdictions and various laws, is actually by design. Still, confusion about how elections are run and laws that differ from state to state helped fuel conspiracy theories still swirling today about the 2020 election, including the false claim that the presidential election was stolen.\n\nIn fact, there was no widespread fraud or tampering with the vote. And rules that differ don\u2019t mean an election was inaccurate or that fraud occurred.\n\n\u201cWhile election laws and regulations differ from state to state, the common threads of bipartisanship, transparency and professionalism undergird the work of election administrators,\u201d said Jennifer Morrell, a former election official in Utah and Colorado.\n\n\u201cIn every state, policy makers are charged with creating the rules, election officials are responsible for carrying them out, and voters \u2013 regardless of party affiliation \u2013 are bound to them.\u201d\n\nElection jurisdictions range from urban counties like Los Angeles, with millions of voters, to tiny places such as Dixville Township, New Hampshire, where registered voters \u2014 this year there were six \u2014 turn out at midnight to cast the first ballots of the 2024 presidential primary.\n\nThe differences in U.S. election laws range from how voters receive a ballot to what it takes to have it counted and whether a person can walk up to a polling place on Election Day and register to vote or must plan weeks ahead.\n\nIt can get complicated \u2014 quickly.\n\nFor example, in most states, people have several days or even weeks leading up to Election Day to cast their vote through early voting. But four states \u2013 Alabama, Delaware, Mississippi and New Hampshire \u2013 don\u2019t offer early voting.\n\nIn the states that do have it, the period when early voting is available can vary, from three days to more than seven weeks before an election.\n\nFor those states that do offer early, in-person voting, this experience can range from using a voting machine at a countywide vote center to filling out an absentee ballot inside a local election office.\n\nWhile every state has mail voting, some send mail ballots to all registered voters whether they want one or not. In others, voters must request a mail ballot. In some states, voters must provide a reason \u2013 such as a disability or being away from home \u2013 for not being able to go to their polling place.\n\nAnd 36 states require or request ID to vote, while 14 states and D.C. don\u2019t, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nYet for all the differences in election rules, experts say it\u2019s a strength that the nation\u2019s elections are so decentralized.\n\n\u201cThere are policies that people of good faith can have disagreements about,\u201d said David Levine, a former local election official in Idaho who is now a senior fellow with the German Marshall Fund\u2019s Alliance for Securing Democracy. He noted voting preferences often fall along geographical and political lines and there are advantages to allowing for differences.\n\n\u201cWe have a history in this country of having a decentralized system. Most states \u2013 red or blue \u2013 like to have the ability to experiment and innovate,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt allows jurisdictions to innovate and experiment and make policies that work for their voters,\u201d Levine added. \u201cAnd in many ways, it makes it harder to rig a national election.\u201d\n\nTo pull off stealing a presidential election, it would require large numbers of election workers in the most competitive counties across the country who are willing to risk prosecution, prison time and fines while working with officials from both parties willing to look the other way. And everyone somehow would have to keep quiet \u2013 a highly unlikely scenario.\n\nThere are also shared practices and security measures in place across the country that together work to ensure that only eligible voters can cast a ballot and only one ballot is counted for each.\n\nAll states have a multi-step process for verifying mail ballots, typically starting with regular reviews to ensure the list of eligible voters and their addresses is as accurate and up to date as possible. This includes work by election officials to verify the ballot is legitimate, checking the voter\u2019s name and address on the ballot envelope to ensure it\u2019s the same person who was sent the ballot and \u2013 in most cases \u2013 matching a voter\u2019s signature or ID information to the voter file.\n\nAll election offices also have measures in place to ensure that every registered voter casts only one ballot, and officials conduct post-election audits that in many cases include a hand count of a pre-selected number of ballots to ensure tabulators counted correctly.\n\nIt\u2019s work that never really ends. All around the country, election offices are constantly receiving voter registration applications, checking eligibility, scanning death and court records and removing ineligible voters from the rolls.\n\n\u201cOne misnomer, a misunderstanding, is that we only work around an election,\u201d said Joseph Kirk, election supervisor in Bartow County, Georgia. \u201cIt\u2019s a full-time job when we\u2019re not having an election. When we are having an election, we work 60 hours a week.\u201d\n\nElectronic Voting Technician Beth Howard works at the Bartow County Election office, Thursday, Jan. 25, 2024, in Cartersville, Ga. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, left, speaks with Bartow County Election Supervisor Joseph Kirk at the county election office, Thursday, Jan. 25, 2024, in Cartersville, Ga.\n\nThat was the case on a cold and rainy day in January, when Kirk and his staff at the elections office north of Atlanta were getting ready for Georgia\u2019s March 12 presidential primary.\n\nInside a former state office building, county election workers were reviewing ballots, testing voting machines, processing absentee ballot requests and making plans for the county\u2019s roughly 76,000 active voters to cast their ballots.\n\nIn Georgia, voters have access to automatic voter registration, three weeks of early voting, no-excuse mail ballots and at least one ballot drop box per county. Next door in Alabama, these options are not available.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of communities in the United States,\u201d said Kirk, who oversees the office. \u201cWhat works for one may not work for another.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press receives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

It's already illegal\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Wilfredo Lee/AP Wilfredo Lee/AP\n\nFormer President Donald Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., appeared together Friday to tout legislation aimed at stopping something that is already illegal in America: noncitizens voting in federal elections.\n\nJohnson gave a broad overview of a bill House Republicans will soon introduce that would implement new citizenship documentation requirements for people to register to vote, which experts have said would make voting harder for many eligible voters like naturalized citizens and young voters.\n\n\"We cannot wait for widespread fraud to occur,\" he said at a news conference at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort. \"Especially when the threat of fraud is growing with every single illegal immigrant that crosses that [southern U.S.] border.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe myth that immigrants are exerting undue influence on American elections has been floating around U.S. politics for more than 100 years.\n\nIndividual states began banning noncitizens from voting more than a century ago, and Congress passed a law in 1996 that explicitly banned the practice in all federal elections.\n\nNumerous studies have also confirmed that it almost never happens, but as more conservative voters say immigration is a key issue for them, it's become clearer that election misinformation in 2024 will center on the topic as well.\n\nLast month, NPR acquired a two-page memo being circulated by conservative attorney Cleta Mitchell, a former adviser to Trump, that pushed a number of false narratives around noncitizens voting. The document focused mostly on the implementation of a 1993 law that made registering to vote easier, and Johnson mentioned the law in his remarks Friday as well.\n\nThey both have also pushed the unfounded idea that the Biden administration is allowing migrants to cross the southern border for political gain.\n\n\"We believe one of the reasons for this open border ... is because they want to turn these people into voters,\" Johnson said, without providing any evidence.\n\nElection officials verify citizenship in different ways in different states, but federal law requires voters to provide a unique identification number when they register to vote and because that is usually either a driver's license or Social Security number, election officials can usually work with those agencies to verify citizenship status.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"Most applicants use their [driver's license] to register,\" Tammy Patrick, a former local election official in Arizona who is now the CEO of the nonprofit Election Center, wrote in an email. \"This number often serves as the validation of citizenship since most DMVs retain citizenship status in their databases.\"\n\nExperts say introducing legislation, however, is a way for lawmakers to indicate to voters this issue is something to be concerned about, even as there's never been evidence to support the idea noncitizens are voting at anything other than miniscule numbers.\n\nSince 2020, nine states have enacted new laws aiming to identify and remove noncitizens from their voter rolls, and legislation is currently active in 16 states, according to the Voting Rights Lab.\n\n\"Perception is 9/10 of reality,\" Ron Hayduk, an expert on noncitizen voting at San Francisco State University, said in an interview with NPR earlier this year. \"Putting the solution on the table suggests there was a problem. And I think that's part of the point. [These laws] create a solution to a problem that doesn't exist.\"\n\nGeorgia's Republican secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, had his office perform a citizenship audit in 2022 that found fewer than 2,000 suspected noncitizens registering to vote in the state over the prior 25 years. None were actually able to cast a ballot.\n\n\"Noncitizens are not voting in Georgia,\" Raffensperger said in a recent interview with NPR, though he did laud Johnson and Trump's remarks Friday.\n\nAnd a recent study in Arizona (first reported by The Washington Post) found that less than 1% of noncitizens attempt to register to vote, and even in those cases, the vast majority are thought to be mistakes.\n\nAdding confusion to the issue, however, is the fact that a few local jurisdictions have moved to allow noncitizens to vote in local elections. San Francisco, for instance, allows resident noncitizen parents and guardians to vote in school board elections, and some cities in Maryland and Vermont allow noncitizens to vote in municipal elections.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nElection officials in those jurisdictions implement practices to make sure those voters don't cast ballots in races they aren't supposed to.\n\nBut Hayduk says even in places where noncitizens can legally vote, they often don't. People he's interviewed about their experience in these places don't want to risk their status in the U.S. just to cast a single ballot \u2014 further proof, in his eyes, that this isn't an actual problem.\n\n\"Time and time again in the interviews we did, we heard from immigrants who said they were super excited about this new law to allow them to vote, and it felt like it affirmed their voices. ... But, you know, put themselves at risk? Not worth it,\" Hayduk said. \"So clearly, they're not going to do that for a federal election where there's an explicit law passed in 1996 that would impose very serious felony crimes ... and that would certainly lead to their detention and deportation.\"",

        "text": "Noncitizen voting isn\u2019t an issue in federal elections, regardless of conspiracy theories. Here\u2019s why\nFormer President Donald Trump turned to one of his favorite themes on Friday \u2014 the specter of immigrants improperly voting in federal elections. House Speaker Mike Johnson came to the former president\u2019s Florida compound to announce that he would introduce a bill to stop those who are not citizens from voting in elections.\n\nTrump has made baseless claims about this subject before, like in 2016, when he blamed his loss of the popular vote on voting by immigrants, and then appointed a commission to investigate the issue. It disbanded without identifying a single case of a noncitizen casting a vote.\n\nHe and other Republicans have recently revved up their conspiratorial claims about the issue with the influx of migrants across the southern border under Biden, contending Democrats are letting them in to add them to the voter rolls.\n\nThe theory involves two complicated subjects, immigration and voting, but it\u2019s actually very simple. There isn\u2019t any indication that noncitizens vote in significant numbers in federal elections or that they will in the future. It\u2019s already a crime for them to do so. And we know it\u2019s not a danger because various states have examined their rolls and found very few noncitizen voters.\n\nTo be clear, there have been cases of noncitizens casting ballots, but they are extremely rare. Those who have looked into these cases say they often involve legal immigrants who mistakenly believe they have the right to vote.\n\nJohnson tried to address this, saying that \u201cwe cannot wait for widespread fraud to occur.\u201d But one prior crackdown on purported noncitizen voting also risked striking thousands of actual citizens from the voting rolls.\n\nHere\u2019s why noncitizen voting isn\u2019t a real danger to the integrity of federal elections and the risks of changing federal law.\n\nWHAT\u2019S THE LAW?\n\nFederal law requires all voter registration forms to advise those signing up that they have to swear under penalty of perjury that they are a U.S. citizen. That has generally worked. Immigrants who aren\u2019t citizens especially don\u2019t want to violate the law because it could jeopardize their ability to remain in the country or become citizens.\n\nSome Republicans have long complained that federal laws don\u2019t require additional checks on voter eligibility. Johnson vowed to introduce legislation requiring proof of citizenship before allowing someone to register to vote, but he provided no further details. It\u2019s likely that such legislation wouldn\u2019t make it out of the Democratic-controlled Senate, and its main impact would be to use it as a talking point against Democrats during the campaign.\n\nOne reason Democrats are wary is that when Texas tried to root out noncitizen voters in 2019, the effort ended up wrongly flagging tens of thousands of U.S. citizens as being ineligible to vote. A federal judge blocked Texas from carrying out the law and the then-secretary of state resigned.\n\nThat shows the risks of adding new identification checks to catch something that very rarely happens.\n\nWHAT\u2019S THE EVIDENCE THAT THIS ISN\u2019T A PROBLEM?\n\nAll available evidence shows that noncitizen voting in federal elections is incredibly rare. It\u2019s illegal for people who aren\u2019t U.S. citizens to vote in federal elections, but it is legal for them to vote in local elections if the jurisdiction allows it. A small number of local jurisdictions, such as San Francisco and the District of Columbia, let immigrants who haven\u2019t become U.S. citizens vote on races for school board and city council.\n\nLet\u2019s look at some conservative-leaning states to see if noncitizen voting is an issue. First, we\u2019re talking about \u201cnoncitizen\u201d voting, not voting by immigrants. That\u2019s because some immigrants have become naturalized U.S. citizens and under the Constitution have the same ability to cast a ballot as those born here.\n\nIn 2016, North Carolina audited its elections to make sure no one voted improperly. It found that 41 legal immigrants who had not yet become citizens cast ballots. That\u2019s out of 4.8 million votes cast. Those illegal votes didn\u2019t make a difference in a single election in the state, even the smallest local race, according to the state\u2019s election board. Trump\u2019s Department of Justice later filed criminal charges against 19 immigrants for illegally voting in North Carolina.\n\nIn 2022, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, conducted an audit of his state\u2019s voter rolls specifically looking for noncitizens. His office found that 1,634 had attempted to register, but election officials had caught all the applications and none were actually registered to vote.\n\nThe Brennan Center for Justice, a liberal group, surveyed 44 election officials in some of the most populous and immigrant-heavy jurisdictions in the country after 2016, including Arizona, California and Texas. It found only about 30 incidents of a possible noncitizen voting out of 23.5 million votes cast in those places.\n\nOne researcher used internet poll data to extrapolate the number of noncitizens voting and concluded there must be more casting ballots than the reviews have caught. Trump cited his work in 2016, but even that researcher, Professor Jesse Richman of Old Dominion University, has said Trump misused his work and that there is no evidence noncitizen voting was high enough to swing a state against the former president.\n\nIS ANYONE ELSE CHANGING LAWS ON THIS?\n\nThe Voting Rights Lab, a left-leaning group that tracks voting legislation, says that since the 2020 election and Trump\u2019s lies about losing because of fraud, nine states have implemented new laws to further block noncitizen voting and 16 are currently considering additional provisions.\n\nThat tally includes Texas, where the Republican-controlled legislature passed a sweeping voting bill in 2021 that revived the provision that had earlier led to tens of thousands of U.S. citizens erroneously being flagged as illegal voters. Civil rights groups have again sued to block it. The Republican National Committee, which Trump brought under his control recently, is arguing in court to keep the provision.",

        "text": "9 facts about U.S. Catholics\nAsh Wednesday at the Co-Cathedral of the Sacred Heart in Houston. (Raquel Natalicchio/Houston Chronicle via Getty Images)\n\nCatholics are one of the largest religious groups in the United States, outnumbering any single Protestant denomination. The U.S. has more Catholics than all but three other countries \u2013 Brazil, Mexico and the Philippines \u2013 according to the Vatican\u2019s Statistical Yearbook of the Church.\n\nHere are nine key facts about the U.S. Catholic population.\n\nHow we did this Pew Research Center conducted this analysis to serve as a reference source on the basic demographic attributes, religious characteristics and political preferences of U.S. Catholics. The analysis draws mainly on data from the Center\u2019s National Public Opinion Reference Surveys (NPORS) conducted in 2022 and 2023. NPORS is an annual survey of U.S. adults who are selected for participation using address-based sampling from the U.S. Postal Service\u2019s Delivery Sequence File. Respondents may answer either by paper or online. This post also relies on a variety of surveys conducted online among respondents who are part of the Center\u2019s American Trends Panel or other national survey panels recruited through random sampling (not \u201copt-in\u201d polls). All of the surveys used in this analysis are weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, education and other categories.\n\nToday, 20% of U.S. adults describe themselves as Catholics, according to our latest survey. This percentage has been generally stable since 2014. But it is slightly lower than in 2007, when 24% of U.S. adults identified as Catholic.\n\nOverall, there were about 262 million adults in the U.S. in 2023, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. This suggests that there are roughly 52 million Catholic adults nationwide.\n\nMost U.S. Catholics are White, but a third are Hispanic. The Catholic population is 57% White, 33% Hispanic, 4% Asian and 2% Black, while 3% are of another race.\n\nSince 2007, the share of U.S. Catholics who are White has dropped by 8 percentage points, while the share who are Hispanic has ticked upward by 4 points.\n\nThis change has implications for the profile of Catholic Americans as a whole because White Catholics have distinctive social and political traits, as we\u2019ll discuss in more detail below.\n\nCatholics tend to be older than Americans overall. Nearly six-in-ten Catholic adults (58%) are ages 50 and older. Among all U.S. adults in the survey, by comparison, 48% fall in this age range.\n\nBut Hispanic Catholics tend to be a lot younger than White Catholics. Fewer than half of Hispanic Catholics (43%) are 50 and older, compared with about two-thirds (68%) of White Catholics. And just 14% of Hispanic Catholics are ages 65 and older, versus 38% of White Catholics.\n\nRoughly three-in-ten U.S. Catholics (29%) live in the South, while 26% live in the Northeast, 24% in the West and 21% in the Midwest.\n\nThe racial and ethnic profile of the Catholic population varies considerably by region. For example, in the Midwest, 80% of Catholics are White and 17% are Hispanic. In the Northeast, 72% of Catholics are White and 19% are Hispanic.\n\nIn the South, 49% are White and 40% are Hispanic. And in the West, there are more Hispanic Catholics than White Catholics (55% vs. 30%).\n\nAbout a third of U.S. Catholics (32%) have a bachelor\u2019s degree. Another 28% have some college experience but not a bachelor\u2019s degree, and 40% have a high school education or less. This distribution is similar to that of the general adult population.\n\nOn average, White Catholics have higher levels of educational attainment than Hispanic Catholics. Roughly four-in-ten White Catholics (39%) have at least a bachelor\u2019s degree, while 32% have a high school education or less. Among Hispanic Catholics, 16% have a bachelor\u2019s degree and 59% have a high school education or less.\n\nAbout three-in-ten U.S. Catholics (28%) say they attend Mass weekly or more often. Larger shares of Catholics say they pray on a daily basis (52%) and say religion is very important in their life (46%).\n\nOverall, 20% of U.S. Catholics say they attend Mass weekly and pray daily and consider religion very important in their life. By contrast, 10% of Catholics say they attend Mass a few times a year or less often and pray seldom or never and consider religion not too or not all important in their life.\n\nBy way of comparison, 40% of U.S. Protestants say they attend services at least weekly. And about two-thirds of Protestants pray daily (67%) and say religion is very important in their life (66%).\n\nAbout half of Catholic registered voters (52%) identify with or lean toward the Republican Party, while 44% affiliate with the Democratic Party.\n\nBut partisan affiliation varies by race and ethnicity. Roughly six-in-ten White Catholic registered voters (61%) say they identify with or lean toward the GOP, compared with 35% of Hispanic Catholics.\n\nConversely, 60% of Hispanic Catholics who are registered voters say they identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party, compared with 37% of White Catholics.\n\nIn the 2022 congressional midterm elections, 56% of Catholics said they voted for Republican candidates, while 43% backed Democrats. And in the 2020 presidential election, Catholic voters were split down the middle: 49% backed Donald Trump and 50% voted for Joe Biden.\n\nThese overall splits hide big differences between White and Hispanic Catholic voters. For example, White Catholics favored Trump over Biden by a 15-point margin in 2020, while Hispanic Catholics backed Biden over Trump by a 35-point margin.\n\nWhile the Catholic Church opposes abortion, about six-in-ten Catholics say abortion should be legal. This includes 39% who say it should be legal in most cases and 22% who say it should be legal in all cases. Roughly four-in-ten Catholics say abortion should be illegal in most (28%) or all (11%) cases.\n\nCatholics\u2019 opinions about abortion tend to align with their political leanings. Among Catholic Democrats, 78% say abortion should be legal in most or all cases. Among Catholic Republicans, 43% say this.\n\nCatholic Democrats are a little less likely than non-Catholic Democrats to say abortion should be legal in most or all cases (78% vs. 86%).\n\nThree-quarters of Catholics view Pope Francis favorably, according to our February 2024 survey. That\u2019s a little lower than the 80% of Catholics or more who expressed a positive view of Francis in many previous polls during his papacy, which began in 2013.\n\nCatholic Democrats (89%) are much more likely than Catholic Republicans (63%) to view Francis favorably.\n\nNote: This is an update of a post originally published Sept. 4, 2018.",

That\u2019ll threaten this concept of loser\u2019s consent, where the side that loses agrees to go along with the outcome and try again next time,\u201d says Thad Kousser, a professor of political science at the University of California, San Diego.\n\nFrom Boss Tweed to the Voting Rights Act\n\nTo some degree, distrust in U.S. election outcomes has been part of the nation\u2019s political culture for centuries. It was fed in the late 1800s by the blatant fraud schemes of Democratic urban machines, which included stuffing vote boxes with reams of ballots pre-printed with approved slates of candidates. \u201cI don\u2019t think there was ever an honest election in the City of New York,\u201d the notorious Tammany Hall leader William \u201cBoss\u201d Tweed once testified before the Board of Aldermen.\n\nReforms meant to rein in some of these abuses were an important part of the Progressive Era of the early 1900s. They included laws establishing the direct election of U.S. senators, processes for referendums whereby citizens vote on some issues directly, and a movement for women\u2019s voting rights.\n\nMoves to ensure more citizens could vote continued during the rights revolution of the 1960s. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 aimed to end the suppression of Black citizens\u2019 ballots. Later, the enactment of the 26th Amendment to the Constitution in 1971 lowered the voting age for all U.S. elections to 18.\n\nCarlos Osorio/AP Election workers sort through absentee ballots in Warren, Michigan, Feb. 27, 2024.\n\nThe 1980s saw states begin to ease rules on absentee ballots, allowing citizens to cast votes in person prior to Election Day, or for ballots to be mailed to all eligible voters. This trend peaked in the 2020 election with a raft of accommodations designed to ensure people could vote during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBy measures of access, U.S. elections in the 21st century have become more open than ever. That is an important component of trust for Democratic-leaning citizens, polls show. But at the same time, in recent decades, a number of factors began pushing public opinion, on both the left and right, in the other direction, toward a crisis of confidence in elections.\n\nThough that crisis is currently more widespread on the right side of the political spectrum, it is not hard to see how events in the 2024 election cycle could engender similar feelings on the left, according to a report by two dozen experts on law, elections, and information security.\n\n\u201cNo longer can we take for granted that people will accept election results as legitimate,\u201d stated the report, titled \u201c24 for \u201924: Urgent Recommendations in Law, Media, Politics, and Tech for Fair and Legitimate 2024 U.S. Elections\u201d and produced under the auspices of the Safeguarding Democracy Project at UCLA\u2019s School of Law.\n\n\u201cDid your team win?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to measure the loss of trust in elections accurately with traditional public opinion methods, experts say. \u201cTrust\u201d is a broad concept that covers many different emotions.\n\nBut one major reason is the winner-loser effect: the well-documented phenomenon whereby a party or person\u2019s trust in an election tends to rise if their candidate wins, and fall if they lose.\n\nIt\u2019s human nature. A fan watching a baseball game is less likely to trust a close call that goes against their team. A close call against the opposing team, however, seems fair. When it comes to elections, trust and mistrust often come and go, rising and falling for one party or the other over the years.\n\n\u201cThese ebbs and flows are usually determined by, \u2018Hey, did your team win or lose?\u2019\u201d says Professor Kousser.\n\nNor is electoral trust a long-studied subject. It was only after the Bush-Gore election of 2000 that political scientists began to look at it in a systematic way.\n\nAs an election, the razor-close contest between Republican Texas Governor Bush and Democratic Vice President Al Gore was a mess.\n\nIt all came down to Florida. Palm Beach\u2019s \u201cbutterfly\u201d ballot, in which the name of the candidate was misaligned with the space voters pressed to mark their choices, confused many people. Other locales used punch-out ballots, which were difficult for some voters to punch out cleanly, leading to the \u201changing chads\u201d of paper that weary election officials were tasked with evaluating.\n\nA five-week legal battle followed. Democratic lawyers pushed for recounts, while Republicans sued to block them. Finally, after legal twists and turns in the state courts, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5-4 to stop the process. The ruling effectively delivered the state, and the presidency, to Governor Bush by a margin of some 500 votes.\n\nBush v. Gore remains one of the most politically consequential Supreme Court decisions in American history.\n\n\u201cBush v. Gore was a turning point, not only in marking elections as something to be trustful or mistrustful about, but also in marking the Supreme Court as something to be trustful or mistrustful about,\u201d says Charles Stewart III, professor of political science and director of the Election Data and Science Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nWilfredo Lee/AP/File Canvassing board member Judge Robert Rosenberg examines a challenged vote during recount efforts at the Broward County Emergency Operations Center in Plantation, Florida, Nov. 22, 2000.\n\nOn Jan. 6, 2001, then-Vice President Gore had the painful duty of presiding over his own loss in his role as president of the Senate.\n\nAs Congress voted state by state to certify the election, 20 members of the House, most of them members of the Congressional Black Caucus, rose one by one to file objections to Florida\u2019s electoral votes.\n\nNo senators joined them \u2013 a requirement under federal law for their challenge to be considered. So Mr. Gore, as presiding officer, slammed down his gavel to rule them out of order.\n\n\u201cWe did all we could,\u201d Florida Democratic Rep. Alcee Hastings said to Mr. Gore as the protest fizzled.\n\n\u201cThe chair thanks the gentlemen,\u201d Mr. Gore replied with a smile.\n\nRising distrust on the right\n\nBy 2004, Democrats were watching closely for any signs that election integrity might be compromised and affecting outcomes. Two congressional Democrats filed an objection to certifying Ohio\u2019s Electoral College votes, citing alleged irregularities in both vote counting and public access to voting stations.\n\nAfter President Bush\u2019s reelection that year, Republicans had considerably more trust in the election system than Democrats did. Eighty-seven percent of self-described Republicans were very or somewhat confident that votes were counted accurately in the election, according to Gallup polling. Fifty-nine percent of Democrats felt the same way, as well as 69% of independents.\n\nBut by the eve of the midterm elections in 2022, GOP electoral trust had fallen to 40%, according to Gallup. Democratic trust had risen to 85%.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nFormer President Barack Obama, for one thing. Mr. Obama\u2019s 2008 victory and 2012 reelection led to a sharp slump in the Republican trust figure, and a gradual rise for the Democratic one. The factors at work, many analysts say, included latent racism surrounding the nation\u2019s first Black president, intertwined with a \u201cbirther\u201d movement falsely questioning his citizenship.\n\nThen Donald Trump came onto the scene. Mr. Trump\u2019s 2016 election did cause Republican trust in voting to increase. But then came his defeat in 2020 \u2013 and his dogged insistence that the vote had been rigged, despite a lack of evidence and repudiations by the courts \u2013 as well as a less-than-impressive showing for the party in the 2022 midterms. It all drove GOP approval of the U.S. election system to historic lows in Gallup\u2019s polling series.\n\nGenerally, individuals will say they approve of their own voting experience, and think their ballot was accurately tallied, unless they deal with unexpectedly long lines or face some sort of equipment malfunction. Far more common is suspicion about what happens in other precincts or states.\n\nIn that context, what party leaders and authority figures say matters. Mr. Trump spoke darkly of fraud and cheating in elections even prior to his 2016 win. In 2020, he claimed on Election Day that he had actually won. His followers stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, seeking to stop the Electoral College counting. Since then, his false insistence that the election was rigged has become an article of faith among not just his most ardent supporters but Republicans in general \u2013 and something that other GOP leaders question at their peril.\n\nTrust in elections has long been an elastic issue \u2013 one that U.S. political parties change their minds about, and flip positions on. But it is now possible that it has been polarized, like abortion or immigration, with fixed views on the GOP side, at least.\n\n\u201cI think there is going to be this persistent, organized distrust of a lot of elements of the election system among Republicans,\u201d says Professor Stewart. \u201cIt could [also] be among Democrats under the right circumstances, but right now it is among Republicans.\u201d\n\nThis dynamic has driven calls for hand-counting of ballots, withdrawals from a multistate partnership that checks registrations to clean up voter rolls, and anger toward local election officials, says Professor Stewart.\n\n\u201cIt could also potentially lead to violence,\u201d he says.\n\nAs the 2024 campaign gears up, Mr. Trump has only intensified his dark rhetoric about the American electoral system. He routinely promises to pardon those convicted of crimes on Jan. 6, though hundreds were charged with assaulting police. These \u201chostages\u201d are \u201cunbelievable patriots,\u201d he often says.\n\nHe continues to demean mail-in voting despite lack of evidence, telling Laura Ingraham earlier this year that \u201cyou\u2019re going to automatically have fraud\u201d if it is allowed.\n\nJob applicants at the Republican National Committee are now reportedly asked whether they agree the last presidential election was stolen. At rallies, Mr. Trump continues to insist he was robbed, though he wasn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cRadical left Democrats rigged the presidential election of 2020, and we\u2019re not going to allow them to rig the presidential election of 2024!\u201d Mr. Trump said in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, earlier this year.\n\nHe portrays the coming election not as a civic choice that is part of a centurieslong tradition of parties losing and winning but as an apocalyptic event.\n\nPresident Biden\u2019s administration seeks \u201cto collapse the American system, nullify the will of the actual American voters, and establish a new base of power that gives them control for generations,\u201d Mr. Trump told a North Carolina audience in March.\n\nThe task of rebuilding trust\n\nGOP election denialism is not all-encompassing. Republican officials such as Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger were key defenders of the system\u2019s integrity in 2020, after all.\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2022 midterm elections, there were not widespread complaints about alleged fraud, despite the fact that an anticipated \u201cred wave\u201d of GOP gains didn\u2019t happen. Defeated Arizona GOP gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake did pursue fraud charges in court, without success, but she may have been the exception that proved the rule. Like Mr. Trump, she had made warnings of a possibly stolen result a core part of her political identity prior to the election.\n\nRecent polls have also shown some bounce-back from the lows of GOP electoral trust following 2020, even in many hotly contested swing states.\n\nAbout one-quarter of Republicans say they believe President Biden fairly won election in 2020, according to a survey taken late last year by the Johns Hopkins SNF Agora Institute and Gallup. Another 12% say they are unsure about the outcome.\n\nThis group is a moveable section of the GOP electorate that is open to messages that U.S. elections are secure and the system is not rife with fraud, says Scott Warren, a fellow at the Agora Institute, via email.\n\nStill, rebuilding trust in U.S. elections will require a bipartisan effort, according to Mr. Warren. Too many democracy reform initiatives don\u2019t involve conservatives in any substantive way.\n\nDeepen your worldview\n\nwith Monitor Highlights.

        "text": "April 12, 2024 - The latest on the 2024 campaign\nLawyers for Donald Trump asked the judge overseeing the criminal hush money case to alter his plans for handling jury selection days before the historic trial is set to get underway next week.\n\nOn Monday, Judge Juan Merchan outlined how he would handle jury selection, advising that he would ask the pool of jurors whether anyone felt they couldn\u2019t be fair or impartial or otherwise serve in the case and then excuse those who raised their hands without inquiring further. Trump\u2019s lawyers initially asked the judge for the ability to question each of the jurors, but the judge said that is \u201cunnecessary, time-consuming, and of no benefit.\u201d\n\nIn a letter Friday afternoon, Trump\u2019s attorneys said that approach is \u201cinadequate because the plan would not create a sufficient record for the purpose of any necessary appellate review, or a venue-change motion.\u201d\n\nInstead, they are asking the judge to distinguish between jurors who said they can\u2019t be fair and those who are otherwise unable to serve. \u201cThat clarity is necessary so that President Trump can present arguments to the First Department, if and when necessary, regarding the number of potential jurors who believed they harbored a disqualifying bias before questioning, as well as the number of additional potential jurors who reveal a disqualifying bias during questioning.\u201d\n\nThe filing comes as Trump is continuing to attempt to build a case for his appeals. Earlier this week Trump\u2019s lawyers tried to stop the trial arguing the former president can\u2019t get a fair trial in Manhattan and have appealed seeking a venue change. Briefs are due later this month.\n\nOn Friday Trump\u2019s lawyers also argued the jury questionnaire lacks a question to \u201cidentify potential jurors who align with rival political parties that are not necessarily \u2018anti-Trump\u2019 but could still support a disqualifying bias that is worth of follow-up inquiry by the defense.\u201d\n\nIf the judge doesn\u2019t amend the questions, Trump\u2019s lawyers ask that they be allowed to ask questions to explore any affiliations.",

        "text": "Noncitizen Voting Isn\u2019t Affecting State or Federal Elections \u2014 Here\u2019s Why\nImagine you\u2019re an undocumented person living in the United States. You\u2019ve come to this country seeking a better life for you and your family. Or maybe your parents brought you here seeking the same when you were a child. You spend your life living in very real fear that you might be noticed by the government and be deported \u2014 perhaps to a country you\u2019ve never known. There\u2019s an election coming up, the outcome of which will surely impact your life. But you know you can\u2019t vote because you\u2019re not a citizen. Would you risk everything \u2014 your freedom, your life in the United States, your ability to be near your family \u2014 just to cast a single ballot?\n\nOf course you wouldn\u2019t. It\u2019s a federal crime for noncitizens to vote in federal elections. It\u2019s also a crime under every state\u2019s laws. In fact, under federal law, you could face up to five years in prison simply for registering to vote. It\u2019s also a deportable offense for noncitizens to register or vote. And sure, people make bad decisions and commit crimes all the time. But this one is different: by committing the crime, you create a government record of your having committed it. In fact, it\u2019s the creation of the government record \u2014 the registration form or the ballot cast \u2014 that is the crime. So, you\u2019ve not only exposed yourself to prison time and deportation, you\u2019ve put yourself on the government\u2019s radar, and you\u2019ve handed the government the evidence it needs to put you in prison or deport you. All so you could cast one vote. Who would do such a thing?\n\nMaybe you\u2019re thinking that there are a bunch of noncitizens voting and getting away with it. Again, consider the fact that in order to commit these crimes you create a government record of having committed them. Indeed, anyone can look up your voter history on public voter files. And election officials conduct regular maintenance of these voter lists \u2014 in fact, they\u2019re required to by federal law. Moreover, these are crimes that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services officers are instructed to look into during the naturalization process. So, if you ever try to become a citizen, you\u2019ll be caught.\n\nIt should come as no surprise then that in the extremely rare instances when a noncitizen does cast a ballot, it\u2019s usually an accident. Sadly, there have been times when noncitizens are misled by mistaken officials into thinking that they\u2019re eligible \u2014 and they can face serious consequences even as a result of a mistake.\n\nBut noncitizen voting is simply not a widespread or even a significant occurrence. And it\u2019s already illegal. We don\u2019t need new laws to stop it from happening. If Congress wants to improve our electoral system, it should focus instead on guaranteeing and protecting the freedom to vote for eligible voters.",

Trump's attacks are complicating efforts at the Trump campaign to convince Republicans to vote by mail .",
        "text": "Trump\u2019s crusade against mail-in ballots undercuts campaign pitch to vote early\nDonald Trump\u2019s attacks on mail-in voting have increasingly caused heartburn for the Trump 2024 campaign as they attempt to undo the self-sabotage by ramping up operations in key battleground states encouraging Republicans to vote early and by mail ahead of the presidential election.\n\nThe former US president has continued his crusade in recent months: in December he called for the end of mail-in voting entirely, before claiming in an interview last month that \u201cany time the mail is involved, you\u2019re going to have cheating\u201d.\n\nTrump\u2019s attacks are complicating efforts at the Trump campaign to convince Republicans to vote early, which advisers know is crucial to win the election given Democratic voters have no qualms about voting by mail or organizing ballot initiatives and have given their party a major advantage.\n\nJust 28% of Republicans support allowing any voter to cast a ballot by mail, compared with 84% of Democrats, according to a study in February by the Pew Research Center. A large part of that thinking, sources close to Trump concede, has been driven by the former president\u2019s criticism of early voting.\n\nThe problem has become multi-faceted, sources familiar with the situation say. The Trump campaign needs to convince Republicans who believe Trump\u2019s every word that they can discount his fearmongering, while ensuring they do not anger Trump by undercutting his position.\n\nIn essence, the Trump campaign has the delicate task of persuading Republican voters to participate in early voting methods that Trump has falsely said were the reason why there was rampant fraud in the 2020 election that meant he lost to Joe Biden.\n\nThe undertaking is made difficult by the fact that Trump\u2019s voters typically take him at his word. The fear instilled in them of early voting means that Trump and down-ballot Republican candidates are far more at the mercy of election day problems like bad weather, long lines or voting machine issues.\n\nAt the same time, Trump advisers are spending time trying to make sure they do not appear like they are trying to control the former president or are deliberately trying to undermine him \u2013 perceptions he particularly hates.\n\nThe internal concern at the campaign, the sources suggested, is not wanting to aggravate Trump could ultimately mean that efforts to push early voting and mail-in voting are not managed or pursued as aggressively by the top levels of the campaign for fear of incurring Trump\u2019s fury.\n\nA Trump spokesperson did not directly comment on Thursday but said Trump\u2019s position is that Republicans need to use early voting initiatives because Democrats are, even if in an ideal world, there would be no early voting for either party. The spokesperson added that Trump encouraged voters to turn out early in town-halls and video messages, especially during the Republican primaries.\n\nStill, Trump\u2019s logic on canceling mail-in voting has never been clear. If Democrats supposedly used mail-in voting to steal the election, it would make little sense to rail against the use of mail-in voting and convince Republicans to abandon the practice.\n\nThe available data on early voting, which was popular among Democrats and Republicans until the 2020 election, also shows that the practice is enormously effective and efficient for presidential campaigns in turning out their base.\n\nThe benefits of \u201cbanking\u201d votes are many: campaigns don\u2019t have to spend time and resources chasing their voters and reminding them to cast their ballot if they already have done so, freeing up resources, and ensuring high-propensity voters aren\u2019t lost due to unforeseen problems on election day.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Trump on Trial Free newsletter Stay up to date on all of Donald Trump\u2019s trials.

In the 2022 midterms, 2 million more Democrats than Republicans voted early in 24 states.\n\nIn both years, Republican candidates lost narrowly to Democratic opponents, including when the Republican candidate for Arizona governor, Kari Lake, lost to the Democratic candidate, Katie Hobbs, by about 17,000 votes. Meanwhile, about 19,000 more Democrats than Republicans voted by mail.\n\nTo undo the damage done by Trump, the campaign is ramping its efforts telling Maga voters to cast their ballot early through a blitz of television ads, door knocking and mailing flyers, among other initiatives including the RNC\u2019s Bank Your Vote program that was shelved then restarted.\n\nThe Trump campaign is also expected to rely on adjacent groups to help with get-out-the-vote measures. Turning Point USA, a far-right Trump group that slammed mail-in voting, recently created a $108m Chase the Vote program to convince Maga voters who trust the group to vote early.\n\nBut the pitch to Republican voters will always be hobbled by Trump\u2019s own remarks, one of the sources conceded, and may have to make the false argument that the only way to combat Democratic cheating is to cheat themselves \u2013 even if the premise of the argument itself was false.",

        "text": "With House speaker at his side, Trump suggests Ukraine aid should be loan\nAn inexperienced House speaker facing a brewing intraparty rebellion as he seeks bipartisan compromise to push through defense funding for Ukraine and Israel got a boost on Friday from the presumptive Republican party presidential nominee, Donald Trump.\n\n\n\n\"He's doing a really good job under very tough circumstances,\" Trump, at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, said at the start of a news conference with House Speaker Mike Johnson.\n\n\n\nTrump suggested Republicans push for making additional U.S. military aid to Ukraine \"in the form of a loan rather than a gift.\"\n\n\n\nJohnson, a Republican congressman from the state of Louisiana who has been House speaker since October, made no statement about the aid. But Trump's stance is likely to hold sway over many House Republicans.\n\n\n\nJohnson, according to Republican Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, has been negotiating with the White House about a package that would deviate from the Senate's $95 billion foreign security legislation.\n\n\n\nThe most contentious elements involve aid for Ukraine, locked in a defensive war against Russia, and for Israel, which has been on the offensive in Gaza against Hamas.\n\nJohnson's job in jeopardy\n\nJohnson, relatively unknown on the national stage when he emerged as a compromise candidate among Republicans to become House speaker, finds his job in jeopardy. Republicans are bitterly divided on further U.S. military aid for Ukraine.\n\n\"I'm not giving Ukraine any money, never have, never will,\" responded Representative Troy Nehls to a question from VOA's Ukrainian Service on Thursday. \"Can anybody tell me what the strategy is for Ukraine?\"\n\nNehls \u2014 who is among the Republican lawmakers who falsely assert the 2020 presidential election was \"rigged\" in favor of President Joe Biden \u2014 predicted if Trump is again elected president in November, Russian forces \"will be out of Ukraine by April 1st.\"\n\nAnother Republican in the House, Keith Self of the state of Texas, wants any support for Ukraine tied to increased funding for security at the U.S. Southern border with Mexico.\n\nSelf told VOA that while Kyiv awaits further aid from Washington, it should turn to European countries for help.\n\n\"I think Europe is starting to realize that they need to take care of their own backyard,\" said Self, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.\n\nIf Johnson is seen as acceding to the desires of Democrats, it would likely expand the number of Republican lawmakers dissatisfied with his leadership.\n\nJohnson is compelled to work with the Democrats on major legislation because his party retains a thin majority in the House.\n\nDemocrats disagree about Israel\n\nThe Democratic Party leader in the House, Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New Jersey, has suggested Democrats will help Johnson retain his position if the speaker helps push over the finish line the national security package sent by the Senate, where Democrats enjoy a majority, to the Republican-controlled House chamber.\n\nThe Democrats face their own disagreement over the bill, with some opposing sending offensive weaponry from the United States to Israel while it engages in its campaign in Gaza that, according to the Hamas-controlled health ministry, has killed more than 33,000 Palestinians.\n\n\"I'm looking at the possibility of a Ukraine-only [funding] bill\" to avoid further delays, Representative Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat from the state of Washington who is chair of the left-wing congressional progressive caucus, told VOA's Ukrainian Service.\n\nNot aiding Ukraine \"is malpractice on our part,\" according to Representative Madeleine Dean, who termed the hesitation among some lawmakers in both parties \"literally un-American\" and appeasing Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\"I can't tell you how strongly I feel about it, how upset and angry I am,\" the Pennsylvania Democrat added as she became emotional on the steps of the Capitol.\n\nThe task of reaching consensus in the House rests primarily on the shoulders of Johnson, a hard-right litigator who voted against certifying the 2020 presidential election. The Trump loyalist is the least experienced speaker in nearly a century and a half.\n\nJohnson's visit on Friday to Trump's Florida resort home was seen as an attempt by the weakened House speaker to be shored up by the former president. Trump's backing has been pivotal for top Republicans to stay in their positions or gain them.\n\nHis lack of support for the previously elected House speaker, Kevin McCarthy of California, and Republican National Committee Chair Ronna Romney McDaniel led to exits from their respective leadership jobs.\n\nKateryna Lisunova on Capitol Hill contributed to this report.",

        "text": "How Alex Garland's Civil War offers a warning about the US political divide\nHow Alex Garland's Civil War offers a warning about the US political divide\n\nA24\n\nA harrowing action film imagining a near future in which the US has descended into chaos is the year's most controversial film so far \u2013 and the polarised response is just as interesting.\n\nThe most harrowing, visceral scene among many in Alex Garland's Civil War takes place on the streets of Washington DC, which has become an intense combat zone. In a very near-future when seceding states are rebelling against the authoritarian US government, helicopters fly overhead and explosions hit the Lincoln Memorial. Near the White House, journalists hide from gunfire behind armoured military vehicles. Garland puts us in the centre of a stomach-churning fictional battle that feels all too real, especially in light of the real violence in the US Capitol on 6 January 2021.\n\nYet the heart of film is not in US politics. The dynamic plot, in fact, is more about journalists' important role as witnesses to war. Lee, a famous photojournalist (Kirsten Dunst), begins the film already looking exhausted from covering brutal conflicts. She and Joel (Wagner Moura), a reporter, hope to interview the president (Nick Offerman), who has disbanded the FBI and ordered the military to attack ordinary citizens. In response to his regime, rebellious states have formed different alliances, including the unlikely Texas-California partnership of the so-called Western Forces.\n\nA24 Civil War focuses on a group of journalists documenting the conflict, including newbie Jessie (Cailee Spaeny) (Credit: A24)\n\nAs these reporters travel through the war-torn country from New York to DC, Garland's point becomes clear. A young man at a gas station proudly shows Lee the writhing, bloodied bodies of two men he has hanged by their wrists. \"I went to high school with him,\" he says, pointing to one man. \"He didn't talk to me much.\" Men in unmarked combat gear shoot at snipers in a farmhouse. \"Someone's trying to kill us. We are trying to kill them,\" one of them tells Joel, who incredulously asks \"And you don't know what side they're fighting for?\" Shooting at the other side because it is the Other, killing because of xenophobia or just plain spite \u2013 that is the danger Civil War is about.\n\nGarland has made a brilliantly executed war movie that is anti-war, a political film determined to be apolitical in its details. Most of all it is a chilling, believable warning for the US and by extension countries around the world. \"It's a film about the product of polarisation and division,\" as Garland told CBS in one of many such comments. \"Unless we come to our senses, our polarised, divisive, non-communicative state is going to continue.\"\n\nGarland makes the future his protagonists travel through especially unsettling and close to home, because it so deftly combines the familiar and the strange\n\nTo convey that message, Garland creates an effective if too-neat array of generations. Sammy (Stephen McKinley Henderson) fills the slot of a sage elder reporter, who warns Lee and Joel, \"They shoot journalists on sight in the capitol. They consider us enemy combatants.\" Yet he joins them on the trip toward DC, hoping for one last go-round. Jessie (Cailee Spaeny) a talented young aspiring photojournalist who idolises Lee, talks her way into the car too, joining the increasingly dangerous trek.\n\nGarland makes the future they travel through especially unsettling and close to home, because it so deftly combines the familiar and the strange. Protesters on the streets of New York facing off against the New York Police Department is a recognizable scene, until the protestors are fired on by the US military. Lee and Joel's white van with Press written on the side is what is routinely seen by US viewers in news reports from foreign wars. And it can't be a coincidence that one scene is set at a Western Forces military base in Charlottesville, Virginia, site of a notorious 2017 white supremacist rally. The city's name itself now bristles with political division.\n\nMore like this\n\nGarland wrote Civil War in 2020, and has acknowledged on The Daily Show and elsewhere that the violence in the Washington scene resonates more strongly after the events of 6 January. In that same Daily Show interview, though, he emphasised that the film is not entirely about the US \u2013 that polarisation and ignoring journalists who point out the truth is happening in \"your country [US], my country [UK], many other countries\".\n\nA24 Civil War's imagery of a militarised US is deeply unsettling (Credit: A24)\n\nCivil War seems not only to speak to such deep societal dangers, but also to anticipate them, as Garland's films often do. His screenplay for Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later (2002) imagined a global plague years before Covid. That infection turned people into zombies, but still, it was a warning. A decade ago in the sleek Ex Machina, which he wrote and directed, he considered the thin line between artificial intelligence and sentient beings, taking a swipe at tech billionaires along the way.\n\nHis most perfectly realised film, Ex Machina holds up beautifully today. Garland has dismissed the idea that he is especially prescient, though, and said he is merely observing the world. Now he is observing polarisation, and the world seems ready to prove his point. Civil War itself began drawing sharply divided political reactions before anyone in the public had viewed it, mirroring the kind of division Garland depicts so explosively. The conversation around the film is almost as revealing as what is on screen.\n\nWhat the reaction to the film shows\n\nOne early article relied on a Reddit group, which the piece characterised as \"from the left side of the political spectrum\", grumbling that the yet-unseen film might incite violence. An even earlier piece reported how the film had inspired conspiracy theories from the right, alleging that it reflected a real-life plan by those in power to create disorder. The hair-on-fire anticipation echoes early fears about The Joker (2019), which never inspired the copycat violence predicted by the advance hand-wringing. But this polarised reaction indicates that Garland's timely film has really hit a nerve.\n\nAfter the film premiered at SXSW in March, he and the cast started doing interviews, emphasising its non-political stance, but not always clearing things up. Garland attempted to explain the baffling alliance between conservative-leaning Texas and liberal-leaning California, which is never addressed in the film. He told The Hollywood Reporter that the partnership says, \"Two sides that have a different political position have said, 'Our political differences are less important than this' [resisting a fascist president].\" After giving a similar answer to the Financial Times he added, \"To me that is such a small, logical step, but it's interesting that people find it so problematic.\"\n\nAt best, though, the concept of that alliance is wildly idealistic, and idealistic is not how this film lands. Near-realism is its strength, and showing such an unlikely collaboration doesn't serve that. Some recent polls suggest that Americans are united in their beliefs in the core values of democracy. However a study for the Carnegie Endowment goes beyond that. \"Even though Americans are not as ideologically polarised as they believe themselves to be, they are emotionally polarised (known as affective polarisation). In other words, they do not like members of the other party.\" In this notable instance, Garland doesn't help his own case by sidestepping how red v blue animosity seems to be at the root of the US divide.\n\nAlamy Garland's first film as screenwriter, 28 Days Later, showed his propensity for exploring perilous future scenarios (Credit: Alamy)\n\nThe actors have kept to their talking points. Offerman, asked on the red carpet before a preview screening if his character was based on Donald Trump, said no, that the character is \"unattached to anything in modern politics\". He's right insofar as the fictional president does not look or sound like any specific real-life person. On the same red carpet, Moura said: \"The film doesn't have a political agenda, you really cannot say that this is a liberal film, a conservative film.\" Similar comments, all true enough, go on and on through multiple cast interviews, bolstering the film's refusal to take sides.\n\nBut Garland himself has said the film is political, including during a Q&A panel after a New York screening this week. He flatly said he was getting annoyed that so many journalists said it was not. \"It's an intensely political film,\" he explained, but one that doesn't spell things out, with him providing \"dots that can be brought together\" and connected according to individual political opinions. \"This [fictional] president is a fascist,\" he noted, adding that he didn't know how many more dots anyone needed to go on.\n\nWhat seems political to Garland clearly does not mean the same to some of its critics, especially those who expected and might want more pointed commentary. But then those viewers really want Civil War to be a different film instead of the devastatingly real warning it is. It may have been written four years ago, but landing now in the midst of a tight US presidential election seems just the right time for a film that speaks so powerfully to a divided country, even if viewers have to connect the dots themselves.\n\nCivil War is out in US and UK cinemas on 12 April.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.",

        "text": "Trump Says He Has Enough Votes to \u201cCancel\u201d 2024 Presidential Election\nJust as he did in 2020, Trump has claimed without evidence that there will be \u201ccheating\u201d in the 2024 presidential race.\n\nDuring a recent speech at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, billed as a \u201cBorder 9/11 Gala,\u201d former President Donald Trump pushed a number of outright lies regarding the 2024 presidential election, claiming, without evidence, that fraud would affect its outcome.\n\nTrump\u2019s comments echoed assertions he made in the run-up to the 2020 presidential election, which laid the groundwork for him to errantly claim that the election was illegitimate when he lost to President Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to bring our country back. We\u2019re going to get out there. We\u2019re going to vote. We\u2019re going to watch the cheating very carefully,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump, the presumptive nominee for the 2024 Republican nomination for president, also pushed the 2020 \u201cBig Lie\u201d during the event, saying that Biden\u2019s campaign \u201ctook advantage of COVID last time\u201d to win, and that Trump\u2019s campaign wouldn\u2019t allow something \u201clike that [to] happen\u201d this year.\n\nTrump went on to say that his support was so monumental that the election could be canceled.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, if it\u2019s just by the vote, they could cancel that election. We win that election right now,\u201d Trump said at the event.\n\nIn the same breath, he continued to push election fraud conspiracy theories: \u201cWe have so many more votes than they do, but we have to be very vigilant. We have to be very careful,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump has consistently used his followers\u2019 willingness to accept falsehoods as truth to his political advantage. Some of his most recent, flagrantly false statements include:\n\nClaiming that Democrats support post-birth \u201cexecution\u201d of babies;\n\nSaying that immigrants will take people\u2019s Social Security benefits away;\n\nStating that the Biden administration directed state-based investigations into Trump\u2019s election interference in 2020;\n\nAnd continuing to claim that the 2020 presidential race \u201cwas a rigged election,\u201d despite no evidence supporting such assertions.\n\nAnti-Trump voices have become increasingly frustrated with the fact that Trump\u2019s disinformation is so effective among his base, and that the media has failed to showcase to a large segment of society that he is constantly lying. Experts have noted that there are numerous strategies to combat such disinformation, and that some of the best options require a \u201clong-game\u201d approach.\n\nSusan Stokes, a professor of political science at the University of Chicago, wrote in a Project Syndicate column last summer that repetition is an essential part of the equation.\n\n\u201cIt helps to keep hammering away at the facts, and to appeal to voters\u2019 capacity for critical thinking,\u201d Stokes wrote. \u201cTrump himself relies heavily on repetition, and Democrats should do the same, making clear again and again that his recklessness and self-centeredness have jeopardized national security and potentially exposed the American people to enormous harm.\u201d\n\nChristopher M. Richardson, an immigration lawyer and author, noted in a Los Angeles Times op-ed in February that Trump\u2019s lies \u2014 particularly regarding the unrest he inspired on January 6, and his attempts to depict those who took part as \u201chostages\u201d of the U.S. government \u2014 echo the revisionist history of the Civil War, commonly known as the Lost Cause movement. Looking to how Black Americans countered those narratives could be key to disrupting Trump\u2019s falsehoods, Richardson says:\n\nBy the 1920s [the Lost Cause] was widely considered factual. But it drew pushback from a group of Black scholars who started what was then called Negro History Week, which grew into February\u2019s Black History Month. Those educators had to combat one of our nation\u2019s first campaigns of disinformation.\n\nAlthough these scholars\u2019 efforts were not 100 percent effective, the lies peddled by Lost Cause supporters \u201care not nearly as unchallenged as they were when Negro History Week started,\u201d Richardson continued.\n\nThe strategy employed by these Black history scholars included teaching elementary school children factual accounts of history, as well as organizing older groups of people who were receptive to their message, including other historians and progressive media, so that accurate information was disseminated in \u201csafe and educational environments.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat has some resonance today. Arguing on X/Twitter against MAGA zealots stuck in a new Lost Cause narrative can be of little to no use,\u201d Richardson adds. \u201cThere may be more value in sharing knowledge of American democratic institutions\u2026with young students and other open-minded or pro-democracy individuals. The endurance of Black History Month suggests that approach can build a lasting foundation for myth-busting education.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to Truthout about how to combat Trump\u2019s disinformation, Donald Nieman, a history professor at Binghamton University with an emphasis in U.S. law and politics, noted:\n\nWe need the fact-checkers, and we need the people who are challenging the lies, if only to inject sanity and seriousness into our political discourse. But what works better than trying to dispel Trump\u2019s lies is to relentlessly point out that his positions on abortion, taxes, social security, climate change are deeply unpopular and/or benefit the rich at the expense of the middle class.\n\n\u201cHammering away at his role in January 6 and the attacks on democracy and the police is another way to get the relatively few swing voters there are to understand what\u2019s at stake,\u201d Nieman added.\n\nStephanie Pappas, a freelance science journalist, stressed in Scientific American in April 2023 that trying to appeal to Trump loyalists\u2019 logic or emotions doesn\u2019t work. The best way to counter Trump-like conspiracy theorists, Pappas said, is through prevention (by \u201cinoculating\u201d people with information to counter falsehoods spouted by deceitful politicians before they became relevant) and education.\n\n\u201cPutting people into an analytic mindset and explicitly teaching them how to evaluate information appears most protective against conspiracy rabbit holes,\u201d Pappas added.\n\nTruthout Is Preparing to Meet Trump\u2019s Agenda With Resistance at Every Turn Dear Truthout Community, If you feel rage, despondency, confusion and deep fear today, you are not alone. We\u2019re feeling it too. We are heartsick. Facing down Trump\u2019s fascist agenda, we are desperately worried about the most vulnerable people among us, including our loved ones and everyone in the Truthout community, and our minds are racing a million miles a minute to try to map out all that needs to be done. We must give ourselves space to grieve and feel our fear, feel our rage, and keep in the forefront of our mind the stark truth that millions of real human lives are on the line. And simultaneously, we\u2019ve got to get to work, take stock of our resources, and prepare to throw ourselves full force into the movement. Journalism is a linchpin of that movement. Even as we are reeling, we\u2019re summoning up all the energy we can to face down what\u2019s coming, because we know that one of the sharpest weapons against fascism is publishing the truth. There are many terrifying planks to the Trump agenda, and we plan to devote ourselves to reporting thoroughly on each one and, crucially, covering the movements resisting them. We also recognize that Trump is a dire threat to journalism itself, and that we must take this seriously from the outset. After the election, the four of us sat down to have some hard but necessary conversations about Truthout under a Trump presidency. How would we defend our publication from an avalanche of far right lawsuits that seek to bankrupt us? How would we keep our reporters safe if they need to cover outbreaks of political violence, or if they are targeted by authorities? How will we urgently produce the practical analysis, tools and movement coverage that you need right now \u2014 breaking through our normal routines to meet a terrifying moment in ways that best serve you? It will be a tough, scary four years to produce social justice-driven journalism. We need to deliver news, strategy, liberatory ideas, tools and movement-sparking solutions with a force that we never have had to before. And at the same time, we desperately need to protect our ability to do so. We know this is such a painful moment and donations may understandably be the last thing on your mind. But we must ask for your support, which is needed in a new and urgent way. We promise we will kick into an even higher gear to give you truthful news that cuts against the disinformation and vitriol and hate and violence. We promise to publish analyses that will serve the needs of the movements we all rely on to survive the next four years, and even build for the future. We promise to be responsive, to recognize you as members of our community with a vital stake and voice in this work. Please dig deep if you can, but a donation of any amount will be a truly meaningful and tangible action in this cataclysmic historical moment. We\u2019re with you. Let\u2019s do all we can to move forward together. With love, rage, and solidarity, Maya, Negin, Saima, and Ziggy\n\nThis article is licensed under Creative Commons (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0), and you are free to share and republish under the terms of the license.",

The Board\u2019s decision was taken by consensus.\n\nIn line with the selection process it had established on March 13, 2024 (See Press Release No. 24/86), the Board held several discussions, including with Ms. Georgieva, the sole candidate nominated for the position, before making its decision today. Following today\u2019s meeting, the Coordinators of the Executive Board, Mr. Afonso S. Bevilaqua and Mr. Abdullah F. BinZarah, made the following statement:\n\n\u201cIn taking this decision, the Board commended Ms. Georgieva\u2019s strong and agile leadership during her term, navigating a series of major global shocks. Ms. Georgieva led the IMF\u2019s unprecedented response to these shocks, including the approval of more than $360 billion in new financing since the start of the pandemic for 97 countries, debt service relief to the Fund\u2019s poorest, most vulnerable members, and a historic Special Drawing Rights (SDR) allocation equivalent to $650 billion. Under her leadership, the Fund introduced innovative new financing facilities, including the Resilience and Sustainability Facility and the Food Shock Window. It replenished the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust, with the capacity to mobilize concessional loans to its poorest members, and co-created the Global Sovereign Debt Roundtable. It also secured a 50 percent quota increase to bolster the Fund\u2019s permanent resources and agreed to add a third Sub-Saharan African chair to the IMF Board.\n\n\u201cLooking ahead, the Board welcomes Ms. Georgieva\u2019s ongoing emphasis on issues of macroeconomic and financial stability, while also ensuring that the Fund continues to adapt and evolve to meet the needs of its entire membership. It recognizes her focus on strengthening the Fund\u2019s support to its members through effective policy advice, capacity development and financing. The Board looks forward to continuing to work closely with the Managing Director.\u201d\n\nBackground:\n\nMs. Georgieva has served as Managing Director since October 1, 2019 (See Press Release No. 19/351). The Managing Director is the chief of the IMF\u2019s operating staff and Chair of the Executive Board. The Managing Director is assisted by four Deputy Managing Directors in overseeing the Fund\u2019s operations, which serve its membership through about 3,100 staff.\n\nMs. Georgieva, a national of Bulgaria, has been the IMF\u2019s Managing Director since 2019. Previously she served as Chief Executive Officer of the World Bank from January 2017. From February 1, 2019, to April 8, 2019, she was the Interim President for the World Bank Group. She previously served at the European Commission as Commissioner for International Cooperation, Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Response, and as Vice President for Budget and Human Resources. Ms. Georgieva has a Ph.D. in Economic Science and a M.A. in Political Economy and Sociology from the University of National and World Economy in Bulgaria, where she also taught from 1977 to 1991.\n\nMs. Georgieva\u2019s Bio\n\nKristalina Georgieva (imf.org)\n\nFactsheet on Selection Process for IMF Managing Director\n\nhttps://www.imf.org/en/About/Factsheets/Sheets/2022/MD-selection-process\n\nQ&A on Managing Director (MD) Selection\n\nhttps://www.imf.org/en/About/Factsheets/Sheets/2022/MD-selection-process/qandas",

        "text": "Biden Shrinks Trump\u2019s Edge in Latest Times/Siena Poll\nPresident Biden has nearly erased Donald J. Trump\u2019s early polling advantage, amid signs that the Democratic base has begun to coalesce behind the president despite lingering doubts about the direction of the country, the economy and his age, according to a new survey by The New York Times and Siena College.\n\nMr. Biden and Mr. Trump are now virtually tied, with Mr. Trump holding a 46 percent to 45 percent edge. That is an improvement for Mr. Biden from late February, when Mr. Trump had a sturdier 48 percent to 43 percent lead just before he became the presumptive Republican nominee.\n\nMr. Biden\u2019s tick upward appears to stem largely from his improved standing among traditional Democratic voters \u2014 he is winning a greater share of voters who supported him in 2020 than he did a month ago. Then, Mr. Trump had secured the support of far more of his past voters compared with the president \u2014 97 percent to 83 percent \u2014 but that margin has narrowed. Mr. Biden is now winning 89 percent of his 2020 supporters compared with 94 percent for Mr. Trump.\n\nThe tightening poll results are the latest evidence of a 2024 contest that both campaigns are preparing to be excruciatingly close. The last two presidential elections were decided by tens of thousands of votes in a handful of battleground states, and this one could be just as tight. In a nation so evenly divided, even the tiniest of shifts in support could prove decisive.",

        "text": "Trump boasts \u2018We broke Roe v Wade\u2019 as abortion dogs GOP election hopes\nFacing the press alongside the House speaker, fellow Republican Mike Johnson, Donald Trump bragged: \u201cWe broke Roe v Wade.\u201d\n\nThe former president made the stark admission about his dominant role in attacks on abortion rights at the end of a week in which the rightwing Arizona state supreme court ruled that an 1864 law imposing a near-total ban could go back into effect.\n\nAbortion rights were removed at the federal level in 2022 when a US supreme court to which Trump appointed three justices overturned Roe, which had stood since 1973. The issue has fueled Democratic wins at the ballot box ever since. This week, the Arizona ruling sent Republicans scrambling to minimise damage.\n\nTrump repeated his contention that the issue should rest with the states and there is no need for a national ban, a demand of the US\u2019s political right. But he could not resist a boast on which his opponents are sure to seize.\n\n\u201cWe broke Roe v Wade,\u201d Trump said. \u201cNobody thought was possible. We gave it back to the states and the states are working very brilliantly, in some cases conservative, in some cases not conservative, but they\u2019re working. And it\u2019s working the way it\u2019s supposed to.\n\n\u201cEvery \u2026 real legal scholar wanted to have it go back to the states,\u201d Trump claimed without offering evidence. \u201cDemocrat, Republican, liberal, conservative. And we were able to do that \u2026 and now the states are working their way through it.\n\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re gonna, you\u2019re having some very, very beautiful harmony, to be honest with you. You have, well, you have some cases like Arizona that went back to like 1864 or something like that. And a judge made a ruling, but that\u2019s going to be changed by government. They\u2019re going to be changing that. I disagree with that.\u201d\n\nAt the time of Trump\u2019s remarks, the vice-president, Kamala Harris, was speaking in Arizona, hammering home Democratic attacks on Republican threats to reproductive rights. Her key message: Trump is to blame.\n\n\u201cAnd just minutes ago, standing beside Speaker Johnson, Donald Trump just said the collection of state bans is, quote: \u2018working the way it is supposed to\u2019,\u201d Harris said. \u201cAnd as much harm as he has already caused, a second Trump term would be even worse.\u201d\n\nTrump and Johnson appeared together at a time of intense legal jeopardy for the former president and great political danger for the House speaker that meant their intended message \u2013 a supposed need to focus on the canard of \u201celection integrity\u201d \u2013 seemed guaranteed to be drowned out.\n\nIn New York on Monday, Trump will face trial on 34 of 88 pending criminal charges. The first ever criminal trial involving a former president will concern hush-money payments to an adult film star who claimed an affair.\n\nIn Washington, Johnson must manage Congress with a tiny majority under pressure from an unruly Republican House caucus dominated by the pro-Trump right. The Georgia extremist Marjorie Taylor Greene has filed a motion to remove him.\n\nOpening the press conference at his Mar-a-Lago home, Trump exhibited his signature rhetoric on immigration, increasingly dehumanizing and vicious.\n\nView image in fullscreen The speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, looks on as Donald Trump addresses the press at Mar-a-Lago. Photograph: Wilfredo Lee/AP\n\nJohnson said Republicans would seek to introduce legislation to \u201crequire proof of citizenship to vote\u201d, claiming that if \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d of migrants cast votes, it could affect the result of the elections.\n\nIn reality, non-citizens voting is not even close to a problem.\n\nSome cities allow non-citizens to vote in municipal and non-federal polls. But non-citizen voting in federal elections is already illegal under a 1996 law. Offenders can be fined and jailed for up to a year. Deportation is possible.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Thing Free daily newsletter Our US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His legal work failed but even after the deadly January 6 attack on Congress by Trump supporters in early 2021, he was among 147 Republicans who voted to object to results in Pennsylvania and Arizona.\n\nOn Friday, a statement released by the Trump campaign said Johnson had \u201cagreed to hold a series of public committee hearings over the next two months \u2026 in advance of potential legislation to further safeguard our elections from interference\u201d.\n\nSubjects of supposed concern included \u201cmail-in voting processes and mail-ballot handling\u201d, \u201cvoter registration list maintenance and how states will \u2026 prevent illegal immigrants and noncitizens from voting in the 2024 presidential election\u201d; and \u201cgeneral preparations\u201d for Trump\u2019s rematch with Biden.\n\nReporters raised other issues that have roiled Republican politics. Earlier, in Washington, Johnson oversaw passage of a bill to reauthorise the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or Fisa, including a key measure that allows for warrantless surveillance of American citizens. Trump and allies opposed the renewal, arising from his complaints about investigations of Russian election interference on his behalf in the 2016 race that sent him to the White House.\n\nAsked about the House bill, Trump said he still didn\u2019t like Fisa and repeated his complaints about 2016. Johnson nodded behind him.\n\nTrump also opposes new aid for Ukraine, passed by the Senate but held up in the House. Johnson has said he wants to pass aid for Ukraine \u2013 but that could cause his downfall.\n\nAt Mar-a-Lago, Trump kept the subject at arm\u2019s length, verbally abusing Biden and claiming conflicts around the world would not have happened on his watch.\n\nHe also castigated those prosecuting him criminally, including in the hush-money trial due to start in New York on Monday, over which he also complained about the judge. He was, he said, \u201cabsolutely\u201d willing to testify in his own defence.",

        "text": "RFK Jr. says he has ruled out Libertarian run for president\nThis is a shift from his prior stance of keeping the door open.\n\nRFK Jr. says he has ruled out Libertarian run for president\n\nWEST DES MOINES, Iowa -- Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has ruled out a run as a Libertarian candidate to assist in his efforts to get on the ballots in all 50 states -- a marked change from his prior posture, where he kept the door open.\n\n\"We're not gonna have any problems getting on the ballot ourselves so we won't be running Libertarian,\" he told ABC News.\n\nKennedy spoke from West Des Moines, Iowa, where his campaign was taking a victory lap, touting their Saturday afternoon gambit to get on to the general election ballot in Iowa through a quirk in state law as a rollicking success. Its plan was to hold a small, one- day convention in West Des Moines with at least 500 eligible voters, who must hail from at least 25 of the state's 99 counties.\n\nThe campaign says they surpassed that benchmark -- with a member of his team claiming it accrued 686 credentialed delegates representing more than 35 counties in Iowa.\n\nThe results have yet to be certified by the Iowa secretary of state's office.\n\nIndependent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. attends a Cesar Chavez Day event at Union Station on March 30, 2024, in Los Angeles. Mario Tama/Getty Images\n\nDuring the interview with ABC News prior to his assembly Saturday, Kennedy said he found a single day event \"easier\" than amassing the 3,500 signatures needed to gain independent access via petition.\n\nAnd he said \"100% confident\" he can replicate these results in all 50 states, despite encountering concurring roadblocks to getting on the ballot across the country.\n\n\"We're going to add probably two to three states a week,\" Kennedy said.\n\nThe independent candidate running on a We the People Party ticket seemed confident he needs little to no outside help, telling ABC News he doesn't plan to join the Libertarian Party to assist in his efforts to get on the ballots.\n\nLibertarian Party Chair Angela McArdle said she would not comment for \"at least a few days.\" Kennedy, who onetheless still faces a grueling ballot access effort as an independent, had publicly been keeping open the option of vying to lead the Libertarian ticket, which would ensure him ballot access everywhere.\n\nRecently, the group voiced concerns about Kennedy's vice presidential pick.\n\nAnd Kennedy wouldn't commit to ducking out of the race if he's unable to reach the 33% threshold he claims he needs to win come November, even if he's faced with less than desirable results come convention time.\n\n\"I expect to win. And you should ask that question of President [Joe] Biden,\" he said.\n\nAs for his reaction to a New York Times/Siena College poll that placed him at 2%, Kennedy claimed without evidence that the Times deliberately skewed their polling methodology to diminish his candidacy: \"And I leave it to you to speculate as to why the New York Times would do that.\"\n\nHe even brought it up later when he first took the stage for his public remarks.\n\nKennedy responded to the news of Iran's retaliatory strike against Israel, telling reporters \"the U.S. ought to be bending over backwards to protect Israel,\" but he said he does not believe U.S. ground troops should be deployed to Israel.\n\n\"It's our oldest ally and I think the U.S. ought to be bending over backwards to protect Israel. I think the Ppresident also has to do everything in his power to de-escalate this crisis,\" Kennedy said.\n\n\"Israel has never asked us in its history for soldiers and, no, I don't think they should be there,\" he said.\n\nFormer Biden voter Steven Bailey, of Des Moines, said he'd like to see a debate between Kennedy, Biden and former President Donald Trump.\n\nBut Bailey played down claims, pushed by Democrats, that Kennedy could spoil the race by siphoning off just enough voters from Biden to help Trump.\n\n\"It\u2019s not about pulling from the right or the left. It's about who's the best man for the job, who's competent, who has better ideas, who's greater?\" Bailey said. \"And if that is RFK, vote for him.\"\n\nMarsha Kendall, another Iowa voter, said she was drawn to Kennedy because of his focus on environmental issues and previously voted for Trump.\n\n\"He'll be my candidate. Otherwise, you know, I may not vote,\" she said. \"I don\u2019t know.\"\n\nNicole Shanahan, President of Bia-Echo Foundation, attends Gold House's Inaugural Gold Gala: A New Gold Age at Vibiana, May 21, 2022, in Los Angeles. Gonzalo Marroquin/Getty Images for Gold House, FILE\n\nNoticeably missing from the event was Kennedy's newly minted vice presidential pick, Silicon Valley attorney Nicole Shanahan.\n\nWhen pressed to explain her absence by ABC, Kennedy said she couldn't make it due to a visit to the country's southern border earlier this week as well as spending time with her daughter but maintained that the two are a \"united front.\"\n\n\"She has been at the border all week, and I think today is the day that she had her daughter. She couldn't come on this trip, but we're going to be doing a lot of events together in the next couple of weeks,\" he said.\n\n\"We are a unified front. I'm very proud of her, I'm very proud of what she's doing,\" he said.\n\n\"I talk to Nicole probably two, three times a day,\" he said, \"and I'm very proud of the stuff she's been doing and I look forward to appearing with her in places.\"",

        "text": "Fact checking Trump's claims about 'election integrity'\nTrump has continued to falsely claim he won the 2020 election in several states.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump and Speaker Mike Johnson have a joint appearance at Mar-a-Lago Friday afternoon where they are discussing \"election integrity.\"\n\nThe topic is a chief priority for Trump, the presumptive GOP nominee, who continues to falsely claim that he won the 2020 election. Trump's calls for \"election integrity\" come in an election year when there is expected to be another tight matchup against President Joe Biden.\n\nJohnson has echoed Trump's calls for \"election integrity\" and was one of the 147 GOP lawmakers who voted to overturn the results of the 2020 election. He also led the charge to get 125 of his Republican colleagues to sign an amicus brief to the Supreme Court, supporting Texas' lawsuit that would have invalidated the election results in key battleground states.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign event in Grand Rapids, MI, April 2, 2024. Paul Sancya/AP\n\nABC News is fact checking some of Trump's previous and false comments on elections and voting ahead of the joint appearance with Johnson.\n\nState and federal courts have dismissed more than 50 lawsuits across six states from Trump and his allies aiming to overturn the results of the 2020 election. In many of the cases, Trump pushed thinly supported allegations of election misconduct and fraud.\n\nAn Associated Press investigation found fewer than 475 cases of voter fraud in six battleground states during the 2020 presidential election -- a number far too little to have make any different in the outcome of that election. Arizona had the highest number of potential fraud cases of the states AP examined with 198 of the 3.4 million votes cast -- and that amount of potential fraud cases comprised less than 2% of the margin by which Biden won, according to the AP. In Nevada, the AP found that local officials identified between 93 and 98 potential fraud cases out of 1.4 million ballots cast, representing less than one-third of 1% of Biden\u2019s margin of victory.\n\nTrump has continued to falsely claim he won the 2020 election in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, but he lost all three of those states in the last presidential election. In Pennsylvania, Biden won by 81,660; in Michigan, Biden won by about 21,000 votes; in Wisconsin, Biden won by more than 20,000.\n\nThe United States National Intelligence Council, comprised of the United States' intelligence and security agencies, announced in 2021 that it found \"no indications that any foreign actor attempted to alter any technical aspect of the voting process in the 2020 elections.\"\n\nTrump has also criticized voting methods.\n\nTrump routinely disparages mail-in voting and has made unfounded claims about the process which he claims, in part, led to his 2020 election loss. Despite his repeated claims about mail-in vote fraud, no widespread fraud has been found. A Washington Post analysis of data collected by three vote-by-mail states with help from the nonprofit Electronic Registration Information Center found that there were 372 possible cases of double voting or voting on behalf of deceased people out of about 14.6 million votes cast by mail in the 2016 and 2018 general elections. That comes out to 0.0025%.\n\n\"Mail-in voting is totally corrupt. Get that through your head. It has to be,\" Trump said at a rally in Michigan in February, repeating unfounded claims about mail-in voting.\n\nTrump has also continued to float claims against voting machines, pushing for paper ballots instead.\n\n\"I will secure our elections. We are going to secure our elections. Our goal will be one-day voting with paper ballots -- very simple -- and a voter ID, but until then, Republicans must win. Landslide. We want it to be too big, too big to rig,\" Trump said at an April 2 rally in Wisconsin, where he continued to falsely claim he won the state in 2020.\n\nHowever, the vast majority of Americans already vote with hand-marked paper ballots or on touch-screen machines that print one.\n\nResidents of Lansing, Michigan, cast their votes Nov. 3, 2020. Seth Herald/AFP via Getty Images\n\nTrump and his allies have claimed that Democrats are \"importing voters\" to allow non-U.S. citizens participate in the U.S. elections.\n\n\"That's why they are allowing these people to come in -- people that don't speak our language -- they are signing them up to vote,\" Trump said at a January rally in Iowa.\n\nWhile election officials and law enforcement authorities have found cases of non-citizens voting or attempting to vote over the years -- either by mistake or with malicious intent -- it has not been enough to affect the any outcome of an election, the Washington Post reported.\n\nPolitiFact reported that it has found no effort by Democrats to register people in the country illegally.\n\n\"Most noncitizens don't want to risk jail time (or deportation if they are here illegally) by casting a ballot. Election officials take several steps to ensure that only eligible voters cast ballots,\" PolitiFact reported.\n\nIn Georgia, for example, the attorney general's office announced in 2022 that the state had found a total of 1,634 cases of potential noncitizens registering to vote in the state since 1997 -- none of whom were permitted to vote.",

        "text": "South Africa\u2019s election body asks top court to resolve Zuma candidacy\nFormer President Jacob Zuma hopes to run for office for the opposition uMkhonto weSizwe Party (MK) in May elections.\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s electoral commission said it has appealed to the country\u2019s highest court to rule on whether former President Jacob Zuma can stand as a candidate in general elections in May.\n\nThe commission said in a statement on Friday that it had lodged an \u201curgent and direct\u201d appeal to the Constitutional Court to provide \u201ccertainty\u201d on the proper interpretation of the constitutional article relating to candidacies of people who have been convicted.\n\n\u201cSuch clarity is important in the present matter because of a live issue but also for future elections,\u201d it said.\n\nThe appeal is the latest twist in a legal wrangle over the eligibility of the 81-year-old politician, after an electoral court ruled this week that Zuma could run for office, overturning an earlier decision that had barred him from contesting.\n\nZuma is hoping to run for president on behalf of the uMkhonto weSizwe Party (MK), which he joined last year after denouncing the governing African National Congress (ANC) party that he once led.\n\nOn May 29, South Africans will head to the polls to elect 400 members of the General Assembly. A month later, lawmakers in the new parliament will choose the next president.\n\nBanking on the popularity of Zuma, MK hopes to win enough votes that would ensure them parliament seats, while also cutting into the vote share of the ANC.\n\nThe ANC could see its vote share drop below 50 percent for the first time since 1994. Short of a parliamentary majority, it would be forced to seek coalition partners to remain in power, turning Zuma into a possible kingmaker, analysts say.\n\nSome opinion polls suggested MK at above 10 percent nationwide, a share that would make it the third or fourth political force behind the ANC and the liberal Democratic Alliance.\n\nThe party is projected to make a particularly strong showing in the battleground region of KwaZulu-Natal \u2013 Zuma\u2019s home province.\n\nIt largely relies on the considerable political clout still wielded by Zuma, who despite scandals and corruption allegations is popular, particularly among the country\u2019s more than 10 million Zulus.\n\nThe electoral commission had disqualified Zuma, saying the constitution bars anyone sentenced to more than 12 months\u2019 imprisonment.\n\nZuma was sentenced to 15 months in jail in June 2021 after refusing to testify to a panel investigating financial corruption and cronyism during his presidency.\n\nHis lawyers argued the sentence did not disqualify him as it followed civil rather than criminal proceedings and it had been shortened by a remission.\n\nZuma was freed on medical parole just two months into his jail term.\n\nThe commission stressed that the appeal \u201cis not intended to involve itself in the political field of play\u201d rather to ensure a \u201cfree and fair\u201d electoral process.",

U.S. officials have recorded more than 150 attacks by Iran-backed militias in Iraq and Syria on U.S. forces at bases in those countries since war started on Oct. 7.\n\nOne attack in late January killed three U.S. service members in Jordan. In retaliation, the U.S. launched a massive air assault, hitting more than 85 targets at seven locations in Iraq and Syria.\n\nMeantime, on Saturday, commandos from Iran\u2019s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard rappelled from a helicopter onto an Israeli-affiliated container ship near the Strait of Hormuz and seized the vessel.\n\nWatson, the NSC spokesperson, said the U.S. strongly condemned the seizure and urged Iran to release the ship and crew immediately.\n\n\u201cWe will work with our partners to hold Iran to account for its actions,\u201d she said.\n\nAlso Saturday, the Israeli-occupied West Bank also saw some of the worst violence since Hamas\u2019 attack on Israel.\n\nPrice reported from Rehoboth Beach, Delaware.

        "text": "News organizations urge Biden and Trump to commit to presidential debates during the 2024 campaign\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Twelve news organizations on Sunday urged presumptive presidential nominees Joe Biden and Donald Trump to agree to debates, saying they were a \u201crich tradition\u201d that have been part of every general election campaign since 1976.\n\nWhile Trump, who did not participate in debates for the Republican nomination, has indicated a willingness to take on his 2020 rival, the Democratic president has not committed to debating him again.\n\nAlthough invitations have not been formally issued, the news organizations said it was not too early for each campaign to say publicly that it will participate in the three presidential and one vice presidential forums set by the nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates.\n\n\u201cIf there is one thing Americans can agree on during this polarized time, it is that the stakes of this election are exceptionally high,\u201d the organizations said in a joint statement. \u201cAmidst that backdrop, there is simply no substitute for the candidates debating with each other, and before the American people, their visions for the future of our nation.\u201d\n\nABC, CBS, CNN, Fox, PBS, NBC, NPR and The Associated Press all signed on to the letter.\n\nBiden and Trump debated twice in 2020. A third debate was canceled after Trump, then president, tested positive for COVID-19 and would not debate remotely.\n\nWhat to know about Trump\u2019s second term:\n\nStaffing the administration: Here are the people Trump has picked recess appointments Follow all of our coverage as Donald Trump assembles his second administration.\n\nAsked on March 8 whether he would commit to a debate with Trump, Biden said, \u201cit depends on his behavior.\u201d The president was visibly miffed by his opponent in the freewheeling first 2020 debate, at one point saying, \u201cwill you shut up?\u201d\n\nTrump campaign managers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita said in a letter this past week that \u201cwe have already indicated President Trump is willing to debate anytime, any place and anywhere \u2014 and the time to start these debates is now.\u201d\n\nThey cited the seven 1858 Illinois Senate debates between Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas, saying \u201ccertainly today\u2019s America deserves as much.\u201d\n\nThe Republican National Committee voted in 2022 to no longer participate in forums sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. The Trump campaign has not indicated it would adhere to that, but did have some conditions. The campaign managers said the commission selected a \u201cdemonstrably anti-Trump moderator\u201d in then-Fox News host Chris Wallace in 2020 and wants assurances the commission debates are fair and impartial.\n\nThe Trump campaign also wants the timetable moved up, saying that many Americans will have already voted by Sept. 16, Oct. 1 and Oct. 9, the dates of the three debates set by the commission.\n\nThe Biden campaign declined comment on the news organizations\u2019 letter, pointing to the president\u2019s earlier statement. There was no immediate response from the Trump campaign.\n\nBut on Saturday, Trump held a rally in northeast Pennsylvania with two lecterns set up on the stage: one for him to give a speech, the other to symbolize what he said was Biden\u2019s refusal to debate him. The second lectern had a placard that read, \u201cAnytime. Anywhere. Anyplace.\u201d\n\nMidway through his campaign speech, Trump turned to his right and pointed to the second lectern.\n\n\u201cWe have a little, look at this, it\u2019s for him,\u201d he said. \u201cSee the podium? I\u2019m calling on Crooked Joe Biden to debate anytime, anywhere, any place. Right there. And we have to debate because our country is going in the wrong direction so badly and while it\u2019s a little bit typically early we have to debate. We have to explain to the American people what the hell is going on,\u201d Trump said.\n\nC-SPAN, NewsNation and Univision also joined the letter calling for debates. Only one newspaper, USA Today, added its voice. The Washington Post declined a request to join.\n\nCertainly the broadcasters could use the juice that debates may bring. Television news ratings are down significantly compared with the 2020 campaign, although there are other factors involved, such as cord-cutting and the pandemic, that increased interest in news four years ago.\n\nThere were no Democratic debates this presidential cycle, and Trump\u2019s refusal to participate in the GOP forums depressed interest in them.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Josh Boak in Schnecksville, Pennsylvania, contributed to this report.",

Here's what it can tell us about 2024\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post via Getty Images Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post via Getty Images\n\nERIE, Pa. - On a recent weeknight in Erie, Pa., the local minor league hockey team hosted a playoff game for the first time in years. The home team Erie Otters faced off against the Kitchener Rangers from Ontario, Canada.\n\nBut even as fans watched the action on the ice, another kind of face-off isn't far from the minds of Erie County residents.\n\n\"You go down different blocks or different streets and you see something, you know, Trump or Biden,\" said 34-year-old Bekah Mook, who was at the game. \"You can't even have a glass of beer unless something is mentioned Democrat or Republican.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"It's everywhere you turn,\" she said.\n\nWhile most counties across the country predictably lean Democrat or Republican, Erie County, in the northwest corner of Pennsylvania, is what election watchers call a \"boomerang county.\" It boomeranged from Democrats to Republicans and back in recent presidential election cycles.\n\nThe county went for former President Barack Obama twice, then former President Donald Trump in 2016, and narrowly for President Biden in 2020.\n\nNow everyone is trying to predict what will happen this year.\n\n'How Erie goes, Pennsylvania goes'\n\nBiden won Erie County in 2020 by less than 1,500 votes, or 1.03 percentage points. In 2016, the margin was less than 2,000 votes for Trump.\n\nMook, who works in a mental health practice, is one of those voters who flipped. She comes from a family of Christian Republicans, and once considered herself solidly in that camp. She supported Trump in 2016, largely due to her opposition to abortion.\n\nBut her feelings changed as she watched Trump in office.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Don Gonyea/NPR Don Gonyea/NPR\n\n\"Now I'm looking at everything else. And there are so many more issues than just abortion,\" she said.\n\nOne thing that particularly bothered her was Trump's policy of separating migrant families at the U.S.-Mexico border, and the images of children being kept in detention at border facilities.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"I have 19 nieces and nephews, no kids right now, and I'm just a kid person,\" Mook said. \"So when I see kids like that I'm just like, 'Oh, that's disgusting.'\"\n\nAs for this year, Mook says she's still going back and forth with her presidential vote. She's currently leaning \"60% Democratic.\" Another Erie County voter at the arena that night, 22-year-old Ethan Haynes, says he's an independent, but this year he's all in for Biden. For him, democracy is on the ballot.\n\n\"I think that with Trump and his messaging has very much shown that he is unwilling to give up power if he gets it again,\" Haynes said.\n\nHead out to the more rural parts of the county, outside the city of Erie, and you find a much more conservative type of voter. After finishing his breakfast at a classic old diner in Girard, Pa., 66-year-old Tim Stevenson said he'll be backing Trump.\n\n\"We can't go through another four years of Joe Biden,\" said Stevenson, a retired township police officer who now runs an auto repair shop. \"I don't think he has the capability to run an ice cream stand.\"\n\nIt's all about turnout\n\nThe local political party chairmen in Erie have long histories in the county, and both know that this place could be pivotal in November.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Don Gonyea/NPR Don Gonyea/NPR\n\n\"Erie County actually mimics the state very closely demographically,\" explained Sam Talarico, the Erie County Democratic Party chair.\n\n\"We have an urban core, we have suburban areas. And if you go south of Interstate 90, it's rural,\" he said. \"So that's why we're kind of a bellwether county. We see how Erie goes, Pennsylvania goes. And that's that's been true in the last few elections.\"\n\nTalarico says his job this year is to drive turnout. That means the grunt work of campaigning: door knocking, phone banking and voter registration drives.\n\n\"I think most people have already made up their minds because both of these candidates have been in the White House and they know who they are,\" he explained.\n\n\"So our real challenge is to find new voters and, you know, hopefully get them on our side,\" Talarico said.\n\nMail-in voting might make the difference\n\nAcross town at the local Republican Party headquarters, county Chair Tom Eddy has a different goal: getting more Republicans to vote by mail.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nDemocrats currently have a massive advantage when it comes to mail-in ballots. While Biden won Erie by just over a single percentage point in 2020, he won 75% of the county's mail-in ballots. The same dynamic played out for Democrats in the 2022 midterms and 2023 state judicial elections.\n\nThat's a big problem for the GOP. Eddy puts it in very blunt terms, saying Republicans have been losing elections they could have won because voters in his party don't believe in mail-in balloting.\n\nThat rejection of a type of voting that is legal and in wide use in the state comes in large part because the practice has been loudly vilified by Trump, who has repeatedly lied and called it a major source of voter fraud, falsely citing mail-in voting as a cause of his 2020 defeat. There is no evidence of any such problems with mail-in ballots.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Don Gonyea/NPR Don Gonyea/NPR\n\nEddy, without himself completely dismissing or dispelling the incorrect claims of mail-in ballot fraud, does insist it's time for Republicans to move on. He says it's time to play to win, and that needs to include embracing mail-in voting.\n\n\"I still have people that are adamant against them (mail in ballots), they say, 'Well, it's it's it's an avenue for fraud.' And I said, 'Yeah, it could be,'\" Eddy said. \"But we've got to play that game. Otherwise we lose. We can't win an election without them.\"\n\nEddy and Talarico both see advantages when it comes to mail-in voting: It allows voters more flexibility and makes it easier to vote, thus boosting turnout.\n\nIt also allows party officials to focus their \"get out the vote\" efforts. Applications for a mail-in ballot are public information, and so is whether or not those ballots have been submitted. That means campaigns can reach out to voters directly and remind them to turn in their votes.\n\nVoters can also check a box and have a mail-in ballot automatically sent to them for all future elections, making it even more likely they'll vote in the future. That's a huge help to political parties, and right now an area where Democrats enjoy a huge edge. As a Republican, Eddy describes that option this way: \"If you can get people to check that [box], that's the best thing in the world.\"\n\nLies about voter fraud stoke Republican skepticism\n\nBut as Eddy tries to spread the gospel of mail-in voting to Republicans, he knows he's facing an uphill battle. He tells the story of what he encountered when he tried to hand out mail-in ballot applications at a Trump rally in Erie last summer.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"I started at 6:30 in the morning, and I went to everybody that was lined up, all 10,000 people, and I asked them, 'Here's a mail in ballot,' and I gave them my reasons why. And the majority of those people said, 'No,' because, one, Donald doesn't endorse it and two, it's fraud,\" Eddy remembered.\n\nHe says that he only managed to get about 300 people in that crowd of thousands to sign up. Trump's lies about widespread fraud in the 2020 election that he lost have been convincing.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Don Gonyea/NPR Don Gonyea/NPR\n\nThat why it's easy to find that distrust in mail-in voting when you talk to Republican voters.\n\n\"I think you should go to the polls with your license and prove who you are and vote. That's it,\" Tim Stevenson, the auto repair shop owner, said.\n\nStevenson plans to vote in person.\n\nState Sen. Dan Laughlin of Erie thinks that mindset leaves a lot to chance \u2014 bad weather or a flat tire on Election Day could keep you at home.\n\nLaughlin was a rare Republican supporter of mail-in voting back in 2020, and he says former President Trump does Republicans a disservice by continuing to bad-mouth mail-in ballots.\n\n\"If by chance, you use this clip in your interview and it gets back to him and he hears it, I hope he's listening,\" Laughlin said. \"Because he's the only one that can fix it. Because the rest of us are trying, right?\"\n\nIf Republicans don't get competitive on mail-in ballots, Laughlin said, \"We're going to get our clock cleaned.\"",

How much affect will abortion have on the 2024 presidential race, according to Marcus? How about David Brooks? Where did Kamala Harris make her recent remarks about reproductive rights? When is the 2024 presidential election? Why do Marcus and Brooks have such different takes on whether or not abortion will be a key issue in the 2024 race?\n\nFOCUS QUESTIONS\n\nAt the start of the interview, Geoff Bennett asked: \"...what do you make of this aggressive strategy by the Biden campaign to keep the abortion issue in the spotlight and pin Donald Trump as the architect of abortion restrictions in bans like the one in Arizona?\"\n\nDo you see this as an effective political strategy for the Biden campaign? Why or why not?\n\nMedia literacy: Ruth Marcus said, \"Abortion is the gift, and this is an odd way to say it, but it keeps on giving politically for Democrats. It's an odd way to say it, because, obviously, removing abortion rights from American women has affected many women's lives and caused a lot of damage. But, politically, for Democrats, it has been, I think, beyond their wildest dreams.\"\n\nNewsHour's Bennett moves on to ask David Brooks a question. What would you have asked Marcus as a follow up question to her statement?

        "text": "Fact check: Trump\u2019s false and unsubstantiated claims about his Manhattan criminal case\nWashington CNN \u2014\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has repeatedly made false and unsubstantiated claims while denouncing the Manhattan criminal case against him over his alleged falsification of business records related to a hush money scheme executed during the 2016 presidential election.\n\nWith Trump\u2019s trial scheduled to start Monday, here is a fact check of some of Trump\u2019s remarks.\n\nTrump\u2019s baseless claims that Biden is secretly running the case\n\nTrump has repeatedly claimed that the Manhattan case has been secretly orchestrated by President Joe Biden, Biden\u2019s White House or the Biden-era federal Justice Department. As supposed evidence, Trump has cited the fact that Matthew Colangelo, who had served as a senior Justice Department official under Biden, left the department in 2022 for a job in the office of the Manhattan district attorney who is prosecuting the case, Alvin Bragg.\n\nFor example, Trump said in February: \u201cWhat it is, is election interference. It\u2019s being run by Joe Biden\u2019s White House. His top person was placed here in order to make sure everything goes right.\u201d He continued, \u201cHis top person, Colangelo, and some others have been placed into the DA\u2019s office to make sure they do a good job of election interference.\u201d Trump claimed in a social media post in March that unspecified Biden \u201cThugs\u201d sent Colangelo to the district attorney\u2019s office to \u201coversee\u201d Bragg, \u201cperhaps to make sure that Bragg followed their illegal orders and commands.\u201d In a social media post on Wednesday, Trump wrote, \u201cBIDEN\u2019S DOJ IS RUNNING THE CASE.\u201d\n\nFacts First: There is no basis for Trump\u2019s claims. First, there is no evidence that Biden, his White House or his Justice Department has had any role in launching or running Bragg\u2019s case, let alone that Biden operatives are issuing secret commands in the case - and Bragg is a locally elected official who does not report to the federal government. Second, there is no evidence the White House or the Biden administration had anything to do with Colangelo\u2019s decision to leave the Justice Department and join the district attorney\u2019s office as senior counsel to Bragg; Colangelo and Bragg had been colleagues before Bragg was elected Manhattan district attorney in 2021. Third, there is no basis for the claim that Colangelo oversees Bragg; Bragg is Colangelo\u2019s boss.\n\nBefore Colangelo worked at the Justice Department, he and Bragg worked at the same time in the office of New York\u2019s state attorney general, where Colangelo investigated Trump\u2019s charity and Trump\u2019s financial practices and was involved in bringing various lawsuits against the Trump administration.\n\nOn a minor point, Colangelo was never Biden\u2019s very top official at the Justice Department. Colangelo served as acting associate attorney general in the first months of the Biden administration in early 2021 and then as principal deputy associate attorney general. As acting associate attorney general, he was third in command of the department.\n\nTrump\u2019s false claims that Manhattan has hit all-time highs for murder and violent crime\n\nTrump has repeatedly claimed that Bragg is spending time prosecuting him despite a record-high number of murders and violent crime in Manhattan, one of New York City\u2019s five boroughs.\n\nFacts First: Trump\u2019s claims are not even close to true; Manhattan, like New York City as a whole, is nowhere near record highs for murder or violent crime more broadly. In 1990, when New York City set its all-time murder record, Manhattan recorded 503 murders; it recorded 73 murders in 2023, a decline of about 85%. Manhattan\u2019s numbers for other kinds of violent crime are also far lower today than they were in the early 1990s.\n\nFor example, Manhattan recorded 252 rapes in 2023, down about 63% from the 689 in 1990; 3,841 robberies in 2023, down about 86% from the 26,907 in 1990; and 5,116 felony assaults in 2023, down about 49% from the 10,089 in 1990.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that murder in Manhattan has declined since 2020, Trump\u2019s last full calendar year in office, when there were 84 murders in the borough; it has declined, too, from 2022 (78 murders) and 2021 (92 murders). However, some other kinds of violent crime, such as robbery and felony assault, have increased in Manhattan since 2020, though they declined from 2022 to 2023.\n\nCrime levels are always affected by a complicated mix of factors, and it is unclear how much impact Bragg has had on either the upticks or the declines. The fluctuations in Manhattan have been broadly aligned with trends in New York City as a whole.\n\n\u201cWe have a tendency to want to blame one person, or credit one person, when in reality these are complex systems that rise and fall for often complex, random reasons that we don\u2019t have the ability to explain \u2013 but it\u2019s easier to say, \u2018It was Joe Schmoe over there,\u2019\u201d Jeff Asher, a crime data expert and co-founder of the firm AH Datalytics, told CNN when Trump was making similar claims about Manhattan last year.\n\nTrump\u2019s dubious claim that the judge\u2019s daughter posted an image of him behind bars\n\nTrump has accused the judge presiding over the Manhattan trial, Judge Juan Merchan, of having a conflict of interest because his daughter Loren Merchan has been a Democratic political consultant at a firm that has worked for prominent federal clients, including Biden\u2019s 2020 campaign. But Trump also claimed in a social media post in March that Loren Merchan \u201chas just posted a picture of me behind bars, her obvious goal,\u201d and he wondered in another March post how it is fair for him to be subjected to a Merchan gag order while, among other things, \u201cthe Judge\u2019s daughter is allowed to post pictures of her \u2018dream\u2019 of putting me in jail.\u201d\n\nFacts First: There is no evidence that Loren Merchan was the person who posted a picture of Trump behind bars on social media. A spokesperson for the court, Al Baker, said Loren Merchan didn\u2019t make the post.\n\nBaker said in a March statement that someone else had started using Loren Merchan\u2019s former handle on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, after she deleted her own account and thus abandoned the handle about a year prior. A review of the evidence by The Spectator, a conservative-leaning British outlet, supports Baker\u2019s denial.\n\nBaker said: \u201cThe X, formerly Twitter, account being attributed to Judge Merchan\u2019s daughter no longer belongs to her since she deleted it approximately a year ago. It is not linked to her email address, nor has she posted under that screenname since she deleted the account. Rather, it represents the reconstitution, last April, and manipulation of an account she long ago abandoned.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s exaggerations about Merchan\u2019s gag order\n\nTrump, denouncing Judge Merchan\u2019s gag order on him, claimed in social media posts in early April that Merchan \u201cis not allowing me to talk.\u201d At a campaign rally Saturday in Pennsylvania, Trump said, \u201cOn Monday, in New York City, I will be forced to sit, fully gagged. I\u2019m not allowed to talk. Can you believe it? They want to take away my constitutional right to talk.\u201d\n\nFacts First: Trump\u2019s claims are exaggerations. Merchan did issue a gag order, but it is far narrower than Trump suggested. Merchan has not generally forbidden Trump from talking; Trump is still permitted to defend his conduct at issue in the case (both in public and in any testimony he chooses to offer), to attack Merchan and Bragg, and to campaign for the presidency with rallies, interviews, social media posts and other commentary.\n\nThe gag order forbids Trump from three specific categories of speech: 1) speaking publicly or directing others to speak publicly about \u201cknown or reasonably foreseeable witnesses\u201d in the case - specifically concerning their potential participation in the case; 2) speaking publicly or directing others to speak publicly about prosecutors in the case other than Bragg, about staff members in Bragg\u2019s office and the court, and about the family members of prosecutors, staffers or the court \u2013 \u201cif those statements are made with the intent to materially interfere with, or to cause others to materially interfere with, counsel\u2019s or staff\u2019s work in this criminal case, or with the knowledge that such interference is likely to result\u201d; 3) speaking publicly about or directing others to speak publicly about jurors or prospective jurors in the case.\n\nIn early April, after Trump criticized Merchan\u2019s daughter, Merchan expanded his previous gag order to cover family members of the court and district attorney.\n\nHe wrote: \u201cThe average observer, must now, after hearing Defendant\u2019s recent attacks, draw the conclusion that if they become involved in these proceedings, even tangentially, they should worry not only for themselves, but for their loved ones as well. Such concerns will undoubtedly interfere with the fair administration of justice and constitutes a direct attack on the Rule of Law itself.\u201d\n\nTrump has appealed the gag order, so it\u2019s possible the order will be overturned or narrowed by an appeals court. Submissions on the matter are due on April 29.\n\nTrump\u2019s unexplained claims about Bragg and Soros\n\nWhile attacking Bragg, Trump has repeatedly invoked liberal billionaire and Democratic donor George Soros without explaining the nature of their connection. For example, he called Bragg \u201cthis Soros Prosecutor\u201d in a social media post on Wednesday; in a statement last year, he claimed that Bragg was \u201chand-picked and funded by George Soros.\u201d\n\nFacts First: Trump\u2019s claims about Soros and Bragg need context. Soros did not make any donations to Bragg\u2019s election campaign, and a Soros spokesperson, Michael Vachon, told CNN in 2023 that the two men have never once communicated in any way; there is no evidence that Soros had any role in Bragg\u2019s decision to prosecute Trump. However, Soros, a longtime supporter of Democratic district attorney candidates who favor criminal justice reform, did support Bragg\u2019s election campaign indirectly: he was a major donor to a liberal political action committee, Color of Change PAC, that says it spent just over $500,000 on an independent expenditure effort in support of Bragg\u2019s candidacy.\n\nVachon told CNN in 2023: \u201cBetween 2016 and 2022, George Soros personally and Democracy PAC (a PAC to which Mr. Soros has contributed funds) have together contributed roughly $4 million to Color of Change\u2019s PAC, including $1 million in May 2021. None of those funds were earmarked for Alvin Bragg\u2019s campaign. George Soros and Alvin Bragg have never meet in person or spoken by telephone, email, Zoom etc. There has been no contact between the two.\u201d\n\nSoros has been a frequent target of antisemitic conspiracy theories painting the Jewish philanthropist as a puppetmaster behind various US and international events. In 2023, Color of Change president Rashad Robinson called Trump and his allies\u2019 latest invocations of Soros both \u201cantisemitic\u201d and \u201canti-Black\u201d; he told CNN that the attacks overstate both Soros\u2019 role in the PAC\u2019s decision-making and the PAC\u2019s role in Bragg\u2019s election victory.\n\nYou can read a longer fact check on this subject here.\n\nTrump\u2019s false claims that he has been indicted more than Al Capone\n\nAs Trump has denounced his four indictments \u2013 the one in Manhattan, another local indictment in Fulton County, Georgia, and two federal indictments \u2013 he has repeatedly claimed that he has been indicted \u201cmore than Al Capone,\u201d the notoriously vicious 1920s and 1930s gangster.\n\nFacts First: Trump\u2019s claim is false. Trump has been indicted four times, while Capone was indicted at least six times, as A. Brad Schwartz, the co-author of a book on Capone, told CNN in 2023. (You can find details about Capone\u2019s indictments here.) And that doesn\u2019t include various criminal charges against Capone that did not involve an indictment, such as some misdemeanors, or obscure Capone cases for which CNN couldn\u2019t immediately determine whether there was an indictment.\n\nSchwartz also noted: \u201cThis isn\u2019t a race, of course, but it may be worth noting that Capone is also way ahead in individual counts (the 1931 Prohibition indictment alone added up to five thousand conspiracy charges).\u201d Trump faces a total of 88 counts over the four indictments.",

It almost happened in 2020. And ever since former president Donald Trump has repeated the lie again and again that he won that election.\n\nDONALD TRUMP: That was a rigged election. And it's a shame that we had to go through it.\n\nIt's very bad for our country. All over the world. They looked at it.\n\nBROOKS: Trump and his team tried several strategies to overturn the election, including that infamous call in January of 2021 to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger.\n\nTRUMP: So look, all I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have, because we won the state.\n\nBROOKS: Trump did not win the state of Georgia. Raffensperger, a Republican who had supported Trump, resisted Trump's pressure. But four days later on January 6, 2021, rioters attacked the U.S. Capitol as lawmakers were voting to certify Joe Biden's victory. Many of the attackers were motivated by the false claims that the election had been stolen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven the guardrails of democracy held, but now, as Trump runs for president again, election law expert Lawrence Lessig is worried that American democracy faces an even greater risk. He says Trump could try to steal the election again, and this time he could do it legally. Unless Congress or the courts take action.\n\nLessig is the Roy L. Furman professor of law and leadership at Harvard Law School. He is co-author, along with Matthew Seligman, of the book, \"How to Steal a Presidential Election.\" And he's with us now. Professor Lessig, good to have you. Welcome to On Point.\n\nLAWRENCE LESSIG: Thanks for having me, Anthony.\n\nBROOKS: Yeah, it's really great to have you.\n\nA lot to think about. And before we talk about how the election could be stolen this time around, let's go back to the riot at the Capitol. On January 6th, you say that as tragic as that day was, the guardrails of democracy held, and you say that, in fact, it was the dumbest thing Trump and his supporters could have done, and the other strategies that they were employing explain that.\n\nLESSIG: In the lead up to that election Matt Seligman and I taught a course at Harvard called Wargaming 2020. And we had the students work through the strategies that would have been available to flip an otherwise determined, decided election. And of all the strategies, of course, we never imagined the idea of marching on the Capitol.\n\nThe marching on the Capitol strategy was the one certain to fail. Now, I'm honestly not convinced in Donald Trump's mind there was the idea of coercing through force Congress to flip its results. I think that what he intended to do was to get Congress to send the results back to the states, or at least send them.\n\nAnd had he done that, there would have been no precedent. There would have been no power to do that. But had he done that, the pressure could have built so that eventually Congress caved. But the idea that you were going to march people with violence to threaten the vice president, or members of Congress to flip their vote, was just crazy.\n\nBROOKS: Just crazy. So this leads us to what you call as a result of workshopping these various scenarios, what you call one of the most alarming scenarios made possible by the Supreme Court itself. And this relates to a 2020 decision in a case that you were involved in. So explain what we're talking about here.\n\nLESSIG: Right. So in 2016 there were a number of presidential electors across the country who were troubled by the fact that Donald Trump had lost the popular vote but was going to win in the Electoral College. And these electors started trying to recruit Republican electors to join them to vote for somebody other than Donald Trump, so that the decision would go to the House and the House could decide whether the guy who lost the election should be president or somebody else. And when they did this in Colorado and in Washington, they were punished for voting contrary to how they were pledged.\n\nSo I volunteered to help them resolve the question, whether they could constitutionally be punished. Because the Constitution creates what's called electors, seemed pretty intuitive that an elector is somebody who is free to decide how they're going to vote. These people were trying to decide to vote in a way that would at least create the opportunity for a decision other than the election of Donald Trump, which of course, when people voted for Hillary Clinton in their states, that's what they certainly wanted.\n\nAnd so the question was whether the state could punish them. We took it to the Supreme Court and my primary hope was just to resolve it one way or the other when it wasn't going to matter in a real election. And the Supreme Court basically decided 9 to 0 that the states have the power to control how electors vote a vote.\n\nAnd as the Supreme Court said, the electors, quote, have no rights. So that creates what we're most anxious, the scenario we're most anxious about. Imagine the state of Wisconsin is extremely close in this next election.\n\nBROOKS: Wait, can I just stop you. Because I want to be absolutely, I want to get to Wisconsin, but just to be clear.\n\nSo in your reading, the court held that state legislatures have the power essentially to direct electors how to cast their electoral votes. Electors do not have the power to say, I'm going to vote this way because I think that's where the will of the people is.\n\nLESSIG: Yeah. The court had been led to be very fearful of electors.\n\nMy friend Rick Hasen had written a paper that basically said a handful of electors could flip the result. Actually, in the history of the 24,000 votes that electors had given since the beginning of the Republic, there had been exactly one elector who ever flipped his vote to favor the other side.\n\nAnd the reason he did it in 1796 was because he was trying to vote for the person who actually got more votes in his state. So I think electors were badly maligned in this whole process cause I think that we should have trusted them. But anyway, the court said the state legislatures have the power to tell them how to vote.\n\nOkay. So where does that lead us? So again, imagine Wisconsin is extremely close. It still has an overwhelmingly Republican state legislature because of gerrymandering that's been eliminated by the courts. But in 2024, they will still be in control on Election Day. Imagine it is extremely close and the Republicans start saying even though Joe Biden won the state by a slim majority, they don't believe the results were valid.\n\nThey think that in fact Donald Trump won, there were lots of illegal votes or whatever else they want to say. So they create this kind of impression that in fact the wrong person won. And then they conceivably pass a resolution in the legislature, because there are some who believe, on the Supreme Court too, that the state legislature alone has the power to tell the electors what to do. Because the Constitution gives to the legislature the power to set the way in which electors are chosen.\n\nSo the state legislature tells the Biden electors, vote for Trump. And under a companion case to the one I argued in the Supreme Court, the Colorado electors' case, the court upheld a procedure by which the electors who fail to vote in the way they are supposed to vote can be removed. In the scenario we're talking about, the Biden electors, I'm sure, will say, no, I'm not going to vote for Trump, I'm going to vote for Joe Biden.\n\nThey would be removed under the procedure that we're describing, and they would be replaced with a Trump elector. So here is a way that within the midst of the fog of war, given the rules of the way the court has articulated them, you could produce the opposite result.\n\nNow, look, we don't believe Elena Kagan when she wrote that opinion, intended that.\n\nBROOKS: I was just going to ask you about that. Because she writes that, the decision ends with a promise here. We the people rule. That certainly doesn't sound like an opinion that intended this particular outcome that you're worried about.\n\nLESSIG: Exactly right. But the opinion also says the electors have no rights. So the question is, Who's going to have the power to say no to the state legislature? Ordinarily, that's what we imagine rights are for. I have the right to the Massachusetts legislature can't tell everybody they have to vote Republican or Democrat.\n\nAnd if somebody, if they did, then somebody wanted to vote Republican, I'm assuming the legislature would tell them they have to vote Democrat in Massachusetts. If somebody wanted to vote Republican, that person would say, look, I have a right as an elector to vote however I want. The court said there's no, they have no rights here.\n\nBut my point is, I'm sure that if we could get the case up to the court quickly enough, the court would find a way to say no, that's not quite what we mean. You can't do that. But the challenge is the timing in this period is so narrow. Now in the case recently argued, Trump v. Anderson, which was whether Trump could be kicked off of the Colorado ballot.\n\nJustice Alito asked about this hypothetical, and we were hopeful that would lead to a footnote in that opinion, saying obviously you can't change the vote after the election, but they didn't do that. So we're vulnerable now to this innovation. And if it's made, then there's a race to get to the court to get it corrected.\n\nBROOKS: So I'm curious about this. So let's stick with Wisconsin, Republican majority. But there's a democratic governor. Doesn't the governor get involved with having to sign a law that would basically say, the electors have to vote this way or that way? Or is the governor out of the picture?\n\nThere's a theory, the independent state legislature doctrine, that says that the legislature can't be bound, because the Constitution says it's the legislature that sets the manner by which electors are chosen. I don't agree with that theory. I think the governor should be involved. But my point is not about what the ultimate legal answer would be. Because again, my view is the ultimate legal answer is the Supreme Court would say, you can't change the result after the election.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt's just in the timing of this fight. Will there be enough time for the court to get involved and resolve it before the electors vote? Because another whole chapter of the problem that the next election will face is that Congress, through the Electoral Count Reform Act, has narrowed the time during which we can try to resolve the election.\n\nSo if it's not resolved by the time the electors vote, it's not clear a result could be changed after the electors' vote.\n\nBROOKS: So is there any legal argument that might prevent a legislature from taking the vote away from its people in this way. In other words, if you could get this to the court?\n\nLESSIG: Yeah. So if I argued in the court, or when it's argued in the court, I would say what the court should say is, \"Congress has the power to say when electors are chosen, and you can't choose electors after that.\" What the electors case said is that states have the power to direct how electors vote, but states can't change that after the day that the electors are to be selected either.\n\nNow that's out of whole cloth. There's nothing in the text of anything that would say that, but that's the safest way to say, \"No. You can't make this change.\"\n\nPart II\n\nBROOKS: We've been talking about how a Republican state legislature, in the state, for example, of Wisconsin could tell electors how to vote contrary to the will of voters.\n\nIt sounds Doomsday-ish to some people, but you make an important point about the power of state legislators and the way we currently run elections, and that is because of state laws, most states award presidential electors on a winner-take-all basis. Which effectively subverts the will of millions and millions of voters across the country.\n\nSo can you explain that, and just how this sort of step from that to the scenario that you're outlining, it's not a big reach.\n\nLESSIG: Yeah. The scenario that I think every constitutional lawyer would concede is legal is for the legislature before election day to say, \"Look, we've decided we're not going to have an election.\"\n\nOr if we have an election, that's not how we're going to pick electors. We're just going to vote for who the elector is going to be. And so Wisconsin, in this case, would say, we're going to vote for the Republican slate of electors, whatever the election is. People hear that and they're like, that's outrageous.\n\nHow could that be? But the point to see is that because states, all states except two, Nevada and Nebraska and Maine, allocate their electors in what's called winner-take-all fashion, all but about eight states in the country have decided who their electors will be given to before election day. Like in Massachusetts, we take winner take all.\n\nThere is no way the Republican candidate, any Republican candidate, probably, would win in Massachusetts. Same thing in Utah, which is winner take all. There's no way a Democratic candidate will win in Utah. Which means that no Republican or Democrat will care about Utah or Massachusetts or New York or Kentucky or any state.\n\nWhere this winner-take-all fashion means that the result can't change regardless of what you do. And what that means is that people who decide America are the swing states. So in the next election, it's going to be Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nevada, Arizona are the key swing states, maybe New Hampshire, maybe North Carolina.\n\nThe rest of the country is irrelevant. And what that means is presidential campaigns, in some sense, don't really care about the rest of the country. There's been great academic work demonstrating that policies get bent to favor the swing states. And so the swingers actually decide the presidency.\n\nBut the challenge is the swing states, the swingers of America don't represent America. And that's a decision the state legislatures have made for no constitutionally obligated reason. Like they could decide tomorrow to allocate electors proportionally. I think even at a fractional level. So if you get 45% of the vote, you get exactly 45% of the electors. They could make that choice, but they haven't. And because they haven't, the vast majority of America's electors, votes on Election Day for president just don't matter.\n\nBROOKS: They could make that choice, and your argument is they could also make this choice, essentially instructing electors to vote contrary to the will of the people. It's not a big, a second scenario that you point to is something you call a rogue governor scenario. A governor decides to flip the results of the presidential election. You call this the greatest long term threat to U.S. democracy. Explain how that works.\n\nLESSIG: Yeah, so we the word long term is important. Because fortunately, coming into this election, the only potential, or the only governor who could be rogue, or potentially rogue, is not even elected yet.\n\nThe candidate Robinson in North Carolina is a clear MAGA candidate, and if anybody is going to go rogue, he would go rogue. The rest of the states, the swing states, at least, have Democratic governors or the two Republican governors, Kemp and Sununu, in Georgia and in New Hampshire are reasonable.\n\nThey're not going to go rogue. But the long-term concern is that under the Electoral Count Act, the governor's signature is really critical for determining how the electoral votes are counted. And if you have a governor who believes, again, that the election was stolen or believes that the right candidate did not win according to the electoral board, and they certify the wrong candidate.\n\nIt will take Congress going through a lot of hoops to be able to reverse that result. Now, if Congress is unified, both houses are controlled by the same party, they will do what that party wants them to do. But the challenge is if they're split, if one is Democratic and one is Republican, then the law will set the governor's signature as the presumptive winner, and that could mean the wrong person actually wins.\n\nBROOKS: So let's hear a voice that pushes back a little bit on some of what you say. Here's Bertrall Ross. He's the Justice Thurgood Marshall Distinguished Professor of Law at the University of Virginia. He also directs the Karsh Center for Law and Democracy there. Ross says it's not impossible that the 2024 election could be stolen, but he says it's unlikely.\n\nAnd part of the reason why is that the Electoral Count Reform Act that Congress passed in 2022 puts a lot of protections in place.\n\nROSS: It set forth standards that limit who can send their slate of electors from the state so that only the executive of the state has that responsibility with respect to sending state electors, so that there's not that multiple elector problem.\n\nThe higher burdens on members of Congress to object to electors that are sent to Congress is also provided for expedited judicial procedures for disputes over elections.\n\nBROOKS: So that's Bertrall Ross, the University of Virginia. Larry Lessig, respond to that. Did the reform that Congress passed, essentially the Electoral Count Reform Act, does that help this situation, make you sleep a little, help you sleep a little better at night?\n\nLESSIG: There are parts of it that are great and parts of it that create more problems. So here's a simple example of a problem it creates. In 1960, in Hawaii, Nixon was declared the winner originally, and he was certified as the winner. And then the Democrats noticed an error in the tabulation of the vote, so they asked for a recount.\n\nThe recount couldn't be completed until after the electors voted. But the Nixon and Kennedy electors both gathered on Elector Day and cast their votes. The Kennedy electors were the first so called fake electors in our tradition. And when the recount was completed at the end of December, the recount went for Kennedy.\n\nAnd so the governor certified for Kennedy, and they sent the certification in and the certification for Kennedy was eventually counted. If that same scenario happened under the Electoral Count Act of 2022, it would be Nixon's votes that would be counted. Because first of all, it's not clear any electors going to sit and vote.\n\nAny Kennedy elector in the story would sit and vote because of the prosecution against the so-called fake electors. But even if they did, under the electoral count reform act, the only way to object is if you can say that the electors were not properly certified, but at the time they were certified, they were properly certified.\n\nIt was the result the governor was acting under. And so what the Electoral Count Reform Act has done is basically mean that if you can slow a recount down so that it's not resolved before the elector's vote. It could never go against you. Now, this is a problem that doesn't benefit Republicans alone.\n\nIt could be Republicans or Democrats who benefit from this. And this obvious incentive then, if you've won, and then there's a recount going on, your incentive is to do everything you can to slow that process down, which is not hard in the context of electoral, the way these procedures work. If you slow it down until after the elector's vote, then you can't lose.\n\nBut of course, that means the American democracy could lose if, in fact, the result was not correct, and the recount goes for the other candidates. So that's a problem created by the Electoral Count Reform Act. It could have solved this, in a completely different way. It could have fixed this problem.\n\nAnd we actually have a solution. I think that Congress should have a sufficient reason, because it's not partisan, to fix it before 2024. And the simplest way to fix it would be to say that there's a category called contingent electors. So if you think that there's a judicial proceeding that could finally resolve the state in your favor, then you as the electors can meet on electors' day and sign the electors' certificates. But mark them contingent and then let the recount procedure continue.\n\nAnd if the courts eventually rule in favor of you, then your votes would be counted. That would be a simple change to the Electoral Count Reform Act. And if it were changed, then this problem would go away.\n\nBROOKS: Larry, I want to introduce another voice in this conversation. Jessica Marsden is Director of Impact Programs for Free and Fair Elections at Protect Democracy.\n\nThat's a nonpartisan anti-authoritarianism group. And Jessica Marsden, welcome. Good to have you.\n\nJESSICA MARSDEN: Happy to be here, Anthony.\n\nBROOKS: Yeah, it's really good to have you. What do you make of the sort of alarm that Lawrence Lessig is putting out here about the possibility of stealing an election legally in 2024?\n\nMARSDEN: I want to start by saying, I think legally stealing an election is a contradiction in terms, so it's really important to understand the procedural vulnerabilities that Professor Lessig has been describing, but also to underline that these tactics at bottom are no different than stuffing a ballot box, and they're the kind of tactics that we've seen in authoritarian regimes that have slid from democracy into authoritarianism.\n\nWe've seen it Russia, for example, where Putin has blown through term limits, jailed opponents, allowed only stooge opponents to run. And so I think we have to be clear that although these strategies would take advantage of legal loopholes, they're not legal in any meaningful sense of the word.\n\nBROOKS: But go ahead. So what do you see out there? What's currently happening in states that either encourages you or discourages you?\n\nMARSDEN: So big picture, I think we're in a much better place in many ways than we were in 2020. We heard a moment ago about the important reforms in the Electoral Count Reform Act.\n\nWe also saw that in 2022 election deniers running for statewide office in swing states lost across the board. So that means we have reasonable, good faith pro-democracy actors in virtually all critical statewide positions in key states. And that election also showed that democracy was an important issue for some voters.\n\nA couple other things to mention, the Supreme Court mostly rejected the independent state legislature theory, which would have given hyper partisan state legislators much more power to manipulate elections. And then finally, Former President Trump is not in power and does not control the levers of the federal government.\n\nTo the extent that he is the leader of an effort to steal an election, he doesn't have the same amount of power that he did in 2020.\n\nBROOKS: Sure.\n\nMARSDEN: Now that said --\n\nBROOKS: Yeah, no, go ahead. I just want to throw those ideas over to Larry. And that was something on top of my list, Larry, this idea that Trump is no longer president.\n\nHe doesn't have control of the levers of power. The Justice Department, he reportedly even considered ordering the U.S. military to seize voting machines to look for fraud. He's not going to be able to do that. So what do you think of the basic idea that Jessica laid out there that while there may be some risks to be worried about, we're better off than we were four years ago.\n\nLESSIG: She's certainly true that we're better off in the sense that we're more prepared and we've seen some questions resolved in a way that reduces the risk. And it's certainly true, the President Trump is not president. So he has limited access to the tools that he might otherwise want to deploy.\n\nIt's also true that he's wildly more motivated now than he was in 2020.\n\nBROOKS: Explain.\n\nLESSIG: Because if he loses, there's a huge chance he goes to jail. There's certainly a huge chance he loses his whole, all of his wealth. So the risk that he faces in losing is huge. And I think that's going to motivate him to do everything he can to win.\n\nBut I think, I want to make clear one very basic point about why we wrote this book. This is not a book betting that the election is going to be stolen. It's not a book offering the probability that the election is going to be stolen. It's a book trying to help people to see the risks so that we all, especially groups like Protect Democracy, that has been one of the most important groups in building the resistance to make sure we have free and fair elections.\n\nWe all begin to see the strategies we need to be prepared to respond to. So in the critical sense that there is this risk. There are these holes, these loopholes that I think that we need to identify and be prepared to respond to and recognize that we can't shift into automatic pilot just because it seems like we've learned something from 2020. And we won't make the same mistakes again.\n\nThe reality is the number of people today who believe the election was stolen is the same as a number who believed it was stolen on January 6th, 2021, and that reality creates a condition if things are close enough, that these techniques could be exploited. And that's exactly what we're working on.\n\nBROOKS: Jessica Marsden. What do you think of that? It is striking what Larry was saying. This idea of the depth of belief in the idea, in the mistaken idea that the election was stolen hasn't budged since 3 plus years ago.\n\nMARSDEN: That's absolutely true. And that's one of the things that we're most worried about when we look out across the states.\n\nAnd think about how this election might go off the rails. The spread of mis- and disinformation has really not let up since 2020. And that has had real concrete effects on election officials in particular who have faced a wave of threats and other interference with their ability to do their jobs.\n\nThat's like nothing we've seen in previous election cycles, and it's also impacted voters, some of whom have been subject to intimidation campaigns like we saw in Arizona in 2022, where you had folks with video cameras and even guns stationed outside drop boxes looking for voter fraud.\n\nSo there's absolutely real consequences to this voter fraud that professor Lessig was describing.\n\nBROOKS: So let's hear some tape about how central the big lie has become in this political climate. Stephen Richer is a local election official in Maricopa County, Arizona. He's also a Republican. Richard sued U.S. Senate candidate Kari Lake for defamation because she falsely accused him of cheating her out of winning the governor's race in 2022.\n\nSo here's Richard on MSNBC last month, talking about the big lie.\n\nSTEPHEN RICHER: Unfortunately, it has become something of a litmus test in some quarters. Many of those candidates who won their primary based off of the big lie, that didn't carry over to the median Arizona voter. It's a losing strategy. It's lost in '23.\n\nIt's lost in '22. It's lost in '21. It lost in '20, but more than that, it's immoral and people know better and leaders need to stop.\n\nBROOKS: Larry Lessig, what do you think about that? It's been a losing argument and yet it's still there creating the soil, for the things that you're worried about.\n\nLESSIG: Yeah. When Trump's family took over RNC and fired everybody at RNC and gave them all a chance to apply for their jobs back, one condition of getting their jobs back was certifying that they agree with the election in 2020 was stolen. I think that this has potential.\n\nIt's gunpowder. And if it's dry enough and you have a spark, the fear that many of us have is that it blows up and that's what we have to be prepared to fight against.\n\nPart III\n\nBROOKS: I want to talk about a couple of potential solutions. Larry, and let's start with what needs to be fixed. Where is the quickest, not the quickest, but the most important sort of set of solutions that you're proposing?\n\nLESSIG: I think one category could be organized under the slogan Elena Kagan gave us in the elector's case, which is her We the people rule. And what that means is we've got to build recognition. That any steps the legislature might take to change the results of an election, whether by cancelling the election, effectively, deciding that the state legislature will pick the electors, or by changing how the electors vote, is just illegitimate.\n\nIt's wrong, and I think Jessica's way of characterizing it is, it's what authoritarians do. It's not what's legal under our constitutional system. The second is, I think there should be no reason why Republicans and Democrats would resist the idea of allowing the process to work itself out and making it so that if, in fact, it has to take beyond the time electors are to vote, there would be a strategy to make sure that the correct result gets counted.\n\nSo this is the Hawaii 2.0 problem. And I think the simplest thing would be to make it so that you could have electors who vote a contingent slate. And then if, in fact, the courts determine their candidate wins, that's the slate that gets counted. And finally, I think there's an enormous amount of work, and Protect Democracy, again, has been the leader here, in just making sure on the ground, in every single contested space, we have process to make sure people are not afraid to vote and not afraid and not blocked from their ability to vote.\n\nSo that when this election is over, we can look at it and feel like it really confirms the very best of our traditions, not the fear that I think Matt and I have about what could happen.\n\nBROOKS: Jessica, add to that in terms of the work you do. Talk about the sort of importance of that last point that Larry was talking about and the progress or the challenges you're seeing on the ground.\n\nMARSDEN: Yeah. So to add a couple of things to that list of potential solutions. I think one thing, a common thread throughout the scenarios described in the book is uncertainty and delay in uncovering or reaching the true outcome of the election. And one thing we have been working on at Protect Democracy after the passage of the Electoral Count Reform Act is working with states to ensure that they are able to meet that new deadline, that their recount procedures where possible can be sped up so that the outcome of the election is clear before the governor has to certify the results and before the electors meet.\n\nAnd we've had successes even in swing states like Arizona and Michigan, where bipartisan coalitions came together to support these changes, which ultimately are about getting clarity about who really won the election and not falling into this period of legal uncertainty or sort of fog of war. I think the other two things that I'd emphasize is there's a lot of work going on right now in states to rebuild trust in elections across the political spectrum.\n\nThat work is critically important, because these strategies of legislative intervention or gubernatorial intervention to certify the wrong winner of the election only work if that looks like a politically palatable strategy. And rebuilding trust in elections is part of making that look unpalatable.\n\nAnd then the final thing I'll mention is we did see some aspects of strategies like this tried in 2020 and the work to ensure that the folks who led those efforts are held accountable through prosecutions of fake electors, disbarment proceedings of some of the lawyers who made bogus arguments that these were truly legal strategies.\n\nThose are important in sending a message to people who might be involved in similar attempts this year that, Is it illegal? And there will be consequences.\n\nBROOKS: So I want to talk, Larry, get you to respond to that. One of those ideas which seems so important here in this idea of rebuilding trust, because what do you do about the fact that the cynicism is a result, among other things, of a number of real things.\n\nToo much money in politics, which I know is one of the things that you've been concerned about for decades. Citizens United, the anti-democratic nature of the electoral college, which we talked about. Partisan gerrymandering. In a sense, you could almost be led to conclude, no wonder people can be made to believe that an election was fixed or stolen.\n\nHow do we deal with that?\n\nLESSIG: I think the root behind the ability to create these alternative realities is the reality that we increasingly live in a media environment where people have their own bubbles and they're tuned into them and they learn the lessons from those bubbles. An astonishing statistic, a poll came out about six weeks ago, found that the majority of Americans believe the Republican Party is more committed to protecting democracy than the Democratic Party.\n\nNow, people in the Democratic Party look at that and say, How is that possibly true? You have a guy that tried to overturn the results of the elections. But the answer is, you have a bunch of people who've heard for the last six years this story about the constant efforts to witch hunt and take down through political means a candidate for president creating this impression.\n\nI don't think it's true, but an impression that you have partisan motivation inside of our election process. I don't know how we get out of that reality of media. The only way we get out of it is if people face to face, one to one, begin to just talk to each other and engage on about this reality of our division and how we need to get beyond it.\n\nThat's a big thing to hope for, given the nature of this kind of fight right now and the many years we've been in the middle of what feels like an existential struggle. But we're not going to change the way media functions. And if anything, social media is going to be less disciplined in the way it involves itself in the selection between X, formerly Twitter and Facebook.\n\nAnd I'm even more concerned about how they might play a negative role.\n\nBROOKS: Larry, before we went on the air, I said to you pretty bluntly, I said thank you for this book, it's given me a ton to think about. It hasn't made me feel really good.\n\nLESSIG: Yeah.\n\nBROOKS: Is there something encouraging in here that you can offer?\n\nIs there a reason to be optimistic or hopeful that something might be changing for the better?\n\nLESSIG: Yes.\n\nBROOKS: Good. Lemme hear it.\n\nLESSIG: And that is that the work to fix our democracy has made enormous progress in the past 10 years. It wasn't long ago when I felt like I was doing everything I could to get this democracy reform package in the center of Congress's attention.\n\nCongress took that up in the For the People Act, which would have been the most important democracy reform package passed by Congress, I think, since the Civil War. It came within two votes of actually doing that. Now, that a decade ago would have been incomprehensible. And I think that many people are recognizing this isn't a partisan problem.\n\nIt's a democracy problem. And we have to find a way to motivate people to demand that we get a democracy we can trust. And there are things we can do. This book is not saying there's nothing we can do. It's saying there's a lot we can do. And we need to step up and do it, not just for the 2024 election, but for every election that happens afterwards.\n\nBROOKS: Jessica, reasons from you to be hopeful about where we are?\n\nMARSDEN: I think I take greatest hope from the results of the election in 2022, when we saw that for many voters, the election denialism coming from folks who were running for statewide office to run elections was not appealing, and those candidates all lost.\n\nI think that shows that democracy is an important issue for some voters when the stakes are presented so clearly to them. And this election is going to put those stakes front and center, not just in terms of the issue that gets labeled democracy, but issues like abortion rights are at the forefront.\n\nAnd I think the ways in which those issues have been, or policy on those issues has been shaped by some undemocratic forces in our structure, is going to be at the top of many voters' minds.\n\nBROOKS: Jessica, you mentioned those election deniers are running for positions that oversaw elections in 2022, that they were all defeated.\n\nAnd I've heard a lot about those races. We were focused on them for quite a time, but do we know roughly the number of election deniers that are still in positions of power in the country that could exert real influence to overturn an election in 2024?\n\nMARSDEN: So because of the decentralized way that our elections are run, it's hard to, we're talking about thousands of officials across the country who have some influence over our elections, so it's hard to get a firm number nationwide. But a report from the States United Democracy Center has identified 25 election deniers who are in statewide office with some amount of election responsibility.\n\nThose officials are overwhelmingly in very red states that are not likely to be highly contested in 2024. And then at the local level, research has focused on kind of the key swing states. And a report from Informing Democracy found 94 local officials across 59 jurisdictions in the seven key swing states, Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania.\n\nAnd Wisconsin. So it's not a huge number, but it's definitely some. There are some officials, especially at the local level. And that's something that at Protect Democracy, we're tracking quite closely, as we think ahead to November and December.\n\nBROOKS: And Larry Lessig, a question for you about, I was thinking as I was reading through your arguments, it's troubling when you think about the legal levers that are there that could be exploited and used to overturn the will of voters.\n\nBut my question is, what about the political reality of making that? There may be a legal way to do it, but would it survive politically? Because at the end of the day, if you're taking people's rights away, it just seems like there would be such an outcry against that.\n\nLESSIG: We have to be sure not to simplify what's going on in the heads of people who are acting in ways that we criticize now. The January 6th protesters, the vast majority of them had an honest, genuine belief that the election had been stolen. Now, not everybody, obviously not the leaders. I don't even think Donald Trump believed that.\n\nBut the point is the story had been told to them in a way that they were convinced. And if you're convinced, what's the appropriate response? I don't know if you saw the series Succession, the penultimate, maybe one before, episode involved Wisconsin. There was a fire at the Milwaukee polling station, so the Democratic votes from Milwaukee weren't counted, and the result went for the Republican.\n\nWhat would Democrats do in a case like that? They would genuinely believe that their election had been stolen, and there were steps that could be taken, especially under the new Electoral Count Reform Act, and maybe they wouldn't. And so the condition that we need to put our minds in is when we've got people who believe in good faith, their side is right, and the other side is evil, what tools do we have, could they deploy? Because they'll do whatever they can, because they think they're saving our democracy, and I can understand that's their actions.\n\nIf that's their belief, we need to fight on making sure that is not their belief, right?\n\nBROOKS: So former President Donald Trump is in court today in Manhattan facing criminal charges in this hush money case that relates to campaign finance violations, alleged campaign finance violations and more. What's the effect, do you think, of that on this issue? In other words, does it begin to erode the folks that are following him, believe in him, their confidence in him? And how might that relate to the concerns that you have?\n\nLESSIG: I think it does both. There's a number of people who will read this as this is just another example of the banana republic nation America has become.\n\nJoe Biden has exercised power to continue the prosecutions. But I actually believe that on balance, many people are going to look at this and say, this man is just too damaged. He's just too damaged by what's happened. And between this and the money that he's needed to raise, and the sources of that money, people will increasingly think this is a compromised candidate.\n\nAnd whether they like his policies or not, it'll be too hard to rally to support him. So I can't think that this is going to help his campaign, even though there are a lot of people who are going to be really motivated because of it.\n\nBROOKS: Jessica, what's your thinking about that question?\n\nMARSDEN: I think that's right.\n\nIt's hard to see how this helps him. And indeed, the polling of voters, including in swing states, has shown that if he's ultimately convicted in this trial, that is one thing that could significantly erode support among some folks who are not part of that diehard base.\n\nBROOKS: Really interesting stuff.\n\nJessica, I'm going to say goodbye to you. Jessica Marsden, Director of the Impact Programs for Free and Fair Elections at Protect Democracy, a nonpartisan anti authoritarianism group. Thank you so much for joining us today. We really appreciate it.\n\nMARSDEN: Thanks so much for having it me.\n\nBROOKS: And Larry, we have you for another minute or so.\n\nI guess I'd love to give you a chance to wrap this up with a concluding idea that I might not have given you a chance to express as we head toward what could be another messy and dangerous election.\n\nLESSIG: Yeah, Anthony, you did give me a chance and I want to emphasize that chance you gave me, which is, this is not a hopeless story. It's a hopeful story, and I actually think that if we can rally to get through this election and make the changes to make it safe, we can continue that work to fix the 25 other critical problems that our democracy faces. So that people can have confidence that the result actually reflects the will of all of America, not just swing state America, and that we have politicians who care mainly about us as opposed to mainly about their funders of their super expensive campaigns.\n\nBROOKS: So you're talking among other things about fixing the impact, for example, of Citizens United, and finally dealing with the coercive of effects of too much money in politics.\n\nLESSIG: Yeah, because this is actually, I think what's at root about the cynicism that many Trump supporters have about the system.\n\nThey look at it and they think this is just a corrupted system. And I would agree that in this sense, it is a corrupted and broken system.",

        "text": "Will Robert F. Kennedy be a spoiler in the presidential race?\nThe 2024 presidential race will almost certainly be very close, especially in the few swing states that could decide the Electoral College vote. Hence, a great deal of attention has been paid to the question of \u201cspoilers\u201d\u2014third party or independent candidates who could pull enough votes from President Joe Biden or former President Donald Trump to keep one of them from winning an important state. Now that No Labels has decided not to run a presidential candidate, there are three third-party campaigns going on\u2014one by Cornell West, an African American former Harvard professor who is running as an independent, and another by Jill Stein, who ran as the candidate of the Green Party in 2012 and 2016. And finally, the one getting the most attention, and according to polls the most support, is an independent run by environmentalist and anti-vaxxer Robert F. Kennedy Jr., nephew of former President John Kennedy.\n\nFor any of these candidates to actually win, they need to first qualify for the ballot in at least enough states to account for 270 electoral votes. That is highly unlikely given the difficulty of getting on ballots in the first place. But for any of these candidates to be a spoiler, they need only get on the ballot in a few swing states. Remember that in Arizona and Georgia in 2020, Biden won by .3% of the vote. When races are that close, third-party candidates can become spoilers.\n\nOf the three most talked about \u201cspoilers,\u201d Jill Stein has the best chance of getting on a large number of state ballots. She is substantially ahead in the delegate count for the Green Party\u2019s virtual convention in July and likely to be the nominee. Because the Green Party has been around since 1984, they have state party organizations, and they have run candidates for office.1 Even though they don\u2019t have very many winning candidates, they have enough of an infrastructure that as of this writing they claim to be on the ballot in 20 states, and they are running active campaigns in others. In the 2000 presidential race between former Vice President Al Gore and Governor George W. Bush, consumer advocate Ralph Nader was the Green Party candidate on the ballot in Florida. Bush\u2019s lead was less than one percent of the vote. If you assume many of Nader\u2019s voters would have voted for Al Gore, his 1.6% of the vote would have been more than enough to put the state into Gore\u2019s column.\n\nThe other \u201cspoiler\u201d candidate, Cornel West, is underfunded and without an institutional infrastructure behind him. So far, he has secured ballot access in only three states: Oregon, South Carolina, and Utah. While many people worry that he could pull votes from Biden in big cities with Black populations in key swing states like Michigan and Pennsylvania, he does not appear, at least yet, to have caught on enough in any swing states to become a spoiler.\n\nUnlike Stein and West, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. appears to be closer to becoming a spoiler. Conventional wisdom has that because of his famous name and his environmental work, he will take votes from Biden. However, his anti-vax campaign and his attraction to conspiracy theories have led some to argue that he is also a threat to Trump. So how is Kennedy doing on ballot access? In some states, qualifying for the ballot as a party is easier (fewer signatures) than qualifying for the ballot as a candidate only.2 Therefore, Kennedy\u2019s strategy has been to create a political party called \u201cWe the People\u201d for which he will be the nominee and use it for ballot access in five states\u2014California, Delaware, Hawaii, Mississippi, and North Carolina. Although he is doing better in the polls than all the other third-party candidates, he seems unlikely to be a spoiler in the three heavily Democratic states of California, Delaware, and Hawaii. Nor does he seem likely to be a spoiler in the heavily Republican state of Mississippi. But North Carolina is a state that Democrats have won in the past and is likely to be very close. There, a Kennedy candidacy could keep Biden from a win. The most recent Quinnipiac poll showed Trump leading by two points in the two-way race in North Carolina and by three points in the five-way, with RFK Jr. getting double-digit support.\n\nTable 1 shows the differences between filing as an independent and filing as part of an organized party establishment in some states.",

        "text": "Discussing the power of language in the 2024 presidential election\nThe 2024 presidential election is months away, and both candidates \u2014 President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump \u2014 are on the campaign trail.\n\nThe Florida Roundup spoke with Brittany Shaughnessy, a doctoral student at the University of Florida, and Shawn Welcome, poet laureate for the city of Orlando, about the power of language during this election year.\n\n\u201cIn terms of the public discourse, everything that we think about, I think can be framed in a political context,\u201d Welcome said. \u201cSo, when it comes to poetry, poetry by and large is an expression of the human experience, which can't be necessarily absent from political context. So I don't know if it's never not political at times, because people have their own perceptions of how they're receiving those words and those images.\u201d\n\nWithin politics, language is used by candidates to set an election\u2019s issue agenda through media, according to Shaughnessy.\n\n\u201c\u2026 a lot of communication research since the \u201870s has showed us that the media are really what set the public agenda. And in the modern era, a lot of candidates are using social media. We saw Donald Trump in the lead-up to the 2016 election and, of course, in the lead-up to the 2020 election use social media to really guide the conversation here,\u201d she said.\n\nFor users, Welcome described the impact of social media on language.\n\n\u201cI think social media allows people to have a greater sense of autonomy in terms of what they choose to say. They feel empowered just because of the easy access and ability to have their own audience,\u201d Welcome said. \u201cAnd so I think that just the empowering nature of social media informs maybe some stronger language, language that evokes all of the emotional buttons.\u201d\n\nResearch Shaughnessy led that studies the language Biden and Trump used in 2020 found \u201ccandidates\u2019 issue and moral agendas were correlated with each other and with the media's agenda.\u201d\n\nWith a looming 2024 rematch, Shaughnessy said voters should listen to how both candidates use moral language.\n\n\u201cThe Republican Party frames that a lot differently than the Democratic Party does. But at the end of the day, both parties are really relying on language that your morals are at stake. And that as a country, our way of living and our way of governing is at stake,\u201d Shaughnessy said, calling this use of language an electoral strategy.\n\nShe also noted morals are guiding how some Americans will vote, or whether they will vote at all.\n\n\u201cI think morals have been used for a very long time in electoral politics. And I think that today, you see it get amplified, because people and politicians are using particular buzzwords that they know get their voters to the polls, and we see this on the right and the left,\u201d Shaughnessy said.\n\nThese morals and values tie into a poem Welcome wrote about Orlando, called \u201cReasons Why.\u201d It begins:\n\n\u201cWhen we say or you see, \u2018My City Beautiful\u2026\u2019\n\nHave you ever asked why?\n\nBecause visitors might say palm trees have voices of their own\u2026\n\nSpeak for themselves amidst a cotton candy day sky\u2026 And a rainbow lit night sky. Is it also true for you who reside?\u201d\n\nWelcome relayed the message of the poem through a statewide perspective.\n\n\u201c\u2026 I think it's just a reminder to ask those deep questions, because that's what's going to inform how you move in the voting booth, or just out and about with your community members,\u201d Welcome said.\n\n",

        "text": "US news organizations urge Biden and Trump to agree to TV election debates\nTwelve US news organizations are urging Joe Biden and Donald Trump to agree to TV debates ahead of the November presidential vote, a typical feature of an election year and one that can sometimes play a crucial role.\n\n\u201cIf there is one thing Americans can agree on during this polarized time, it is that the stakes of this election are exceptionally high,\u201d the organizations including ABC, CBS, CNN, Fox News, PBS, NBC, NPR and the Associated Press said in a statement.\n\n\u201cAmidst that backdrop, there is simply no substitute for the candidates debating with each other, and before the American people, their visions for the future of our nation,\u201d they added.\n\nBut the two major candidates have so far resisted debating rival candidates from their own parties, with Trump refusing to participate against the former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley and others, and Biden resisting calls to set foot on a TV stage with rival Democratic candidates, who have since abandoned their electoral efforts to challenge him in the party.\n\nThe news organizations said it was not too early for each campaign to say publicly that it will participate in the three presidential and one vice-presidential TV showdowns set by the non-partisan Commission on Presidential Debates.\n\nIn 2020, Biden and Trump debated twice, with a third debate canceled after then-president Trump tested positive for Covid-19.\n\nLast week, the Trump campaign called for presidential debates to be held earlier and more frequently so voters \u201chave a full chance\u201d to see the candidates in action. Trump campaign managers have argued that by the time of the first scheduled debate, on 16 September, more than 1 million Americans will probably have already voted, with more than 8.7 million voting by the third debate, penciled in for 9 October.\n\nTrump has said he is willing to go head-to-head with Biden \u201canytime, anyplace and anywhere\u201d, starting \u201cnow\u201d. But Biden has been uncommitted to any debate so far, saying last month: \u201cit depends on [Trump\u2019s] behavior.\u201d",

        "text": "In Trump\u2019s New York \u2018hush money\u2019 case, prosecutors push election angle\nExperts say that prosecutors will attempt to make the case that Trump falsified business records to tip the 2016 race.\n\nWhat is Donald Trump\u2019s \u2018hush money\u2019 trial all about?\n\nIt is a blockbuster legal case, set to dominate headlines for weeks to come.\n\nOn Monday, Donald Trump has become the first United States president, past or present, to stand trial in a criminal case. Jury selection is under way this week.\n\nThe trial unfolding in New York centres on sensational allegations: that Trump made hush-money payments to an adult film star, Stormy Daniels, with whom he allegedly had an affair. He has been charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.\n\nBut despite the tabloid-worthy details, legal experts say something more fundamental is at the heart of the trial: how American elections unfold \u2014 and how candidates should be held to account.\n\nThe hush-money payments allegedly happened against the backdrop of the 2016 presidential race, and prosecutors are expected to focus on whether efforts to conceal information could have influenced Trump\u2019s victory in that election.\n\nThe more sordid details have nevertheless dominated public perception of the case, said Shanlon Wu, a former federal prosecutor and political commentator.\n\nAfter all, Trump is accused of trying to buy Daniels\u2019s silence over an affair that allegedly occurred while his wife Melania Trump was pregnant with their child, Barron.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s become shorthand to refer to this as the hush-money case or, worse, as the porn star case,\u201d Wu said.\n\nBut make no mistake, Wu said: The trial will have broad consequences, and its outcome may reflect on the three other criminal indictments Trump faces, particularly those that concern his behaviour during the 2020 election.\n\nProsecutors are set to argue that the hush-money payments were \u201cpart of a deliberate plan to help Trump\u2019s 2016 election\u201d, Wu explained.\n\nA key pillar of that argument will be to establish Trump\u2019s \u201cwillingness to circumvent normal rules and laws about how elections are done, in order to win.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a really important point to make,\u201d Wu added, calling the trial \u201ca preview of his whole attitude towards the elections\u201d.\n\nHistoric indictment\n\nThe path to Monday\u2019s trial began in April last year. That is when Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg unsealed his indictment against Trump.\n\nIn so doing, he made history: Never before had a current or former president faced criminal charges of any kind.\n\nTrump has since been charged in three more criminal cases. In Georgia, he faces an election interference case. And on the federal level, he is facing one indictment for attempting to overturn the 2020 election and a second for allegedly hoarding classified documents.\n\nThe New York indictment, though, relies on a state law designating that falsifying business records is a misdemeanour crime \u2014 but doing so with \u201cintent to defraud and intent to commit another crime\u201d is a felony.\n\nThe indictment did not initially identify the other crime in question, and Trump has not been charged with a secondary crime.\n\nProsecutors, however, released a subsequent \u201cstatement of facts\u201d saying Trump \u201cviolated election laws\u201d.\n\nThe falsifications, they said, were part \u201cof a scheme with others to influence the 2016 presidential election by identifying and purchasing negative information about him to suppress its publication\u201d.\n\nMonths of court filings have further spelled out the possible secondary crimes in question, including violating federal election law governing spending disclosures and a New York state law that criminalises efforts \u201cto promote or prevent the election of any person to a public office by unlawful means\u201d.\n\nSuch laws are meant to protect \u201cvoter informational interest\u201d, said Ciara Torres-Spelliscy, a law professor and fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice\n\n\u201cThe essence of the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s case against ex-President Trump is his alleged illegal use of his corporation to hide his infidelity from American voters on the eve of the 2016 election,\u201d she told Al Jazeera.\n\nTorres-Spelliscy pointed to court precedent establishing voters\u2019 rights to certain information about spending and campaign activities during an election season.\n\nThat transparency is meant to ensure voters have the information they need to choose the candidate they feel best represents their interests.\n\n\u201cThe [US] Supreme Court specifically ruled that disclosure helps citizens make choices in the political marketplace,\u201d Torres-Spelliscy said.\n\n\u201cHiding the hush-money payments \u2014 if they were meant to influence the 2016 election \u2014 would undermine this key interest for American citizens.\u201d\n\nThe judge overseeing Monday\u2019s trial, Juan Merchan, had previously ruled in February that the possible federal and state election violations were \u201clegally sufficient\u201d to move ahead with the felony charges.\n\nThe prosecutors\u2019 strategy\n\nLegal experts expect the prosecution will have a relatively easy chance of establishing that Trump falsified business records by misrepresenting payments he made to his former lawyer and personal fixer Michael Cohen.\n\nThe prosecution has alleged that Trump filed those charges as business expenses, when they were actually used to reimburse Cohen for the payments to Daniels.\n\nBut the falsification on its own would only constitute a misdemeanour crime. In addition, hush-money payments are not necessarily illegal.\n\nThe real battle is, therefore, to establish that the hush-money payments were aimed at tweaking the 2016 presidential race or committing some other related crime.\n\nTo land a conviction on felony charges, District Attorney Bragg will almost certainly have to lean into loftier themes related to US democracy, according to Cheryl Bader, a professor at Fordham University School of Law in the Bronx.\n\n\u201cI think Bragg has to overcome the challenge of this quote-unquote oversized defendant facing what may viscerally really feel like a minor technical reporting violations,\u201d Bader told Al Jazeera.\n\n\u201cHe has to convince jurors that hushing Stormy Daniels is tantamount to election manipulation \u2014 and that Trump knew he needed to fake a paper trail to hide the hush-money payments, so it wouldn\u2019t look like he paid her off.\u201d\n\nIn their indictment, New York prosecutors also detail other instances where Trump\u2019s team sought to stifle potentially damaging information to avoid political fallout.\n\nThey allege Trump entered a \u201ccatch and kill\u201d agreement with the publisher of the National Inquirer, a tabloid, to quash two other stories: one about an alleged affair with Playboy model Karen McDougal and another from a former doorman who claimed Trump fathered a child out of wedlock.\n\nThe agreement, they said, saw the Inquirer buy the rights to the stories, only to bury them on Trump\u2019s behalf while he campaigned for office.\n\nThat is why legal observers believe the timing of the payments is particularly significant. They were made in the waning days of the 2016 election, after the release of an Access Hollywood videotape in which Trump bragged about grabbing women\u2019s genitalia.\n\nBader added that prosecutors will not have to \u201cprove beyond a reasonable doubt that [Trump\u2019s actions] would have actually impacted the election\u201d. But they will have to prove that the falsifications were done with \u201cintent\u201d to commit another crime.\n\n\u201cHow specifically the prosecution will try the case, in terms of these sort of underlying campaign finance violations, is still an open question,\u201d she said.\n\nWider \u2018atmosphere\u2019 likely to affect trial\n\nBut those questions are like to be answered in later weeks, as the trial unspools.\n\nMonday will focus on jury selection, to whittle down a pool of hundreds of prospective jurors to just 12 names and six alternates. That process is expected to last as long as two weeks.\n\nAfterwards, there will be opening statements and witness testimony. Daniels and Cohen are both expected to testify. It is unknown if Trump or his wife, Melania, will take the stand. Closing arguments, jury deliberation and an eventual verdict will follow.\n\nThe proceedings are expected to end before the presidential election in November, possibly the only one of Trump\u2019s four pending trials to do so.\n\nWu, the former prosecutor, explained that it will likely be nearly impossible for Trump\u2019s defence to completely separate the 2016 allegations from events that have happened since.\n\nIn particular, he pointed to Trump\u2019s unfounded claims of fraud during the 2020 presidential election and his role egging on supporters who later stormed the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.\n\nTrump has repeatedly denied wrongdoing, both in the New York case and in subsequent criminal indictments on election interference.\n\nBut Wu believes the setting of the New York trial may be an advantage for the prosecution, given the region\u2019s reputation for leaning left.\n\nWhile other parts of the country might be more sympathetic to Trump\u2019s claims, New Yorkers are more likely to see the 2016 election violation claims as \u201cvery much part of the continuum for Trump and his enablers\u201d.\n\nThe jurors are \u201call going to be pretty much aware of what\u2019s going, and that does not bode well for Trump\u201d, Wu said. \u201cI think atmospherically this is a big help for the prosecution.\u201d",

Samsung \u2013 the only leading-edge semiconductor company that is a leader in both advanced memory and advanced logic technologies \u2013 is expected to invest more than $40 billion dollars in the region in the coming years, and the proposed investment would support the creation of over 20,000 jobs.\n\nThe proposed investment would turn Samsung\u2019s existing presence in Texas into a comprehensive ecosystem for the development and production of leading-edge chips in the United States, including two new leading-edge logic fabs, an R&D fab, and an advanced packaging facility in Taylor, as well as an expansion to their existing Austin facility. It also demonstrates Samsung\u2019s ongoing commitment to the United States, where it has been manufacturing chips since 1996. By continuing to develop the technologies of the future in the United States, Samsung is taking steps that would work towards strengthening U.S. economic and national security and increasing the resilience of both the U.S. and global semiconductor supply chains. Because of investments like Samsung\u2019s, the United States is projected to be on track to produce roughly 20% of the world\u2019s leading-edge logic chips by 2030.\n\n\u201cI signed the CHIPS and Science Act to restore U.S. leadership in semiconductor manufacturing and ensure America\u2019s consumers, businesses, and military maintain access to the chips that underpin our modern technology,\u201d said President Biden. \u201cThis announcement will unleash over $40 billion in investment from Samsung, and cement central Texas\u2019s role as a state-of-the-art semiconductor ecosystem, creating at least 21,500 jobs and leveraging up to $40 million in CHIPS funding to train and develop the local workforce.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks to President Biden\u2019s CHIPS Act, Samsung is expected to invest more than $40 billion to build a cluster of semiconductor factories here in the U.S. that will employ thousands of workers in good-paying jobs, support a robust supplier ecosystem, and fuel innovation through R&D,\u201d said U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo. \u201cProposed CHIPS investments like the ones we are announcing today will be a catalyst for continued private sector investments to help secure the long-term stability we need to put America at the beginning of our semiconductor supply chain and to safeguard a strong resilient ecosystem here at home. The chips that Samsung will be making in Texas are important components to our most advanced technologies, from artificial intelligence to high-performance computing and 5G communications. With President Biden\u2019s leadership and Samsung\u2019s commitment to the U.S., this proposed funding advances America\u2019s leadership in semiconductor manufacturing on the world stage.\u201d\n\nPresident Biden signed the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act to usher in a new era of semiconductor manufacturing in the United States, bringing with it a revitalized domestic supply chain, good-paying jobs, and investments in the industries of the future. The proposed CHIPS investment in Samsung would propel Central Texas into a state-of-the-art leading-edge ecosystem, creating over 17,000 construction jobs and more than 4,500 good-paying manufacturing jobs within the next five years, while stimulating regional commercial growth, leveraging the robust two-year and four-year academic footprint in the state to produce the skilled workers needed to fill the critical roles created by the proposed investment. With these proposed investments and the formation of this ecosystem, CHIPS for America would be helping to deliver on the CHIPS Vision for Success and contributing to the development of the local communities across Central Texas.\n\n\u201cSemiconductor research and development is critical to building a robust and thriving semiconductor manufacturing industry in the United States,\u201d said Under Secretary of Commerce for Standards and Technology and National Institute of Standards and Technology Director Laurie E. Locascio. \u201cSamsung\u2019s plans to build a cutting-edge R&D and advanced packaging facilities in Texas are shining examples of the types of R&D projects that will help build, and heavily contribute to, America\u2019s chip manufacturing industry.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not just expanding production facilities; we\u2019re strengthening the local semiconductor ecosystem and positioning the U.S. as a global semiconductor manufacturing destination,\" said Kye Hyun Kyung, President and CEO of the Device Solutions (DS) Division at Samsung Electronics. \"To meet the expected surge in demand from U.S. customers, for future products like AI chips, our fabs will be equipped for cutting-edge process technologies and help advance the security of the U.S. semiconductor supply chain.\u201d\n\nThe proposed investment would be split across multiple projects at two separate locations in Central Texas:\n\nTaylor, Texas: Construct a comprehensive advanced manufacturing ecosystem, ranging from leading-edge logic to advanced packaging to R&D, transforming the small municipality of Taylor into an expansive hub of leading-edge semiconductor manufacturing. This ecosystem would include two leading-edge logic foundry fabs focused on mass production of 4nm and 2nm process technologies, an R&D fab dedicated to development and research on technology generations ahead of nodes currently in production, and an advanced packaging facility producing 3D High Bandwidth Memory and 2.5D packaging, both of which have critical artificial intelligence applications. The semiconductors that are designed and manufactured in this ecosystem would serve a wide variety of end markets \u2013 from communications, automotive, and defense industries to high-performance computing and artificial intelligence.\n\nAustin, Texas: Expand a facility that has been an economic engine for Central Texas for nearly 30 years. This proposed investment would expand the existing facilities to support the production of leading fully depleted silicon-on-insulator (FD-SOI) process technologies for critical U.S. industries, including aerospace, defense, and automotive. This proposed investment also includes commitments to collaborate with the U.S. Department of Defense.\n\nSamsung has a proven record of workforce engagement in Texas, including robust partnerships with local education institutions \u2014 such as Austin Community College, The University of Texas at Austin, Texas A&M University, Texas State Technical College, Temple College, Manor High School and Taylor High School \u2014 to train its future semiconductor workforce. The proposed CHIPS investment also includes up to $40 million in dedicated workforce funding. Additionally, to attract and maintain the skilled workforce necessary for its projects, Samsung is exploring options in collaboration with the Department to build supply and defray the cost of high-quality and accessible child care for its employees.\n\nSamsung\u2019s waste management efforts at its Austin site have received the Zero Waste to Landfill Gold Level certification for recycling or reusing 96% of waste and its wastewater pretreatment practices have received longstanding recognition from the City of Austin. The Taylor site would use leading-edge sustainability strategies to promote carbon-free electricity use, conserve water resources, and avoid or reduce other impacts to the environment.\n\nIn addition to the proposed direct funding of up to $6.4 billion, the company has indicated that it plans to claim the U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Investment Tax Credit, which is expected to cover up to 25% of qualified capital expenditures.\n\nAs explained in its first Notice of Funding Opportunity, the Department may offer applicants a PMT on a non-binding basis after satisfactory completion of the merit review of a full application. The PMT outlines key terms for a CHIPS incentives award, including the amount and form of the award. The award amounts are subject to due diligence and negotiation of a long-form term sheet and award documents and are conditional on the achievement of certain milestones. After the PMT is signed, the Department begins a comprehensive due diligence process on the proposed projects and continues negotiating or refining certain terms with the applicant. The terms contained in the long-form term sheet and the final award documents may differ from the terms of the PMT being announced today.\n\nAbout CHIPS for America\n\nThe Department has received more than 630 statements of interest, more than 180 pre-applications and full applications for NOFO 1, and more than 160 small supplier concept plans for NOFO 2. The Department is continuing to conduct rigorous evaluation of applications to determine which projects will advance U.S. national and economic security, attract more private capital, and deliver other economic benefits to the country. The announcement with Samsung is the sixth PMT announcement the Department of Commerce has made under the CHIPS and Science Act, with additional PMT announcements expected to follow throughout 2024.\n\n\n\nCHIPS for America is part of President Biden\u2019s economic plan to invest in America, stimulate private sector investment, create good-paying jobs, make more in the United States, and revitalize communities left behind. CHIPS for America includes the CHIPS Program Office, responsible for manufacturing incentives, and the CHIPS Research and Development Office, responsible for R&D programs, that both sit within the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) at the Department of Commerce. NIST promotes U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness by advancing measurement science, standards, and technology in ways that enhance economic security and improve our quality of life. NIST is uniquely positioned to successfully administer the CHIPS for America program because of the bureau\u2019s strong relationships with U.S. industries, its deep understanding of the semiconductor ecosystem, and its reputation as fair and trusted.

        "text": "The Comstock Act: Implications for Abortion Care Nationwide\nKey Takeaways\n\nThe Comstock Act \u2013 an 1873 anti-vice law banning the mailing of obscene matter and articles used to produce abortion \u2013 could be used by a future presidential administration opposed to abortion rights to sharply restrict abortion nationwide. A literal interpretation of the Act could potentially also apply to materials used to produce all abortions, not just medication abortions; would not have exceptions; and could affect other medical care, such as miscarriage management.\n\nThe Biden Administration\u2019s Department of Justice has determined the Comstock Act only applies when the sender intends for the material or drug to be used for an illegal abortion, and because there are legal uses of abortion drugs in every state including to save the life of the pregnant person, there is no way to determine the intent of the sender. This interpretation, however, is not binding on future administrations.\n\nAnti-abortion organizations have asked federal courts to interpret the Comstock Act as a ban on the mailing and distribution of mifepristone\u2013 one of two drugs in the medication abortion regimen. While former President Trump has not publicly endorsed the enforcement of the Comstock Act, enforcement of the law has been outlined as a strategy recommended by conservative and anti-abortion leadership and may emerge as a key issue in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nThe current law has been revised by Congress three times since it was passed, and prior efforts to remove the abortion references from the law have failed to garner sufficient legislative support. There are renewed efforts in the current Congress to repeal the law, but they face long odds given the current composition of the Congress.\n\nIntroduction\n\nAbortion looms large in the 2024 presidential election with 1 in 8 voters saying abortion is most important to their vote. While Congress is unlikely to pass any abortion laws either protecting or restricting abortion, there is already a dormant law on the books that a future administration might seek to enforce. The Comstock Act \u2013 an 1873 anti-vice law banning the mailing and receiving of obscene matter, as well as articles used to produce abortions \u2013 could be used to sharply restrict abortion nationwide. In the aftermath of the Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs decision, anti-abortion activists have argued in federal court that the Comstock Act prohibits the mailing of the medication abortion pill, mifepristone, directly to patients, as well as the general distribution of the medication to physicians, hospitals, and pharmacies. A handful of cities and counties have passed local ordinances requiring their residents to comply with Comstock, making it unlawful to mail and/or receive abortion medications and \u201cabortion related paraphernalia.\u201d A literal interpretation of the 1873 law would have a far-reaching impact on the availability of abortion nationwide.\n\nThe Biden Administration\u2019s Department of Justice (DOJ) maintains that this law should not be interpreted literally and therefore has not enforced it. However, the DOJ of an administration that is hostile to abortion, as is the presumed Republican candidate Donald Trump, may interpret the Comstock Act differently and choose to prosecute those who send or receive materials distributed for abortion care. In the recent oral argument for a case involving the FDA\u2019s approval and regulation of the abortion drug mifepristone, Justices Alito and Thomas signaled that they would likely uphold the enforcement of the Comstock Act inviting future attention by the Courts. This brief provides background on the Comstock Act, reviews how it has been interpreted by the Biden Administration\u2019s DOJ, and considers how it could be enforced by an administration that is hostile toward abortion to severely restrict the distribution of drugs and supplies used for abortion, with implications for abortion access in all states across the country.\n\nWhat Are the Origins of the Comstock Act?\n\nIn 1873 \u2013 at the behest of anti-vice crusader, Anthony Comstock \u2013 Congress enacted a law banning the interstate mailing and receiving of \u201cobscene, lewd, or lascivious\u201d writings, or \u201cany article or thing designed or intended for the prevention of conception or procuring an abortion.\u201d In 1909, Congress enacted a similar law banning the use of express company or common carrier (such as FedEx or UPS) to mail \u201cany drug, medicine, article, or thing designed, adapted, or intended for preventing conception or producing abortion, or for any indecent or immoral use.\u201d These laws came to be known collectively as the Comstock Act. The scope of what constituted obscene or lewd material was far broader at the time, and in the late 1800s and early 1900s, the Comstock Act was used to prosecute a wide array of violations. These ranged from intent to mail magazines that detailed birth control methods, to the mailing of condoms and medical textbooks with illustrations of human anatomy, and even the mailing of letters discussing dating among unmarried people.\n\nOver the last century, the application and enforcement of the Comstock Act has changed drastically and it has not been applied to the mailing of abortion materials in the last fifty years. In the 1930s, federal appeals courts ruled that the Act did not apply to the mailing of contraceptive materials if their intended use was not illegal. Federal court rulings throughout the years also limited the reach of the obscenity provisions. In 1930, a federal appeals court ruled that sex education materials did not inherently violate the Comstock Act and two Supreme Court rulings \u2013 one from 1957 and another from 1971 \u2013 narrowed the scope of material that is considered obscene, limiting the reach of the Act.\n\nCongress has only amended the U.S. Code in a way that meaningfully affects these sections few times over the years. Following the landmark Supreme Court ruling in Griswold v. Connecticut (1965), Congress removed the references to contraception from the Comstock laws in 1971. In 1996, Section 1462 was extended to prohibit the sending of obscene materials through the internet. That same year \u2013 and in three subsequent years (1997, 1999, and 2001) \u2013 lawmakers introduced bills to remove the abortion language from the Comstock Act, but these proposed laws never made it out of committee or received a floor vote.\n\nAlthough the reach of the Comstock Act has been severely limited since its enactment, most of the original act remains in the United States Code as Sections 1461 and 1462 of Title 18. Section 1461 declares as nonmailable matter:\n\n\u201cEvery article or thing designed, adapted, or intended for producing abortion, or for any indecent or immoral use; and\n\nEvery article, instrument, substance, drug, medicine, or thing which is advertised or described in a manner calculated to lead another to use or apply it for producing abortion, or any indecent or immoral purpose . . .\u201d\n\nSection 1462 prohibits express companies or other common carriers from sending \u201cany drug, medicine, article or thing designed, adapted, or intended for producing abortion.\u201d\n\nHow Has the Biden Administration Approached Enforcement Post-Dobbs?\n\nAlthough violations of most federal crimes are under the purview of the Department of Justice and its agencies, the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) also has partial authority to enforce the law. Due to its involvement in enforcing the Act, after the Supreme Court released its opinion in Dobbs, the General Counsel of the USPS asked the DOJ to address whether the Comstock Act criminalizes the mailing of mifepristone, one of the two medications used in the medication abortion regimen.\n\nIn response, the DOJ released a slip opinion, concluding that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 \u00a71461 and 1462 \u2013 the Comstock Act \u2013 \u201cdoes not prohibit the mailing, or delivery or receipt by mail, of mifepristone or misoprostol where the sender lacks the intent that the recipient of the drugs will use them unlawfully.\u201d In support of its opinion, the DOJ cites federal appeals courts\u2019 decisions from 1930s cases regarding the mailing of condoms and other articles that may be used as contraceptives, and information about contraceptives. In these cases, the courts held that these items had legal uses under state law and the mailing of these items is not illegal if the sender does not intend for them to be used unlawfully.\n\nAdditionally, the DOJ notes that because this more limited construction of the Comstock Act came long before the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in Griswold (1965) and Roe (1973) \u2013 the latter of which recognized a constitutional right to abortion \u2013 it is not dependent on the Court\u2019s \u201crecognition of constitutional rights regarding the prevention or termination of pregnancy.\u201d In other words, the Court\u2019s reversal of Roe does not change the applicability of Comstock, because appeals courts had been interpreting it in a much more limited fashion before the Court recognized a right to abortion.\n\nAnti-Abortion Advocates\u2019 Recent Reliance on the Comstock Act to Attempt to Limit Access to Abortion\n\nAlliance for Hippocratic Medicine v. FDA\n\nAmong other claims they make about FDA\u2019s approval of mifepristone, plaintiffs in this case argue that the FDA violated the Comstock Act when it approved the medication and its distribution, and when it modified the rules to prescribe and dispense, removing the in-person dispensing requirement and allowing mifepristone to be mailed directly to patients. Danco \u2013 the manufacturer of Mifeprex, the original brand of mifepristone that was approved in 2000 \u2013 and the FDA argues that the Biden DOJ\u2019s interpretation of Comstock is correct, and that the mailing of mifepristone is not illegal if the sender did not intend for the medication to be used illegally. Neither the District Court for the Northern District of Texas, where this case originated, nor the Fifth Circuit Court, ruled on the Comstock arguments in the case. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments on March 26, 2024, and while it seems the court may hold that the plaintiff doctors and organizations do not have legal standing, Justices Alito and Thomas raised questions about the applicability of the Comstock Act. Justice Alito asked Solicitor General Prelogar, representing the FDA, why the FDA had not contended with the law in its decisions on expanding access to mifepristone through the mail. \u201cThis is a prominent provision. It\u2019s not some obscure subsection of a complicated, obscure law,\u201d Justice Alito said. \u201cEverybody in this field knew about it.\u201d Justice Thomas asked the lawyer representing Danco, the manufacturer, how she responds to an argument that mailing mifepristone and advertising it would violate the Comstock Act. These Justices seemed to be signaling that they would uphold enforcement of the Comstock Act if a future administration prosecutes the distribution and mailing of mifepristone and a challenge is brought to the Supreme Court.\n\n2023 REMS and Letter from Attorneys General about Mailing Mifepristone\n\nAfter the 2023 change to the Mifepristone Risk Evaluation Mitigation Strategies (REMS), which allowed certified pharmacies to dispense Mifepristone, and the subsequent announcements from Walgreens and CVS that they would dispense the medication through their pharmacies in states where abortion is legal, the Attorneys General from 20 different states sent a letter to Walgreens and CVS executives stating that federal law \u2013 through the Comstock Act \u2013 criminalizes the mailing of medication abortion. Federal crimes are under the purview of the federal government through its law enforcement agencies. Despite this, the letter from the Attorneys General argues that they have the ability to enforce the Comstock Act. In making this argument, they rely on the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). RICO\u2019s definition for racketeering activity includes a reference to the obscenity provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a71461-1465 \u2013 the section of the U.S. Code that contains the Comstock Act. RICO itself contains civil remedies, which allow persons injured in their business or property by a violation of the Act to sue in federal district court. The Attorneys General argue that this civil remedy provision in the law would allow them to bring a civil action against anyone who violates their interpretation of the Comstock Act.\n\nThe Comstock Act has never been used to prosecute someone for mailing or distributing mifepristone. Further, it does not appear that the provisions that pertain to abortion in the Comstock Act are applicable under RICO, since RICO\u2019s definition of racketeering specifically refers to the \u201cobscene matter\u201d provisions of the Comstock Act. And, the civil remedies are for persons injured by a violation of RICO, but it is unclear how the mailing of mifepristone would injure the business or property of a state. Still, this letter got considerable media attention. Walgreens and CVS have now begun to stock mifepristone in a handful of states and have indicated that they plan to expand to other states where it is permissible. This effectively limits the availability of the drug to states where abortion is not banned and where there is no state law limiting the dispensing of the drug in a pharmacy setting.\n\nCity and County Ordinances\n\nSince November 2022, five cities \u2013 one in Illinois and four in New Mexico \u2013 and three counties \u2013 all in New Mexico \u2013 have passed ordinances requiring their residents to comply with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 \u00a7 1461 and 1462, which they are interpreting as criminalizing the shipping and/or receiving of abortion medications and \u201cabortion related paraphernalia.\u201d These ordinances are unlike older ordinances banning abortion within city or county limits, because they purport to enforce federal law and, thus, per their defenders, take precedence over state law protecting the right to abortion.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation Project 2025\n\nThe Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, has released its vision for 2025, Mandate for Leadership, which \u201crepresents the work of more than 350 leading conservatives and outlines a vision of conservative success at each federal agency during the next administration.\u201d This blueprint includes a \u201cCampaign to Enforce the Criminal Prohibitions in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1461 and 1462 [The Comstock Act] Against Provider and Distributors of Abortion Pills that Use the Mail.\u201d\n\nCould the Comstock Act Be Used to Restrict Abortion Access Nationally?\n\nA future administration that is hostile to abortion rights may interpret the Comstock Act differently than the Biden Administration and could choose to prosecute those who send or receive materials used to cause abortions. Although many of the arguments presented by anti-abortion advocates focus on the mailing and distribution of mifepristone, a literal interpretation of the Comstock Act would implicate more than just this medication. It could also bar the distribution of misoprostol \u2013 the other drug used in the medication abortion regimen \u2013 and materials used in procedural abortions, such as dilators and suction catheters, and even gloves and speculums. This broad interpretation could also affect the distribution of medications that jeopardize pregnancies, even when they have other uses, such as methotrexate. A literal interpretation of the Comstock Act would criminalize sending and receiving shipments of any materials necessary to provide any kind of abortion care without exceptions, although it would be practically impossible to enforce.\n\nAn interpretation of the Comstock Act that bans the distribution of abortion medications and medical tools would also carry heavy implications for miscarriage management and other obstetric and gynecologic care, limiting clinicians\u2019 ability to manage these conditions and thus pose additional threats to the health of pregnant people. Medical treatment for miscarriage management is often the same as abortion care, and the same kinds of materials that are used to provide abortion are also used to provide other obstetric and gynecologic care. A literal reading of the Comstock Act would criminalize the mailing of materials that can be used to provide abortion care without differentiating or accounting for whether these materials will be \u2013 or are intended to be \u2013 used to provide abortions. This means that if a medication, article, or material can be used to provide abortion care, mailing it will be illegal regardless of the intent of the sender or the recipient.\n\nSince a literal application of the Comstock Act would have adverse effects on medical care well beyond abortion or pregnancy, and be nearly impossible to enforce, a future administration hostile to abortion may opt to enforce the Comstock Act selectively. The Project 2025 conservatives have proposed that the next DOJ enforce the Comstock Act by criminalizing the distribution of mifepristone or misoprostol or targeting enforcement on the distributors of abortion-related materials and abortion providers, with impacts in every state.\n\nAlternatively, a future administration could take an even more limited approach to restrict distribution and focus on the FDA\u2019s actions. Even if the Supreme Court were to dismiss the challenges to FDA\u2019s rules allowing for mifepristone to be mailed directly to patients, an anti-abortion administration may try to revoke this FDA policy and once again only permit doctors to dispense the drugs in-person to patients, citing it is a violation of the Comstock Act to mail the drug. Recent data suggests that 16% of abortions are medication abortions provided via telehealth where the drugs are mailed directly to patients following a telehealth consultation.\n\nOn the Horizon\n\nAbortion has emerged as a key issue in the 2024 presidential election, just as it has been in key state races since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. The Biden Administration\u2019s DOJ\u2019s opinion on the Comstock Act is not binding on future administrations. There is currently interest among abortion rights legislators in Congress to repeal the Comstock Act, but discussions are in the early stages and repeal is unlikely in a closely divided Congress. Unless the U.S. Supreme Court rules definitively on the applicability of the Comstock Act as it pertains to mailing materials used for abortions \u2013 or Congress amends the U.S. Code \u2013 a subsequent DOJ may interpret the law differently and seek to prosecute violations. While former President Donald Trump indicated that he supports allowing states to make the decisions about abortion availability, his campaign has not issued any statements pertaining to the Comstock Act or its enforcement. However, leading anti-abortion and conservative organizations that support Trump\u2019s candidacy have endorsed enforcement of the Comstock Act, also referred to as 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a71461 and 1462, in their blueprint for the 2025 presidential transition. While all eyes were on the Supreme Court before the Dobbs decision, the next president could take administrative actions to limit abortion access throughout the country, including in states where abortion is currently legal and protected.",

        "text": "Analysis: Donald Trump\u2019s first criminal trial is a historic and solemn moment for America\nCNN \u2014\n\nThe United States will cross a historic threshold on Monday when for the first time a former president goes on criminal trial in a case laced with fateful significance because Donald Trump could be back in the Oval Office next year.\n\nWhen the presumptive GOP nominee walks into court for the start of jury selection, he and the country will enter a new state of reality as legal and political worlds collide in a trial almost guaranteed to deepen Americans\u2019 bitter ideological estrangement.\n\nThe trial, related to hush money payments to an adult film actress before the 2016 election, will mark yet another extraordinary twist in the story of Trump, whose incessant testing of the limits of presidential decorum and the law has caused nearly nine years of political tumult and may still have years left to run. It raises the possibility that, depending on the jury\u2019s verdict, the Republican nominee in the 2024 presidential election could be a convicted felon. And given the case\u2019s subject matter \u2014 details about a payment to a woman who alleged that she had a sexual relationship with Trump, which he denies \u2014 it could reflect poorly on Trump\u2019s character and ethics as voters weigh their decisions in November.\n\nHush money payments are not illegal. Trump is accused of falsifying business records to keep unflattering information that could have hurt his campaign from the voters in an alleged early example of election interference. The fact that this case stems from alleged personal conduct means that it could have a lesser political impact than Trump\u2019s three other looming trials, which are rooted in greater constitutional and legal concerns pertinent to the powers of the presidency.\n\nBut the success of the ex-president\u2019s legal delaying tactics in the other cases \u2014 related to his attempts to overturn the 2020 election and hoarding of classified documents \u2014 means the hush money trial may be the only one to take place before the election. And Trump \u2014 though he is entitled to the presumption of innocence and the airing of evidence like any other defendant \u2014 is showing signs of increasing agitation at the prospect of the trial and the indignity it represents for someone who used to be the most powerful man in the world.\n\nStill, if he had to choose only one of the quartet of cases to reach a conclusion before the election, it would be this one.\n\nThe United States, unlike democracies that have been historically less stable, is not a nation accustomed to seeing its former heads of state on trial. While the circumstances of this case and Trump\u2019s broader legal troubles are unique, this new precedent does open the possibility that it will be less of a leap for future presidents to be pursued by legal investigations. Indeed, Trump has already warned that if he wins in November, he will dedicate his second presidency to \u201cretribution\u201d and will use the powers of the presidency to go after his foes, including the Biden family.\n\nNone of this is remotely normal. But it is all part of the extreme political, legal and constitutional challenges that Trump constantly poses to US institutions and that he is signaling would intensify if he wins a second term. The incessant cacophony stirred by his volcanic personality is by design \u2014 it makes it hard for Americans to process each distinct Rubicon that is crossed.\n\nTrump has sought to taint the trial before it even begins\n\nThe former president has made fervent attempts to delegitimize the case, the judge and the legal system itself \u2014 partly to hedge against any future guilty verdicts. He has blasted Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat who is leading the prosecution, as politically biased. And Judge Juan Merchan expanded a gag order after Trump named his daughter, who has done work for Democrats, on social media.\n\nWhile the trial will not be televised, it is bound to be a national spectacle over the period of six weeks to two months that it is expected to last. In his previous civil trials, including a massive fraud case that went against him, Trump has used court breaks to stage free rolling and often angry televised news conferences, seeking to attack the probity of the court and to air issues in the case. He has often been an obstreperous defendant, infringing the behavioral codes of the courtroom and infuriating judges. At one point during the civil fraud trial, Judge Arthur Engoron admonished Trump for turning the courtroom into the campaign trail, and asked his attorney, \u201cCan you control your client?\u201d\n\nFor all of Trump\u2019s claims of unfair treatment by the legal system, many other defendants would likely have faced far harsher treatment for their attacks on trials, prosecutors and court officers.\n\nWhile the Manhattan trial is in session four days a week, the ex-president will be required to attend \u2014 at a time when President Joe Biden will be free to blitz swing states. This is one reason why Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign is running as much through the courtrooms as according to the traditional rhythms of a White House bid.\n\nTrump knows his fate is not his to control\n\nThe moment Trump shows up in the courtroom on Monday will be one of unfathomable drama and a test for members of the pool of citizens who will be vetted for service on a jury like none other in American history. \u201cHe\u2019s the most famous person in the world. And when you\u2019ve come face-to-face with somebody that\u2019s got that kind of charisma, that kind of power, it tends to be intimidating, it tends to be shocking, it tends to be exciting,\u201d Robert Hirschhorn, a jury and trial consultant, said on CNN on Friday.\n\nThe task of finding jurors who lack strong opinions and prejudices against a defendant and the legal system, who can serve for a prolonged period and will make judgements solely based on the law and the evidence, is complex in any case. Because the accused is Trump, legal experts are predicting that jury selection could take as long as a week or more, which must conclude before prosecutors lay out their opening arguments against the former president.\n\nBut as he contemplates the beginning of his trial, Trump appears to be gleaning an understanding that his fate is now out of his hands and will be soon in those of 12 anonymous citizens whom he will not be allowed to bully, persuade or politicize. \u201cJury selection is largely luck. It depends who you get. It\u2019s very unfair that I\u2019m having a trial there,\u201d Trump said on Friday, alluding to New York City\u2019s liberal lean.\n\nTrump is already seeking to turn the trial into a circus to further his merged legal defense and chief campaign argument that he\u2019s being persecuted by \u201cderanged prosecutors\u201d trying to bar his return to the Oval Office. He branded himself as a \u201cproud political dissident\u201d at the Conservative Political Action Conference in February and has compared himself to South African anti-apartheid hero Nelson Mandela and dead Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny. On Saturday night in the swing state of Pennsylvania, Trump promised, \u201cI will be fighting for the freedom of 325 million Americans,\u201d as he embarked on an unprecedented shuttle between a criminal trial and the campaign trail. On Sunday, he used his Truth Social network to blast \u201ca blatant and unprecedented attack\u201d against his campaign and claimed that Biden coordinated with Bragg. There is no evidence that this is true.\n\nTrump\u2019s arguments are convincing to many Republican voters who embraced his narrative of persecution and made him their nominee in quick time this year. But will he be able to convince undecided general election voters that he\u2019s a victim, or will his first trial thicken a cloud of criminality that could doom his White House hopes and improve Biden\u2019s chances of landing a second term? Some polls have shown that a minority of Republican voters might have pause about voting for the ex-president if he is found guilty after a trial. But the circumstances are so unusual that it is impossible to predict how the politics of a conviction or an acquittal could play out.\n\nPolitical uncertainty over the case is being exacerbated by the charged backdrop. There is no clear leader in national polling in the race between Biden and Trump, which is likely to be decided by thousands of votes in a handful of battleground states. The president\u2019s prospects are being challenged by high interest rates and elevated prices that are causing pain for millions of Americans. Biden spent the weekend presiding over a successful defense of Israel after Iran sent hundreds of missiles and drones toward the Jewish state as fears of a wider Middle East war spiked. The deteriorating situation could bolster Trump\u2019s claims the world is spinning out of control under his successor\u2019s watch. That means that this and any future Trump trials \u2014 while a never-before-seen interruption to a presidential election campaign \u2014 may be only one factor that decides the destiny of the White House in November.\n\nProsecutors have telegraphed their case but Trump\u2019s team is yet to show its cards\n\nTrump is charged in Manhattan with falsifying business records to cover up a hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels in what prosecutors said was an attempt to interfere in the 2016 election. Trump has pleaded not guilty and has denied having an affair with Daniels.\n\n\u201cManhattan is home to the country\u2019s most significant business market. We cannot allow New York businesses to manipulate their records to cover up criminal conduct,\u201d Bragg wrote as he unveiled the indictment \u2014 Trump\u2019s first \u2014 in April 2023. \u201cThe trail of money and lies exposes a pattern that, the People allege, violates one of New York\u2019s basic and fundamental business laws.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s supporters claim that he\u2019s a victim of selective and politicized justice because he is being prosecuted over what they contend is a novel legal theory in a case stemming from personal embarrassments and campaign finance infringements. But Bragg\u2019s framing of the case identifies a common theme with Trump\u2019s other indictments: Is a president accountable to the same laws as every other citizen, or he is above the law?\n\n\u201cThis payment was made to deprive voters of essential information, which in turn was covered up with the intent to affect an election. \u2026 That\u2019s the allegation \u2013 deceiving voters to grasp power,\u201d said Norm Eisen, a CNN legal analyst and author of the new book \u201cTrying Trump: A Guide to His First Election Interference Criminal Trial.\u201d\n\nEisen added: \u201cNow, Alvin Bragg might not prove it \u2014 but that is why this is an alleged election interference case.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s attorneys have argued that this trial should be delayed until the Supreme Court rules on his sweeping claims of presidential immunity arising from the federal election interference case brought by special counsel Jack Smith. While the initial conduct at issue in this case took place before Trump was president, prosecutors argue that he signed off on the alleged cover-up to reimburse his lawyer Michael Cohen for phony legal services while president.\n\nAs part of a desperate flurry of filings designed to postpone accountability in the hush money case, the former president has also been claiming that he cannot get a fair trial in New York \u2014 the city where he made his name but that has overwhelmingly voted against him. Merchan has declined efforts by the president\u2019s attorneys to get the trial relocated to a jurisdiction where voters may be more favorable to Trump.\n\nThe former president is charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in the first degree. If convicted, he could face probation or a maximum sentence of 1 1/3 to 4 years on each count in state prison. Many legal experts believe that, as a first offender, Trump would not face jail time, or that if he did, any custodial sentences would run concurrently.\n\nTrump\u2019s attorneys have not tipped their hand over possible defenses. But it\u2019s almost certain they will attack the credibility and personal testimony of both Cohen and Daniels. Cohen will face criticism for being an unreliable witness after spending time in prison after being convicted of tax offenses, of lying to Congress and other offenses.",

        "summary": " For the first time in Gallup polling since 2001, 57% of U.S. adults say they would feel better if they got more sleep . 42% say they get as much sleep as they need; this is nearly a reversal of the figures last measured in 2013 . In 1942, 59% were getting eight-plus hours of sleep, while only 3% reported getting five hours or less .",
        "text": "Americans Sleeping Less, More Stressed\nWomen, particularly those under age 50, report sleeping less than they need and higher stress levels than men\n\nWASHINGTON, D.C. -- For the first time in Gallup polling since 2001, a majority of U.S. adults, 57%, say they would feel better if they got more sleep, while 42% say they get as much sleep as they need. This is nearly a reversal of the figures last measured in 2013, when 56% of Americans got the sleep they needed and 43% did not.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nAmericans\u2019 perception that they aren\u2019t getting enough sleep is borne out by the diminished number of hours of sleep they report getting per night.\n\nThese differences in average sleep reflect substantial changes over time in the percentage of U.S. adults sleeping eight or more versus five hours or less per night. In 1942, 59% were getting eight-plus hours of sleep, while only 3% reported getting five hours or less. By 1990, the percentage reporting eight or more hours had fallen to 27%, while the proportion getting five or less was up to 14%. Today, a quarter are still getting eight-plus hours, but the percentage getting five or less has risen to 20%.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nThe latest results are from a Dec. 1-20, 2023, Gallup poll.\n\nYoung Women Least Likely to Get Enough Sleep\n\nWomen have been consistently less likely than men to report getting enough sleep. The latest poll finds 36% of women versus 48% of men saying they get the sleep they need. Both figures represent significant declines from previous readings in 2013 and 2004 and are the lowest Gallup has measured for each group to date.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nGenerally, adults 65 and older are more likely than those who are younger to get the sleep they need. This holds true across the trend. That said, the decline this year in getting as much sleep as needed holds for all age groups, though it is less pronounced among young adults, aged 18 to 29. All other groups show declines in excess of 10 percentage points.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nYounger women, at 27%, are much less likely than other age-by-gender groups to report getting adequate sleep. Younger men, at 46%, and older women, at 44%, are about equally likely to report getting adequate sleep, while older men, as is typical, are most likely to do so, with 51% getting the sleep they need in 2023.\n\nGiven that the percentage of young women getting enough sleep is so much lower than for other groups, the gender gap is much larger among younger than older adults. In 2023, there is a 19-point difference between women and men aged 18 to 49, while the gap between women and men aged 50 and older is seven points.\n\nYounger men show only a modest drop in reporting getting adequate sleep over time, while a growing number of younger women aren\u2019t getting the sleep they need. In 2001, a slight majority of younger men, 54%, reported getting enough sleep, dropping to 46% in 2023. For younger women, 42% reported getting the sleep they need in 2001, while today, only 27% say so.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nAmericans More Stressed Today Than Three Decades Ago\n\nWhat might be driving these downward trends in sleep? Research on health and wellness shows a strong connection between stress and sleep quality. According to the American Psychological Association, the relationship between sleep and stress goes both ways -- those who sleep less are more stressed, and those who are more stressed sleep less. Indeed, the new poll shows that 63% of those who report wanting more sleep say they frequently experience stress, compared with 31% of those who get the sleep they need.\n\nOver the past 30 years, the number of Americans who are stressed has been on a steady incline after a sharp drop in 2003. The most recent data show that nearly half of all Americans, 49%, report frequently experiencing stress, up 16 points over the past two decades and the highest in Gallup\u2019s trend to date.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nJust as with sleep, there continues to be a gap in stress levels between women and men in the U.S. That gap has fluctuated over time; it was narrowest between 2004 and 2007. However, over the past six years, the gap has grown. In 2023, 53% of women report frequently experiencing stress, compared with 45% of men.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nYounger women are the most likely of the four major gender-by-age groups to say they frequently experience stress, exceeding men their age by 14 points. They are also 29 points more likely than women 50 and older to report frequent stress.\n\nYounger women have also experienced the sharpest increase in frequent stress of the four groups, with their levels rising 23 points since 2007, compared with an eight-point increase among older women. By contrast, the levels of reported frequent stress have increased three points among younger men and five points among men 50-plus since 2007.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nImplications\n\nAmericans are sleeping less and are less satisfied with the amount they sleep. Reports of frequently feeling stressed are also on the rise. Gallup polling and other research show a strong connection between sleep, stress, and overall health. Thus, the impact of both of these trends on Americans\u2019 health could be substantial.\n\nThe decline in sleep and the increase in stress levels in the U.S. are consistently worse for younger women than for men and older women. This aligns with Gallup\u2019s data on mental health and wellbeing, which show that younger Americans and women seem to be suffering at greater rates. For example, depression is on the rise for women and younger adults, and women and younger Americans are more likely to evaluate their mental health as fair or poor compared with men and older adults. Furthermore, a recent Walton Family Foundation and Gallup study on Generation Z finds that getting enough sleep and relaxation play an important part in happiness among America\u2019s youth. Gen Z who report having enough time to sleep and relax are twice as likely to say they are happy as those who do not get enough sleep or relaxation.\n\nTo stay up to date with the latest Gallup News insights and updates, follow us on X.\n\nLearn more about how the Gallup Poll Social Series works.\n\n###Embeddable###",

He was flanked by poster boards with flow charts, but that was as far as the showmanship went.\n\nThe accusations he went on to level against Donald J. Trump were salacious, involving money paid to a porn star just before the 2016 presidential election so she would remain silent about her claim that they had sex a decade before. But Bragg studiously avoided mentioning sex or hush money during the 13-minute event, focusing instead on 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up the payment. Bragg looked frequently at his notes while he spoke, mostly in a monotone. He seemed unprepared (or unwilling) to answer the most obvious questions: why he had abandoned a different case, about whether Trump had falsified the valuations of properties, or why he thought he could make these new charges stick.",

Trump's criminal trial is related to the payment of $130,000 to Stormy Daniels in October 2016 . The money was given by the former President\u2019s then-lawyer Michael Cohen in exchange for her silence about a sexual encounter she allegedly had with Trump in 2006 .",
        "text": "Trump becomes first former US President to face criminal trial: What is the hush money payment case?\nDonald Trump became the first former US President to face a criminal trial on Monday (April 15) in a case that involves paying hush money to adult movie actress Stormy Daniels. The trial could keep Trump tied up in court for weeks and affect his campaign to once again win the White House.\n\nThe trial began with selecting the jury that would decide Trump\u2019s fate. The process could take up to two weeks or more. The development came more than a year after Trump was first indicted in the case in March 2023. Prosecutors said the former President faced 34 counts of falsifying business records.\n\nHere is a look at the case.\n\nWhat is the hush money payment case?\n\nTrump\u2019s criminal trial is related to the payment of $130,000 to Daniels in October 2016, in the final weeks of the presidential campaign. The money was given by the former President\u2019s then-lawyer Michael Cohen in exchange for her silence about a sexual encounter she allegedly had with Trump in July 2006. Cohen funded the payment through a home equity line of credit and was reimbursed later by Trump through his company, the Trump Organization.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter initially denying any knowledge of the transaction between Cohen and Daniels, Trump admitted to reimbursing Cohen for the payment, which he called a \u201csimple private transaction\u201d.\n\nThis happened in 2018, the same year in which Cohen pleaded guilty to charges including federal campaign finance crimes involving the hush money, and testified that Trump and his company had falsely classified the purpose of the payments by labelling them as legal expenses. This led federal prosecutors to conclude that the money given to Daniels was \u201can improper donation\u201d to Trump\u2019s campaign, media reports including in The New York Times said. In the days that followed, the DA\u2019s office began its probe into the matter, focusing on Trump\u2019s role in the transaction.\n\nAlso in Explained | Donald Trump held liable for sexual abuse, defamation: What the civil case against him was about\n\nWhat laws has Trump broken?\n\nMaking a false entry in a company\u2019s records is against New York state law. Falsifying business records on its own is a misdemeanour, but it can be elevated to a felony if prosecutors prove that the records were falsified to conceal another crime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn this case, the other crimes include violation of election law, \u201cunder the theory that the payout served as a donation to Mr Trump\u2019s campaign because it silenced Ms Daniels and shut down a potential sex scandal in the final stretch of the campaign,\u201d The NYT reported last year.\n\nWhat is the maximum sentence if Trump is convicted?\n\nAll the charges against Trump are Class E felonies \u2014 the lowest category of felonies in New York. Each of the 34 counts carries a maximum prison sentence of four years. But it isn\u2019t necessary that Trump would be thrown behind bars even if he is convicted by a jury. The NYT report said there is nothing in the law that requires the judge to sentence Trump to prison after he is convicted. The judge could sentence Trump to probation only.",

Swan and Taylor Agajanian \u2014 about the ways Instagram influencers profit from anti-vaccine misinformation. Moran-Prestridge was also interviewed about the article\u2019s findings for Oregon Public Broadcasting \u201cThink Out Loud\u201d program .\n\nIn January, the UW Population Health Initiative spotlighted Moran-Prestridge\u2019s contributions to \u201cUntangling abortion misinformation and its impacts on healthcare providers,\u201d a project with CIP colleagues initially funded through a PopHealth Tier 1 Pilot Grant that examined the influence abortion myths have on the work of abortion healthcare providers and other health professionals from related fields in the Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana and Idaho (WWAMI) region.\n\nRESEARCH IN FOCUS: GENERATIVE AI\n\nIn a commentary, UW Information School doctoral student Shahan Ali Memon and associate professor Jevin West explain that \u201csearch engines are already answering queries with error-laden, generated content, further blurring the provenance of information and impacting the integrity of the information ecosystem,\u201d argue that all these factors could reduce the reliability of search engines, and summarize some of the active research directions and open questions.\n\nRead the commentary, \u201c Search engines post-ChatGPT: How generative artificial intelligence could make search less reliable \u201d\n\n***\n\n\n\nCan provenance save us from a barrage of synthetic media?\n\nThrough work with the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA), UW researchers found that provenance can help better calibrate trust and accuracy perceptions of media.

Despite the necessary caution, West noted the importance of letting people, including students, interact and experiment with generative artificial intelligence. \u201cI think we have to lean into the critical side, and we should be concerned about the ways in which it can disrupt things like democracies,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we also should allow the creative world \u2014 and in our case, it\u2019s the students \u2014 to interact with this as long as they understand the implications of what they\u2019re doing with the technology and the ways in which it can be misused.\u201d\n\n\n\nImage above generated by You.com\u2019s Create mode.\n\n\n\nCIP IN THE NEWS\n\nIn an interview with The Guardian, CIP director and co-founder Kate Starbird, a UW Human Centered Design & Engineering associate professor who is studying rumors and misinformation around the 2024 U.S. elections, said that she, as The Guardian writes, \u201cfears that the election fraud narrative has now \u2018sunk in\u2019 so deeply for so many Americans on the right that it could end up creating worse laws and procedures \u2014 and actually increase the possibility of a successful foreign interference campaign in U.S. elections.\u201d\n\n***",

        "text": "Ralph Nader Would Like to Stop Having to Explain Why the Spoiler Coverage Is Stupid\nFrustrated by the two-party system? Polling shows you\u2019re not alone, with more Americans than ever supporting the idea of a third party. But the winner of November\u2019s presidential election will be either Biden or Trump, and voters weighing other candidates need to consider if a protest vote to end the duopoly might instead help end our democracy. In the May+June 2024 issue, we examine the past and present of third-party outsiders, and how they could upend this year\u2019s race. You can read all the pieces here.\n\nIn 1990, frustrated with our democracy, Ralph Nader wrote an article for Mother Jones about the obvious need for a \u201cnew politics.\u201d The crusading consumer advocate, famous enough to have hosted Saturday Night Live, warned that \u201cgrowing poverty\u201d and \u201cbureaucratic rigidity\u201d were among a \u201clitany\u201d of issues plaguing America. But, more than any specific policy, Nader bemoaned a system\u2014full of broken institutions and entrenched powerbrokers\u2014that silenced common people\u2019s demands for a better nation. Still, Nader saw some hope in the decade to come: \u201cThe nineties promise to be a time of pent-up consumer and citizen frustration,\u201d Nader wrote, \u201c[that] if joined to a new, modernized assortment of political tools, could fuel a new political movement for a real democracy.\u201d\n\nMore than 30 years later, the 90-year-old Nader is still waiting\u2014frustrated, and occasionally incredulous\u2014for a revolution that never arrived. The 1990s did not give America Nader\u2019s longed-for mass movement. In fact, something like the opposite occurred. Bill Clinton\u2019s so-called New Democrats shifted the party rightward, upending Nader\u2019s vision of New Deal, populist engagement.\n\n\u201cGo back to the Mother Jones articles,\u201d Nader said earlier this year, when I called to discuss third-party politics in the 2024 election, referencing the series of columns he wrote in 1990 for this magazine. Everything he wrote back then, Nader explained on the phone, still needs to happen.\n\nFor years, Nader was a respectable rapscallion of the Beltway. He rose to fame in 1965, with his book attacking General Motors, Unsafe at Any Speed. The young, telegenic lawyer identified horrific safety inadequacies in the corporate behemoth\u2019s cars, especially \u201cthe sporty Corvair.\u201d In retaliation, General Motors executives hired a law firm that, in turn, hired a former FBI agent who spied on Nader. \u201cOur job,\u201d his antagonists wrote in a letter at the time, is to look into Nader\u2019s \u201cfriends, his women, boys, etc., drinking, dope, jobs, in fact, all facets of his life.\u201d After the spying came to light, the appalling tactics used against him propelled Nader to further fame, which he then leveraged to spur congressional action. It worked. In 1966, Congress passed the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act.\n\nThis accomplishment became a model for Nader\u2019s future work: Find a problem, expose it in the press, use media pressure to bring about congressional hearings, and then push for specific legislation. Throughout the 1960s and \u201970s, Nader and his famous \u201cRaiders\u201d\u2014a group of dorky college kids and young lawyers who wrote book-length policy briefings\u2014created a brand of consumer politics with clear policy outcomes: new regulations, new laws, even some new agencies. Nader\u2019s theory of change offered a palatable radicalism. Here was a tie-wearing wonk yelling about adjusting policy, unlike the long-haired hippies who had demanded revolution. His efforts resulted in the creation of some pillars of the regulatory state: the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Freedom of Information Act, and the Consumer Product Safety Act, among others. Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. famously groused in a 1971 memo to the Chamber of Commerce that Nader\u2019s PR campaign had made him \u201cperhaps the single most effective antagonist of American business.\u201d\n\nBut in the 1980s Ronald Reagan\u2019s rise in Washington was tantamount to a backlash against Nader\u2019s leftist visions. \u201cAt the same time, Congress began to weary of someone many members saw as an annoying Old Testament prophet,\u201d Mark Green, who was often a co-writer with Nader, explained in the Nation. \u201cAnd the media, too, moved on.\u201d\n\nMarginalized, Nader, who had famously not run for office, instead positioning himself as a citizen activist, finally lowered himself to electoral politics. In 1992, he launched a write-in campaign in both of the New Hampshire presidential primaries calling for Republicans and Democrats to vote for \u201cnone of the above.\u201d \u201cThe only way people will get their attention,\u201d Nader told the press, warning of complacent politicians, \u201cis to write in my name.\u201d (He won about 1 percent of the vote in the Democratic primary.)\n\nIn 1996, Nader again ran a half-hearted presidential campaign, loosely affiliated with the Green Party (he did not accept its platform but in some states ran on the Green ticket). And then in 2000, Nader went all in campaigning for the presidency in 50 states. The 97,488 votes he won in Florida would become a constant talking point\u2014and, in his mind a stalking horse\u2014in the debate over why Al Gore lost to George W. Bush. Since then, Nader has fought the label of the \u201cspoiler\u201d who\u2014as columnist Jonathan Chait notably argued\u2014put George W. Bush in the White House by siphoning votes from Gore. Nader has been adamant that suggesting that his run resulted in Al Gore\u2019s loss is ridiculous.\n\nIn recent years, Nader launched a print publication, the Capitol Hill Citizen. (\u201cOnline is a gulag of clutter, diversion, ads, intrusions, and excess abundance,\u201d he explained to Politico.) And he has continued to do what he has for much of his adult life: Bug reporters and tell them to stop trying to win awards and start covering committee hearings.\n\nI called the former presidential candidate and former Mother Jones contributor to talk about how he views the potential of third-party politics, the problem of the \u201clesser of two evils\u201d arguments, and the media\u2019s failures\u2014including mine.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWas there an exact moment when you decided that you would run for president in a serious way?\n\nIt became more and more difficult to get anything done in Washington. When Tony Coelho (D-Calif.) was head of the House Democratic reelection committee [in the early 1980s], he persuaded the party to go big for corporate PACs, to go to the receptions around Capitol Hill\u2014and started to quid pro quo. He said we can raise as much money as the Republicans, what are we waiting for?\n\nAnd you can see the decline in congressional hearings. They won fewer elections. Regulatory agencies didn\u2019t respond to our petitions for health safety standards. It was declining everywhere.\n\nSo year after year, you start asking yourself: What do you do when you get up in the morning? You can\u2019t get hearings anymore. It\u2019s getting harder to get through to members of Congress. The press doesn\u2019t pay any attention. If you don\u2019t get press, the members of Congress don\u2019t pay attention. It becomes a vicious circle.\n\nHey\u2014you gotta go into the political arena.\n\nBut we have a two-party duopoly that has huge fences around itself, erected by the corporate-conflicted political and media consultants\u2014which the progressive press has ignored enormously in recent years and who have taken over the Democratic Party. The idea behind third parties in the 19th century was you push one of the two parties\u2014or maybe both parties\u2014and they eventually adopt what you\u2019re pushing. And I learned that wasn\u2019t possible. The Democrats would respond not by moving in the direction of working for the people. They responded by scapegoating their losses onto the Green Party.\n\nThey\u2019re great scapegoaters\u2014they never look at themselves in the mirror.\n\nYou ran in every presidential election from 1992 until 2008. When did you realize that your path in electoral politics would lead to scapegoating?\n\nWhen the media blacked us out. Most people who knew my name as a consumer advocate didn\u2019t even know I was running. It\u2019s an impossible task. You can\u2019t do it. It\u2019s a two-party dictatorship. The media is heavily to blame for this, including the progressive media. They keep toting the Democratic Party line: They\u2019re not as bad as the Republicans. Which is true. They\u2019re not as bad as Republicans.\n\nBut they\u2019re both very bad\u2014by any level of reasonable civic expectation.\n\nAs you look back on the progressive \u201clesser of two evils\u201d argument, it seems this is always the way the press frames third-party politics. What is the problem with that?\n\n[This argument] doesn\u2019t start with the progressive agenda and empowering the people. It starts with which one is worse: Democrat or Republican? It doesn\u2019t start early enough and fundamentally enough, and that\u2019s the reason why the progressive press fell prey to the \u201canybody-but-the-GOP\u201d and made no demands on the Democrats. Like the labor unions, they endorse early, and they make no demands. Labor unions just endorsed Biden weeks ago\u2014with no demands to repeal Taft-Hartley, no demands for $15 or $20 minimum wage, no demands for anything. They just went, hey, this is not the time. I love that phrase. \u201cThis is not the time.\u201d If you go lesser-of-two-evils every four years, you\u2019re gonna go lower. A liberal Republican from the 1970s now would be considered a progressive Democrat. That\u2019s how far the Republicans have gone.\n\nThen the other thing that is even more disgraceful is they attack people like me. You know, the Nation attacked me. They attack people like me for carrying their progressive agenda. They\u2019re panicking. They don\u2019t even know how to hold out until a few days before the election to maximize their bargaining power.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing to watch the toadiness, the civility, the peonage. They\u2019re not even demanding scraps on the table\u2014not even demanding scraps.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s amazing to watch the toadiness, the civility, the peonage. They\u2019re not even demanding scraps on the table\u2014not even demanding scraps.\n\nIn 2024, we\u2019re looking at a race in which we have two deeply unpopular candidates, and there is no real infrastructure for third-party politics. Was the third-party option kneecapped or were you unable to build it during your runs?\n\nNow you\u2019re onto something very important. That\u2019s the problem. The Green Party doesn\u2019t run enough local candidates. You can\u2019t have a national campaign without local candidates. They have about 250 local candidates, usually every four years, out of thousands of opportunities\u2014you know, Zoning Commission, City Council, Board of Education. They\u2019re not serious. They just love to have their beliefs reaffirmed by whoever\u2019s on the stage and rah-rah them. They\u2019re not poor. They\u2019re middle to upper-middle class. But they don\u2019t raise enough money for full-time organizers in the field. The people who shout the most are the people who do the least work. Their main function is as scapegoats for the Democrats. Imagine the Democrats saying that Dr. Jill Stein cost Hillary the election. [Laughs.] It\u2019s a joke. They don\u2019t know anything about regression analysis, or a billion dollars of stupid ads, repeating ad infinitum: Donald Trump\u2019s not fit to be president, Donald Trump\u2019s not fit to be president. There was no ground game in Pennsylvania and Ohio. And that\u2019s the problem. They\u2019re prisoners of the political media consulting firms.\n\nDon\u2019t get me started.\n\nBut if the point of a third-party campaign is to push, and you are saying that third parties failed to help you do that, do you feel like you were able to push in your campaigns?\n\nNo, I wasn\u2019t able at all. I went to scores of fundraisers. I went to 50 states. I put on my stage people running for the Senate for the first time like Medea Benjamin. I did the whole nine yards. It didn\u2019t matter.\n\nIt seems as if you\u2019ve been defeated by the inadequacy of third-party politics, and yet also need to defend them. And it reminds me of some of your writing, including for us in the 1990s, about creating the tools for democracy and citizen activism. What is your assessment of the current state of democracy?\n\nDid you read the book Crashing the Party?\n\nI did.\n\nWell, I\u2019m being redundant, then. The problem with these third parties, compared to those in the 19th century, is they don\u2019t come from the people. You make a list of all the Green parties\u2014the so-called activists\u2014all of them have health insurance. I hardly met anybody who didn\u2019t have a good job, or a good retirement, or health insurance. What\u2019s not to like? They\u2019re not hurting. In the old days, they came out of being pummelled into poverty by the railroads and the banks. And then there were the Eugene Debs supporters. That\u2019s a way to build the third party.\n\nThe modern third parties get hit with \u201cspoilers\u201d by their friends: \u201cHey, you\u2019re supporting a spoiler. Do you want another GOP president like Bush?\u201d\n\nWhat are we spoiling? We\u2019re trying to go after a system that\u2019s spoiled to the core. You\u2019re calling me a spoiler? What am I doing to spoil anything? Other than exercising my First Amendment rights of speech, assembly, and petition to try to advance majoritarian agendas\u2014many of them supported by 70 to 80 percent of the American people, including a lot of conservatives. They don\u2019t even know how to argue the case. And don\u2019t get me started on foreign and military policy. Where they\u2019re clueless or they\u2019re not interested at all in the empire, or the military budget, or the slaughter of people, of civilians everywhere: Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Somalia, Yemen, Palestine. It\u2019s disgraceful.\n\nYou\u2019ve said \u201cspoiled to the core\u201d for years now. So if it\u2019s spoiled to the core and the third parties haven\u2019t been working to change that, I\u2019m still confused as to why you remain such an advocate for them.\n\nI\u2019m looking for a different third party\u2014like the one Tony Mazzocchi, the greatest labor leader of our generation\u2014envisioned. He came out of Long Island\u2014and during World War II he helped liberate the death camps. He comes back. He starts a union in a largely female factory. Then he goes into the Oil, Chemical, and Atomic Workers Union, and he gets them to oppose nuclear power\u2014even though they have workers in nuclear power. He comes down [to Washington, DC,] and works with me to get OSHA through. He gets scientists to connect with blue-collar workers on toxics in the workplace. He\u2019s everywhere. Then he started a party, but he didn\u2019t want to have candidates. He told me he wasn\u2019t interested in a 1 percent party. He said organize until you float a party where you can start getting 10 percent, 15 percent. But he never reached that because the unions he talked to were part of the Democratic surrender core. They couldn\u2019t out-argue him. Nobody out-argued Tony.\n\n\u201cThe first question is: Why isn\u2019t the Democratic Party and Biden 20 points ahead of a chronic liar, thief, crook, narcissist, smearer, slander, ignorant, stupid Trump and his followers? That\u2019s the question.\u201d\n\nI want to ask about 2024. It seems that the rhetoric of the \u201clesser of two evils\u201d is especially heightened\u2014\n\nWait a minute. It\u2019s the wrong question. It\u2019s the wrong question. The first question is: Why isn\u2019t the Democratic Party and Biden 20 points ahead of a chronic liar, thief, crook, narcissist, smearer, slanderer, ignorant, stupid Trump and his followers? That\u2019s the question. You don\u2019t take the dereliction of the party knuckling under their corporate political media people and start there. You start with: Why aren\u2019t they landsliding him? Do you know about the effort with Mark Green and me in 2022?\n\nI don\u2019t. Tell me\u2014\n\nYou know anything about WinningAmerica.net?\n\nI don\u2019t.\n\nSee, Jacob, no matter where you went, where you worked\u2014Arkansas, everywhere\u2014you\u2019re part of the problem.\n\nI\u2019m sure I am.\n\nGet on the computer right now\u2014go to WinningAmerica.net. On July 23, 2022, we offered the Democrats a huge presentation\u2014six and a half hours and only a handful showed up. We had 24 civic leaders. And the sons of bitches didn\u2019t even pick it up. Even though it was nominally endorsed by Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.), Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.), and Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.). But you couldn\u2019t get the queen, [then\u2013House Speaker Nancy] Pelosi, to even return calls. I knew her when she was 45 years old coming out of San Francisco\u2014didn\u2019t matter. She wouldn\u2019t endorse it.\n\nWe put out reports, we put out articles. I\u2019m gonna burn your ear, so be patient with me. The magazines don\u2019t even cover it. So I call the editors of the Nation, Mother Jones, In These Times, Washington Monthly, the Progressive\u2014lucky to even get a callback. I used to write for these publications before the editors were born. But they wouldn\u2019t even call back. You got to start digging deep, Jacob\u2014you got to dig deep into the malaise, the surrender, the low expectation level, the narcissism, the smugness of our side. We ought to be ashamed of ourselves. We have the most powerful arguments in American history, against the worst tyrants and corporate indentured servants in American history.\n\nSo why am I talking this way? Because you\u2019re like the 40th progressive reporter I\u2019ve talked to in three years, and they all write the same goddamn stuff: the same stupid, superficial stuff.\n\nWhat do they write?\n\nJust look at the articles: spoiler, third parties that elected Bush, Stein is a troublemaker\u2014on and on. The party line: Don\u2019t they know this is not the time? It\u2019s critical for democracy. We got to go with the Democrats. They don\u2019t challenge the Electoral College\u2014the Electoral College elected Trump, the Electoral College elected Bush. What are you doing scapegoating me and Stein?\n\nThere really is something deeply wrong. The press is part of the problem. You can\u2019t say they\u2019re ignorant. I give them stuff to read. They know what they can read. They come back with the same rubber-stamp articles. The latest one is Michael Scherer in the Washington Post. I must have talked to him for an hour and a half. Look at the stupid article he wrote and look at the even more erroneous headline that he wrote back a few weeks ago. And the guy was White House correspondent.\n\nYou had problems with that article?\n\nYeah, he immediately tried to maneuver me into\u2014after years of opposing the Democrats\u2014saying I\u2019m supporting Biden. Supporting Biden? The guy\u2019s a war criminal on steroids. The guy doesn\u2019t know the meaning of peace negotiations. He doesn\u2019t know the meaning of humanitarian aid. All he knows is shipping cluster bombs to Ukraine and 2,000-pound bombs to the Israeli war machine.\n\nIn the article, you mention we are stuck with Biden. But do you really feel that we\u2019re stuck with him?\n\nNo, the country\u2019s stuck with Biden. That doesn\u2019t mean I am. I never tell anybody how I vote. It intrudes on my communication, my access to people. They start pigeonholing you, stereotyping you, putting words in your mouth. I say to people: Vote your conscience. I\u2019m a Eugene Debs guy.\n\nIf you vote for Biden, he\u2019s never going to look back because he knows you have nowhere to go. If you want to vote for Biden\u2014hold off the vote until the last minute and get some concessions for heaven\u2019s sake.\n\nWell, let\u2019s talk about that. Specifically, what are the concessions right now that you think are most vital that the left should be pushing Biden for?\n\nHow much time do you have?\n\nWell, I think you have more hard-out on timing than I do, but I will\u2014\n\nGo to WinningAmerica.net. And look at my presentation. And you\u2019ll see a list so I don\u2019t have to repeat it.\n\nWhen talking with you and reading about you, it\u2019s clear that access to your message, and your ability to have the power to push, is so mixed with your belief of how to fix what\u2019s wrong. And that has led some to say that your campaigns are egotistical. Do you think the run in 2000 got in the way of your ability to advocate effectively for progressive policies in the past 20 to 30 years?\n\nThat\u2019s nothing more than an excuse. Even if I didn\u2019t run, they were going to marginalize me even worse. That\u2019s why I ran, because they were excluding our groups. We couldn\u2019t get our calls returned. I don\u2019t buy that.\n\nAfter 2000, Biden was on television. He said, \u201cNader better not come up here anymore.\u201d Can you imagine the arrogance of this guy? This is after Gore could have easily landslided this bumbling governor from Texas, who had a horrible record on children, pollution, poverty, you name it. He\u2019s got the gall to say\u2014and I laughed at the time to my friends. Look at this guy. He\u2019s trying to keep me out of Capitol Hill.\n\nI\u2019m not laughing now. They froze me out of almost every hearing.\n\nYou\u2019re connected deeply with consumerism, but that\u2019s not exactly the creed of the left now. Your time charts onto what people would call neoliberalism\u2014beginning under Carter, then growing with Reagan, and flourishing with Clinton. Do you think of yourself as someone who\u2019s critiquing capitalism? Or are you doing something different?\n\nIt\u2019s corporate capitalism that I\u2019m against. Not small business, Main Street, mom-and-pop capitalism. And the difference is far more than a difference in magnitude. It\u2019s the difference in the quality of power. There\u2019s no comparison between giant corporations and small businesses. So that\u2019s one. You can\u2019t have a society without markets. The key is to make them local, competitive, accountable, replaceable, accessible, sue-able, and so on. But the big corporations\u2014that\u2019s where progress falls down.\n\nMother Jones\u2014very good empirically. I mean, they really documented case studies of vicious behavior. But they don\u2019t go to the higher level. The higher level is: What do we do with these big corporations? One is we\u2019ve got to subordinate them constitutionally. So corporations should never have equal rights with real people. Now they\u2019re connecting with AI. You want a deadly cocktail? Connect artificial persons called corporations with AI.\n\nToo many progressive reporters don\u2019t know how to take it to an ideological level. I mean, I hate rigid ideologies. But if you don\u2019t take empirical reality and weave it into public philosophies, you\u2019re just gonna be spinning your wheels, exposing one skirmish after another of corporate crime, and going nowhere.\n\nYou think I\u2019m optimistic about this conversation with you, Jacob? You know, I have somebody here, listening to the conversation in a chair in the office. And you know what she\u2019s going to tell me? How do you have the patience to do this\u2014day after day after day\u2014and get the same output?\n\nThey don\u2019t dig. What you should do is buy yourself a shovel. And every time you\u2019re gonna do a similar superficial story, you say: I, Jacob Rosenberg, am not going to do the same shit story. Just look at the stuff in your magazines, what they ignore, what they go over. The Democratic Party line: \u201cleast worse,\u201d or \u201cthis is not the time.\u201d\n\nI really don\u2019t want to have these conversations anymore. Because I can\u2019t get through to people.\n\nI don\u2019t disagree with you. I find it frustrating that a lot of liberal press says \u201cleast worse.\u201d But I\u2019m also trying to understand if, when you ran as a third-party candidate, you felt that it was effective in changing the things you care about.\n\nI know what you\u2019re asking. The issue is what kind of third-party movements. It\u2019s not, oh, they don\u2019t work, let\u2019s drop them because they didn\u2019t mobilize, didn\u2019t connect with the people, didn\u2019t sweat, didn\u2019t raise money, didn\u2019t hire organizers. Show me a major movement in America that succeeded without organizers\u2014labor, civil rights environment. So the issue is that third parties are essential for a competitive democracy. You cannot have a democracy without being competitive. In other words, having forces being able to replace the entrenched incumbents.\n\nWhat do you make of something like No Labels, then, that uses the third-party system but takes a lot a money from rich people?\n\nI mean, they are nothing but an amorphous force to further entrench plutocracy, oligarchy, and imperialism. That\u2019s all. Lieberman. All you got to do is say, what do you think? Joe Lieberman.\n\nI wanted to ask about the third-party candidates who are running this year. What do you think of the Kennedy campaign?\n\nI don\u2019t know where he\u2019s going. The question you always ask of campaigns like that is: How many state ballots are they on? I don\u2019t know how many states he\u2019s on. If he\u2019s on just 10 to 15 states, it\u2019s just a speech effort.\n\nDo you think he\u2019s doing something positive in his campaign?\n\nYeah, he\u2019s enhancing the potential of their scapegoating. He could take more votes from the Republicans the way he\u2019s talking these days. Who knows where he is? He\u2019s a tragedy, unfortunately.\n\nI know you\u2019re constantly asked if you regret running in 2000. And I\u2019ve read your responses. But it seems clear that after 2000, in an example of what you describe as the scapegoating process, you were locked out of Capitol Hill in a significant way. That seems to have made life very hard for you\u2014\n\nYeah, but remember, it was declining for everybody\u2014the access.\n\nHow do you think about the years since 2000? And more personally, do you feel frustration and regret simply because that the election altered your life and ability to do the work that you\u2019re very passionate about?\n\nWell, it depends on the object of the regret. What I regret is the 5\u20134 decision by Scalia. What I regret is 330,000 Democrats who voted for Bush in Florida. What I regret is, you know, the shenanigans with the ballot design, and the hanging chads, which deceived people. And Secretary of State Katherine Harris deliberately allowing a consulting firm to misidentify thousands of people as ex-felons and take away their vote.\n\nI talked to Gore about 2000. He doesn\u2019t blame the Greens. He said, \u201cLook, we made so many mistakes.\u201d He didn\u2019t get his home state of Tennessee. That alone would have put them in the White House, with everything else remaining the same. He didn\u2019t get Arkansas. That would have put him in. Clinton didn\u2019t help him. One blunder after another\u2014a lot of complacency about how stupid Bush was and that he could never win. They didn\u2019t recognize the winner-take-all Electoral College sufficiently.\n\nHowever, I\u2019m trying to get the Democratic Party to straighten up. And I\u2019m coming out with a book on this, in June. The Democrats are one of the two 800-pound gorillas. And if they\u2019d open their ears and eyes\u2014WinningAmerica.net redux\u2014it can be repeated two years later, with almost no changes. They could handily beat the Republicans and just be autocrats instead of fascists. How about that for a choice?\n\nThat seems like a limited choice.\n\nIt\u2019s a very serious choice. [Laughs.]\n\nThe Democrats are running on the idea of democracy. What do you think of the Democrats\u2019 version of democracy?\n\nBiden\u2019s running on democracy as he knew it pre-Trump. It\u2019s just revert to pre-Trump days when they didn\u2019t purge and suppress votes, blah, blah, blah. If you do not have the pressure coming from organized, informed people\u2014who summon their senators and representatives and state legislatures to town meetings, who have their own choreography, and they set the agenda\u2014and the legislators, listen to them and hear them and respond and exchange and go back to their jobs instructed, you\u2019re always going to have the few decide for the many, in the interests of the few.\n\nI mean, how many times can I repeat this?",

        "text": "U.S. Presidential Election 2024: Journalist safety kit\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\nWhatsApp\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nTelegram\n\n\n\nThe 2024 United States presidential election will take place on Tuesday, November 5 amid an increasingly polarized political climate. In addition to facing a high level of distrust in the media, journalists are likely to confront significant security challenges in the lead-up to the election, as well as on election day.\n\nThe contested 2020 election and the January 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol have contributed to a rise in domestic extremism and an increased presence of politically motivated militia groups, who are likely to appear at political rallies and polling stations in certain U.S. states. As a result, journalists may face forceful reprisals, including physical harassment, obstruction, and verbal abuse. Media workers covering the election should be aware of the increased risk of online abuse, including doxxing, and targeted disinformation campaigns designed to undermine the press. This underscores an increasingly hostile environment for journalists in the U.S., with at least 40 assaults against journalists in 2023, according to the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker, a comprehensive database of U.S. press freedom violations, of which CPJ is a founding member.\n\nThe guide below is designed to help newsrooms and journalists think about and manage physical and digital risk when it comes to covering the U.S. election.\n\nEditors\u2019 Checklist\n\nFor journalists, having a quick conversation with their editor can increase risk awareness and enhance your safety. The following checklist enables editors to best prepare journalists and other media workers as they cover election hotspots or risky assignments.\n\nWhen selecting your reporting team, consider:\n\nHow experienced are the journalists?\n\nHave they covered stories with elevated tension or emotions that can lead to violence?\n\nDo they have a history of good decision-making under pressure?\n\nIf they are less experienced, what support mechanisms can you put in place to increase their safety? For example, could a more senior journalist cover the desk and provide guidance if needed?\n\nIs your team mentally prepared to be confronted by aggressive individuals?\n\nOn higher-risk stories, can you assign two journalists, so no one works alone?\n\nBear in mind that exposing the identity of the journalist may increase their risk of harm, and plan accordingly. In some cases, a journalist\u2019s identity may also help to keep them safe.\n\nDo they have local knowledge about the area they will be working in?\n\nAs part of your risk assessment, discuss:\n\nEstablishing a check-in procedure.\n\nWhat footage or other material will be needed to complete the assignment. There is no point lingering at a risky crowd event gathering material that will not be used.\n\nConducting a dynamic risk assessment and consider using CPJ\u2019s risk assessment template.\n\nThe potential for online attacks as a result of reporting on the election. Review CPJ\u2019s editor\u2019s checklist on protecting staff and freelancers against online abuse.\n\nWhat indicators to look for that would trigger a withdrawal of the team from their reporting location.\n\nRecording the emergency contacts and details of all staff being sent on the assignment.\n\nTo increase awareness when in the field, advise journalists to:\n\nConsult CPJ\u2019s safety guide for journalists on utilizing situational awareness.\n\nMaintain a low profile and gauge the mood of crowds toward the media before entering any situation. Always use discretion when reporting or filming, especially around people who are armed or aggressive.\n\nPlan for regular check-ins with your editor or newsroom point of contact. If working as a freelancer, consider having a check-in procedure with a fellow journalist, family, or friend.\n\nEnsure that your mobile phone is fully charged. Consider taking a power bank with you.\n\nTake the time to plan an exit strategy in case the situation turns violent. Identify where you can take cover if you are able to escape, or until help arrives.\n\nIf you are working alone or after dark, be extra vigilant, as the risk potential increases.\n\nAvoid individuals who are under the influence of drugs or alcohol.\n\nIf possible, try to build a rapport with individuals before interviewing them.\n\nWhen conducting an interview, consider your situation. Are you surrounded by others who may take an interest in your reporting? It is often individuals on the periphery who start causing trouble, rather than interviewees.\n\nWhen you are on the phone or filing copy or footage, ensure that you are in a protected space where you can see threats coming.\n\nIn general, be prepared to be verbally abused, intimidated, or even spat at. Remain calm and do not allow yourself to be provoked.\n\nConsider your choice of clothes. Avoid wearing flammable materials, such as nylon, or anything that is loose-fitting and can be grabbed. Avoid newsroom logos and political slogans, as well as military fatigues and black-colored outfits, which are often worn by far-left anti-fascist (antifa) groups.\n\nIf an incident occurs, take notes on what happened and notify the relevant authorities.\n\nContinuously observe the mood and demeanor of the authorities. Visual cues such as police in riot gear, shield walls, or thrown projectiles are potential indicators that aggression can be expected. Pull back to a safe location when such \u201cred flags\u201d are evident.\n\nIn general, be prepared to leave the situation if you feel the level of risk escalating or that appealing to the authorities would be to no avail.\n\nIf you leave, retreat to a safe location before reporting into your newsroom or point of contact.\n\nPeople gather at the Black Lives Matter Plaza across from the White House in Washington, D.C. on November 8, 2020.

The police failed to uphold basic constitutional rights for journalists, leading to unjust arrests and suppression tactics at big and small protests, according to a 2023 report from the Knight Foundation.\n\nTo minimize risks when covering election rallies and events:\n\nPlan the assignment and know the area where you are going. Work out in advance what you would do in case of an emergency. Take a medical kit if you know how to use it.\n\nEnsure that your phone has a fully charged battery. Consider if you should take a power bank.\n\nWear clothing without media company branding and remove media logos from equipment/vehicles if necessary. Have appropriate clothing and footwear.\n\nAlways try to work with a colleague and have a regular check-in procedure with your base, particularly if covering rallies or crowd events.\n\nWear clothing and footwear that allows you to move swiftly. Avoid loose clothing and lanyards that can be grabbed, as well as any flammable material (i.e., nylon).\n\nConsider your position. If you can, find an elevated vantage point that might offer greater safety.\n\nAt any location, always plan an evacuation route as well as an emergency rendezvous point if you are working with others. Know the closest point of medical assistance.\n\nMaintain situational awareness at all times and limit the number of valuables you take. Do not leave any equipment in vehicles, which are likely to be broken into. After dark, the criminal risk increases.\n\nIf working in a crowd, plan a strategy. It is sensible to keep to the outside of the crowd and don\u2019t get sucked into the middle where it is hard to escape. Identify an escape route and have an emergency meeting point if working with a team.\n\nPhotojournalists generally have to be in the thick of the action, so are at more risk. Photographers should have someone watching their back and should remember to look up from their viewfinder every few seconds. Do not wear the camera strap around your neck to avoid the risk of strangulation. Photojournalists often do not have the luxury of being able to work at a distance, so it is important to minimize the time spent in the crowd. Get your shots and get out.\n\nAll journalists should be conscious of not outstaying their welcome in a crowd, which can turn hostile quickly.\n\nConsider the need for security if the risk is high. A local hired back watcher to protect you/your kit can be attuned to a developing threat while you are concentrating on work.\n\nPolice in the United States have used tear gas, batons, pepper balls and rubber coated bullets to disperse crowds. Consider using personal protective equipment, but if this is not appropriate, pay attention to the police. If firearms are visible, move to hard cover and do not dwell in natural exits in case of a stampede.\n\nTo minimize the risk when dealing with tear gas:\n\nYou should wear personal protective equipment that includes a gas mask, eye protection and respirator.\n\nIndividuals with asthma or respiratory issues should avoid areas where tear gas is being deployed. Likewise, wearing contact lenses is not advisable. If large amounts of tear gas are being used, there is the possibility of high concentrations of gas sitting in areas with no movement of air.\n\nTake note of any potential landmarks (i.e., posts, curbs) that can be used to help you navigate out of the area if you are struggling to see.\n\nIf you are exposed to tear gas, try to find higher ground, and stand in fresh air to allow the breeze to carry the gas away. Do not rub your eyes or face, as this may worsen the situation. Once possible, shower in cold water to wash the gas from skin, but do not bathe. Clothing may need to be washed several times to remove the crystals completely or even discarded.\n\nPhysical Safety: Dealing with aggression\n\nRead people\u2019s body language, and use your own body language, to pacify a situation.\n\nMaintain eye contact with an aggressor, use open hand gestures, and talk in a calming manner.\n\nKeep an extended arm\u2019s length from the threat. If someone grabs you, break away firmly without aggression. If cornered and in danger, shout.\n\nIf the situation escalates, keep a hand free to protect your head and move with short, deliberate steps to avoid falling. If part of a team, stick together and link arms.\n\nBe aware of the situation and your own safety. While there are times when documenting aggression can be newsworthy, taking pictures of aggressive individuals can escalate a situation.\n\nPhysical Safety: Dealing with armed extremists\n\nMilitia groups have made their presence felt within the American political environment in recent years. Most groups oppose government and law enforcement powers, though some view themselves as potential partners to certain law enforcement agencies. A report by ISD Global states that extremist ideologies have constantly evolved over the past two decades and a new younger generation of extremists have emerged. This can be attributed to the use of online platforms being used to reach broader audiences and to push extreme ideologies into the mainstream.\n\nACLED research shows that the Three Percenters, Proud Boys, Patriot Prayer and Boogaloo Bois have a high or very high history of using violence during elections. Since the 2020 election, far-right militias have been involved in 91 percent of violent demonstrations, according to ACLED.\n\nAccording to ACLED, extremist groups adopt hybrid tactics. It is common for groups to train for urban and rural combat with public relations and propaganda works to engage with a wider audience. Groups often place themselves in so-called \u201cpublic protection\u201d roles that increase the threat faced by journalists. Flash points for violence include swing states, state capitals, periphery towns, and rural and suburban areas.\n\nThere have been documented instances of armed extremists and militia members positioning themselves as so-called \u201cdropbox watchers\u201d at polling stations, with the apparent intent of intimidating and bullying both voters and poll workers.\n\nThe following should be considered for reporting from places where armed extremists may be present:\n\nAgree on a plan of action with your editor including indicators to withdraw.\n\nPlan for regular check-ins with your editor or newsroom point of contact. If working as a freelancer, consider having a check-in procedure with a fellow journalist, family, or friend.\n\nAvoid lone working where possible. A colleague can act as a backwatcher allowing you to focus on gathering.\n\nConsider your reporting location. If possible, review the location in-person or on Google Street View to identify any pinch points and avoid getting trapped in your reporting position.\n\nContinuously observe the atmosphere and demeanor of individuals. Pull back to a safe location when \u2018red flags\u2019 e.g., indicators for aggression or thrown projectiles are visible.\n\nHave an escape plan. Ensure that any vehicles are parked with clear exit routes.\n\nConsider if displaying any logos from your news outlet or press ID cards may be contentious and increase personal risk.\n\nFamiliarize yourself with state and federal laws related to firearms possession and paramilitary activity in order to understand the types of conduct that may be unlawful.\n\nRefer to \u2018dealing with aggression\u2019 mitigations above.\n\nRepublican presidential candidate and former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley is seen on a reporter\u2019s phone as she answers a question from the media following a campaign visit in Newberry, South Carolina, on February 10, 2024.

Media workers face an increasingly hostile online environment exacerbated by the spread of disinformation and misinformation. They are often targeted by online attackers who want to discredit them and their work. This can often involve coordinated campaigns that leave the journalist unable to use social media, essentially forcing them offline. Protecting against online harassment is not easy, however, the more you can do to protect yourself in advance of an attack the safer you will be.\n\nEssential steps to protect against doxing Regularly look yourself up online and remove personal information\n\nRemove personal data by signing up to services, such as DeleteMe\n\nSecure accounts with two-factor authentication\n\nSpeak with family and friends about what you are happy to share and not share online\n\nMake a plan for what to do in case you are doxed\n\nTo minimize the risk:\n\nProtect your personal data\n\nSome data is more important to protect than others. Information that can be used to locate you, contact you via a means you do not want, or can be used to confirm your identity, is best kept private where possible. This includes your home address, personal cell phone number, and data, such as your social security number or date of birth. This information is often used by online abusers to threaten journalists and also carry out identity theft.\n\nCheck to see if your address or other personal data, such as your date of birth or telephone number, is available online. You should take steps to remove that information yourself or request for it to be removed, where possible. See CPJ\u2019s guide to removing personal data from the internet for more information.\n\nSign up to have your personal information removed from data broker sites, using services such as DeleteMe, which is owned by the company Abine. Be aware that these services remove data from the most common data broker sites, so your personal information will likely continue to exist on the internet in some form. Consider signing up family members if you consider yourself at high risk of being targeted. Be mindful that it can take up to a month to have your data removed.\n\nReview your online profile for images and information that could be manipulated or used to discredit you. Journalists should take steps to remove any information that they feel could be used against them.\n\nDuring the election period, monitor your social media accounts for increased levels of harassment or abusive commentary.\n\nBe aware that there is often an uptick in online abuse during election periods. This could include targeted smear campaigns against a journalist or their media outlet.\n\nProtect your accounts\n\nProtect your accounts by creating long, unique passwords for each account. Turn on two-factor authentication for all your accounts, and ideally use an app, rather than your phone number, to receive the code. Alternatively secure your accounts using a passkey. See CPJ\u2019s Digital Safety Kit to learn more about account security.\n\nReview the privacy settings on your social media accounts. Read more about what data is best kept private in CPJ\u2019s guide to removing personal data from the internet. Social media accounts can also reveal your location, so disable location tracking if you feel it puts you at risk.\n\nTurn off geo-location for posts on all accounts. If you are going to post photos showing your exact location, consider waiting until after you have left the area.\n\nWhere possible, create professional accounts for social media.\n\nPlan for online abuse\n\nIf you can, speak with your newsroom or editor about any concerns you have about potential online abuse. Check if the outlet has an online abuse policy or support system for journalists who are targeted online. Editors can review CPJ\u2019s pre-assignment checklist for projecting journalists against online abuse.\n\nDifferent stories carry different online risks. Speak with your editor about possible threats and how to mitigate them, including any preventative measures you can take. Ask whether reporters who have previously worked on similar stories have received abuse online. Be aware that you are most at risk of an online attack after publishing a story.\n\nKnow what support the newsroom can offer. For example, can they provide IT support or mental health support?\n\nCarry out a digital security risk assessment. Use CPJ\u2019s template to help you get started.\n\nSpeak with family and friends about the threat of online abuse and about the type of information you do and don\u2019t want posted online. In many cases, journalists can be doxed or targeted with content posted by friends or family members.\n\nManaging online attacks\n\nThere are different types of online attacks and your response to them will likely differ depending on the threat. See the steps below for guidance.\n\nIf personal data, such as your home address or personal cell phone number, are being circulated on the internet this means your safety is at increased risk.\n\nTry not to engage with those who are harassing you online, as this can make the situation worse. If you are targeted by an orchestrated smear campaign, it may be helpful to write a factual statement outlining the situation and pinning it to the top of your social media accounts. Media outlets can also write statements of support as a way to counteract a targeted campaign.\n\nConsider making all of your social media accounts private, and ask family members to do the same.\n\nInform your family, employees, and friends that you are being harassed online. Adversaries will often contact family members and your workplace and send them information or images to damage your reputation.\n\nSpeak with your newsroom to see what support is available to you. If you are a freelancer, or your newsroom does not have a policy in place, you can find resources at the Coalition Against Online Violence\u2019s Online Harassment Resource Hub.\n\nBe vigilant for any hacking attempts on your accounts and ensure that you have taken steps to update your privacy settings, set up two-factor authentication, and create long, unique passwords for each account.\n\nReview your social media accounts for comments that may indicate that an online threat may escalate into a physical attack. This could include people posting your address online and calling on others to attack you or increased harassment from a particular individual. Ask a trusted person to help you review your mentions or monitor your account to protect your mental health or if you are unable to monitor it yourself.\n\nDocument any abuse that you feel is threatening. Take screenshots of the comments, including the social media handle of the person who is threatening you. This information may be useful if there is a police inquiry.\n\nYou may want to block or mute those who are harassing you online. You should also report any abusive content to social media companies or email providers and keep a record of your contact with these companies.\n\nYou may want to consider going offline for a period of time until the harassment has died down.\n\nFor more information and suggestions for keeping yourself safe online, consult CPJ\u2019s Resources for protecting against online abuse.\n\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists is a member of the Coalition Against Online Violence, a collection of global organizations working to find better solutions for women journalists facing online abuse, harassment and other forms of digital attack.\n\nJournalists photograph a demonstrator protesting outside of the Criminal Courts Building as the grand jury continues to hear evidence against former President Donald Trump on March 22, 2023 in New York City.

If you are detained while covering the election, your devices may be taken and searched, which could have serious consequences for both you and your sources. The police raid on the Kansas newspaper, The Marion County Record, last year, as reported by CPJ, highlights the importance for newsrooms around the secure storage of their data.\n\nThe following steps can help:\n\nDigital Safety: General best practices for election rallies and events\n\nLock laptops and phones with a PIN or password. This will better protect the content on your devices if they are taken from you.\n\nBe aware that the authorities may be able to access your phone even if it is secured with a code. Using biometrics can be helpful if you need quick access to your phone, but journalists should be mindful that it can also give others, such as the authorities, easier access to your device. Know your rights with respect to what the authorities can and cannot do with your devices and the content stored on them.\n\nUpdate your operating system when prompted to help protect devices against the latest malware, including spyware.\n\nTurn on encryption for your devices if it is not already enabled by default.\n\nDo not leave devices unattended in public, including when charging, to avoid them being stolen or tampered with.\n\nAvoid using USB sticks that may be handed out at election events. These could contain malware that could infect your devices.\n\nBe aware that any phone conversation or SMS message sent via a cell phone provider can be intercepted, and the content obtained. To avoid this, use end-to-end encrypted messaging services, such as WhatsApp or Signal. Learn more about how to use these apps securely in CPJ\u2019s guide to encrypted communications.\n\nBe aware that contacts on your phone may be stored in more than one location, including in phone apps and in a cloud account linked to the phone, such as Google Drive or iCloud. Take time to review your contacts and remove anyone who could be at risk if your devices are taken and searched.\n\nWhen reporting at the event, have a process for safeguarding material that you have already collected. That way, if you are detained, the authorities will only have access to your most recent content, not all of your materials. For more information, review CPJ\u2019s guidance for journalists on the risk of arrest and detention.\n\nWrite down on paper or your arm the contact details of key people, such as your editor or a trusted colleague, in case you are detained and your devices are taken. You may also consider writing down the number of a legal contact. The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press (RCFP) has a legal hotline for journalists reporting in the United States.\n\nConsider setting up your devices to wipe remotely. This will delete all content on your phone or laptop once activated, but only if it is connected to either WiFi or mobile data. You will need to set up remote wipe in advance, and you should give a trusted person access to the password so they can erase your content in case you are detained.\n\nBe aware that live streaming from an event gives away your location.\n\nIdeally, journalists should avoid carrying their personal phones to cover an election rally or protest. If you work for a news outlet with a budget to cover a work phone, you should request one.\n\nJournalists who are carrying their personal phones should take the following precautions to protect their data: Review what information is stored on your devices, including phones and computers. Anything that puts you at risk or contains sensitive information should be backed up and deleted. You can back up your device by connecting your phone to your computer using a USB cable or in the cloud. Journalists should be aware that there are ways to recover deleted information if your devices are taken and inspected. When reviewing content on your phone, journalists should check information stored in apps and in the cloud. Think about what apps you may need on your device while covering a rally or protest. Apps for email services and social media providers contain a lot of personal information about you that the authorities or others could access if they take your phone. Think about temporarily uninstalling apps you will not need. You can install them again once you have finished covering the event.\n\nDigital Safety: General best practice for protecting data in the newsroom\n\nThis guidance is for small- to medium-sized news outlets that may not have a dedicated IT department.\n\nCarry out a review of what data the newsroom has and where it is stored both physically and digitally. This could include data being stored on devices in the office, on work devices at homes of journalists, on work and personal phones and in cloud accounts and external drives.\n\nKnow what data is essential to protect and understand what the threat could be. For example, it could be a legal subpoena, a hacking attempt, or unauthorized access being given to documents. Understanding the threat will help you decide what steps you need to take to protect the information.\n\nUnderstand the terms and services of the online services you use. Research how the company stores your data, how long they store it for, whether there have been any data breaches, and whether they have complied with legal requests for data. This will help you decide whether the newsroom should use their service or whether using it puts your data and sources at risk.\n\nSecure your accounts by ensuring that two-factor authentication (2FA) is turned on. Use an app, such as Authy, to receive the code and ensure that you have a copy of the backup codes for each account where 2FA is turned on. Use a password manager to generate long passwords of a minimum of 15 characters. Each account should have a different password. If you are at high risk of phishing, consider using the passkey option to secure your accounts. Encourage staff and freelancers to do the same for their personal accounts, including social media. This will help better protect accounts from hacking attempts. Read more about account security in CPJ\u2019s digital safety kit.\n\nTake steps to encrypt your data:\n\nTurn on encryption for laptops and desktops. Use Bitlocker for Windows Pro and FireVault for Mac. You can use these programs to also encrypt external hard drives. Encrypt your cloud backup using Cryptomator. You can also use Cryptomator to encrypt individual documents or folders. Ensure that phones are encrypted. Android users should turn on encryption in the settings section of their device. iPhones come with encryption as standard but journalists should ensure that their cloud backup is encrypted by turning on the advanced data protection option on their devices.\n\n\n\nSecure all desktops, laptops and phones with a password or PIN. Be aware that law enforcement may request that you unlock them. Know your rights with regards to unlocking any devices.\n\nReduce unwanted access to documents stored in the cloud by limiting access to a need to know basis and securing documents and folders with a password or PIN.\n\nCreate a data retention policy for the newsroom detailing where data should be stored, how often data should be backed up, and how long it should be stored for.\n\nHave an onboarding and onboarding document that stipulates how and when access is given to accounts and ensures that access is revoked for people no longer working at the outlet.\n\nKnow your rights should data be confiscated by the authorities.\n\nFor additional assistance, to speak directly with CPJ\u2019s Emergencies team, or enquire about safety training for you or your news organization, please email us at [email protected].

Chip Babcock, a Houston-based attorney representing the news outlet, confirmed the case had been resolved but said he was unable to disclose any of the settlement terms.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nSmartmatic was an odd target for the conspiracy theorists because use of its voting technology and software was so limited. It was used only in Los Angeles County, a Democratic stronghold in a state that was not a presidential battleground and where Trump did not contest his loss.\n\nBut the company has for years also provided voting services in Venezuela, and that created a springboard for phony claims that a foreign company was involved in a vast conspiracy to flip the election from Trump to Democrat Joe Biden. Smartmatic also has active lawsuits against Fox News and the conservative outlet Newsmax over similar complaints. Fox has said it had a First Amendment right to air claims about an election that were being promoted by prominent figures.\n\nLast year, on the eve of a trial, Fox News agreed to pay $787 million to settle a defamation lawsuit filed by a much larger voting technology company, Dominion Voting Systems, which claimed the network and its hosts spread false claims that its equipment helped rig the election against Trump. Dominion has other defamation lawsuits that remain active, including one against One America News Network.\n\nThe conspiracy theories relating to voting equipment and software are among the lies about the outcome of the 2020 presidential election won by Biden. Numerous reviews, audits and recounts in the presidential swing states where Trump contested his loss have affirmed Biden's victory, and there has been no evidence of widespread fraud. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, is facing federal and state charges related to his attempts to overturn the results.",

        "text": "PITCH: Legal Analysis of Hush Money Trial facing former President Donald Trump\nMedia Tip Sheets\n\nLegal Analysis of the Trump Hush Money Case\n\nBy Gregory Germain, Professor of Law\n\nTo request an interview with Professor Germain, please contact Ellen James Mbuqe, executive director of media relations, at ejmbuqe@syr.edu.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s criminal trial in New York begins today with jury selection. The following is a summary and legal analysis of this very complicated case.\n\nDistrict Attorney Alvin Bragg alleges that, shortly before the 2016 presidential election between Donald Trump and Hilary Clinton, Trump made several arrangements to prevent the public disclosure of allegations against him that might negatively affect his election.\n\nFirst, Trump arranged with American Media, Inc., the publisher of the National Enquirer, to \u201ccatch and kill\u201d stories that might be embarrassing to Trump. The National Enquirer paid for and killed two potential stories: one from a doorman who alleged that Trump had fathered a child out of wedlock, which proved to be untrue, and a second from a former Playboy model Karen McDougal, who claimed to have had an affair with Trump during his marriage.\n\nSecond, and more importantly, for the actual charges in the indictment, Trump arranged with his then-lawyer and now chief nemesis, Michael Cohen, to pay $130,000 in \u201chush money\u201d to Stephanie Clifford, known professionally as Stormy Daniels, who is described by Wikipedia as \u201can American pornographic film actress, director and former stripper,\u201d to prevent her from disclosing a sexual relationship with Trump.\n\nTrump disguised the hush money payments by having Cohen make the payments, and then reimbursing him using business entries that called the payments \u201cattorney fees\u201d.\n\nTrump has never been charged with a crime for making the hush money payments or arranging with AMI to catch and kill stories. The underlying charges were investigated by the US Attorney General\u2019s office, and they decided not to bring criminal charges against Trump.\n\nThere has been some suggestion that the hush money payments might somehow violate federal election laws, although I have never understood how using one\u2019s own money to pay for the non-disclosure of embarrassing allegations would violate the election laws, which are primarily concerned with the solicitation and use of campaign contributions by third parties. Even if the government wanted to charge Trump now for violating the election law in 2016, those charges would likely be barred by the applicable statute of limitations.\n\nThe underlying case is somewhat like the criminal charges brought against former presidential candidate John Edwards, who was charged in 2011 with receiving more than $900,000 in illegal campaign contributions from friends in 2007-08 to make hush money payments to disguise his extramarital relationship and child from becoming public. The Edwards case involved money from third parties, so the election law connection makes some sense. Nevertheless, the jury found Edwards not guilty of violating the campaign finance laws, and the government decided not to further pursue the remaining charges that the jury was unable to decide. Ironically, Jack Smith, the current special prosecutor in the federal classified documents and election interference cases, had directed the Edwards prosecution.\n\nInstead of charging Trump with an underlying crime, District Attorney Bragg is charging Trump only with covering up an underlying crime.\n\nNY penal law 175.05 makes it a \u201cclass A misdemeanor\u201d to falsify business records with \u201cintent to defraud.\u201d Falsifying business records to commit a fraud becomes a Class E felony \u201cwhen his intent to defraud includes an intent to commit another crime or to aid or conceal the commission thereof.\u201d NY Penal Law \u00a7 175.10.\n\nDistrict Attorney Bragg\u2019s indictment charges Trump with 34 felony counts, each of which relates to a business record disguising a payment made to Cohen as attorney fees. The indictment alleges that Trump disguised the payments with intent to cover up another crime. But the indictment does not say what that other crime is.\n\nThere are several layers that I believe District Attorney Bragg must show to convict Trump of committing a felony under Penal Law \u00a7 175.10.\n\nFirst, Bragg must show that Trump made the false business records with intent to commit \u201cfraud,\u201d otherwise Trump would not be guilty of a crime at all, because falsifying business records for non-fraudulent purposes is not a crime under the statute.\n\nIt is not clear who Bragg believes Trump intended to defraud by falsifying these entries. Presumably, Trump was trying to hide the allegations and/or the relationships from his family and/or the public to prevent the disclosure of embarrassing allegations or facts, but traditional \u201cfraud\u201d requires, among other things, showing an intent to receive financial benefits by misleading a victim, and the misrepresentations must cause an actual victim to suffer damages. Fortunately for politicians, not all lies, misrepresentations, or nondisclosures constitute \u201cfraud.\u201d\n\nThe District Attorney has made public statements suggesting that Trump may have been hiding the payments as attorney fees to commit tax fraud, but neither that nor any other specifics regarding an intent to commit fraud is stated in the indictment.\n\nSecond, the District Attorney must show that the reason for Trump\u2019s false entries was to commit or cover up a separate crime, presumably separate from the fraud. If the separate crime is the election law violation, Trump would have had to know that the payment was an election law violation, and to have falsified the records to cover it up that crime. It seems to me that the election law violation would be stronger, not weaker, by making it look like Cohen was the one making the payments for Trump. Disguising the payments through Cohen made it look more like an election law violation by a supporter, not less. Or was Trump trying to disguise the payments to prevent his family or the public from knowing about the embarrassing allegations, rather than covering up an independent crime?\n\nI believe the District Attorney must show (1) that the payments were disguised as attorney fees to commit a fraud on someone, (2) that the underlying payments constituted an independent crime, (3) that Trump knew that the underlying payments constituted a crime, and (4) that the reason he covered up the payments was to disguise that crime. Those are going to be hard things to prove.\n\nJudge Merchan\u2019s summary of the case for the jury glosses over all of these difficult statutory questions. After being unable to get the parties to agree on the language of a statement to be read to the jurors to describe what the case is about, Judge Merchan decided to read the following statement to the jurors to summarize the case:\n\n\u201cThe allegations reflect in substance, that Donald Trump falsified business records to conceal an agreement with others to unlawfully influence the 2016 presidential election. Specifically, it is alleged that Donald Trump made or caused false business records to hide the true nature of payments made to Michael Cohen, by characterizing them as payment for legal services rendered pursuant to a retainer agreement. The People allege that in fact, the payments were intended to reimburse Michael Cohen for money he paid to Stephanie Clifford, also known as Stormy Daniels, in the weeks before the presidential election to prevent her from publicly revealing details about a past sexual encounter with Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nJudge Juan Merchan\u2019s statement fails to explain when it is a crime to \u201cunlawfully influence\u201d an election? Obviously, all politicians attempt to influence voters to vote for them. Politicians regularly misstate facts and fail to disclose facts during their campaign. The law has never allowed members of the public or the government to bring claims for fraud against politicians who make misleading or even downright false statements; indeed our laws broadly protect campaign speech under the First Amendment.\n\nNeither the Court nor the District Attorney has made it clear who was defrauded, what the independent crime is, or when an attempt to influence voters becomes \u201cunlawful\u201d and constitutes an independent crime.\n\nThere is also a question regarding the statute of limitations applicable to these claims. The statute of limitations on a misdemeanor in New York is 2 years, and would have expired long ago. NY Crim Proc 30.10(2)(c). The statute of limitations on \u201cother felonies\u201d is 5 years. NY Crim Proc. \u00a7 30.10(2)(b). The acts occurred in 2016 and 2017, and the District Attorney delayed filing the charges for several years. The District Attorney has argued that the statutes of limitations were tolled during COVID, or that they were extended when Trump left the state. These issues need to be addressed by the court clearly.\n\nSo while there is very strong evidence that Trump created false business record entries to cover up his hush money payments to Stormy Daniels, the District Attorney needs to show multiple difficult elements to establish that the entries were made to commit \u201cfraud,\u201d and for the purpose of covering up a separate crime.\n\nFinally, what is the penalty if Trump is convicted of this Class E felony? He would be subject to a fine of up to $5,000 under NY Pen \u00a7 80.1. If he received some financial benefit, he might have to disgorge three times the amount of the benefit. It is difficult to see how these minor penalties would justify such an expensive investigation and prosecution.\n\nSo the goal must be to impose imprisonment. For a first time offender, the court could impose a prison term of up to one year under NY Penal law \u00a7 70(4), but it would be very unusual to impose prison time for a first time Class E felony, especially where no victim suffered financial harm.\n\nThis case is an important test for our legal system. District Attorney Alvin Bragg was under intense political pressure to bring these charges, even after his predecessor, Cyrus Vance Jr., decided not to do so. Trump is very unpopular in Manhattan, and has acted boorishly and foolishly in verbally attacking parties, judges, court clerks and their families. But the law must be applied fairly and evenly to all parties, even those who are locally unpopular, and it is the District Attorney\u2019s responsibility to assure equal treatment under the law.\n\nI believe that the use of our legal system for political purposes will backfire with the electorate. Every time a politically motivated case is decided, the polls show Trump becoming more popular. Alvin Bragg sits in the chair once occupied by one of my legal heroes, Robert Morgenthau, who refused to use his office for political purposes, and had the courage to admit when his office made mistakes. Bragg has a lot to live up to. This old case, with all of its legal difficulties, should not have been brought",

        "text": "US election: its impact on healthcare\nUS election: its impact on healthcare\n\nTue, 16th Apr 2024\n\nHealthcare will once again become high profile in the run-up to US presidential elections in November, when EIU expects current president Joe Biden to compete against the former Republican president Donald Trump.\n\nThe biggest debate will be over the future of the 2010 Affordable Care Act (ACA), more popularly known as Obamacare. Mr Trump has once again promised to repeal and replace the legislation.\n\nBoth candidates will also promise to bring down medical and pharmaceutical inflation, with Mr Biden pushing through federal price negotiations and Mr Trump relying on greater transparency.\n\nThe bitter debate over abortion will divide along party lines, with Mr Biden vowing to protect abortion rights. Both candidates, however, will be forced to leave decisions to individual states and courts.\n\nUntil late 2023, healthcare had not been a major talking point for either frontrunner for this year\u2019s US presidential election. That changed during the US midterm elections, which showed that the politics of healthcare will continue to be an election issue. The debate is likely to focus on three highly contentious areas. The biggest is the future of the 2010 ACA, which Mr Biden has pledged to reinforce and Mr Trump has again promised to repeal and replace. Related to this are efforts to reduce the pace of medical inflation, particularly for pharmaceuticals. The final bone of contention is abortion, after the US Supreme Court in June 2022 overturned the precedent set in the 1973 landmark case, Roe v Wade, which gave federal abortion rights to all women in the country.\n\nOn all three fronts, the dividing lines are clear, based on the guiding principles of the two likely candidates. In the event of a victory for Mr Biden (EIU\u2019s core forecast), healthcare policy would still be aimed at risk-pooling and redistribution initiatives for expanding access to healthcare, supported by increasing centralisation of the system. For Mr Trump, the priority would be choice and transparency, with many decisions left to individual states, courts and providers.\n\nIf Joe Biden is reelected\n\nThe ACA \u2013 During his current term of office, Mr Biden has worked hard to repair the damage done to Obamacare during Mr Trump\u2019s presidency in 2017-21. One key Trump victory, in 2019, was to remove the tax penalty that used to be imposed on individuals who failed to buy insurance under the individual mandate. Even so, the 2024 enrollment period saw more than 21m Americans sign up for health insurance coverage through ACA marketplaces\u2014the highest-ever total. Having raised and expanded federal subsidies for ACA policy-holders in the 2025 budget, Mr Biden\u2019s government is now pushing Congress to make those subsidies more permanent. These policies are likely to be more central to the Biden campaign as the elections near.\n\nMedical inflation \u2013 If re-elected, we expect Mr Biden to continue implementing his plans to reduce or contain healthcare costs, including efforts to regulate the pharmaceutical industry. A new Biden administration would continue to push through measures introduced under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2021 that allow Medicare, a federal health fund primarily for the elderly, to negotiate prices for drugs. The first negotiations began in August 2023, with ten drugs selected for conditions such as for heart failure, blood clots, diabetes and arthritis. The resulting prices will come into effect in 2026, with negotiations set to cover 60 medicines over the next four years. Such policies\u2014which include an IRA cap on insulin prices that has already been implemented\u2014are likely to play well in the run-up to the election.\n\nIn December 2023 the Biden-Harris administration also announced new plans to boost competition in the pharmaceutical sector, while ensuring lower prescription drug costs. The proposed framework will include provisions for march-in rights on taxpayer-funded drugs and other inventions (where the accessibility of a drug will be factored in while making pricing decisions). The current administration has also tried to control consolidation in the health insurance and hospital sectors, including banning several planned mergers and reviewing smaller acquisitions by private-equity firms.\n\nAbortion \u2013 A new Biden administration would strive to restore nationwide access to abortion and provide broader reproductive rights. Mr Biden has promised to enforce existing legislation that supports abortion rights, including pursuing cases against individual states. However, even if the Democrats win control of both the House and Senate (not our core forecast), reinstating a federal constitutional right to abortion is going to be extremely difficult unless the conservative majority at the Supreme Court is altered.\n\nIf Donald Trump is elected\n\nThe ACA \u2013 Mr Trump has once again vowed to repeal and replace the ACA within the first 100 days in office, if he is re-elected. In his previous term as president, however, he oversaw a long series of failed efforts to overturn the legislation and replace it with the Republicans\u2019 own version, the American Health Care Act. Mr Trump did manage to weaken Obamacare by removing the tax penalties under the individual mandate, by introducing limited low-cost policies and by leaving some decisions on coverage and subsidies to the state level. Although we would not expect a full repeal of Obamacare, therefore, we would expect a Trump administration to cut subsidies for ACA policy-holders and to reduce federal funding to Medicaid, a public health insurance programme for low-income individuals.\n\nMedical inflation \u2013 A Trump administration is likely to cancel or delay the price negotiations at Medicare that were introduced under the IRA, which are unpopular with many pharmaceutical companies. Instead the administration will try to introduce industry-wide legislation on pricing transparency, similar to the No Surprises Act that came into effect in January 2022 to protect patients against unexpected medical bills. Mr Trump will also push ahead with efforts to introduce international pricing comparisons for medicines, as he did in 2020. Such measures are likely to be introduced via executive orders, rather than legislation.\n\nAbortion \u2013 While Mr Trump\u2019s stance on abortion rights in the 2024 campaign has so far been unclear, his role in undermining abortion rights cannot be forgotten. It was his appointment of three conservative justices to the Supreme Court that led to its decision to strike down Roe v. Wade. Following that decision, 21 states now either have a complete ban on abortion or stringent limitations to prohibit the procedure earlier than the standard set by the 1973 judgement. Mr Trump\u2019s previous administration also introduced curbs on federal funding for abortion clinics in the US (which have since been overturned under Mr Biden). During a second Trump term, we would expect further crackdowns on abortion and reproductive rights, although most of the decisions will be left to individual states and courts.\n\nDespite these policy differences, we would expect US healthcare spending to continue rising strongly under both a Biden and a Trump administration. Even though both candidates are focused on bringing down medical inflation, total spending will be driven upwards by patient demand, population ageing and the cost of medical innovation.\n\nOur current forecast, based on a Biden win, is for total healthcare expenditure to reach 16.9% of US GDP by 2028, higher than before the pandemic. This implies spending growth of around 5% a year, with public spending outpacing private. Although Mr Trump will move to reduce federal subsidies and funding for several health programmes, including Obamacare policies, some of his proposed reforms will also require one-off bumps in public health expenditure. However, in the event of a Trump victory, we would review our longer-term forecast for public and private health expenditure, with growth in the former likely to slow.\n\nThe analysis and forecasts featured in this article can be found in EIU\u2019s Country Analysis service.

        "text": "What I Saw at the U.S.-Mexico Border\nA delegation of Jewish clergy, led by HIAS and T'ruah, prepares to cross from Mexico into the United States in February 2024. (Justin Hamel for HIAS)\n\n*The following is adapted from an email that Rabbi Lewis Kamrass sent to HIAS supporters on April 15.\n\nI recently had the opportunity to travel from my home in Cincinnati to the U.S.-Mexico border, which I visited as part of a delegation of rabbis and Jewish clergy with HIAS and T\u2019ruah: The Rabbinic Call for Human Rights. We were there as faith leaders to witness a humanitarian emergency, learn from experts on the ground, and bring the experience back to our communities.\n\nMy experience was powerful and eye-opening. The disconnect between the polarizing rhetoric in the national conversation and what I witnessed firsthand was palpable.\n\nOne thing was clear from the moment I arrived. This is a crisis that requires a moral voice. It is so much more than just a policy challenge or a political debate. It presents a basic moral question of how our country treats people in a moment of need \u2014 whether we offer refuge to people fleeing danger, whether we blame the victims of violence, and whether we help them.\n\nAs the national discourse about the border reaches a fever pitch, politicians are using anti-immigrant rhetoric to score political points rather than addressing the actual human needs. The people I met there are far from the criminals they\u2019re so often made out to be. At a detention center, we saw how arbitrary, expensive, and unnecessary it is for our country to detain people while awaiting their asylum hearings. The people we met have done nothing wrong, yet they are jailed. Many of them are being rapidly deported back to their home countries or Mexico before ever getting due process of asylum hearings.\n\nOn a visit to two shelters on the Mexican side of the border, we spoke with several women about the extreme danger they fled in their home countries and the hardships they experienced on their journey, including sexual violence, smuggling, and long waits for an asylum appointment. What struck me most was that through everything, they still spoke of their faith, telling us that \u201call I have is God.\u201d\n\nTheir steadfast faith helped carry them through unimaginable hardship. Witnessing that kind of faith is humbling. It awakened a moral clarity within me about what my tradition demands \u2014 an unshakeable commitment to universal human dignity. Making that affirmation is simple, but upholding it as a society requires moral conviction, principled leadership, and political will.\n\nWe cannot turn away. We can \u2014 and must \u2014 faithfully come together to shape a world in which all refugees find welcome, safety, and opportunity.\n\nEach day, I remain grateful that the Jewish community has an organization like HIAS providing vital services to refugees and asylum seekers and advocates for their fundamental rights so they can rebuild their lives.",

        "text": "Opinion | Why Biden Has a Narrower Path to the Presidency Than Trump, in 11 Maps\nOpinion Guest Essay Why Biden Has a Narrower Path to the Presidency Than Trump, in 11 Maps\n\nIllustration by Akshita Chandra/The New York Times; Images by PhotoObjects.net, Yuji Sakai, and THEPALMER/Getty Images\n\nWhile polls show the race for president is tightening, Joe Biden still has a narrower and more challenging path to winning the election than Donald Trump. The reason is the Electoral College: My analysis of voter history and polling shows a map that currently favors Mr. Trump, even though recent developments in Arizona improve Mr. Biden\u2019s chances. The Biden campaign will need to decide this summer which states to contest hardest. Our Electoral College maps below lay out the best scenarios for him and Mr. Trump.\n\nSeven states with close results determined who won both the 2020 and the 2016 presidential elections, and those same seven states will most likely play the same battleground role this fall: three industrial states \u2013 Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2013 and four Sun Belt states \u2013 Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina.\n\nThe seven states that will most likely decide the 2024 presidential election Wis. Mich. Pa. Nev. N.C. Ariz. Ga. Wis. Mich. Pa. Nev. N.C. Ariz. Ga.\n\nMr. Biden\u2019s declining popularity in the Sun Belt states is the main reason Mr. Trump has an edge right now. He is especially struggling with young and nonwhite voters there. Let\u2019s take a closer look:\n\nAccording to 2020 exit polls, Mr. Biden won 65 percent of Latino voters, who comprised roughly a fifth of voters in Arizona and Nevada. And Mr. Biden won 87 percent of Black voters, who made up 29 percent of the Georgia vote and 23 percent of the North Carolina vote. He also won 60 percent of voters aged 18 to 29. Now look at this year: A New York Times/Siena College poll released last weekend showed support for Mr. Biden had dropped 18 points with Black voters, 15 points with Latinos and 14 points with younger voters nationally.\n\nAbortion could be a decisive issue in Mr. Biden stemming this erosion of support in Arizona and Nevada. The Arizona Supreme Court\u2019s ruling last week that largely bans abortions raises the stakes of a likely ballot initiative on the issue there in November. It also appears likely that there will be a similar ballot measure in Nevada.\n\nNevertheless, the key to Mr. Biden\u2019s victory is to perform well in the three industrial states. If Mr. Trump is able to win one or more of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, Mr. Biden\u2019s path to 270 electoral votes becomes even narrower.\n\nIf Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump remain ahead in the states where they are currently running strongest, the outcome of the election could come down to who wins Michigan and the two Sun Belt states where abortion will very likely be on the ballot, Arizona and Nevada.\n\nBased on past voting, Mr. Trump will start out the general election with 219 electoral votes, compared to 226 votes for Mr. Biden, with 93 votes up for grabs. Voter history and recent polling suggest that Mr. Trump is in a strong position to win North Carolina. Republicans have carried the state in every presidential election since 1976 except in 2008. In a Wall Street Journal battleground poll taken in March, Mr. Biden had only 37 percent job approval in the state.\n\n\n\nBy winning North Carolina, Mr. Trump would have 235 electoral votes and two strong paths to 270. The first path involves carrying Georgia, a state he lost by fewer than 12,000 votes in 2020. Before then, Republicans won Georgia in every election since 1992. If Mr. Trump carries North Carolina and Georgia, he would have a base of 251 electoral votes with four scenarios that get him to 270. Scenario 1 Then all Mr. Trump needs is Pennsylvania \u2026 Then all Mr. Trump needs is Scenario 2 \u2026 or Michigan and Nevada \u2026 \u2026 orand Scenario 3 \u2026 or Michigan and Arizona \u2026 \u2026 orand Scenario 4 \u2026 or Arizona and Wisconsin. \u2026 orand The second and harder path for Mr. Trump would be if he carried only one Southern swing state \u2013 most likely North Carolina. He would have only 235 electoral votes and would need to win three of the six remaining battleground states. Scenario 5 Then he would need to win Arizona, Michigan and Wisconsin \u2026 Then he would need to winand Scenario 6 \u2026 or Arizona, Nevada and Pennsylvania. \u2026 orand\n\nHow Biden Can Win\n\nIt is difficult to see how Mr. Biden gets re-elected without doing well in the industrial battleground states \u2013 the so-called \u201cBlue Wall\u201d for Democrats. This is particularly true of Pennsylvania, given the state\u2019s 19 electoral votes and Mr. Biden\u2019s ties there and appeal to middle-class and blue-collar voters. That\u2019s why he\u2019s spending three days in Pennsylvania this week.\n\nMr. Biden will most likely need to win at least one other industrial battleground \u2013 with Wisconsin the most probable, since his polling numbers there are stronger than in the other battleground states.\n\nA combination of factors have made winning Michigan much more challenging for Mr. Biden. Hamas\u2019s attack on Israel and the war in Gaza have ripped apart the coalitions that enabled Democrats to do so well in the state since 2018. There are over 300,000 Arab Americans there, as well as a large Jewish population. Both groups were crucial to Mr. Biden\u2019s success there in 2020.\n\nIn addition, Michigan voters\u2019 perception of the economy is more negative compared with the other battleground states. In the Journal battleground poll, two-thirds of Michigan voters described the national economy negatively; more than half had a negative opinion of the state\u2019s economy.\n\nNow let\u2019s look at Mr. Biden\u2019s map. Mr. Biden\u2019s best strategy is based on winning Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, which would give him 255 electoral votes (assuming that he carries the 2nd Congressional District in Nebraska).\n\n\n\nBy carrying these states, Mr. Biden has several paths to 270, but the first three scenarios are his most viable. Scenario 1 He just needs to win Michigan \u2026 He just needs to win Scenario 2 \u2026 or Arizona and Nevada \u2026 \u2026 orand Scenario 3 ... or Georgia. ... or There are two other scenarios where Mr. Biden loses Wisconsin and keeps Pennsylvania. But that would mean winning states where Mr. Biden is polling much worse. Scenario 4 They involve Mr. Biden winning Georgia and Arizona \u2026 They involve Mr. Biden winningand Scenario 5 \u2026 or Michigan and Georgia. \u2026 orand\n\nA Look Ahead\n\nWith over six months to go until Election Day, given the volatility in the world and the weaknesses of Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump, it would be foolish to make firm predictions about specific results. And other electoral map scenarios are possible: Recent polling shows Mr. Biden with a narrow lead in Minnesota, a state that usually votes for Democrats for president. While it is mathematically possible for Mr. Biden to win without carrying Minnesota, it is unlikely he will be elected if he cannot carry this traditionally Democratic state.\n\nFor the third election cycle in a row, a small number of voters in a handful of states could determine the next president of the United States.\n\nIf the election remains close but Mr. Biden is unable to regain support from the core group of voters who propelled him to victory in 2020 \u2014 young and nonwhite voters \u2014 then we could be headed to a repeat of the 2016 election. The outcome of that election was decided by fewer than 80,000 votes in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nLast week\u2019s abortion ruling in Arizona, and the likely abortion ballot initiatives in that state and Nevada, give Mr. Biden the possibility of being re-elected even if he loses Michigan. That\u2019s why, if we have another close presidential election, I think Arizona, Michigan and Nevada will likely determine the outcome for Mr. Biden or Mr. Trump.\n\nBased on my experience as Bill Clinton\u2019s White House political director in his 1996 re-election campaign, I would take immediate advantage of Mr. Biden\u2019s significant fund-raising advantage over Mr. Trump to focus on shoring up the president\u2019s chances in Michigan and the must-win states of Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, while at the same time trying to keep Georgia and North Carolina in play. Mr. Biden does not need to win either of those Sun Belt states to get re-elected, but draining Mr. Trump\u2019s resources there could help him in other battleground states.\n\nDoug Sosnik was a senior adviser to President Bill Clinton from 1994 to 2000 and has advised over 50 governors and U.S. senators.",

Trump has pleaded not guilty to all charges .",
        "text": "Even if convicted, why Trump could again become US president\nDonald Trump became the first former US president to face a criminal trial on Monday, when he appeared in a New York court on charges that he illegally covered up a hush-money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels. How will a conviction \u2014 if there is one at all \u2014 impact his bid to become president once again?\n\nFirst, what is this case about?\n\nThe Republican presidential candidate\u2019s trial relates to an alleged $130,000 payment made to Daniels in October 2016, during the final weeks of his first presidential campaign. His then lawyer, Michael Cohen, paid the adult film star off in exchange for her silence about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump.\n\nIn 2018, after initially denying any knowledge of the payment, Trump admitted to reimbursing Cohen for what he called \u201ca simple private transaction\u201d. The same year, however, Cohen pleaded guilty to a host of charges, and testified that Trump and his company had falsely classified the purpose of the Daniels-payment by labelling it as a legal expense.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis led prosecutors to conclude that the money given to Daniels was \u201can improper donation\u201d to the Trump campaign. While making a false entry in company records is a misdemeanour as per New York State law, falsifying records to conceal another crime \u2014 in this case violation of election law, to silence a potential sex scandal \u2014 is a felony.\n\nIf convicted, what punishment is Trump looking at?\n\nThe prosecution has charged Trump with 34 counts of felony for falsifying business records. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges.\n\nAccording to New York law, the maximum sentence for each charge is four years imprisonment. First-time offenders (like Trump), however, are treated more lightly, and it is rare for people with no criminal history to be sent to prison solely for the falsification of records.\n\nAlso in Explained | Why Trump has refused to endorse a national abortion ban in US\n\nA fine, probation, or more seriously, home confinement, are all more likely punishments, especially given that as a former president with a lifetime Secret Service detail, the logistics of keeping Trump safe behind bars will be extremely tricky. Moreover, if he is convicted and imprisoned, Trump is likely to still be released on bail during the appeal.\n\nBut can Trump still be president if convicted?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is no legal provision barring Trump from becoming President even if he is convicted. The United States Constitution sets very few eligibility criteria \u2014 the President must be at least 35 years old, and a \u201cnatural born\u201d citizen to have lived in the US for at least 14 years. In fact, in theory, Trump could even be sworn in from prison or home confinement if he were to win the election after being convicted and sentenced.\n\nWhile states could try to keep Trump off the ballot by passing legislation requiring a clean criminal record, such legislation is unlikely to stand in courts. \u201cI think the best reading of our Constitution is [that] you don\u2019t let the state add new substantive requirements [to stand for elections],\u201d Prof Jessica Levinson, an election law expert from Loyola Law School, told The NYT.\n\nMoreover, Trump has long leveraged the criminal cases against him to his advantage by saying he is a part of a larger conspiracy. According to his campaign findings, he saw a surge in donations every time he was indicted.\n\nNonetheless, a conviction is a very different matter. A Reuters/Ipsos poll this month found a firm majority of voters viewed the New York criminal charges against Trump as serious, with a quarter of Republican respondents saying that they would not vote for Trump if he were convicted of a felony crime by a jury.\n\n(With inputs from Reuters)",

        "text": "How people view AI, disinformation and elections \u2014 in charts\nPolls worldwide show an apprehension toward the emerging tech \u2014 and gaps in understanding how it works and its impact on election-related falsehoods.\n\nThis article is part of a series, Bots and ballots: How artificial intelligence is reshaping elections worldwide, presented by Luminate.\n\nSince OpenAI's ChatGPT went public in late 2022, artificial intelligence \u2014 everything from chatbots and deepfake videos to perceived apocalyptic threats associated with the technology \u2014 has taken the world by storm.\n\nBut the public's awareness of the emerging technology doesn't necessarily mean people understand what it is and what it can do. That's an important distinction in a year when more than 50 countries will go to the polls and the threat of AI-generated disinformation has become a political minefield.\n\nWhether you're in Jakarta, Madrid or Chicago, there's a divide between individuals' perceived understanding of artificial intelligence and their ability to name specific AI-powered products and services.\n\nInterestingly, those in developing economies \u2014 already accustomed to adapting quickly to newer technology like smartphones \u2014 report they better understand the emerging technology compared with their counterparts in more developed countries. They're also more likely to see the upsides of AI than its downsides, Ipsos polling data suggests.\n\nWhen it comes to disinformation \u2014 and not just falsehoods powered by AI \u2014 the entire world views it as a threat.\n\nYet in countries that rank at the middle or bottom of the United Nations' Human Development Index (HDI), which measures, among other things, a nation's ability to provide a decent standard of living, people are more worried about the future effects of disinformation on their elections compared with people in countries with higher HDI values like the United States and parts of the European Union, according to a joint Ipsos and UNESCO survey on the impact of online disinformation and hate speech.\n\nPeople in these so-called emerging economies have more faith in themselves to distinguish real and fake news than in an average person in their country being able to do the same.\n\nIn a year of elections across the world, people have already made the connection between disinformation and AI. More than 60 percent of people \u2014 across all countries surveyed by Ipsos in spring 2023 \u2014 said artificial intelligence could make it easier to create realistic fake news articles and images.\n\nGiven the role of the media and political parties in influencing how people vote this year, individuals were also suspicious of how news organizations used the technology, as well as how AI could generate political ads that targeted voters online.\n\nPessimism about the future is also widespread, according to data from Ipsos' report on global views of A.I. and disinformation.\n\nIn many countries, a majority said they thought AI would only lead to greater levels of online falsehoods, with so-called deepfakes \u2014 manipulated images, videos and audio clips, often of politicians \u2014 viewed as a particular concern when shaping public opinion.\n\nGiven the level of partisan division and technical expertise in the U.S., the country's November presidential election appears to be ground zero for how AI may be used to curry favor with voters. What happens in the U.S. will likely be copied elsewhere.\n\nDespite entrenched political divisions, Americans show a collective lack of trust in what they read online and think misinformation will only spread ahead of this fall's vote, according to U.S. polls conducted by KFF and the Associated Press and the NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.\n\nSkepticism about AI-power chatbots \u2014 automated tools that serve up information \u2014 is high among Americans, who have little interest in using such technology to inform themselves about politics. People surveyed also place the onus on tech companies \u2014 especially those behind popular AI tools \u2014 to prevent the spread of election-related, AI-generated false information.\n\nWhat's clear from scores of polling data that POLITICO reviewed was that people were both wary of artificial intelligence tools like ChatGPT and its rivals and concerned that disinformation was rife around elections.\n\nWhile such anxiety is palpable based on POLITICO's analysis of global polling data \u2014 and as interest in AI has increased \u2014 it's still unclear how much of a material impact AI-generated disinformation will have on 2024's litany of elections.\n\nThis article is part of a series, Bots and ballots: How artificial intelligence is reshaping elections worldwide, presented by Luminate.

        "text": "Supreme Court questions obstruction charges brought against Jan. 6 rioters and Trump\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Supreme Court on Tuesday questioned whether federal prosecutors went too far in bringing obstruction charges against hundreds of participants in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot. But it wasn\u2019t clear how the justices would rule in a case that also could affect the prosecution of former President Donald Trump, who faces the same charge for his efforts to overturn his election loss in 2020.\n\nThe justices heard arguments over the charge of obstruction of an official proceeding in the case of Joseph Fischer, a former Pennsylvania police officer who has been indicted for his role in disrupting Congress\u2019 certification of Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 presidential election victory over Trump. Fischer is one of 330 people facing that charge, which stems from a law passed in the aftermath of the Enron financial scandal more than two decades ago to deal with the destruction of documents.\n\nTrump is facing two charges in a separate case brought by special counsel Jack Smith in Washington that could be knocked out with a favorable ruling from the nation\u2019s highest court. Next week, the justices will hear arguments over whether the former president and presumptive nominee for the 2024 Republican nomination has \u201cabsolute immunity\u201d from prosecution in that case, a proposition that has so far been rejected by two lower courts.\n\nWhat to know about Trump\u2019s second term:\n\nStaffing the administration: Here are the people Trump has picked recess appointments Follow all of our coverage as Donald Trump assembles his second administration.\n\nSmith has argued separately in the immunity case that the obstruction charges against Trump are valid no matter how the court decides Fischer\u2019s case. The first former U.S. president under indictment, Trump is on trial on hush money charges in New York and also has been charged with election interference in Georgia and with mishandling classified documents in Florida.\n\nIt was not clear after more than 90 minutes of arguments precisely where the court would land in Fischer\u2019s case. Conservative justices Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch appeared most likely to side with Fischer, while liberal Justices Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor seemed more favorable to the Justice Department\u2019s position.\n\nJustices Amy Coney Barrett and Ketanji Brown Jackson, a former federal public defender, expressed interest in more of a middle-ground outcome that might make it harder, but not impossible, for prosecutors to use the obstruction charge.\n\nSome of the conservative justices said the law was so broad that it could be used against even peaceful protests and also questioned why the Justice Department has not brought charges under the provision in other violent protests.\n\n\u201cThere have been many violent protests that have interfered with proceedings,\u201d Justice Clarence Thomas said. He was back on the bench Tuesday after an unexplained one-day absence.\n\nSupporters of Donald Trump participate in a rally in Washington, Jan. 6, 2021.

Until the Capitol riot, lawyer Jeffrey Green told the court on Fischer\u2019s behalf, the provision \u201chad never been used to prosecute anything other than evidence tampering.\u201d\n\nFischer \u201cwas not part of the mob\u201d that forced lawmakers to flee the House and Senate chambers, Green wrote in court papers, noting that he entered the Capitol after Congress had recessed. The weight of the crowd pushed Fischer into a line of police inside, Green wrote.\n\nBut Prelogar, the administration\u2019s top Supreme Court lawyer, said the other side is reading the law too narrowly, arguing it serves as a \u201cclassic catchall\u201d designed to deal with the obstruction of an official proceeding. She said Fischer\u2019s actions before, during and after Jan. 6 demonstrated that he intended to keep Congress from doing its job of certifying the election results.\n\n\u201cHe had said in advance of Jan. 6 that he was prepared to storm the Capitol, prepared to use violence, he wanted to intimidate Congress,\u201d Prelogar said. \u201cHe said they can\u2019t vote if they can\u2019t breathe. And then he went to the Capitol on Jan. 6 with that intent in mind and took action, including assaulting a law enforcement officer.\n\nThe obstruction charge is among the most widely used felony charges brought in the massive federal prosecution following the violent insurrection. It carries a maximum prison term of 20 years, but Prelogar said the average term imposed so far is about two years.\n\nRoughly 170 Jan. 6 defendants have been convicted of obstructing or conspiring to obstruct the Jan. 6 joint session of Congress, including the leaders of two far-right extremist groups, the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers. A number of defendants have had their sentencings delayed until after the justices rule on the matter.\n\nSome rioters have even won early release from prison while the appeal is pending over concerns that they might end up serving longer than they should have if the Supreme Court rules against the Justice Department. They include Kevin Seefried, a Delaware man who threatened a Black police officer with a pole attached to a Confederate battle flag as he stormed the Capitol. Seefried was sentenced last year to three years behind bars, but a judge recently ordered that he be released one year into his prison term while awaiting the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling.\n\nMost lower court judges who have weighed in have allowed the charge to stand. Among them, U.S. District Judge Dabney Friedrich, a Trump appointee, wrote that \u201cstatutes often reach beyond the principal evil that animated them.\u201d\n\nBut U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols, another Trump appointee, dismissed the charge against Fischer and two other defendants, writing that prosecutors went too far. A divided panel of the federal appeals court in Washington reinstated the charge before the Supreme Court agreed to take up the case.\n\nMore than 1,350 people have been charged with Capitol riot-related federal crimes. Approximately 1,000 of them have pleaded guilty or been convicted by a jury or judge after a trial.\n\nA decision is expected by late June.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Alanna Durkin Richer in Washington and Michael Kunzelman in Silver Spring, Maryland, contributed to this report.",

Ahead of the 2024 presidential elections, this move has set the stage for all kinds of attacks on Donald Trump read more\n\nIt was tax day in the US. Thousands of Americans rushed to file their tax returns before the 15 April deadline. Among them were United States president Joe Biden and First Lady Dr Jill Biden. On Monday, they publicly released their 2023 financial details.\n\nThe release of the tax returns ahead of the 2024 US presidential elections is seen as a strategic move. Not only can Joe Biden use it to press on how different his tax policy is from the Republican frontrunner Donald Trump, but he can also use it to attack his rival on various related issues.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s a look at what the Bidens\u2019 tax returns reveal and how they could be used as a strong weapon in the incumbent US president\u2019s campaign for a second term.\n\nHow much taxes did the Bidens pay?\n\nThe Bidens filed their taxes jointly. The couple declared that they earned $619,976 in 2023. A large chunk of this amount came from Joe Biden\u2019s $400,000 salary and Dr Jill Biden\u2019s $85,985 compensation for her teaching job at a college in Virginia. Their income has gone up 6.5 per cent from $579,514 in 2022.\n\nIn 2023, the Bidens paid $146,629 in federal taxes- a rate of 23.7 per cent on their income.\n\nAdditionally, the president also paid $30,908 in income taxes to the state of Delaware. The first lady paid $3,549 in Virginia income taxes. The Bidens also reported charitable donations worth $20,477.\n\nWhat about Donald Trump\u2019s tax returns?\n\nTrump has refused both as a candidate and once in office to allow the public to see his tax return, a document detailing all sources and amounts of income, among other financial records, reports AFP.\n\nIn 2015, Trump declared as part of his candidacy, \u201cI\u2019m really rich.\u201d The former president has argued that voters have no need to see his tax data and that past financial disclosures are more than sufficient.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBillionaire businessman\u2019s tax returns for several years were made public after a legal battle waged by Democrats, It was revealed that Trump paid just $750 in taxes in 2016 and 2017. In 2018, he paid $1 million in income taxes. In 2019, he paid $133,445 in income taxes. In 2020, he paid no taxes at all, citing business losses.\n\nIs it compulsory for politicians to publicly release their taxes?\n\nPoliticians in the US are not legally required to publicly release their tax returns. The Bidens\u2019 public release of tax returns has highlighted at least two major differences in how the incumbent president and his predecessor Trump have dealt with their tax returns.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Bidens have publicly released their 2023 tax returns in line with an unwritten tradition of transparency that the White House has long followed. This custom, aimed at building trust in the country\u2019s leadership, was disrupted under Trump.\n\nFormer US President Donald Trump fought hard to not make his tax returns public | AP\n\nAnother difference is the amount of taxes the Bidens and Trump have paid. In the past couple of years, Jill and Joe Biden have paid over 20 per cent of their income in taxes. In comparison, Trump\u2019s tax payments have been rather small every year (except 2018).\n\nHow Joe Biden can turn the tax returns to his advantage\n\nAhead of the 2024 US presidential elections, slated for November, the Bidens are using the release of their tax returns as a powerful tool against Trump.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. Lack of transparency: A White House statement about the Bidens\u2019 tax returns took a jab at Trump and his lack of transparency regarding his income and taxes. The statement said that President Biden believes that \u201call occupants of the Oval Office should be open and honest with the American people\u201d. \u201cThe longstanding tradition of annually releasing presidential tax returns should continue unbroken,\u201d it added.\n\n2. Revealing a \u201cpeople-friendly\u201d tax policy: Close on the heels of the statement, came another release from the White House. This one, titled \u201cThis Tax Day, the Tax Contrast Couldn\u2019t Be Clearer,\u201d highlighted the differences between President Biden\u2019s and Trump\u2019s taxation policies. The release said that Joe Biden plans to crack down on tax avoidance by large multinationals and billionaires \u2013 another not-so-subtle jab at Trump and his ilk.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe release also added that the president wants to make corporations follow a tax rate of 28 per cent and tax billionaires a minimum of 25 per cent. It also hit out at the \u201cextreme Republican budget\u201d which proposes $5.5 trillion in tax cuts that are \u201cskewed to the wealthy and big corporations\u201d. Trump has maintained that tax cuts for corporations would prompt greater investment in the economy.\n\nREAD MORE: US presidential election: Biden improves his support, stands neck-to-neck with Trump, finds latest survey\n\n3. The base for attacking Trump\u2019s foreign accounts: Joe Biden\u2019s push for transparency around tax returns and income sources once again sets the stage for his attack on Trump\u2019s foreign accounts, especially those in China. Trump reportedly paid $200,000 in taxes to China. The existence of this account first came to light in a report by The New York Times. Biden had attacked Trump regarding this in the 2020 presidential debate, too.\n\nThe Bidens\u2019 public release of their tax returns accords greater legitimacy to these attacks, clearly distinguishing them from Trump.\n\nTaxes, the economy, and inflation in the US are all crucial issues that matter to voters. How convincing Trump and Biden are on these topics is likely to play a key role in the upcoming polls.\n\nWith inputs from agencies\n\nGet all the latest updates of US Elections 2024",

        "text": "Beyond the Blue Wall: Exploring the Risks of Political Unrest in the 2024 Presidential Election\nAmid the escalating fervor surrounding the 2024 presidential election, public discourse often revolves around the significance of pivotal states referred to as \u2018swing states,\u2019 \u2018purple states,\u2019 or \u2018battleground states.\u2019 While these terms are sometimes used interchangeably by political commentators, they generally denote states where the electoral outcome remains uncertain and whose voters are poised to influence the election\u2019s outcome. The concept of swing states, though a relatively modern phenomenon popularized after the 1980s, is deeply entrenched in the electoral process, as reflected in the Electoral College framework outlined in the Constitution. Concerns over the Electoral College system persist, particularly regarding issues like the winner-takes-all allocation of electoral votes, which amplifies the influence of a handful of swing states while marginalizing others. In the context of the 2024 election, pundits have identified six swing states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.\n\nHistorically known as the \u2018blue wall\u2019 for their decades-long alignment with the Democratic Party, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin have witnessed pivotal shifts, notably in the 2016 election when Donald Trump secured victory in those states. Trump\u2019s narrow victory in 2016 and Joe Biden\u2019s win in 2020 by a slightly larger margin highlight the volatility of swing states and the intense focus politicians place on winning them. In 2020, mobilization spurred by the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement found fertile ground in these states. Likewise, Biden\u2019s 2020 victory sparked claims of election fraud from former President Trump and his allies, heightening the risks that extremist movements may take arms to influence the electoral outcome in some key states. This report reviews the latest trends in demonstration activity and extremist mobilization in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, identifying whether and how these states may stoke risks of election-related violence.\n\nMichigan\n\nLike Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, Michigan was previously a stronghold for Democrats, who won the state in seven of the last 10 presidential election cycles. Biden\u2019s ability to flip the state in 2020 helps to further illustrate why politicians spend a disproportionate amount of time and resources trying to secure votes in battleground states.\n\nBecause of the important role Michigan could very well play in the upcoming election, pundits and researchers alike have started to investigate what is most important to Michigan voters. Unsurprisingly, a recent survey suggested that the economy was the highest priority for nearly a third of Michigan voters. Yet, in recent months, the popular outcry over the Israel-Gaza conflict has served as a strong driver of mobilization, surpassing labor-related issues. Pro-Palestine demonstrations have accounted for the largest share of all reported demonstrations in the state (42%) since the start of the new year (see graph below). These demonstrations have also catalyzed a strong opposition to the policies of the Biden administration, with Michigan seeing the second-highest rate of anti-Biden demonstrations recorded throughout the country since January 2024 after New York. This finding aligns with reports of \u2018protest voting\u2019 during the Michigan primary to oppose the Biden administration\u2019s approach to the war. This may be of particular relevance in Michigan, which has the largest per capita Arab American population in the country. In Dearborn, the seventh-most populous city in Michigan, the majority of the population claims Middle Eastern or North African heritage.\n\nAt the same time, Michigan is well-acquainted with far-right extremism; in April 2020, armed far-right extremists stormed the capital demanding Governor Gretchen Whitmer\u2019s resignation as they protested COVID-19 mandates. Roughly six months later, a small far-right paramilitary group, the Wolverine Watchmen , captured national attention as it conspired to kidnap Whitmer. While the kidnapping plot was the most notable example of extremist activity in Michigan, such activity has continued in the following years (see map below). Michigan ranks eighth among all US states for militia-related events \u2014 which include trainings, demonstrations, and other propaganda activities \u2014 between January 2023 and March 2024. ACLED data also show that white nationalist organizing quadrupled in Michigan during 2022 and 2023, suggesting that activity could continue to increase in the coming year.\n\nFurther, reports of far-right activity at the local government level suggest that far-right groups may attempt to influence the upcoming election. According to the FBI, election workers in Michigan have received an \u201cunusual level of threats.\u201d In fact, the presence of multiple election deniers on the ballot and exposure to threats and harassment have triggered mass resignations among the state\u2019s election workers.\n\nA link between far-right factions of the Republican Party and extremist groups is apparent in Ottawa County. Tied with Kalamazoo and Ingham, Ottawa County has experienced the third-most far-right activity in Michigan since the beginning of 2023, after the state\u2019s most-populous Wayne and Oakland counties. In 2023, a group of far-right Republicans took control of Ottawa County\u2019s board, unseating seven traditional Republicans. The group, known as Ottawa Impact, fired the county administrator and county counsel, appointed a new officer of public health, and closed the county\u2019s office of diversity, equity, and inclusion. The new board also adopted a new slogan for the county and promised to \u201crecognize our nation\u2019s Judeo-Christian heritage and celebrate America as an exceptional nation blessed by God,\u201d a stance that leans toward Christian nationalism.\n\nIn a similar development, election officials in Hillsdale County\u2019s Adams Township, in southern Michigan, are receiving national attention after a recall vote ousted an election clerk who questioned the outcome of the 2020 election. Despite the recall vote, many in the township are still troubled by the potential for violence during the upcoming election. This fear has only intensified as \u2018America First Republicans\u2019 splintered off from the county\u2019s Republican Party and appointed the former leader of Michigan\u2019s Christian Hutaree Militia to lead the group.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nThe Keystone State is often considered a bellwether as the majority of candidates in the past 10 elections who won Pennsylvania also went on to win the presidency. Pennsylvanians have largely supported Democrats, making Trump\u2019s victory in 2016 a surprise to pollsters who predicted that Hillary Clinton would win the state. Trump\u2019s victory in Pennsylvania was the first time a Republican won the state since 1988. The previous two elections were won by razor-thin margins, with Trump besting Clinton by less than 1% and Biden winning by a similarly thin margin of just over 1%. Pennsylvania\u2019s reputation as a tight race continues, with this year\u2019s polling suggesting that 2024 will likely be a very close race.\n\nA recent poll of Pennsylvanians and Michiganders finds similarities between the two states\u2019 voters, with residents from both states saying the economy is their primary concern when considering their vote in November. Since 2022 labor demonstrations have accounted for a large share of demonstration activity in the state, as unions called strikes often. Yet, demonstrations over the Israel-Gaza conflict have increasingly served as a powerful mobilization driver in Pennsylvania (see graph below). Nearly a third of all demonstrations in the state were reportedly in support of Palestine, with Pennsylvania ranking fourth for the most demonstrations related to Israel and Palestine after New York, California, and Massachusetts. Unlike Michigan, though, no anti-Biden demonstrations were reported in Pennsylvania. Indeed, as the state is home to a substantially smaller Middle Eastern population per capita than Michigan, it is unclear if the Biden administration\u2019s handling of the conflict in Gaza will have the same relevance for Pennsylvanians as it does for Michiganders.\n\nAs with Michigan, there have also been concerns regarding far-right extremism in Pennsylvania. A recent report from the Southern Poverty Law Center found that there were 72 hate and anti-government groups in Pennsylvania in 2022, up from the 30 known groups in 2021. Despite this jump, there has been limited militia activity in Pennsylvania, with only one reported event in 2024. Yet, the increase in the number of known groups is something to watch in the run-up to the election (see map below). In 2020, far-right actors in Pennsylvania mobilized especially in response to the BLM movement, with activity spiking between April and Election Day. Two years later, a Democratic candidate running for a state House of Representatives seat was attacked in his home in North Union Township near Uniontown, in what he believed to be election-related harassment. Previously, the candidate said, a threatening message was graffitied on his garage door and, in another incident, the windows of his home were broken with a brick. Moreover, Pennsylvania is also home to some of the largest numbers of people prosecuted over the 6 January Capitol riot. With prior mobilization around election periods, the upcoming election may provide a powerful call to action for several militias, street fighting organizations, and vigilante groups that exist in the state, particularly if claims of election fraud arise.\n\nWisconsin\n\nWisconsin is the final swing state from the so-called blue wall. This point has not been lost on either Trump or Biden, and both have made recent visits to the state. As with both Michigan and Pennsylvania, the previous two elections were very close in Wisconsin. Trump\u2019s margin of victory was approximately 1% in 2016, and Biden also won with less than a 1% margin in 2020. One resounding difference between Wisconsin and its blue wall counterparts is the disproportionate share of independent voters. A recent Pew survey found that 16% of Wisconsinites identify as independent, with the remaining evenly split between Republican and Democratic Party affiliation. Independent voters will likely be an important voting bloc, which helps explain why candidates may make frequent stops to the state. In addition to the importance of independent voters, the white working class will likely play an important role. In the 2016 elections, increased turnout among white non-college-educated voters in Wisconsin seemingly played a decisive role in turning the state for Trump.\n\nWhile the economy is undoubtedly of high importance for Wisconsin voters, a recent study found that abortion remains a key issue. Demonstration activity is aligned with public opinion. ACLED data suggest that support for abortion rights accounts for a disproportionate share of all demonstrations recorded in the state, with Wisconsin ranking sixth nationwide for pro-abortion rights demonstrations since January 2023 (see graph below). Similar to Michigan and Pennsylvania, pro-Palestine demonstrations made up a high proportion of demonstrations in Wisconsin (38%) in the first quarter of 2024, suggesting that Biden may need to work to win over many who are unhappy with the administration\u2019s handling of the Israel-Gaza conflict.\n\nWhile Wisconsin does not have a strong presence of far-right groups (see map below), the Southern Poverty Law Center has identified several hate and anti-government groups in the state in 2022. However, there has been a steady increase in the activity of white nationalist groups in Wisconsin over the past four years. A notable example is the Blood Tribe, a neo-Nazi group founded in 2020, whose Wisconsin chapter was especially active in the second half of 2023, ACLED data show. Overall, 2023 was a record-high year for far-right groups in the state.\n\nIn addition to these trends, watchdogs have also voiced concern about the upcoming election in Wisconsin. Cities across the state have expanded laws aimed at protecting election officials during the election and beyond, in large part due to reporting of drastic increases in threats and harassment to poll workers. Further, concern about the integrity of elections has increased as the previous election administrator, Meagan Wolfe, was forced out of office by the Republican-run state Senate.",

        "text": "US reimposes oil sanctions on Venezuela as hopes for a fair presidential election fades\nMIAMI (AP) \u2014 The Biden administration on Wednesday reimposed crushing oil sanctions on Venezuela, admonishing President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s attempts to consolidate his rule just six months after the U.S. eased restrictions in a bid to support now fading hopes for a democratic opening in the OPEC nation.\n\nA senior U.S. official, discussing the decision with reporters, said any U.S. company investing in Venezuela would have 45 days to wind down operations to avoid adding uncertainty to global energy markets. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss U.S. policy deliberations.\n\nIn October, the U.S. granted Maduro\u2019s government relief from sanctions on its state-run oil, gas and mining sectors after it agreed to work with members of the opposition to hold a free and competitive presidential election this year.\n\nWhile Maduro went on to schedule an election for July and invite international observers to monitor voting, his inner circle has used the ruling party\u2019s total control over Venezuela\u2019s institutions to undermine the agreement. Actions include blocking his main rival, ex lawmaker Maria Corina Machado, from registering her candidacy or that of a designated alternative. Numerous government critics have also been jailed over the past six months, including several of Machado\u2019s aides.\n\nWednesday\u2019s actions essentially return U.S. policy to what it was prior to the agreement hammered out in the Caribbean island of Barbados, making it illegal for U.S. companies to do business with state-run oil producer Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela S.A., better known as PDVSA, without a specific license from the U.S. Treasury Department.\n\n\u201cWe again call on Maduro to allow all candidates and parties to participate in the electoral process and release all political prisoners without restrictions or delay,\u201d State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said. \u201cWe will continue to support Venezuelans\u2019 aspirations for a more democratic, stable, and prosperous Venezuela.\u201d\n\nVenezuelan authorities angrily dismissed the diplomatic rebuke, saying it fulfilled its commitments made in Barbados and accusing Washington of betraying a promise to lift all sanctions it said was made during secret negotiations between the two countries.\n\n\u201cThe gringos think they can threaten Venezuela,\u201d said Maduro in a televised event. \u201cThere\u2019s no sanction, no threat, that today can damage our efforts to build a new productive economic model because we no longer depend on anyone in the world, just our own work.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what impact the snapback would have on Venezuela\u2019s long floundering oil and gas industry \u2014 or whether it will pressure Maduro to offer a more level electoral playing field.\n\nThe initial reprieve was issued for only six months. Experts say that\u2019s not nearly enough time to attract the major capital investments required to revive long stagnant production in Venezuela, which sits atop the world\u2019s largest proven oil reserves.\n\nHowever, by allowing Venezuela to send oil directly, instead of going through shady middlemen who charge a hefty fee, Maduro\u2019s government was able to boost oil revenues and raise badly needed cash during the six months of U.S. sanctions relief.\n\nAdditionally, the stiffening of sanctions doesn\u2019t directly impact Chevron, the last major U.S. oil driller in Venezuela, which was allowed to boost shipments thanks to a license it was issued in 2022 amid concerns that Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine would disrupt global energy supplies.\n\n\u201cThe true test of the administration\u2019s seriousness about Venezuela is Chevron,\u201d said Elliott Abrams, who served as the Trump administration\u2019s special envoy to the crisis in Venezuela. \u201cLeaving that license in place suggests the administration cares more about keeping oil prices down until the election, and about Chevron\u2019s profits, than about U.S. national security interests and freedom in Venezuela.\u201d\n\nWhile signaling its growing frustration with Maduro, the Biden administration is unlikely to return to the failed \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign tried during the Trump administration, which only strengthened the leftist leader\u2019s hand, experts said.\n\n\u201cIt became impossible for the White House to pretend that the Maduro government in any way was complying \u2014 or even intended to comply \u2014 with the implicit deal in the partial lifting of sanctions,\u201d said Christopher Sabatini, a research fellow at the Chatham House in London. \u201cTo have ignored that would have made the U.S. look weak and undermined the its credibility in leveraging sanctions not just on Venezuela but elsewhere.\u201d\n\nOpinion polls show most Venezuelans would eagerly boot Maduro from office if given half a chance. Numerous regional leaders, including the leftist presidents of Colombia and Brazil, have joined the U.S. in criticizing the Maduro government\u2019s failure to abide by its commitments and allow a competitive election.\n\n\u2014\n\nGarcia Cano reported from Mexico City.",

Numerous government critics have also been jailed over the past six months, including several of Machado\u2019s aides.\n\nREAD MORE: Venezuela\u2019s main opposition coalition unable to register a presidential candidate\n\nWednesday\u2019s actions essentially return U.S. policy to what it was prior to the agreement hammered out in the Caribbean island of Barbados, making it illegal for U.S. companies to do business with state-run oil producer Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela S.A., better known as PDVSA, without a specific license from the U.S. Treasury Department.\n\n\u201cWe again call on Maduro to allow all candidates and parties to participate in the electoral process and release all political prisoners without restrictions or delay,\u201d State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said. \u201cWe will continue to support Venezuelans\u2019 aspirations for a more democratic, stable, and prosperous Venezuela.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what impact the snapback would have on Venezuela\u2019s long floundering oil and gas industry \u2014 or whether it will pressure Maduro to offer a more level electoral playing field.\n\nThe initial reprieve was issued for only six months. Experts say that\u2019s not nearly enough time to attract the major capital investments required to revive long stagnant production in Venezuela, which sits atop the world\u2019s largest proven oil reserves.\n\nHowever, by allowing Venezuela to send oil directly, instead of going through shady middlemen who charge a hefty fee, Maduro\u2019s government was able to boost oil revenues and raise badly needed cash during the six months of U.S. sanctions relief.\n\nREAD MORE: ExxonMobil to explore for oil and gas in offshore area under dispute by Guyana and Venezuela\n\nAdditionally, the stiffening of sanctions doesn\u2019t directly impact Chevron, the last major U.S. oil driller in Venezuela, which was allowed to boost shipments thanks to a license it was issued in 2022 amid concerns that Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine would disrupt global energy supplies.\n\n\u201cThe true test of the administration\u2019s seriousness about Venezuela is Chevron,\u201d said Elliott Abrams, who served as the Trump administration\u2019s special envoy to the crisis in Venezuela. \u201cLeaving that license in place suggests the administration cares more about keeping oil prices down until the election, and about Chevron\u2019s profits, than about U.S. national security interests and freedom in Venezuela.\u201d\n\nWhile signaling its growing frustration with Maduro, the Biden administration is unlikely to return to the failed \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign tried during the Trump administration, which only strengthened the leftist leader\u2019s hand, experts said.\n\n\u201cIt became impossible for the White House to pretend that the Maduro government in any way was complying \u2014 or even intended to comply \u2014 with the implicit deal in the partial lifting of sanctions,\u201d said Christopher Sabatini, a research fellow at the Chatham House in London. \u201cTo have ignored that would have made the U.S. look weak and undermined the its credibility in leveraging sanctions not just on Venezuela but elsewhere.\u201d\n\nOpinion polls show most Venezuelans would eagerly boot Maduro from office if given half a chance. Numerous regional leaders, including the leftist presidents of Colombia and Brazil, have joined the U.S. in criticizing the Maduro government\u2019s failure to abide by its commitments and allow a competitive election.\n\nGarcia Cano reported from Mexico City.",

        "text": "Microsoft finds Russian influence operations targeting US election have begun\nMicrosoft said on Wednesday that Russian online campaigns to influence the upcoming U.S. presidential election kicked into gear over the past 45 days, but at a slower pace than in past elections.\n\nRussia-linked accounts are disseminating divisive content aimed at U.S. audiences, including criticizing American support of Ukraine in its war with Russia, researchers at the tech giant said in a report.\n\nThe Russian embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment, but the Kremlin said last month it would not meddle in the November U.S. election. It also dismissed U.S. allegations that it orchestrated campaigns to sway the 2016 and 2020 U.S. presidential elections.\n\nWhile the Russian activity Microsoft observed is not as intense as around the previous elections, it could increase in the coming months, the researchers said.\n\n\"Messaging regarding Ukraine \u2014 via traditional media and social media \u2014 picked up steam over the last two months with a mix of covert and overt campaigns from at least 70 Russia-affiliated activity sets we track,\" Microsoft said.\n\nThe most prolific of such Russian campaigns is linked to Russia's Presidential Administration, they added. Another one is aimed at posting disinformation online in various languages, with posts typically starting with an apparent whistleblower or citizen journalist posting content on a video channel. That content is then covered by a network of websites that include DC Weekly, Miami Chronical and The Intel Drop.\n\n\"Ultimately, after the narrative has circulated online for a series of days or weeks, U.S. audiences repeat and repost this disinformation, likely unaware of its original source,\" Microsoft said.\n\nA \"notable uptick\" has been seen in hacking by a Russian group Microsoft calls Star Blizzard, or Cold River, which is focused on targeting western think tanks, the company said.\n\n\"Star Blizzard's current focus on U.S. political figures and policy circles may be the first in a series of hacking campaigns meant to drive Kremlin outcomes headed into November.\"\n\nMalicious use of artificial intelligence by foreign rivals targeting the U.S. election is a key concern cited by American political observers, but Microsoft said it found that simpler digital forgeries were more common than deepfakes. Audio manipulations have a bigger impact than video, it added.\n\n\"Rarely have nation-states' employments of generative AI-enabled content achieved much reach across social media, and in only a few cases have we seen any genuine audience deception from such content,\" the researchers said.\n\n\"The simplest manipulations, not the most complex employment of AI, will likely be the pieces of content that have the most impact.\"",

        "summary": " The policy contrasts between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are sharpening as the general election campaign gets underway . What does the choice represent for ordinary voters and the economic and cultural issues they care about? Here are seven big issues at stake in the 2024 election .",
        "text": "7 big issues at stake in the 2024 election\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The policy contrasts between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are sharpening as the general election campaign gets fully underway.\n\nBut what does the choice represent for ordinary voters and the economic and cultural issues they care about? A rematch between the Democratic incumbent and his Republican predecessor may feel uninspiring to many voters, but the policy stakes are enormous for tens of millions of Americans \u2014 and the world.\n\nHere are seven big issues at stake in the 2024 election.\n\nAbortion\n\nThe contrast: Biden favors federal abortion protections; Trump opposes them. Trump supported nationwide restrictions on abortion as president but now downplays the need for a federal ban, as Republicans are divided over the issue. Biden does not support federal limits.\n\nBiden has championed the Women\u2019s Health Protection Act, a bill to protect abortion rights in all 50 states under federal law and prohibit medically unnecessary hurdles to accessing the procedure. He has asked voters to send him a Democratic Congress that supports legal abortion to achieve that.\n\nTrump has boasted that he \"broke Roe v. Wade\" by picking three of the five Supreme Court justices who overturned it, delivering on a four-decade goal of the GOP. More recently, Trump has openly fretted that the backlash may cost him and his party the election. Last week, Trump said the issue should be left to states, a shift from his support for nationwide restrictions when he was president. His new stance has drawn pushback from GOP allies, like Sen. Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, and anti-abortion-rights advocates, who say that he is wrong and that Republicans should not be deterred from their long-standing goal of enacting some nationwide abortion limits.\n\nSome Republicans downplay the prospects of federal abortion restrictions\u2019 passing Congress, even if they win full control. Biden and his allies are telling voters to look at the GOP\u2019s long history of championing federal restrictions and not their recent rhetoric.\n\nImmigration\n\nThe contrast: Trump has promised a sweeping crackdown on illegal immigration and tougher executive actions; Biden is asking Congress to give him more tools to manage an overwhelmed border and create new legal pathways to immigrate to the U.S.\n\nTrump has called existing border laws an existential threat to the U.S., saying migrants are \u201cpoisoning the blood of our country\u201d and bringing new \u201clanguages.\u201d His campaign website says: \u201cPresident Trump will shut down Biden\u2019s border disaster. He will again end catch-and-release, restore Remain in Mexico, and eliminate asylum fraud. In cooperative states, President Trump will deputize the National Guard and local law enforcement to assist with rapidly removing illegal alien gang members and criminals.\u201d\n\nAfter having rescinded some of Trump's policies, Biden has recently shifted to support stricter immigration laws as the system remains overwhelmed. He championed a bipartisan bill to raise the bar for gaining asylum, grant more U.S. resources to process asylum claims and turn away migrants who do not qualify, and empower the president to temporarily shut down the border if migration levels hit certain triggers. (Republicans blocked the bill in the Senate amid lobbying by Trump, who wants to use the border as an election issue.) Biden has also endorsed the U.S. Citizenship Act, which would grant a pathway to citizenship for people in the U.S. illegally if they pass background checks and pay their taxes.\n\nFundamentally, Trump has aligned with forces who want less immigration into the country, while Biden has embraced the belief that immigrants make the U.S. better.\n\nHealth care and prescription drugs\n\nThe contrast: Biden wants to extend Affordable Care Act provisions and empower Medicare to negotiate more prescription drugs; Trump has aggressively criticized the ACA but not offered a health care plan.\n\nBiden, who was vice president when the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010, sees it as a cherished achievement to protect and strengthen. The law, also known as \"Obamacare,\" which has extended coverage to 45 million people through subsidies, insurance mandates and a Medicaid expansion, continues to face conservative opposition.\n\nSeparately, Biden has touted a provision in his party-line Inflation Reduction Act that empowers Medicare to negotiate lower prices for 10 prescription drugs. He said he wants to boost that to 50 if he is re-elected, with the goal of $200 billion in savings.\n\nTrump spent his four years as president fighting unsuccessfully to repeal and unravel the law \u2014 through legislation and executive action and endorsing lawsuits to wipe it out. In November, Trump called for revisiting plans to \"terminate\" the ACA. He has recently sought to downplay that and insists he only wants to improve the law. But he has not offered a health care plan. Many of his GOP allies in Congress still favor repealing or undoing the ACA, including a budget by the Republican Study Committee, which boasts about 80% of the House GOP conference as members, including Speaker Mike Johnson, of Louisiana.\n\nTaxes\n\nThe contrast: Trump's 2017 tax cuts expire at the end of next year, and he has called for extending them; Biden has called for raising taxes on families earning over $400,000 to fund various priorities.\n\nA series of Trump tax cuts, which Republicans passed on a party-line basis in 2017, expire at the end of 2025. Congress and the winner of the election will decide what happens to them.\n\nIn a recent private speech to wealthy donors, Trump said his policies include \"extending the Trump tax cuts\" if he is elected, according to a Trump campaign official. That would preserve lower rates across the income spectrum, with the biggest benefits for top earners.\n\nBiden has attacked that law as a giveaway to the wealthiest Americans, vowing to make \"big corporations and the very wealthy finally pay their fair share.\" He has backed a corporate tax rate hike from 21% to 28% and said that \"nobody earning less than $400,000 will pay an additional penny in federal taxes.\" Biden is also calling for a $3,600-per-child tax cut for families, an $800 average tax break for \"front-line workers\" and a 25% minimum tax on billionaires, according to a newly released campaign plank.\n\nThe expiration of the Trump tax cuts will restore the unlimited federal deduction for state and local taxes, which Republicans had capped at $10,000 in the 2017 law. Republicans broadly support preserving the cap, with some exceptions, while most Democrats want to lift it.\n\nJudges and the Supreme Court\n\nThe contrast: Their track records tell a clear story. Trump has picked young conservative judges to serve on the federal bench, while Biden has picked liberals with a focus on professional and personal diversity.\n\nOne of the clearest contrasts is what kinds of judges Trump and Biden would pick for lifetime appointments on the federal courts. A simple way for voters to think about it is whether they prefer new judges with the conservative views of Justice Neil Gorsuch, Trump's first Supreme Court pick, or with the liberal views of Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, Biden's (so far only) high court pick.\n\nAs president, Trump nominated young conservative judges who will serve for generations. Biden has focused on finding judges with diverse backgrounds and r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, including more civil rights lawyers and public defenders.\n\nPerhaps the biggest question is whether a Supreme Court vacancy will open up in the next four years. The presidential election winner and the party that controls the Senate would fill it.\n\nTrade\n\nThe contrast: Trump is pushing a 10% across-the-board tariff on imports; Biden's White House opposes that, saying it would raise inflation.\n\nTrump, long a skeptic of U.S. trade deals, has proposed to impose a 10% tariff on all imported goods if he returns to the White House. He recently told Fox News that it could be 60% \u2014 or potentially \u201cmore than that\u201d \u2014 on imports of Chinese goods.\n\nBiden opposes that idea. In a memo over the weekend, the White House slammed the idea of \"across-the-board tariffs that would raise taxes and prices by $1,500 per American family,\" without naming Trump; it referred to an estimate by the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, that Trump's 10% tax on imports could cost an average American household $1,500 per year.\n\nBiden, instead, has sought to boost domestic manufacturing with major federal investments in semiconductors and electric vehicles.\n\nForeign policy and NATO\n\nThe contrast: Biden favors Ukraine aid, while Trump is skeptical of it; Biden supports NATO and a traditional view of American power, while Trump has criticized NATO and voiced some isolationist views.\n\nThe clearest example of the foreign policy differences between the two concerns the fate of Ukraine, which is running low on ammunition and says it needs U.S. assistance to continue holding off Russia\u2019s aggression. Biden is an ardent proponent of helping Ukraine, while Trump has poured cold water on U.S. aid to Ukraine and successfully pressured House Republicans to block it since they took the majority in January 2023.\n\nAnd that points to a deeper divide: Biden is an outspoken supporter of the NATO alliance as a bulwark against adversaries like Russia and China and of preserving the post-World War II order. Trump has dialed up his criticisms of NATO and aligned with a growing isolationist wing in the U.S. that wants to be less involved in global affairs. Trump recently said that as president, he \u201cwould encourage\u201d Russia \u201cto do whatever the hell they want\u201d to member countries who are \u201cdelinquent\u201d in their dues.",

        "text": "Will voters in 2024 election be swayed by culture war issues?\nNew culture war issues have steadily made headlines in recent years, with politicians nationwide putting identity-based issues at the center of their legislative agendas, political strategists told ABC News.\n\nDespite their prevalence in the political arena, strategists say the question of whether these issues will be major motivators for the upcoming election remains unanswered.\n\nWhat are the culture wars?\n\n\"Culture war issues aren't new, they're just different,\" said Alex Conant, a GOP political strategist who worked on Marco Rubio's 2016 presidential campaign, in an interview with ABC News.\n\nDifferent social ideologies have been pitted against one another in order to define America\u2019s identity for decades, political strategists told ABC News.\n\nIn the late 1900s and into the 2000s, some of the bedrock culture war issues were abortion, gay marriage, civil rights, and gun control, according to Democratic political strategist Jon Reinish. However, these issues are mainstream and largely popular: the majority of Americans are in support of abortion rights, gay marriage, civil rights, and gun control, Pew Research Center studies show.\n\nDemonstrators during a march calling for safe legal abortions for all women, in New York City, N.Y., 1978. Keystone/Hulton Archive/Getty Images, FILE\n\nEnter a new wave of culture war issues to put Republicans and Democrats at odds: anti-transgender policies; \u201cwoke\u201d-ness; diversity, equity and inclusion programs; critical race theory; immigration.\n\nRepublican-backed anti-transgender state policies have largely been focused on restricting gender-affirming medical care for transgender people under 18, banning transgender girls from participating in girls\u2019 sports, and allowing teachers and state employees to use a trans person's given name or pronouns that match their sex assigned at birth instead of their preferred name or pronouns.\n\nPresident Joe Biden speaks with US Customs and Border Protection officers as he visits the US-Mexico border in El Paso, Texas, Jan. 8, 2023. Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images, FILE\n\nDemocrat-backed state policies have enshrined access to gender-affirming health care, implemented anti-discrimination policies in schools and workplaces for LGBTQ people, and more in response to conservative-led efforts.\n\nWhen it comes to education, some Republican legislators are proposing or implementing restrictions on classroom content and discussion \u2013 largely based on the topics of race and the LGBTQ community, or topics seen by some as \u201cdivisive,\" like critical race theory (CRT). Some of these laws also target diversity, equity and inclusion programs (DEI) in K-12 schools, higher education and the workplace.\n\nDemocratic state and local legislators have instead aligned themselves in opposition, implementing programs and policies to promote access to diverse content and programs.\n\nImmigration, which Democratic strategist Basil A. Smikle argues is a part of U.S. culture wars, will be another centerpiece of the 2024 election.\n\nBorder security was at the center of Donald Trump's successful 2016 presidential campaign, energizing his supporters against what's been dubbed a \"border crisis,\" as border states face sometimes hundreds of thousands of migrant encounters. Biden has campaigned opposite Trump, promising to cut controversial policies implemented by the former president, including COVID-era migrant expulsion practices like Title 42.\n\nHowever, Biden has since said he's open to reforms to asylum laws and other changes to border policy. According to the Migrant Policy Institute, Biden has taken more than 500 actions on immigration in his presidency thus far.\n\nReproductive rights is a bedrock culture wars issues that continues to be front and center for people across the country.\n\nTrump and Republicans have long championed Trump's role in ending Roe v. Wade's guarantees to nationwide abortion access. Several Republican-led states have since ceased nearly all abortion services, while Democrats have moved to codify abortion and reproductive rights on the state level.\n\nWill these issues move the election?\n\n\"They have a checkered history in terms of actually swaying elections,\" said Reinish.\n\nStrategists say that some culture war issues \u2013 like anti-transgender policies, DEI and CRT \u2013 don\u2019t appear by themselves to be key overall issues for voters.\n\n\u201cIt's not really registering maybe as it had in the past,\u201d said Robert Blizzard, a GOP pollster who previously worked for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. \u201cI think it's just simply being crowded out by problems that families are actually facing on a day-to-day basis, like inflation, rising costs, the border, crime.\u201d\n\nPolitical strategists say these issues are all about animating the base: \"They're really talking to their own base, that's gonna be their bread and butter,\u201d Conant said.\n\nFor independent voters in particular, politicians who focus on culture wars issues are \"going to alienate voters across the board,\" said Democratic pollster Zac McCrary in an interview. In a focus group among independent voters, McCrary found that \"they're just not paying attention to that.\"\n\n\"Voters always ask themselves, 'what does this have to do with my family, my job, my home, my prospects as an American,'\" said Reinish, who argues that culture war terms like CRT and DEI are fad issues that can be harder to understand.\n\nA teacher in Santa Ana and a parent of transgender child protests against the transgender notification policy outside the Orange Unified School District meeting where the board decided if OUSD would implement a transgender notification policy in Orange on Sept. 7, 2023. Leonard Ortiz/Orange County Register via Getty Images, FILE\n\nThe top general concerns for voters continue to be strengthening the economy and lowering costs across the board, strategists say, and Pew surveys show.\n\nHowever, reproductive rights and tackling immigration are among the issues that are top of mind for voters, according to Pew. Improving education also is on the top of voters' minds, but, according to Pew, the conversations around schools are nuanced regarding not just content on culture wars issues but parental involvement, the impact of COVID-19 on learning, and more.\n\nCampaigns with culture wars at the center\n\nSome say Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis' failure on the national stage as a Republican presidential candidate may have been his overwhelming association with his war on \"woke,\" with Trump claiming \"half the people can\u2019t even define [woke], they don\u2019t know what it is,\u201d at an Iowa event.\n\n\"DeSantis staked his entire campaign political messaging-wise, legislatively on the very concept of anti-wokeness. Ask Ron DeSantis how that went for him,\" said Reinish. \"He's the most prominent example that was widely unsuccessful.\"\n\nConant argued: \"DeSantis didn't work out too well -- it was telling that in the last several debates he didn't even mention the word 'woke.' It went from being what made him a national star\" to being his weakness, he said in an interview.\n\nFormer Republican presidential candidate and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis speaks at a Concerned Women for America Summit at the Capitol Hilton, Sept. 15, 2023, in Washington. Andrew Harnik/AP, FILE\n\nHowever, others say several factors besides the culture wars campaign went into DeSantis' downfall.\n\n\"I think the presidential primary was much larger than just that type of stuff,\" said Blizzard. \"Trump was also doing really well with evangelical voters. He was doing well with economic conservative types,\" said Blizzard.\n\nConant points to Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin's win three years ago as proof that cultural issues can mobilize moderate voters, since Youngkin was a warrior against school content on racial issues and critical race theory (CRT). However, the Virginia legislature was later captured by Democrats in last year's election.\n\nIn Kentucky, transgender identities became a hot button issue in the governor's rare: Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear bested Republican Kelly Craft in the deep red state. Craft railed against \"woke\" policies and had said that if she was elected, \"we will not have transgenders in our school system,\" according to the Associated Press.\n\nThough the longevity of new culture war issues is yet to be determined, Blizzard and Smikle don't believe political battles over cultural issues are going away any time soon.\n\n\"Every kind of topic creates a new issue that the right and the left are battling over,\" said Blizzard.\n\nSmikle adds, \"This is also a proxy for concerns around change and diversity -- the diversification of our nation ... You're gonna have to figure out where the next battleground will be.\"",

        "text": "After a sleepy primary season, Russia enters 2024 U.S. election fray\nRussian influence operations targeting the 2024 U.S. elections have ramped up in the past 45 days, using Telegram as a primary distribution channel to spread propaganda to influence debate over Ukraine policy, according to new research from Microsoft\u2019s Threat Analysis Center.\n\nThe rise in observed activity represents a late start for Moscow compared to efforts in 2020 and 2016, something Microsoft attributed to an uncompetitive presidential primary season that saw Donald Trump and Joe Biden cruise to their respective nominations with minimal resistance. Unlike in 2016 and 2020, when one or both parties were ensconced in heavily contested and contentious intraparty primaries, this cycle presented little motivation and fewer opportunities for foreign nations to move the needle with meddling.\n\nThat dynamic has changed as the race shifts to the general election, and Microsoft has tracked multiple groups targeting the U.S. elections and 70 different Russian-associated \u201cactivity sets\u201d worldwide pushing content and messaging in English, Spanish, French, Arabic, Finnish and other languages designed to degrade international support for Ukraine, portray President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as the head of a corrupt state and diminish the appetite of Western governments to further fund the Ukrainian war cause.\n\n\u201cOftentimes when we\u2019re watching the activity that comes out of these actor sets, some people characterize it as they want to make chaos in the U.S. or they want to create problems for democracies. \u2026 With their messaging in regards to election 2024, it is absolutely about Ukraine policy,\u201d said Clint Watts, general manager of Microsoft\u2019s Threat Analysis Center.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMuch of the content, including fake videos, news articles or explosive claims from sources identifying as whistleblowers or citizen journalists, is initially seeded on Telegram, which Watts said has become a primary distribution channel for Russian propaganda efforts since the start of the Ukraine invasion.\n\nTwo groups in particular, tracked by Microsoft as Storm 1516 and Storm 1099, have relied on this approach, posting anti-Ukraine content on purpose-built Telegram channels that are then picked up by seemingly unaffiliated news outlets and websites with names like \u201cDC Weekly\u201d and \u201cMiami Chronicle\u201d that pose as local sources but are actually Russian cut-outs.\n\nStorm 1099 \u2014 otherwise known as Doppelganger \u2014 uses outlets that specifically target the United States, with names like \u201cElection Watch\u201d and \u201c50 States of Lie.\u201d These sites play up internal domestic divisions in U.S. society and politics, warning that \u201cAmerican elections have long since lost their democratic character\u201d and that the nation faces an \u201cunprecedented number of rebellions that could split the country in two.\u201d\n\nWatts said these Telegram channels function as \u201ca bridge by which [content] gets pushed into and reposted and amplified in social media, such that it moves from one social media platform to another.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s a marked change from eight years ago, when platforms like Facebook and Twitter had built up mass general audiences that allowed for direct targeting in influence campaigns. Today, audiences are far more fragmented across different social media, something that has led to Russian groups using Telegram as a staging ground for content that can be micro-targeted to different audiences on different platforms.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s assessment that Russian operatives are laser focused on influencing Ukraine policy is backed up by several other sources, including Mandiant, which found a Russian hacking group targeting political parties in Germany in an effort to gain insights into policymaking on Ukraine. Rob Joyce, the former director of cybersecurity at NSA, told reporters in March that \u201cRussia is very motivated to make sure that the focus on support to Ukraine is disrupted.\u201d\n\nRussia has been by far the most prolific actor in the election interference space this cycle, with Microsoft also tracking activity from China, Iran and other countries, but not at nearly the same cadence or intensity.\n\nMoscow\u2019s disinformation operations continue to leverage both online and offline methods to spread damaging narratives. A campaign collectively known as the NABU leaks was carried out by Andrii Derkach, a former Ukrainian member of Parliament, in the lead-up to the 2020 elections. Those efforts were meant to discredit the Ukrainian National Anticorruption Bureau and spread rumors of current and former U.S. officials engaged in corruption, money laundering and political influence in Ukrainian politics.\n\nDerkach, who was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department for the NABU leaks campaign, indicted in 2022 for efforts to covertly influence the 2020 election and stripped of his Ukrainian citizenship in 2023, had gone quiet since the start of the Ukraine invasion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, he reemerged in January in an interview with a Belarusian media personality, reviving claims from the NABU leaks and seeking to implicate Biden in Ukrainian corruption at the same time that House Republicans were pursuing an impeachment inquiry against the president under the auspices of similar corruption claims.\n\nA key witness in that inquiry, an American-Israeli citizen named Alexander Smirnov who had previously served as a confidential human source for the FBI, was indicted in February on charges of lying to the FBI about contacts between the Biden family and Ukrainian energy company Burisma. According to the indictment, Smirnov said in interviews with the FBI that the new information was gleaned from conversations with high-level Russian government officials.\n\nThere doesn\u2019t yet appear to be solid evidence of Russian activity setting up the kind of hack-and-leak campaign that upended the 2016 U.S. presidential race. But Watts said in order to properly prepare such a campaign, Russian hackers \u201cneed to be hitting targets in the next 60 days\u201d to leave enough time to leak content ahead of November.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s report was published on the same day the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure and Security Agency, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the FBI released joint guidance on foreign malign influence operations against critical and election infrastructure.\n\nThe guidance reinforced some aspects of the Microsoft report, such as identifying Russia, China and Iran as the most active players targeting U.S. elections and highlighting potential tactics, like voice cloning and the use of proxy media to deceive target audiences. Many of these same tactics, the agencies note, can also be leveraged by domestic disinformation actors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe agencies\u2019 guidance for mitigating such threats largely echo what some state and local officials have told CyberScoop they\u2019re already doing, including training election officials on the threats and capabilities of AI, embedding digital watermarking tools in official documents, using safe words to authenticate voice conversations and holding transparency sessions with the public and media on voting technology and administration.\n\nAI becomes another tool in the influence toolbox\n\nBoth Russia and China have been observed leveraging AI-generated media in their influence campaigns over the past year. Most notably, a Chinese group known as Spamouflage used the tools to pump out a steady stream of AI-generated memes and deepfake audio and video targeting different candidates and parties in the lead-up to elections in Taiwan.\n\nHowever, while there is evidence that foreign influence groups continue to experiment with incorporating the technology into their campaigns, so far the fear that fully generated deepfake videos will cause mass deception among voters \u201chas not borne out,\u201d according to Microsoft\u2019s findings.\n\nIn many cases, \u201caudiences gravitate toward and share disinformation\u201d that \u201cinvolve simple digital forgeries consistent with what influence actors over the last decade have regularly employed,\u201d the report stated, and such cheapfake content still regularly outpaces fully synthetic generative AI videos in terms of views and shares.\n\nOne area that does show promise is voice cloning \u2014 either to generate fake audio phone calls and messages or to overlay with authentic video footage. This tactic was used in the U.S., when a Democratic operative tied to the Dean Phillips presidential campaign used deepfake technology in January to impersonate Biden and target his supporters with messages urging them to stay away from the polls in the New Hampshire primary. Similar incidents have been observed in Slovakia and Taiwan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot surprisingly, Microsoft\u2019s research has found that the more familiar a person is to the general public, the less effective deepfakes tend to be. One scenario where such audio could be particularly effective is in personal or private settings, such as a phone call or direct message, where the target is isolated and more vulnerable to deception.\n\nThat echoes what several state election officials and election security experts have told CyberScoop in previous interviews.\n\nUpdated April 17, 2024: This article has been updated to include a description of newly released U.S. government guidance on how to secure election infrastructure.\n\nCorrected April 17, 2024: An earlier version of this article reported that Alexander Smirnov was indicted on charges of being a Russian agent, when he was in fact indicted for lying to the FBI.",

It was another stark warning ahead of European parliamentary elections in June that Russian digital propagandists and their proxies are intent upon\u2014and capable of\u2014swaying elections within the EU.\n\nThe contest for the Slovakian presidency might at first glance seem like a marginal spectacle. In the Central European country of just 5.4 million, the presidency has few powers, the most consequential being a veto over new legislation\u2014and even that can be overridden by the parliament with a simple majority. Yet for the past five years this post has been held by the progressive-minded environmental and human rights advocate Zuzana Caputova, who, when elected in 2019, many saw as a bright spot in Central and Eastern Europe, a region where populists have thrived. Perhaps her most important work\u2014and evidence of the enormity of the popular figure\u2019s decision not to run for reelection\u2014unfolded in the last six months. Despite her limited reach, Caputova acted as a check on Fico\u2019s three-party coalition, for example by challenging the government\u2019s overhaul of the criminal code.\n\nKorcok, a retired diplomat who was foreign minister from 2020 to 2022, would have been an able successor, observers said. And he entered the race in pole position after winning the first round of voting in March with 42.5 percent of the votes, compared to Pellegrini\u2019s 37 percent.\n\nBut a campaign featuring a barrage of pro-Russian disinformation could have been the lever that turned the result around so dramatically: Pellegrini captured around 53 percent, while Korcok trailed woefully with almost 47 percent. Russia\u2019s footprint was all over the election campaign, said Slovak observers, and, as it did in last year\u2019s parliamentary elections, Russia\u2019s machinations may well have swung the vote to its favored candidate.\n\n\u201cRussia\u2019s impact was immense and influential,\u201d said Eva Mihockova of the Bratislava-based think tank Slovak Foreign Policy Association. \u201cThe lies and ridiculous falsehoods on dubious websites and social media blasted Korcok as the candidate of war and a dangerous free-market liberal,\u201d she said. \u201cThe influence of Russia is obvious, even though there\u2019s no evidence yet that these media are actually paid by Moscow, although there is big suspicion that they are. They certainly take a line that reflects Russia\u2019s interests.\u201d Mihockova said that much of the disinformation comes indirectly through Slovak proxies rather than directly from Russia, in contrast to last year, when Slovakia expelled a Russian diplomat for meddling in the parliamentary campaign.\n\n\u201cSince the pandemic, the pro-Russia, conspiracy-theorizing, so-called alternative media have been and are instrumental in changing the political landscape here, as well as the language and culture,\u201d said Juliana Sokolova, a Slovak poet and philosopher. \u201cThey are listened to by lots of people and accepted as true.\u201d\n\nThe pro-Russian internet platforms and social media channels, said Slovak experts such as Dominika Hajdu of the Bratislava think tank Globsec, threw their support demonstratively behind Pellegrini after the first round. The websites\u2014such as Hlavne Spravy, ExtraPlus, InfoVojna, and others\u2014reiterated the Kremlin line pretty much verbatim, she said. Hlavne Spravy\u2019s Telegram account is rife with posts about LGBTQ perversion, Washington\u2019s aggressive foreign policies, NATO\u2019s expansionist aims, the NATO-U.S. bombing of Serbia in 1999, and of course the war in Ukraine itself: the oppression of the Russian minority in Ukraine, NATO hawkishness, and the far right in Ukrainian society and politics. Some of the Slovak websites\u2019 news bulletins simply copied, translated, and pasted articles from NewsFront, Hajdu said, referring to a Crimea-based disinformation and propaganda outlet that works with Russia\u2019s main security agency, the FSB.\n\nAccording to Gerulata Technologies, a Slovak start-up specializing in hybrid threats, the thicket of pro-Russian media is complex and intransparent. There are far-right, far-left, and populist politicians who spread pro-Russian propaganda out of conviction, it said, as well as disinformation media outlets that are sometimes directly connected to Russian interests and others, like the Slovak branch of NewsFront, that are Russian state-controlled trolls and proxies.\n\nThe analyst Michaela Ruzickova said in the two weeks before the vote, the pro-Russian narratives reached a crescendo. Even more so than in July last year, Ruzickova, working for the think tank Warsaw Institute, found that \u201cto achieve its goals, the Kremlin uses not only its own resources (embassies, spies, oligarchs), but also local actors who are willing to cooperate and spread Russian propaganda for various incentives.\u201d Ruzickova argued that \u201cthe multiplication of Russian influence in Slovakia is facilitated by domestic sympathizers and disinformation actors who willingly adopt the content of pro-Kremlin channels, as well as the official positions of the Russian military and political establishment. Slovak disinformation actors are thus deliberately helping Russia to legitimize its policies and discredit Ukraine, the West, and democratic and international institutions.\u201d\n\nThe most pronounced example of this was the way that, in the aftermath of the first-round vote, Slovakia\u2019s pro-Russia media outlets and proxies energetically perpetuated the disinformation that Korcok was the candidate of war who would reinstate military conscription and send Slovak soldiers to Ukraine to fight for Kyiv. They charged that Korcok was a U.S. and NATO puppet who put the interests of the EU and the Atlantic alliance above those of ordinary Slovaks. In fact, Korcok never said this, nor does the Slovak president have the power to send anyone to war. Fico joined in the cacophony of Russian tropes, calling Korcok a \u201cwarmonger.\u201d\n\nThere is evidence across Central Europe of Russia investing in disinformation channels much like the Slovak websites and illiberal right-wing parties. On March 27, the German magazine Der Spiegel and the Czech Den\u00edk N reported that politicians from Germany, France, Poland, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Hungary received payments from Voice of Europe, a portal owned by a pro-Russian Ukrainian oligarch, to spread Russian propaganda in advance of the European Parliament vote. The Czech government slapped sanctions on the platform for promoting Russian interests and covertly financing candidates for the European Parliament, which caused it to cease operations. Voice of Europe had more than 180,000 followers on Twitter/X, according to the BBC.\n\nMatus Kostolny, chief editor of Dennik N, finds it hard to explain the Slovaks\u2019 favorable opinion of Russia after the Soviet Union\u2019s 40 years of postwar occupation of Slovakia and the invasion of Ukraine\u2014in stark contrast to neighboring Czech Republic and Poland. But he underscored that the Russian propaganda in Slovakia has more voices than just \u201cfake journalists\u201d on the internet. \u201cSlovakia\u2019s politicians, particularly in the government parties, regularly mouth this language of Russia and repeat its topics and propaganda. This is more powerful than anything coming directly from Russia.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that Slovaks want to live in Russia, nor do these [pro-Russian] politicians want the Soviet Union back in Slovakia,\u201d Kostolny told Foreign Policy. \u201cBut they use it to attack their liberal opponents who have cracked down on the corruption and put their allies behind bars.\u201d The Slovak president, Kostolny noted, has the authority to appoint justices to the Constitutional Court and to issue pardons\u2014two critical levers for reversing the fight against corruption. Kostolny said he wouldn\u2019t be in the least bit surprised if Pellegrini begins pardoning some of the dozens of convicted figures from the ranks of the government parties.\n\nBut Slovakia\u2019s new rulers have shown that they will practice what they preach. After the Fico government took office last year, Fico cut off Slovakian military aid to Ukraine and then claimed earlier this year that Ukraine stood \u201ccompletely under the influence and control of the USA\u201d and is therefore \u201cnot an independent and sovereign country.\u201d\n\nSokolova said that another critical component to the wins by Fico\u2019s party and Pellegrini was the long arm of Orban. The ethnic Hungarians living in Slovakia compose about 8 percent of the population and vote in both Slovak and Hungarian elections. They vote overwhelmingly for Orban\u2019s Fidesz party and tend to chafe under the rule of Slovak nationalist politicos.\n\nBut Orban sees an alliance with Slovakia\u2019s populist government, which includes the ultranationalist Slovak National Party, as a better payoff than fighting rhetorical battles over bygone injustices. \u201cOrban mobilizing voters in southern Slovakia via his media for Pellegrini was absolutely decisive,\u201d said Sokolova, an ethnic Hungarian living in southern Slovakia. \u201cThe voter turnout [for Pellegrini] was massive in [ethnic] Hungarian towns.\u201d\n\nMihockova said the ethnic animosity between Slovaks and Hungarians has mostly evaporated in favor of other enmities. \u201cSlovakia\u2019s nationalists and autocrats found that you can win more voters with the hate figure favorites of the Orban regime\u2014such as Brussels, the U.S., and immigrants\u2014than with traditional ethnic nationalism,\u201d she told Foreign Policy. \u201cThe Slovak populists see Orban and Fidesz Hungary as a role model.\u201d And, as for Orban\u2019s about-face, \u201che needs partners,\u201d Mihockova said.\n\nNow, with Slovakia\u2019s populist president and government in place, he has one more partner in his crusade to flip the European Parliament and abandon Europe\u2019s defense of Ukraine.",

        "text": "Voters, fearful of World War III as Iran strikes Israel, will weigh foreign policy in 2024\nAmericans yet again had foreign affairs take over their TVs and cell phone screens after Iran launched a historic \u2013 and telegraphed \u2013 attack against Israel during the ongoing war in the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe U.S. helped repel a wave of 300 drones and missiles, but Iran\u2019s direct action has raised the country's blood pressure as President Joe Biden and a divided Congress look to respond without further escalating the Gaza Strip crisis amid other international conflicts.\n\nVoters, activists and foreign policy experts who spoke with USA TODAY said the nation becoming entangled in a larger global conflict is a source of concern.\n\nHowever, some also asserted the risk of greater international tension isn\u2019t at the forefront of what\u2019s on their minds as the 2024 election comes into focus. Their views square with a country that spent years trying to extract itself from the post-9/11 Iraq and Afghanistan wars and a Donald Trump presidency centered around an \"America First\" platform that embraced a more isolationist foreign policy.\n\nChance Barrett, a systems engineer in Orlando, said the weekend attack in the Middle East will indirectly be an issue for him given the likelihood of U.S. lawmakers reviving an aid package to assist Israel and other allies.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\n\"We're going to send billions of dollars that all of a sudden we have when people are not going to the doctor because it's super expensive; rent is ridiculous; inflation has come out to be just corporate greed and wages are stagnating,\" the 30-year-old registered Democrat said in an interview.\n\n\"It's like, man, you know, we got money for the wars but not for the poors.\"\n\nPamela Clark , a registered independent from Smyrna, Tennessee, said as a Christian she puts trust into God.\n\n\"I just don't think that American lives should have to police everybody,\" she said.\n\nThe 63-year-old retired saleswoman, however, does worry about the U.S. getting too involved overseas and how that could impact younger people, such as her grandson, who are still military age. She said foreign affairs aren't high on her list of issues. But Saturday's attack does make her think about who should be president.\n\n\"Biden is more objective than Trump is, and what I mean objective as I think he would be more diplomatic, not do anything rash,\" Clark said.\n\nThose who favor the former president, however, said they believe the presumptive Republican nominee's unpredictability should be seen as an asset that deters rival world leaders and also terrorists.\n\n\u201cI mean, it kind of sounds cocky, but I don't think anybody's to that point of wanting to mess with America like that again, like they did back in the 1940s,\u201d Landon Wadkins, a field engineer, from Mansfield, Louisiana, told USA TODAY.\n\nThe 37-year-old registered Republican said what's happening in other countries could always backfire, but that the U.S. would \"squash a bug\" if World War III occurred.\n\nIf these international wars turn into a referendum on the 2024 election, Wadkins said he believes that will favor Trump, who he said is better suited to deal with foreign affairs.\n\n\u201cIt comes with that cocky American attitude,\" he said. \"I know for majority of time it's not needed but for times like that (Trump) would be the guy that goes in and says, 'No, y'all need to stop it.' And I feel like people will listen to him in that regard.\"\n\nMost Americans think another world war likely\n\nPoll after poll asking voters what matters most to them in this year's presidential contest rank foreign affairs low, if at all.\n\nA Gallup survey last month found most Americans saying topics such as inflation, crime, illegal immigration and affordable health care are among the most important problems facing the country. Nothing about what's happening in other nations made the list.\n\nTodd Belt, a professor and political management program director at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., said voters rarely put foreign affairs at the top of their list unless too much U.S. \"blood and treasure\" is at stake.\n\n\"This seems to be an issue that may not be particularly important because American voters tend to have a short memory when it comes to foreign policy when they vote in November,\" he said.\n\nYet there are anxieties, as many rushed to social media to express worry about \"World War III\" in the aftermath of Iran's strike.\n\nA YouGov survey released in March found 61% of Americans believe another world war is either very or somewhat likely to happen within the next five to 10 years. And events beyond U.S. borders have a way of upending past presidential races.\n\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic brought a virus to U.S. shores that changed everything, including how Democrats and Republicans campaigned for office and then how millions participated in the 2020 election.\n\nRussia's meddling in the 2016 race, which included hacking American political party emails and misinformation aimed at voters, rankled that entire campaign; then President Barack Obama's reelection was tested in the fall of 2012 by the attacks on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya; and back all the way up to the 1980 presidential campaign, many historians assert how Iran capturing 53 American hostages left President Jimmy Carter in a bind for an entire year that helped buoy Ronald Reagan to the White House.\n\n\"The longer that we're involved in a foreign entanglement, the more of an effect it has,\" Belt said. \"Shorter conflicts generally help a sitting president, especially in terms of reelection. Longer conflicts can be more detrimental.\"\n\nThe ongoing strife stemming from Israel's war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip presents Biden with more challenges, particularly from the voluble activist left which has waged militant protests calling out the rising death toll.\n\nAn exclusive USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll released in March showed a growing sympathy to Palestinians, especially among Democrats. About 69% of voters in Biden's own party said they wanted him to do more to hold Israel accountable for improving humanitarian conditions in the Gaza Strip.\n\nAs USA TODAY reported earlier this month, prominent donors on his finance committee have said they are withholding support until the Biden administration pressures Israel to change how it is conducting the war.\n\n\"For Biden this has been a real difficult issue, especially with regard to Israel because the Democratic Party has split on it in a way that the party is not split on something like Ukraine,\" Belt said.\n\nGordon Sondland, a former ambassador to the European Union, said Saturday\u2019s attack reveals how much of a \"paper tiger\" Iran has become.\n\n\u201cI have never seen an attack of this magnitude that was so transparent and so telegraphed,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was almost as if the mullahs in Tehran said we have to hit you back in order to save face with our hardliners.\u201d\n\nSondland, who served under Trump, said the U.S. is \u201cstretched thin\u201d at the moment with helping Ukraine in its war against Russia and the potential turbulence with China focusing in on Taiwan. But rather than raising anxieties about a sprawling global war, the U.S. must soberly meet this moment by standing up to Iran.\n\n\u201cWe were not close to World War III, but what this should tell the average person is you have to stand up to a bully and you have to stand up to a bully not by being reactive,\" he said.\n\nU.S., Israel alliance is tested\n\nAs Congress renews a debate on a dual aid package for Israel and Ukraine, which Trump has expressed skepticism over, the debate over who is best suited to handle these crises continues in the rest of the country.\n\nEric Fingerhut, president and CEO of the Jewish Federations of North America, said Saturday\u2019s attack is a reminder of how indispensable the U.S. and other allies are when it comes to protecting Israel and its people.\n\n\u201cThe well-coordinated responses and the initiative taken\u2026 you can\u2019t imagine the gratitude those of us who love and care deeply about Israel, who have family and friends there, feel right now,\u201d he said.\n\nFingerhut, a former Ohio legislator whose organization represents 146 Jewish federations across the U.S. and Canada, said he hopes those who have reservations about the Israeli war against Hamas and its impact in Gaza, would be reminded that the conflict began after Hamas\u2019 brutal attacks that killed about 1,200 Israeli civilians on Oct. 7.\n\n\u201cThere has been concern that because of length and difficulty of Israel\u2019s war to defeat Hamas, some were losing sight of what caused the war in the first place,\u201d he said.\n\nOther Jewish leaders echoed how Biden did a good job in warning the public of the potential for an Iranian attack and helping repel the drones and missiles. Still, this past weekend\u2019s strikes revived uncomfortable memories.\n\n\u201cOn one level, it seems like the global community was prepared,\u201d Tyler Gregory, CEO of the Jewish Community Relations Council of the Bay Area, told USA TODAY.\n\n\u201cBut on the other, it felt like Oct. 7. There was a lot of anxiety and fear playing out, and for all of us who have loved ones there it was a very scary weekend that reminded us of the uncertainty of six months ago,\u201d he added.\n\nThe attack, he said, escalates the conflict and raises the potential for a miscalculation that could lead to global crisis. He compared it to the assassination of Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand, which sparked World War I in 1914.\n\n\u201cIf someone makes a wrong move, this tinderbox could go up into flames immediately,\u201d Gregory said. \u201cThat\u2019s why a lot of us are on edge. We can\u2019t be certain where this is going.\u201d\n\nAssal Rad, a Middle East historian and author of \u201cThe State of Resistance: Politics, Culture and Identity in Modern Iran,\u201d said the attack this past weekend hints at longtime fears among analysts that Israel\u2019s failure to heed international law and norms might escalate into something more serious.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one reason people have been calling for a ceasefire,\u201d she said. \u201cNot only for Palestinians and Gaza, but because of the fear that it could cause greater conflict. Now, we\u2019re really at the precipice. And as an American, I\u2019m very scared.\u201d\n\nBiden and Trump, she said, represent two failed foreign policy views that have already been on display for voters to gauge.\n\nBut Rad said even a third-party candidate, like American philosopher Cornel West, whose approach to domestic and foreign policy resonate with many progressives, has little chance in the current electoral system.\n\nIn Arizona, Paul Rockower, executive director of the Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Phoenix, said many in his part of the country were \u201cunderstandably anxious\u201d about the situation.\n\nBoth Rockower and Gregory said Jewish Americans will cast their November ballots based on a number of issues, such as supporting democratic norms, LGBTQ issues, reproductive rights and resisting domestic extremism.\n\nAt the same time, Gregory said, while Jewish people are part of the Democratic Party backbone, that vote should not be taken for granted this fall.\n\n\"If Israel is abandoned, that\u2019s going to be detrimental to the Democratic Party,\" he said.",

        "text": "As a Palestinian American, I can\u2019t vote for Joe Biden any more. And I am not alone\nAmerica is big, diverse and polarized. Yet, when it comes to the war in Gaza, opinions here are converging. A Gallup poll in March found 55% of respondents \u201cdisapprove of Israel\u2019s actions\u201d, up from 45% in November. Among registered Democrats, the figure is 75%. As the number of citizens voting \u201cuncommitted\u201d in Democratic primaries makes plain, President Biden\u2019s unqualified support for Israel is a problem. Beyond the human carnage \u2013 32,000 Palestinians, including over 14,000 children, have been killed by Israel in Gaza \u2013 Biden\u2019s Israel policy could cost him the election.\n\n\u201cWe have given Biden and his administration and the party a gift,\u201d said Layla Elabed, organizer of the Listen to Michigan campaign, where 100,000 voters marked the \u201cuncommitted\u201d box in February. The vote in Michigan, a battleground state where Biden beat Trump by a little more than 154,000 votes in 2020, has triggered a cascade of protest votes in primaries across the country. At least 25 uncommitted delegates will be sent to the Democratic national convention in August.\n\nElabed explained to me that these protest votes in swing states are meant to warn Biden that it\u2019s time to restrict US military aid to Israel and call for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza. \u201cListen to your constituency and take action now,\u201d she said, \u201cor you\u2019re going to have trouble in November.\u201d Notably, Elabed and the campaign she leads hope that the president may correct course and earn their vote, thereby preventing a second Trump term.\n\nProminent Democrats, Governor Gretchen Whitmer among them, have failed to engage with the substance of the argument and with the campaign\u2019s stated goals.\n\nPresident Biden ignores our voices at his own peril, and ours\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important not to lose sight of the fact that any vote that\u2019s not cast for Joe Biden supports a second Trump term,\u201d Whitmer announced ahead of the Michigan primary vote.\n\nWhitmer\u2019s argument that critics of the president\u2019s policy in Palestine, in effect, offer support to former president Trump seems designed to encourage voters to fall in line. Yet, as Judith Max Palmer, a Philadelphia voter and registered Democrat, said to me: \u201cThe Democrats think they can scare us into submission and people are tired of it.\u201d\n\nThe intraparty fight has taken Representative Rashida Tlaib of Michigan as its totem. As the only Palestinian American in Congress, she has used her sizable public platform to decry the \u201clevel of support for Netanyahu\u2019s war crimes by the Biden administration\u201d in commission of Israel\u2019s \u201cgenocide in Gaza\u201d. She also advised her constituents and others who are dismayed by the Biden policy to vote uncommitted in the primary. In doing so, she earned the opprobrium of other Democrats.\n\nDon Calloway, a Democratic strategist, railed against Tlaib.\n\n\u201cWhen Jalen Rose Leadership Academy and Wayne State and Cass Tech don\u2019t get the proper appropriations from the Democratic administration \u2026 remember it\u2019s because your Democratic congresswoman told them to not vote for the Democratic president in the primary,\u201d he said.\n\nCalloway\u2019s argument, which seems to prize party discipline over individual choice, is basically at odds with the tenets of participatory democracy. Voters are not beholden to a party \u2013 rather, the candidate is charged with crafting policies that appeal to an electorate to win votes. If voters in Biden\u2019s coalition are now advocating for a change in policy, that \u2013 as the protesters say \u2013 is what democracy looks like. The candidate, and not the voters, is to blame if he fails to win in November, a point the Democrats appear to have struggled to comprehend in the wake of Hillary Clinton\u2019s loss to Trump in 2016.\n\n\u201cThe cruelty [of Israel\u2019s campaign in Gaza] is beyond my worst imagination. It changes the calculus,\u201d said Rabbi Alissa Wise, another Philadelphia voter and one of the founders of Rabbis for a Ceasefire. She admitted to me that she worries Donald Trump \u201cwould be even more horrific\u201d as president, but she wants to concentrate on the value of a protest vote now: \u201cMy hope is that the uncommitted campaign could really scare [policymakers] into a conscience.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen \u2018The uncommitted campaign \u2013 citizens banding together to petition democratically, in good faith, for a change in government policy \u2013 is the greatest expression of what it means to live in a democracy.\u2019 Photograph: Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n\nUnlike Elabed and others I interviewed for this story, I have a different perspective.\n\nI am a Palestinian American in Pennsylvania, a contested state. I plan to write in \u201cuncommitted\u201d in the Democratic primary on 23 April and in November, I will vote for a third-party candidate.\n\nLike many Democrats, I was underwhelmed by the prospect of another Biden term, but I was prepared to move past my concerns about the president\u2019s age and cognitive fitness to support the broader agenda on climate, among other things. I reasoned that Biden is supported by a cadre of experts, and that his job is mostly to set priorities and enlist the best and brightest to fill in the gaps. Now I am no longer able to rationalize support for this administration; the president\u2019s moral failure in Gaza has taken on historic proportions, like Lyndon Johnson\u2019s in Vietnam before him.\n\nNor am I alone. \u201cThere\u2019s no way I can see myself supporting Biden in the next election,\u201d Will Youmans, associate professor of media and public affairs at George Washington University, told me. \u201cSupporting a genocide is the reddest of lines,\u201d he explained. In November, Youmans plans to vote for down-ballot Democrats, but he will write in a protest vote for president.\n\nFor Palestinians, the prospect of a second Trump administration is distressing, even if Representative Debbie Dingell\u2019s statement that Trump, were he president, might have \u201cnuked Gaza\u201d seems a little overheated. Jared Kushner, who advised Trump in his last administration, openly opined about \u201cvery valuable \u2026 waterfront property\u201d in Gaza as he described a vision of ethnic cleansing in the Strip.\n\nYet it\u2019s not clear that Trump\u2019s putative policies will be worse than Biden\u2019s current policies are. In reality, if Benjamin Netanyahu decides to invite Kushner and others to develop Jewish settlements in Gaza, there is no reason to believe Biden will stop him from doing so. The president, after all, has only mouthed his discontent with Israel\u2019s actions. That\u2019s even as he has actively armed the Israelis, who seem able to do whatever they please. Actions \u2013 for better or worse \u2013 speak more loudly than words do.\n\nNor is the question of who may be worse \u2013 measured against the lesser evil \u2013 sufficient to drive voter behavior on this issue. For many, myself included, a vote for Biden is simply impermissible \u2013 the extent of the moral calamity is so great as to render a vote for Biden a vote for complicity.\n\nOur values in this country \u2013 freedom of speech, enterprise, equality before the law \u2013 are unique among countries and are worth fighting for. In the best expression of America, our values are regarded as inviolable, and they provide a roadmap for our activism. This country is bigger than Trump or Biden and while elections matter, they only gain meaning as a way of expressing our values. We cannot be the source of arms that destroy the lives of millions of people. We cannot abet a famine.\n\nThe uncommitted campaign \u2013 citizens banding together to petition democratically, in good faith, for a change in government policy \u2013 is the greatest expression of what it means to live in a democracy. Tlaib, Elabed, Wise and other engaged Americans who have worked to move the president to adopt a humane policy in Palestine embody our best values. As the president of the Center City mosque in Philadelphia, Mohammed Shariff, said to me: \u201cMy vote is the purest form of expression and speech.\u201d President Biden ignores our voices at his own peril, and ours.",

        "text": "Iraq\u2019s dangerous balancing act between Iran and the US\nIraqi PM al-Sudani\u2019s visit to Washington. DC, came as its neighbour Iran attacked Israel, raising fears of regional conflict.\n\nFour days ago, Iraq\u2019s airspace had hundreds of projectiles fired from Iran flying through it towards Israel, caught in the crossfire of what many fear could be the opening salvoes of a regional war dragging in the United States.\n\nOn Monday, Iraq\u2019s Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani was in Washington, DC, meeting President Joe Biden and other top US officials \u2013 a preplanned trip that took on new importance for all involved.\n\nFrom the White House, al-Sudani addressed the uptick in tensions, saying he encouraged \u201call efforts to stop the expansion of the area of the conflict\u201d, highlighting his fears of being dragged into a regional war involving countries that continue to have a strong influence in Iraq.\n\nIraqi officials say their country was among a handful that Iran told of the attack \u2013 which followed an Israeli strike on the Iranian Embassy in Damascus that killed a senior Iranian general \u2013 in advance.\n\nRegional tensions aside, al-Sudani\u2019s primary focus appears to be Iraq\u2019s domestic concerns as he hopes to attract investment in Iraq\u2019s private sector and progress on a US troop withdrawal from the country, analysts told Al Jazeera.\n\n\u201c[Al-]Sudani\u2019s agenda is domestically oriented. He is seeking less American restrictions on the Iraqi banking system, more investments and enhancing security ties,\u201d Tamer Badawi, an Iraq analyst focusing on politics and security, said.\n\nAccording to Sajad Jiyad, a fellow at Century International and director of the Shia Politics Working Group, the meetings went well but the timing \u2013 so soon after Iran\u2019s attack \u2013 limited the outcome.\n\n\u201cI think the Iraqi side had higher expectations of what support and agreements they could reach but those were tempered by the events preceding the meeting,\u201d Jiyad told Al Jazeera.\n\n\u201cFor the US, the Iran-Israel clash served to highlight the need to keep US troops in Iraq for now and that the Iraqi government needs to do more to prevent Iran and groups allied with it from using Iraq as a base of operations against the US and Israel.\u201d\n\nTightrope walk over US presence\n\nMore than 20 years after the US invasion of Iraq in 2003 to remove former leader Saddam Hussein, 2,500 US troops are still based in the country, primarily in counter-ISIL (ISIS) roles.\n\nFor many Iraqis, who remember the deadly post-war period well, the US presence is not welcome. Al-Sudani has had to walk a tightrope between the US and placating parts of his domestic base.\n\nAnd for Iran-aligned groups, such as the militias that form the Islamic Resistance in Iraq (IRI), the US troops became a target starting October 18, in the wake of Israel\u2019s war on Gaza.\n\nHowever, after the US assassinated three senior figures in Kataib Hezbollah, the most powerful force in the IRI, in early February, the group announced it would suspend attacks on US troops.\n\nAs tensions rise in the region, Washington may view al-Sudani as a potential interlocutor with Iran.\n\nUS officials have repeatedly said they do not want to be dragged into a wider regional war and Iraq \u2013 while relatively quiet since February \u2013 has reason to fear Iran-aligned groups in the country remobilising if regional tensions expand.\n\n\u201cIraq\u2019s position is that it wants an end to hostilities in Gaza,\u201d Yesar Al-Maleki, a Gulf analyst at the Middle East Economic Survey (MEES), told Al Jazeera.\n\n\u201cIf Washington can manage to bring the war there to an end, it will no doubt aid Mr Sudani\u2019s efforts to spare Iraq the repercussions, whether security or economic, from a continued conflict.\u201d\n\nIraq is set to have elections in 2025 and the prime minister needs the support of his domestic backers as well as the US if he wants to renew his mandate.\n\n\u201cIf the PM returns from Washington with US support for his government, promises of a US troop reduction or a scheduled withdrawal sometime in the future, and relieving of US restrictions on Iraq\u2019s financial sector, these factors would support his position and even add to his public image,\u201d Al-Maleki said.\n\n\u201cHis visit to the White House is the first step towards building more trust to have American support for his appointment as prime minister after the next elections,\u201d Badawi added.\n\nFinding that balance has not always been easy, with al-Sudani pushed to call for a complete withdrawal of US troops in January, seemingly in response to some 53 US attacks on Iran-aligned groups in Iraq.\n\n\u201cIt is important for [al-]Sudani to sustain good relations with the US,\u201d Harith Hasan, a nonresident senior fellow at the Carnegie Middle East Center, told Al Jazeera. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to come off as anti-American or to portray the end of the occupation in bad faith.\u201d\n\nAnalysts said al-Sudani will want to show that his meetings in Washington, DC, brought progress on this issue and is under pressure to secure a troop withdrawal while maintaining US support in other areas.\n\nBut if he can reframe the US presence to show the two working as partners in a \u201cnew phase of engagement that is no longer restricted to security collaborations, it would be considered a win for [al-]Sudani\u201d, Nancy Ezzeddine, a research fellow at the Hague-based Clingendael Institute, told Al Jazeera.\n\nFinancial stressors\n\nIn addition to discussion on US troops, al-Sudani hopes to secure financial agreements in his DC meetings to ease the pressure on Iraq.\n\nIraq\u2019s economy is over-reliant on oil, which pulls in more than $100bn a year, with a bloated public sector where doing business is difficult and credit is hard to access, according to the International Labour Organization.\n\nThe revenue from Iraq\u2019s oil is held in an Iraqi government account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York but the US has restricted transfers to the Iraqi Ministry of Finance in recent months due to concerns over money laundering and the flow of US dollars to Iran.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a number of anti-money laundering policies that have come into play over the past few months by both the Americans and Iraqi government by curbing usage of US dollar transactions in a number of commercial banks and closing down the money traders,\u201d Ezzeddine said.\n\n\u201cThis has really shrunk the foreign currency supply in the country.\u201d\n\nIraq has taken steps to appease the US, including \u201csuspending the licences of some banks, pushing for documentation and auditing of dollar transactions, reducing cash transactions and limiting the amount of dollars that banks make available for withdrawals,\u201d Jiyad wrote in a Q&A with the Century Foundation, published on April 5.\n\nUS interests\n\nAs for the US, Biden will have both domestic and regional concerns for Iraq.\n\nOn the former, the US will be looking to nudge al-Sudani to cooperate with US allies in Erbil, the capital of the Kurdish region of northern Iraq.\n\nOver the past six months, members of the Kurdish region\u2019s government have made multiple trips to Washington in efforts to have the Biden administration act as mediators with Baghdad, with which it has had several disputes in recent years.\n\n\u201cThe delegation accompanying Sudani includes officials from the [Kurdish] Regional Government, which is a positive indicator of his relationship with the KRG,\u201d Sarhang Hamasaeed, the director of Middle East Programs at the US Institute of Peace, told Al Jazeera.\n\n\u201cThe Kurdish leaders generally view Sudani favourably and as genuine in trying to resolve Baghdad-Erbil issues.\u201d\n\n\u201cWashington wants to see Sudani enforcing Baghdad\u2019s financial commitments towards the Kurdistan Region consistently and sustainably and allow Erbil to export oil,\u201d Badawi said. \u201cThe Iraqi federal court\u2019s rulings have been increasingly perceived as \u2018politicised\u2019 by Erbil and its foreign allies.\u201d\n\nOne of these cases concerns a pipeline sending oil to Turkey from KRG-controlled territory in northern Iraq, which was shut down after the Iraqi federal government objected to the direct transfer of oil without its involvement, leading to the shutting down of the pipeline last year.\n\n\u201cThe opening of the pipeline has been delayed with no justification for over a year now,\u201d Ezzeddine said. \u201cThis relates not only to oil exports but also a number of other budgetary, legal and constitutional issues.\u201d\n\nRegionally, the Biden administration is looking to counter Iranian influence in Iraq.\n\n\u201cThe US would want commitments to guarantee Iraq\u2019s sovereignty by minimising Iranian influence across all levels of decision, including the politics, the economics and the security decision-making in Iran,\u201d Ezzeddine said.\n\n\u201cThe US president hopes to find in Sudani a partner who could contain pro-Iran factions, especially armed militias, in Iraq as the US gears into its presidential elections and Washington is more pressed than ever to de-escalate tensions in the Middle East,\u201d Al-Maleki said.\n\n\u201cSuccess would require compromises by both leaders.\u201d",

        "text": "Russia\u2019s 2024 Election Influence Campaign Has Started, Microsoft Analysis Finds\nTopline\n\nThe latest Russian-backed election influence campaign\u2014aided by some new AI-driven tactics\u2014is underway ahead of the 2024 presidential election, though it appears to have gotten off to a slower start than in past election cycles, according to a new report from Microsoft\u2019s Threat Analysis Center.\n\nTOPSHOT - A Russian rescuer speaks on his mobile phone next to a wall bearing an image of Russia's ... [+] President Vladimir Putin and Moscow's Kremlin at a polling station during local elections organised by the Russian-installed authorities in Donetsk, Russian-controlled Ukraine, on September 8, 2023. (Photo by STRINGER / AFP) (Photo by STRINGER/AFP via Getty Images) AFP via Getty Images\n\nKey Facts\n\nRussian election influence actors\u2014the same ones that have been identified in past campaigns\u2014have shown new signs of activity over the last 45 days, though their activity appears to be occurring at \u201ca slower tempo\u201d than observed ahead of the 2016 or 2020 presidential elections, which was likely due to a \u201cless contested\u201d primary season this year, Microsoft said. Russian influence efforts in this election cycle have focused heavily on turning U.S. opinion against Ukraine and NATO, with Microsoft\u2019s analysis finding at least 70 Russian actors using both traditional media and social media to spread Ukraine-related disinformation over the last two months. Microsoft has identified several Russia-affiliated actors behind the influence operations\u2014including the group Microsoft refers to as Storm 1099, which was responsible for the wide-reaching \u201cDoppelganger\u201d misinformation campaign in 2022. The \u201cmost prolific\u201d of these actors, however, are affiliated with the Russian Presidential Administration, which Microsoft says highlights \u201cthe increasingly centralized nature\u201d of these influence campaigns\u2014a shift away from the 2016 and 2020 campaigns that were more closely associated with Russia\u2019s so-called Internet Research Agency and intelligence services.\n\nHow Is Artificial Intelligence Affecting These Campaigns?\n\nArtificial intelligence is shaping how these influence actors operate\u2014though not as significantly as experts have long feared, and not in the ways that officials have expected. While the emergence of AI raised fears that so-called deepfake videos could be used to deceive and manipulate the public, Microsoft says such efforts have been largely unsuccessful, generally failing to fool audiences or gain traction. Instead, audiences have been more likely to fall for \u201csimple digital forgeries\u201d\u2014fake news stories with fake logos, for instance\u2014which influence actors have used for years. Microsoft says AI was more convincing when used to alter or enhance existing content than when used to generate content from scratch, and even then, AI-generated audio is generally more convincing than videos. The report also found that AI-generated content about lesser known figures was more likely to fool audiences than content about well-known figures.\n\nWhat To Watch For\n\nThese groups often follow similar tactics for circulating misinformation. One actor that Microsoft refers to as Storm-1516, for instance, typically introduces misinformation on video channels, purporting the source to be a whistleblower or independent journalist. The group then uses a network of websites it covertly operates to amplify the information, prompting it to be further picked up and, ultimately, deceive audiences.\n\nKey Background\n\nThe U.S. has long accused Russia of using social media and other online tools to try and influence U.S. politics and stoke division, particularly near election time. Those efforts first came to light in 2016, when Russian-sponsored entities were identified trying to sow discord and back then-candidate Donald Trump.\n\nContra\n\nRussia has long denied that it attempted to meddle in any U.S. election, and last month vowed it would not meddle in the 2024 election\u2014despite mounting evidence from U.S. cybersecurity experts and intelligence agencies. Forbes contacted the Russian embassy in Washington for comment on Microsoft\u2019s report but did not immediately hear back.\n\nFurther Reading",

        "text": "US construction demand could rise once election jitters subside\nThe uncertainty surrounding the election has had a chilling effect on major projects while developers wait to get a read on the future regulatory environment. Once a clear path is visible, steel should begin to flow to major projects \u2013 particularly government-funded infrastructure projects \u2013 that had been just sitting on the shelf, according to Fastmarkets research.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn 2023, the overall economy overcame an impending recession. Entering 2024, headwinds remain from supply chain and skilled labor market uncertainty and high energy and input prices,\u201d Felix Bello, Fastmarkets US steel analyst, said. \u201cBut it is the doldrums\u2019 uncertainty that the presidential election brings for 2024 that may make 2025 the year for steady tail winds.\u201d\n\n\n\nFastmarkets publishes a range of construction-focused steel prices, from its legacy domestic rebar offering to upcoming new import prices for 55% Al-Zn coated steel sheet, commonly used in roofing. Fastmarkets has been publishing the domestic Galvalume equivalent since June 2019. The new 55% Al-Zn coated import prices will go live on April 16.\n\nGains ahead for construction in 2024\n\nThe American Institute of Architects projects construction sector spending in 2024 to increase by 6% overall, with a 3% increase for commercial, 15% for industrial, and 4% for institutional buildings, Bello said. It\u2019s billings index stood at 46.2 in January, however, \u201cindicating a tepid decline in business conditions,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs such, it may be a further indicator of normalizing demand that may give impetus to rising activity once inflation and interest rates recede, and investment billions from the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS and Science Act flow through the economy,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nA steel trader echoed the sentiment.\n\n\n\n\u201cOverall, election years can introduce uncertainty and fluctuations in demand for steel,\u201d they said. \u201cThe specific impact will depend on the interplay of various factors including policy decisions, economic conditions and global market dynamics. Historically, as I remember, during the presidential elections\u2019 start to the actual election day, construction normally slows down the growth rate.\u201d\n\n\n\nBeyond policy, the trader added that elections tend to cloud consumer confidence. Clarity following the election usually entails an uptick in sentiment, they said.\n\n\n\n\u201cPositive sentiment may lead to increased investment and construction activity, driving up demand for steel. Conversely, uncertainty or negative sentiment may result in reduced spending and lower demand for steel products,\u201d they said.\n\nThis week, Fastmarkets has launched an import component to our domestic Galvalume price. Talk to us today to find out more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here.\n\nNew York CNN \u2014\n\nAmerica\u2019s right-wing forces would have you believe that they are the courageous entities standing up for free speech.\n\nBut, as they try to claim that mantle, many of those same forces in media and politics are behind a disturbing wave of book bans sweeping the nation.\n\nPEN America, a non-profit organization committed to protecting free expression, published an alarming report Tuesday indicating that the \u201cbook ban crisis\u201d is only getting worse. The bans are \u201cspeeding up,\u201d the organization warned in its report, a troublesome trend that is impacting public school systems from coast-to-coast.\n\n\u201cThere were over 4,000 instances of book bans in the first half of this school year\u2014more than all of last school year as a whole. This is a marked increase in comparison to the last spring semester, in which PEN America recorded 1,841 book bans,\u201d the group said in the report, aptly titled \u201cBanned in the USA.\u201d\n\nThe bans started in haste in early 2021, birthed in the backlash to Nikole Hannah-Jones\u2019s 1619 Project at The New York Times. At the time, the concern among conservatives was that schools were using books to supposedly indoctrinate young students with critical race theory, an academic concept that became a culture war flashpoint and sparked hysteria in right-wing circles. Over time, the bans have grown to encompass other topics, notably gender ideology.\n\nThe censorship has been fueled by the right-wing media machine (which again, purports to be pro-free speech), with entities such as \u201cLibs of TikTok\u201d targeting specific school systems and effectively waging pressure campaigns against administrators to take certain works off the library shelves.\n\nSome of the books removed from schools across the country include Margaret Atwood\u2019s acclaimed dystopian-novel-turned-Hulu-adaptation \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d Amy Reed\u2019s novel \u201cThe Nowhere Girls,\u201d Rupi Kaur\u2019s NYT bestseller \u201cMilk and Honey,\u201d Ta-Nehisi Coates\u2019s memoir \u201cBetween the World and Me\u201d and others.\n\n\u201cThose who want to ban books are attempting to use obscenity law and hyperbolic rhetoric about \u2018porn in schools\u2019 to justify banning books about sexual violence and LGBTQ+ topics (and in particular, trans identities). In doing so, they have also disproportionately targeted books by women and nonbinary authors,\u201d PEN America said. \u201cThe movement to ban books also continues to focus on themes of race and racism by advancing rhetoric disparaging \u2018critical race theory,\u2019 \u2018woke ideology,\u2019 and efforts to ensure library collections are diverse and inclusive.\u201d\n\nBanned books are visible at the Central Library, a branch of the Brooklyn Public Library system, in New York City on Thursday, July 7, 2022. Ted Shaffrey/AP\n\nSuch brazen book bans \u2014 unprecedented in modern American history \u2014 is at its worst in the red states of Florida and Texas. In Florida, where Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a law last year that led to the removal of books from public school shelves, more than 5,100 books were banned between July 2021 and December 2023, according to PEN America. In Texas, the number was more than 1,500, the group said.\n\nThe bans have also led to harassment against the authors who suddenly find themselves hurled into the information wars. Abdi Nazemian, a gay Iranian-American author, said during a press call organized by PEN America on Tuesday that \u201cnothing could have prepared\u201d him for \u201cthe experience of having my book banned.\u201d\n\n\u201cFirst and foremost, a heartbreak over the message it sends to young queer kids who deserve love and support. But also just the fear over all the online threats I\u2019ve received,\u201d Nazemian said. \u201cI\u2019ve been called a pedophile and a groomer. I\u2019ve been called filthy, indecent, profane, shady, slimy.\u201d\n\nPEN America said Tuesday that there is one glimmer of hope: growing resistance to the bans. Every major publisher is now actively supporting a legal case to halt book banning in Iowa. And, across the country, ordinary people are getting involved to put an end to the trend.\n\n\u201cWe see students at the forefront, leading protests, read-ins, marching to oppose censorship and educational censorship in particular happening and plaguing their schools and school libraries,\u201d Kasey Meehan, the program director of PEN America\u2019s Freedom to Read, said Tuesday. \u201cAnd, of course, we\u2019re joined by incredible voices of authors and parents and other advocates that are leading efforts to be as coordinated, as well resourced, and as organized as those efforts to remove books in the first place.\u201d",

        "text": "Abortion and the 2024 election: There is no easy way out for Republicans\nIn each instance (and there will be more) we find Republicans desperately trying to find a position on the issue that makes their base and the other parts of their coalition happy.\n\nRepublicans are thrashing around trying to get themselves out of the abortion ban they have tried to win for so many decades. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) was the first. In the fall of 2022, just months after the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade, he proposed legislation calling for a national abortion ban after 15 weeks. So far, this bill has gone nowhere. Then, in 2023, gubernatorial candidate Glenn Youngkin of Virginia put the 15-week abortion ban at the center of his campaign to help the GOP take full control of the Virginia legislature. Rather than holding one house and picking up the other, he lost both. Recently, former President Donald Trump\u2014who often brags about appointing the three Supreme Court justices who made possible the repeal of Roe v. Wade\u2014offered his own way out of the thicket by applauding the fact that states now can decide the issue for themselves. And in Arizona, the Republican Senate candidate, Kari Lake, is trying to rally the party around the notion of a 15-week ban instead of the 1864 near total ban their court just affirmed, even though she\u2019s facing criticism for this on the far right. Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal came out with a poll showing that abortion was the number one issue\u2014by far\u2014for suburban women voters in swing states.\n\nSince 2022, when the Supreme Court eviscerated Roe in the Dobbs case, we have been undergoing a reluctant national seminar in obstetrics and gynecology. All over the country, legislators\u2014mostly male\u2014are discovering that pregnancy is not simple. Pregnancies go wrong for many reasons, and when they do, the fetus needs to be removed. One of the first to discover this reality was Republican State Representative Neal Collins of South Carolina. He was brought to tears by the story of a South Carolina woman whose water broke just after 15 weeks of pregnancy. Obstetrics lesson #1\u2014a fetus can\u2019t live after the water breaks. But \u201clawyers advised doctors that they could not remove the fetus, despite that being the recommended medical course of action.\u201d And so, the woman was sent home to miscarry on her own, putting her at risk of losing her uterus and/or getting blood poisoning.\n\nA woman from Austin, Texas had a similar story\u2014one that eventually made its way into a heart-wrenching ad by the Biden campaign. Amanda Zurawski was 18 weeks pregnant when her water broke. Rather than remove the fetus, doctors in Texas sent her home where she miscarried\u2014and developed blood poisoning (sepsis) so severe that she may never get pregnant again. Note that in both cases the medical emergency happened after 15 weeks\u2014late miscarriages are more likely to have serious medical effects than early ones. The 15-week idea, popular among Republicans seeking a way out of their quagmire, doesn\u2019t conform to medical reality.\n\nOver in Arkansas, a Republican state representative learned that his niece was carrying a fetus who lacked a vital organ, meaning that it would never develop normally and either die in utero or right after birth. Obstetrics lesson #2\u2014severe fetal abnormalities happen. He changed his position on the Arkansas law saying, \u201cWho are we to sit in judgment of these women making a decision between them and their physician and their God above?\u201d\n\nIn a case that gained national attention, Kate Cox, a Texas mother of two, was pregnant with her third child when the fetus was diagnosed with a rare condition called Trisomy 18, which usually ends in miscarriage or in the immediate death of the baby. Continuing this doomed pregnancy put Cox at risk of uterine rupture and would make it difficult to carry another child. Obstetrics lesson #3\u2014continuing to carry a doomed pregnancy can jeopardize future pregnancies. And yet the Texas Attorney General blocked an abortion for Cox and threatened to prosecute anyone who took care of her, and the Texas Supreme Court ruled that her condition did not meet the statutory exception for \u201clife-threatening physical condition.\u201d\n\nSo, she and her husband eventually went to New Mexico for the abortion.\n\nObstetrics lesson #4\u2014miscarriages are very common, affecting approximately 30% of pregnancies. While many pass without much drama and women heal on their own\u2014others cause complications that require what\u2019s known as a D&C for dilation and curettage. This involves scraping bits of pregnancy tissue out of the uterus to avoid infection. When Christina Zielke of Maryland was told that her fetus had no heartbeat, she opted to wait to miscarry naturally.\n\nWhile waiting, she and her husband traveled to Ohio for a wedding where she began to bleed so heavily that they had to go to an emergency room. A D&C would have stopped the bleeding, but in Ohio, doctors worried that they would be criminally charged under the new abortion laws and sent her home in spite of the fact that she was still bleeding heavily and in spite of the fact that doctors in Maryland had confirmed that her fetus had no heartbeat. Eventually her blood pressure dropped, and she passed out from loss of blood and returned to the hospital where a D&C finally stopped the bleeding.\n\nThese are but a few of the horror stories that will continue to mount in states with partial or total bans on abortion. As these stories accumulate, the issue will continue to have political punch. We have already seen the victory of pro-choice referenda in deep red conservative states like Kansas, Kentucky, Montana, and Ohio; and in swing states like Michigan and in deep blue states like California and Vermont. In an era where almost everything is viewed through a partisan lens, abortion rights transcend partisanship.\n\nAnd more referenda are coming in November. The expectation is that at least some, if not most, of the pro-choice voters likely to be mobilized by the abortion issue will help Democrats up and down the ballot. As a result, Democratic campaigns are working hard to make sure the public knows that Republicans are responsible. The following table shows the states that are likely to have referenda in November. States where the referenda are already on the ballot are at the end of the table. Once the deadline occurs for filing signatures, a battle will take place in each state as pro-life groups seek to challenge enough signatures to keep the referenda from getting on the ballot, which is why pro-choice groups are gathering many more signatures than needed.",

        "text": "US reimposes oil sanctions against Venezuela over election concerns\nMove in US election year could push up oil prices, but Washington says Maduro has not made promised electoral reforms.\n\nUS reimposes sanctions on Venezuela\u2019s oil and gas sectors over election concerns\n\nThe United States is reimposing sanctions on Venezuela\u2019s vital oil sector over what it says is the government\u2019s failure to adhere to democratic principles ahead of elections in July.\n\nThe administration of US President Joe Biden said it would not renew a licence that expired early on Thursday, and which had partially eased the punitive measures since October after a US-backed election deal was reached between the government and the Venezuelan opposition in Barbados.\n\n\u201c[Venezuela\u2019s President] Nicolas Maduro and his representatives have not fully met the commitments made under the electoral roadmap agreement,\u201d said US Department of State spokesperson Matthew Miller.\n\n\u201cTherefore, General License 44 \u2013 which authorised transactions related to the oil and gas sector with Venezuela \u2013 will expire after midnight and not be renewed.\u201d\n\nAs the clock ticked down on the deadline, the US Treasury Department announced on Wednesday that it had issued a replacement licence giving companies 45 days to \u201cwind down\u201d their business and transactions in the OPEC country\u2019s oil and gas sector.\n\nNicolas Maduro and his representatives have not fully met the commitments made under the electoral roadmap agreement. Therefore, General License 44\u2014which authorized transactions related to the oil and gas sector with Venezuela\u2014will expire after midnight and not be renewed. \u2014 Matthew Miller (@StateDeptSpox) April 17, 2024\n\n\u201cWe are concerned that Maduro and his representatives prevented the democratic opposition from registering the candidate of their choice, harassed and intimidated political opponents, and unjustly detained numerous political actors and members of civil society,\u201d Miller added.\n\nThe government has barred several key political opponents from participating in the July 28 presidential race, despite agreeing with the opposition last October to hold a free and fair vote.\n\nGeneral License 44 broadly authorised oil and gas transactions with Venezuela\u2019s state-owned oil company PDVSA. It was introduced by the US after the government agreed to reforms that would bring more competitive elections with international observers.\n\nThe reimposition of sanctions means that Venezuela\u2019s fuel sales are expected to take a major hit, while US oil companies operating in Venezuela will have to scramble to seek special authorisations.\n\nIf the US does not grant enough individual authorisations, PDVSA is expected to resort to little-known intermediaries to sell its oil under price discounts, mainly to Asia.\n\n\u201cWe are open [for business], willing to keep progressing along with all foreign companies that want to come,\u201d Venezuela\u2019s Petroleum Minister Pedro Tellechea told reporters after the US announcement.\n\n\u201cVenezuela is ready to secure the stability of global oil markets that we need so much.\u201d\n\nEconomic blowback for the US\n\nWhile hitting the Venezuelan economy, the US sanctions also carry risks for Biden as he runs for re-election since they could result in a jump in domestic oil prices or pressure from Venezuela\u2019s government leveraging its migration policy.\n\nVenezuela has previously warned it would cancel migrant repatriation flights for Venezuelans, hundreds of thousands of whom have crossed into the US in recent years, if Washington continued with its \u201ceconomic aggression\u201d.\n\nThe October 2023 agreement collapsed after state institutions loyal to the government disqualified Maduro\u2019s main challenger, Maria Corina Machado, from running.\n\nMachado said the reimposition of sanctions was the result of \u201ca brutal wave of repression\u201d.\n\nMaduro, the successor of the late Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez, is seeking a third six-year term after 11 years in office marked by sanctions, economic collapse and accusations of widespread repression.\n\nDozens of countries, including the US, rejected the results of the 2018 elections that were won by Maduro and boycotted by the opposition.\n\nBut years of sanctions and other pressure failed to dislodge Maduro, who enjoys support from a political patronage system, the military and from Cuba, Russia and China.",

        "text": "Kaushik Rajashekara Elected International Fellow of the Engineering Academy of Japan\nKaushik Rajashekara, Distinguished Professor of Engineering at the University of Houston Cullen College of Engineering, continues to receive recognition and awards on a global scale. The man who ushered in the era of electric cars, working on the General Motors EV1 in 1995 when he was a Technical Fellow there, has been elected an International Fellow of the Engineering Academy of Japan, recognized for his contributions to power conversion and, of course, electrification of transportation.\n\nKaushik Rajashekara with the first GM electric car, the EV1, in 1995\n\nAccording to the academy, Rajashekara\u2019s election as an International Fellow specifically honors his \u201coutstanding scientific research and scientific-technical developments in the field of energy which promote greater efficiency and environmental security for energy sources on Earth in the interests of all mankind.\u201d\n\nHe stands among an elite group of fewer than 10 Fellows from the United States, out of a distinguished group comprising 800 Fellows and 15 International Fellows.\n\n\u201cI am deeply honored to have been chosen as an International Fellow of the Engineering Academy of Japan, a distinction that I hold in high regard. This recognition reflects the longstanding relationships I've cultivated with several esteemed Japanese universities and industries throughout my career,\u201d said Rajashekara, who is also the director of the UH power program PEMSEC (Power Electronics, Microgrids & Subsea Electrical Systems Center).\n\nOriginally from a small village in India, Rajashekara has kept Asia close; he is also an International Fellow of the Chinese and Indian National Academies of Engineering.\n\nKaushik Rajashekara today, a noted pioneer in electric transportation and a self-described \"futurist\"\n\nFor over three decades he has worked with Japanese students, engineers and the faculty of several Japanese universities. As the former lead propulsion system engineer for General Motors\u2019 IMPACT electric vehicle and as chief technologist at Rolls-Royce Corporation, he visited Japan often to give seminars at Meiji University among others. He has also visited companies like Toshiba, Fuji, Meidensha, Hitachi and more to establish research and development cooperation.\n\nHis reach is wide, his journey impressive. As a youngster who had to read by kerosine lamplight in a one room lean-to with his family of five, his accomplishments are nothing short of awe inspiring.\n\nIn 2022 Rajashekara received the most coveted prize in the field of international energy \u2013 the Global Energy Prize bestowed by the Global Energy Association. Only three people in the world were selected in 2022 for the honor out of a record 119 nominations from 43 countries. Think Nobel Prize for science or Academy Award for film. That\u2019s the level of the award. He is also a member of U.S. National Academy of Engineering and a Fellow of: The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, The National Academy of Inventors and The Society of Automotive Engineers.\n\nNaturally.\n\nIn fact, as a self-described \u201cfuturist,\u201d Rajashekara is confident that flying cars are the next big thing. Given his track record, we'll soon be arguing over who gets the top floor of the sky garage.",

Utah News Dispatch: Governor Spencer Cox urged voters to support the results of the presidential election . Cox: \"There really are things that can do to alter the trajectory of the United States\"",
        "text": "Utah governor\u2019s TED Talk urges U.S. to resist hate, tribalism as presidential election looms \u2022 Utah News Dispatch\nUtah Gov. Spencer Cox opened his TED talk, which he delivered from Canada on Wednesday, with a quote from former President Ronald Reagan: \u201cFreedom is a fragile thing, and it\u2019s never more than one generation away from extinction.\u201d\n\nCox said he, like many others, has used that quote many times \u2014 but he confessed he didn\u2019t actually believe it. That is, until the \u201cfirst cracks in my confidence came\u201d when he was Utah\u2019s lieutenant governor, and that was when he showed up to what was supposed to be a routine meeting to certify the votes of electors for a presidential election.\n\n\u201cI was stunned to see dozens of angry protesters screaming that the election had been stolen and demanding that we violate state law and change the votes of the electors,\u201d Cox told the audience members at the Vancouver Convention Centre, where his talk was live streamed on TED\u2019s website as part of a series of talks titled \u201cBridge-Builders.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, I know what you\u2019re all thinking, and you\u2019re probably wrong,\u201d Cox said. \u201cThis was not 2020. This was 2016. And the protesters were Hillary Clinton supporters.\u201d\n\nHowever, Cox said election protests \u201cgot far worse, somehow, four years later,\u201d referring to the 2020 presidential contest between then-President Donald Trump and Joe Biden. It was then, \u201cafter a summer of destructive protests by the extreme left and extreme right that was already undermining the validity of an election that hadn\u2019t even happened yet,\u201d that Cox said he decided to try something new.\n\nCox, at the time the Republican candidate for governor, said he called up his Democratic opponent Chris Peterson and pitched a \u201ccrazy idea: what if we filmed a campaign ad together?\u201d\n\n\u201cI could almost hear the confused look forming on his face,\u201d Cox said, to laughs. \u201cTo his credit, he agreed, and one week later we were in a studio together.\u201d\n\nThe result was an ad in which Peterson and Cox stood side by side to give Utahns a message they called \u201ccritical to the health of our nation.\u201d They urged voters, regardless of political affiliation or the outcome of the election, to support the results of the presidential election. Cox said in the ad they\u2019re \u201cboth committed to American civility and a peaceful transition of power.\u201d\n\nSome dismissed the joint ad as one that would only appear in a state where one candidate was all but sure to win (Utah is bright red and hasn\u2019t seen a Democratic governor since the \u201980s). However, the ad went viral and made national headlines.\n\nCox recalled thinking at the time that the ad and its response perhaps showed \u201cthere really is an exhausted majority\u201d fed up with polarized rhetoric and \u201cmaybe this is the message they want to hear.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe popularity of the ad validated my hope that most people really do want their political leaders to uphold the values that we teach our kids,\u201d Cox said. \u201cThat we can disagree without hate and contempt. That we can find ways to treat each other with respect, even when we disagree.\u201d\n\nCox said there seemed to be \u201ca hunger for architects instead of arsonists.\u201d\n\nThat hunch, he said, was confirmed when a professor submitted a version of the ad to the Stanford Polarization and Social Change Lab as part of a depolarization experiment. Out of 25 interventions tested on 31,000 people, the experiment found the Cox-Peterson ad was one of the most effective, ranking No. 2 for reducing support of partisan violence and No. 4 for reducing support for undemocratic practices, according to the experiment\u2019s results.\n\n\u201cIt turns out, there really are things that we can do to alter the trajectory of the United States,\u201d Cox said.\n\nWith a repeat contest between Trump and Biden looming this November, Cox acknowledged it\u2019s \u201ceasy to feel a little hopeless as Americans once again barrel towards an election with unsatisfying candidates and campaigns.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut there is good news,\u201d he said. \u201cOver the past six months, 20 governors from all across the country have filmed similar ads, most of them with a public servant from the opposing party.\u201d\n\nLet us know what you think...\n\nCox, who is currently serving as the National Governors Association\u2019s chairman, was alluding to videos created by his \u201cDisagree Better\u201d campaign, aimed at reducing hyperpartisanship and polarization across the U.S.\n\nCox said there are \u201cvery practical things that every one of us can do every day to help heal the divides in our nations and our neighborhoods.\u201d\n\nCox said Americans start by \u201cturning off and tuning out some of those conflict entrepreneurs,\u201d pointing first to cable news. He said studies have shown more time spent \u201cdoom scrolling\u201d is \u201creally bad for our mental health.\u201d He also said engaging in volunteering or service projects can help build communities and improve outlook on life.\n\n\u201cYou see, more news all the time isn\u2019t making us smarter, it\u2019s just stressing us out,\u201d Cox said. \u201cSecond, we can spend more time, preferably offline, with real people who are different from us. \u2026 You see, it\u2019s just harder to hate up close.\u201d\n\nCox said asking someone with opposing views \u201c\u2018tell me more about why you feel that way\u2019 is a magical request.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we look beyond our political tribes, we can actually find shared identities and friendships that unite instead of divide,\u201d Cox said.\n\nCox acknowledged that it\u2019s \u201calmost laughable to talk about words like humility in political discourse, but I truly believe that it is the only way for us to remember how to disagree without hate and contempt.\u201d\n\nCox closed with a call to action \u2014 for everyday people to \u201conce again secure the freedoms endowed to all of us from on high.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe cannot wait for politicians or the media to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will take real work, hard work, by each of us.\u201d\n\nThe solemn talk took a humorous turn when Cox briefly misspoke, drawing laughs from the crowd. \u201cWe must remember how to hate \u2014 how to disagree without hate,\u201d Cox said, quickly correcting himself with a laugh of his own. \u201cWe must remember how to disagree without hate. We must rise up and meet that radical call to love our enemies, even \u2014 especially our political opponents.\u201d\n\nCox concluded with what he said is not \u201can easy answer. But it is a simple one.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we really want to change the world, we have to start by changing our own hearts.\u201d",

        "text": "Justice Department Launches Updated Voting Rights and Elections Website\nThe Justice Department announced today that it has updated www.justice.gov/voting, a one-stop resource providing voting and elections information for voters as well as state and local elections officials. As part of the update, the Civil Rights Division published two new informational guides on voting rights and updated five other guides. The Department\u2019s longstanding practice is to update resources and provide information in election years on the efforts of the Civil Rights Division, Criminal Division, National Security Division, and U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices throughout the country, to ensure that all qualified voters have the opportunity to cast their ballots and have their votes counted free of discrimination, intimidation, or criminal activity in the election process, and to ensure that our elections are secure and free from foreign malign influence and interference. Over the coming months additional resources will be published.\n\n\u201cThe right to vote is the cornerstone of our democracy, the right from which all others flow,\u201d said Attorney General Merrick Garland. \u201cThe Justice Department is using every available authority to defend that right, both from efforts to undermine voting rights and from efforts to threaten and intimidate those who administer our elections. These updated resources will help voters understand their rights and assist public officials in fulfilling their duties.\u201d\n\n\u201cProtecting the right to vote is one of the Justice Department\u2019s highest priorities,\u201d said Acting Associate Attorney General Benjamin C. Mizer. \u201cToday, the Department is issuing new guidance documents, updating others, and updating our main voting website to make available in one place the resources the Department offers on voting rights \u2014 from a guide on the laws governing voting-related language assistance to a video explaining the protections against voter intimidation. We hope that these resources will make it easier for voters to exercise their rights and to enlist our help whenever and wherever those rights are under attack.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Justice Department works every day to defend the right of every eligible American to exercise their voice in our democracy,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division. \u201cThe new guides and updates we issue today, alongside our litigation, friend-of-the-court-briefs, and monitoring efforts demonstrate our commitment to using every tool available to protect the right to vote. These materials apprise voters about the protections provided by the Voting Rights Act and other civil rights laws and encourage voters to report violations. These resources also help state and local authorities comply with their obligations under the law.\u201d\n\nThe new guides issued today include one on Voter Intimidation Under Federal Law, discussing the prohibition on threats, obstruction, or deliberately false information about the time, manner, or place of voting to prevent people from casting their ballots or participating in the electoral process. The Department has prepared a short video explaining how to report such misconduct.\n\nThe second new guide addresses Voting Protections for Language Minority Citizens under Section 203 of the Voting Rights Act. Section 203 mandates language assistance to enable certain people with limited English proficiency to participate effectively in all phases of the electoral process.\n\nAlong with the two new guides, the Department updated five existing guides on the Justice Department website. The Department updated its guide on The Americans with Disabilities Act and Other Federal Laws Protecting the Rights of Voters with Disabilities. This guide describes the legal protections designed to allow equal access to every aspect of elections, including registration and voting, for people with disabilities. The Department also revised its Guidance Under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act for redistricting and methods of electing government bodies. Another update addressed Federal Law Constraints on Post-Election \u201cAudits.\u201d In addition, the Department updated its Guidance Concerning Federal Statutes Affecting Methods of Voting. Along with these revisions, the Department updated information on how to request Federal Election Monitors in a jurisdiction.\n\nThese guides on voting laws are just a few of the many resources the Department has made available on its website to help people exercise this foundational right and to assist public officials in fulfilling their duties. Other such resources include a brochure entitled Know Your Voting Rights, a 50-state Guide to State Voting Rules that Apply After a Criminal Conviction, explanations of the rights of voters with disabilities, including guides on Ballot Drop Box Accessibility, Solutions for Five Common ADA Access Problems at Polling Places, and How to File an ADA Complaint, and web pages addressing the voting rights of members of the armed services and U.S. citizens living overseas, the National Voter Registration Act, and the Help America Vote Act.\n\nThe www.justice.gov/voting website also provides information on the Department\u2019s Election Threats Task Force, which leads the Department\u2019s efforts to address violence against election workers and to ensure that all election workers \u2014 whether elected, appointed, or volunteer \u2014 are able to do their jobs free from threats and intimidation.\n\nYou can report suspected criminal activity regarding voting to the FBI at 1-800-CALL-FBI (1-800-225-5324) or by filing an online complaint at tips.fbi.gov. You can also contact local law enforcement. You can report possible civil rights violations at www.civilrights.justice.gov/report/ or 1-800-253-3931.\n\nIf at any time you are in imminent danger, call 911.",

        "text": "Experts react: The US just reimposed sanctions on Venezuela. What does this mean for energy markets and Venezuela\u2019s election?\nFrom Barbados to the ballot box, things got bumpy. On Wednesday, the United States announced plans to reimpose oil sanctions on Venezuela\u2014though with opportunities for exemptions\u2014faulting Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s government for failing to uphold an agreement signed in Barbados in October 2023. The agreement was intended to put Venezuela on the path to holding a competitive presidential election in 2024, but Maduro\u2019s government has cracked down on its political opponents ahead of the July 28 vote, including banning leading opposition candidate Mar\u00eda Corina Machado. Companies now have until the end of May to apply to the US Treasury for an individual license or wind down their business with Venezuela, most notably with state-run oil company Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela S.A., or PDVSA. So where does this leave Venezuelan politics and global oil markets? Our experts share their insights below.\n\nClick to jump to an expert analysis:\n\nJason Marczak: The US must ensure sanctions carve outs benefit the Venezuelan people, not just elites\n\nGeoff Ramsey: The US balances democracy promotion with a \u2018complex geopolitical reality\u2019\n\nDavid Goldwyn: The US is seeking a Goldilocks solution to sanctions on Venezuela\n\nEllen Wald: With US sanctions waivers withdrawn, expect China to dominate Venezuela\u2019s oil exports\n\nJesse Sucher: Sanctions should change behavior. The US chose to reinforce that principle.\n\nThe US must ensure sanctions carve outs benefit the Venezuelan people, not just elites\n\nMaduro\u2019s ban on Machado is unjustified and unconstitutional, and left the US government with very little choice but to snap back the sanctions. But the truth is that, amid turmoil in the Middle East and the war in Ukraine, Venezuela policy is running up against a desire to avoid further upending delicate geostrategic balances. Washington is interested in allowing US and European energy companies to continue to operate in Venezuela, while also promoting competitive elections and ensuring that the money does not end up directly in Maduro\u2019s pocket. As the United States offers a new path for consideration of specific licenses to energy companies interested in operating in Venezuela, it will be essential to work to ensure that dollars from oil and gas transactions are circulated among everyday Venezuelans, not kept in the hands of the elite. Any successful approach to Venezuela will have to find ways to address global energy concerns and undercut Russian and Chinese influence, while still advancing a democratic solution.\n\n\u2014Jason Marczak is vice president and senior director of the Atlantic Council\u2019s Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center.\n\nThe US balances democracy promotion with a \u2018complex geopolitical reality\u2019\n\nYesterday\u2019s announcement represents a compromise approach. By snapping back sanctions on Venezuela while still carving out space for Western energy companies to maintain operations, the Biden administration is trying to adjust its approach to promoting democracy and human rights in Venezuela to an increasingly complex geopolitical reality. This is a recognition that it is simply not in the US interest to sit back and watch as Russia and China deepen their footprints in the country with the largest oil reserves on the planet. At the same time, it will be crucial for the Biden administration to continue to find ways to incentivize lasting political agreements in ongoing negotiations between the opposition Unitary Platform coalition and the Maduro government. Fortunately, the US government continues to retain a degree of leverage. The White House can loosen or tighten the sanctions regime moving forward, and can float diplomatic recognition and other incentives as carrots ahead of Venezuela\u2019s election on July 28.\n\n\u2014Geoff Ramsey is a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center.\n\nThe US is seeking a Goldilocks solution to sanctions on Venezuela\n\nThe United States made a subtle and constructive diplomatic step on Venezuela sanctions on Wednesday. It has allowed General License 44 to lapse, ending the period of open access for Venezuelan crude to reach the market, including the United States, through multiple modalities. For now, Venezuela has been punished for its abrogation of the Barbados agreement.\n\nBut the US Treasury Department was clear that it welcomes, within the next forty-five days, requests for specific licenses that serve US interests. This leaves a bureaucratically cumbersome but clear path for companies to request the ability to swap Venezuelan crude for debt they are owed, for diluent or other products to relieve humanitarian distress in Venezuela, and under conditions similar to Chevron\u2019s existing license, which minimizes the fiscal return on exports to PDVSA.\n\nSo the path remains open to ensuring that the Maduro government is punished, but a relief valve for migration pressure inside Venezuela is available. The new policy does not discriminate against US allies by imposing harsher conditions on them than on US companies, as was the case before General License 44. In the event that there is progress on a framework for free and fair elections from Maduro in the days ahead, the potential for a further general license remains open.\n\nThe impact on the global oil market remains to be seen. Much depends on how many private companies apply for debt or product swaps and on whether the small but significant oil projects in Venezuela apply for licenses as well. (If they do not, then we will return to the destructive \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d policy, which had the impact of providing cheap oil for China, a product market for Iran, and humanitarian distress leading to illegal migration to the United States and elsewhere in the region.)\n\nMuch also depends on the ability of the US Treasury to respond to those license requests swiftly. But with this one move, the United States has avoided blame for interference in the Venezuelan elections, preserved diplomatic capital for a future day, and this time managed to punish the aggressor more than the victims. Given the grim circumstances, this was the best outcome available.\n\n\u2014David L. Goldwyn served as special envoy for international energy under President Barack Obama and assistant secretary of energy for international relations under President Bill Clinton. He is chair of the Atlantic Council\u2019s Energy Advisory Group and a nonresident senior fellow with the Council\u2019s Global Energy Center.\n\nWith US sanctions waivers withdrawn, expect China to dominate Venezuela\u2019s oil exports\n\nBiden\u2019s decision to withdraw the sanctions waiver for Venezuelan oil comes at a time when crude oil prices are coming off the highest prices seen this year. Just last month, Venezuela\u2019s crude oil and petroleum product exports hit a four-year high. However, the amount of oil in question is relatively minor on the global scale and should not impact oil prices. In September 2023, the month before the Biden administration issued the waiver, Venezuela exported a total of 797,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil, fuel oil, and methanol (according to TankerTrackers.com). More than 50 percent of its petroleum went to China. Other notable customers included the United States, Spain, Indonesia, and Cuba. By March 2024, Venezuela\u2019s total exports had only increased by about one hundred thousand bpd, but it had significantly diversified its customers. Chinese exports dropped to 39 percent and notable cargoes went to India, the Netherlands, Singapore, Brazil, and Bonaire, Sint Eustatius, and Saba. (Note: Data on oil exports comes via TankerTrackers.com.)\n\nNow that the waivers have been withdrawn, we should expect China to dominate Venezuela\u2019s oil exports. US oil supplies should not be impacted since the total amount of Venezuelan oil and oil products imported by the United States before and after the waivers were issued was nearly identical. Venezuela will probably continue to export at the 895,000 bpd level because China will probably purchase additional cargoes that other nations stop buying now that sanctions are back in place. Overall, Venezuelan revenue may drop slightly as China will likely negotiate lower prices now that the competition for Venezuelan oil is significantly reduced.\n\n\u2014Ellen Wald is a nonresident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council Global Energy Center and the co-founder of Washington Ivy Advisors.\n\nSanctions should change behavior. The US chose to reinforce that principle.\n\nWhen the US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued General License 44 in October 2023, the Biden administration warned that Maduro would need to show concrete steps toward democratic elections for the license to be extended. Evidently, there was insufficient progress, meaning the Biden administration has effectively decided that preserving sanctions\u2019 integrity and US credibility are as important as the outcomes for Venezuela. Given the centrality of sanctions to numerous US foreign policy objectives, I\u2019m not surprised to see a choice that reinforces the principle that the goal of sanctions is to change behavior.\n\nInternational oil companies must now decide how much they enjoyed the fleeting access to Venezuelan crude. Venezuela had stood to gain an estimated $8 billion more in oil revenue in 2024 over the previous year\u2019s earnings. One must wonder if Maduro can replicate that figure without the United States offering sanctions relief.\n\nCompanies that do not wind down previously authorized transactions by the end of May expose themselves to US sanctions risks, and we could see a crackdown on third parties evading the reimposition of these sanctions. Some key players to watch are Indian and Chinese oil companies. OFAC is no doubt learning from its parallel enforcement efforts with respect to the Russian oil price cap.\n\n\u2014Jesse Sucher is a former official at the US Department of the Treasury, where he was a deputy director of the Office of Investment Security, and a section chief and investigator for the Office of Foreign Assets Control.

        "text": "SCOTUS Denies Rehearing Request by Attorneys Sanctioned for Meritless Election Lawsuit\nLANSING \u2013 Earlier this week, the U.S. Supreme Court denied a rehearing request for Sidney Powell and several other attorneys seeking to overturn sanctions imposed against them for filing a meritless challenge to the November 2020 presidential election. The Supreme Court previously denied petitions for certiorari filed by the attorneys in February.\n\nIn June of 2023, a panel of the Sixth Circuit upheld the monetary and disciplinary sanctions imposed against the attorneys by U.S. District Court Judge Linda V. Parker in August of 2021. In her opinion granting the sanctions, Judge Parker wrote, \u201cThis lawsuit represents a historic and profound abuse of the judicial process. It is one thing to take on the charge of vindicating rights associated with an allegedly fraudulent election. It is another to take on the charge of deceiving a federal court and the American people into believing that rights were infringed, without regard to whether any laws or rights were in fact violated. This is what happened here.\"\n\n\u201cThe actions of Sidney Powell and others were meritless and political, with a total disregard for the oaths they took as attorneys,\u201d said Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel. \u201cI am grateful the U.S. Supreme Court once again denied their request to undo the sanctions levied against them for trying to undermine our democratic process.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Attorney General will now begin pursuing payment of the sanctions the attorneys owe the State of Michigan.\n\n###",

        "text": "These Three States Will (Probably) Decide the 2024 Elections\nMichigan\n\nAfter flipping from Barack Obama in 2012 to Donald Trump in 2016 and back to Joe Biden in 2020, Michigan is one of the key swing states. Biden won the Wolverine State by nearly 3 points in the last presidential race, but he got to run against an unpopular incumbent. This time, Biden is the unpopular incumbent, bearing the blame for the country\u2019s ills.\n\nIf Biden continues to struggle in Arizona and Georgia, where he won in 2020 by less than one-half of 1%, he likely needs Michigan\u2019s 15 electoral votes in order to win reelection (along with Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Nevada).\n\nWinning Michigan again won\u2019t be easy because Biden can\u2019t afford any slippage among Black voters (12% of Michigan\u2019s 2020 electorate) or Arab Americans (2.2% of the state\u2019s voting age population), particularly with the ongoing conflict in Gaza.\n\nMichigan is also hosting a competitive Senate race. It\u2019s reasonable to believe that an incumbent would outrun Biden, but this seat is open because Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow is not seeking reelection. It will be more difficult for the likely Democratic nominee, Rep. Elissa Slotkin, to overperform the top of the ticket significantly, which will be a problem if Biden loses Michigan.\n\nDemocrats can\u2019t lose Stabenow\u2019s seat because they have no room for error in the fight for the Senate, since the party is going to lose Joe Manchin\u2019s seat in West Virginia. If Trump wins, this Senate race won\u2019t matter as much because the new vice president could break tie votes and give control to Republicans. But if Biden wins, then holding Michigan is essential for Senate Democrats. Republicans will choose a nominee on Aug. 6.\n\nThere are also a handful of important House races in Michigan. Democrats need to at least break even on competitive races to have any chance of gaining the four seats they need nationwide for a House majority. That includes holding the open 7th District, currently held by Slotkin, which is rated as a Toss-up by Inside Elections, and the open 8th District, held by retiring Rep. Dan Kildee, which is rated Tilt Democratic. Democratic Rep. Hillary Scholten in the 3rd District (rated Likely Democratic) also needs to win re-election. If Democrats can knock off GOP Rep. John James in the 10th District (rated Lean Republican), they\u2019ll likely be on their way to a majority, but it\u2019s not necessary for control.\n\nEven though candidates pay less for their television ads than the party committees or super PACs, all of the activity will make advertising more expensive for everyone.\n\nNevada\n\nWith just six electoral votes, Nevada might seem insignificant, but it\u2019s an important piece of Biden\u2019s electoral equation. As veteran Nevada-based analyst Jon Ralston says, \u201cWe matter.\u201d\n\nDemocratic nominees have won Nevada in the past four presidential elections, but Biden is at risk of losing the state in 2024. He won it by 2.4 points last time but is in a fundamentally weaker position this cycle. Part of that softness in his support is among Hispanic voters.\n\nLatino voters made up 17% of the Nevada electorate in 2020, according to the exit poll for the media consortium, and Biden won those voters 61% to 35%, a margin of 26 points. Biden is running closer to 18 points ahead of Trump among Latino voters in national head-to-head surveys against Trump, according to former Democratic pollster Adam Carlson. If that dynamic exists in Nevada, the state will be uncomfortably close for the president. Similar to Michigan, Biden probably needs to win Nevada if he doesn\u2019t carry Arizona and Georgia as he did in 2020.\n\nBiden\u2019s struggles are potentially problematic for Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen. In 2020, Maine was the only state to split its ticket by voting for Biden for president and Republican Susan Collins for Senate. That dynamic could concern Democratic senators in states Biden won\u2019t, or might not, carry in 2024, including Rosen, Sherrod Brown in Ohio, Jon Tester in Montana, Tammy Baldwin in Wisconsin and Bob Casey Jr. in Pennsylvania.",

The move came as Venezuela's authoritarian regime cracks down on the opposition ahead of the country's presidential election. Reporter John Otis has more.\n\nJOHN OTIS, BYLINE: Last October, the U.S. and Venezuela cut a deal. At a meeting in Barbados, Venezuela agreed to take steps towards holding a free and fair presidential election. In exchange, the U.S. lifted crippling oil sanctions that had been in place since 2019. An election has been scheduled for July 28. However, Nicolas Maduro, Venezuela's authoritarian president, has continued to oppress his opponents, says Eric Farnsworth of the Council of the Americas think tank in Washington.\n\nERIC FARNSWORTH: The Maduro regime did not live up to its obligations under Barbados.\n\nOTIS: Opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, who polls predict would beat Maduro in a free election, remains disqualified from the race. Government critics and members of Machado's campaign team have been jailed. Meanwhile, the regime has blocked millions of Venezuelans from registering to vote. Francisco Rodriguez, a Venezuelan who teaches international studies at the University of Denver, says the election is shaping up to be a farce.\n\nFRANCISCO RODRIGUEZ: It is the most undemocratic election that Venezuelans have had to face in their history since this country became a democracy in 1958.\n\nOTIS: On Tuesday U.S. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller gave Maduro a final warning.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nMATTHEW MILLER: We have made very clear that if Maduro and his representatives did not fully implement their agreements under the Barbados agreement, we would reimpose sanctions.\n\nOTIS: Just 24 hours later, the U.S. government announced it would put sanctions back in place against Venezuela's oil industry. These measures make it illegal for U.S. companies to sign new agreements with the Venezuelan state oil company, unless issued a waiver by the Treasury Department. The brief period of sanctions relief provided a boost for the Maduro regime. Venezuela could once again sell oil at market prices instead of through middlemen at discount rates. Last month Venezuelan oil exports hit a four-year high. Still, the windfall was not enough to convince Maduro to allow a Democratic opening, says Ryan Berg, a Venezuela expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nRYAN BERG: The frustrating part for most of us is that not much by way of U.S. policy seems to induce behavior change either way, neither maximum pressure nor sanctions relief.\n\nOTIS: The problem for Maduro is that he would likely lose a free election. And should he leave office, Maduro could end up in jail on U.S. charges of drug trafficking and corruption. However, in a speech hours after the sanctions were reimposed, Maduro said Venezuela would not buckle to U.S. pressure.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nPRESIDENT NICOLAS MADURO: (Speaking Spanish).\n\nOTIS: \"They think we're scared,\" Maduro said. \"But neither sanctions nor threats will damage our efforts to build a new economy for Venezuela.\" For NPR News, I'm John Otis.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF CITY OF THE SUN'S \"NASCOSTO NEL MONDO\")\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 NPR.

        "text": "DHS Launches Know2Protect\u2122 Public Awareness Campaign to Combat Online Child Exploitation and Abuse With Many Public and Private Sector Partners\nThere Were Over 36 Million Reports of Suspected Child Sexual Exploitation in 2023, More Than Twice the Number Reported in 2019\n\nDepartment\u2019s New Know2Protect.gov Campaign to Provide Young People, Parents, Community Leaders, and Educators with Resources to Better Prevent and Educate Themselves on These Crimes\n\nWASHINGTON, D.C. \u2013 Today, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced Know2Protect, Together We Can Stop Online Child Exploitation\u2122, a first-of-its-kind national public awareness campaign that brings together public and private sector partners. Key partners include high-profile technology companies, national and international sports leagues, youth-serving organizations and nonprofits, and other private sector partners to raise awareness of this heinous and growing crime and how to keep children safe. Through Know2Protect, DHS and its partners will educate and empower young people, parents, and trusted adults on ways to prevent and combat exploitation and abuse both on and offline, explain how to report incidents of these crimes, and offer support resources for victims and survivors of online child sexual exploitation and abuse.\n\nOnline child exploitation and abuse is reaching epidemic proportions and threatens the safety of children globally. In 2023, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) received more than 36 million CyberTipline\u00ae reports of suspected online child sexual exploitation and abuse (CSEA), a 360% increase over the number of reports received 10 years ago. According to the 2023 WeProtect Global Threat Assessment, the volume of child sexual abuse material has increased globally by 87% over the past five years.\n\n\u201cAll of us, working together, must protect our children from the heinous and growing crime of online child sexual exploitation and abuse. The tragic reality is that, as young people spend more time online, predators around the world increasingly target them through manipulation and deceit,\u201d said Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro N. Mayorkas. \u201cKnow2Protect is a first-of-its-kind national initiative to raise public awareness and prevent these horrific crimes from happening in the first place. Public-private partnerships and targeted trainings are essential to raising awareness and educating the public; identifying, protecting, and supporting victims; and bringing perpetrators to justice. By partnering with national sports leagues, youth-serving organizations, and gaming, technology, and other private sector organizations, Know2Protect will help educate the public, save lives, and prevent tragedies.\u201d\n\nKnow2Protect is the first federal government campaign focused on education and prevention of online CSEA. The campaign\u2019s mission is to mobilize young people, parents, educators, and community leaders to learn the signs of this crime, what they can do to prevent it, how to report it to law enforcement, and how they can support survivors. The Know2Protect.gov website, launching today, is being advertised in 25 media markets and online through digital and physical billboards, posters, as well as displays across the country. The campaign will reach millions of Americans where they are and will disseminate resources to educate the public about this crime \u2014 including a portal specifically for kids ages 10 and older \u2014 and empower them with resources and tools for people to protect themselves and others against online CSEA.\n\nTo reflect the importance of a unified commitment to combat the dramatic and alarming increase of online child sexual exploitation and abuse, today DHS is announcing partners from across society \u2013 from social media and technology companies to sporting leagues and youth-serving organizations \u2013 that have already joined Know2Protect in its important mission. More partners will join the campaign in the coming months.\n\n\u201cThe best way to keep kids safe online is to provide helpful information where they are: on social media and online gaming platforms, and through clubs, sporting events, and organizations. By partnering with a range of companies to raise awareness and disseminate educational messaging, we are keeping kids safe from online predators,\u201d said Know2Protect Campaign Director Kate Kennedy. \u201cWe are grateful for all of our partners who share a commitment to combat online child sexual exploitation and abuse and keep children safe as a result.\u201d\n\nThe National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) has been working with the Department on the development of Know2Protect assets and concepts since its inception. NCMEC subject matter experts and its survivor network reviewed campaign materials to ensure they were appropriate and educational for all audiences.\n\n\u201cOnline Child Sexual Exploitation and Abuse is a growing global concern, and NCMEC is at the forefront of addressing it. The exponential rise in CSEA within the past year underscores the urgency of our mission,\u201d said NCMEC Chief Operating Officer Derrick Driscoll. \u201cNCMEC applauds any initiative or governmental effort aimed at raising awareness about this crime. The Know2Protect campaign helps to do just that. Collaborating globally is crucial to prevent these crimes from happening and families and children should know they are not alone in this fight.\u201d\n\nTECHNOLOGY PARTNERS\n\nGoogle LLC is donating ad credits for Google display, YouTube, and Google Search, which will bolster the reach of the campaign in order to educate as many young people, parents, educators, and community leaders as possible on the signs of child exploitation and abuse and how to keep yourself and others safe both on and offline.\n\n\u201cWe are proud to donate Search and YouTube ads to support the DHS\u2019 campaign raising awareness on the issue of child sexual abuse and exploitation online, including sextortion,\u201d said Google.org Senior Director Annie Lewin. \u201cThrough our broader child safety work, we know how impactful it can be to provide young people and parents with information and tools on how to report these crimes and find resources. By donating ads, we hope to help the DHS reach a wider audience and further educate the public on this timely and urgent issue.\u201d\n\nIntel Corporation is inviting Know2Protect staff to deliver awareness trainings to their staff yearly.\n\n\u201cIntel is proud to support the Know2Protect campaign through education of our employee base to amplify awareness and enable parents and their families to stay safe online,\u201d said Intel Corporate Board Member of NCMEC and Intel Chief Product Sustainability Officer Jen Huffstetler.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. will support the DHS to promote the Know2Protect campaign on Facebook and Instagram, raise awareness about these crimes and how to recognize them, and direct people to information and resources that can support them.\n\n\u201cChild exploitation is horrific. We work aggressively to fight the criminals behind it, from the new tools we announced just last week to protect teens from financial sextortion, to supporting law enforcement in investigating and prosecuting offenders,\u201d said Meta\u2019s Global Head of Safety Antigone Davis. \u201cWe\u2019re pleased to support the Department of Homeland Security in its campaign, which will raise awareness of these crimes, help parents and teens spot potential risks, and direct them to support.\u201d\n\nRoblox Corporation will display in-game billboard advertisements for users of its online platform. These advertisements will share helpful tips for gamers on internet safety and best practices. In the future, Roblox will work with Know2Protect to develop in-game immersive experiences, such as building characters from the campaign\u2019s iGuardian training program and Know2Protect badges for Roblox users.\n\n\u201cRoblox is built on a foundation of safety and civility, and we are proud to support the Know2Protect campaign,\u201d said Roblox Vice President of Civility Tami Bhaumik. \u201cBy educating and empowering people with the knowledge and tools to prevent harm, collectively, we will be in a stronger position to prevent abuse from happening. Sometimes these are difficult issues to talk about, which makes resources and tools all the more important. We are honored to be part of the solution to amplify this important campaign.\u201d\n\nSnap Inc., Know2Protect\u2019s first official partner, is providing Know2Protect in-platform ad credits on its Snapchat platform and conducting research to gauge Snapchatters\u2019 awareness and familiarity with a variety of sexual-related online risks. In the United States, more than 100 million people use Snapchat to communicate with their friends and family, including more than 20 million teenagers. In addition, Snap will promote the Know2Protect website on its dedicated online Privacy and Safety and Parents Hubs.\n\n\u201cThese horrific crimes can\u2019t be ignored \u2013 they need to be discussed in the halls of government, at boardroom tables and at kitchen tables. Young people need to be attuned to online sexual risks, and adults need to understand the issues so they can help young people in crisis,\u201d said Snap Inc Global Head of Platform Safety Jacqueline Beauchere. \u201cThat\u2019s why Snap is honored to be a founding partner of Know2Protect, and to help share educational resources with the millions of teens who use our app daily to communicate.\u201d\n\nNATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL SPORTING LEAGUE PARTNERS\n\nMajor League Baseball (MLB), through their MLB Together CSR platform, will display Know2Protect physical advertisement collateral, such as posters, at the host venue for 2024 MLB All-Star Week in July, and also list Know2Protect on MLBTogether.com as a trusted youth safety resource for players and families to access.\n\n\u201cMLB is proud to join the Know2Protect awareness campaign to address this important issue affecting far too many families in our world,\u201d said Major League Baseball Vice President of Social Responsibility April Brown. \u201cOur Midsummer Classic provides an outstanding platform, through our MLB Together initiative, to share this critical information with families across the country.\u201d\n\nMajor League Soccer (MLS) will highlight the campaign during the July 24, 2024 MLS All-Star Game presented by Target.\n\n\u201cThe mission of Know2Protect to keep children safe from online exploitation is vitally important at this time, and Major League Soccer considers it an honor to work with the Department of Homeland Security, Secretary Mayorkas, and the NCMEC on this global campaign,\u201d said MLS Commissioner Don Garber. \u201cWe are dedicated to using the platforms of our league and 30 clubs to share the resources and guidance of Know2Protect, and to do everything in our power to assist in the fight against the abhorrent crime of child exploitation.\u201d\n\nNASCAR will display Know2Protect promotional assets and materials during races around the country.\n\n\u201cNASCAR is proud to partner with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to help raise awareness of its important Know2Protect initiative,\u201d said NASCAR President Steve Phelps. \u201cThe DHS has been a strong partner to NASCAR over the years, and we\u2019re honored to have been asked to take part in this vital program that protects children throughout this great country.\u201d\n\nThe National Football League (NFL) will work to amplify the Know2Protect campaign by raising awareness among clubs and players, and running Know2Protect public service announcements on various platforms, including NFL Media.\n\n\u201cKeeping our children safe is something we can all agree on, and the NFL is proud to support DHS\u2019 efforts to stop online abuse and exploitation,\u201d said NFL Senior Vice President and Chief Security Officer Cathy Lanier. \u201cWe commit to using the league\u2019s platform to raise awareness about this real and growing threat, and to highlight a national campaign to protect young people from predators and other bad actors.\u201d\n\nThe National Hockey League (NHL) will display advertisements and host in-person events at its games, while also amplifying campaign messaging on its network and among its various social media platforms.\n\n\u201cThe National Hockey League is proud to support this vital initiative and contribute to the protection of our nation\u2019s youth and most vulnerable,\u201d said NHL Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Security Officer Jared Maples.\n\nThe United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee (USOPC) will work with Know2Protect to provide virtual presentations to Team USA athletes and parents on the threat of online CSEA and the preventative strategies they can implement to keep all Team USA Athletes safe.\n\n\u201cKeeping Team USA athletes safe where they live, train and compete is the USOPC\u2019s top priority. As part of that effort, educating athletes and their support communities is an essential step in prevention,\u201d said USOPC Senior Vice President and Chief of Security & Athlete Services Nicole Deal. \u201cWe are happy to partner with Know2Protect as an important part of our holistic commitment to creating safe environments and providing more resources for Team USA athletes.\u201d\n\nYOUTH-SERVING ORGANIZATIONS\n\nBoy Scouts of America (BSA) will collaborate with Know2Protect to promote knowledge sharing and empowerment for youth and parents. The BSA will also facilitate Project iGuardian presentations for Scouts and parents and explore developing a co-branded BSA patch in recognition of taking an in-person Project iGuardian training at the local or national level.\n\n\u201cSafeguarding our Scouts so that we can prevent harm will always be our most important mission, and that includes their online safety,\u201d said Boy Scouts of America President and CEO Roger Krone. \u201cThrough this collaboration with DHS, Scouting will make the Know2Protect resources available to empower more than a million youth members and adult volunteers, further enhancing our education and training initiatives to help ensure that our Scouts, leaders, and their families remain safe from online dangers.\u201d\n\nNational Police Athletic League (National PAL) will host Know2Protect representatives to train its members across the nation at both the National PAL Conference and Youth Mentoring Summit. National PAL will also amplify campaign resources in its webpage and on social media platforms monthly. National PAL is committed to protecting the youth at all costs and greatly supports this effort put forth by the Department of Homeland Security.\n\n\u201cNational PAL is extremely excited and honored to partner with the Department of Homeland Security on the Know2Protect campaign. Know2Protect provides another tool for youth, parents, educators, coaches etc. to keep our youth safe from online predators,\u201d said National PAL Board President Christopher Hill. \u201cToday, National PAL will be rolling out the K2P campaign to all of our member chapters immediately to ensure that we are further prepared to protect our youth at all levels! We will make sure our youth are aware that no matter the threat, the iGuardians are there to support and protect them!\u201d\n\nLAW ENFORCEMENT ASSOCIATIONS\n\nLaw enforcement officials across the country are joining the campaign, including the National Fusion Center Association, International Association of Campus Law Enforcement Administrators, and Small & Rural Law Enforcement Executives Association. These law enforcement associations have committed to partnering with the campaign to share information and resources with their members and the communities that they serve; amplify the tools through their communication platforms and channels; and amongst other activities, collaborate with the Department moving forward to further develop training programs for state, local, tribal, territorial, and campus law enforcement across the country.\n\n\u201cThe National Fusion Center Association (NFCA) is proud to be a partner with the Know2Protect Campaign. Our National Network of 80 State and Major Urban Area Fusion Centers, was built on the foundation of helping to protect America through threat detection, criminal intelligence analysis, and information sharing,\u201d said NFCA President Mike Sena. \u201cWe are honored to be working with the Know2Protect Campaign in its effort to empower children, teens, parents, trusted adults, and policymakers to prevent and combat online child sexual exploitation and abuse.\n\n\u201cOur children are one of the most vulnerable members of our society. We must do all we can to fight those who would exploit and take advantage of them,\u201d said IACLEA Executive Director Paul Cell. \u201cInternational Association of Campus Law Enforcement Administrators (IACLEA) stands united and in support of the work K2P is doing to insure our children are educated on the dangers of online predators and how they can identify when they are being targeted.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Small and Rural Law Enforcement Executives Association (SRLEEA) wholeheartedly endorses the DHS's Know2Protectcampaign, highlighting its vital role in smaller, rural, and tribal communities. These areas often encounter increased risks due to scarce resources, and this initiative is crucial for providing necessary awareness and tools to combat online child exploitation. The impact of Know2Protect in empowering our communities and law enforcement to protect our most vulnerable from these evolving threats is invaluable,\" said Chair of the SRLEEA Human Trafficking Committee Sheriff Kim Stewart.\n\nKnow2Protect is the latest example of DHS\u2019s ongoing efforts to address online child sexual exploitation and abuse and comes after the Department\u2019s Quadrennial Homeland Security Review added combating crimes of exploitation and protecting victims as a sixth mission area in April 2023. Learn more about recent DHS efforts to combat child exploitation and abuse.\n\nKnow2Protect will highlight the whole of DHS efforts to combat online CSEA, including:\n\nHomeland Security Investigations (HSI), which serves as the principal investigative arm of DHS and protects the public from crimes of victimization, including child sexual exploitation. HSI works to investigate, apprehend, and prosecute offenders and identify, protect and support victims. HSI also prevents transnational child sexual abuse, including those who travel internationally to engage in illicit sexual conduct with minors. HSI oversees Know2Protect and Project iGuardian, Know2Protect\u2019s educational program to teach the public about the ongoing threats children and teens face from online predators.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Secret Service supports the protection of minors from CSEA through advanced investigative and forensic support to state and local law enforcement agencies, such as providing support for polygraphs of suspected perpetrators, advanced analysis of photo or video evidence, and assistance on cases related to missing and exploited children. The U.S. Secret Service\u2019s Childhood Smart Program, created in partnership with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, educates parents, children, and teens about internet and personal safety.\n\n\n\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) administers SchoolSafety.gov, a collaborative, interagency website that provides schools and districts with actionable recommendations to create safe and supportive environments for students and educators. The site is an access point for information, resources, guidance, and evidence-based practices on a range of school safety topics, including online exploitation.\n\n\n\nThe DHS Science and Technology Directorate supports DHS offices by providing technical and scientific expertise. It also researches, develops, and deploys leading-edge forensic tools and technologies.\n\nThe campaign will continue to spread prevention and awareness messaging through partnerships, a robust social media presence, and training and outreach to schools and communities through age-appropriate educational presentations provided by agents from Homeland Security Investigations and the U.S. Secret Service.\n\nTo demonstrate the Department\u2019s unified focus on combating cybercrimes, Secretary Mayorkas redesignated the HSI Cyber Crimes Center as the DHS Cyber Crimes Center (DHS C3), strengthening the Department-wide effort to combat cyber-related crimes and online CSEA. The Department works alongside our U.S. and international government partners to raise awareness of these threats, investigate, apprehend, and prosecute offenders, and to identify, protect, and support victims. The entire Biden-Harris Administration has identified online child safety and security as a top priority, creating the White House Online Harassment and Abuse Task Force, the Kids Online Health and Safety Task Force, and the Australia-U.S. Joint Council on Combatting Online Child Sexual Exploitation, all of which the Department plays a leading role.\n\nThe Department\u2019s participation in multilateral partnerships, such as the Five Country Ministerial, has led to important initiatives such as the development of the Voluntary Principles to Counter Online Child Sexual Exploitation, also endorsed by the G7 foreign ministers, and the Children Online Protection Lab, led by France, which the United States participates as a member of the Executive Committee, all of which are crucial in combating this borderless crime.\n\nWHAT YOU CAN DO\n\nHOW TO REPORT SUSPECTED ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL EXPLOITATION AND ABUSE\n\nContact your local, state, campus, or tribal law enforcement officials directly. Call 911 in an emergency.\n\n\n\nIf you suspect a child has been abducted or faces imminent danger, contact your local police and the NCMEC tip line at 1-800-THE-LOST (1-800-843-5678).\n\n\n\nIf you suspect a child might be a victim of online sexual exploitation, call the HSI Tip Line at 1-866-347-2423 and report it to NCMEC\u2019s CyberTipline.\n\nKnow2Protect is managed by the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Cyber Crimes Center.

        "text": "The American illusion of choice\nImagine you\u2019re in a race with 100 other runners, but 98 of them \u2013 including yourself \u2013 have their legs tied; would you consider that fair? Of course not. This is a situation that is far too applicable to the state of modern American political parties. For over a century, only two parties have dominated American politics \u2013 the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. Locating them on the political spectrum, the Democrats are on the left and the Republicans are on the right; while there is merit to the claim that the two parties are ideologically different, the same cannot be said about them on the functional level. What do I mean by this? Let me explain.\n\nThere is no doubt that the Republicans and Democrats have different views on issues like abortion, immigration and the Second Amendment. However, the two political entities support very similar policies to maintain their overwhelming power in Congress: they both exploit the media to shift public opinion and remain relevant in the headlines; they both accept billions of dollars from corporations and private lobbyists to fund campaigns and aid their aristocratic allies; and they both support a winner-take-all system of voting to curtail the success of alternative parties in Congress.\n\nBy consolidating power, the two parties have narrowed themselves as the only viable options to govern the nation. The Democrats and Republicans are two preselected choices which create an illusion of ultimate democracy. This peculiar dynamic in government feels more like a diarchy than a flourishing democracy. Moreover, it is essential to note that Americans are not satisfied with the current two party system. As a simple litmus test of American satisfaction with the current two party system, take the example of the candidates put up by the Democrats and Republicans for the upcoming presidential election; a 2024 Reuters poll on voter satisfaction found that 67% of Americans said that they are \u201ctired of seeing the same candidates in presidential elections and want someone new.\u201d\n\nIf people are so tired of old and familiar politicians put up by the same old and familiar parties, then why can\u2019t they just vote new people and parties into power? To answer that question we have to look at the diarchy\u2019s undying love of the \u2018Single Member Plurality (SMP) Voting System\u2019 which is technical jargon for a winner-take-all system. The SMP system works by disregarding other votes in an election and simply focusing on the majority. An example of the SMP system in action can be seen in these mock results for a congressional seat election: The results read: 51% to the Republican Party, 20% to the Libertarian Party, 20% to the Democratic Party and 9% to the Green Party. Because the Republican candidate got 51% of the vote, only one Republican will be sent to Congress to represent everyone, leaving the other 49% voiceless.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe SMP system is in contrast to the \u2018Proportional Representation\u2019 system where each party would gain a number of representatives in Congress according to their percentage won in the election; an eat what you hunt style voting system. By failing to win the majority of the votes, political groups become marginalized and ignored. And in places where Republican and Democratic political machines are cemented into power, the overwhelming power of the SMP system is insurmountable by alternative political parties. A Proportional Representation system combats this.\n\nThe diarchy of Republicans and Democrats leads to a complacent government, a complacency rooted in the reliability of remaining in power. If there is no third party to threaten the political seesaw of swapping Republicans for Democrats \u2013 and vice versa \u2013 the two parties will simply continue to maintain the status quo. To reform the United States government, American constituents should take a lesson from European Parliaments and begin to examine the implications of proportional representation into the US government. The more perspectives a government can have the better; more well-rounded policies will emerge from understanding their impacts on different communities, people and industries.\n\nUsing the SMP system to tarnish the representativeness of a republic is nothing short of a nightmarish irony, one which is detrimental to the progression of American democracy. I believe it is crucial for constituents to explore and vote for other candidates to begin to shake the pillars of power on which the diarchy reigns.\n\n(Visited 1,210 times, 1 visits today)",

        "text": "At Fordham Law, Political Correspondent Steve Kornacki Breaks Down the 2024 Presidential Election\n(L-R) Adjunct Professor Jerry Goldfeder and Steve Kornacki\n\nA standing-room-only crowd gathered to hear journalist Steve Kornacki talk about his life and career path during an hour-long conversation with Adjunct Professor Jerry Goldfeder, director of the Law School\u2019s Voting Rights and Democracy Project. Kornacki, of course, is known for his on-point political analysis and presentation while using the \u201cBig Board,\u201d an interactive screen providing detailed election data.\n\nA national political correspondent for NBC News and MSNBC, Kornancki catapulted to viral celebrity status in 2020 due to his tireless coverage of the U.S. presidential race and election. Outside of politics, he has been tapped to bring his unique analytic style to pop culture and sports and break down predictions, including for the 2024 Oscars, 2021 Kentucky Derby, and 2020 Tokyo Olympics.\n\nAt one point, Goldfeder asked about his prediction for the 2024 presidential election, rolling out a huge, blank whiteboard and handing Kornacki a marker to make his case in his trademark style. Goldfeder assisted by drawing a very makeshift version of the map of the United States. With great good humor and serious analysis, Kornacki proceeded to detail various scenarios where either President Joe Biden or Donald Trump could get to the magic number of 270 Electoral College votes.\n\nKornacki shared the genesis of his now-iconic \u201cBig Board\u201d: \u201cI was watching CNN\u2019s election night [coverage]in either 2004 or 2006, and it was the first time I ever saw one of those [electronic, interactive] boards. It clicked with me right away\u2014I was like, if ever I can get a chance to do something like this, I\u2019d love to. Of course, it wasn\u2019t even really a job back then.\u201d\n\nKornacki also shared insight into how polls have changed since entering the field and what makes a trustworthy poll, \u201cThe one-word answer to the last part of that [question]is transparency. There\u2019s one thing that\u2019s changed with polling in the time I\u2019ve been covering it\u2014there\u2019s a lot more of it now and a lot of it is coming from sources that are kind of new to the game \u2026 some of them have unclear methodologies. If they\u2019re not going to be transparent, I can\u2019t go on the air and say, \u2018Here are the numbers.\u2019\u201d\n\nKornacki added, \u201cSince there\u2019s more interest in politics than ever before, certainly in modern times, and since the margins of these elections have been so close, it\u2019s only natural that people are going to scrutinize the polls with \u2026 an intensity you didn\u2019t see before. So, I understand that and I recognize that.\u201d\n\nAfter the presentation, Kornacki met with students and signed copies of his book The Red and the Blue, an analysis of how our modern politics became so partisan.\n\n\u201cIt was wonderful having the students meet Steve,\u201d said Goldfeder. \u201cHe is whip-smart, and very down to earth at the same time\u2014and brought real life into the law school.\u201d\n\nAdded Cal Mullan \u201925, co-chair of the Voting Rights and Democracy Project, \u201cThe event was the perfect combination between learning about Steve Kornacki\u2019s path to political news coverage and deciphering the electoral map for the 2024 election. I was particularly impressed that Kornacki delivered a stellar presentation with an old-fashioned whiteboard compared to the fancy screens he uses during his day job at MSNBC.\u201d\n\nView more scenes from the event:",

        "text": "Historic trial of former President Trump helps and hurts his campaign, experts explain\nFormer President Donald Trump faces an unprecedented array of legal entanglements as he campaigns for reelection, pending federal and Georgia criminal cases and U.S. Supreme Court oral arguments and decisions. These legal challenges have reached the highest level of stakes yet with jury selection completed in his New York state criminal trial.\n\nVirginia Tech experts explained why this trial carries such historical significance, and how it simultaneously strengthens and damages President Trump\u2019s reelection efforts.\n\n\u201cLike much else involving President Trump, this case charging the former resident with 34 felony counts is an historic first,\u201d said political science expert Karen Hult. \u201cNo former president has faced criminal charges that have led to a trial. No presumptive party nominee for the presidency has been tried on felony charges in the midst of a presidential campaign.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe trial in New York generates constant news coverage of Donald Trump, something he already experienced. However, this coverage predominantly portrays him in the context of his legal issues,\u201d said public relations and communications expert Cayce Myers. \u201cThe trial in many ways strengthens Trump's campaign narrative that he is a victim, unfairly targeted by a corrupt establishment. While most candidates would suffer from the negative publicity of a criminal trial, Trump turns these adversities into rallying points for his base.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe trial continues the ongoing Trump public \u2018spectacle,\u2019 complete with social media postings, candidate press conferences, and campaign rallies,\u201d Hult said. \u201cThe impact on possible voters in the November general election is harder to gauge. For many Trump supporters, there likely are mobilization effects; for some other, less intense supporters, de-mobilization or disaffection are possible. For those who are independent or undecided or who do not pay much attention to politics, the trial may be enlightening for some, alienating for others, or marginally entertaining.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe trial in New York generates constant news coverage of Trump, predominantly portraying him in the context of his legal issues. The trial in many ways strengthens Trump's campaign narrative that he is a victim, unfairly targeted by a corrupt establishment. While most candidates would suffer from the negative publicity of a criminal trial, Trump turns these adversities into rallying points for his base,\u201d Myers said. \u201cThe primary drawback for Trump is that it restricts his ability to campaign nationally, particularly at his rallies. This lack of presence will likely mean Trump will need to campaign more than normal through surrogates, who lack his power and charisma.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt this stage, I would expect any effects would be marginal at best for the presidential race \u2014 though in a close race in \u2018swing\u2019 states, a few votes can make a difference. Candidates for \u2018down-ticket\u2019 races, including U.S. Senate and House, governorships, and state legislatures \u2013 perhaps especially Republicans \u2014 might have more reason for concern,\u201d Hult said.\n\nAbout Hult\n\nKaren Hult teaches political science at Virginia Tech and is Ph.D. Director of its Center for Public Administration & Policy, with expertise in the U.S. Presidency, federal and state politics, policy, and governance, and federal and state courts. See her bio.\n\nAbout Myers\n\nCayce Myers is a professor of public relations and director of graduate studies at the School of Communication at Virginia Tech.

        "text": "Multifaceted online coordinated behavior in the 2020 US presidential election - EPJ Data Science\nIn the first subsection we describe the state-of-the-art methodology employed for detecting coordinated communities. In the second subsection we outline our approach to the characterization of each detected community. This involves a comprehensive exploration of various facets that we integrate and analyze simultaneously. Our multi-dimensional analysis offers a rich understanding of the coordinated behaviors in the context of the 2020 US Presidential Election discourse. The overall workflow of our methodology is shown in Fig. 1.\n\nFigure 1 Framework overview. Overview of the framework for studying coordinated behavior, with a focus on the multidimensional characterization Full size image\n\n4.1 Detection\n\nAs previously stated, we detect the coordinated communities that took part in the online debate by applying the state-of-the-art framework proposed by Nizzoli et al. in [9]. The framework integrates a variety of advanced techniques and unfolds through a series of steps. For completeness, in the following we briefly describe each step, by also specifying all choices where our approach diverges with respect to the original method.\n\n4.1.1 Selecting the starting set of users\n\nThe first step of the method by Nizzoli et al. involves selecting an initial set of users. This is useful for filtering out irrelevant users, so as to streamline and improve the computational feasibility of the subsequent analyses [9]. In our study of the US 2020 election data, we focus on highly engaged users who are the primary contributors to the online discussion [39]. In particular, we target the most influential disseminators of information, whom we refer to as superspreaders. Superspreaders are identified as the top 1% of users with the most retweets. Notably, they represent a significant portion of our dataset, accounting for 27% of all tweets and 51% of all retweets. By adopting this approach, we are able to closely examine the activities of the most active users and analyze a substantial part of the overall communication within the network. Notably, the volume of retweets has been recognized a pertinent metric for identifying influential users, a strategy adopted by other studies as well [29, 40].\n\n4.1.2 Selecting the similarity measure\n\nNext, Nizzoli et al.\u2019s framework identifies coordination by detecting repeated similarities in user behaviors. Similarities between users can be observed across many behavioral dimensions. Among them, retweeting behavior similarity is by far the most widely used [12, 29, 41]. Similarly to previous work, we measure user similarities based on their retweeting activity. In detail, each user is defined by the TF-IDF weighted vector of the tweets they retweeted. Pairwise similarities between all users are computed as the cosine similarity of their user vectors. The TF-IDF weighting scheme diminishes the influence of widely popular (i.e., viral) tweets and amplifies the contribution of retweets targeting less popular tweets. This approach is particularly effective at identifying suspicious behaviors and coordination that manifest through the retweeting of not-so-popular posts [9]. At the same time, the methodology accounts for the fact that sporadic retweets of the same content do not imply coordination. On the contrary, this method contributes to uncovering deeper, non-obvious patterns of behavior that might also be indicative of genuine coordination, rather than mere homophily or the virality of popular tweets.\n\n4.1.3 Building the user similarity network\n\nPairwise similarities are converted into a weighted undirected user similarity network, which encodes behavioral and interaction patterns between users. Edge weights in this network are proxies for the degree of coordination [9, 12, 29].\n\n4.1.4 Filtering the user similarity network\n\nBeing based on pairwise similarities, user similarity networks are typically too big to be analyzed straight away. Therefore, all network-based coordination detection frameworks include a filtering step to prune irrelevant edges and disconnected nodes from the network [9, 12]. Nizzoli et al. propose extracting the multiscale backbone [33] of the user similarity network as the filtering technique. This approach allows retaining all statistically significant network structures, independently of their scale. As a result of the multiscale backbone extraction, our filtered user similarity network consists of 9911 nodes and 148,038 edges.\n\n4.1.5 Detecting coordinated communities\n\nThe advantage of network-based representations of coordination lies in the possibility to easily detect groups of users that are strongly coordinated with one another. All network-based coordination detection frameworks identify coordinated groups of users via community detection [9, 10, 12]. Although many community detection algorithms can be used for this task, the vast majority of existing works leverage the Louvain algorithm [42]. In particular, Nizzoli et al. proposed to perform Louvain community detection within an iterative network dismantling process [9]. This approach allows to analyze the structure and behavior of each coordinated community at all degrees of coordination. As such, it provides more nuanced results with respect to the methods that apply fixed and arbitrary edge weight thresholds, which allow analyzing only a single snapshot of the user similarity network. Here, we apply Nizzoli et al.\u2019s approach to the US 2020 user similarity network, detecting the main coordinated communities that took part in the electoral debate. For practical reasons related to computational efficiency and clarity of visualizations, we provide detailed results for the top 10 largest coordinated communities, whose members account for 79% of all retweets.\n\n4.1.6 Characterizing coordinated communities\n\nIn the final step of the analysis, each detected coordinated community is investigated so as to make sense of its intent and actions. The majority of existing literature performed the characterization task via qualitative manual analyses [9, 27]. Here instead, we propose and compute a number of quantitative indicators based on established and state-of-the-art methodologies. Moreover, previous works mainly focused on analyzing either the topics discussed by each community or their network structure and topology [12, 27]. By computing many relevant indicators, here we go beyond existing works by encompassing multiple facets and perspectives. Overall, our new approach to the characterization of coordinated communities offers a comprehensive and nuanced depiction of online coordination. In the following subsection we describe the facets according to which we characterize each coordinated community, the methodologies behind their computation at both user and community level, and their importance in the broader context of our analysis.\n\n4.2 Characterization\n\nWe characterize each coordinated community according to five important facets of coordinated online behavior: (i) the degree of coordination, (ii) the degree to which members of the community make use of automation, (iii) account suspensions by the platform, (iv) the extent of political partisanship of the community, and (v) the degree to which the community shares non-factual news. Each facet offers insights into the intent, behavior, and structure of the coordinated communities, allowing to make sense of their activity and involvement in the US 2020 online debate. Then, in addition to computing and discussing these indicators individually, we also compute a composite measure for these facets, which enables comparative analyses across varied behaviors and forms of coordination. Thus, a key contribution of our work lies in analyzing these facets both separately and in conjunction, providing a holistic view that is instrumental towards evaluating the nature (e.g., harmful and/or inauthentic) and potential impact of coordinated communities.\n\n4.2.1 Coordination\n\nMost state-of-the-art methods cast the coordination detection task as a binary problem, according to which users and communities are either coordinated or non-coordinated [12]. However, coordination within a community expresses the degree to which the actions and behaviors of the community members contribute towards a common goal. As such, multiple degrees of coordination exist, which demand nuanced modeling and analyses that go beyond the simplistic binary definition used so far. Differently from the majority of previous work, our approach for detecting coordination assigns a coordination score on a continuous scale \\(\\in[0, 1]\\) to each user in a community. In [9], this coordination score is used to build a coordination curve for each community that quantifies the fraction of community members at any given coordination score. It is then left to the analyst to manually interpret the coordination curves and the behavior of the detected coordinated communities [9].\n\nHere we take a step forward by computing an aggregated coordination score for each community, as the area under the coordination curve. Similarly to the user-level coordination score, also the community coordination score \\(\\in[0, 1]\\) and quantifies the degree to which the members of the community are coordinated between one another. The advantage of this approach lies in the possibility to have an objective and quantitative indicator of the degree of coordination within a community, rather than a subjective assessment derived from manual inspection. In addition, the aggregated coordination score lends itself to useful comparisons with other indicators that can be computed for the same communities, as described in the following.\n\n4.2.2 Automation\n\nAutomation of a number of social media accounts is one of the ways in which online coordination can be achieved. For example, social botnets exploit the synchronization allowed by the use of automation to effectively push narratives or support certain public characters [43]. As such, social botnets that tamper with the regular flow of information are a paramount example of inauthentic and harmful coordination [10, 35, 44]. However, not all inauthentic and harmful coordination is carried out via automated means,Footnote 5 let alone authentic and harmless one. This makes the analysis of automation a useful complement, rather than a substitute, to the analysis of coordination.\n\nMany bot detection methods have been proposed in the last few years [45\u201347], with Botometer being the de facto standard in the field. Here we resort to Botometer v4 [48] to obtain an estimate of the degree of automation in Twitter accounts. Botometer assesses an account\u2019s similarity to known social bot characteristics by analyzing a comprehensive range of features, including: account metadata, network of friends, social network structure, patterns of activity, and the use of language and sentiment expressions. For users who communicate in English, we use Botometer English language score, whereas for all other users we utilize the universal score. Similarly to our coordination score, also Botometer automation scores \\(\\in[0, 1]\\), reflecting a continuum of automation rather than a simple binary classification. To assess the degree of automation within a community, we compute the mean automation score of its members. Scores \u22430 indicate communities with minimal automation, while scores \u22431 indicate communities whose members make large use of automation.\n\n4.2.3 Suspensions\n\nAccount suspensions are the actions taken by social media platforms to temporarily or permanently deactivate accounts following repeated policy violations. Among the reasons for account suspensions is engaging in antisocial behavior, spamming, or using hateful and toxic speech [49]. Notably, Twitter\u2019s suspension practices have often been associated with political activities [50]. Analyzing account suspensions is thus relevant because each suspension provides evidence that the suspended account behaved in violation to the platform\u2019s policies. Suspensions are thus a proxy for harmful behaviors.\n\nWe obtain the suspension status of a Twitter account directly from Twitter\u2019s APIs,Footnote 6 which provide a distinct error code when an account is suspended [51\u201353]. The suspensions score for a coordinated community is then computed as the fraction of the members of that community that have been suspended for policy violations. This facet sheds light on the prevalence of harmful behavior within a community, enriching our analysis into the community\u2019s conduct and its repercussions on the broader ecosystem.\n\n4.2.4 Political partisanship\n\nIn this study, assessing the degree of political partisanship of coordinated communities is particularly relevant given that our analysis is focused on the US 2020 presidential elections. Multiple methods have been recently proposed to compute social media scores of political partisanship, bias, or leaning [54\u201356]. Among them, here we compute a community score of political partisanship based on the political bias of the news shared by community members, which is a widely-used approach in this field [1, 57]. In detail, we first extract all URLs contained in the tweets shared by the members of each coordinated community. Then, we standardize each URL by resolving redirections from shortening services, by extracting the domain from the URL, and by grouping together URLs pointing to the same domain. We subsequently filter out all domains that do not correspond to news outlets. Finally, we assign a political partisanship score to each URL based on the political bias of the corresponding news outlet. We rely on Media Bias/Fact Check (MBFC)Footnote 7 to obtain an extensive list of news outlets and the corresponding political bias scores. MBFC is a well-known resource that provides expert-driven ratings of the political bias and factual accuracy of many news outlets. Being primarily targeted at US outlets, this resource is particularly suitable for our analysis. MBFC categorizes each news outlet into one of six ordinal political bias categories, ranging from extreme-left to extreme-right. Here we convert each category to a numeric score by respecting their order, such that a score of \u22121 corresponds to extreme-left news outlets, and a score of +1 corresponds to extreme-right ones, with all other values in between. We then compute the political partisanship score for each member of a coordinated community, which represents the average political bias of the news outlets shared by that member. Next, the political partisanship of a coordinated community is computed as the mean of the political partisanship scores of the members of that community. Finally, in those analyses where we are interested in the extent of political polarization independently of the political direction of such polarization, we consider the absolute value of the community-level political partisanship score, such that scores \u22430 indicate minimal polarization while scores \u22431 indicate strong polarization (either towards the left or right). Notably, being defined \\(\\in[0, 1]\\), this latter indicator is suitable to be compared to all other indicators used to characterize coordinated communities.\n\n4.2.5 Nonfactuality\n\nIn the context of information disorder, coordination is often exploited to boost the spread of false or misleading information, with the ultimate goal of manipulating public opinion and sowing discord [10]. Here, we account for this possible use of coordinated behavior by measuring the (non)factuality of the news shared by members of the coordinated communities. Nonfactuality refers to the extent to which information shared within a community deviates from accurate and reliable news, thus implying the spread of mis- or disinformation.\n\nSimilarly to our approach for measuring political partisanship, we measure the degree of nonfactuality of each coordinated community by relying on MBFC, which evaluates news outlets based on their commitment to factual reporting. Specifically, MBFC assigns factual ratings to each news outlet according to six ordinal values that range from very high, to very low factuality. Here we convert these ratings to a numerical nonfactuality score \\(\\in[0, 1]\\), such that scores \u22430 indicate high factuality, while scores \u22431 indicate high nonfactuality (i.e., low factuality). User-level nonfactuality scores are obtained by averaging the scores of all news outlets shared by each user. Community-level scores are then obtained by averaging the scores of all members of each community.",

        "text": "Kennedy family makes \u2018crystal clear\u2019 its Biden endorsement in attempt to deflate RFK Jr.\u2019s candidacy\nPHILADELPHIA (AP) \u2014 President Joe Biden scooped up endorsements from at least 15 members of the Kennedy political family during a campaign stop Thursday as he aims to undermine Donald Trump and marginalize the candidacy of independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nKerry Kennedy, a daughter of former Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, niece of former President John F. Kennedy and sister of the current presidential candidate, delivered the endorsements in Philadelphia by calling Biden \u201cmy hero.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want to make crystal clear our feelings that the best way forward for America is to reelect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris for four more years,\u201d she said.\n\nShe never directly mentioned her brother, but insisted \u201cthere are only two candidates with any chance of winning the presidency\u201d this year, framing the campaign as a choice between Biden and Trump, with no room for a third party contender.\n\nBiden, who keeps a bust of Robert F. Kennedy in the Oval Office, said the endorsements were \u201can incredible honor.\u201d He said Trump, the former president who is the presumptive Republican nominee, was a threat to America\u2019s democratic traditions and that \u201cnow it\u2019s time to keep going and not slow down because there\u2019s so much at stake.\u201d\n\nWhat to know about Trump\u2019s second term:\n\nStaffing the administration: Here are the people Trump has picked recess appointments Follow all of our coverage as Donald Trump assembles his second administration.\n\nThe decision to highlight the Kennedy family\u2019s support more than six months from Election Day is an indication of how seriously Biden\u2019s team is taking a long shot candidate using his last name\u2019s lingering Democratic magic to siphon support from the incumbent.\n\nKennedy Jr. played down the endorsements, writing on social media that his family was \u201cdivided in our opinions but united in our love for each other.\u201d He said his campaign was about \u201chealing America.\u201d\n\nGiven Kennedy Jr.'s quixotic political positions and the expectation this year\u2019s campaign will be decided by thin margins, both Democrats and Republicans worry that he could be a spoiler. As a reminder of that potentially decisive role, officials in Michigan said Kennedy qualified for the state ballot on Thursday.\n\nBiden used Thursday\u2019s event, which capped a three-day swing in Pennsylvania, to keep up the pressure on Trump.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump\u2019s vision is one of anger, hate, revenge and retribution,\u201d Biden said, adding, \u201cI have a very different view of America, one of hope and optimism.\u201d\n\nAfter the event, Biden thanked about three dozen supporters and volunteers who were gearing up to call voters or knock on doors for his campaign.\n\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re doing here is bigger than me, bigger than you, bigger than all of us combined. It\u2019s about what kind of country our kids are going to live in,\u201d Biden said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden speaks as members of the Kennedy family Maxwell Kennedy Sr., from left, Joe Kennedy III, Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, Kerry Kennedy and Rory Kennedy listen at a campaign event, April 18, in Philadelphia.

Members of the prominent Democratic family have been vocal that they don\u2019t see eye to eye politically with Kennedy Jr., who started as a protest primary challenger to Biden in the Democratic Party and now is running as an independent. Biden last month hosted more than 30 members of Kennedy\u2019s extended family at the White House for St. Patrick\u2019s Day, when family members posed with the president in the Rose Garden and Oval Office.\n\nLater, Biden and members of the Kennedy family were to meet with supporters at a campaign event, and some Kennedy were planning to make calls to voters and knock on doors on Biden\u2019s behalf.\n\nSeveral notable members of the family were not endorsing, including Caroline Kennedy, the U.S. ambassador to Australia, and nonprofit leader Maria Shriver, which the Biden campaign said was due to their nonpolitical professional roles.\n\nShriver, however, has been a conspicuous White House guest recently, attending the State of the Union and speaking at a women\u2019s history month reception last month.\n\nBernard Tamas of Valdosta State University, an expert on third parties, said it was unclear whether Kennedy Jr. would pull more votes from Democrats or Republicans.\n\n\u201cHe is pro-science when it comes to the environment, but a conspiracy theorist when it comes to vaccines,\u201d Tamas said.\n\nKennedy Jr.'s lack of a clear political lane limits his potential impact on the election, Tamas said, but Democrats appear to be more concerned because his last name could lead some voters to believe that he is carrying on his family\u2019s political legacy.\n\nOther than that, Tamas said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what else he has to attract progressive voters.\u201d\n\nKennedy Jr. has spoken publicly in the past about disagreeing with his family on many issues, but maintains it can be done in \u201cfriendly\u201d ways. After a super political action committee supporting his campaign produced a TV ad during the Super Bowl that relied heavily on imagery from John F. Kennedy\u2019s 1960 presidential run, Kennedy Jr. apologized to his relatives on the X social media platform, saying he was sorry if the spot \u201ccaused anyone in my family pain.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic National Committee has hired a communications team to combat the appeal of third-party candidates, Kennedy Jr. first among them. The DNC also filed a recent Federal Election Commission complaint against Kennedy Jr.\u2019s campaign, charging that it coordinated too closely with an affiliated super PAC to get his name on the presidential ballot in some states.\n\nKennedy Jr. is also viewed warily by the Trump campaign. While Trump has released a recent video saying, \u201cIf I were a Democrat, I\u2019d vote for RFK Jr. every single time over Biden,\u201d he has sometimes criticized Kennedy Jr. as being more \u201cradical left\u201d than Biden.\n\nOn his way out of town, Biden made a swing by a Wawa, accompanied by Mayor Cherelle Parker, where he picked up some food and ordered a black and white milkshake. That served to cover Biden\u2019s bases on one front, given his stop Wednesday in Pittsburgh at a Sheetz, a rival convenience chain.\n\nBiden\u2019s travels across Pennsylvania this week were an opportunity to reconnect with his roots, starting on Tuesday in Scranton, where he lived until age 10. He swung by his childhood home, a three-story colonial that his family rented, and reminisced about attending Mass at St. Paul\u2019s.\n\nIn Pittsburgh, he called for higher tariffs on steel and aluminum from China to protect U.S. industry from what he called unfair competition. But even that event involved some nostalgia, as Biden recalled an endorsement from the steelworkers when he was \u201ca 29-year-old kid\u201d from Delaware running for U.S. Senate.\n\n\u201cIt changed everything,\u201d he said.",

        "text": "G7 Italy 2024 Foreign Ministers\u2019 Statement on Steadfast Support for Ukraine\nMEDIA NOTE\n\nOFFICE OF THE SPOKESPERSON\n\nAPRIL 19, 2024\n\nThe text of the following statement was released by the G7 foreign ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America and the High Representative of the European Union.\n\nWe, the G7 Foreign Ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America, and the High Representative of the European Union, strongly condemn Russia\u2019s ongoing war of aggression against Ukraine. We reaffirm our unwavering determination to support democratic Ukraine as it defends its freedom, sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity, within its internationally recognized borders. We pay tribute to the bravery and resilience of the Ukrainian people, fighting for their freedom and democratic future.\n\nTen years on since Russia\u2019s illegal occupation of Crimea and its setting up of unrecognized proxy regimes in parts of the Donbas and into the third year of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, we demand that the Russian Federation immediately, completely, and unconditionally withdraws all of its military forces and equipment from the internationally recognized territory of Ukraine. Russia can end this war today.\n\nWe call on all countries to uphold international law and in no way to validate or condone Russia\u2019s attempts to acquire territory by force, in violation of the basic tenets of the UN Charter. We will never recognize the legitimacy of so-called \u201creferenda\u201d or \u201celections\u201d, past or future, held by Russia in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine, nor their results. Illegally holding Russian Presidential elections in Ukraine\u2019s sovereign territories was an outrageous violation of international law.\n\nWe will continue to support Ukraine\u2019s right of self-defense and reiterate our commitment to Ukraine\u2019s long-term security. Based on the Joint Declaration of Support for Ukraine we endorsed in Vilnius in July 2023, we are fully engaged on finalizing and implementing specific, bilateral, long-term security commitments and arrangements with Ukraine, which several G7 countries and other partners have already signed. We are stepping up our defense and security assistance to Ukraine and are increasing our production and delivery capabilities to assist the country. We also support efforts to assist Ukraine building a future force capable of self-defense and deterrence against all aggression.\n\nWe express our resolve in particular to bolster Ukraine\u2019s air defense capabilities to save lives and protect critical infrastructure. We will also work with partners towards this end. In this context we appreciate the Immediate Action for Air Defense Initiative (IAAD) proposed by Germany.\n\nTogether with international partners, we are determined to continue to provide military, financial, political, humanitarian, economic, and development support to Ukraine and its people. We welcome the EU\u2019s adoption of the Ukraine facility of EUR 50 billion, the EU \u201cUkraine Assistance Fund\u201d of EUR 5 billion. We also welcome additional support G7 countries have approved, as well as the swift delivery of budget support in the first quarter of 2024 by Canada and Japan. We urge the approval of further support from other international partners.\n\nWe will continue to help Ukraine repair and restore its critical energy and environmental infrastructure and we re-emphasize our strong support for Ukraine\u2019s energy security, including through the G7+ Ukraine Energy Coordination Group. We express our deepest concern about the reported use of chemical agents by Russia, as a method of warfare.\n\nRussia must pay for the damage and devastation it is causing. We condemn Russia\u2019s recent missile and drone strikes against Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure and cities across Ukraine. We are determined to ensure full accountability and we support Ukraine in obtaining compensation for the loss, injury and damage resulting from Russia\u2019s aggression. We welcome the launch of the Register of Damage caused by the aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine. Russia\u2019s sovereign assets in our jurisdictions will remain immobilized until Russia ceases its aggression and pays for the damage it has caused.\n\nWe welcome the adoption by the EU of the legal acts concerning extraordinary revenues held by private entities stemming directly from Russia\u2019s immobilized sovereign assets also in view to exploring ways to maximize the benefit for Ukraine that can be obtained from these revenues.\n\nWe will continue to explore all possible avenues to aid Ukraine in obtaining compensation from Russia, consistent with our respective legal systems and international law. As requested by Leaders, we will continue our work and advise ahead of the Apulia Summit on all possible avenues and feasible options by which immobilized Russian sovereign assets could be made use of to support Ukraine, consistent with our respective legal systems and international law.\n\nUkraine\u2019s reconstruction, starting with early recovery measures and addressing the current energy emergency, remains key priorities. We will continue to work with the Ukrainian authorities and International Financial Institutions through the Multi-agency Donor Coordination Platform and by leveraging private investments. We welcome the Steering Committee of the enlarged MDCP which took place for the first time in Kyiv on 10 April. We highlight the importance of gender-responsive recovery and the need to address the different needs of women, children and disabled persons as well as other population groups who have been disproportionately affected by Russia\u2019s war of aggression. The reintegration of disabled combatants and civilians remains a priority. Further to the successful Japan-Ukraine Conference for the Promotion of Economic Growth and Reconstruction, we look forward to the Ukraine Recovery Conferences, to be hosted in Berlin in 2024 and in Rome in 2025.\n\nWe welcome the European Council\u2019s decision in December 2023 to open negotiations for Ukraine\u2019s accession to the European Union. We praise Ukraine\u2019s progress in its reform efforts, especially to reinforce the justice system and the rule of law and to fight corruption. These endeavors are in line with the Euro-Atlantic path Ukraine has embraced. We will continue to support Ukraine as it works to implement further reforms to strengthen its democracy.\n\nWe reiterate our support for Ukraine\u2019s efforts to promote a comprehensive, just and lasting peace, consistent with international law, including the UN Charter, with respect for Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity. We will continue to work to achieve the widest possible international support for the key principles and objectives of Ukraine\u2019s Peace Formula, also in view of the high-level international conference planned in Switzerland in mid-June. Russia\u2019s irresponsible nuclear rhetoric and its posture of strategic intimidation, including its announced deployment of nuclear weapons in Belarus are unacceptable. We reaffirm that any use of chemical, biological or nuclear weapons by Russia would be met with severe consequences. In this context, threats by Russia of nuclear weapons use, let alone any use of nuclear weapons by Russia, in the context of its war of aggression against Ukraine are inadmissible.\n\nWe condemn Russia\u2019s seizure and continued control and militarization of Ukraine\u2019s Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, which poses severe risks for nuclear safety and security, with implications for the broader international community. We support the International Atomic Energy Agency\u2019s efforts directed at mitigating such risks, including through the continuous presence of IAEA experts and its focus on ensuring nuclear safety and security at the site.\n\nDespite Russia\u2019s attempts to undermine global food security, Ukraine\u2019s success in securing a corridor through the Black Sea has significantly expanded food exports and continues to help feed the world. We pledge our enduring support to those efforts, including through the EU solidarity lanes and other appropriate mechanisms.\n\nWe remain committed to fully implementing and enforcing our sanctions on Russia and adopting new measures as necessary. We will continue to counter, in close cooperation with third countries, any attempts to evade and circumvent our sanctions and export restrictions. We call on financial institutions to refrain from supporting Russia\u2019s defense industrial base and we will take appropriate steps, consistent with our legal systems, to disrupt and deter this behavior. We will impose additional sanctions on companies and individuals in third countries who help Russia acquire tools and other equipment that aid Russian weapons production or military-industrial development.\n\nWe will continue to apply significant pressure on Russian revenues from energy and other sectors. We call on all countries to reduce their imports from Russia which are supporting its war. We will continue to take steps to tighten compliance and enforcement of the oil price cap. While working to maintain supply stability, we will respond to price cap violations, including by imposing additional sanctions measures on those engaged in deceptive practices while transporting Russian oil and against the networks Russia has developed to extract additional revenue from price cap violations. We will continue taking steps to limit Russia\u2019s future energy revenues. We will continue to impede Russia\u2019s development of future energy projects and disrupt its development of alternatives for energy shipping and other services. We also welcome the steps taken by the UK and U.S. to stop the trade of new Russian base metals on their global metal exchanges. We will continue efforts to reduce Russia\u2019s revenues from metals.\n\nWe condemn in the strongest possible terms North Korea\u2019s unlawful export of arms to Russia and for use in Ukraine. In particular, we condemn North Korea\u2019s exports and Russia\u2019s procurement of North Korea\u2019s ballistic missiles in direct violation of relevant UN Security Council Resolutions and call upon them to immediately cease such activities.\n\nWe call upon Iran to stop assisting Russia\u2019s war effort in Ukraine. Any steps by Iran to transfer ballistic missiles and related technology to Russia, would represent a substantive, material escalation, and t we would respond swiftly and in a coordinated manner, including with new and significant measures against Iran. We call on all countries to prevent the supply of components or other items to Iran\u2019s UAV programmes, which support Russia\u2019s war effort.\n\nWe express our strong concern about transfers to Russia from businesses in the People\u2019s Republic of China of dual-use materials and weapons components that Russia is using to advance its military production. This is enabling Russia to reconstitute and revitalize its defense industrial base, posing a threat both to Ukraine and to international peace and security. China should ensure that this support stops, as it will only prolong this illegal war of aggression in violation of the UN Charter and increase the threat that Russia poses to its neighbors.\n\nWe reiterate our condemnation of the Belarusian regime\u2019s complicity in Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine. We express our continued concern over the regime\u2019s continuing repression of independent media, civil society, and of opposition and citizens that peacefully express their views. We also condemn the ill-treatment of political prisoners and ask for their immediate and unconditional release.\n\nThere can be no impunity for war crimes such as attacks against civilians and critical civilian infrastructure, humanitarian workers, deportation of Ukrainians, including forcible transfer and deportation of Ukrainian children, or grave and serious violations of children\u2019s rights and conflict-related sexual violence. Those responsible for crimes, which are of concern to the international community, will be held to account consistent with international law. We welcome initiatives to address Russia\u2019s unlawful deportation of Ukrainian children.\n\nWe firmly reject the Russian authorities\u2019 baseless attempts to blame Ukraine for the tragic terrorist attack near Moscow on March 22, which was claimed by ISIS. We call on Russia to stop using this tragedy in its disinformation efforts against Ukraine. We remain steadfast in our fight against terrorism, as illustrated by several G7 countries continuing to share information with Russia on this issue.\n\nWe will not relent from holding those responsible for Alexei Navalny\u2019s death accountable, including by continuing to impose restrictive measures and other appropriate actions in response to human rights violations and abuses in Russia. We condemn the Kremlin\u2019s systematic repression of dissenting voices, and we call on Russia to release all political prisoners.",

The candidate who received a majority (26) of states would become the next president.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to wake people up to getting rid of the Democrats and the Republicans and saying that we can actually throw a wrench into this election system,\u201d Mapstead said. \u201cThis would get people in America to Google \u2018What is a Libertarian?\u2019\u201d\n\nAs the party nominee, Mapstead said he would commit $1 million of his own money to spread the \u201cStop 270\u2033 message \u2014 a proposal that would \u201cachieve victory for a Libertarian Party.\u201d\n\nBut just what victory means for a party whose best-ever showing was 3.3% of the popular vote in 2016 was itself a subject of debate among the candidates.\n\n1 of 13 From left, Libertarian presidential candidates Dr. Charles Ballay, Lars Mapstead and Mike ter Maat during a debate at the state Libertarian Party convention at DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel in Salt Lake City on Friday, April 19, 2024. | Megan Nielsen, Deseret News 2 of 13 Attendees listen during a debate between the Libertarian presidential candidates at the state Libertarian Party convention at DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel in Salt Lake City on Friday, April 19, 2024. | Megan Nielsen, Deseret News 3 of 13 Mike ter Maat, one of the Libertarian presidential candidates, speaks during a debate between the Libertarian presidential candidates at the state Libertarian Party convention at DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel in Salt Lake City on Friday, April 19, 2024. | Megan Nielsen, Deseret News 4 of 13 Lars Mapstead, one of the Libertarian presidential candidates, wears a pin reading \u201cUnrig the system\u201d during a debate between the Libertarian presidential candidates at the state Libertarian Party convention at DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel in Salt Lake City on Friday, April 19, 2024. | Megan Nielsen, Deseret News 5 of 13 Dr. Charles Ballay, one of the Libertarian presidential candidates, speaks during a debate between the Libertarian presidential candidates at the state Libertarian Party convention at DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel in Salt Lake City on Friday, April 19, 2024. | Megan Nielsen, Deseret News 6 of 13 Signs for the candidates are pictured during a debate between the Libertarian presidential candidates at the state Libertarian Party convention at DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel in Salt Lake City on Friday, April 19, 2024. | Megan Nielsen, Deseret News 7 of 13 Mike ter Maat, one of the Libertarian presidential candidates, speaks during a debate between the Libertarian presidential candidates at the state Libertarian Party convention at DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel in Salt Lake City on Friday, April 19, 2024. | Megan Nielsen, Deseret News 8 of 13 Dr. Charles Ballay, one of the Libertarian presidential candidates, talks to attendees after a debate between candidates at the state Libertarian Party convention at DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel in Salt Lake City on Friday, April 19, 2024. | Megan Nielsen, Deseret News 9 of 13 Dr. Charles Ballay, one of the Libertarian presidential candidates, speaks during a debate between the Libertarian presidential candidates at the state Libertarian Party convention at DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel in Salt Lake City on Friday, April 19, 2024. | Megan Nielsen, Deseret News 10 of 13 Attendees listen during a debate between the Libertarian Party presidential candidates at the state Libertarian Party convention at DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel in Salt Lake City on Friday, April 19, 2024. | Megan Nielsen, Deseret News 11 of 13 Lars Mapstead, one of the Libertarian presidential candidates, speaks during a debate between the candidates at the state Libertarian Party convention at DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel in Salt Lake City on Friday, April 19, 2024. | Megan Nielsen, Deseret News 12 of 13 Mike ter Maat, one of the Libertarian presidential candidates, shakes hands with an attendee after a debate between candidates at the state Libertarian Party convention at DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel in Salt Lake City on Friday, April 19, 2024. | Megan Nielsen, Deseret News 13 of 13 Mike ter Maat, one of the Libertarian presidential candidates, speaks during a debate at the state Libertarian Party convention at DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel in Salt Lake City on Friday, April 19, 2024. | Megan Nielsen, Deseret News\n\n\u201cOur campaign is not about gimmicks,\u201d said Mike ter Maat, an economics professor and former Florida police officer. \u201cThis is about disrupting the way American politics works.\u201d\n\nThis election cycle, maybe more than any other, represents an opportunity for Libertarians to capture the imagination of the American voter, Ter Maat believes. Unlike 2016 or 2020, voters know exactly what they can expect from a Joe Biden or Donald Trump second term.\n\nAnd as the Republican Party continues its departure from fiscal conservatism and the Democratic Party distances itself from anti-war dovishness, Americans are looking for a third option grounded in budgetary and foreign policy principle ready to present a credible candidate, Ter Maat said.\n\n\u201cWe are going to be rolling out policy with the expectation that someone is going to pay attention to us because they recognize that our campaign can fulfill this role,\u201d Ter Maat told the assembled Libertarian party members.\n\nThe party\u2019s policy proposals don\u2019t have to be extreme \u2014 like \u201cend the fed\u201d or \u201clegalize drugs,\u201d or other Libertarian talking points \u2014 to get the public\u2019s attention, according to Charles Ballay, a practicing ENT doctor.\n\n\u201cI think this party needs to realize that being a fringe candidate does not work,\u201d Ballay said. \u201cWe have the power to say \u2018We are the adults in the room.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut the candidates\u2019 positions Friday night largely reflected a Libertarian mindset that is alien to much of the political mainstream. Mapstead vowed to leave the president\u2019s 9,000 appointed bureaucratic positions empty. Ter Maat promised to immediately withdraw from NATO. Ballay said the government should completely remove itself from health care.\n\nWill RFK Jr. spoil Libertarians\u2019 attempt to spoil the election?\n\nAnother stumbling block to blowing up the 2024 election is Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s intention of doing the same.\n\nThough Kennedy briefly flirted with the idea of seeking the Libertarian Party nomination, he said on Sunday he was \u201cnot contemplating joining the Libertarian ticket,\u201d The Hill reported.\n\nKennedy, who consistently garners 10% support in national polls and recently secured ballot access in key battleground states, threatens to \u201ctake a lot of the wind out of\u201d Libertarians\u2019 electoral sails, Ballay said.\n\nBut Libertarians would rather stand by their principles of individual autonomy and non-aggression than pursue a populist path to temporary recognition, said Spike Cohen, a well-known activist within libertarianism and the party\u2019s 2020 vice presidential nominee.\n\n\u201cIf the Libertarian Party were to abandon libertarianism for a higher share of the vote, then we shouldn\u2019t exist,\u201d he told the Deseret News.\n\nThe Libertarian Party presidential debate Friday took place as part of the party\u2019s state convention. The day included various speakers and panels on school choice and the future of the liberty movement.\n\nOn Saturday, the state\u2019s party members will elect 14 national delegates to travel to Washington, D.C., on Memorial Day weekend to vote for the party\u2019s next presidential candidate. Unlike their major party counterparts, Libertarian delegates are not bound by a primary or preference poll to vote a certain way at the national convention.\n\nOver thirty candidates beside Mapstead, Ter Maat and Ballay are running for the Libertarian Party presidential nomination, including Chase Oliver, a former U.S. Senate candidate who helped cause a runoff in Georgia\u2019s 2022 special election.",

        "text": "Biden-Harris Administration Launches Conservation.gov, Showcasing and Supporting the Rapid Acceleration of Locally Led Efforts to Conserve, Protect and Restore Lands and Waters across America\nNew hub will connect communities with resources and funding available through President Biden\u2019s Investing in America agenda\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Today, as part of President Biden\u2019s America the Beautiful initiative, the Biden-Harris Administration launched Conservation.gov, a new website that will help connect people with information, tools, resources, and opportunities to support land and water conservation projects in communities across the country. With more than 41 million acres already conserved, President Biden is on track to conserve more lands and waters than any president in history. In addition, through the President\u2019s Investing in America agenda, the Biden-Harris Administration invested more in conservation and restoration in the first two years of the administration than in any other.\n\nBuilt through an interagency partnership between the Department of the Interior, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Commerce\u2019s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the White House Council on Environmental Quality, the website is a public information hub for staying updated on conservation efforts across the country, finding places to recreate outdoors or to volunteer on public lands, and applying for financial assistance in support of conservation projects.\n\n\u201cFrom protecting Bristol Bay in Alaska and safeguarding the Grand Canyon to making historic investments in local parks and tree cover, President Biden is delivering on the most ambitious land and water conservation agenda in U.S. history,\u201d said Brenda Mallory, Chair of the White House Council on Environmental Quality.\u201cWe are proud to launch Conservation.gov to help celebrate, showcase, and support locally led conservation efforts, which are safeguarding America the Beautiful for our children and grandchildren.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Biden has now conserved more than 41 million acres of lands and waters across the country, leaving a huge mark on the history of American conservation,\u201d said John Podesta, Senior Advisor to the President for International Climate Policy. \u201cWith the launch of Conservation.gov and its tools like the American Conservation and Stewardship Atlas, Americans can explore how they can take action to support conservation in their own communities.\u201d\n\nConservation.gov also houses a beta version of the new American Conservation and Stewardship Atlas. The Atlas is an innovative tool that offers users the ability to view a wide range of scientific information, data, and knowledge on biodiversity, climate change impacts, and equity, with the goal of helping inform and inspire land, water, and wildlife conservation and restoration efforts of individuals, land managers, policymakers, and communities. The beta version is informed by the more than 34,000 comments that the interagency team received when it invited public input.\n\nThe Atlas includes a preliminary framework for tracking progress towards the President\u2019s national goal of protecting, conserving, or restoring at least 30 percent of U.S. lands and waters by 2030. It also presents several preliminary updates on the status and trends of conservation efforts across the country, including that:\n\nSince the launch of the America the Beautiful initiative in early 2021, the U.S. has experienced one of the most rapid accelerations of conservation progress in the nation\u2019s history, with more than 41 million acres of land and water conserved in just over three years.\n\nThe U.S. is on track to meet \u2013 but has not yet met \u2013 President Biden\u2019s goal of protecting, conserving, or restoring at least 30 percent of U.S. lands by 2030.\n\nApproximately one-third of U.S. marine areas are currently conserved, with 26 percent of marine areas conserved in designated Marine Protected Areas. More work remains to conserve a geographically representative, ecologically connected, and climate-resilient set of marine areas off all U.S. coasts.\n\n\u201cPresident Biden issued a national call to action to advance an inclusive and collaborative conservation vision to conserve, connect, and restore our lands and waters \u2013 and the only way we get there is together,\u201d said Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland. \u201cConservation.gov will serve as one tool to empower communities across the country to identify opportunities to further their vision for conservation. The Department of the Interior is proud to partner with agencies across the federal government, Tribes, private landowners, and other stakeholders as we build on the nation\u2019s best conservation traditions and ensure that we have the tools to measure and multiply these critical efforts.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are making bold progress to conserve our ocean, but there is work that still needs to be done \u2013 amid a changing climate \u2013 to connect and sustain marine ecosystems and human communities into the future,\u201d said Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere and NOAA Administrator Rick Spinrad, Ph.D. \u201cA healthy ocean, with a robust and representative network of marine conservation areas, is critical to addressing the effects of climate change and connecting all Americans to the natural wonders of our waters.\u201d\n\n\u201cPublic and private, working lands are the backbone of many rural American communities and of the America the Beautiful initiative, which supports conservation across the country and safeguards the health and integrity of the lands and waters upon which we all depend,\u201d said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. \u201cThanks to historic funding from the Biden-Harris Administration, we are seeing generational investments in our national forests and overwhelming interest from American farmers, ranchers, and private forest landowners in voluntary conservation programs, and this new tool will help to build on that success.\u201d\n\nIn addition to showcasing conservation efforts as well as outdoor recreation and volunteer opportunities across the country, Conservation.gov serves as a gateway for learning more about the America the Beautiful initiative and provides information about how to access the unprecedented investments in conservation and restoration through President Biden\u2019s Investing in America agenda. Additionally, the website showcases federal conservation programs, organized by topic, so that users can access information to assist them in planning and pursuing their own local conservation goals.\n\nAmong the programs featured on the website is the America the Beautiful Challenge. The program, which was launched in 2022 with support from President Biden\u2019s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, is dedicated to funding landscape-scale conservation and restoration projects that implement existing conservation plans across the nation.\n\nThe website also includes a financial assistance tool that matches users with available federal financial assistance based on their eligibility and interests and directs them where to apply. Funding available includes a wide range of programs that are funded through President Biden\u2019s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which makes a significant down payment in protecting our shared natural heritage with $1.4 billion for ecosystem restoration and resilience.",

        "text": "Biden-Harris Administration Finalizes Critical Rule to Clean up PFAS Contamination to Protect Public Health\nBiden-Harris Administration Finalizes Critical Rule to Clean up PFAS Contamination to Protect Public Health\n\nEPA action designates two widely used PFAS as hazardous substances under the Superfund law, improving transparency and accountability to clean up PFAS contamination in communities\n\nApril 19, 2024\n\nContact Information EPA Press Office ( press@epa.gov\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Today, April 19, 2024, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking another step in its efforts to protect people from the health risks posed by exposure to \u201cforever chemicals\u201d in communities across the country. Exposure to per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) has been linked to cancers, impacts to the liver and heart, and immune and developmental damage to infants and children. This final rule will designate two widely used PFAS chemicals, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), as hazardous substances under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), also known as Superfund, and will help ensure that polluters pay to clean up their contamination.\n\nThis final action will address PFOA and PFOS contamination by enabling investigation and cleanup of these harmful chemicals and ensuring that leaks, spills, and other releases are reported. This action builds on the recently finalized standards to protect people and communities from PFAS contamination in drinking water and represents the latest step the Biden-Harris Administration is taking to protect public health and welfare and the environment under EPA\u2019s PFAS Strategic Roadmap and to prevent cancer before it starts through the Biden Cancer Moonshot.\n\nIn addition to the final rule, EPA is issuing a separate CERCLA enforcement discretion policy that makes clear that EPA will focus enforcement on parties who significantly contributed to the release of PFAS chemicals into the environment, including parties that have manufactured PFAS or used PFAS in the manufacturing process, federal facilities, and other industrial parties.\n\n\u201cPresident Biden understands the threat that \u201cforever chemicals\u201d pose to the health of families across the country. That\u2019s why EPA launched its PFAS Strategic Roadmap, a whole-of-agency approach to protecting public health and addressing the harm to communities overburdened by PFAS pollution,\u201d said EPA Administrator Michael S. Regan. \u201cDesignating these chemicals under our Superfund authority will allow EPA to address more contaminated sites, take earlier action, and expedite cleanups, all while ensuring polluters pay for the costs to clean up pollution threatening the health of communities.\u201d\n\n\n\nEPA is taking this step to designate PFOA and PFOS under CERCLA because both chemicals meet the statutory criteria for designation as hazardous substances. Under the rule, entities are required to immediately report releases of PFOA and PFOS that meet or exceed the reportable quantity of one pound within a 24-hour period to the National Response Center, State, Tribal, and local emergency responders. The designation of PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances under CERCLA enables the agency to use one of its strongest enforcement tools to compel polluters to pay for or conduct investigations and cleanup, rather than taxpayers. Designation is especially important as delay in addressing contamination allows PFOA and PFOS more time to migrate in water and soil, worsening existing contamination.\n\nThe final rule also means that federal entities that transfer or sell their property must provide notice about the storage, release, or disposal of PFOA or PFOS on the property and guarantee that contamination has been cleaned up or, if needed, that additional cleanup will occur in the future. It will also lead the Department of Transportation to list and regulate these substances as hazardous materials under the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s long past time for the polluters who poisoned all of us to be held responsible. This comes too late for all the people who were poisoned without their knowledge or consent and have paid the price for one of the greatest environmental crimes in history,\u201d said Ken Cook, President and co-founder of Environmental Working Group. \u201cBut today\u2019s designation of PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances is the first step to bring justice to those who have been harmed. By putting the needs of the people ahead of the profits of the polluters, the Biden EPA is once again delivering for the American people.\u201d\n\nThis final action is based on significant scientific evidence that these substances, when released into the environment, may present a substantial danger to public health or welfare or the environment. PFOA and PFOS can accumulate and persist in the human body for long periods of time, and evidence from scientific studies demonstrate that exposure to PFOA and PFOS is linked to adverse health effects.\n\n\u201cThis is another important step by EPA to protect people and communities from harmful PFAS chemicals, including legacy PFAS contamination across the U.S. The science is clear that PFAS chemicals are linked to a wide range of health harms including cancer, damage to cardiovascular and immune systems, poor pregnancy outcomes, and effects on the developing child,\u201d said Dr. Tracey Woodruff, Professor & Director, Program on Reproductive Health & the Environment (PRHE)/Environmental Research and Translation for Health at the University of California, San Francisco. \u201cBy listing PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances under the Superfund Law, it means that these chemicals will have to be cleaned up from hazardous waste sites and polluters must pay the bill. This is great news for the many communities grappling with PFAS contamination \u2013 many of which are also low income and communities of color. This is another step toward protecting people from the health harms of this well-known toxic chemical.\u201d\n\nEPA\u2019s Superfund program has worked effectively for more than 40 years to target and prioritize cleanups of the nation\u2019s most contaminated sites that present unacceptable risks to human health and the environment. The Superfund program addresses more than 800 hazardous substances, including widespread, highly mobile, and persistent chemicals, like PFOA and PFOS. The program also promotes safer industrial practices that enhance community protections by reducing the likelihood of future releases. Additionally, cleanups allow communities to put land back into productive use, providing opportunities for jobs and economic growth.\n\nIn addition, EPA\u2019s enforcement policy, consistent with EPA\u2019s past practice over decades of implementing the law, will provide additional clarity on the agency\u2019s intent not to pursue certain parties such as farmers, municipal landfills, water utilities, municipal airports, and local fire departments, where equitable factors do not support seeking CERCLA cleanup or costs. EPA has a proven track record of developing and applying enforcement discretion policies that are effective and well-received by stakeholders, ensuring entities that have contributed significant contamination are held accountable.\n\n\n\nBiden-\u2060Harris Administration Takes Critical Action to Protect Communities from PFAS\n\nIn addition to efforts across the government, EPA has taken action under the agency\u2019s PFAS Strategic Roadmap to control PFAS at its sources, hold polluters accountable, ensure science-based decision making, advance environmental justice, and address the impacts on disadvantaged communities. Since launching the Roadmap in 2021, EPA has taken a suite of actions to protect communities from exposure to \u201cforever chemicals\u201d including:\n\nEstablished first-ever national legally enforceable drinking water standard for PFAS : In April 2024, EPA finalized National Primary Drinking Water Regulation (NPDWR) for six PFAS which will protect 100 million people from PFAS exposure, prevent tens of thousands of serious illnesses, and save lives. This action complements the Biden-Harris Administration\u2019s commitment to combatting PFAS pollution and delivering clean water.\n\nDedicated $9 billion in funding to address PFAS and other emerging contaminants in drinking water: President Biden\u2019s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law secured the largest-ever investment in tackling PFAS pollution in drinking water. An additional $12 billion in funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law supports general drinking water investments, including PFAS treatment. The investments are part of the Justice40 Initiative , which aims to ensure that 40 percent of the overall benefits of certain federal investments flow to disadvantaged communities.\n\nGuidance on Destroying and Disposing of PFAS : EPA released updated Interim Guidance which outlines the best-available science on techniques and treatments that may be used to destroy or dispose of PFAS and PFAS-containing materials from non-consumer products, including aqueous film-forming foam for firefighting, and highlights innovation and emerging technologies that warrant further evaluation.\n\nAddressing on-going uses of PFAS : In January 2024 EPA finalized a rule that prevents companies from starting or resuming the manufacture or processing of 329 PFAS; released three methods to better measure PFAS in the environment; and announced the addition of seven PFAS to the list of chemicals covered by the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI), consistent with the Fiscal Year 2020 National Defense Authorization Act.\n\nEPA will publish the Final Rule in the Federal Register shortly. The rule will be effective 60 days after the rule is published in the Federal Register.\n\nRead more about the CERCLA final rule here.\n\nRead EPA\u2019s CERCLA Enforcement Discretion Policy here.\n\nRead more about EPA\u2019s strategy to address PFAS here.\n\nRead more about EPA\u2019s Superfund program here.\n\nRead more about the Superfund Enforcement Program here.",

As a result, it\u2019s a common misconception that only voters who are registered with a political party can vote in primary elections. Nonpartisan voters can vote in primary elections, but there is an extra step if they want to vote in partisan races. Brief summary of nonpartisan voting Additional information can be found below the informational graphics. Nonpartisan voters will receive a nonpartisan ballot. Nonpartisan ballots include all nonpartisan races, such as a Board of Regents or Legislature race in their area. Here\u2019s the extra step: A\u00a0nonpartisan voter can request a nonpartisan-partisan ballot.\u00a0This is in addition to their original nonpartisan ballot. The nonpartisan voter will receive two different ballots: nonpartisan ballot + nonpartisan-partisan ballot. They are only provided one opportunity to vote for each race. Nonpartisan voters who request a nonpartisan-partisan ballot are not voting twice on the same\u00a0race.\u00a0 Nonpartisan voters have four options for nonpartisan-partisan ballots:\u00a0\u00a0 A nonpartisan-Republican ballot (Only the Republican U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representatives races) A nonpartisan-Democratic ballot (Every Democratic partisan race \u2013 Federal, State, County races) A nonpartisan-Libertarian ballot (Every Libertarian partisan race \u2013 Federal, State, County races) A nonpartisan-Legal Marijuana NOW (LMN) ballot (Every LMN partisan race \u2013 Federal, State, County races) For more information on why the nonpartisan-Republican ballot is limited, see\u00a0\u201cWhy are some partisan primaries \u2018open\u2019 and others are not?\u201d section below. If a nonpartisan voter chooses to complete a nonpartisan ballot only, they might not have any races on their ballot.\u00a0This can happen when there are no nonpartisan races up for election in their area. If the voter didn\u2019t choose to complete a partisan ballot (the partial Republican ballot, the full Democratic ballot, the full Libertarian ballot, or the full LMN ballot), they won\u2019t have any races on their ballot. Below is a graphic that describes the primary ballot distribution for partisan and nonpartisan voters.  \u00a0 Below is a copy of Nebraska's early voting application. At the bottom of the page, a nonpartisan voter can request a nonpartisan-partisan ballot.  \u00a0 Below is an in-depth explanation of the process. How primary elections work for voters registered with a political party In a primary election in Nebraska, a voter receives the ballot that corresponds with their registered political party. The recognized political parties in Nebraska are Republican, Democratic, Libertarian and Legal Marijuana NOW. For example, a voter registered with the Republican Party will receive a Republican ballot. The voter will find on that ballot partisan races, such as the presidential race and congressional races, along with all nonpartisan races, such as a city council race. This is the process that happens with voters registered with the Democratic, Libertarian, and Legal Marijuana NOW parties as well. \u00a0 How primary elections work for voters who are not registered with a political party A nonpartisan voter will receive a ballot with all the nonpartisan races up for election in that voter\u2019s area. There is a chance that no nonpartisan races are up for election in the voter\u2019s area, and the voter won\u2019t have any races listed on their nonpartisan ballot. Nonpartisan voters have the option to vote in another party\u2019s primary.\u00a0They just need to request a\u00a0nonpartisan-partisan ballot. A nonpartisan voter who requests a nonpartisan-partisan ballot for the party of their choice will get to vote in all nonpartisan contests and some or all partisan contests for the chosen party, as described below. Nonpartisan voters can choose to complete ONE of the following nonpartisan-partisan ballots:\u00a0\u00a0 A nonpartisan-Republican ballot (Only the Republican U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representatives races) A nonpartisan-Democratic ballot (Every Democratic partisan race \u2013 Federal, State, County races) A nonpartisan-Libertarian ballot (Every Libertarian partisan race \u2013 Federal, State, County races) A nonpartisan-Legal Marijuana NOW (LMN) ballot (Every LMN partisan race \u2013 Federal, State, County races) \u00a0 How to request a nonpartisan-partisan ballot At the polls, nonpartisans can request a nonpartisan-partisan ballot when they check-in with the election workers. If a nonpartisan wants to vote by mail, they can make a request for a nonpartisan-partisan ballot on their early voting ballot application. \u00a0 Why are some partisan primaries \u201copen\u201d and others are not? The Democratic, Libertarian, and Legal Marijuana NOW parties regularly elect to open their primaries to other voters. Nonpartisan voters can choose to complete the full ballot in either the Democratic, Libertarian, or Legal Marijuana NOW primary. The Republican Party has not elected to hold an open primary. That means only voters registered with the Republican Party can complete the full Republican primary ballot. However, nonpartisan voters can choose to complete a partial Republican primary ballot, which only includes U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representatives. Nonpartisans cannot vote in the Republican presidential primary. This is explained further in the \u201cHistorical Context\u201d section below. \u00a0 Nonpartisan races Many races in Nebraska are nonpartisan, such as those for Nebraska Legislature, State Board of Education, Board of Regents, school boards, city councils, natural resources districts, public power districts, community colleges, Learning Community Coordinating Council and Metropolitan Utilities District of Omaha. All Nebraska voters,\u00a0including nonpartisans, have an opportunity to vote in those races and on ballot measures that are up for election in the voter\u2019s respective area. There are some primary elections where voters won\u2019t have any nonpartisan races up for election in their area. For nonpartisan voters, that can mean receiving a blank ballot, unless they request a primary ballot from a specific political party. \u00a0 Checking your party affiliation Voters can check their voter registration information\u00a0here\u00a0to find which party they are registered with. Voters who wish to change their party affiliation will need to update their voter registration. Voters have until the second Friday preceding an election to update their political party in-person at their county election office and until the third Friday preceding an election using any other method (online, mailed application, DMV, etc.). \u00a0 Historical context Nebraska law states nonpartisan voters can vote in partisan races. Neb. Rev. Stat. 32-912(3) states, \u201cA registered voter who is not affiliated with a political party and who desires to vote in the primary election for the office of United States Senator or United States Representative may request a partisan ballot for either or both of such offices from any political party. The election commissioner or county clerk shall post a notice in a conspicuous location, easily visible and readable by voters prior to approaching the receiving board, that a registered voter who is not affiliated with a political party may request such ballots. No such registered voter shall receive more than one such partisan ballot.\u201d The law came into place following\u00a0Tashjian v. Republican Party of Connecticut\u00a0(107 S. Ct. 544 [1986]) where the US Supreme Court struck down Connecticut\u2019s strict closed primary system and allowed political parties the option to open up the primary to nonpartisans. In 1987, the Nebraska Attorney General\u2019s Office issued Opinion 87070 \u201cThe Legality of Closed Primary Elections in Light of Recent Decisions by the United States Supreme Court\u201d on how that case impacted Nebraska. The Qualifications Clauses of the US Constitution state: Article I-2 Clause 1: The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second Year by the People of the several States, and\u00a0the Electors in each State shall have the Qualifications requisite for Electors of the most numerous Branch of the State Legislature. Amendment XVII, Clause 1: The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each State, elected by the people thereof, for six years; and each Senator shall have one vote.\u00a0The electors in each State shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the State legislatures. Nebraska has only one state Legislative branch \u2013 the unicameral. The unicameral is also uniquely nonpartisan. Electors do not need to have a party affiliation to vote for state Legislature in the primary election. Because the electors in Nebraska can be nonpartisan and still vote for state Legislature in the primary election, they too must be able to vote for House of Representatives and Senate in the primary election. In light of\u00a0Tashjian\u00a0and AG Opinion 87070, the Legislature amended state election laws to allow nonpartisans to vote in partisan congressional primaries, resulting in the present-day language found in \u00a732-912. Beyond the requirement that nonpartisan voters be entitled to vote for congressional offices in the primaries, political parties also have the option to fully open their partisan primaries to nonpartisan voters.",

This is explained further in the \u201cHistorical Context\u201d section below.\n\nNonpartisan races\n\nMany races in Nebraska are nonpartisan, such as those for Nebraska Legislature, State Board of Education, Board of Regents, school boards, city councils, natural resources districts, public power districts, community colleges, Learning Community Coordinating Council and Metropolitan Utilities District of Omaha. All Nebraska voters, including nonpartisans , have an opportunity to vote in those races and on ballot measures that are up for election in the voter\u2019s respective area.\n\nThere are some primary elections where voters won\u2019t have any nonpartisan races up for election in their area. For nonpartisan voters, that can mean receiving a blank ballot, unless they request a primary ballot from a specific political party.\n\nChecking your party affiliation\n\nVoters can check their voter registration information here to find which party they are registered with. Voters who wish to change their party affiliation will need to update their voter registration. Voters have until the second Friday preceding an election to update their political party in-person at their county election office and until the third Friday preceding an election using any other method (online, mailed application, DMV, etc.).\n\nHistorical context\n\nNebraska law states nonpartisan voters can vote in partisan races.\n\nNeb. Rev. Stat. 32-912(3) states, \u201cA registered voter who is not affiliated with a political party and who desires to vote in the primary election for the office of United States Senator or United States Representative may request a partisan ballot for either or both of such offices from any political party. The election commissioner or county clerk shall post a notice in a conspicuous location, easily visible and readable by voters prior to approaching the receiving board, that a registered voter who is not affiliated with a political party may request such ballots. No such registered voter shall receive more than one such partisan ballot.\u201d\n\nThe law came into place following Tashjian v. Republican Party of Connecticut (107 S. Ct. 544 [1986]) where the US Supreme Court struck down Connecticut\u2019s strict closed primary system and allowed political parties the option to open up the primary to nonpartisans. In 1987, the Nebraska Attorney General\u2019s Office issued Opinion 87070 \u201cThe Legality of Closed Primary Elections in Light of Recent Decisions by the United States Supreme Court\u201d on how that case impacted Nebraska.\n\nThe Qualifications Clauses of the US Constitution state:\n\nArticle I-2 Clause 1: The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second Year by the People of the several States, and the Electors in each State shall have the Qualifications requisite for Electors of the most numerous Branch of the State Legislature .\n\nAmendment XVII, Clause 1: The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each State, elected by the people thereof, for six years; and each Senator shall have one vote. The electors in each State shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the State legislatures.\n\nNebraska has only one state Legislative branch \u2013 the unicameral. The unicameral is also uniquely nonpartisan. Electors do not need to have a party affiliation to vote for state Legislature in the primary election. Because the electors in Nebraska can be nonpartisan and still vote for state Legislature in the primary election, they too must be able to vote for House of Representatives and Senate in the primary election. In light of Tashjian and AG Opinion 87070, the Legislature amended state election laws to allow nonpartisans to vote in partisan congressional primaries, resulting in the present-day language found in \u00a732-912.\n\nBeyond the requirement that nonpartisan voters be entitled to vote for congressional offices in the primaries, political parties also have the option to fully open their partisan primaries to nonpartisan voters.",

        "text": "Younger votes still lean toward Biden \u2014 but it\u2019s complicated \u2014 Harvard Gazette\nNew IOP poll shows they still plan to show up to vote but are subject to \u2018seismic mood swings\u2019 over specific issues\n\nYounger voters turned out in historic numbers to help lift Joe Biden past Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election. This year, the match-up is the same, but the feelings are much more complicated.\n\nGen Z and late Millennial voters (ages 18-29) are more dissatisfied with their choices and worried over kitchen table issues such as inflation and housing. But most still support Biden over Trump, contrary to some earlier polls, and they do still intend to make their voices heard in November, according to a new Harvard Youth Poll released Thursday.\n\nJohn Della Volpe, the IOP\u2019s longtime polling director, said he sees \u201cseismic mood swings\u201d in the results as young people feel \u201cangst\u201d over a host of issues.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re deeply concerned \u2026 about the direction of the country. They are deeply concerned about their own economic well-being, the cost of housing, inflation, [the] day-to-day cost of living. They\u2019re concerned about conflicts around the world,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at the same time, the choice between Donald Trump and Joe Biden isn\u2019t necessarily close.\u201d\n\nThe poll surveyed just over 2,000 Americans nationwide between the ages of 18 and 29 from March 14-21. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.02 points. Launched in 2000, the Harvard Youth Poll is the largest political survey of young Americans and is administered by the Harvard Public Opinion Project, an undergraduate-run organization.\n\nIn a head-to-head matchup, Biden leads Trump by eight points (45 percent-37 percent). Among those most likely to vote, his lead expands to 19 points (56 percent-37 percent). That\u2019s considerably smaller than Biden\u2019s advantage in spring 2020 when he was up by 23 points among all young voters and 30 points among likely voters.\n\nWhen third-party and independent candidates Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Jill Stein, and Cornel West are included, Biden\u2019s lead over Trump shrinks from 19 to 13 points among likely voters.\n\nTrump enjoys significant enthusiasm (76 percent) from those who already favor him but can\u2019t seem to garner more than 37 percent of support from young voters.\n\nThe outcome of his current criminal trial in New York City, however, could damage that support.\n\nTrump has been charged with falsifying business records to conceal an extramarital affair in 2016 in a case prosecuted by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg \u201995, J.D. \u201999. The survey showed that if Trump is found guilty, Biden would get a nine-point bump among likely voters and a 10-point bump among all young people.\n\nAsked whether the country is on the right or wrong track, more than half (58 percent) said the wrong track, and nearly one-third were unsure. Only 9 percent said the country is moving in the right direction, the first time this number was in the single digits in the poll\u2019s 24-year history, organizers said. Four years ago, 21 percent said the nation was headed in the right direction.\n\nSome Democrats have voiced concerns that significant numbers of young voters, dissatisfied with their election choices, might sit out the 2024 election. According to the poll, 53 percent say they\u2019ll \u201cdefinitely\u201d vote this fall, compared to 54 percent who said the same and did so in numbers that helped propel Biden to victory in 2020.\n\nPoll results showed that two issues closely associated with under-30 voters \u2014 the Israel-Hamas war and student debt relief \u2014 may not be especially consequential ones when it comes to casting votes.\n\nBiden gets good marks (39 percent) for his efforts to reduce student debt, and poor marks for his handling of the war in Gaza (18 percent). But young people ranked these as least important among the issues facing the country. The majority said inflation, healthcare, and housing were the top three matters, followed by gun violence, according to the poll.\n\nConfidence in the nation\u2019s institutions has plummeted among younger Americans over the last two election cycles. Since 2015, trust in the presidency has dropped 60 points and in the Supreme Court by 55. Wall Street (9 percent) and the media (10 percent) are trusted least, but even the U.S. military, once considered largely above doubt, is now trusted by only 36 percent surveyed.",

        "text": "Kennedy family members endorse Biden over RFK Jr.\nMore than a dozen members of the Kennedy family endorsed President Joe Biden for a second term Thursday, passing over family member Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\n\"We want to make crystal clear our feeling that the best way forward for America is to re-elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to four more years,\" Kerry Kennedy said in remarks announcing the endorsement at a campaign event in Philadelphia.\n\nShe made the endorsement on behalf of 15 Kennedy family members at the Martin Luther King Recreation Center alongside five of RFK Jr.\u2019s other siblings: Rory Kennedy, Joseph Kennedy II, Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, Christopher Kennedy and Maxwell Kennedy Sr.\n\nThe Kennedy family has stepped up its involvement in the Biden campaign, working to lift Biden's odds as Democrats worry that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s bid could pose a spoiler risk that could hand the election to former President Donald Trump.\n\nFormer Rep. Joseph Kennedy III, the independent candidate\u2019s nephew, said in an interview that he believes his uncle\u2019s \u201ccandidacy poses a threat to the country that I love and the values that I hold.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe that his candidacy is likely to divert support away from President Biden and end up increasing support for Donald Trump,\u201d he said.\n\nKerry Kennedy Jason Kempin / Getty Images file\n\nThe endorsement has been \u201cmonths in the making,\u201d according to a source familiar with the Biden campaign\u2019s planning, who added that family members came forward to \u201cdo something to show they\u2019re united by the president.\"\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. said on X: \"I hear some of my family will be endorsing President Biden today. I am pleased they are politically active \u2014 it\u2019s a family tradition. We are divided in our opinions but united in our love for each other.\"\n\nKennedy claimed that \"many of my family members are working on and supportive of\" his presidential bid but did not specify which ones.\n\nJoseph Kennedy III, who now serves in the Biden administration as special envoy to Northern Ireland, said the family endorsement is intended to blunt third-party support that could \u201csiphon votes\u201d from the president.\n\n\u201cWe want to be able to make that case not just for the risk that Bobby\u2019s candidacy shows but because of who Joe Biden is, what Joe Biden has done and what Joe Biden will do with four more years in office,\" he said.\n\nJoseph Kennedy III acknowledged \u201cchallenging\u201d feelings involved in the endorsement while noting that \u201cit\u2019s something we believe has to be done.\u201d\n\n\u201cBobby knows that we stand by him as a family member, while also being able to clearly communicate that his candidacy poses a risk to the country that we love,\u201d the younger Kennedy said.\n\nKerry Kennedy appeared to echo that sentiment in her speech Thursday.\n\n\u201cWe can say today, with no less urgency, that our rights and freedoms are once again in peril,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is why we all need to come together in a campaign that should unite not only Democrats but all Americans, including Republicans and independents who believe in what Lincoln called the better angels of our nature.\u201d\n\nKerry Kennedy directly attacked Trump and invoked her father, Robert F. Kennedy.\n\n\"I can only imagine how Donald Trump\u2019s outrageous lies and behavior would've horrified my father, Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, who proudly served as attorney general of the United States and honored his pledge to uphold the law and protect the country,\" she said before she compared her father's commitment to equal justice and human rights to Biden's.\n\nIn his own remarks, Biden called it an \u201cincredible honor to have the support of the Kennedy family.\u201d\n\nBiden also joined members of the Kennedy family at a grassroots organizing event where he was introduced by Joseph Kennedy III. The president delivered remarks to local supporters and volunteers.\n\nThe campaign said members of the Kennedy family are also taking part in voter outreach by making calls and knocking on doors.\n\nMembers of the Kennedy family have praised Biden and boosted images of family members posing with him, such as a St. Patrick's Day photo depicting three generations of the Kennedy family with him.\n\nLikewise, Biden describes Robert F. Kennedy as a political hero \"who inspired him early in his career to leave corporate law to become a public defender, and then go on to run for public office,\" the Biden campaign said. Biden also has a bust of the elder Kennedy in the Oval Office.\n\nSome members of the family have been more direct in their criticism of Robert Kennedy Jr., such as when Stephen Kennedy Smith referred on social media to what he called his cousin's \"misguided stands on issues, his poor judgement, and tenuous relationship with the truth.\u201d\n\nRory Kennedy said in an MSNBC interview this month: \"I love my brother, and it pains me to come out against him. But I am very concerned with the stakes in this election.\"\n\n\"I'm concerned that his campaign and running for office as an independent is going to lead to Trump's election,\" she added.\n\nRobert Kennedy Jr. responded to family members' criticism of his campaign this month, telling CNN's Erin Burnett, \"I don't know anybody in America who's got a family who agrees with them on everything.\" He has reiterated that he loves his family and that he understands \"why they don't like me running.\"\n\nThe campaign intentionally kept the event to immediate family members, such as several of the candidate\u2019s siblings, a member of the large political family said.\n\nThe family member referred to how RFK Jr. has previously deflected questions about his family\u2019s criticisms of his campaign.\n\n\u201cThe message is crystal clear that Bobby\u2019s own brothers and sisters are endorsing the president,\u201d the person said.\n\nJoseph Kennedy III was sympathetic to the security concerns that his uncle has raised regarding his denied request for Secret Service protection. The younger Kennedy said he was not aware of the specific threat assessments, but \u201cI would want my uncle, just like anybody else that\u2019s running for office, to make sure that they have the safety and security that they need to be able to run a campaign.\u201d\n\nPolling indicates that Biden and Trump are headed for a neck-and-neck race \u2014 and a high-profile third-party candidate, such as Kennedy, could further shake up both candidates' prospects. If the presidential election were held in March and the candidates were Biden, Trump and Kennedy, Kennedy would get about 16% of the vote, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll.",

        "text": "Anthony Scaramucci on the US election and what happens if ex-boss Donald Trump wins\nAnthony Scaramucci is part of a long conga line of people who worked in Donald Trump's White House and then turned on their former boss.\n\nScaramucci had a very brief tenure as White House communications director in 2017, and after what he saw from inside and outside Trump-world, he doesn't mince words.\n\nTrump was a \"disaster\", someone who \"didn't do the homework\", an \"impetuous\" leader \"reeling from one potential crisis to the next\", he tells ABC RN's Global Roaming.\n\nPerhaps his biggest zinger: The 45th president was \"an orange wrecking ball\".\n\nAnd although some recent polls show a neck-and-neck race between Joe Biden and Donald Trump in November's US election, Scaramucci believes Trump will lose \u2014 and lose soundly.\n\nBut should Trump prevail, \"The Mooch\" has a warning for America and the world.\n\n\"[Trump is] an incredibly dangerous guy. I'm a lifelong Republican [but] I'll be working very hard against him over the next seven months,\" he says.\n\nThe campaign ahead\n\nScaramucci, who has a background on Wall Street, was tapped for the White House communications director role in July 2017.\n\nThe high-energy Italian-American was famously fired after 11 days.\n\nScaramucci soured on Trump, voiced support for Democrat Joe Biden in the 2020 election and is doing so once again ahead of the 2024 election.\n\nListen to the podcast Challenging, thoughtful and fun, Global Roaming is your user's guide to what the world is talking about.\n\nHe says Biden has two key issues that will help him keep the White House: Reproductive rights and the spectre of the January 6 attack on the US Capitol.\n\nIt was Trump-appointed Supreme Court justices who helped overturn Roe v Wade in 2022, ending Americans' constitutional right to abortion. Since then, the issue has been left to individual US states, meaning it's legal in some and banned or restricted in others.\n\nThis may also have repercussions in the IVF sector, after an Alabama court ruled in February that frozen embryos are children, and people could be held legally responsible if they are destroyed. In the fallout, Trump voiced his support for IVF.\n\nScaramucci says this will be a major campaign theme for Biden and the Democrats.\n\n\"The largest voting bloc now [is] independents [those voters not registered as either Democrat or Republican] \u2026 [Trump's] got to win independents to get to the presidency. And most of those independents are pro-choice,\" he says.\n\nScaramucci adds it's worth remembering that in the 2022 midterm elections: \"Biden did better than almost every one of his predecessors ... primarily because Republicans are trying to repeal abortion rights.\"\n\nAnthony Scaramucci has gone from Trump supporter to ardent Trump critic. (AP: Pablo Martinez Monsivais)\n\nHe also points to the January 6 attack on the US Capitol.\n\n\"People are going to be reminded that [Trump] is the sore loser, that he wanted to rip up the Constitution of the United States,\" Scaramucci says.\n\n\"The election lie that [Trump] fomented, which led to the violence, is a sign of who he really is and I think [Democrats] are going to spend countless dollars on that.\"\n\nScaramucci doesn't have the strongest record at calling elections. After being fired, but before turning on his ex-boss, he predicted a Trump landslide in the 2020 election, before backflipping and later predicting a Biden landslide.\n\nBut as the 2024 campaign ramps up, Scaramucci thinks Biden will pull ahead and Trump will \"be very soundly defeated at the ballot box come November\".\n\nMoney, money, money\n\nWinning the US presidency is a costly task and this time around, Biden has been continually out-fundraising Trump. This is one barometer of support in the US electorate.\n\nTrump is $75 million behind Biden and has 270,000 fewer unique donors compared to this point at the 2020 election, according to an analysis by the Financial Times.\n\nTrump's four criminal indictments have also affected his haul, as the former president has been spending millions of dollars of donor money on legal bills.\n\n\"[Trump] has money worries,\" Scaramucci says.\n\nDonald Trump is standing trial for allegedly covering up hush money payments. (Reuters: Angela Weiss)\n\nHowever, more money, and the greater resources that come with it, do not always mean electoral success.\n\nIn 2016, Democrat Hillary Clinton significantly out-raised Trump, both through her campaign and other avenues.\n\nAnd Trump would be the first person to point out who won that election.\n\nThe Biden presidency\n\nAside from eviscerating his former boss, Scaramucci has some thoughts on his Democratic successor.\n\n\"Joe Biden looks like he's got one foot on a banana peel and the other foot in a casket,\" he says.\n\n\"But I think that appearance allows people to underestimate how legislatively successful Mr Biden has been.\"\n\nAnthony Scaramucci thinks Joe Biden will win the 2024 election. (AP: Alex Brandon)\n\nScaramucci thinks that over the campaign, Biden and the Democrats will become better at \"explaining to people the legislative accomplishments\" of the current administration.\n\nFor example, \"the re-shoring of manufacturing, the building of [computer] chips facilities here in the US, and other things that he's done to raise living standards\", Scaramucci says.\n\nAnd he says that Biden will have \"a tremendous amount of money to explain that narrative, come November\".\n\n\"[The campaign should] also point out that inflation was primarily driven by monetary and fiscal policy that took place during COVID. And we're now starting to see the inflation trend lines go down.\"\n\nTrump: The sequel\n\nScaramucci was only in the White House for less than a fortnight, but he claims that he saw levels of chaos and dysfunction that left him reeling.\n\nAfter his departure, Trump and Scaramucci \u2014 both gifted in the art of insults \u2014 had a number of public sparring matches, with Trump calling Scaramucci a \"nut job\" who \"unfortunately wheedled his way into my campaign\".\n\nThe Mooch was just \"another disgruntled former employee who got fired for gross incompetence!\", according to one Trump tweet.\n\nFrom within Trump-world, Scaramucci faced accusations of attention-seeking and opportunism, with Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel saying he was only attacking Trump \"for his own personal gain\".\n\nBut should Trump end up winning the 2024 election, Scaramucci thinks the sequel will be worse than Trump's first presidency.\n\n\"Those people that stopped Trump's anarchy and destruction [during his first term] are not going to be with him in the second term,\" he says.\n\n\"[Trump will be] way more organised this time, and way more prepared \u2026 He'll want to expand executive power \u2026 I do see democracy at risk.\"\n\nSo which policies in particular worry Scaramucci?\n\nHe slams Trump's isolationist trade policies, which he claims hark back to a bygone time in America \"with very little imports coming into the country, very little exports\".\n\n\"[This] will weaken the global trading system. While the United States, which is abundant with natural resources, could potentially survive, it would cripple the global economy.\"\n\nStream your favourite shows on the free ABC listen app Photo shows Image of Dr Karl on a pink background and Listen app logo Dr Karl knows the best app for free podcasts, radio, music, news and audiobooks \u2026 and you don\u2019t need to be a scientist to find it!\n\nScaramucci also warns that Trump's \"love affair\" with Russian President Vladimir Putin will mean \"he'll pull us out of NATO, he'll revoke aid to Ukraine\".\n\n\"[And] he'll be a massive deficit spender \u2026 He wants to cut more taxes, which further destabilises the US balance sheet and the US budget.\"\n\nBy Scaramucci's estimates, there are around 40 fellow Trump White House alumni \"that are denouncing him and begging the American public not to allow him to return to the presidency\".\n\n\"It's my job, alongside my friends who love the country, to put patriotism first and partisanship last, and work hard to make sure that he doesn't win,\" he says.",

        "text": "Fact check: Biden makes false and misleading claims during Pennsylvania campaign swing\nWashington CNN \u2014\n\nPresident Joe Biden spent three days this week campaigning in the critical swing state of Pennsylvania. He littered his remarks with false and misleading claims on subjects ranging from his annual earnings to his cap on seniors\u2019 prescription drug spending to the demographics of China to the frequency of his past travel to Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nAnd in Biden\u2019s most eyebrow-raising remarks of the campaign swing, he told and then retold a story in which he strongly suggested his late uncle, Ambrose Finnegan, was eaten by cannibals after his plane was shot down while he fought in World War II. Biden\u2019s dramatic details don\u2019t match the Defense Department\u2019s official account of the plane crash.\n\nHere is a fact check of eight of Biden\u2019s Pennsylvania remarks.\n\nBiden\u2019s earnings\n\nIn the same Tuesday speech in Scranton, Biden repeated his regular promise that nobody making less than $400,000 per year will pay even a cent more in taxes under his proposals. He then added, \u201cI hope you\u2019re all able to make $400,000. I never did.\u201d\n\nFacts First: Biden\u2019s \u201cI never did\u201d claim is false. In fact, his presidential salary is $400,000 per year; the joint tax filings of President Biden and first lady Jill Biden showed $619,976 in income last year, $579,514 in 2022 and $610,702 in 2021. In addition, Biden earned millions in 2017 and 2018, when, during his time as a private citizen following his vice presidency, he and Jill Biden signed a lucrative book deal and he delivered paid speeches. The Bidens\u2019 joint tax filings showed a total of about $11 million in 2017 income and about $4.6 million in 2018 income.\n\nBiden, who was a US senator for 36 years prior to his vice presidency, did regularly earn less than $400,000 per year before 2017. As PolitiFact has previously noted, the Bidens\u2019 joint filings reported less than $400,000 in income in each year from 1998 through 2016 except for 2013, when they were just over $407,000.\n\nBiden\u2019s cap on seniors\u2019 prescription drug spending\n\nIn the same speech in Scranton, Biden touted provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act he signed in 2022. He said: \u201cFor example, seniors, beginning in 2024, no matter how much their prescription drug costs are, they\u2019ll never have to pay more than $2,000 a year, no matter what.\u201d\n\nFacts First: Biden\u2019s claim is false in two ways. First, the $2,000 cap on Medicare Part D enrollees\u2019 out-of-pocket prescription drug spending takes effect in 2025, not 2024; there is a higher cap, more than $3,000, in place this year. (The White House corrected the official transcript of Biden\u2019s speech to make clear Biden should have said 2025 instead of 2024.) Second, it\u2019s not true that seniors will \u201cnever\u201d have to spend more than $2,000 per year on prescription drugs \u201cno matter what.\u201d The cap is indexed to annual inflation in Part D costs, so it is highly likely to be set higher than $2,000 in future years. Also, the cap doesn\u2019t apply to out-of-pocket spending on Medicare Part B drugs like those administered at doctors\u2019 offices.\n\nBiden has correctly said on various previous occasions that the $2,000 cap takes effect in 2025, but he has also previously incorrectly said that the cap took effect in 2023 or 2024.\n\n- CNN\u2019s Tami Luhby contributed to this item.\n\nChina\u2019s demographics\n\nIn a Wednesday speech in Pittsburgh that was focused on US steel competition with China, Biden said, \u201cI always say to my colleagues \u2014 when I meet other world leaders, I say, \u2018Would you trade places with China? Would you trade places with their problems?\u2019 They\u2019ve got a population that is more people in retirement than working.\u201d\n\nFacts First: The claim that China has more retired people than working people is false. Fuxian Yi, a University of Wisconsin-Madison senior scientist who is an expert on Chinese demographics, called Biden\u2019s claim \u201coverstated and premature.\u201d\n\nChina reported having more than 740 million employed people at the end of 2023, while it also reported having just shy of 297 million people age 60 or above that year. (Sixty is the normal retirement-benefits age for Chinese men; it\u2019s 50 to 55 for women depending on the nature of their jobs.) And some of the 60-plus population is still working.\n\nYi noted that China\u2019s ratio of working people to seniors is shrinking as the country\u2019s population ages. But Biden\u2019s claim that the number of retirees already exceeds the number of people working is clearly not correct, even if you apply the usual dose of skepticism to official Chinese data.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly the direction they\u2019re heading, but still an exaggeration,\u201d Derek Scissors, a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute think tank who is an expert on the Chinese economy, said of Biden\u2019s claim.\n\nBiden made a similar claim in 2021, which CNN fact-checked as false at the time.\n\nBiden\u2019s corporate minimum tax\n\nAs he has on numerous previous occasions, Biden cited a 2021 report from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy think tank that found that 55 of the country\u2019s largest corporations had made more than $40 billion in total profit in their previous fiscal year but not paid any federal corporate income taxes.\n\nBiden said in the same Tuesday speech in Scranton: \u201cWhen Trump was president in 2020, 55 of the largest corporations in America of the Fortune 500 made $40 billion in profit and paid zero \u2014 zero \u2014 in federal income taxes.\u201d After someone in the audience called that \u201csinful,\u201d Biden continued, \u201cWell, guess what? I came along and took care of the sin. Not anymore. Thanks to the law that I wrote and signed, big corporations now have to pay a minimum \u2014 they should be paying more \u2014 a minimum of 15% tax.\u201d\n\nFacts First: Biden\u2019s \u201cnot anymore\u201d claim is false \u2014 the same exaggeration he delivered in his State of the Union address in March. While the 15% corporate minimum tax he signed into law in the Inflation Reduction Act will reduce the number of big corporations that don\u2019t pay any federal taxes, it\u2019s not true that \u201cnot anymore\u201d will any big corporation \u2014 such as the ones on the list of 55 companies Biden mentioned \u2014 ever do so. That\u2019s because the minimum tax, on the \u201cbook income\u201d companies report to investors, only applies to companies with at least $1 billion in average annual income. According to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, only 14 of the companies on that 2021 list of 55 non-payers reported having US pre-tax income of at least $1 billion.\n\nIn other words, there will clearly still be some big and profitable corporations paying no federal income tax despite the existence of the new Biden tax. The exact number is not known.\n\nMatthew Gardner, a senior fellow at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, told CNN in 2022 that the new tax is \u201can important step forward from the status quo\u201d and that it would raise substantial revenue, but he also said: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to assert that the minimum tax will end the phenomenon of zero-tax profitable corporations. A more accurate phrasing would be to say that the minimum tax will *help* ensure that *the most profitable* corporations pay at least some federal income tax.\u201d\n\nThere are lots of nuances to the tax; you can read more specifics here. Asked for comment in early 2023, when Biden made a similar claim, a White House official told CNN: \u201cThe Inflation Reduction Act ensures the wealthiest corporations pay a 15% minimum tax, precisely the corporations the President focused on during the campaign and in office.\u201d\n\nBillionaires and taxes\n\nBiden delivered another version of a claim he has regularly made about billionaires\u2019 tax rates. He said in the same Tuesday speech in Scranton: \u201cDo you know what the average federal tax rate for a billionaire is today in America? For real: 8.3%.\u201d After some people in the audience laughed, Biden continued, \u201cThat\u2019s how much federal ta- \u2014 no, I\u2019m serious. Not a joke. Far less than the vast majority of Americans pay in federal taxes. No billionaire should pay a lower tax rate than a teacher, a nurse, a sanitation worker.\u201d\n\nFacts First: Biden\u2019s \u201c8.3%\u201d claim is misleading in the absence of any explanation of what this figure is. As in previous speeches, including the State of the Union address in March, Biden didn\u2019t explain that the figure is the product of an alternative calculation, from economists in his own administration, that factors in unrealized capital gains that are not treated as taxable income under federal law. In other words, while Biden made it sound like he was talking about a federal tax rate, he was actually citing a figure that is not based on the way the US tax system actually works at present.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with the alternative calculation itself; the administration economists who came up with it explained it in detail on the White House website in 2021. (They said the figure was 8.2%.) Biden, however, has tended to cite the figure without any context about what it is and isn\u2019t, leaving open the impression that he was talking about what these billionaire families pay under current law.\n\nSo what do billionaires actually pay under current law? The answer is not publicly known, but experts say it\u2019s clearly more than 8%.\n\n\u201cBiden\u2019s numbers are way too low,\u201d Howard Gleckman, senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center at the Urban Institute think tank, told CNN in 2023. Gleckman said that in 2019, University of California, Berkeley economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman \u201cestimated the top 400 households paid an average effective tax rate of about 23 percent in 2018. They got a lot of attention at the time because that rate was lower than the average rate of 24 percent for the bottom half of the income distribution. But it still was way more than 2 or 3,\u201d numbers Biden has used in some previous speeches, \u201cor even 8 percent.\u201d\n\nIn February 2024, Gleckman provided additional calculations from the Tax Policy Center. The center found that the top 0.1% of households paid an average effective federal tax rate of about 30.3% in 2020, including an average income tax rate of 24.3%.\n\nBiden and the budget deficit\n\nDuring the same Tuesday speech in Scranton, Biden repeated a familiar boast about his supposed impact on the federal budget deficit. He said, \u201cA lot more to do, but guess what? During the whole time, I\u2019ve been able to cut the federal deficit at the same exact time by over $1 trillion \u2014 $1 trillion.\u201d\n\nFacts First: Biden\u2019s claim leaves out such critical context that it is misleading. While the annual federal budget deficit was more than $1 trillion lower in the 2023 fiscal year than it was in both the 2020 fiscal year (under President Donald Trump) and the 2021 fiscal year (partially under Trump and partially under Biden), analysts have repeatedly noted that Biden\u2019s own actions, including laws he has signed and executive orders he has issued, have had the overall effect of worsening annual deficits, not reducing them. As in past remarks, Biden didn\u2019t explain that the primary reason the deficit fell by a record amount during his tenure was that it had skyrocketed to a record high at the end of Trump\u2019s term because of bipartisan emergency pandemic relief spending, then fell as expected when that spending expired as planned.\n\n\u201cThe deficit is a trillion dollars lower, roughly, than when President Biden took office. That\u2019s true. But that\u2019s driven not because he \u2018reduced\u2019 the deficit by a trillion dollars, but because when he took office it was the middle of Covid and we had been temporarily injecting huge sums of money into the economy,\u201d Marc Goldwein, senior vice president at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, an advocacy group that promotes deficit reduction and tracks the issue, said in a February interview.\n\nBiden can fairly say that his policies have contributed to a strong economic recovery that has boosted tax revenues and thus eaten into deficits. On the whole, though, Goldwein said deficits under Biden have been \u201chigher than they otherwise would have been because of legislation President Biden has signed into law and executive actions he\u2019s taken.\u201d\n\nBiden made the same claim during his State of the Union address in March. You can read a more detailed fact check here.\n\nBiden\u2019s visits to Iraq and Afghanistan\n\nBiden claimed in another Tuesday speech in Scranton: \u201cI was in, I think, 36, 38 times in Iraq and Afghanistan as a senator and as a vice president.\u201d\n\nFacts First: These figures are false, according to statistics previously released by Biden\u2019s own 2020 presidential campaign. The campaign said in 2019 that Biden had visited Iraq and Afghanistan on a total of 21 occasions, the Washington Post reported at the time.\n\nBiden has delivered similar falsehoods about his travel to Iraq and Afghanistan on various previous occasions \u2014 including in the 2019 remarks that prompted his campaign to correct the record \u2014 and they have been previously fact-checked by media outlets including CNN.\n\nBiden\u2019s uncle in World War II\n\nIn Scranton, where Biden was born, he visited a memorial that honors local residents who died in World War II, including his late uncle Ambrose Finnegan. Before Biden left the city on Wednesday, he told a dramatic story about Finnegan: \u201cHe got shot down in an area where there were a lot of cannibals in New Guinea at the time. They never recovered his body.\u201d He blamed cannibalism even more directly in his Pittsburgh speech later in the day, claiming Finnegan \u201cgot shot down in New Guinea, and they never found the body because there used to be \u2014 there were a lot of cannibals, for real, in that part of New Guinea.\u201d\n\nFacts First: Biden\u2019s claim differs from the account provided by the Defense Department, as CNN\u2019s Donald Judd reported Wednesday. The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency\u2019s page on Finnegan says this about the 1944 incident: \u201cFor unknown reasons, this plane was forced to ditch in the ocean off the north coast of New Guinea. Both engines failed at low altitude, and the aircraft\u2019s nose hit the water hard. Three men failed to emerge from the sinking wreck and were lost in the crash.\u201d This official account, which notes that an additional crew member survived the crash, makes no mention of the plane being shot down or of possible cannibalism; while Biden said the crash happened \u201cin\u201d New Guinea, where there was indeed some cannibalism at the time, the official account notes the men went down in the nearby ocean.\n\nWhite House spokespeople did not repeat Biden\u2019s assertions about cannibals or the plane being shot down when asked about his story. \u201cPresident Biden is proud of his uncle\u2019s service in uniform, who lost his life when the military aircraft he was on crashed in the Pacific after taking off near New Guinea,\u201d deputy press secretary Andrew Bates told CNN on Wednesday.\n\n- CNN\u2019s Donald Judd contributed to this item.",

        "text": "Trump is funneling campaign money into cash-strapped businesses. Experts say it looks bad.\nDonald Trump\u2019s main 2024 White House campaign fundraising operation sharply increased spending at the former president's properties in recent months, funneling money into his businesses at a time when he is facing serious legal jeopardy and desperately needs cash.\n\nTrump\u2019s joint fundraising committee wrote three checks in February and one in March to his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, totaling $411,287 and another in March to Trump National Doral Miami for $62,337, according to a report filed to the Federal Election Commission this week.\n\nFederal law and FEC regulations allow donor funds to be spent at a candidate\u2019s business so long as the campaign pays fair market value, experts say. Trump has been doing it for years, shifting millions in campaign cash into his sprawling business empire to pay for expenses such as using his personal aircraft for political events, rent at Trump Tower and events at his properties, which has included hotels and private clubs.\n\nWhile the practice is legal, some campaign finance experts believe it raises ethical concerns when a candidate is generating personal revenue off running for office.\n\nTrump trial live updates:David Pecker expected to be first witness in hush money trial\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\n\u201cWhen voters see something like this happening it contributes to their distrust of the political system and their elected officials' motives,\u201d said Shanna Ports, senior legal counsel with the Campaign Legal Center, a nonprofit government accountability group.\n\nTrump faces huge legal costs amid multiple civil and criminal cases\n\nThe money Trump\u2019s campaign is spending at his businesses could help the former president as he faces a big cash crunch.\n\nTrump has been hit with a pair of large financial judgements after losing two civil lawsuits.\n\nHe posted a $91.6 million bond in a defamation case brought by the writer E. Jean Carroll, and a $175 million bond in a fraud case involving falsifying business records. The New York attorney general is challenging whether the deal Trump made to post the larger bond payment is financially sound.\n\nThe payments Trump\u2019s campaign has made to his businesses are small compared to his large court-ordered financial judgements, but have been growing in recent months.\n\nThe Trump campaign and affiliated political committees paid businesses owned by Trump at least $4.9 million since the start of 2023, according to an analysis by USA TODAY. Most of that money \u2013 $4.1 million \u2013 went to TAG Air, Inc. for air travel.\n\nTrump lists TAG Air, Inc among his assets on his latest financial disclosure required of presidential candidates, with a value of between $5 million and $25 million. It operates his private aircraft, nicknamed Trump Force One.\n\nTrump's various campaign committees and a super PAC controlled by his supporters also spent at least $809,000 at his properties since the beginning of last year.\n\nCampaign spending at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Doral in Miami\n\nThe bulk of the campaign spending at Trump's properties since the start of 2023 \u2014 $663,000 \u2014 has been at Mar-a-Lago, and most of it occurred in February. It\u2019s not clear what events the money went toward.\n\nA Trump spokeswoman did not respond to specific questions about the campaign spending at his properties but instead sent a statement attacking President Joe Biden.\n\nOther GOP candidates also have been spending considerable campaign cash at Trump properties.\n\nOhio Republican U.S. Senate candidate Bernie Moreno's campaign spent $109,000 on \"event catering\" at Mar-a-Lago in April, December and January of 2023, records show. Trump endorsed Moreno in December. Moreno won the primary in March and will face three-term Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown in November.\n\nNevada U.S. Senate candidate Jim Marchant's campaign spent about $67,000 at Mar-a-Lago on \"event venue rental and catering\" in November and December. Trump backed Marchant in his unsuccessful bid to be Nevada's secretary of state in 2022. Marchant is now seeking to unseat first-term Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen.\n\nA PAC called Giuliani Defense spent $2,400 on fundraising expenses and food at Trump's golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey in January. That PAC has spent $540,000 on legal fees, according to FEC filings. Trump hosted a fundraiser for Rudy Giuliani at Bedminster in September to help with the former New York mayor's legal costs, which stem in part from the criminal charges Giuliani faces in Fulton County, Georgia, for trying to help Trump overturn the 2020 election.\n\nTrump hosted a party at Mar-a-Lago on March 5 with a large group of supporters to watch the Super Tuesday primary election results from 16 states. He also held a fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago in October that drew hundreds of supporters, including U.S. Reps Marjorie Taylor Green and Byron Donalds, Texas attorney general Ken Paxton and the actress Roseanne Barr.\n\nAnother fundraiser at Trump National Doral in March was hosted by former Ambassador Carlos Trujillo, with the money benefiting the Make America Great Again, Inc. super PAC.\n\nThe Trump Save America Joint Fundraising Committee, which raises money for Trump\u2019s campaign and his Save America leadership PAC accounted for the majority of the spending at Trump properties, with other expenses paid for by Trump\u2019s main campaign committee, the MAGA Inc. super PAC and Save America.\n\nConcerns about Trump's business conflicts go back to 2016 election\n\nQuestions about how Trump\u2019s businesses have benefited from his political career have swirled around him throughout the former president\u2019s three campaigns and his four years in the White House.\n\nUnder pressure to avoid potential conflicts of interest between his role as president and his vast business dealings, Trump declared after winning the 2016 election that he wouldn't cut any \"new deals.\" The incoming president also put his two adult sons in charge of the family business, which was controlled by a trust that critics said didn't have strong enough requirements to prevent potential ethical conflicts.\n\nLawsuits accusing Trump of violating the emoluments clauses in the Constitution during his presidency were unsuccessful. Critics said those seeking to influence Trump's administration funneled money into his businesses, including a hotel near the White House in Washington, D.C. that has since been sold and rebranded as a Waldorf Astoria.\n\nAmerica Democracy Legal Fund filed a complaint with the FEC in 2016 alleging \u201cMr. Trump is using funds from his presidential campaign to further his business and personal interests.\" The complaint was dismissed, but concerns remain in the minds of some campaign finance experts.\n\n\"People should be running for office because they want to serve the public, not because they want to enrich themselves,\" Ports said. \"So the fact that campaigns are allowed to pay the candidate\u2019s business raises those concerns. While legal, it creates kind of a negative impression of the election system.\"\n\nRichard Briffault, a legislation professor at Columbia Law School, said Trump's use of campaign funds at his businesses may not be illegal, but it's \"a little bit dicey.\"\n\n'Nobody's ever seen anything like it'\n\nBriffault said the only comparable political candidate with such a sprawling business may be former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who ran for president as a Democrat, but even then, they\u2019re not an exact comparison. \u201cEverything with Trump, nobody\u2019s ever seen anything like it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe primary thing Trump\u2019s businesses need to do is charge his campaign and PACs the same amount they would charge any other paying customer for the services. But there\u2019s also an ethical question of whether the campaign and PACs could get a better deal somewhere else.\n\n\u201cHow much are they charging? And to what extent are they putting people up who might be staying someplace else that might be cheaper?\u201d Briffault asked. \u201cYou could imagine that there could be cheaper venues to these things, but they\u2019re purposely holding them there.\u201d\n\nTrump's leadership PAC also has been spending vast sums on attorneys as the president faces four criminal cases. He currently is on trial in New York City in a case involving alleged payments to an adult film star during the 2016 presidential campaign to keep her quiet about an alleged sexual affair.\n\nSince days after the 2020 election, the leadership PAC Save America spent more than $72.5 million on legal bills to many of the same firms that are representing him in his civil and criminal cases.

        "text": "WATCH: Biden accepts endorsements from Kennedy family members at campaign event in Philadelphia\nPHILADELPHIA (AP) \u2014 President Joe Biden scooped up endorsements from at least 15 members of the Kennedy political family during a campaign stop Thursday as he aims to undermine Donald Trump and marginalize the candidacy of independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nWatch the event in the player above.\n\nKerry Kennedy, a daughter of former Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, niece of former President John F. Kennedy and sister of the current presidential candidate, delivered the endorsements in Philadelphia by calling Biden \u201cmy hero.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want to make crystal clear our feelings that the best way forward for America is to reelect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris for four more years,\u201d she said.\n\nShe never directly mentioned her brother, but insisted \u201cthere are only two candidates with any chance of winning the presidency\u201d this year, framing the campaign as a choice between Biden and Trump, with no room for a third party contender.\n\nBiden, who keeps a bust of Robert F. Kennedy in the Oval Office, said the endorsements were \u201can incredible honor.\u201d He said Trump, the former president who is the presumptive Republican nominee, was a threat to America\u2019s democratic traditions and that \u201cnow it\u2019s time to keep going and not slow down because there\u2019s so much at stake.\u201d\n\nThe decision to highlight the Kennedy family\u2019s support more than six months from Election Day is an indication of how seriously Biden\u2019s team is taking a long shot candidate using his last name\u2019s lingering Democratic magic to siphon support from the incumbent.\n\nKennedy Jr. played down the endorsements, writing on social media that his family was \u201cdivided in our opinions but united in our love for each other.\u201d He said his campaign was about \u201chealing America.\u201d\n\nGiven Kennedy Jr.\u2019s quixotic political positions and the expectation this year\u2019s campaign will be decided by thin margins, both Democrats and Republicans worry that he could be a spoiler. As a reminder of that potentially decisive role, officials in Michigan said Kennedy qualified for the state ballot on Thursday.\n\nBiden used Thursday\u2019s event, which capped a three-day swing in Pennsylvania, to keep up the pressure on Trump.\n\nWATCH: Independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr. picks Nicole Shanahan as his 2024 running mate\n\n\u201cDonald Trump\u2019s vision is one of anger, hate, revenge and retribution,\u201d Biden said, adding, \u201cI have a very different view of America, one of hope and optimism.\u201d\n\nAfter the event, Biden thanked about three dozen supporters and volunteers who were gearing up to call voters or knock on doors for his campaign.\n\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re doing here is bigger than me, bigger than you, bigger than all of us combined. It\u2019s about what kind of country our kids are going to live in,\u201d Biden said.\n\nHe portrayed the election as less about keeping himself in office than keeping Trump out, saying the race was important \u201cnot because I\u2019m running\u201d but because of \u201cwhat happens if we lose this election.\u201d\n\nThe Kennedy family endorsements are hardly a surprise. Members of the prominent Democratic family have been vocal that they don\u2019t see eye to eye politically with Kennedy Jr., who started as a protest primary challenger to Biden in the Democratic Party and now is running as an independent. Biden last month hosted more than 30 members of Kennedy\u2019s extended family at the White House for St. Patrick\u2019s Day, when family members posed with the president in the Rose Garden and Oval Office.\n\nLater, Biden and members of the Kennedy family were to meet with supporters at a campaign event, and some Kennedy were planning to make calls to voters and knock on doors on Biden\u2019s behalf.\n\nSeveral notable members of the family were not endorsing, including Caroline Kennedy, the U.S. ambassador to Australia, and nonprofit leader Maria Shriver, which the Biden campaign said was due to their nonpolitical professional roles.\n\nShriver, however, has been a conspicuous White House guest recently, attending the State of the Union and speaking at a women\u2019s history month reception last month.\n\nBernard Tamas of Valdosta State University, an expert on third parties, said it was unclear whether Kennedy Jr. would pull more votes from Democrats or Republicans.\n\n\u201cHe is pro-science when it comes to the environment, but a conspiracy theorist when it comes to vaccines,\u201d Tamas said.\n\nKennedy Jr.\u2019s lack of a clear political lane limits his potential impact on the election, Tamas said, but Democrats appear to be more concerned because his last name could lead some voters to believe that he is carrying on his family\u2019s political legacy.\n\nOther than that, Tamas said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what else he has to attract progressive voters.\u201d\n\nKennedy Jr. has spoken publicly in the past about disagreeing with his family on many issues, but maintains it can be done in \u201cfriendly\u201d ways. After a super political action committee supporting his campaign produced a TV ad during the Super Bowl that relied heavily on imagery from John F. Kennedy\u2019s 1960 presidential run, Kennedy Jr. apologized to his relatives on the X social media platform, saying he was sorry if the spot \u201ccaused anyone in my family pain.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic National Committee has hired a communications team to combat the appeal of third-party candidates, Kennedy Jr. first among them. The DNC also filed a recent Federal Election Commission complaint against Kennedy Jr.\u2019s campaign, charging that it coordinated too closely with an affiliated super PAC to get his name on the presidential ballot in some states.\n\nKennedy Jr. is also viewed warily by the Trump campaign. While Trump has released a recent video saying, \u201cIf I were a Democrat, I\u2019d vote for RFK Jr. every single time over Biden,\u201d he has sometimes criticized Kennedy Jr. as being more \u201cradical left\u201d than Biden.\n\nOn his way out of town, Biden made a swing by a Wawa, accompanied by Mayor Cherelle Parker, where he picked up some food and ordered a black and white milkshake. That served to cover Biden\u2019s bases on one front, given his stop Wednesday in Pittsburgh at a Sheetz, a rival convenience chain.\n\nBiden\u2019s travels across Pennsylvania this week were an opportunity to reconnect with his roots, starting on Tuesday in Scranton, where he lived until age 10. He swung by his childhood home, a three-story colonial that his family rented, and reminisced about attending Mass at St. Paul\u2019s.\n\nIn Pittsburgh, he called for higher tariffs on steel and aluminum from China to protect U.S. industry from what he called unfair competition. But even that event involved some nostalgia, as Biden recalled an endorsement from the steelworkers when he was \u201ca 29-year-old kid\u201d from Delaware running for U.S. Senate.\n\n\u201cIt changed everything,\u201d he said.",

The new rules will take effect August 1, and will apply to complaints that occurred on or after that date . Pregnant and transgender students will be better protected under the new rules .",
        "text": "Biden finalizes Title IX rules to boost rights of sexual assault victims, LGBTQ students\nThe Biden administration on Friday finalized a long-awaited overhaul of Title IX, the decades-old federal law that protects students from sex- and gender-based discrimination.\n\nThe rules will reverse Trump-era policies that critics say for years have bolstered the rights of people accused of sexual assault on school campuses. When Joe Biden was running for president, he described his predecessors\u2019 Title IX regulations as a \"green light to ignore sexual violence and strip survivors of their rights.\u201d\n\nUnder the new policy, colleges will be allowed to use a lower standard to find someone guilty of sexual misconduct. The federal government will also raise its expectations of schools across the country by requiring them to quickly respond to all types of sex-based discrimination \u2013 not just to sexual harassment, which is the current threshold.\n\nAnd colleges will do away with a controversial requirement for live hearings, including potentially traumatic cross-examinations between victims and those they accuse of sex-based misconduct.\n\nIt\u2019s a change that victims' rights advocates have been eagerly pushing since Biden took office. The rule spent years wading through government red tape \u2013 it still hasn\u2019t fully cleared all the bureaucratic hurdles \u2013 and was announced months after the Education Department originally said it would be finalized.\n\nDemanding 'immediate action':Biden promised to reform Title IX. Students are tired of waiting\n\nThe regulations will officially expand the rights of LGBTQ students and staff, setting in stone definitions that will protect people who identify as queer and transgender from harassment or discrimination in any school that receives federal funding. Pregnant students will be better protected under the new rules, too.\n\nOn a call with reporters Thursday, top Education Department officials hailed the changes as the most comprehensive reforms of Title IX since the decades-old law was passed.\n\n\u201cUnder today\u2019s regulations, schools will have to do enough to end sex discrimination,\" said Catherine Lhamon, the agency\u2019s assistant secretary for civil rights, \"giving complete effect to the Title IX guarantee that no person shall experience sex discrimination at school.\"\n\nThe regulations will take effect Aug. 1, the Education Department said, and will apply to complaints that occurred on or after that date.\n\nThe announcement fulfills one of Biden\u2019s key campaign promises \u2013 though not until the tail end of his first term. While opponents of the Trump-era rules have praised the Biden administration for moving to reverse them, frustration at the government's pace has soured even supporters of the president's efforts. Depending on the outcome of the general election this November, a potential second Trump term would likely start the process of reversing the standards mere months after they take effect.\n\nEmma Grasso Levine, a senior manager with the survivor-led advocacy group Know Your IX, commended the administration on Friday, but warned colleges now have a lot of work to do in a short amount of time.\n\n\"Now, it\u2019s up to school administrators to act quickly to implement and enforce the updated guidance\" Levine said. \"Student survivors of sexual violence, LGBTQ+ students, and pregnant and parenting students cannot afford to suffer any longer under policies that jeopardize their right to an education.\"\n\nMany Republicans in Washington, including Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., have taken to anti-LGBTQ rhetoric in their criticisms of Biden's approach to Title IX. The conservative congresswoman on Friday accused the president of attempting to \u201cradically redefine sex and gender.\u201d\n\nThat complicated dynamic demonstrates how much of a \"political football\" the landmark 1972 law has become. In recent years, the statute's politicization has thrust the staff who enforce it at schools across the country into a state of whiplash, while students, especially those from marginalized groups, remain caught in the middle.\n\nTrans athlete rules still in limbo\n\nThe Biden administration is also separately aiming to curtail schools\u2019 abilities to prevent transgender athletes from competing in sports. In a different rule released last April, officials suggested a nuanced approach to allowing trans students to play on teams consistent with their gender identity, with some exceptions.\n\nThat rule is still in bureaucratic limbo, and Friday\u2019s announcement left questions about the administration's plans for the other timeline unanswered.\n\nThe involvement of transgender students in school sports has become a politically salient culture-war issue in recent years amid a broader conservative-led campaign to restrict the rights of people whose gender identity differs from their sex assigned at birth.\n\nAs he seeks to oust Biden this fall, former President Donald Trump has latched on to the topic, ranting about his disdain for trans athletes at his rallies.\n\nWhen asked Thursday whether concerns about the election have influenced the timeline for the regulation on trans athletes, the Education Department declined to comment.\n\nZachary Schermele covers education and breaking news for USA TODAY.

        "text": "US House approves $61bn in military aid for Ukraine after months of stalling\nAfter months of stalling, the US House of Representatives finally approved more than $61bn worth of military assistance to help Ukraine in its desperate defense against Russia, as well as billions for other allies including Israel and Taiwan.\n\nIn a bipartisan vote, 210 Democrats and 101 Republicans joined to support Ukraine, with 112 Republicans \u2013 a majority of the GOP members \u2013 voting against. It came after the Republican speaker, Mike Johnson, forced a series of bills onto the floor in the face of fierce resistance within his own Republican party, many of whom oppose spending more on Ukraine\u2019s defense.\n\nThe Senate is set to begin considering the House-passed bill on Tuesday, with some preliminary votes that afternoon. Final passage was expected sometime next week, which would clear the way for Biden to sign it into law.\n\nVoting began hours ahead of schedule in an extraordinary Saturday session that delayed the House\u2019s planned recess. The House erupted into applause when the Ukraine bill passed, with the chair, Marc Molinaro of New York, admonishing members not to wave Ukrainian flags.\n\nIn a powerful effort to sum up the stakes before the vote, the former Democratic speaker, Nancy Pelosi, made a stridently graphic appeal: \u201cI hope our colleagues will choose democracy and decency rather than autocracy and evil because I fear if you choose the Putin route, you will have blood on your hands, blood of the children, blood of their mothers raped in front of their parents, raped in front of their children,\u201d she said.\n\nVolodymyr Zelenskiy, Ukraine\u2019s president, recently warned that his country \u201cwill lose the war\u201d without US assistance, as its military has struggled with ammunition and air defense shortages and Russia has pressed a growing advantage in firepower as Congress prevaricated.\n\nImmediately after the bill passed, ZelenskIy released a statement expressing his gratitude to both parties \u201cand personally Speaker Mike Johnson for the decision that keeps history on the right track\u201d.\n\n\u201cDemocracy and freedom will always have global significance and will never fail as long as America helps to protect it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe vital US aid bill passed today by the House will keep the war from expanding, save thousands and thousands of lives, and help both of our nations to become stronger. Just peace and security can only be attained through strength. We hope that bills will be supported in the Senate and sent to President Biden\u2019s desk. Thank you, America!\u201d\n\nMembers were voting on a package worth close to $95bn in total, but which had been broken up into four separate bills, as Johnson effectively de-coupled the vote on Ukraine from funding for Israel, which is more widely supported among both Democrats and Republicans.\n\nThe vote on granting additional funding for Israel also easily passed the House, with 365 in favor and only 57 opposed: 36 Democrats and 21 Republicans.\n\nBy splitting the bill into four, Johson sought to give recalcitrant far-right members of his own GOP conference the opportunity to vote with their conscience on the parts they disliked.\n\nFirst to be voted on was a bill including legislation on border security, which failed, as expected. Many rightwing Republicans do not want the Biden administration to win credit for resolving a crisis at the US border with Mexico, where there has been an upsurge of asylum seekers, during an election year. The GOP\u2019s presumptive presidential nominee, Donald Trump, is seeking to make the border an election issue.\n\nThe $95bn in total funding includes roughly $61bn for Ukraine (with much of the funding going towards replenishing American munitions); $26bn for Israel; $8bn for US allies in the Indo-Pacific region, including Taiwan; and $9bn in humanitarian assistance for civilians in war zones, such as Haiti, Sudan and Gaza, though the package also includes a ban on direct US funding for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (Unrwa), an agency providing key assistance to Gaza, until March 2025.\n\nIn the Ukraine bill, of the $60.7bn, a total of about $23bn would be used by the US to replenish its military stockpiles, opening the door to future US military transfers to Ukraine. Another $14bn would go to the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, in which the Pentagon buys advanced new weapon systems for the Ukrainian military directly from US defense contractors.\n\n0:25 Moment US House approves $61bn military aid package to Ukraine \u2013 video\n\nThere is also more than $11bn to fund current US military operations in the region, enhancing the capabilities of the Ukrainian military and fostering intelligence collaboration between Kyiv and Washington, and about $8bn in non-military assistance, such as helping Ukraine\u2019s government continue basic operations, including the payment of salaries and pensions.\n\nSergii Marchenko, the Ukrainian finance minister, pointed to the legislation\u2019s provision for budget support.\n\n\u201cThis is the extraordinary support we need to maintain financial stability and prevail,\u201d he wrote on X.\n\nThe package largely mirrors the foreign aid proposal passed by the Senate in February, although it designates $10bn of the Ukraine funding as a repayable loan to appease some Republican members.\n\nThe Israel bill includes about $4.4bn to replenish depleted US supplies given to Israel; $4bn for missile defense, including the much-vaunted Iron Dome, and $1.2bn for the Iron Beam; and $3.5bn to help Israel buy weapons. There are also provisions to make it easier to supply Israel with US munitions held in other countries.\n\nThe bill supporting American allies in the Asia-Pacific region, chiefly Taiwan, included more than $8bn for countering Chinese activities, about $3.3bn for submarines and $2bn of military assistance to Taiwan.\n\nAnother bill included a provision to force the Chinese company ByteDance to sell its popular social media app TikTok, which Congress is worried gives China the ability to gain information about American citizens. That bill \u2013 the 21st Century Peace through Strength Act \u2013 also included the seizure of frozen Russian sovereign assets, and more sanctions on Iran.\n\nThe passed bills will be combined into a single package to simplify the voting process for the Senate, which will need to reapprove the proposal before it can go to President Joe Biden\u2019s desk for his signature.\n\nIn a statement after the vote passed, Biden said: \u201cToday, members of both parties in the House voted to advance our national security interests and send a clear message about the power of American leadership on the world stage. At this critical inflection point, they came together to answer history\u2019s call, passing urgently needed national security legislation that I have fought for months to secure.\n\n\u201cThis package will deliver critical support to Israel and Ukraine; provide desperately needed humanitarian aid to Gaza, Sudan, Haiti and other locations impacted by conflicts and natural disasters around the world; and bolster security and stability in the Indo-Pacific. It comes at a moment of grave urgency, with Israel facing unprecedented attacks from Iran, and Ukraine under continued bombardment from Russia.\u201d He called on the Senate to quickly pass the bill \u201cso that I can sign it into law and we can quickly send weapons and equipment to Ukraine to meet their urgent battlefield needs\u201d.\n\nSimply getting the bills to a vote on the foor required Johnson to seek help from Democrats across the aisle. A procedural vote to get it to the floor was 316-94, with 165 Democrats and 151 Republicans supporting the motion.\n\nJohnson\u2019s reliance on Democratic votes to pass key pieces of legislation, including a major government funding bill that cleared the House last month, has outraged some hard-right Republicans.\n\n\u201cWhat else did Johnson give away while he\u2019s begging Democrats for votes and protection?\u201d Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican representative of Georgia, said on Friday on X. \u201cWe do not have a Republican majority anymore, our Republican Speaker is literally controlled by the Democrats and giving them everything they want.\u201d\n\nLast month, Greene unveiled a motion to remove Johnson as speaker, although she has not yet moved to force a vote on the matter. In the past week, two more House Republicans \u2013 Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Paul Gosar of Arizona \u2013 have signed on as co-sponsors.\n\nDemocrats have said they may support Johnson in any effort by the Republican far-right to oust him over Ukraine aid.\n\nSpeaking from the Capitol earlier this week, Johnson said providing aid to Ukraine was \u201ccritically important\u201d and \u201cthe right thing\u201d despite the potential power of his opponents to bring him down in yet another internal party coup.\n\n\u201cI really believe the intel and the briefings that we\u2019ve gotten,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI believe that Xi and Vladimir Putin and Iran really are an axis of evil. I think they are in coordination on this. I think that Vladimir Putin would continue to march through Europe.\n\n\u201cI am going to allow an opportunity for every single member of the House to vote their conscience and their will,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI\u2019m willing to take a personal risk for that, because we have to do the right thing. And history will judge us.\u201d\n\nThe US has so far sent Ukraine roughly $111bn in weapons, equipment, humanitarian assistance and other aid since the start of the war more than two years ago.\n\nReuters contributed to this report.",

RNC did not respond to a request for data on how many people had volunteered or been staffed in recent elections .",
        "text": "Trump campaign, RNC pledge to deploy 100,000 attorneys and volunteers to monitor the vote\nDonald Trump's presidential campaign and the Republican National Committee announced a massive \u201celection integrity\u201d operation on Friday, promising to deploy 100,000 volunteers and attorneys to battleground states to \u201cprotect the vote and ensure a big win\u201d in November.\n\nIn a press release, officials said they wanted the volunteers and lawyers to monitor logic and accuracy testing, early voting, ballot tabulation, mail ballot processing and Election Day voting, as well as post-election canvasses, audits, and recounts. The release suggests they may intend to recruit poll workers, too.\n\n\u201cHaving the right people to count the ballots is just as important as turning out voters on Election Day,\u201d Trump said in the release..\n\n\"The RNC is hiring hundreds of election integrity staff across the map \u2014 more than ever before because our Party will be recruiting thousands of more observers to protect the vote in 2024. These campaign officials in states are tasked with recruiting, training, and when possible, shifting poll watchers and poll workers day in and day out,\" added RNC co-chair Lara Trump.\n\nPoll watching is a normal part of elections \u2014 both parties do it \u2014 but experts warn that unruly operations can be a problem. And as Trump and his allies continue to make false claims about the 2020 election, some experts worry that empowering these sort of observers at polling sites could hamper normal election operations or intimidate voters.\n\nThe GOP release notes they plan to work with \"passionate grassroots coalitions who are deeply invested in fighting voter fraud.\"\n\nThe planned operation would double the RNC\u2019s promised 50,000-person operation from 2020, though some experts said both numbers figures were aspirational and unrealistic. The RNC did not respond to a request for data on how many people had volunteered or been staffed in recent elections.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve actually run a program like this with real people,\u201d said Justin Levitt, a former advisor in the Biden White House on democracy issues who has previously worked in the Department of Justice on voting issues. \u201cWe did really well and got multiple tens of thousands.\u201d\n\nRecruiting individuals in particular to monitor for voter fraud, he said, is even harder than staffing poll workers.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re recruiting people to stand there and watch for something that\u2019s not going to happen. Can you please show up and watch, wait for the UFO for 15 hours?\u201d he said.\n\nMarc Elias, a leading Democratic election lawyer, agreed the 100,000 number was unrealistic, but said he was still concerned about the plans.\n\n\"I think they are going to have a massive voter suppression operation and it is going to involve very, very large numbers of people and very, very large numbers of lawyers,\" he said. \"I think we need to take the RNC literally and seriously \u2014 except on their numbers.\"\n\nLauren Groh-Wargo, executive director of Fair Fight PAC, the political advocacy arm of the Georgia voting rights group of the same name, said the effort would harm election administration.\n\n\u201cThe Republican National Committee\u2019s new voter suppression unit is just the latest version of their cynical playbook to divide and intimidate voters and steal American\u2019s voices by building an operation based on the lie of voter fraud,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\nUntil 2018, the RNC\u2019s poll watching plans were limited by a consent decree, which required it seek court approval to prove that any poll watching work wasn\u2019t discriminatory.\n\nThat decree was put into place after Democrats sued and accused the RNC of sending armed, off-duty police officers to patrol the polls in minority neighborhoods in 1981. The decree required them to seek prior court approval for poll watching operations, but expired at the end of 2017 after 35 years.\n\nPoll observers are a normal and beneficial part of the election process when they are well trained and do not interfere with administrators work, said David Becker, executive director of the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation and Research, a group that helps support election officials. An army of 100,000 would present a different dynamic, he said, but noted that election workers are prepared to handle unruly observers if they appear.\n\n\"They will protect the right of their voters to vote free of intimidation. If observers are acting any way contrary to voters interests or interfering with poll workers, they will be dealt with under the laws of the state,\" he said.",

        "text": "Togo approves constitutional reform changing how president is elected\nThose opposed to the changes fear they could allow further extensions to President Faure Gnassingbe\u2019s rule.\n\nLawmakers in Togo have approved changes to the constitution linked to presidential term limits and how presidents are elected, which some opposition politicians and civil society groups have denounced as a constitutional coup.\n\nTogo\u2019s parliament had already adopted the amendments on March 25, but the reforms led to an opposition backlash so President Faure Gnassingbe called for further consultations and a second parliamentary vote.\n\nThe lawmakers gave final approval to the reform late on Friday, just days before the April 29 legislative elections that had also been pushed back due to the issues around the constitutional amendments.\n\nThe second reading was passed with all 87 politicians present agreeing to the new system, under which the president will no longer be elected by universal suffrage, but by members of parliament.\n\nThe amendments also introduced a parliamentary system of government and shortened presidential terms to four years from five with a two-term limit.\n\nIt does not take into account the time already spent in office, which could enable Gnassingbe to stay in power until 2033 if he is re-elected in 2025, a highly likely scenario as his party controls parliament.\n\nThose opposed to the changes fear they could allow further extensions of the president\u2019s 19-year rule and his family\u2019s grip on power. His father and predecessor Gnassingbe Eyadema seized power in the coastal West African country via a coup in 1967.\n\nIn a statement on Saturday, the Dynamique Pour la Majorit\u00e9 du Peuple (DMP) opposition coalition and other signatories said the constitutional changes were a political manoeuvre to allow Gnassingbe to extend his tenure for life.\n\n\u201cWhat happened at the National Assembly yesterday is a coup d\u2019etat,\u201d they said.\n\n\u201cLarge-scale action will be organised over the next few days to say \u2018no\u2019 to this constitution.\u201d\n\n\u2018To preserve power by any means\u2019\n\n\u201cTogo has just turned a new page on its way towards a more inclusive and participatory democracy. This is a satisfaction and a source of pride for us,\u201d Koumealo Anate, a lawmaker from Gnassingbe\u2019s ruling UNIR party, told reporters after Friday\u2019s vote.\n\nHowever, a group of 17 civil society organisations said the amendments amount to a \u201cproject to \u2026 confiscate power by a regime that is systematically opposed to any form of democratic change\u201d, in a joint statement they issued this week. They also called on West Africa\u2019s main political and economic bloc ECOWAS to take action in response.\n\n\u201cTime has shown us that the major concern of his regime is to preserve power by any means,\u201d Nathaniel Olympio, president of the opposition party Parti des Togolais, told the AFP news agency before the vote.\n\n\u201cThe function of president of the council gives someone the latitude to exercise power in an unlimited manner, so logically we believe that this is the position that he will hold for himself.\u201d\n\nSeveral other African countries, including the Central African Republic, Rwanda, Republic of the Congo, Ivory Coast and Guinea, have pushed through constitutional and other legal changes in recent years allowing presidents to extend their terms in office.\n\nThe West and Central African region has also witnessed eight military coups in the past three years.\n\nViolent police crackdowns on political demonstrations have been routine under Gnassingbe, as they were during his father\u2019s long rule.\n\nFaure Gnassingbe was last re-elected in a 2020 landslide disputed by the opposition.\n\nThe new constitution also creates a new role, president of the council of ministers, with extensive authority to manage government affairs.",

        "text": "Ukraine, Gaza: Joe Biden's foreign policy is mired in contradictions\nNews analysisThe ambiguity of American diplomacy in the face of two major conflicts has weakened Joe Biden's administration, with just a few months left before the presidential election. By seeking to avoid escalation without ever imposing the conditions for a resolution, the United States has lost credibility.\n\nElected president of the United States in 2020, Joe Biden promised to put an end to \"forever wars.\" Four years later, as his term of office draws to a close, a strange paradox is emerging. The leader kept his word by withdrawing American troops from Afghanistan as early as the summer of 2021, even though the debacle of that withdrawal still haunts his administration. Since then, he has had to get involved in two conflicts with global shockwaves, in Ukraine and in Gaza. The US has thrown all its military and diplomatic weight behind these conflicts, putting its reputation on the line. But its credibility has now been damaged, given the means employed, the results obtained and, above all, the untenable contradictions in the way the government approached these two crises. With seven months to go before the presidential election, the Biden administration seems bogged down, just when foreign policy was supposed to be its trump card.\n\nAn objective look at the US's strategic interests reveals that the results are far from negative. No American soldier has died in Ukraine, while the Russian army suffered a historic setback in the initial phase of the war: Its ranks were decimated and its capabilities diminished on land, air and sea. In addition to this unexpected result, any direct confrontation between NATO and Russia, in a conflict that would spill over Ukraine's borders, has been avoided. The objective set by the White House has been achieved \u2212 there has been no escalation. For the sake of this priority, Washington refused to offer Kyiv a timetable for NATO membership at the Vilnius summit in July 2023. As for relations with allies, damaged under Donald Trump's presidency, they have been restored and intensified, even if apprehension is mounting in Europe at the prospect of the former president's possible return to power.\n\nIn the Middle East, on the other front, the US is contemplating a precipice. After Hamas's unprecedented attack in Israel on October 7, 2023, with acts of violence that shocked US officials, the Biden administration reacted without delay. \"This is not just about policy or strategy. This is personal for us,\" said National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan 10 days later. Right from the start of Israel's ground offensive in Gaza, Washington had set itself one goal: to avoid a regional conflict involving Iran and the Lebanon-based Hezbollah. This objective was met, thanks to the massive deployment of naval forces in the eastern Mediterranean.\n\nYou have 86.36% of this article left to read. The rest is for subscribers only.",

        "text": "How TikTok Changed America\nAn Incomplete Guide Love, Hate or Fear It, \u200b\u200bTikTok Has Changed America As lawmakers argue for TikTok to be sold, some of the app\u2019s most popular memes, from skateboarding with a Fleetwood Mac soundtrack to the renegade dance, have been seen tens of millions of times.\n\nHear Times writers tell the stories of how TikTok has influenced culture\n\nHas there ever been an app more American seeming than TikTok, with its messy democratic creativity, exhibitionism, utter lack of limits and vast variety of hustlers? And yet, of course, TikTok is not American, which is the whole reason that in March, the House of Representatives passed a bill with broad bipartisan support that would force the Chinese owners of the video-app juggernaut to either sell to a non-Chinese owner or face a ban. Lawmakers say it\u2019s a national security threat, and that the Chinese government could lean on its owner, ByteDance, to obtain sensitive U.S. user data or influence content on the app to serve its interests. There\u2019s a long road of legislation, deal making and legal challenges ahead before TikTok could be forced to change ownership or even be banned. The Senate would need to pass the legislation \u2014 which it may do as soon, now that the House has bundled it into a foreign aid package. It would have to survive lawsuits from TikTok and creators. Buyers would have to clear regulatory approval. And after all that, Beijing could simply block a deal. But imagining what a United States without TikTok would look like throws into sharp relief just how much the app has worked its way into American culture. Roughly 170 million Americans use TikTok. That\u2019s half the population of the United States. TikTok, which officially landed in the United States in 2018, was the most downloaded app in the country, and the world, in 2020, 2021 and 2022. It wasn\u2019t that the elements of it were so new \u2014 compelling videos from randos had long been a staple of American pop culture \u2014 but TikTok put the pieces together in a new way. Unlike Instagram, Facebook or Snapchat, TikTok didn\u2019t build itself around social connections. Its goal is pure, uncut entertainment. The algorithm ingested every data point it could from what users skipped, liked or shared \u2014 and spat it directly into the maddeningly habit-forming For You Page. Fans whispered reverently that it knew them better than they knew themselves. Here are 19 ways of understanding how TikTok became part of American life. The music America listens to, the movies it sees, what conspiracies it believes, how it can make or break a product\u2019s success, who it defines as a celebrity \u2014 all of it has been influenced by TikTok, for good and bad. Even if you\u2019ve never opened the app, you\u2019ve lived in a culture that exists downstream of what happens there.\n\nIt Became Hollywood\u2019s Favorite Marketing Machine #barbenheimer #anyonebutyou Insular, slow-changing Hollywood responded to TikTok\u2019s arrival in 2018 in typical fashion: complete dismissal. We\u2019re way too busy making pictures to worry about some new short-form video app. Then came denial. (This thing is just another fad.) Next, fear. (Teenagers and young adults are never going to the movies again!) But there\u2019s a plot twist: Hollywood has come to see TikTok as indispensable. \u201cAnyone But You,\u201d a Sony romantic comedy starring Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell, arrived to a piddly $8 million in ticket sales over Christmas weekend. The movie turned into a full-fledged hit ($219 million) after TikTok users (at the urging of Sony) began making videos of themselves re-enacting the credit sequence. TikTok also served as a ticket-selling machine for \u201cM3gan,\u201d a Universal-Blumhouse horror movie about a sassy robot that has spawned a new franchise; \u201cWonka,\u201d which debuted in December and collected $632 million; and the Barbenheimer box office phenomenon, otherwise known as \u201cBarbie,\u201d with $1.4 billion, and \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d with about $1 billion. Rote glamour shots and insipid interviews \u2014 ye olde studio publicity tools \u2014 don\u2019t work on TikTok; users want behind-the-scenes \u201crealness.\u201d Hence \u201cOppenheimer\u201d stars goofing in a hotel hallway before a premiere, and pink-clad \u201cBarbie\u201d stars cavorting on the floor with puppies. \u201cNow that studios have figured out how to harness TikTok, the last thing they want is for it to go dark,\u201d said Sue Fleishman, a former Universal and Warner Bros. executive who is now a consultant. \u201cThat would actually be a big problem.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s Gen Z\u2019s Walter Cronkite #disaster #medialiteracy #moonlanding Recently, V Spehar has posted TikTok videos telling viewers what they might have missed from President Biden\u2019s State of the Union address, the first 15 actions that former President Donald J. Trump said he would take if he\u2019s re-elected in November and Caitlin Clark\u2019s WNBA starting salary. Mx. Spehar posts to more than three million followers from the handle @UnderTheDeskNews and films many clips lying on the floor, a gimmick that began as an effort to differentiate from the authoritative tone of traditional television news anchors. The style of communication has resonated enough to make Mx. Spehar a regular at White House briefings with social media influencers. News aggregation and analysis accounts like Mx. Spehar\u2019s are shaping the discourse about current events in the United States, especially among young people. They\u2019re a modern version of old-school bloggers \u2014 users respond to the personal tone, and the editorializing. (Some creators have even built followings simply by reading print news articles to their followers.) Pew Research Center has found that about one-third of 18- to 29-year-olds say they get news regularly on the platform, far outpacing people in other age groups. In 2023, about 14% of American adults said they regularly got news on TikTok, compared with just 3% percent in 2020. Other sites have similar draws. Roughly 16 percent of all American adults get their news from Instagram, and a similar amount from X. Far more people consume news on Facebook and YouTube. The appeal of TikTok and other social sites has made mainstream outlets nervous, and has raised some concerns around accuracy and context as original reporting is funneled through other accounts. The Wall Street Journal has more than 340,000 followers on TikTok, while The New York Times has nearly 630,000 \u2014 numbers that pale in comparison with the followings of individual commentators like Mx. Spehar.\n\nIt Supercharges Conspiracy Theories #conspiracy Several dentists recently took to TikTok to debunk a conspiracy theory: that toothpaste tubes were printed with secret codes signaling their true ingredients to powerful people in the know. Their efforts garnered far fewer views than the video that offered up the theory in early January. Not counting all the times the post was referenced in videos by other TikTok users, it has been seen more than seven million times in less than three months. Tall tales are common on TikTok, where a flimsy patchwork of assumptions and coincidences \u2014 often concerning the schemes of a nefarious echelon of elites \u2014 is illustrated by dramatic images generated by artificial intelligence and spooky musical tracks. (Other such hits include false theories that President Joe Biden rigged the Super Bowl in favor of the Kansas City Chiefs or that Justin Bieber had signaled he was a victim of PizzaGate. False allegations of voter fraud also abound.) Abbie Richards, a misinformation researcher who studies the TikTok ecosystem, said that such posts thrive because of the platform\u2019s potent recommendation algorithms and its low barrier to entry. TikTok allows users to earn money from their videos through tools such as its creator rewards program and livestream subscriptions. Conspiracy theories, which draw high engagement, are one of the most profitable categories, said Ms. Richards, a senior video producer at the liberal watchdog group Media Matters. \u201cIt\u2019s like candy for your brain \u2014 it tells a story that simplifies the world in a way that feels good to you,\u201d she said. A quarter of American adults who use the app create 98% of its videos. The toothpaste theory was promoted by two young men known for conspiratorial content, including popular posts about satanic hit men and Britney Spears. They claimed that the colored dots on toothpaste tubes correspond to all-natural, medicinal or chemical ingredients. The post was quickly reposted, copied and stitched into reaction videos. Some came from dentists, who explained that the dots were actually used during the toothpaste packaging process to help guide manufacturing equipment to properly cut and seal the tubes. That conspiracy theory is not new \u2014 they rarely are on TikTok. Colgate, a major toothpaste manufacturer, addressed the color patch rumor last year and said that \u201cas much as we love cracking secret codes, this one actually has nothing to crack because it\u2019s entirely untrue.\u201d Even silly rumors, however, can spin out from TikTok into real-world harms. The baseless concerns that store-bought toothpaste tubes might hide toxic ingredients reignited recommendations to opt instead for unproven and potentially damaging homemade options.\n\nIt Got Taylor Swift to Defy Her Label #newmusic #albumrelease For the music industry, TikTok has become a potent but unpredictable promotional outlet, and a vital one in the race to mint a new hit. Young artists like Olivia Rodrigo and Lil Nas X saw their popularity explode on the platform, and acts like Fleetwood Mac have seen decades-old songs get a boost from memes on the app. But TikTok is also the latest tech platform to draw the anger of the music industry for low royalty rates. In February, Universal Music Group, which represents artists like Ms. Rodrigo, Taylor Swift, Billie Eilish and Drake, withdrew the rights to its music on the app, saying that TikTok was trying to \u201cbully\u201d the company to accept low terms. Within days, millions of TikTok videos using music from Universal artists went mute, and since then guessing which side would blink first has become a media-business parlor game. Last week, however, Ms. Swift \u2014 who releases her music through Universal, but has owned the copyrights to her work since 2018 \u2014 broke ranks and put her songs back on TikTok, just ahead of the release of her next album on Friday. Now the question is, will other artists will follow.\n\nIt Might Just Be a Weapon For years I thought TikTok was mostly a parenting problem, and had only tangential bearing on what I cover: threats to national security. It took a while \u2014 and a lot of conversations with both tech firms and government officials \u2014 for me to become concerned about the potential that it could also pose a major problem on that front. Not because the company\u2019s Chinese owners could figure out your dance-move preferences, but because the algorithm at the core of the app is wrapped in such mystery. So what\u2019s the issue? The algorithm doesn\u2019t belong to TikTok; it is provided by engineers working for ByteDance, the Chinese company that controls the platform and develops the code in enormous secrecy in laboratories around the world, in Beijing, Singapore and Mountain View, Calif. No one outside the company knows exactly what goes into those algorithms. The Chinese government is intent on keeping it that way. It has issued regulations that require Beijing\u2019s regulators to grant permission before any ByteDance algorithms can be licensed to outsiders. They are unlikely to do so. And so, as long as it is written by ByteDance, and can\u2019t be picked apart on the outside, there will always be the risk that it will become a pipeline for influencing citizens, and thus voters, in subtle and not-so-subtle ways. Senator Mark Warner, the chairman of Senate Intelligence Committee, has noted that because TikTok has emerged as a major source of news \u2014 and because it collects data on users that the Chinese government could find useful, even crucial \u2014 it poses a serious threat, and could become \u201cthe most powerful propaganda tool ever.\u201d Of course, that threat is mostly hypothetical at this point. At least based on what the United States has made public. The intelligence agencies have been giving closed-door briefings, but presumably there hasn\u2019t been a classified blockbuster, since there would likely be great pressure to declassify it. Still, we have seen waves of new influence campaigns flowing out of China \u2014 much of it aimed at nations other than the United States. While TikTok has not been at the center of those campaigns, clearly, the Chinese have learned a lot in the past few years, including from the Russians. (Researchers have also found that topics commonly suppressed in China, including about the Tibetan and Uyghur populations, appear to be unusually underrepresented on TikTok compared with Instagram.) This is not a problem that would be solved by simply selling TikTok\u2019s operations to an American buyer. Sure, the bill that went through the House bans a new, Western-owned TikTok from having any \u201coperational relationship\u201d with ByteDance, \u201cincluding any cooperation with respect to the operation of a content recommendation algorithm.\u201d Good luck with that \u2014 TikTok would no longer be TikTok. The real question is whether anyone gets to look under the hood. Because to make Americans trust TikTok, the country will need an early warning system, something that will assure everyone that a technology that became popular because it generated memes and celebrates self-expression does not become a conduit for a foreign government interested in subtly influencing how we vote.\n\nIt Turned the School Bathroom Into a Movie Set #toilettoks #school #schoolbathroom Southern Alamance Middle School, a public school in Graham, N.C., recently came up with a novel way to combat student distractions from social media. Or at least to curb the phenomenon that some teachers have dubbed \u201cToilet TikToks.\u201d The problem: Educators there noticed a spike in the number of students asking to leave class \u2014 sometimes as frequently as nine times per day \u2014 to go to the bathroom, where they made TikTok videos. The solution: Administrators decided to remove the bathroom mirrors that students used to film TikToks and primp for their close-ups. They also introduced an online system that issues students digital hall passes when they want to be excused from class and that allows administrators to track students\u2019 locations. \u201cSince removing the mirrors,\u201d administrators wrote in a message to parents in January, \u201cwe have seen a drastic decrease in bathroom visits from students asking to be excused just to make videos.\u201d Toilettoks \u2014 a TikTok genre, dating back at least five years, in which students use school bathrooms as film sets for dance routines, lip-syncing clips or critiques of unclean lavatories \u2014 are one of the milder social media annoyances for schools. Across the United States, students have also used school bathrooms as arenas to stage, film and post videos of bullying, physical assaults on schoolmates and acts of vandalism. In March, Alamance-Burlington schools announced that it was joining dozens of other U.S. districts that have filed lawsuits accusing social media platforms, including TikTok, of unfairly ensnaring young people. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the negative impacts of social media on our students every day,\u201d Kristy Davis, the acting superintendent of Alamance-Burlington schools, said. \u201cTheir well-being has to be the top priority.\u201d\n\nIt Took Over All the Other Apps My favorite Instagram account is a collection of TikToks. Curated by the videographer Leia Josp\u00e9, @favetiktoks420 hunts for Gen-Z\u2019s ickiest thirst traps and bleakest acting exercises and delivers them to me in a Millennial-safe package, uploading them directly to a social network that I actually use. By the time TikTok debuted, in 2017, I was already in my 30s and too old and lazy to work another app into my rotation. Instagram and Twitter were distracting enough. But now those platforms lie downstream of TikTok\u2019s creative wellspring, waiting for bits of its most popular content to drift into the open internet. TikToks float into my friends\u2019 Instagram stories, percolate into our group chats, swirl into my Twitter feed. My phone is always bleating with its outro sound effect. I rarely open TikTok, but I watch TikToks all the time. TikToks let loose a chaotic element into Instagram\u2019s internet mall, and they break the monotony of Twitter\u2019s boosted tech-bro threads. They stock YouTube compilations and spark Facebook debates and fuel trend pieces. If TikTok were to disappear, it would feel, at least for a while, like the internet\u2019s big content spigot had been turned to a trickle. Rival platforms have tried to remake themselves in TikTok\u2019s image \u2014 building in short-form videos, algorithmic timelines and searchable sound clips \u2014 but have failed to reproduce the hypnotic energy of its perpetual discovery machine. We\u2019d be left with a diluted version of its secret sauce. But any network that hopes to capitalize on its own popularity will disrupt its product. Even as other social media platforms try to become TikTok, TikTok is trying to become them, lengthening its videos to compete with YouTube and introducing an e-commerce platform to \u201cdrive meaningful shopping experiences\u201d and rival Instagram. Eventually some new, inexplicably addictive platform will rise in its place. And I will rely on the kindness of some slightly younger strangers to show me what\u2019s on it.\n\nIt Mimics a Flow State #relaxing #satisfying #oddlysatisfying Much has been said about the \u201caddictive design\u201d of TikTok. But what is the social media site actually doing to our brains? There is very little research looking at what goes on inside people\u2019s heads while they\u2019re using TikTok. But one small study conducted on Chinese university students used magnetic resonance imaging to compare brain activity while they watched personalized TikTok videos (ones the algorithm had selected based on their past use) versus generalized ones (videos the app recommended to new users). The students had greater activity in several areas of the brain, including ones associated with reward, attention and processing social information, while viewing personalized videos. In other words, the algorithm did its job. Other social media platforms have been shown to turn on similar brain regions. So what makes TikTok different? Some experts have proposed that it can send users into a \u201cflow state\u201d: the experience of being so absorbed in a task that the person loses track of time. Backing this up, one study found that TikTok users reported experiencing higher levels of flow than Instagram users. \u201cFlow\u201d is often associated with work or hobbies \u2014 activities that are challenging enough to be engaging but not frustrating. Watching videos doesn\u2019t require skill the way that many flow-inducing activities do, yet the app is able to induce the feelings of enjoyment, concentration and time distortion that are characteristic of flow \u2014 possibly because of the algorithm\u2019s immersive quality.\n\nIt Won Over the Snobbiest Gatekeeper #metgala #tiktokfashion #redcarpet Is there any more official signal that a business titan has arrived at the heart of the American social-financial-artistic-political power nexus than being invited to be an honorary host of the annual Met Gala, a.k.a. \u201cthe party of the year\u201d? Any more glamorous recognition than being asked to join its convener, the Vogue editor, Anna Wintour, in the Metropolitan Museum\u2019s soaring atrium as the great and the good of Hollywood, fashion, sports, Wall Street and Washington swan past? On May 6, TikTok will be lead sponsor of both the party and the museum fashion exhibition it celebrates. The company\u2019s chief executive, Shou Chew, has been named an honorary chair of this year\u2019s gala, along with the Loewe designer Jonathan Anderson, while Ms. Wintour, Zendaya, Bad Bunny, Jennifer Lopez and Chris Hemsworth are the event\u2019s co-chairs. That placement would put TikTok firmly in the tradition of previous gala sponsors like Amazon, Instagram and Apple \u2014 tech companies bedazzled by the Old Establishment, which in turn is bedazzled by their blush of upstart cool. It is an acknowledgment, if any were needed, of the prominent role the app has come to play in fashion in a mere few years. It was only in 2021, after all, that Ms. Wintour was criticized for inviting TikTok stars such as Addison Rae and Dixie D\u2019Amelio to the party \u2014 for somehow cheapening it by catering to the buzzfeed machine of the smartphone, rather than the elite. After all, not just anyone can get an invite, even if they can afford the $50,000 price tag for a seat; Ms. Wintour vets every guest, and the price of admission has to do with cultural currency even more than actual currency. Which is why, of course, TikTok belongs. Despite the fact that all social media is forbidden inside the party. Fast-forward three years, and there are more than 75 billion views associated with the #TikTokfashion hashtag; almost 500 million with #2023Gala alone. Luxury brands routinely sign up TikTok stars as brand ambassadors along with every other kind of star, hoping to access their audience (received relevance is something Vogue might be getting out of the association, too). And thus is created a virtuous \u2014 or vicious? \u2014 cycle in which TikTok feeds the gala machine, which feeds TikTok, which is the vicarious experience that has come to feed us all.\n\nIt Led People to Self-Diagnose ADHD #mentalhealth #adhdcommunity #psychiatry TikTok is a mother lode of mental health content, filled with compelling first-person accounts of everything from major depression to selective mutism. Depending on your perspective, that\u2019s either a very good thing \u2014 or concerning. Corey Basch, who analyzed 100 popular TikTok videos with the hashtag #mentalhealth for a 2022 study, emerged concerned about the looping effect of the algorithm. \u201cWhat\u2019s so important and disturbing to recognize is the downward spiral that users can get swept into,\u201d said Dr. Basch, a professor of public health at William Paterson University. \u201cIf one is drawn to posts related to despair and anxiety, they can easily spend hours exposed to repetitive content known as an echo chamber.\u201d The surge of content about mental health has meant that young people are more likely to self-diagnose before seeing a clinician, psychiatrists report. Diagnoses for ADHD and anxiety disorders shot up during the pandemic years, especially among young people. Some researchers have expressed concern about how profit motives may feed into these trends, since platforms often feature advertising from app-based mental health services, and influencers have sponsorship deals with such companies. \u201cThey say we can diagnose you really quick, just take this five-question quiz and we can send you a prescription in a nice little box,\u201d said Holly Avella, a Ph.D. candidate at Rutgers University who has researched mental health and social media. Researchers also warn that TikTok videos can deliver misinformation. A review of literature published last year found that around one-fifth of videos mentioning cognitive behavioral therapy were inaccurate, describing it as ineffective or harmful. But some users credit the app with breaking open the national conversation around mental illness. \u201cYou can sit there on your pedestal and pooh-pooh it all you want,\u201d said Kate Speer, who has used her social media feeds to describe her experience of serious mental illness. TikTok is helpful for \u201cthe very people who are struggling the most, those who don\u2019t have access to services in the real world and who might even be so disabled by mental illness that they are locked in their houses.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the Latest Campaign Tool #campaign President Biden turned down an opportunity to appear on CBS and reach tens of millions of potential voters tuning in for this year\u2019s Super Bowl. Instead, he released his first TikTok. \u201cChiefs or Niners?\u201d asked a disembodied, youthful-sounding voice. \u201cTwo great quarterbacks; hard to decide,\u201d replied the president, casually dressed in a half-zip sweater and khakis. The caption was \u201clol hey guys.\u201d Team Biden, like most other major politicians, had previously resisted joining the app because of security concerns related to its Chinese ownership. (The Donald Trump campaign is not on TikTok, and Mr. Trump has expressed divergent views about the app, proposing a ban during his presidency but recently criticizing an attempt by Congress to curtail its use in the United States.) Giving in was a nod to the irrefutable importance of TikTok, where about 14 percent of American adults regularly get news, in an election year. There\u2019s now a small studio in the Biden campaign office in Wilmington, Del., where staff members can film \u201ccandid\u201d videos with the candidate. 62% of Americans between 18- and 29-years-old use the platform, greater than the share of that age group that voted in the last presidential election. Campaigns have a rich tradition of adapting to the latest technological fads, from wireless radio to television sets and, more recently, to social platforms like Facebook and Snapchat. Many of these efforts share a how-do-you-do-fellow-kids quality to them, and in an attempt to avoid appearing out of touch, the Biden campaign relies on young, digitally fluent aides to host its TikToks. It works, sometimes. One video claims to have Trump \u201ccaught on camera\u201d making offensive remarks, an attempt to replicate the amateur spontaneity of many TikToks. (In reality, it\u2019s someone\u2019s iPhone aimed at a TV broadcast of a Trump speech.) Other times it comes across try-hard-y, like the video that dismisses a post by Representative Jim Jordan using a popular \u201cI Ain\u2019t Reading All That\u201d online meme. The @bidenhq account, though, is hovering around 299,000 followers \u2014 still small beans in the TikTok world. But in a close race, every lol counts.\n\nIt\u2019s the New Mall #denimskirt #springfashion #goingouttops Most months, when Kiara Springs posts on her TikTok account about mini skirts or linen tops she finds on Amazon, she earns $10,000 to $12,000 for getting people to buy what she suggests. During her biggest month, Ms. Springs, 25, raked in $50,000 for her posts. TikTok is now a multibillion-dollar shopping experience \u2014 and companies have glommed on. The internet might have killed malls, but now it is one big mall. Because the bite-size videos are addictive, and partly because advertising on the platform is relatively inexpensive for smaller brands, the app has become a core part of many companies\u2019 marketing plans. Brands say that their videos populated with everyday people can more easily go viral than on, say, Instagram, where they often need to pay expensive influencers. And people who notice shopping-related content spend more time on TikTok, according to eMarketer. The average user spends nearly an hour \u2014 58 minutes \u2014 per day on the platform. Last year, TikTok debuted a prominent shopping feed on the app that now allows people to buy goods directly from a wide array of vendors. Some fashion and beauty brands think about the TikTok content they could make for a product before developing it. Fiona Co Chan, a co-founder of Youthforia, a beauty and skin care brand with roughly 190,000 followers on the app, says if she can\u2019t think of 200 TikTok videos that she could make for a product, she\u2019ll likely scrap it entirely.\n\nIt Made You Buy That One Water Bottle When a product goes viral on TikTok, those views often translate directly into increased sales. In some cases, the effect has been dramatic: Stanley tumblers Company revenue last year was $750 million, up from $73 million in 2019, after the product became a sensation on TikTok.\n\nFeta cheese Demand jumped 200 percent at one grocery chain in 2021, after a recipe for baked feta pasta took off and amassed more than 20 million views.\n\nCerave Sales increased by more than 60 percent in 2020 after skin care became a lockdown pastime and TikTok users discovered the drugstore mainstay.\n\nCat Crack Catnip It briefly sold out in 2021 after TikTok users posted videos of their cats going crazy for it.\n\nIsle of Paradise tanning spray It sold out in 48 hours in 2021 after a post about it went viral.\n\nPrepdeck kitchen storage products They went out of stock in 2021 after going viral.\n\nIt Knows Where You Live Every social media app is, essentially, a spy in your pocket. When it comes to data collection, TikTok is no worse than the others. The main difference, and the one that\u2019s driving the current conversation in Washington, is that TikTok is owned by a Chinese company. TikTok, like other apps, seeks a huge amount of information from you, and some pieces of it that can seem innocuous are quite revealing, including: Your I.P. address and location An I.P. address is a unique identifier associated with your device or the network you use to get on the internet. TikTok can use your I.P. address and location to determine the advertising you see, but it can also reveal other real-life associations. When people access a social network from the same I.P. address, it reveals that they may know one another offline. ByteDance, which owns TikTok, used I.P. address data collected from journalists using the app to try to identify company employees who were speaking to them. Your contacts Giving TikTok access to the hundreds (or thousands) of numbers and email addresses on your phone \u2014 an opt-in feature \u2014 lets them draw unexpected insights into your life, such as who your doctors are, your present and former colleagues, your one-night stands, and on and on. TikTok may then recommend you follow them as \u201cpeople you may know\u201d \u2014 and your account, in turn, will be suggested to them, so beware of sharing contacts if you\u2019re trying to stay anonymous. Even if you don\u2019t share your contacts, TikTok can look for the phone or email address you gave the company in other users\u2019 address books unless you go into the privacy settings and turn off \u201cSuggest Your Account to Others.\u201d Your messages Unless your messages are end-to-end encrypted, which they are not on TikTok, they can be reviewed by the company storing them for you. Your viewing history Are you obsessed with steamy Twilight highlight reels or home repair videos? TikTok knows.\n\nIt Teaches 22-Year-Olds How to Live Their Best Middle-Age Life #early20s #midlifemuse #grwm Shelley Polanco is 22, and a senior at Brandeis. As she faces life after college, she is not looking for practical advice about, say, jobs and careers. She yearns instead for a guidebook to what it feels like to be an adult, something to tell her about her future emotional life and satisfaction. And so, she likes following TikTok accounts that feature \u201can older woman of culture, kind of like this auntie figure who gets on TikTok and records \u2018things I wish I would have known in my 20s.\u2019\u201d She\u2019s a fan of @itsrealllylola. \u201cShe\u2019s turning 25, and she starts to speak about all the things she\u2019s learned, the ways you maybe want to ignore people\u2019s judgments on you,\u201d Ms. Polanco says. \u201cShe\u2019s big on \u2018live your life and have fun.\u2019\u201d She peers decades into her future with the help of Dr. Amanda Hanson, \u201c#midlifemuse,\u201d who invites comments about life after 50 from her TikTok followers. Or Shera Seven. \u201cShe is this 40-year-old woman, I want to say, giving really brutal dating advice,\u201d Ms. Polanco said. Ms. Polanco was having trouble seeing more than three months out, and found support from a TikTok transformation coach named Shannon. \u201cI searched, \u2018how to write goals,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThere was this lady walking you through this meditation to visualize your future self, and it was one of the only times I could see an older version of myself. It was so inspirational, I closed the app, got out a piece of paper and started writing.\u201d\n\nIt Tilted Your Screen TikTok didn\u2019t invent vertically oriented videos. But it has been very influential in getting people to watch their screens upright instead of sideways. It\u2019s a phenomenon that is sticking elsewhere, with Apple, a professional Spanish soccer league and major news publishers all producing vertical videos. Even The New York Times is on board.",

        "text": "State law takes US a step closer to popular vote deciding presidential elections\nAfter much public debate, a Maine law has brought the country closer to having the popular vote determine the winner of national presidential elections -- but it's unlikely that will happen before November or even at all.\n\nEarlier this week, Maine Gov. Janet Mills allowed a bill to become law without her signature that would take effect once the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact is able to gather pledges for at least 270 electoral votes -- the number of delegate votes needed to elect a president.\n\nThe movement has now gathered pledges from 17 states and Washington, D.C. -- accounting for a total of 209 electoral votes.\n\nThe movement seeks to change the way a president is chosen, without a constitutional amendment, but experts say it's unclear what happens when enough states have signed on. It's unlikely this would happen before the 2024 election.\n\nThe National Popular Vote Interstate Compact seeks to guarantee that the candidate who receives the most popular votes in all 50 states and the District of Columbia wins the presidency.\n\nWhen there are enough states pledging their popular votes to meet the 270 Electoral College vote threshold, all the votes in those states will be added up to a national count that determines the winner of the election. The National Popular Vote Interstate Compact says that will give each vote equal weight regardless of where a voter lives.\n\nMaine's Democratic Gov. Janet Mills delivers her State of the State address, Jan. 30, 2024, at the State House in Augusta, Maine. Robert F. Bukaty/AP\n\nFive of the 46 presidents who came into office lost the popular vote, including Donald Trump most recently in 2016. The compact argues that not every vote is equal under the current system.\n\n\"Under the current system, a small number of votes in a small number of states regularly decides the Presidency. All-or-nothing payoffs fuel doubt, controversy over real or imagined irregularities, hair-splitting post-election litigation, and unrest,\" the compact says on its website.\n\n\"In 2020, if 21,461 voters had changed their minds, Joe Biden would have been defeated, despite leading by over 7 million votes nationally. Each of these 21,461 voters (5,229 in Arizona, 5,890 in Georgia, and 10,342 in Wisconsin) was 329 times more important than the 7 million voters elsewhere,\" the compact says.\n\nOne expert says that everything that has to do with the Electoral College is controversial these days with a partisan divide on the issue. Many Democrats want to get rid of it, while more Republicans support it.\n\n\"If you look at all the presidential elections from 1992 through 2020, Republicans have won the presidential popular vote only once -- and that was in 2004 when [George W.] Bush beat John Kerry in the popular vote. In every other election over the last 30 years, Democrats have won the popular vote, but because of the Electoral College, Republicans have gotten the presidency a couple of times despite losing the popular vote,\" Darrell West, a Douglas Dillon chair in governmental studies at the Brookings Institute, told ABC News in an interview.\n\n\"Republicans feel the Electoral College advantages them now and so they don't want to get rid of it,\" West said.\n\nWest said the country currently only has a handful of swing states because of the Electoral College, so candidates spend most of their money on that small number of states.\n\n\"If we got rid of the Electoral College, candidates actually would campaign more broadly. They would visit more states because a vote in Illinois is the same as a vote in California,\" West said.\n\nCould this work?\n\nExperts say the most direct way to change how presidents are elected is to amend the U.S. Constitution, but there doesn't currently seem to be a feasible pathway without a consensus between both parties.\n\n\"Ultimately, there probably is going to have to be a constitutional amendment to get rid of the Electoral College, but everyone knows that's not possible now for political reasons. It takes a very large majority in Congress as well as in the states to make any change to the Constitution. So what states are trying to figure out is, 'Short of a constitutional amendment, are there ways to improve the Electoral College?'\" West said.\n\nA voter casts her ballot at a polling station in New York, April 2, 2024. Li Rui/Xinhua via Getty Images\n\nBut it remains unclear what happens when enough states pledge their delegates.\n\n\"There's a lot of deep legal contestation over what happens next. I mean, in my judgment, I think it needs congressional consent,\" Derek Muller, a law professor at Notre Dame Law School, told ABC News.\n\n\"If Congress fails to do that, I'm sure there will be litigation,\" Muller said.\n\nThere are other legal questions, such as whether it would violate equal protections if the U.S. were to have different states with different rules for their elections and questions about whether a state has the authority to do this, Muller said.\n\n\"There are lots of open, contested questions ... where I think the national popular vote, if it does hit 270, will immediately face a series of legal challenges,\" Muller said.\n\nWest agreed that the legal situation is unclear.\n\n\"It's not obvious what the status would be of these laws. States do have the authority to set election laws. But according to the Constitution, the electors to the Electoral College actually are free to vote the way they want,\" West said.\n\n\"And so states can pass laws, but there haven't been a lot of cases testing these provisions. And so it's not clear how the Supreme Court would rule on this issue,\" West added.\n\nMuller said if a state sues another state, that case would go directly before the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n\"It's really unclear who would bring the challenge or where they would bring it. One of the more interesting wrinkles is that there is the possibility, when you're dealing with a compact, you file directly in the United States Supreme Court so that could be a place where it goes. But again, I think there's a lot of possibilities about the litigation strategy if it does hit 270 [pledges],\" Muller said.\n\nHas something like this happened before?\n\nAbout 100 years ago, before the 17th Amendment was passed -- which allows for the direct election of senators -- states had begun shifting from legislatures choosing members sent by the state to the U.S. Senate to having \"preference polls\" for the public where they would signal who they wanted to represent the state.\n\n\"Some states -- I think Oregon was one of the leaders among some others -- would institute preference polls for the people for their senators. So they would hold an election that wasn't binding, but it would just request, 'Who do you want us to vote for?' And then you got a sentiment from the people and the legislature could or could not follow that,\" Muller said.\n\nLater, those states -- including Oregon -- began binding themselves to the results of the preference polls, Muller said. He pointed to this as an analogy in which the states were trying to \"convert legislative elections into a popular vote, even though there was no formal mechanism to do so.\"\n\nAn exterior view of The White House on January 19, 2021 in Washington, DC. Eric Thayer/Getty Images\n\nEventually, the Constitution was amended to make Senate seats elected by popular vote.\n\nWest argues that the direct election of senators did require the constitutional amendment to go into effect.\n\n\"And that was 100 years ago, when the political times were less polarized than what we have today,\" West said.\n\nSome states unsuccessfully tried to implement term limits for members of Congress about 20 or 30 years ago, Muller said. The Supreme Court said that was unconstitutional in 1995.\n\n\"So Missouri tried something a little more creative, which was to say, 'OK, we're going to ask all candidates to take a term-limits pledge, and we're gonna print if they violated their pledge, we're gonna put that on the ballot, or if they declined to support the term-limits pledge ... we're gonna print that on the ballot,'\" Muller said.\n\n\"The goal was to say, 'Well, we're not keeping you off the ballot, we're just telling everyone whether or not you're adhering to term limits,'\" Muller said. \"And the Supreme Court said, 'Well you can't do that either.'\"",

        "text": "Who will be Trump\u2019s vice-president? A shortlist\nThe guessing game is nearly over. Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, has said he has made a decision about who his running mate will be in November \u2013 but has yet to tell anyone who it is. Trump is expected to make the announcement any time between now and the Republican national convention in Milwaukee, starting on 15 July.\n\nOnce again, the Republican primaries demonstrated Trump\u2019s strength among white men in rural areas, leading to speculation that he will choose a woman or person of colour to broaden his appeal in November. But media reports suggest that he is leaning towards North Dakota\u2019s governor, Doug Burgum, and the Ohio senator JD Vance \u2013 both white men. Then again, Trump loves nothing more than suspense and the element of surprise.\n\nHere are some factors to consider and a look at the likely contenders.\n\nWhy does Trump need a new running mate?\n\nFormer vice-president Mike Pence was a useful ally during the 2016 and 2020 campaigns, a Christian conservative who shored up support among Republicans suspicious of the thrice-married reality TV star. But Pence\u2019s refusal to comply with his boss\u2019s demand to overturn the 2020 election led to a falling-out and made Pence a perceived traitor and target of the January 6 insurrectionists. After a failed bid for president in 2024, Pence recently said in an interview that he will not be endorsing Trump.\n\nWhat is Trump looking for in a 2024 VP?\n\nTrump has said his top consideration for a vice-president is whether they are qualified to take over as commander-in-chief. But history suggests that he will have five priorities: a \u201cfighter\u201d who can take on Democrats; a person who displays absolute loyalty; a candidate from \u201ccentral casting\u201d who performs well on television and will be effective on the debate stage against Kamala Harris; a number two who knows their place and will not outshine him on the campaign trail; a go-getter able to raise vast sums of money for the campaign.\n\nWill Trump\u2019s VP pick matter in the 2024 election?\n\nProbably not a lot. There is little evidence that a woman on the ticket draws more female voters or that a running mate\u2019s home state will necessarily back them. Dan Pfeiffer, a White House communications director under Barack Obama, told the New York Times: \u201cThe vice-presidential pick is something that generates a massive amount of press coverage but has the most minimal of impacts on the election.\u201d\n\nBut perhaps a bad pick can do damage: Republican nominee John McCain\u2019s choice of Sarah Palin in 2008 probably didn\u2019t help. This year, however, Joe Biden and Donald Trump are, again, the two oldest candidates in history, giving new meaning to their VP picks being only \u201ca heartbeat away from the presidency\u201d.\n\nHow many VPs have gone on to become president?\n\nFifteen. Eight of these succeeded to the office on the death of a president, including Lyndon Johnson, who was sworn in onboard Air Force One after the assassination of John F Kennedy. Gerald Ford was the only unelected vice-president and president following the resignations of Spiro Agnew and Richard Nixon. Biden served as vice-president under Barack Obama, who was succeeded by Trump, who was then defeated by Biden for the presidency.\n\nWhat to know about the Republicans on Trump\u2019s vice-president shortlist\n\nView image in fullscreen Photograph: Joe Maiorana/AP\n\nJD Vance\n\nAge: 39\n\nOccupation: Senator for Ohio\n\nThe venture capitalist rose to prominence with his 2016 memoir, Hillbilly Elegy. A one-time Trump critic, he is now an ardent supporter and claims to be fighting for the working class by taking on liberals who \u201cpopulate the upper echelons of American government, business, media, entertainment and academia\u201d. He echoes the former president\u2019s populist views on immigration and an \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy on Ukraine. His friend Donald Trump Jr told Newsmax in January: \u201cI\u2019d love to see a JD Vance. People who are principally in alignment as well as aggressive.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Photograph: Jacquelyn Martin/AP\n\nDoug Burgum\n\nAge: 67\n\nOccupation: Governor of North Dakota\n\nBurgum would be a Pence-like pick: an unflashy governor not likely to steal Trump\u2019s thunder. He would also bring money and wealthy friends to the table. Before his time as governor, Burgum led a software company that was acquired by Microsoft for more than $1bn. He ran against Trump in the Republican primary but has since become one of his most prolific surrogates, appearing frequently on television, joining him at fundraisers and travelling to New York for Trump\u2019s criminal trial. The pair are also said to have hit it off personally.\n\nView image in fullscreen Photograph: Evan Vucci/AP\n\nBen Carson\n\nAge: 72\n\nOccupation: Retired neurosurgeon\n\nBorn in Detroit to a single mother with a third-grade education who worked multiple jobs to support her family, Carson rose to become a leading neurosurgeon \u2013 a life story that the Trump campaign could promote as it seeks to win over aspirational Black votes. As housing secretary, Carson was among Trump\u2019s longest-serving cabinet members.

She campaigned for election-denier Kari Lake and other Republicans in the 2022 midterm elections. Her provocative critiques of the western foreign policy establishment, and her overtures to dictators such as Putin and Syria\u2019s Bashar al-Assad, are likely to resonate with Trump. Asked in March by Fox News if she would consider a vice-presidential slot, Gabbard replied: \u201cI would be open to that.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Photograph: Alex Brandon/AP\n\nKari Lake\n\nAge: 54\n\nOccupation: Candidate for Senate in Arizona\n\nThe firebrand former TV anchor was the breakout Republican star of the midterm elections but lost the race for governor of Arizona, a result she has never accepted. She was endorsed by Trump and continued to repeat his election lies while campaigning as a surrogate for him during the Republican primary. But she may be seen as more valuable running for Senate because she could help Republicans take control of that chamber if she wins.\n\nView image in fullscreen Photograph: Pablo Mart\u00ednez Monsiv\u00e1is/AP\n\nVivek Ramaswamy\n\nAge: 38\n\nOccupation: Business executive\n\nThe former candidate for the Republican presidential nomination is a political neophyte who shook up the Republican primary debates, acting as unofficial Trump surrogate and earning the scorn of Haley. Trump condemned Ramaswamy as \u201cnot Maga\u201d when he gained traction in the opinion polls but has since praised the biotech entrepreneur, who dropped out and threw his weight behind the former president. Ramaswamy is a young person of colour, although his views on the climate crisis are out of step with young voters.\n\nView image in fullscreen Photograph: Reuters\n\nMarco Rubio\n\nAge: 53\n\nOccupation: Senator for Florida\n\nThe former Florida state house speaker was first elected to the Senate in 2010 after stressing his working-class background and \u201cAmerican dream\u201d story as the son of Cuban immigrants who worked as a bartender and hotel maid. Rubio ran for president in 2016, winning the Minnesota primary before dropping out of the race eventually won by Trump, who branded him \u201cLittle Marco\u201d. But in the years since then he has become a case study in the Republican party\u2019s capitulation to Trump, endorsing him for president in January 2024.\n\nView image in fullscreen Photograph: Cj Gunther/EPA\n\nTim Scott\n\nAge: 58\n\nOccupation: Senator for South Carolina\n\nThe Black evangelical Christian made his own bid for the presidency but dropped out two months before the Iowa caucuses, endorsing Trump and telling him: \u201cI just love you.\u201d The senator might be seen as a way to build on Trump\u2019s recent progress among male African American voters. Asked about potential running mates during a Fox News town hall in February, Trump pointed to Scott and said: \u201cA lot of people are talking about that gentleman right over there.\u201d Scott is single but, with impeccable timing, recently presented his girlfriend with an engagement ring.\n\nElise Stefanik\n\nAge: 40\n\nOccupation: Representative for New York\u2019s 21st congressional district\n\nThe New York politician is the highest-ranking woman in the Republican conference in the House of Representatives and one of the first members of Congress to endorse Trump. Once a moderate, she gained national prominence last year after embarrassing the heads of three top universities about antisemitism on their campuses during a congressional hearing, which prompted two of them to later resign. She has also parroted Trump\u2019s use of the term \u201chostages\u201d to describe those convicted of crimes on January 6.",

        "text": "Poll: Election interest hits new low in tight Biden-Trump race\nThe share of voters who say they have high interest in the 2024 election has hit a nearly 20-year low at this point in a presidential race, according to the latest national NBC News poll, with majorities holding negative views of both President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump.\n\nThe poll also shows Biden trimming Trump\u2019s previous lead to just 2 points in a head-to-head contest, an improvement within the margin of error compared to the previous survey, as Biden bests Trump on the issues of abortion and uniting the country, while Trump is ahead on competency and dealing with inflation.\n\nAnd it finds inflation and immigration topping the list of most important issues facing the country, as just one-third of voters give Biden credit for an improving economy.\n\nBut what also stands out in the survey is how the low voter interest and the independent candidacy of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. could scramble what has been a stable presidential contest with more than six months until Election Day. While Trump holds a 2-point edge over Biden head to head, Biden leads Trump by 2 points in a five-way ballot test including Kennedy and other third-party candidates.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Biden has done much as a president. And if Trump gets elected, I just feel like it\u2019s going to be the same thing as it was before Biden got elected,\u201d said poll respondent Devin Fletcher, 37, of Wayne, Michigan, a Democrat who said he\u2019s still voting for Biden.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t feel like I have a candidate that I\u2019m excited to vote for,\u201d Fletcher added.\n\nAnother poll respondent from New Jersey, who declined to provide her name and voted for Biden in 2020, said she wouldn\u2019t be voting in November.\n\n\u201cOur candidates are horrible. I have no interest in voting for Biden. He did nothing. And I absolutely will not vote for Trump,\u201d she said.\n\nDemocratic pollster Jeff Horwitt of Hart Research Associates, who conducted the survey with Republican pollster Bill McInturff of Public Opinion Strategies, said, \u201cAmericans don\u2019t agree on much these days, but nothing unites the country more than voters\u2019 desire to tune this election out.\u201d\n\nThe poll was conducted April 12-16, during yet another turbulent time in American politics, including the beginning of Trump\u2019s criminal trial in New York and new attacks and heightened tensions in the Middle East.\n\nAccording to the poll, 64% of registered voters say they have high levels of interest in November\u2019s election \u2014 registering either a \u201c9\u201d or a 10\u201d on a 10-point scale of interest.\n\nThat\u2019s lower than what the NBC News poll showed at this time in the 2008 (74%), 2012 (67%), 2016 (69%) and 2020 (77%) presidential contests.\n\nThe question dates to the 2008 election cycle. The lowest level of high election interest in the poll during a presidential cycle was in March 2012 \u2014 at 59%. But it quickly ticked up in the next survey.\n\nThis election cycle, high interest has been both low and relatively flat for months, according to the poll.\n\nMcInturff, the Republican pollster, says the high level of interest in the poll has \u201calways been a signal for the level of turnout\u201d for a presidential contest.\n\n\u201cIt makes it very hard for us to predict turnout this far in advance of November, but every signal is turnout will be a lower percentage of eligible voters than in 2020,\u201d he said.\n\nBy party, the current poll shows 70% of self-identified Republicans saying they have high interest in the coming election, compared with 65% of Democrats who say so.\n\nIndependents are at 48%, while only 36% of voters ages 18 to 34 rate themselves as highly interested in the election.\n\n\u201cThey just aren\u2019t low interest,\u201d McInturff said of young voters. \u201cThey are off-the-charts low.\u201d\n\nNBC News poll: Frequently asked questions Who conducts the NBC News poll? Professional pollsters at a Democratic polling firm (Hart Research Associates) and a Republican firm (Public Opinion Strategies) have worked together to conduct and operate this poll since 1989. (Coldwater Corporation served as the Republican firm from 1989-2004.) How is the poll conducted? The polling firms employ a call center, where live interviewers speak by cell phone and telephone with a cross section of (usually) 1,000 respondents. The respondents are randomly selected from national lists of households and cell numbers. Respondents are asked for by name, starting with the youngest male adult or female adult in the household. How does interviewing 1,000 respondents produce a representative sample? One of the common questions that critics ask of polls is, \"I wasn't interviewed, so why should this poll matter?\u201d By interviewing 1,000 respondents and applying minimal weights based on race, ethnicity, age, gender, education and the 2020 presidential vote, the poll achieves a representative sample of the nation at large \u2013 with a margin of error at a 95% confidence level. Who comes up with the questions? NBC News editors and reporters \u2014 along with the pollsters at Hart Research and Public Opinion Strategies \u2014 all work to formulate the questions to try to capture the news and current events NBC is trying to gauge. Both Hart Research and Public Opinion Strategies work to ensure the language and placement of the questions are as neutral as possible.\n\nBiden trims Trump\u2019s lead\n\nThe poll also finds Trump narrowly ahead of Biden by 2 points among registered voters in a head-to-head matchup, 46% to 44% \u2014 down from Trump\u2019s 5-point advantage in January, 47% to 42%.\n\nThe movement, which is within the poll\u2019s margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points, is consistent with what other national polls have found in the Trump-Biden race.\n\nTrump\u2019s biggest advantages are among men (53% to 37%), white voters (54% to 37%) and white voters without college degrees (65% to 25%).\n\nBiden\u2019s top advantages are among Black voters (71% to 13%), women (50% to 39%) and Latinos (49% to 39%).\n\nThe poll shows the two candidates are essentially tied among independents (Biden 36%, Trump 34%) and voters ages 18-34 (Biden 44%, Trump 43%). One of the big polling mysteries this cycle is whether young voters have defected from Biden (as the NBC News poll has found over multiple surveys) or whether Democrats have maintained their advantage among that demographic.\n\nWhen the ballot is expanded to five named candidates, Biden takes a 2-point lead over Trump: Biden 39%, Trump 37%, Kennedy 13%, Jill Stein 3% and Cornel West 2%.\n\nAgain, the result between Biden and Trump is within the poll\u2019s margin of error.\n\nNotably, the poll finds a greater share of Trump voters from the head-to-head matchup supporting Kennedy in the expanded ballot compared with Biden voters, different from the results of some other surveys.\n\n(Read more here about how Kennedy's candidacy affects the 2024 race, according to the poll.)\n\nThe president\u2019s approval rating ticks up to 42%\n\nIn addition, the poll found 42% of registered voters approving of Biden\u2019s overall job performance \u2014 up 5 points since January\u2019s NBC News poll, which found Biden at the lowest point of his presidency.\n\nFifty-six percent of voters say they disapprove of the job he has done, which is down 4 points from January.\n\nBiden\u2019s gains over the past few months have come from key parts of his 2020 base, especially among Democrats and Black voters. But he continues to hold low ratings among Latinos (40% approval), young voters (37%) and independents (36%).\n\n\u201cThe data across this poll show that Joe Biden has begun to gain some ground in rebuilding his coalition from 2020,\u201d said Horwitt, the Democratic pollster. \u201cThe question is whether he can build upon this momentum and make inroads with the groups of voters that still are holding back support.\u201d\n\nBut McInturff, the GOP pollster, points out that the only recent presidents who lost re-election had approval ratings higher than Biden\u2019s at this point in the election cycle: George H.W. Bush (43%) and Trump (46%).\n\n\u201cPresident Biden has a precarious hold on the presidency and is in a difficult position as it relates to his re-election,\u201d McInturff said.\n\nOn the issues, 39% of voters say they approve of Biden\u2019s handling of the economy (up from 36% in January), 28% approve of his handling of border security and immigration, and just 27% approve of his handling of the Israel-Hamas war (down from 29% in January).\n\nVoters gave Biden his highest issue rating on addressing student loan debt, with 44% approving of his handling of the issue, compared with 51% who say they disapprove.\n\nBiden leads on abortion and unity; Trump leads on inflation and competency\n\nThe NBC News poll asked voters to determine which candidate they thought is better on several different issues and attributes.\n\nBiden holds a 15-point advantage over Trump on dealing with the issue of abortion, and he is ahead by 9 points on having the ability to bring the country together \u2014 though that is down from his 24-point advantage on that issue in the September 2020 NBC News poll.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, leads in having the ability to handle a crisis (by 4 points), in having a strong record of accomplishments (by 7 points), in being competent and effective (by 11 points), in having the necessary mental and physical health to be president (by 19 points) and in dealing with inflation and the cost of living (by 22 points).\n\nInflation, immigration are the top 2024 issues\n\nInflation and the cost of living top the list of issues in the poll, with 23% of voters saying they\u2019re the most important issue facing the country.\n\nThe other top voters is immigration and the situation at the border (22%) \u2014 followed by threats to democracy (16%), jobs and the economy (11%), abortion (6%) and health care (6%).\n\nIn addition, 63% of voters say their families\u2019 incomes are falling behind the cost of living \u2014 essentially unchanged from what the poll found in 2022 and 2023.\n\nAnd 53% of voters say the country\u2019s economy hasn\u2019t improved, compared with 33% who say that it has improved and that Biden deserves some credit for it and another 8% who agree the economy has improved but don\u2019t give him credit for it.\n\n\u201cIf I look back to when I had all three of my children in the house \u2014 we only have one child left in the house now, and we\u2019re spending more now than what we did when we had a family of five,\u201d said poll respondent Art Fales, 45, of Florida, who says he\u2019s most likely voting for Trump.\n\nBut on a separate question \u2014 is there an issue so important that you\u2019ll vote for or against a candidate solely on that basis? \u2014 the top responses are protecting democracy and constitutional rights (28%), immigration and border security (20%) and abortion (19%).\n\nIndeed, 30% of Democrats, 29% of young voters and 27% of women say they are single-issue voters on abortion.\n\n\u201cI have a right to what I do with my body,\u201d said poll respondent Amanda Willis, 28, of Louisiana, who said she\u2019s voting for Biden. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t believe that other people should have the ability to determine that.\u201d\n\nOther poll findings\n\nWith Trump\u2019s first criminal trial underway, 50% of voters say he is being held to the same standard as anyone else when it comes to his multiple legal challenges. That compares with 43% who believe he\u2019s being unfairly targeted in the trials.\n\n52% of voters have unfavorable views of Biden, while 53% share the same views of Trump.\n\nAnd Democrats and Republicans are essentially tied in congressional preference, with 47% of voters preferring Republicans to control Congress and 46% wanting Democrats in charge. Republicans held a 4-point lead on this question in January.\n\nThe NBC News poll of 1,000 registered voters nationwide \u2014 891 contacted via cellphone \u2014 was conducted April 12-16, and it has an overall margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.",

That's a change from January, when 42% of voters said they would support Biden, and 47% would support Trump .",
        "text": "Donald Trump leads new 2024 poll, but Joe Biden appears to be closing the gap\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Former President Donald Trump led President Joe Biden by two percentage points in a new national poll from NBC News, though Biden appears to be closing the gap as the 2024 race for the White House heats up.\n\nThe survey, released Sunday, shows Biden polling at 44% and Trump polling at 46%. That's a change from January, when 42% of voters said they would support Biden, and 47% said they would support Trump.\n\nThe poll of 1,000 registered voters, conducted via cellphone from April 12-16, has a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points. Because that margin of error is larger than Trump's apparent advantage, it may be tough to truly determine who has the lead. However, the change between the two NBC News polls indicates a shift in recent months.\n\nTrump had an advantage with men, white voters, and white voters without college degrees, while Biden had an advantage among Black voters, Latino voters and women in the outlet's latest poll. They were effectively tied among independents and young voters.\n\nA USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll released last month also showed Trump holding a slight lead over Biden, 40% to 38%.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nAs the 2024 presidential election draws closer, NBC News' poll showed that inflation and the cost of living, as well as immigration, were the top issues concerning voters.\n\nBut the head-to-head results shifted when voters were offered multiple candidates rather than just Biden and Trump. When third-party candidates Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Cornel West and Jill Stein were added to the mix, 39% of voters chose Biden, and 37% chose Trump. That result is also within the poll's margin of error.\n\nWhen offered the third-party options, more Trump voters than Biden voters chose Kennedy.\n\nThe change comes as Biden's approval rating rose to 42% in April from 37% in January, according to NBC News, though a majority of voters still disapprove of his performance as president.\n\nVoters significantly preferred Biden's stance on abortion to Trump's and said he did a better job on uniting the country. Trump, meanwhile, led on his handling of inflation and the cost of living, perceived competency, and \"having the necessary mental and physical health to be president.\"\n\nNBC's polling also indicated that voters are less interested in this election than they have been in other races in years: Just 64% of respondents said they are \"very interested\" in the election, a measure that GOP pollster Bill McInturff of Public Opinion Strategies described to NBC as \"off-the-charts low.\"\n\nInterest in the election is often an indicator of voter turnout, he said.",

(AP) \u2014 The group gathered inside the conference room, mostly women, fell silent as the audio recording began to play.\n\nThe male voice, clearly agitated, railed against what he thought had been fraud that cost former President Donald Trump reelection four years ago.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re gonna pay for it,\u201d said the man, filling his message with expletives and suggesting his target\u2019s throat be slashed with a knife. \u201cWe will \u2026 take you out. Your family, your life.\n\n\u201cWatch your \u2026 back.\u201d\n\nThe call had been directed at one of their own, a city clerk who had overseen elections in 2020 in suburban Detroit. The former clerk, Tina Barton, played the recording of the call she had received to an audience that included several dozen local election clerks and law enforcement officials who had gathered recently inside an office building conference room in northern Michigan.\n\n\u201cI want you to understand this voicemail is the same type of thing that we\u2019re seeing across the country, and it can find you anywhere you are \u2014 small community, large community, Michigan, Arizona. It can find you,\u201d said Barton, who was overseeing elections in Rochester Hills when she received the voicemail a week after the 2020 presidential election.\n\nWhat to know about Trump\u2019s second term:\n\nStaffing the administration: Here are the people Trump has picked recess appointments Follow all of our coverage as Donald Trump assembles his second administration.\n\nThe recent gathering in Traverse City, a picturesque community on the shores of Lake Michigan in a county that has twice voted for Trump, was part of a national effort to train local election workers on how they can respond to threats and work with law enforcement to counter them.\n\nAs the nation barrels toward another highly charged presidential election, the threats to election offices that have been an alarming consequence of Trump\u2019s false claims about his 2020 loss loom as a perilous wildcard for the thousands of local government workers who will oversee the indispensable infrastructure of the nation\u2019s democracy. The constant threats and harassment have contributed to an exodus of election officials across the country.\n\nTHREATS \u2018ALREADY HAPPENING\u2019\n\nBarton understands the pressure they are under and has been on a mission to help them stay safe. She left her job in Rochester Hills shortly after the 2020 election and later became part of the newly formed Committee for Safe and Secure Elections. Since joining, she has given nearly 100 presentations throughout the country.\n\nEducational materials provided by the Committee of Safe and Secure Elections are pictured at a conference with local election and law enforcement officials Wednesday, April 10, 2024, in Traverse City, Mich.

They are all things that have already happened in some way, shape or form across the country,\u201d Barton tells the group. \u201cTo say, \u2018Oh, that could never happen.\u2019 These things are already happening.\u201d\n\nBarton\u2019s partner in the trainings is Justin Smith, the former sheriff in Larimer County, Colorado, who signed up after retiring last year and hearing directly from local election officials about the onslaught of threats they have faced since 2020.\n\nSmith often speaks directly to the police officers and sheriff\u2019s deputies in the room, explaining the role they play in elections and how the environment has changed since 2020. In past years, election officials were likely to deal with issues on their own, such as protesters or unruly citizens looking to promote their candidates at polling places.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that simple anymore,\u201d Smith tells the group. \u201cWe need to be at the table and be part of the solution.\u201d\n\nTina Barton, a former election clerk, speaks at a conference with local election and law enforcement officials held by the Committee for Safe and Secure Elections, Wednesday, April 10, 2024, in Traverse City, Mich.

One of the scenarios Barton presented to the group mirrors events that unfolded in the days immediately after elections last fall, when local election offices in a handful of states received letters in the mail that contained fentanyl, a highly potent synthetic opioid.\n\nGrand Traverse County Sheriff Michael D.

As one clerk and her deputy sat next to each other, they realized that also was how they opened mail \u2014 together in the clerk\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cIf something were to happen to both of them, where does that chain of command go? For some of you, that might be your whole office,\u201d Barton tells the group.\n\nMichigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, whose office helped sponsor and coordinate the Traverse City training and who also has endured numerous threats, said it\u2019s imperative for law enforcement and election officials to work together to ensure a smooth election in November.\n\nBenson said her office has been providing grants to election offices to help them boost security. The federal government also is engaged in the effort. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency will assess the physical security of local election offices and has written guidance for workers on how to de-escalate tense situations.\n\nSpencer Wood, the federal agency\u2019s regional election security adviser, told the attendees they were not facing the threats alone and praised them as the \u201cfrontline defenders\u201d of the nation\u2019s elections.\n\n\u201cFor more than 200 years, American democracy has withstood a range of physical, cyber and operational risks \u2014 and 2024 will be no different,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018SAD THAT WE ARE AT THIS POINT\u2019\n\nThroughout the training, Barton referenced the election officials who have retired or left the profession, citing the stress since the 2020 presidential election. A survey last year by the Brennan Center for Justice found that about 1 in 5 election workers knew someone who left their election job for safety reasons and nearly three-quarters of local election officials said harassment had increased. Barton emphasized to the clerks the importance of having access to mental health services.\n\nSuzanne Courtade, clerk of East Bay Township, attends a Committee of Safe and Secure Elections conference with local election and law enforcement officials Wednesday, April 10, 2024, in Traverse City, Mich.

She said she faced attacks on her character and demands for her removal.\n\n\u201cI felt attacked, but then I also felt that if I stepped aside, they win,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sad that we are at this point where we have to understand better how to prepare and protect ourselves and our citizens and our workers, but I\u2019m glad that we are able to come together.\u201d\n\nEven as the clerks prepare for November, many of them expressed concerns over what they could face.\n\nThe week before the training session, Trump held a rally two hours south in Grand Rapids. Joining him onstage were a handful of county sheriffs from across Michigan who support him and who heard Trump repeat claims that Democrats \u201ccheat in elections.\u201d\n\nThis past week, a small group of sheriffs from across the country gathered in Las Vegas to join forces with prominent election conspiracy theorists. The group, which calls itself the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association, argues that sheriffs have unlimited power and must investigate elections.\n\nTraverse City Clerk Benjamin Marentette said training sessions like the one in Traverse City are crucial to make sure local election offices and law enforcement are communicating.\n\n\u201cYou can build that trust because everyone \u2013 law enforcement and election officials \u2013 99% of them are there for the right reasons and with a true heart for service,\u201d Marentette said.\n\nMichael D. Shea, the sheriff in Grand Traverse County, said he was surprised at how vulnerable election officials can be because of the requirements associated with their job. A Republican who is on the ballot in the fall, Shea said it was understandable to have some concerns about elections, particularly with the use of technology in parts of the voting process, but said he trusted experts and his local election officials.\n\n\u201cThe goal is a safe, secure, fair election,\u201d said Shea, who attended the training. \u201cAnd we intend to make that happen.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Joey Cappelletti in Grand Rapids, Michigan; Nicholas Riccardi in Las Vegas; Scott Bauer in Madison, Wisconsin, and Ali Swenson in New York contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press receives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein\n\nWASHINGTON, April 20 (Reuters) - Donald Trump's political group that pays his legal bills on Saturday reported spending $3.6 million on lawyer fees in March, draining the finances backing Trump's White House bid as the Republican trailed President Joe Biden at raising money.\n\nTrump's Save America group, which reported the outlays to the Federal Election Commission, is spending money largely raised from small donors, though the funds available could be dwindling.\n\nThe group, which is separate from Trump's campaign but was his biggest fundraising group before he announced his candidacy, reported taking in just over $10,000 from donors in March.\n\nIt was able to cover spending by taking a $5 million refund of money it had previously given a super PAC backing Trump's campaign known as MAGA Inc.\n\nSave America has now clawed back more than $52 million of $60 million it had previously given MAGA Inc, reducing considerably the amount of money MAGA Inc has available for television ads backing Trump.\n\nWhile Save America has not disclosed the details of how much it has spent on each of Trump's legal cases, its filings show that since the start of 2023 it has spent more than $59 million on lawyer fees.\n\nTrump was in court this week as a defendant on charges he falsified business records to cover up hush money payments to a porn start.\n\nHis three other pending criminal trials relate to his efforts to overturn his loss to Biden in the 2020 presidential election and to charges he mishandled classified documents after leaving the White House in 2021. Trump is also appealing a $454 million civil fraud judgment, a threat to his personal finances.\n\nTrump's political operation is also facing monetary challenges, disclosures to the Federal Election Commission showed.\n\nHis campaign reported raising $15 million in March, up from around $11 million February but not enough to make up financial ground with Biden, who has had a persistent edge in fundraising.\n\nBiden's campaign raised more than $43 million in March and ended the month with $85 million in the bank. Trump's campaign said it ended the month with $45 million in cash.\n\nPublic opinion polls show the two locked in a tight race.\n\nCampaign contributions pay for ads, staff and rallies but don't determine the winner. Trump was outraised in 2016 by Democrat Hillary Clinton and still beat her in that year's presidential election.\n\nWhile Trump's money raising among small donors has appeared to flag , Trump in recent weeks has held fundraising events to court big donors, helping the Republican Party raise more than $20 million in March, nearly double what it collected a month earlier, the party reported on Saturday.\n\nMAGA Inc, the super PAC supporting Trump's bid, reported having $33 million in the bank at the end of March, while Future Forward, the main Democratic super PAC backing Biden, reported having over $41 million.\n\nSign up here.\n\nReporting by Jason Lange in Washington; Editing by Cynthia Osterman and Michael Perry\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tab",

        "text": "When it comes to government planes and political trips, who pays for a president\u2019s campaign travel?\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 It\u2019s no simple matter to move the commander in chief from point A to B, and it\u2019s even more complicated when the president is seeking a second term.\n\nPresident Joe Biden recently spent three days in Pennsylvania, a pivotal state in the 2024 campaign, and he plans to be in Virginia and Florida this coming week. The Democratic incumbent is seeking an edge over Republican Donald Trump as he ramps up his travels around the country.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at how much it costs and who pays the bill during the campaign season.\n\nHOW MUCH DOES IT COST?\n\nIt\u2019s not cheap to fly the president\u2019s fleet.\n\nThe White House uses Sikorsky helicopters known as Marine One when the president is aboard, as well as custom Boeing 747s that are immediately recognizable as the iconic humpback Air Force One. (Sometimes the president uses a more modest modified 757 if his destination is nearby or if a runway isn\u2019t long enough to accommodate the bigger plane.)\n\nMarine One costs between $16,700 and almost $20,000 per hour to operate, according to Pentagon data for the 2022 budget year. Air Force One is even more expensive: roughly $200,000 per hour.\n\nBut those figures only scratch the surface of the real cost. There also are military cargo planes that travel ahead of the president to make sure his armored limousines are in place, not to mention the enormous security apparatus that follows the president everywhere.\n\nWhat to know about Trump\u2019s second term:\n\nStaffing the administration: Here are the people Trump has picked recess appointments Follow all of our coverage as Donald Trump assembles his second administration.\n\nNew aircraft are in the works because the current versions are decades old. Sikorsky is producing 23 updated helicopters to serve as Marine One. Boeing is building two new Air Force One planes, and they are scheduled to be finished by 2028. According to the Pentagon, the planes will come with all enhancements, including \u201ca mission communication system,\u201d a \u201cself-defense system\u201d and even \u201cautonomous baggage loading.\u201d\n\nWHO PAYS FOR THE TRAVEL?\n\nWhen the president flies for political purposes, the campaign is supposed to pay the bill. But during an election year, the line between governing and campaigning can be fuzzy.\n\nFor example, Biden held an official event Wednesday in Pittsburgh, where he announced his proposal for higher tariffs on steel imported from China. The event, however, was a not-so-subtle opportunity for the president to rub shoulders with union members who are critical to his reelection, and he jabbed at Trump in his remarks. (At one point Biden joked that the former president was \u201cbusy right now,\u201d a reference to the hush money trial that recently got underway in New York.)\n\nIt\u2019s up to the White House counsel\u2019s office to figure out what percentage of the president\u2019s travels are campaign related. That determines how much the federal government should be reimbursed by the Biden campaign. Sometimes the calculations aren\u2019t straightforward, such as when the White House adds an official event to an otherwise political trip.\n\nNorm Eisen, a White House ethics lawyer under President Barack Obama, said both Republicans and Democrats have usually hewed closely to regulations.\n\n\u201cWe had a set of rules on how to do the allocations,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re intricate, and we stuck to them.\u201d\n\nNo matter what, taxpayers end up on the hook for most of the cost. Campaigns do not pay for all the Secret Service agents and the rest of the security apparatus. In fact, they usually only cover the cost of Air Force One passengers who are flying for explicitly political purposes \u2014 sort of like buying a ticket on a particularly exclusive private jet.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, second from left, boards Air Force One, March 28, 2024, at Andrews Air Force Base, Md.

From January 2023 until the end of last month, they deposited nearly $6.5 million.\n\nSome of that money goes to general campaign logistics, such as staff expenses and advance work. The account is also used to reimburse the federal government for official aircraft used to transport the president, the first lady, the vice president and the second gentleman when they travel for the reelection effort.\n\nPresident Joe Biden boards Air Force One at Andrews Air Force Base, Md., April 12, 2024, enroute to New Castle, Del.

As of the latest data available, just $300,000 has been provided.\n\nIt\u2019s safe to assume that Biden\u2019s campaign will end up forking over much more than that once the campaign is over. Trump\u2019s team reimbursed the federal government nearly $4.7 million for travel expenses during the 2020 race.\n\nBut Biden probably won\u2019t have trouble covering his bills. His campaign and the DNC had more than $192 million in cash on hand at the end of March.\n\n____\n\nAP White House Correspondent Zeke Miller contributed to this report.",

        "text": "Tech & Public Policy program supports research in election misinformation, improving civic tech and the hidden collection of biometric data - McCourt School of Public Policy\nThe Tech & Public Policy program at the McCourt School of Public Policy funds $1.5 million in interdisciplinary research projects to address critical questions about technology\u2019s impact on society.\n\nIn partnership with Project Liberty\u2019s Institute (formerly the McCourt Institute), the McCourt School\u2019s Tech & Public Policy (TPP) 2024/2025 grant program focused on Technology for the Common Good: Understanding, Designing, Developing and Regulating New Technologies. TPP\u2019s grants explore how technology might better protect values such as democracy, freedom and autonomy.\n\nThe TPP program connects threads of research, innovation and engagement to build a vibrant learning community dedicated to examining and advancing policy that addresses the challenges posed by current and future technologies. Through technologists, ethicists, legal scholars and social scientists working in collaboration, TPP grantees consider novel uses and misuses of new digital technologies, their effects on individuals and society, and new governance models to replace outdated regulatory frameworks.\n\nThe 2024-2025 Grantees\n\nBuilding Consensus in the Digital Landscape: The \u201cViewz\u201d Platform Initiative\n\nNejla Asimovic, McCourt School of Public Policy, Georgetown University; Ivan Ivanek, Viewz\n\nConsensus is essential to democratic governance and social cooperation. But polarized settings can make consensus impossible and fuel \u201cus versus them\u201d thinking. This project explores whether technology can be used to highlight divergences of opinion within groups to challenge narratives around homogeneity, among other questions. Using the Viewz platform, a simple online dialogue platform developed by Ivan Ivanek, the research will include a multi-country study that tests different strategies and considers the platform\u2019s potential as a broad model for designing online discourse environments, particularly those that foster a willingness for cross-group collaboration.\n\nBiomanipulation: The Looming Threat Year 2\n\nLaura Donohue, Georgetown University Law Center on National Security\n\nLeft in the shadows, the emergence of biomanipulation could have enormous consequences for contemporary social and political structures. This work aims to understand and illuminate the contours and risks of the emerging field of biomanipulation for researchers, policymakers and, ultimately, end-users. She and her research team will build a patent and scientific research database and publish research papers addressing the theoretical underpinnings and technological scope of biomanipulation.\n\nThe team will also educate key stakeholders and federal and state policymakers on the risks of biomanipulation and develop policies that legislators and policymakers can use to address these risks and control the spread of biomanipulation.\n\nCan Civic Tech Reduce Administrative Burdens and Increase Trust? An Evaluation of Two Public Interest Technology Solutions\n\nPamela Herd, Sebastian Jilke and Don Moynihan, McCourt School of Public Policy, Georgetown University\n\nThis work will encompass two projects that study digital innovations through collaboration with civic tech and government. Both projects focus on how digital innovations can reduce administrative burdens in the social safety net. The first asks what role Artificial Intelligence (AI) can play in supporting case worker decisions in accessing social safety net programs, and the second project asks if such innovations improve trust in government.\n\nRedesigning the Governance Stack: New Institutional Approaches to Information Economy Harms\n\nPaul Ohm, Julie Cohen and Meg Leta Jones, Georgetown University Law Center\n\nThis project is part of a multi-year effort to reinvent the institutions and tools the administrative state uses to govern technology and technology companies, especially given recent advances in AI. This effort will prioritize public accountability and strong public oversight. It will seek to restore and recenter the rule of law within a new institutional framework designed around algorithmically driven information-economy needs and failure modes. It will also be a \u201cfull stack\u201d effort, encompassing the sorts of implementation details of shorter-term projects and extending to rethink fundamental principles of regulatory organization and operation.\n\nExploring the \u201cCollateral Damage\u201d Argument in Internet Censorship Resistance\n\nMicah Sherr, College of Arts & Sciences, Georgetown University\n\nThis project proposes to be the first to consider the ethics of the mechanisms and arguments that serve as the foundation for modern censorship-resistant systems (CRSes). A common approach of CRSes is to disguise users\u2019 attempts to access censored content as requests to allowed resources, such as someone trying to access Amazon Web Services (AWS). The entity that is censoring may choose to block access to AWS en masse which would carry potentially enormous collateral damage since all access to AWS would then be affected. The assumption that CRS designers make is that this collateral damage is too politically, economically or socially expensive for the censor, and thus, the censor will not block the CRS. This is the \u201ccollateral damage argument\u201d that serves as the foundation of most CRS approaches. The ethics of relying on collateral damage to resist Internet censorship has not been studied in the academic literature, despite its serving as a foundation for many commonly used censorship-resistance systems. The central research focus of this project is to improve our understanding of the ethics of the collateral damage argument and quantify its potential impact.\n\nThis interdisciplinary project will tackle the problem of internet censorship from both technical and philosophical directions and focus on two main research thrusts. In thrust 1, the researchers will introduce new methods and models to improve our understanding of how current censorship-resistant systems (CRSes) apply the collateral damage argument and the associated risks to various stakeholders if CRSes\u2019 assumptions fail to hold. Thrust 2 will present a framework for building more ethical CRSes, including the development of principles for obtaining informed consent and the construction of alternative architectures for CRSes that avoid the collateral damage argument entirely.\n\nGenerative AI, Humanness, and Misinformation in the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election\n\nLisa Singh, Department of Computer Science and McCourt School of Public Policy, Georgetown University; Tiago Ventura, McCourt School of Public Policy, Georgetown University; Leticia Bode, Communication, Culture, and Technology, Georgetown University\n\nThis project seeks to understand the nature of content related to the 2024 U.S. presidential election shared on social media platforms on two key dimensions \u2014 the extent to which it is true or misleading and the extent to which it is perceived as human.\n\nMisinformation is important to identify because it could misinform people in ways that could either disenfranchise them, undermine their trust in the electoral process or change their vote choice.\n\nWhile humanness is not a perfect proxy for AI-generated content, it does reflect the typical user experience with that content. A social media user encountering such content will not know whether the content is generated by AI but will be able to perceive whether it feels composed by a human.\u201d\n\nUSDS Founding, Primary Source Archive\n\nEmily Tavoulareas, Tech & Society and McCourt School of Public Policy, Georgetown University; Kathy Pham, Workday and Harvard Kennedy School\n\nThis project aims to create a repository of primary research related to the founding of the United States Digital Service and synthesized assets, such as publications, interviews, reports and more, that scholars can cite in the future.\n\nSign up for the Tech & Public Policy program newsletter here to stay updated on events and news.",

The group's once unchallenged influence in Washington has been diminished by its unwavering backing for the Israeli prime minister over the past 15 years .",
        "text": "The pro-Israel groups planning to spend millions in US elections\nA handful of pro-Israel groups fund political campaigns in support of individual candidates in US elections, led by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac), a powerful force in American politics. Before the 2024 election, Aipac plans to spend tens of millions of dollars against congressional candidates, primarily Democrats, whom it deems insufficiently supportive of Israel.\n\nAipac and other pro-Israel lobby groups have recruited and supported challengers to a number of lawmakers and candidates \u2013 most notably members of the Squad, the group of progressive representatives who are particularly vocal in their criticism of Israel\u2019s offensive in Gaza.\n\nThe 2024 election will be bellwether of the enduring impact of these groups on US politics amid shifting US public opinion on Israel.\n\nWhat is Aipac? Aipac has its roots in the American Zionist Committee for Public Affairs, which was founded by a lobbyist for the Israeli government in an attempt to manage the political fallout the Israeli army\u2019s 1953 massacre of dozens of Palestinians, most of them children and women, in the West Bank village of Qibya. The organisation was renamed Aipac in 1959. It was not until financial support surged after the 1973 Yom Kippur war that it began to grow into the powerful Washington lobbyist group it is today. For many years, Aipac\u2019s influence went largely unchallenged on Capitol Hill. The pressure group claimed to voice bipartisan support for Israel in Congress and worked to marginalise the relatively small number of critics there. Aipac\u2019s annual conference typically involved a long rollcall of members of Congress who support the group. It has regularly galvanised almost every member of the US Senate to sign letters in support of Israeli policies, including several wars in Gaza. But the group\u2019s once unchallenged influence in Washington has been diminished by its unwavering backing for the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, over the past 15 years. It sided with him against President Barack Obama\u2019s opposition to settlement construction in the occupied Palestinian territories and his nuclear deal with Iran. The liberal Tel Aviv newspaper Haaretz has described Aipac as \u201cthe pro-Netanyahu, anti-Israel lobby\u201d. \u201cEffectively, the organization has become an operational wing of Netanyahu\u2019s far-right government, one that peddles a false image of a liberal Israel in the United States and sells illusions to members of Congress,\u201d it said.\n\nWhat has changed? Aipac traditionally endorsed candidates sympathetic to Israel as a signal for others to fund their campaigns. But in December 2021, the group for the first time in its 70-year history moved into direct financial support for individual political campaigns by launching a super political action committee, the United Democracy Project (UDP). A Super Pac is permitted to spend without restriction for or against candidates but cannot make direct donations to their campaigns. The move was prompted by alarm at the erosion of longstanding bipartisan support for Israel in the US. Opinion polls show younger Democrats have grown more critical of the deepening oppression of the Palestinians, including Jewish Americans, a trend that has only strengthened with the present war in Gaza. Aipac has grown increasingly concerned that the election of candidates critical of Israel could open the door to the conditioning of the US\u2019s considerable military aid, erosion of Washington\u2019s diplomatic protection on the international stage, and political pressure to establish a Palestinian state. So the UDP is working to block Democratic candidates critical of Israel at the first hurdle \u2013 the primaries \u2013 in an effort to shore up the claim that there is unswerving support for the Jewish state across Congress. It is also targeting progressive Democratic members of Congress who have pressed for a ceasefire in Gaza.\n\nWhat about other lobby groups? A number of smaller groups are working to the same end, principally the Democratic Majority for Israel (DMFI). It was founded five years ago by Mark Mellman, a Democratic political consultant. The DMFI\u2019s board of directors includes Archie Gottesman, who also co-founded JewBelong, a group that has posted pink billboards in US cities in support of Israel including one that declared: \u2018Trust Me. If Israel Wanted to Commit Genocide in Gaza, It Could\u2019. Notably, the UDP has so far not waded into the campaign against Summer Lee in this year\u2019s primary, despite spending more than $3m to defeat her in 2022. Instead the Republican mega-donor Jeffrey Yass has stepped up as the largest funder of a Pac called Moderate Pac to support Lee\u2019s primary opponent, Bhavini Patel. It is running ads saying that Lee\u2019s criticisms of Biden amount to support for Donald Trump even though Yass himself is a Trump supporter. A more moderate pro-Israel group, J Street, was founded in 2007 to counter Aipac\u2019s unflinching support for rightwing governments. J Street established a Pac to support candidates who back a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine. But it has raised only about $4m so far this election cycle.\n\nWho are they targeting and how? Aipac plans to spend $100m this year against congressional candidates, primarily Democrats, and members of Congress critical of Israel. So far the UDP has raised more than $49m, according to its most recent Federal Election Commission filings. The bulk of that money has yet to be spent but the UDP has already thrown millions of dollars into political advertising targeted against candidates critical of Israel, but which focuses on other issues and fails to make clear that it is funded by a pro-Israel group. Critics have accused Aipac of attempting to intimidate candidates into avoiding criticism of Israel by implicitly threatening to fund campaigns against them. Among those expected to be targeted by pro-Israel groups are members of the the Squad, including Jamaal Bowman and Cori Bush, who are thought to be vulnerable to political attacks over issues unrelated to their criticisms of the war in Gaza.\n\nWho is funding these campaigns? The leading donors to the UDP are Republicans seeking to influence Democratic primaries. The single largest donor is the conservative Ukrainian American billionaire co-founder of WhatsApp, Jan Koum, who gave $5m. Koum also donated to the Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley\u2019s Super Pac. Other donors include the financier, Jonathan Jacobson, who gave $2.5m to the UDP toward the end of last year although for many years his political donations were directed to the Republican National Committee and the party\u2019s US Senate campaigns. The Israeli-born entrepreneur David Zalik gave the UDP $2m. He has also donated to Republican campaigns in Georgia. The Home Depot founder Bernie Marcus, who was one of the largest donors to Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign and who continues to back him financially, gave $1m to the UDP, as did the hedge fund manager Paul Singer, who has given millions of dollars to Republican political causes over the years. Donations to the UDP are separate from tens of millions of dollars in pledges made directly to Aipac in the wake of the 7 October attacks by Hamas as the public relations battle intensified over Israel\u2019s subsequent assault on Gaza and a surging number of Palestinian civilian deaths. Top donors to the DMFI include Deborah Simon, the daughter of the billionaire businessman and movie producer Mel Simon, who gave $1m. She regularly donates to Democratic causes and Jewish organisations such as the Anti-Defamation League. Sam Bankman-Fried, the former cryptocurrency billionaire who is serving 25 years for fraud, gave $250,000 to DMFI during the 2022 midterm elections. The group has been forced to return the money. Other major DMFI donors are closely tied to Aipac such as Stacy Schusterman, who has given more than $1m, and the venture capitalist Gary Lauder.",

        "text": "Meredith Poll Examines Voter Preferences in the General Election, Understanding of Voting Rights, and Views on Sports Gambling Law\nThe most recent Meredith Poll, in the field April 11-17, 2024, featured questions about North Carolina voters\u2019 general election preferences, concerns about barriers to voting, knowledge of voting rights for college students and people convicted of felonies, and views on the state\u2019s new sports gambling law.\n\nThe poll also covered job approvals for U.S. president and N.C. governor, opinions on political polarization, perceptions of the No Labels party, and the direction of the state and country.\n\nHighlights of the Meredith Poll findings are below. For complete results, view the full report.\n\nGeneral Election Preferences\n\nThe Meredith Poll examined the impact of the candidacy of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. on the presidential race. Kennedy recently submitted petitions to the North Carolina Board of Elections that purport to have enough signatures to qualify him to be listed on the state\u2019s General Election ballot.\n\nWhether it was Kennedy\u2019s inclusion on the list of choices available to respondents or not, the presidential race in North Carolina has tightened considerably since February. Donald Trump continues to lead in the poll, but his lead is down to just two points over Joe Biden, with Kennedy garnering the support of nine percent of the respondents.\n\nMeredith Poll Director David McLennan states: \u201cIn a race between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump that is expected to be close, the impact of Robert F. Kennedy could affect the outcome. The demographic groups that most favor Kennedy\u2013young voters, Black voters, and moderate voters\u2013typically support Democrats like Joe Biden. However, the Trump lead over Biden has been reduced to two percent\u2013inside the confidence interval of the poll. Joe Biden has improved his poll numbers with self-proclaimed Democrats, so with just under 200 days until Election Day, we may see the Kennedy effect as marginal.\u201d\n\nRobinson-Stein Matchup\n\nThe general election matchup between Republican Mark Robinson and Democrat Josh Stein has also changed in the Democratic candidates\u2019 favor. Since February, Stein\u2019s lead has grown to nine points over Robinson (from five points). It is significant that Stein is running so far ahead of Joe Biden, suggesting Democrats are not currently being affected by Joe Biden\u2019s poor approval numbers.\n\nStein\u2019s advantage comes from his support among unaffiliated voters and those who self-identify as politically moderate. Robinson gets a lot of support from conservative voters, as is expected, while Stein does well among liberal voters. The other somewhat surprising finding is that Stein has more support from men and women than does Robinson.\n\n\u201cStein\u2019s improved position relative to Robinson may be due to several factors,\u201d said McLennan. \u201cRobinson continues to get negative media coverage of his statements and actions from the past. This enhanced exposure of Robinson\u2019s extreme statements, as well as concerns that some of Robinson\u2019s policy positions, seems to be shifting the unaffiliated voters into Stein\u2019s camp. There are still a significant number of undecided voters (15 percent) as to not cause the Stein campaign to get overconfident.\u201d\n\nPerceptions about Voting Challenges and Knowledge of Voting Laws\n\nChallenges of voting in the past and this year\n\nBy and large, most North Carolinians see voting as an easy process. The Meredith Poll asked questions about possible logistical challenges that voters may have faced in the past or could potentially face this year. Most respondents (54%) indicated that they have not faced challenges in the past and 57 percent say they will not face any logistical challenges in 2024.\n\nThe one issue that came up most frequently as a past concern, as well as a concern for this year, was uncertainty about where to vote. Ten percent of respondents indicated that was an issue in past elections and twelve percent were concerned about finding their polling place this year.\n\nTwo groups of voters\u2013the youngest voters and those with less than a high school diploma\u2013indicated higher levels of concern. About one-in-five of the youngest voters indicated concerns with several issues, like checking their registration status or uncertainty about where to vote.\n\n\u201cNorth Carolina\u2019s voting processes are well run by the state and county boards of elections,\u201d said McLennan. \u201cThe fact that most respondents indicated they did not expect to have issues with voting, even with presenting Voter ID, indicates the success of the boards of elections in communicating the process to voters.\u201d\n\nKnowledge of Voting Rights for People with Felony Convictions and for College Students\n\nThe voting rights of those convicted of criminal felonies is very misunderstood. Only sixteen percent of respondents correctly knew that a person\u2019s voting privileges were restored once they completed their sentence. Almost half (45%) did not know enough to venture a response to the question and 38 percent were wrong in terms of their answers.\n\nThe percentage of our respondents who knew that college students could vote in the county of their college or university was higher than their knowledge of the voting rights of felons (50% correct), eleven percent were wrong, and 39 percent simply did not know the answer.\n\n\u201cAlthough the N.C. Board of Elections is clear in communicating state law on the voting rights of felons and college students, we continue to have a misinformation issue around both,\u201d said McLennan. \u201cOn the issue of felon voting, different states have different laws and some states, like Florida, have attempted to change their laws. This may be part of the confusion.\u201d\n\nPolicy Issue: Sports Gambling\n\nJust before the ACC men\u2019s basketball tournament began, North Carolinians could begin legally betting on all sports through apps on their mobile devices. Hundreds of millions of dollars have been wagered in the state since then. The Meredith Poll aimed to get an early view of this law by asking people how satisfied they are with the law and if they were concerned about the impact of betting on college athletes.\n\nNearly half of respondents (49%) indicated they were satisfied with the law, with 18% stating they were very satisfied. One-third of North Carolinians indicated they were not satisfied with the law, and 18% did not know.\n\nAlthough there were not significant partisan differences in perceptions of the sports gambling laws in the state, there were significant differences in other demographic groups. Many Black respondents were satisfied with the new law, while just over 43 percent of white respondents were. Males indicated significantly higher satisfaction with the law than females.\n\nThe percentage of North Carolinians with little or no concerns about the impact of this new law on college athletes slightly exceeded those with concerns (45-40%). Among respondents, men were more concerned than women about the impact of gambling on college athletes and older respondents were more concerned than younger respondents.\n\n\u201cThis law has been in effect for less than two months. It may be too early to know of its impact, so now there is not a strong majority either for approving the law or about whether it will have a negative impact on college athletes,\u201d said McLennan.\n\nView the full report\n\nMethodology\n\nThe Meredith Poll conducted a survey of North Carolina registered voters. The online sample\u2013from Qualtrics\u2013used a quota based on the most recent U.S. Census and North Carolina Board of Elections estimates of North Carolina. After the survey was completed, we weighted the survey for gender, party affiliation, geographic location, race and ethnicity, and education so that our sample most closely resembles North Carolina.\n\nThe sample had 801 respondents, giving us a confidence interval of +/- 3.5%. The survey was in the field April 11-17, 2024.\n\nAbout Meredith Poll\n\nThe Meredith Poll asks North Carolinians their opinions on a variety of social and political public issues. It is housed in the Department of History, Political Science, and International Studies at Meredith College, one of the largest women\u2019s colleges in the Southeast. The Meredith Poll was launched in the spring of 2015 as part of Meredith\u2019s commitment to civic engagement.",

        "text": "Could Trump lose his right to vote in the 2024 presidential election? Maybe.\nFormer President Donald Trump wouldn't be prevented from returning to the White House even if the he gets convicted of a felony in any of his four criminal trials. But there's still a chance the presumptive Republican nominee's legal troubles could prevent him from casting a ballot for himself in the November general election.\n\nWhile the U.S. Constitution doesn\u2019t explicitly bar felons from serving as president, a number of states do restrict felons\u2019 voting rights. In Florida, where Trump lives, a felon\u2019s right to vote is determined by the rules in the state where they received the conviction.\n\nTrump is facing 88 criminal charges across four cases \u2014 including the New York hush money trial that's set to move on Monday morning into oral arguments, as well as the Mar-a-lago classified documents case, the federal election interference case in the District of Columbia and the Georgia election interference case.\n\nAnd the patchwork of criminal justice laws that govern when convicted criminals can vote in each place where the trials are being held raises questions over whether Trump could lose his right to vote based on the outcomes of the cases.\n\nAustin Sarat, a professor at Amherst College who has studied felon disenfranchisement pointed to \u201cthe multi-jurisdictional quality\u201d of Trump\u2019s trials as making his situation \u201cparticularly complicated.\u201d\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nBut Sarat and other experts emphasized that Trump\u2019s situation isn\u2019t entirely out of the ordinary. Millions of Americans with felony convictions have lost their right to vote. And in states like Florida, where disenfranchisement laws are particularly complicated, many felons have trouble determining whether they can cast a ballot.\n\nDonald Trump trial live updates:Latest from gag order arguments, David Pecker testimony\n\nTrump has opposed efforts to streamline these laws and restore rights to felons in the past, including in Florida.\n\nThe Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment about how the ex-president's views have evolved on the issue since his felony charges, or about the actions he would take if he loses the right to vote.\n\nStill, some advocates, including Neil Volz, deputy director of the Florida Rights Restitution Coalition, say they believe Trump\u2019s trials could bring positive change on the issue.\n\n\"It's like the OJ trial meets NPR,\u201d said Volz, who is a former felon now pushing for rights restoration. \u201cWhat we are seeing is people being more educated on some of the challenges with the criminal justice system and being more open to talking about how we can do things different.\u201d\n\nAs Trump faces the possibility of a felony conviction, here\u2019s a look at how each of his trials could take away his right to vote.\n\nNew York hush money trial\n\nThe chances of Trump losing his voting rights in the New York case are slim.\n\nThe trial, which started with jury selection on April 15, is the first criminal trial in history of a former president. It alleges that Trump falsified business records to hide a hush money payment to an adult film star he made ahead of the 2016 election.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts in the case and, if he is found guilty, legal experts have suggested that his sentence would fall somewhere between probation and four years in prison. The ex-president has pleaded not guilty and is also almost certain to appeal a conviction, a process that could keep him out of incarceration for months as he awaits a final judgment.\n\nThat leaves only a small chance that he\u2019ll lose his vote for the 2024 election as a result of the case.\n\nNew York only removes a felon\u2019s right to vote during the time that they are in prison. Felons who are living in the community remain eligible to participate in elections.\n\nIn other words, Trump would need to be incarcerated during the time of the November election to lose his right to vote because of actions related to the hush money trial. And a prison sentence for the ex-president could look different than it would for a normal person, considering the around-the-clock Secret Service protection he receives.\n\n\u201cIf former President Trump gets a felony conviction, we will be in uncharted territory on these issues,\u201d Volz said. \u201cSome things would need to be litigated that have not been litigated before.\u201d\n\nClassified documents case\n\nTrump could also lose his right to vote in the federal case over his handling of classified documents.\n\nJustice Department special counsel Jack Smith charged Trump with violating the Espionage Act and conspiring to obstruct justice for knowingly retaining hundreds of classified national defense records.\n\nThe case will take place in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida \u2013 meaning, that if Trump is convicted, he\u2019ll be subject to the Sunshine State\u2019s felon disenfranchisement laws.\n\nThe trial was initially slated to begin on May 20, but challenges with managing access to the classified national security-related evidence in the case appear likely to postpone it. The prosecution proposed a start date of July 8, while Trump\u2019s team suggested the trial begin on Aug. 12. If either of those timelines for the case holds, there\u2019s a chance a verdict could come down before the November election.\n\nFlorida is among the handful of states that prevent felons from voting until they have completed their entire sentence \u2014 including probation and parole \u2014 and have paid off all fines.\n\nAlex Saiz, legal director of the Florida Justice Center, suggested that if Trump is convicted in the classified documents case, and his sentence involves more than financial penalties, he\u2019s likely to lose his voting rights.\n\nBut, just as with the New York case, Trump is all but likely to appeal a conviction. Whether he loses his voting rights will depend on when the appeal is made. Saiz suggested that if sentencing is postponed because of an appeal, Trump would retain his right to vote.\n\nElection interference cases\n\nTrump faces four felony counts in Washington, D.C. for conspiring to overturn the 2020 election in a federal case brought by Smith, as well as 10 counts in a Georgia case brought by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis.\n\nTrial dates have not been set for either case, though it's possible the D.C. proceedings get put onto the calendar in the late summer or early fall depending on the timing and outcome of a critical Supreme Court ruling on whether the former president is immune from criminal prosecution. Oral arguments in the Supreme Court case are scheduled for Thursday.\n\nIn Georgia, Willis has said she's ready to bring her case against Trump and his co-defendants to trial well before Election Day 2024. But an appeal is underway on whether the district attorney should be disqualified from the case that a defense lawyer told USA Today might push the trial back until well past the November election. The judge overseeing the case hasn't yet put a trial start date on the calendar.\n\nShould Trump get convicted and sentenced to time served in the Georgia case before the election, he would lose his right to vote. Felons in the state are disenfranchised until they fulfill their sentence, including time in prison and on probation or parole.\n\nTrump's eligibility to vote based on a conviction in the federal election interference case would follow Florida law.",

        "text": "Harris announces final rules on minimum nursing home staffing standards\nThe federal government is for the first time requiring nursing homes to have minimum staffing levels after the COVID-19 pandemic exposed grim realities in poorly staffed facilities for older and disabled Americans.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris announced the final rules on Monday before a trip to La Crosse, Wisconsin, where she will talk to nursing home care employees about their work. In the battleground state, Harris also will hold a campaign event focused on abortion rights.\n\nPresident Joe Biden first announced his plan to set nursing home staffing levels in his 2022 State of the Union address, but his Democratic administration has taken longer to nail down a final rule as health care worker shortages plague the industry. Current law only requires that nursing homes have \u201csufficient\u201d staffing, leaving it up to states for interpretation.\n\nThe new rules implement a minimum number of hours that staff members spend with residents. They also require a registered nurse to be available around the clock at the facilities, which are home to about 1.2 million people. The rules dictate that 80 percent of Medicaid payments for home care providers go to workers\u2019 wages.\n\nREAD MORE: U.S. to regulate nursing home staffing, but minimum requirements are lower than advocates hoped\n\nAllies of older adults have sought the regulation for decades, but the rules will most certainly draw pushback from the nursing home industry.\n\nThe nursing home care event will mark Harris\u2019 third visit to the battleground state this year and is part of Biden\u2019s push to earn the support of union workers. Republican challenger Donald Trump made inroads with blue-collar workers in his 2016 victory. Biden regularly calls himself the \u201cmost pro-union\u201d president in history and has received endorsements from leading labor groups such as the AFL-CIO, the American Federation of Teachers and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.\n\nHarris will gather nursing home care workers at an event Monday joined by Chiquita Brooks-Lasure, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and April Verrett, secretary-treasurer of the Service Employees International Union.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic, which claimed more than 167,000 nursing home residents in the U.S., exposed the poor staffing levels at the facilities and led many workers to leave the industry. Advocates for the elderly and disabled reported residents who were neglected, going without meals and water or kept in soiled diapers for too long. Experts said staffing levels are the most important marker for quality of care.\n\nThe new rules call for staffing equivalent to 3.48 hours per resident per day, just over half an hour of it coming from registered nurses. The government said that means a facility with 100 residents would need two or three registered nurses and 10 or 11 nurse aides as well as two additional nurse staff per shift to meet the new standards.\n\nThe average U.S. nursing home already has overall caregiver staffing of about 3.6 hours per resident per day, including RN staffing just above the half-hour mark, but the government said a majority of the country\u2019s roughly 15,000 nursing homes would have to add staff under the new regulation.\n\nThe new thresholds are still lower than those that had long been eyed by advocates after a landmark 2001 study funded by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, recommended an average of 4.1 hours of nursing care per resident daily.\n\nThe government will allow the rules to be introduced in phases with longer timeframes for nursing homes in rural communities and temporary exemptions for places with workforce shortages.\n\nWhen the rules were first proposed last year, the American Health Care Association, which lobbies for care facilities, rejected the changes. The association\u2019s president, Mark Parkinson, a former governor of Kansas, called the rules \u201cunfathomable,\u201d saying he was hoping to convince the administration to never finalize the rule.",

        "text": "CMS finalizes minimum staffing standards for nursing homes\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services April 22 finalized minimum staffing requirements for nursing homes that participate in Medicare and Medicaid. As proposed in September, the final rule will require nursing homes to provide a minimum of 3.48 hours of nursing care per resident day, including 0.55 hours of care from a registered nurse per resident day and at least 2.45 hours of care from a nurse aide per resident day, as well as 24/7 onsite RN services. CMS slightly expanded the opportunity for facilities to seek exemptions from the requirements from its original proposal. AHA had urged CMS not to finalize the proposal but instead develop more patient- and workforce-centered approaches focused on ensuring a continual process of safe staffing in nursing facilities.\n\n\n\nIn a statement, Stacey Hughes, AHA executive vice president, said, \"The AHA strongly believes that a skilled, caring workforce is integral to delivery of high quality, safe care. Yet, the process of safely staffing any health care facility is about much more than achieving an arbitrary number set by regulation. It requires clinical judgment and flexibility to account for patient needs, facility characteristics and the expertise and experience of the care team. CMS\u2019 one-size-fits-all minimum staffing rule for nursing homes creates more problems than it solves and could jeopardize access to all types of care across the continuum, especially in rural and underserved communities that may not have the workforce levels to support these requirements.\n\n\"This final rule could lead nursing homes to reduce capacity or close outright, including those that are otherwise high performers on quality and safety metrics. The loss of these nursing home beds could adversely impact patients who have completed their hospital treatment and need continuing care in nursing facilities. The AHA has already documented rising lengths of stay for hospital patients in need of skilled post-acute care, with patients waiting days, weeks or even months for post-acute care placements. As those patients continue to occupy hospital beds, other patients awaiting elective surgeries or other scheduled procedures may find their care disrupted because there is no bed for them in the hospital. Even more troubling, this final rule could lead to delays in urgent medical care as patients coming into hospital emergency departments may experience longer waits as EDs and inpatient beds are occupied by patients awaiting nursing home placements.\n\n\"Lastly, this final rule could exacerbate the already serious shortages of nurses and skilled health care workers across the care continuum. Strengthening the health care workforce requires investment and innovation, not inflexible mandates. The AHA will continue to work with Congress and the Administration to advance sustainable approaches to bolstering the health care workforce and delivering high quality, safe, and accessible care.\"",

Since then, jobless numbers have dropped and unemployment is below 4%. Yet, a recent poll conducted by The Economist and YouGov found that more than 50% of participants felt the economy was getting worse overall. And that's important because Americans often rank the economy as a top voting issue.\n\nAll Things Considered spoke with four \"American Indicators\" throughout the Biden presidency, four people in different parts of the country reflecting different parts of the economy. Now that it's an election year, they spoke with NPR again \u2014 this time, to talk about their own politics.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nTravel\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Bhavesh Patel Courtesy of Bhavesh Patel\n\nBhavesh Patel is a franchise hotel owner \u2014 think brands like Comfort Inn and Hampton Inn \u2014 in the Northeast United States. When he first spoke with NPR in 2021, the country was beginning to emerge from the pandemic recession. At the time, he owned seven hotels in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Illinois. In the years since, he has had to downsize.\n\n\"We sold off three properties, so we're down to four now.\"\n\nHe says his two sons, both in their 20s, are pursuing careers in medicine, instead of going into the family business \u2014 and Patel says he can't blame them.\n\n\"It's a tough market to be in right now.\" Patel says. When he graduated from college in 1990, the hotel industry \"was a lucrative business. You didn't have all these rules, regulations, brand specs. But now, things have gotten tighter. It has gotten more complicated to run a hotel.\"\n\nPatel says right now, high-end hotels are doing much better than the midscale places he runs. The wealth gap has continued to grow over the last few years. Between those challenges and tighter regulations, he sometimes wonders whether he should have chosen a different career.\n\n\"I don't want the government telling me how to run my business,\" he says. \"I don't want all these different rules and stipulations out there and whatnot.\"\n\nPatel calls himself a moderate Republican. He voted for former President Donald Trump in 2016, then for President Biden in 2020. And he still hasn't decided who he's going to vote for this time around.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"We will see where the campaign goes and what's to come in the next couple of months.\"\n\nHousing\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Arch City Defenders Courtesy of Arch City Defenders\n\nLee Camp is a housing attorney in St. Louis. In his city, he says, rents keep increasing and the availability of housing is decreasing.\n\n\"I'm certainly not hearing anyone in the renter space, particularly the low-income renter space, excited about the direction of the economy,\" he says.\n\nThings have improved since the summer of 2021, when he first spoke with NPR. At the time, his office's phones were being inundated with people asking for housing assistance, as a pandemic moratorium on evictions ended. In 2024, he says it's still a tumultuous time.\n\n\"What is extremely unfortunate at this point is that the eviction filings themselves are as high as I've ever seen them in my career.\"\n\nAccording to the Eviction Lab, which tracks eviction filings, there were 1,288 eviction filings in the past month, 124% of average filings for the same month before the pandemic.\n\n\"It certainly worries me that still our most vulnerable individuals \u2014 that's renters that are low-income individuals \u2014 are experiencing homelessness, that they're really still having a tough time and that systems like the courts and evictions are still dominating their narrative and their experience of the economy right now.\"\n\nNow, he is encouraged that more of his clients are working or finding new jobs than they were during the pandemic. But Camp points to high consumer prices as an ongoing worry.\n\n\"On the flip side, everything just seems more expensive for [my clients] as well,\" he says. \"And I certainly personally feel that too.\"\n\nCamp says he and his wife can afford the increase in cost of groceries, but they still feel the extra burden. And Camp says there's another thing on his mind when it comes to the economy.\n\n\"One thing that's been substantially changing is the resumption of student loan payments. I love my career. I love that I get to serve people and work alongside so many inspiring and amazing individuals. But the loan payments are back, and that has certainly changed our financial picture in our household.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nHe adds, \"I would encourage [the Biden Administration] to go further, particularly if they get the option to do so in a second term.\"\n\nFood\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of The Just One Project Courtesy of The Just One Project\n\nWhen Brooke Neubauer, founder of the Just One Project, the largest distributor of groceries to at-risk individuals in Nevada, looks at the economy today, she says there are plenty of jobs, but \"what I'm hearing from my clients is that the wages have not caught up with the cost of living.\"\n\nNevada has the second-highest grocery prices in the nation, behind California, with an average of nearly $300 spent on groceries per week.\n\n\"For our clients that are coming in, they're saving on average $250 to $300 a month with us, and they're able to get dairy and produce, meats and poultry and all the things that you and I would get at the store.\"\n\nNeubauer points to systemic issues that make it difficult for people to access food, like food deserts, grocery stores pulling out of lower-income neighborhoods and the closure of hundreds of Family Dollar locations across the country.\n\nThe Just One Project serves about 20,000 people a month. At the peak of the pandemic, the organization was serving about 58,000 people a month, nearly three times as many. And over the years, their organization has felt the rising cost of food, as she told NPR in 2023.\n\n\"Purchasing millions of pounds a year of food, our grocery bill has gone up tremendously, and for us, we purchase in such large quantities, it's hitting us pretty hard.\"\n\nWhen it comes to politics, she wants a president who will invest in social services, particularly for people like her clients.\n\n\"I'm not a fan of a president who is unkind,\" she says. \"And look, I spend my life's work trying to make the world a better place. I spend my time as a mom teaching my kids to be kind and inspiring them to be loving. I couldn't bear to vote for a presidential candidate that was not aligned with my values.\"\n\nNeubauer has voted for both Democrats and Republicans in the past, and she says she has an open mind when going to the polls. But she's decided on this election.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"I just can't fathom that Donald Trump is the best thing that we have come up with to run for president.\"\n\nManufacturing\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Winton Machine Company Winton Machine Company\n\nIn Georgia, Lisa Winton, co-founder of Winton Machine Company, sees herself as a pocketbook voter \u2013 not just for herself, but for the 40 people her company employs.\n\n\"I have those 40 people to think about and I have their families to think about, and then I have my vendors to think about,\" she says. \"So it's hard not to think about those fiscal policies.\"\n\nWinton says last year, the economy looked good \u2014 her company had their best year by 20%, a banner year. As a result, she says her company had looked into opening a second factory, but her lease on her current space nearly doubled, and they had to put those plans on hold.\n\nWinton considers herself \"fiscally conservative and socially liberal,\" which puts her in a frustrating spot.\n\n\"I am not a party voter. I vote for a candidate based on fiscal policies and also based on some social policies as well.\"\n\nAsked which candidate she thinks will get her vote, she answers, \"I am so torn. I don't know yet.\"\n\n\"I'm not happy with the current administration,\" she says. \"I'm not happy with a lot of policies that have been enacted. But I'm also, on a social standpoint, not happy with some policies.\"\n\nUltimately, Winton wants to see a moderate candidate in the White House, and she doesn't feel that either of the options in front of her fit that description.\n\n\"Like so many other voters, I feel like there has to be a better solution.\"",

        "text": "Faculty of Law hosted a lecture by the US professor on \u201cDemocracy in the Courts: the Courts and the 2024 US Presidential Elections\u201d\nOn April 19th the Faculty of Law of Vilnius University hosted a lecture by David Schultz, Professor of Political Science and Law at Hamline University (USA), on \u201cDemocracy in the Courts: the Courts and the 2024 U.S. Presidential Elections\u201d.\n\nThe lecture focused on the role of the courts in the US elections, given that one of the potential candidates is the subject of four criminal trials, and in the context of the ongoing court proceedings on ballot papers and voters\u2019 rights. These processes are particularly relevant given that the winner of the elections will determine the development of democracy in the US and beyond.\n\nProf. Schultz began by teaching the participants the basics about the US presidential election process, which is very different from that of other countries: instead of the candidate with the majority of the electoral votes winning, the US election is determined by a multitude of other processes. One of the main ones is the Electoral College. According to Prof. Schultz, these processes complicate the US presidential election.\n\nAccording to Professor Schultz, it is currently very difficult to predict who will win the 2024 US presidential election, although Donald Trump is facing a criminal conviction. Of course, some voters may change their minds about voting for Mr Trump if he is convicted, but will this prevent him from winning the election? We cannot yet say. Professor Schultz also told the lecture more about the crimes for which Mr Trump is on trial. \u201cStudies show that up to 30% of potential Trump voters would change their minds if Trump were convicted,\u201d stressed Prof Schultz. One of the most interesting constitutional debates on the legal impact of Trump\u2019s conviction is the absence of a pardon in the US Constitution and the potential opportunity for the President-elect to pardon himself.\n\nMr Schultz discussed this and other complex legal debates with the students and experts in attendance. The lecture was followed by a discussion moderated by Associate Professor Dr. Donatas Murauskas, who organised this event, as the head of the The US Law Center.",

        "text": "Trump hush money trial: Jury hears opening statements\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump tried to illegally influence the 2016 presidential election by preventing damaging stories about his personal life from becoming public, a prosecutor told jurors Monday at the start of the former president\u2019s historic hush money trial.\n\n\u201cThis was a planned, coordinated, long-running conspiracy to influence the 2016 election \u2014 to help Donald Trump get elected through illegal expenditures to silence people who had something bad to say about his behavior, using doctored corporate records and bank forms to conceal those payments along the way,\u201d prosecutor Matthew Colangelo said. \u201cIt was election fraud, pure and simple.\u201d\n\nA defense lawyer countered by assailing the case as baseless and attacking the integrity of the onetime Trump confidant who\u2019s now the government\u2019s star witness.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump is innocent. President Trump did not commit any crimes. The Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office should never have brought this case,\u201d attorney Todd Blanche said.\n\nThe opening statements offered the 12-person jury \u2014 and the voting public \u2014 radically divergent roadmaps for a case that will unfold against the backdrop of a closely contested White House race in which Trump is not only the presumptive Republican nominee but also a criminal defendant facing the prospect of a felony conviction and prison.\n\nIt is the first criminal trial of a former American president and the first of four prosecutions of Trump to reach a jury. Befitting that history, prosecutors sought from the outset to elevate the gravity of the case, which they said was chiefly about election interference as reflected by the hush money payments to a porn actor who said she had a sexual encounter with Trump.\n\n\u201cThe defendant, Donald Trump, orchestrated a criminal scheme to corrupt the 2016 presidential election. Then he covered up that criminal conspiracy by lying in his New York business records over and over and over again,\u201d Colangelo said.\n\nThe trial, which could last up to two months, will require Trump to spend his days in a courtroom rather than on the campaign trail, a reality he complained about Monday when he lamented to reporters after leaving the courtroom: \u201cI\u2019m the leading candidate ... and this is what they\u2019re trying to take me off the trail for. Checks being paid to a lawyer.\u201d\n\nTrump has nonetheless sought to turn his criminal defendant status into an asset for his campaign, fundraising off his legal jeopardy and repeatedly railing against a justice system that he has for years claimed is weaponized against him. In the weeks ahead, the case will test the jury\u2019s ability to judge him impartially but also Trump\u2019s ability to comply with courtroom protocol, including a gag order barring him from attacking witnesses, jurors, trial prosecutors and some others.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records \u2014 a charge punishable by up to four years in prison \u2014 though it\u2019s not clear if the judge would seek to put him behind bars. A conviction would not preclude Trump from becoming president again, but because it is a state case, he would not be able to pardon himself if found guilty. He has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.\n\nThe case brought by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg revisits a years-old chapter from Trump\u2019s biography when his celebrity past collided with his political ambitions and, prosecutors say, he scrambled to stifle stories that he feared could torpedo his campaign.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, followed by his attorney Todd Blanche, left, exits the courtroom following proceedings in his trial, Friday, April 19, 2024, at Manhattan Criminal Court in New York.

AP correspondent Julie Walker reports on opening statements in Donald Trump\u2019s hush money criminal trial.\n\nPecker is due back on the stand Tuesday, when the court will also hear arguments on whether Trump violated Judge Juan Merchan\u2019s gag order with a series of Truth Social posts about witnesses over the last week.\n\nIn his opening statement, Colangelo outlined a comprehensive effort by Trump and his allies to prevent three separate stories \u2014 two from women alleging prior sexual encounters \u2014 from surfacing during the 2016 presidential campaign. That undertaking was especially urgent following the emergence late in the race of a 2005 \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d recording in which Trump could be heard boasting about grabbing women sexually without their permission.\n\nColangelo recited Trump\u2019s now-infamous remarks as Trump looked on, stone-faced.\n\n\u201cThe impact of that tape on the campaign was immediate and explosive,\u201d Colangelo said.\n\nWithin days of the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape becoming public, Colangelo told jurors that the National Enquirer alerted Cohen that Stormy Daniels was agitating to go public with her claims of a sexual encounter with Trump in 2006.\n\n\u201cAt Trump\u2019s direction, Cohen negotiated a deal to buy Ms. Daniels\u2019 story in order to prevent American voters from learning that information before Election Day,\u201d Colangelo told jurors.\n\nBut, the prosecutor noted, \u201cneither Trump nor the Trump Organization could just write a check to Cohen for $130,000 with a memo line that said \u2018reimbursement for porn star payoff.\u2019\u201d So, he added, \u201cthey agreed to cook the books and make it look like the payment was actually income, payment for services rendered.\u201d\n\nThose alleged falsified records form the backbone of the 34-count indictment against Trump. Trump has denied a sexual encounter with Daniels.\n\nBlanche, the defense lawyer, sought to preemptively undermine the credibility of Cohen, who pleaded guilty to federal charges related to his role in the hush money scheme, as someone with an \u201cobsession\u201d with Trump who cannot be trusted. He said Trump had done nothing illegal when his company recorded the checks to Cohen as legal expenses.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with trying to influence an election. It is called democracy,\u201d not a crime, Blanche said.\n\nBlanche challenged the notion that Trump agreed to the Daniels payout to safeguard his campaign. Instead, he characterized the transaction as an attempt to squelch a \u201csinister\u201d effort to embarrass Trump and his loved ones.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump fought back, like he always does, and like he\u2019s entitled to do, to protect his family, his reputation and his brand, and that is not a crime,\u201d Blanche told jurors.\n\nThe efforts to suppress the stories are what\u2019s known in the tabloid industry as \u201ccatch-and-kill\u201d \u2014 catching a potentially damaging story by buying the rights to it and then killing it through agreements that prevent the paid person from telling the story to anyone else.\n\nBesides the payment to Daniels, Colangelo also described other arrangements, including one that paid a former Playboy model $150,000 to suppress claims of a nearly yearlong affair with the married Trump. Colangelo said Trump \u201cdesperately did not want this information about Karen McDougal to become public because he was worried about its effect on the election.\u201d\n\nHe said jurors would hear a recording Cohen made in September 2016 of himself briefing Trump on the plan to buy McDougal\u2019s story. The recording was made public in July 2018. Colangelo told jurors they will hear Trump in his own voice saying: \u201cWhat do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?\u201d\n\nTrump denies McDougal\u2019s claims of an affair.\n\nThe first and only witness Monday was Pecker, the then-publisher of the National Enquirer and a longtime Trump friend who prosecutors say met with Trump and Cohen at Trump Tower in August 2015 and agreed to help Trump\u2019s campaign identify negative stories about him.\n\nPecker described the tabloid\u2019s use of \u201ccheckbook journalism,\u201d a practice that entails paying a source for a story.\n\n\u201cI gave a number to the editors that they could not spend more than $10,000\u201d on a story without getting his approval, Pecker said Tuesday.\n\nThe New York case has taken on added importance because it may be the only one of the four against Trump to reach trial before the November election. Appeals and legal wrangling have delayed the other three cases.\n\n___\n\nTucker reported from Washington.\n\n___\n\nFollow the AP\u2019s coverage of former President Donald Trump at https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump.",

Her cookbook, \u201cMade in Taiwan: Recipes and Stories From The Island Nation,\u201d was published in 2023. The views expressed in this commentary are her own.\n\nTaipei CNN \u2014\n\nWhen my parents were growing up in the 1970s, they did not consider Taiwan an idyllic place to start a family. It was under martial law and the steady drumbeat of threats from China only seemed to be getting louder with each passing year. My dad still remembers the anxiety that engulfed the island when the United States cut off diplomatic recognition of Taiwan in favor of the People\u2019s Republic of China in 1979. \u201cWe weren\u2019t sure if America would protect us if there was conflict,\u201d he told me.\n\nAnd so, in their late 20s, they left everything they knew and moved to the suburbs of Los Angeles where I was born. They weren\u2019t the only ones; roughly 20% of Taiwanese college graduates went abroad for advanced study in the 1970s and 1980s. Few returned.\n\n2024: THE VIEW FROM AFAR This article is part of a CNN Opinion series where each month leading up to the US election, a writer in a different country explores how locals view America and why the choice of the next president matters to them.\n\nMy parents considered America a safe haven and wanted me to grow up with all its comforts. Whereas they grew up in cramped moldy buildings, I spent my childhood in a four-bedroom house with a backyard and a swimming pool.\n\nWhereas they walked to school on uneven sidewalks in a cloud of pollution, my mother drove me to school every day in a comfy SUV. My parents were raised under the shadow of martial law, where folks were jailed and killed for speaking their mind. I was raised in the land of the free, where freedom of speech is enshrined in the constitution as a human right.\n\nAnd yet, decades later, I ended up doing the exact opposite of what my parents did. In 2020 at the cusp of the global pandemic, I moved to Taiwan with my husband. Last year, I gave birth to a baby boy in Taipei.\n\nThreats from China have not abated. In fact, tensions have reached such historic highs that Taiwan is often dubbed \u201cthe world\u2019s most dangerous place\u201d by international analysts. This perception is so pervasive that every time my husband and I leave Taiwan, we are greeted with wide-eyed concern by friends and family. Are we safe in Taiwan? Do we think China will attack?\n\nA Taiwanese soldier maneuvers an amphibious vehicle during a two-day military drill to show combat readiness at a base in Kaohsiung, in January last year. Annabelle Chih/Getty Images\n\nThough my perspective may be myopic (given the very real possibility of conflict and a military blockade) and comes from a place of privilege (I am a dual citizen of both Taiwan and the United States), there\u2019s currently nowhere else I\u2019d rather be.\n\nHow Taiwan overtook America\n\nA lot has changed over the past 30 years as Taiwan has transitioned from a dictatorship to a vibrant democracy.\n\nIn Taiwan, power is handed over peacefully while it\u2019s no longer a certainty in the US.\n\nIn Taiwan, guns are illegal. In America, guns are a leading cause of death to children.\n\nTaiwan has universal health care; I can pop into any clinic or hospital for immediate and affordable treatment. My entire medical record can be accessed instantaneously via a chip on my health card. In America, medical insurance is opaque and not guaranteed.\n\nThe contrasts are especially stark now that I am a new mother. The Taiwanese subway system has designated seating areas for pregnant women and children, and there are breastfeeding rooms at every major station.\n\nThe city has free play centers for children stocked with a wide range of toys. All new parents in Taipei are eligible for monthly cash handouts, and certified daycares and at-home nannies services are subsidized by the city government. In the States, only low-income families qualify for financial aid.\n\nOf course, comparing the United States and Taiwan this way without acknowledging the nuanced socio-political contexts can be misleading. While the American health care system is notoriously difficult to navigate, it is far more advanced and state-of-the-art than Taiwan\u2019s.\n\nWhile Taiwan is great for babies, it can be stressful for school-aged children; the education system emphasizes rote memorization and stifles creative freedom. My husband and I are not convinced we want to stay in Taiwan forever, but America, with its shocking lack of family-friendly policies, is on the bottom of the list of places we\u2019d consider moving to.\n\nChildren pose on a sports-themed Metro train in Taipei, marking the city's status as host of the 2017 Summer Universiade, an international sports event for university athletes. Tyrone Siu/Reuters\n\nThinking beyond Trump\n\nMany Taiwanese people still hold the United States in high regard, but more as a military ally and defender of the island. During the 2020 American presidential election, many in Taiwan rooted for Donald Trump specifically because of his aggressive anti-China rhetoric.\n\nDuring this year\u2019s election cycle, however, opinions are much more muted. President Joe Biden has defied skeptics by maintaining a tough stance against China over the last four years and pro-Trump sentiments have waned considerably, especially in light of recent comments by the former president accusing Taiwan of taking away America\u2019s semiconductor business.\n\n\u201cAs long as the United States continues to show both symbolic and substantive support and collaboration with Taiwan, I don\u2019t think Taiwanese people actually care who the next US president is,\u201c Wei-Ting Yen, an assistant professor at Franklin & Marshall College in the US who specializes in Asian countries, told me over a video call.\n\nMy friends in the States are convinced I\u2019m living in a highly volatile and dangerous place. But Taiwanese people harbor similar beliefs about the States. Clarissa Wei\n\nThe biggest shift, then, has been how the people of Taiwan perceive the United States. While it remains a popular immigration destination for those who can afford it, America has lost its luster as a sanctuary. My friends in the States are convinced I\u2019m living in a highly volatile and dangerous place. But Taiwanese people harbor similar beliefs about the States.\n\nRecently at a Chinese medicine shop in Taipei, the owner asked if I felt safe walking down the streets of Los Angeles. He was under the impression that all the major American cities had become wildly unsafe in the last couple of years, rampant with crime and shootings. \u201cAren\u2019t there guns everywhere?\u201d he asked sincerely. \u201cIt sounds so messy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m definitely more comfortable here,\u201d I responded, not wanting to get into the specifics.\n\nHe nodded deeply. \u201cTaiwan is safer,\u201d he said.\n\n\"In Taipei, I can walk down dark alleyways long past midnight with my purse wide open without fear of getting robbed,\" says Clarissa Wei, adding it's something she wouldn't feel comfortable doing in the US. Billy H.C. Kwok/Getty Images\n\nA reverse retirement\n\nIt\u2019s not so much that the United States has become more dangerous (that is the perception, but statistics show otherwise); it\u2019s more that I have gotten used to letting my guard down. In Taipei, I can walk down dark alleyways long past midnight with my purse wide open without fear of getting robbed. I can leave my phone, wallet and laptop on a coffee shop table, go to the bathroom, and be certain that my possessions will all be there when I come back. Some of my friends don\u2019t even lock their front doors. I would not feel comfortable doing any of the above in America.\n\nAccording to last year\u2019s Global Peace Index, Taiwan is the 33rd most peaceful state or territory in the world. The United States, on the flip side, is the 131st.\n\nLast year when my husband and I were in the San Francisco Bay Area for a wedding, our friends instructed us not to not leave anything valuable in the car. Coming from Taiwan, we didn\u2019t think much of the advice, until we were looking for parking one day and noticed all the broken car window glass on the streets.\n\nLately, my parents and many of their friends living in the US have been planning their retirement to Taiwan. Emboldened with dual citizenship and the option of being able to leave the island in the worst-case scenario, they are no longer affected by the anxiety of their youth.\n\nNow in his 60s, my father is convinced the Chinese threat will not materialize. While I don\u2019t agree with him, I understand his point of view. Cross-strait tensions have been strained for seven decades already and, with each passing year, the conflict feels more abstract in spite of the heightened rhetoric and airspace incursions because, eventually, you become numb to it.\n\nChina\u2019s Communist Party considers Taiwan a part of its territory - despite never having controlled it. They have not ruled out force to annex Taiwan.\n\nPeople in a Taipei bar watch former president Donald Trump speaking after he was defeated by Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election. Four years later, both men will again go head-to-head in November's election. Annabelle Chih/NurPhoto/AP\n\nThe possibility of war hangs over like a persistent dark cloud. If you think about it long enough, it makes you nervous and clammy. But because it\u2019s a plausibility, not an immediate reality, it\u2019s easy to ignore. If anything, political violence and upheaval in the States seems far more likely, especially since it would not be unprecedented. On a day-to-day basis, at least, Taiwan seems like the more sensible place to live.\n\nI asked my dad \u2014 a lifelong Republican \u2014 who he believed was a bigger threat this year: Chinese president Xi Jinping or former president Donald Trump.\n\nHe responded without hesitation. \u201cTrump,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause he\u2019s more unpredictable.\u201d",

        "text": "Cannabis a rare consensus issue ahead of US election\nMarijuana use is a rare consensus issue in politically divided America, with polls showing that 88% of Americans support at least partial legalization. But neither of the two main presidential contenders are capitalizing on this, advocates say, with both President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump landing far behind where most Americans are on the issue.\n\nVOA spoke to cannabis advocates on the sidelines of a rare, recent policy summit on the issue, held annually in Washington as a preview to a weekend-long music festival.\n\n\u201cOne thing [both candidates] have in common is that their track records on cannabis have been inconsistent and incremental,\u201d said Caroline Phillips, organizer of the National Cannabis Policy Summit. \u201cWe've heard promises from both administrations, neither of which have panned out in full.\u201d\n\nBiden in 2022 directed the Department of Health and Human Services to take a key step toward legalization by ordering a review of its classification of marijuana as a dangerous controlled substance, on par with heroin and LSD.\n\nNearly a year later, the body recommended moving marijuana to a lighter classification, alongside prescription drugs. That ruling now sits with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, which has the power to act.\n\nBut, Phillips said, many advocates seek the full removal \u2013 or \u201cde-scheduling\u201d \u2013 of the substance from the DEA\u2019s Controlled Substances Act.\n\n\u201cThey have given us great signals that they're willing to shift towards de-scheduling, but most likely re-scheduling,\u201d she said of the Biden administration. \u201cHowever, we haven't quite seen the action to back up their words.\u201d\n\nRe-scheduling puts marijuana on par with prescription drugs and regulates users\u2019 access to it; de-scheduling removes it from the list of controlled substances entirely.\n\nNeera Tanden, director of Biden\u2019s Domestic Policy Council, said the administration sees a need to learn more \u2013 something that re-scheduling the substance would enable by making it more readily available to scientific researchers.\n\n\u201cThere's been a lot of change on this issue for several years,\u201d she told VOA. \u201cIt's important for us to be able to research it more effectively.\u201d\n\nA small but vocal group of anti-cannabis legislators in Congress have also expressed concerns about changing the status of marijuana. Last year, 14 of them \u2013 all Republicans \u2013 sent a letter opposing the effort to loosen its classification.\n\nIn their letter, the group pointed to the potential for addiction and the increased potency of today\u2019s cannabis, saying \u201cfacts indicate that marijuana has a high potential for abuse and that the risk is only increasing.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s position on marijuana, advocates say, is hazy. The pro-legalization Marijuana Policy Project says he \u201cnever brought the issue up proactively\u201d as president. Since leaving office, Phillips said, \u201cwe've heard him both say that people who sell drugs in the illicit market should be jailed and even put to death.\u201d\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump has largely avoided the issue, said Morgan Fox, political director for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, known as NORML.\n\n\u201cWe haven't heard too much from the Republican nominee so far,\u201d he said.\n\nThe personal becomes political\n\nThe candidates\u2019 attitudes, Fox said, are out of step with those of many Americans, and lean on old tropes about marijuana that paint users as prone to mania \u2013 like in the 1936 film \u201cReefer Madness\u201d \u2013 or use fear as a tool, like the 1980s-era Drug Abuse Resistance Education program.\n\n\"Luckily, with the advent of the internet and the development of a lot more communication around these issues, people have not only been able to see that the policy of prohibiting cannabis and criminalizing cannabis consumers is nonsensical, but they've also been able to really see the human impact that it has had,\u201d he said.\n\nFor entrepreneur William Davis, this is personal. With his pressed jeans, alligator-skin boots, crisp white cowboy hat and penchant for replying to questions with \u201cyes, ma\u2019am,\u201d he knows he does not cut the figure of a stereotypical cannabis user.\n\n\u201cIt's a lot of people that you would never think,\u201d he said.\n\nFor years, the Iraq war veteran struggled with PTSD and opioid addiction. He was reluctant to accept a friend\u2019s recommendation that he try cannabis, he said, because to him it evoked a wildly popular 1980s ad that showed a frying egg, and a stern admonition: \u201cThis is your brain on drugs.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike in a hot pan with the egg, I thought, \u2018Nah, I don\u2019t wanna try drugs, I\u2019m gonna fry my brains,\u2019\u201d Davis said.\n\nInstead, he said, marijuana produced a revelation. Davis says he uses CBD, the non-psychoactive compound found in marijuana, to soothe his anxiety during the day, and the active component, THC, for relaxation after work.\n\nSix years ago, he founded a company, Euphoria Eats, that sells infused hot sauce and barbecue sauce.\n\n\n\nDavis, who is from Houston but now lives in solidly Republican Louisiana, said he supports legalization for business reasons.\n\n\u201cUntil this will be decriminalized and legal everywhere, there will always be hesitant individuals who are afraid to put their money into a lucrative business that they see is making money, that they see is making an impact on the community,\u201d he told VOA.\n\n'My vote influences cannabis laws'\n\nPolls show that the greatest pro-cannabis momentum comes from younger Americans.\n\nCommunity organizer Scotty Smart spoke to VOA about his position as a young progressive, which was summarized neatly on his moss-green T-shirt that read: \u201cMY VOTE INFLUENCES CANNABIS LAWS.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think cannabis is an issue that ignites and excites young people to pay attention,\u201d said Smart, who works with the nonpartisan New Georgia Project and with a pro-marijuana education and awareness movement called We Want all the Smoke.\n\nA key factor that young voters are watching for, he said, is whether the Biden administration moves forward with the process of downgrading cannabis.\n\n\u201cHopefully that takes place before the election so we can really see, have something to go off of and not just have election speeches giving us hope,\u201d he said.\n\nMaya Tatum, former chair of the national grassroots group Students for Sensible Drug Policy, agreed that the candidates\u2019 actions matter more than their words. Neither man, she said, is a clear winner here.\n\n\u201cA lot of the young voters that I'm around are wanting to hold Joe Biden accountable for what he said,\u201d in support of cannabis, she said. \u201cI don't personally feel like there's a lot that Trump is offering as it relates to cannabis.\u201d\n\nFox said NORML would like to see political aspirants be more open about cannabis on the campaign trail.\n\n\u201cAny candidate that actually wants to get ahead \u2013 whether it's in the presidential election in Congress or state legislatures or local legislators \u2013 if they ignore this issue, it's going to be at their peril,\u201d he said.\n\nVeronica Balderas Iglesias contributed to this report from Washington.",

With only six months before ballots are cast, emotions are running high as the nation prepares for one of the most consequential elections in history. ThinkNow tapped into the pulse of likely voters with a nationwide online quantitative survey, uncovering the attitudes and trends shaping this pivotal moment in American democracy.\nDownload the report here.\nThe survey, which reached 2,000 Americans and 1,443 likely voters, highlighted a significant level of engagement among various demographic groups. While approximately 80% of Non-Hispanic Whites, Asians, and African Americans expressed their intention to vote, around 70% of Hispanics indicated the same. Despite historical patterns suggesting a potential gap between reported intentions and actual turnout, the demographic differences align closely with past trends.\nNot everyone, however, is interested in voting. Among the top explanations cited was the lack of appealing candidates, with Gen Zers exhibiting the lowest interest in politics overall. Furthermore, Baby Boomers and Non-Hispanic Whites were most likely to express dissatisfaction with the current slate of candidates.\nOne of the survey's most notable findings was the even split among likely voters between Republican and Democratic candidates. In pivotal swing states such as Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, and Michigan, Republican candidates held a clear edge, potentially tipping the scales in favor of the GOP. If actual voting results were to match current survey results, the Republican party would obtain the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House.\n\nInterestingly, if Michigan, with its 15 electoral votes, were to vote for the Democrats, they would retain the White House.\nWhen it comes to sourcing information about candidates, traditional media outlets such as TV news and news websites remain the primary channels for likely voters. However, social media and conversations with family and friends also play a significant role, particularly among younger demographics and certain ethnic groups.\nInterestingly, the choice of information sources varied across swing states, reflecting each region's diverse media landscapes and campaigning strategies.\nAmidst a myriad of issues, the economy emerged as the foremost concern for likely voters nationwide. Healthcare, social security, and immigration also ranked prominently among voters' priorities, highlighting the multifaceted nature of electoral decision-making. Notably, Republican and Democratic voters exhibited divergent priorities, with the economy, immigration, and a strong military resonating strongly among the former, while healthcare and gun laws were top issues for the latter.\nFurthermore, generational disparities on issues were evident, with Millennials prioritizing anti-poverty initiatives and LGBTQ+ rights. Gen Xers and Boomers, on the other hand, focused more on traditional concerns like abortion and national security. Gen Z cares more about student loan repayment than other groups by a wide margin. In swing states, variations in issue salience were observed, reflecting each region's unique socio-political landscapes and demographic compositions and the need to target messaging at the local level.\nDespite the impending electoral showdown, concerns lingered regarding the fairness and integrity of the electoral process. Alarmingly, less than half of likely voters expressed confidence in the upcoming elections' fairness, with Republican voters exhibiting the highest levels of skepticism. Surprisingly, a substantial proportion of Hispanics voiced doubts about the election's fairness, underscoring the need for enhanced efforts to bolster confidence and transparency in the electoral system.\nAs the 2024 Presidential Election approaches, the insights gleaned from ThinkNow's survey offer a snapshot of the diverse perspectives and priorities shaping the American electorate as they currently exist. Public opinion will certainly shift in the coming months, but these findings can provide valuable guidance for candidates, policymakers, and stakeholders navigating the intricacies of current American electorate. Ultimately, democracy is founded on the principles of participation and representation. With an evenly divided electorate, the outcome of the coming election will be determined by the enthusiasm each party can generate.\nDownload the report here.\nWe use different types of cookies to optimize your experience on our website.

With only six months before ballots are cast, emotions are running high as the nation prepares for one of the most consequential elections in history. ThinkNow tapped into the pulse of likely voters with a nationwide online quantitative survey, uncovering the attitudes and trends shaping this pivotal moment in American democracy.\nDownload the report here.\nA Diverse and Engaged Electorate\nThe survey, which reached 2,000 Americans and 1,443 likely voters, highlighted a significant level of engagement among various demographic groups. While approximately 80% of Non-Hispanic Whites, Asians, and African Americans expressed their intention to vote, around 70% of Hispanics indicated the same. Despite historical patterns suggesting a potential gap between reported intentions and actual turnout, the demographic differences align closely with past trends.\nNot everyone, however, is interested in voting. Among the top explanations cited was the lack of appealing candidates, with Gen Zers exhibiting the lowest interest in politics overall. Furthermore, Baby Boomers and Non-Hispanic Whites were most likely to express dissatisfaction with the current slate of candidates.\nSeven States Poised to Determine Election Outcome\nOne of the survey's most notable findings was the even split among likely voters between Republican and Democratic candidates. In pivotal swing states such as Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, and Michigan, Republican candidates held a clear edge, potentially tipping the scales in favor of the GOP. If actual voting results were to match current survey results, the Republican party would obtain the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House.\u00a0\n\n\n\nInterestingly, if Michigan, with its 15 electoral votes, were to vote for the Democrats, they would retain the White House.\nTV News Still Rules\nWhen it comes to sourcing information about candidates, traditional media outlets such as TV news and news websites remain the primary channels for likely voters. However, social media and conversations with family and friends also play a significant role, particularly among younger demographics and certain ethnic groups.\n\nInterestingly, the choice of information sources varied across swing states, reflecting each region's diverse media landscapes and campaigning strategies.\nThe Economy Takes Center Stage\nAmidst a myriad of issues, the economy emerged as the foremost concern for likely voters nationwide. Healthcare, social security, and immigration also ranked prominently among voters' priorities, highlighting the multifaceted nature of electoral decision-making. Notably, Republican and Democratic voters exhibited divergent priorities, with the economy, immigration, and a strong military resonating strongly among the former, while healthcare and gun laws were top issues for the latter.\nFurthermore, generational disparities on issues were evident, with Millennials prioritizing anti-poverty initiatives and LGBTQ+ rights. Gen Xers and Boomers, on the other hand, focused more on traditional concerns like abortion and national security. Gen Z cares more about student loan repayment than other groups by a wide margin. In swing states, variations in issue salience were observed, reflecting each region's unique socio-political landscapes and demographic compositions and the need to target messaging at the local level.\nChallenges to Electoral Confidence\nDespite the impending electoral showdown, concerns lingered regarding the fairness and integrity of the electoral process. Alarmingly, less than half of likely voters expressed confidence in the upcoming elections' fairness, with Republican voters exhibiting the highest levels of skepticism. Surprisingly, a substantial proportion of Hispanics voiced doubts about the election's fairness, underscoring the need for enhanced efforts to bolster confidence and transparency in the electoral system.\nIn Conclusion\nAs the 2024 Presidential Election approaches, the insights gleaned from ThinkNow's survey offer a snapshot of the diverse perspectives and priorities shaping the American electorate as they currently exist. Public opinion will certainly shift in the coming months, but these findings can provide valuable guidance for candidates, policymakers, and stakeholders navigating the intricacies of current American electorate. Ultimately, democracy is founded on the principles of participation and representation. With an evenly divided electorate, the outcome of the coming election will be determined by the enthusiasm each party can generate.\nDownload the report here.\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest blog\n\nCultivating Customer Loyalty Through Relationship Design\n\n\n\nThe Evolution of E-Commerce in Mexico\n\n\n\nFrom TV to Twitch: Navigating the Evolving Media Landscape\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nListen us\n\nThe New Mainstream Podcast\nListen now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Us\nPress\nCareers\n \n\nFollow us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nListen to us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCall us\n1-818-843-0220\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2024 Thinknow.

Despite historical patterns suggesting a potential gap between reported intentions and actual turnout, the demographic differences align closely with past trends.\nNot everyone, however, is interested in voting. Among the top explanations cited was the lack of appealing candidates, with Gen Zers exhibiting the lowest interest in politics overall. Furthermore, Baby Boomers and Non-Hispanic Whites were most likely to express dissatisfaction with the current slate of candidates.\nSeven States Poised to Determine Election Outcome\nOne of the survey's most notable findings was the even split among likely voters between Republican and Democratic candidates. In pivotal swing states such as Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, and Michigan, Republican candidates held a clear edge, potentially tipping the scales in favor of the GOP. If actual voting results were to match current survey results, the Republican party would obtain the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House.\u00a0\n\n\n\nInterestingly, if Michigan, with its 15 electoral votes, were to vote for the Democrats, they would retain the White House.\nTV News Still Rules\nWhen it comes to sourcing information about candidates, traditional media outlets such as TV news and news websites remain the primary channels for likely voters. However, social media and conversations with family and friends also play a significant role, particularly among younger demographics and certain ethnic groups.\n\nInterestingly, the choice of information sources varied across swing states, reflecting each region's diverse media landscapes and campaigning strategies.\nThe Economy Takes Center Stage\nAmidst a myriad of issues, the economy emerged as the foremost concern for likely voters nationwide. Healthcare, social security, and immigration also ranked prominently among voters' priorities, highlighting the multifaceted nature of electoral decision-making. Notably, Republican and Democratic voters exhibited divergent priorities, with the economy, immigration, and a strong military resonating strongly among the former, while healthcare and gun laws were top issues for the latter.\nFurthermore, generational disparities on issues were evident, with Millennials prioritizing anti-poverty initiatives and LGBTQ+ rights. Gen Xers and Boomers, on the other hand, focused more on traditional concerns like abortion and national security. Gen Z cares more about student loan repayment than other groups by a wide margin. In swing states, variations in issue salience were observed, reflecting each region's unique socio-political landscapes and demographic compositions and the need to target messaging at the local level.\nChallenges to Electoral Confidence\nDespite the impending electoral showdown, concerns lingered regarding the fairness and integrity of the electoral process. Alarmingly, less than half of likely voters expressed confidence in the upcoming elections' fairness, with Republican voters exhibiting the highest levels of skepticism. Surprisingly, a substantial proportion of Hispanics voiced doubts about the election's fairness, underscoring the need for enhanced efforts to bolster confidence and transparency in the electoral system.\nIn Conclusion\nAs the 2024 Presidential Election approaches, the insights gleaned from ThinkNow's survey offer a snapshot of the diverse perspectives and priorities shaping the American electorate as they currently exist. Public opinion will certainly shift in the coming months, but these findings can provide valuable guidance for candidates, policymakers, and stakeholders navigating the intricacies of current American electorate. Ultimately, democracy is founded on the principles of participation and representation. With an evenly divided electorate, the outcome of the coming election will be determined by the enthusiasm each party can generate.\nDownload the report here.\n\n\nLatest blog\n\nCultivating Customer Loyalty Through Relationship Design\n\n\n\nThe Evolution of E-Commerce in Mexico\n\n\n\nFrom TV to Twitch: Navigating the Evolving Media Landscape\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nListen us\n\nThe New Mainstream Podcast\nListen now\nLatest blog\n\nCultivating Customer Loyalty Through Relationship Design\n\n\n\nThe Evolution of E-Commerce in Mexico\n\n\n\nFrom TV to Twitch: Navigating the Evolving Media Landscape\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nListen us\n\nThe New Mainstream Podcast\nListen now\nLatest blog\n\nCultivating Customer Loyalty Through Relationship Design\n\n\n\nThe Evolution of E-Commerce in Mexico\n\n\n\nFrom TV to Twitch: Navigating the Evolving Media Landscape\nCultivating Customer Loyalty Through Relationship Design\n\nThe Evolution of E-Commerce in Mexico\n\nFrom TV to Twitch: Navigating the Evolving Media Landscape\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter\n\nListen us\n\nThe New Mainstream Podcast\nListen now\nThe New Mainstream Podcast\nListen now\nAbout Us\nPress\nCareers\n \n\nFollow us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nListen to us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCall us\n1-818-843-0220\nAbout Us\nPress\nCareers\nFollow us\nListen to us\nCall us\n1-818-843-0220\n\u00a9 2024 Thinknow.

        "text": "A look at small businesses in the U.S.\nA small-business owner organizes display tables at her yarn shop in Boston. (Erin Clark/The Boston Globe via Getty Images)\n\nMost U.S. adults (86%) say small businesses have a positive effect on the way things are going in the country these days, according to a recent Pew Research Center survey. Small businesses, in fact, receive by far the most positive reviews of any of the nine U.S. institutions we asked about, outranking even the military and churches.\n\nDespite their name, small businesses loom large in the United States. These businesses \u2013 defined here as those with 500 employees or fewer \u2013 account for 99.9% of U.S. firms, according to the Small Business Administration. While most of these 33 million firms don\u2019t have paid employees, about 6 million of them do. They account for just under half of total private sector employment (46%).\n\nAs National Small Business Week approaches, here\u2019s a look at small businesses in the U.S. and public attitudes about them, based on federal data and Center surveys.\n\nHow we did this Pew Research Center conducted this analysis to provide a glimpse into the state of American small businesses ahead of National Small Business Week. In this analysis, \u201csmall businesses\u201d are defined as employer firms with fewer than 500 workers. The analysis relies primarily on data from several Census Bureau sources: the Annual Business Survey (ABS), the Business Dynamics Statistics (BDS), and the Business Formation Statistics (BFS). The ABS \u2013 conducted annually since 2017 \u2013 includes all non-farm U.S. firms with paid employees and receipts of $1,000 or more. Majority business ownership is characterized in the survey as having 51% or more of the stock or equity in the firm. The Census Bureau counts multiracial firm owners under all racial categories they identify with; Hispanic firm owners may be of any race. Read more about the ABS methodology. Data on the age of small business comes from the BDS. Data on the annual number of high-propensity business applications in the United States is based on the number of Employer Identification Number applications used for tax purposes and is not seasonally adjusted. Read more about the BFS methodology. Per capita calculations use state-level resident population data from the Census Bureau; estimates are as of July 1, 2023. This analysis also draws on findings from recent Center surveys. More information on the methodology for these surveys can be found by following the links in the text.\n\nA note on defining \u2018small businesses\u2019 There\u2019s no single way to define a \u201csmall business.\u201d Economists sometimes use the size of the establishment or firm, or turn to industry-specific size standards based on average revenue. For this analysis, we\u2019ve used the U.S. Small Business Administration\u2019s broadest definition: employer firms with fewer than 500 workers. An establishment is a business with one physical location. A firm is a business organization that may have multiple locations (i.e., multiple establishments).\n\nJust how \u2018small\u2019 are small businesses?\n\nAmong the roughly 6 million small businesses with employees, 49% have just one to four workers, according to the latest estimates for 2021 from the Census Bureau\u2019s Annual Business Survey (ABS). About a quarter (27%) have between five and 19 employees; 8% have 20 to 99; and just 1% have 100 to 499 workers. The remaining 14% had paid employees at some point during the year, but not during the March 12 pay period, which the ABS uses to determine employment size.\n\nOverall, small businesses employed an estimated 56.4 million workers in 2021 and brought in over $16.2 trillion in revenue, according to ABS data. Perhaps unsurprisingly, small businesses with more employees tend to account for larger shares of overall revenue than those with fewer workers.\n\nWho owns and runs small businesses?\n\nSome small businesses are family-owned, but the vast majority are not. Among small businesses that reported this type of information for 2021, 27% were family-owned and 73% were not.\n\nSo-called \u201cmom and pop shops\u201d account for a relatively modest share of small businesses for which information is available. Overall, 10% of small businesses in the U.S. were jointly owned and operated equally by spouses in 2021. Another 11% were jointly owned by spouses but separately operated, with men more likely than women to serve as primary operators.\n\nFranchises aren\u2019t very common among small businesses. Just 5% of small businesses that reported this information were fully or partially operated as franchises in 2021.\n\nIn terms of demographics, men own a greater share of small businesses overall. About six-in-ten small businesses (61%) were majority-owned by men in 2021, while 22% were majority-owned by women. Another 14% were owned equally by men and women. (The ABS defines majority ownership as having at least 51% equity in the firm.)\n\nLooking at small businesses where estimates of majority owners\u2019 race and ethnicity are available, most (85%) had majority-White ownership in 2021. Smaller shares were majority-owned by Asian Americans (11%), Hispanic adults (7%), and Black or African American adults (3%). About 1% were estimated to have either American Indian and Alaska Native, or Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander majority owners.\n\nRelated: A look at Black-owned businesses in the U.S.\n\nDespite owning small shares of these firms overall, many Black and Asian Americans see entrepreneurship as a marker of success, according to Center surveys.\n\nFor example, 30% of Asian Americans say owning a business is important to their own view of the American dream, according to a Center survey conducted from July 2022 to January 2023. And 36% of Black adults say owning a business is important to their personal definition of financial success, with another 22% saying it\u2019s essential, according to a September 2023 survey.\n\nStill, Black and Asian Americans are more likely to place emphasis on other measures asked about in these surveys, such as owning a home, having a good family life and being debt-free, among others.\n\nHow old are most small businesses?\n\nMany small businesses have stood the test of time. In 2021, the majority of these firms (59%) had been operational for at least six years, according to the Census Bureau\u2019s Business Dynamics Statistics. This includes 15% that had been in business for more than 25 years.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, about a third of small businesses (35%) had been running for five years or fewer in 2021, including 9% that had launched in the last year. (The bureau could not determine the age of the remaining 6% of firms.)\n\nHow often do new businesses open?\n\nSmall businesses have reported financial and staffing challenges in the years following the coronavirus pandemic. But federal data reveals the staying power of entrepreneurship in the U.S.\n\nThe number of high-propensity business applications \u2013 those that are highly likely to turn into businesses with payrolls \u2013 remained relatively stable between 2009 and 2019, according to Census Bureau data. But the number of applications has risen since before the pandemic: There were nearly 1.8 million high-propensity business applications in 2023, up from about 1.3 million in 2019.\n\nOn the state level, places with larger populations saw the most high-propensity business applications in 2023. Florida (225,809) topped the list, followed by California (221,571), Texas (151,888), New York (131,206) and Georgia (80,403). But Missouri, Wyoming, Delaware, Florida and Colorado had the most applications per capita that year.",

The defendant, Donald Trump, orchestrated a criminal scheme to corrupt the 2016 presidential election, then he covered up that conspiracy by lying in his New York business records over, and over, and over again,\u201d Colangelo argued, according to journalists present.\n\nThe New York court does not permit audio or video recording but will provide daily transcripts on its website.\n\nCalling him \u2018President Trump\u2019\n\nDefense attorney Todd Blanche argued for Trump, whom he said will be referred to as \u201cPresident Trump\u201d throughout the trial \u201cout of respect\u201d and because he \u201cearned\u201d the title.\n\nBlanche told the jurors \u201cPresident Trump is innocent. President Trump did not commit any crimes. The Manhattan district attorney should never have brought this case.\u201d\n\nClaiming that Trump was unaware of the nuances of the payments, Blanche argued, \u201cYou\u2019ll learn that President Trump had nothing to do with any of the 34 pieces of paper \u2026 except he signed the checks.\u201d\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg charged Trump with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in the first degree for each reimbursement payment to Cohen.\n\nBlanche also told the jurors to dismiss the prosecution\u2019s election interference theory: \u201cI have a spoiler alert: there\u2019s nothing wrong with trying to influence an election, it\u2019s called democracy,\u201d he said, according to reporters in the courthouse.\n\nTrump raised his fist and did not take questions as he left the courtroom for a brief recess after opening statements, according to reporters.\n\nNational Enquirer exec called\n\nThe prosecution called David Pecker, former chairman of the tabloid National Enquirer\u2019s parent company, as its first witness Monday. Pecker was involved in the scheme with Cohen to identify and purchase, nicknamed \u201ccatch and kill,\u201d damaging stories about Trump ahead of the 2016 election.\n\nThe prosecution is also expected to call Cohen, who has already served prison time in relation to the payments, and Hope Hicks, a former Trump campaign press secretary.\n\nThe trial could last for longer than a month, possibly two, keeping the presumed 2024 Republican presidential nominee off the campaign trail four days a week.\n\nThe New York proceeding also overlaps with Trump\u2019s immunity arguments scheduled for Thursday before the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThe former president claims he enjoys absolute criminal immunity for his actions while in office, including immunity from special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s charges that he allegedly schemed to subvert the 2020 presidential election results, culminating in a violent attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nNew York Judge Juan Merchan denied Trump\u2019s request to attend the Supreme Court arguments, saying he must be present at his Manhattan trial, according to media reports.\n\nIn early morning posts to his social media platform Truth Social, Trump blamed President Joe Biden \u2014 despite the case being at the state level \u2014 and repeated his refrain that the trial is politically motivated. He wrote, partially in all caps, that he will now be \u201cSTUCK in a courtroom, and not be allowed to campaign for President of the United States!\u201d",

One hundred per cent,\" Mr Lassonde said.\n\nIf those predictions come to pass, it could have a transformative impact on the Australian gold sector, which for years has enjoyed a healthy buffer against the US dollar exchange rate.\n\nThe entry statement at Kalgoorlie-Boulder Airport claims the title of gold capital of Australia. (ABC Goldfields: Jarrod Lucas)\n\nGold is touted as the ultimate store of value and in periods of global turmoil, prices have typically gone up.\n\nAmid rising interest rates, an upcoming US presidential election and wars in Ukraine and the Middle East \u2014 all of which have come hot on the heels of a global pandemic \u2014 and it is fair to say there is no shortage of global uncertainty.\n\n\"Gold is a safe haven that investors will gravitate to during times of uncertainty,\" private wealth investor Phil George told ABC Perth.\n\n\"When investors might be concerned about what's happening with equity prices, or they might be concerned about what the share market's doing, or property markets, and obviously geopolitical risks.\"\n\nPhil George is a regular guest on ABC Perth's Money Matters segment. (ABC Perth)\n\nWhy is the price going up?\n\nPut simply, demand is driving up prices.\n\nJohn O'Donoghue, depository general manager at the Perth Mint, which is Australia's biggest refiner of precious metals, said an increasing number of people wanted to open an account and trade with the mint.\n\n\"With gold in the media spotlight, it definitely gets people more interested in purchasing gold,\" he said.\n\n\"When the price is running hot, as it is at the moment, that sees existing customers looking to maybe top up their allocation and brings new customers to the table.\n\n\"Additionally, we will see some people looking to sell out and realise some gains.\"\n\nThe Perth Mint sold 16,442 ounces of gold and 860,672 ounces of silver in minted form in March 2024. (Supplied: Perth Mint)\n\nHowever, he said most of the demand for the Perth Mint's products was from overseas, from institutions.\n\nVeteran resources commentator Tim Treadgold said that was happening across the board.\n\n\"It's coming from a number of directions, particularly from the world's central banks, which are getting a bit edgy about owning too many US dollars or the currency of other countries,\" he said.\n\n\"It's coming from private investors, particularly in China, who are worried about the state of their country's economy.\n\n\"And it's just building up pressure in gold. And it's finally breaking up.\"\n\nAnthony Albanese takes a selfie with staff at the Super Pit gold mine during a visit in 2023. (ABC Goldfields: Jarrod Lucas)\n\nMr George said it was gold's ability to hold value that attracted buyers.\n\n\"It's a very attractive hedge against inflation, which is another way of saying, protecting the buying power that your wealth gives you today,\" he said.\n\n\"A fall in the confidence that consumers have in the value of the dollars that they hold, because they've been diluted, essentially ... they start selling dollars and they buy gold, which is the ultimate store of value.\"\n\nHe said post-COVID inflation had boosted gold's allure.\n\nThrow in some geopolitical uncertainty and central banks wanting to ensure their reserves were solid and you have a perfect storm.\n\nSandra Close says conflict and crises usually prove positive for the price of gold.\n\nAccording to Melbourne-based mining consultancy Surbiton, Australian gold miners produced a combined 304 tonnes of gold last year.\n\nThe result, worth about $32 billion at current metal prices, was down from 313 tonnes in 2022.\n\nSurbiton director Sandra Close said while gold production was off nearly 3 per cent, it was due to miners blending in lower grade ore amid higher prices.\n\n\"It's really nothing to worry about with this decline on an annual basis, because gold prices have been going up and up,\" she said.\n\n\"When they rise, a lot of operators reduce their head grades. But what they're doing is maximising their gold output over the life of their mine.\"\n\nGold bars being stamped at the Mungari operation near Kalgoorlie. (Supplied: Evolution Mining)\n\nBillionaire bullish on gold\n\nDuring the 1980s, when gold prices boomed in Australia, Mr Lassonde founded the world's biggest gold royalty company, the New York Stock Exchange-listed Franco-Nevado Corporation.\n\nIn Western Australia, it collects royalties from various operating mines, including South Kalgoorlie and the Duketon, Bronzewing and Wiluna mines in Western Australia's northern Goldfields.\n\nPierre Lassonde is predicting gold prices will rise significantly over the next year. (Credit: Lassonde Entrepreneur Institute at the University of Utah)\n\nMr Lassonde said demand was being driven from investors of all sizes.\n\n\"Who's buying gold? It's the family offices, it's the people who are buying physical gold and putting it in the vault and that is their insurance against the deterioration of the US dollar,\" he said.\n\n\"For sure there is a premium in the gold price because of the Middle East situation. How much of a premium? Maybe 10 per cent.\"\n\nLoading YouTube content\n\nHe said central banks bought more than 1,200 tonnes of gold, equivalent to one-third of global production.\n\n\"The first two months of this year, gold imports through Hong Kong were 372 tonnes,\" he said.\n\n\"If you annualise that, that's two-thirds of all the gold produced this year is going into Hong Kong. That's absolutely incredible.\"\n\nHe said the Chinese appetite for gold was stemming from the inability to invest in real estate and cryptocurrency and he expected the demand to continue for several years.\n\nDarren Stralow, left, shakes hands with WA Mines Minister David Michael at the opening of state's newest gold mine in the northern Goldfields. (ABC News: Rachel Pupazzoni)\n\nAussie miners finally benefit\n\nAlmost 70 per cent of Australia's total gold production comes from WA, which has seen significant flooding in recent months.\n\nDespite that, and miners cashing in on higher prices by processing lower grade ore, Mr O'Donoghue said refining figures had so far remained the same.\n\n\"We haven't seen a drop in the amount of gold we're receiving from our customers. What we've received so far is in line with our expectations.\" he said.\n\nThe Perth Mint turned over $23 billion last year, and Mr Donoghue believed that number was likely to be significantly higher this financial year.\n\n\"We would expect that to be the case, but we'll have to wait until the end of the financial year to get the final numbers,\" he said.\n\nThe price of gold has soared to record highs this year. (ABC News: John Gunn)\n\nMr Lassonde said for miners, the galloping spot price for the shiny precious metal had surprisingly not equated to higher share prices.\n\n\"The margin that these companies are going to provide is enormous and yet the stocks are barely moving,\" he said.\n\nIn recent weeks, that has started to change and Kelly Carter, chair of WA's independent Gold Industry Group, said that allowed miners to plan for their future.\n\n\"There's obviously significant investment in exploration at the moment,\" she said.\n\n\"This not only allows for the extension of mine life of existing mines in the state ... and brownfields exploration, but I think more excitingly, it really does support that investment in greenfields exploration, which is obviously a significant part of the future of mining.\n\n\"Every producer at the moment will be looking at how they can best capitalise on the higher prices.\"\n\nKelly Carter hopes gold miners invest in the future during the current high prices. (Supplied)\n\nMs Carter said that may mean mining additional material that would have otherwise not been economic, skills and training development, and investments in the communities that surrounded their operations.\n\n\"But what we need to do is make sure that we're positioned in order to continue to sustain those activities when current prices come off, which inevitably, they will,\" she said.\n\nBut for the moment, gold is having another moment in the sun.\n\n\"I think, in a balanced portfolio, 8 to 10 per cent gold feels about right, and maybe that's a combination of bullion and gold equities,\" Mr George said.\n\n\"It's a good 21st present too. If you really want to chip in for it, you can buy little mini bars.\"",

        "text": "Census Bureau Releases 2022 Congressional Election Voting Report\nAPRIL 23, 2024 \u2014 The voter registration rate (69.1%) for the 2022 congressional election was the highest registration rate of a midterm election in 30 years. However, the voter turnout rate (52.2%) was lower than in the 2018 (53.4%) midterm elections, according to the new Voting and Registration in the Election of November 2022 report released today by the U.S. Census Bureau. The report, based on data from the 2022 Current Population Survey (CPS) Voting and Registration Supplement, builds on detailed tables released earlier this year.\n\nThe report highlights patterns in voter turnout over time among the citizen voting-age population (CVAP) and explores how demographic groups were over- and under-represented among voters in the 2022 congressional elections compared to the CVAP as a whole.\n\nHighlights:\n\nNon-Hispanic White population those with a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher education, and those 65 years or older were each overrepresented among voters in 2022. (Non-Hispanic White and 65 years or older voter overrepresentations were not statistically different.)\n\nThe 65 years or older group was overrepresented among voters by 6.7 percentage points, comprising 30.4% of all voters and 23.8% of the CVAP, while voters ages 18 to 29 were underrepresented by 7.9 percentage points, comprising 11.7% of all voters and 19.6% of the CVAP.\n\nThe report further examines these differences at the state level. In Wisconsin, where 21.2% of the CVAP were between 18 and 29 years old, voters in this age group were not statistically underrepresented. This is in contrast with Texas, where 21.4% of the CVAP were 18 to 29 years old but this age group was underrepresented by 10.2 percentage points (Wisconsin and Texas 18- to 29-year-old CVAP shares were not statistically different.) When looking at the CVAP by race, non-Hispanic Black voters were underrepresented by 1.6 percentage points nationally, a greater underrepresentation for this group than in the previous three congressional elections (non-Hispanic Black voters were not statistically underrepresented in 2010.) This underrepresentation varied at the state level, however.\n\nThe rate of early voting or voting by mail was 49.8% in 2022, 10.0 percentage points more than in 2018. The share of voters who used one or both these methods to vote increased across all age groups, race and Hispanic origin, and education level between these two elections.\n\nOther highlights from the report include:\n\nRegistered voters who did not vote in the midterm election (37.2 million people) were most likely to cite being too busy or having a conflicting schedule as their reason for not voting (9.9 million).\n\nThose in the CVAP who were not registered to vote (32.5 million people) were most likely to cite a disinterest in the election (13.3 million) as their reason for not being registered to vote.\n\nThe Census Bureau has collected voting and registration data since 1964 and has fielded the Voting and Registration Supplement to the CPS every two years. This survey is the most comprehensive data source available on the social and demographic composition of the electorate in federal elections. Examining these characteristics and how they have changed over the years provides a better understanding of the social and demographic characteristics of American voters. More information on methodology, confidentiality protection, sampling and nonsampling error, and definitions is available at https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/cps/techdocs/cpsnov22.pdf.\n\nThe estimates presented in this report may differ from those based on administrative data or exit polls due to factors such as survey nonresponse, vote misreporting, methodological issues related to question wording, and survey administration.\n\nFor detailed tables and data from previous presidential election years, visit the Voting and Registration webpage.\n\nNo news release associated with this product.

(Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nHow we did this Pew Research Center conducted this analysis to better understand Americans\u2019 long-range foreign policy priorities. For this analysis, we surveyed 3,600 U.S. adults from April 1 to April 7, 2024. Everyone who took part in this survey is a member of the Center\u2019s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. This way nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. Read more about the ATP\u2019s methodology. Here are the questions used for this analysis, along with responses, and its methodology.\n\nAmericans have a lot on their plates in 2024, including an important election to determine who will remain or become again president. But the world does not stop for a U.S. election, and multiple conflicts around the world as well as other issues of global prominence continue to concern Americans.\n\nWhen asked to prioritize the long-range foreign policy goals of the United States, the majority of Americans say preventing terrorist attacks (73%), keeping illegal drugs out of the country (64%) and preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction (63%) are top priorities. Over half of Americans also see maintaining the U.S. military advantage over other countries (53%) and preventing the spread of infectious diseases (52%) as primary foreign policy responsibilities.\n\nAbout half of Americans say limiting the power and influence of Russia and China are top priorities. A recent annual threat assessment from the U.S. intelligence community focused heavily on those countries\u2019 strengthening military relationship and their ability to shape the global narrative against U.S. interests.\n\nFewer than half of Americans say dealing with global climate change (44%) and getting other countries to assume more of the costs of maintaining world order (42%) are top priorities. The partisan gaps on these two issues are quite large:\n\n70% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say climate change should be a top priority, while 15% of Republicans and Republican leaners say this.\n\n54% of Republicans say getting other countries to assume more of the costs of maintaining world order should be a top priority, compared with 33% of Democrats.\n\nAbout four-in-ten Americans see limiting the power and influence of North Korea and Iran as top priorities. (The survey was conducted before Iran\u2019s large-scale missile attack on Israel on April 13.) And about a third say the same about the U.S. being a leader in artificial intelligence, a technology that governments around the world are increasingly concerned about.\n\nWhen it comes to goals that focus on international engagement, like strengthening the United Nations and NATO or finding a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, fewer than a third of Americans mark these as top foreign policy priorities.\n\nRelated: Fewer Americans view the United Nations favorably than in 2023\n\nOnly about a quarter of Americans prioritize promoting human rights in other countries, leading other countries in space exploration and reducing military commitments overseas. And similar shares say supporting Ukraine (23%) and Israel (22%) are top issues.\n\nAt the bottom of this list of foreign policy priorities are promoting global democracy (a major policy push from the Biden administration) and aiding refugees fleeing violence around the world \u2013 about two-in-ten Americans describe these as top concerns. These assessments come amid a recent global surge in asylum claims. Still, in Center surveys, democracy promotion has typically been at the bottom of Americans\u2019 list of foreign policy priorities, even dating back to George W. Bush\u2019s and Barack Obama\u2019s administrations.\n\nOverall, a majority of Americans say that all 22 long-range foreign policy goals we asked about should be given at least some priority. Still, about three-in-ten Americans say supporting Israel (31%), promoting democracy (28%) and supporting Ukraine (27%) should be given no priority.\n\nThe long-range foreign policy priority questions were also asked in 2018 and 2021, and since then there have been some significant shifts in responses:\n\nSince 2018, the public has become significantly more likely to say limiting the power and influence of China (+17 percentage points) and finding a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict (+11) are top foreign policy priorities.\n\nAmericans have also increased the emphasis they place on limiting the power and influence of Russia, particularly in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine (+8 points since 2021).\n\nOn the decline since 2018 are strengthening the UN and aiding refugees (-8 points each), reducing foreign military commitments (-6), and promoting and defending human rights in other countries (-5).\n\nPreventing the spread of infectious diseases is down 19 percentage points since 2021 \u2013 during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic \u2013 and about back to where it was in 2018.\n\nThese are among the findings from a Pew Research Center survey conducted April 1-7, 2024.\n\nThe survey of 3,600 U.S. adults shows that foreign policy remains a partisan issue. Republicans prioritize the prevention of terrorism, reducing the flow of illegal drugs into the country, and maintaining a military advantage over other nations. Meanwhile, Democrats prioritize dealing with climate change and preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs), but also preventing terrorist attacks.\n\nThere are also stark age differences on many of the policy goals mentioned, but for the most part, young adults are less likely than older Americans to say the issues we asked about are top priorities. The exceptions are dealing with climate change, reducing military commitments overseas, and promoting and defending human rights abroad \u2013 on these issues, 18- to 29-year-olds are significantly more likely than older Americans to assign top priority.\n\nEven with these priorities, foreign policy generally takes the backset to domestic policy for most Americans: 83% say it is more important for President Joe Biden to focus on domestic policy, compared with 14% who say he should focus on foreign policy.\n\nAmericans are even less likely to prioritize international affairs than they were in 2019, when 74% wanted then-President Donald Trump to focus on domestic policy and 23% said he should focus on foreign policy.\n\nDifferences by partisanship\n\nAmericans\u2019 foreign policy priorities differ greatly by party. The largest divide, by a significant margin, is the 55 percentage point gap between Democrats and Republicans on dealing with global climate change (70% vs. 15%, respectively, see it as a top priority).\n\nSupporting Ukraine, aiding refugees, reducing the spread of diseases, protecting human rights, and strengthening the UN are also issues on which Democrats are at least 20 points more likely than Republicans to prioritize. For example, 63% of Democrats say reducing the spread of infectious diseases is a top priority, compared with 41% of Republicans.\n\nRepublicans prioritize supporting Israel, reducing the flow of illegal drugs and maintaining a military advantage over other countries \u2013 among other security and hard power issues \u2013 significantly more than Democrats do. For example, more than half of Republicans (54%) say getting other countries to assume more of the costs of maintaining world order should be a top focus in foreign policy. Only a third of Democrats say the same.\n\nThe priority assigned to several issues is divided even further by ideology within parties. Take support for Israel and Ukraine as examples. Supporting Israel is generally a higher priority for Republicans than Democrats, but within the Republican Party, 48% of conservatives say it\u2019s a top concern, while 18% of moderates and liberals agree. Previous Center research shows that conservative Republicans are especially likely to favor military aid to Israel.\n\nSupporting Ukraine, something Democrats emphasize more than Republicans, is a top priority particularly for liberal Democrats (47%), while about three-in-ten moderate and conservative Democrats agree (29%). Democrats have also shown more willingness than Republicans to provide aid to Ukraine in its conflict with Russia.\n\nGenerally, the partisan differences on the importance of several foreign policy issues have gotten smaller since 2021, when most of these questions were last fielded. This is especially true for items related to the relative power of major countries, like the U.S. maintaining a military advantage and limiting the power and influence of both Russia and China.\n\nHowever, finding a solution to the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians \u2013 a priority that saw no partisan difference at all when it was last asked about in 2018 \u2013 has an emerging partisan gap today. The share of Democrats who call this a top priority has more than doubled, while the share of Republicans has changed little.\n\nDifferences by age\n\nAge differences persist on foreign policy issues. Older Americans prioritize most of the issues we asked about at higher rates than those ages 18 t0 29.\n\nOn four issues, there is at least a 40 percentage point gap between Americans ages 65 and older and young adults ages 18 to 29. The oldest Americans are more likely to prioritize reducing the flow of illegal drugs, limiting the power and influence of China and Iran, and maintaining a U.S. military advantage.\n\nThose in the oldest age group are also more concerned than their younger counterparts on an additional 11 issues, ranging from support for Israel to U.S. leadership in space exploration.\n\nFor their part, young adults are more likely to say dealing with global climate change, reducing U.S. military commitments overseas, and promoting and defending human rights in other countries should be top foreign policy priorities.\n\nEven starker patterns appear when looking at partisanship within two age groups \u2013 adults ages 18 to 49 and those 50 and older.\n\nAmong Democrats, older adults place particularly high priority on supporting Ukraine, strengthening NATO, and limiting the power and influence of Russia amid its war with Ukraine. Older Democrats are also more likely than younger ones to prioritize preventing the development of WMDs, curbing the spread of diseases, strengthening the UN and promoting democracy around the world, among other issues.\n\nAmong Republicans, those ages 50 and older are more likely than those ages 18 to 49 to prioritize supporting Israel, limiting the power and influence of Iran and China, getting other countries to assume more foreign policy costs, reducing the amount of illegal drugs entering the U.S., preventing terrorism, and maintaining a military advantage.",

        "text": "The states to watch on the 2024 electoral map\nThe states to watch on the 2024 electoral map\n\nLoading...\n\nTo better understand the landscape for the presidential election with a little more than six months to go, here is our initial Electoral Vote map of the cycle.\n\nIt focuses on the states that are expected to be most competitive in the effort by the campaigns to get to 270 electoral votes, a majority of the 538 total available.\n\nThere are a number of paths each candidate can take to victory. Follow them here.\n\nThis analysis, which will appear and be adjusted semi-regularly until Election Day, goes beyond just polling and is based on conversations with campaigns and strategists, NPR reporting from the field, campaign activity, and historical and demographic trends.\n\nIt lays out which direction the states are leaning at this point and are organized into seven categories \u2014 Toss Up, Lean Republican, Lean Democratic, Likely Republican, Likely Democratic, Safe Republican and Safe Democratic.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Mark Felix/AFP via Getty Images Mark Felix/AFP via Getty Images\n\nState analysis and ad spending\n\nTrump holds slight advantages in most of the swing states right now, according to averages of the polls. Strictly going by the polls, Trump would have a 283-255 lead (if you give Biden Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, which are currently statistical ties).\n\nBut the toss up states are expected to be close, within just a few points, in either candidate's direction. Biden currently has a massive war chest and ad-spending advantage. In addition to personnel, ads are the largest expenditure of a presidential campaign.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThird-party scramble\n\nIt's also unclear how third-party candidates could affect the map. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been pulling double digits in polling, and it's not totally clear which side he pulls most from. Polls have shown him pulling evenly, some have shown him pulling more from Trump, others more from Biden. The Biden campaign would prefer a one-on-one matchup with Trump and super PACs are cropping up on the left to attack Kennedy's record.\n\nHe's qualified so far for the ballot in three states \u2014 Michigan, Hawaii and Utah. A Quinnipiac poll last month showed Trump's lead expanding from 3 to 5 points when RFK Jr. was included. Kennedy's campaign and a super PAC supporting him say he has enough signatures to potentially also get on ballots in Arizona, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Nevada, North Carolina and South Carolina.\n\nThe state of play in the states\n\nIn Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, Biden has caught up, pulled even or taken a lead in some recent surveys. And Pennsylvania happens to be where Biden and allies are spending the second-most on ads right now \u2014 almost $4 million in the past month and a half since Super Tuesday, the unofficial start to the general election.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThat's only slightly behind what they're spending in Michigan. Biden is trying to make up ground there with younger voters and Black voters, groups he's lagging with. Trump and groups supporting him have spent only about $700,000 in Pennsylvania in that same time frame.\n\nTeam Biden has also spent $2 million in Wisconsin. Trump and groups supporting him have spent nothing there so far.\n\nLoading...\n\nMost of the money in this election is going to be poured into seven states, and they fall into two familiar buckets \u2014 the so-called \"Blue Wall\" states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and the Sun Belt states of Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina and Nevada.\n\nThe Blue Wall states are home to significant shares of white, working-class voters, but Biden has retained strong support with unions. Democrats are also putting in significant efforts, especially in Wisconsin, to reach Black voters and be on college campuses. All three states have significant Black populations and multiple colleges and universities.\n\nWhile North Carolina was also close in 2020 \u2014 within 2 points \u2014 given its history of voting Republican, it begins the cycle in the Lean Republican category. Democrats feel the gubernatorial race in the state could help them, as Republicans nominated a highly controversial candidate, who could turn off swing voters.\n\nThe increasing population of white, college-educated voters in the state's Research Triangle continues to make the state competitive. But Republicans have won it in all but one presidential election since 1976.\n\nDemographics are important but it isn't everything\n\nThe industrial Midwest has moved more toward Republicans because of the shift toward the GOP among white voters without college degrees. That's why states like Ohio and Iowa, which were competitive for decades until the Trump era, are no longer Democratic targets.\n\nIt's the key group Trump is targeting. But they are declining as a share of the population and of the electorate. That's a big reason Trump lost despite whites without degrees voting at a higher rate in 2020 (64%) compared to 2016 (55%), according to data from Michael McDonald, the preeminent turnout expert in the country and professor at the University of Florida.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIt's also because of the continued shift with college-educated white voters toward Democrats. In 2020, Trump won college-educated white men by 3 points in 2020, according to exit polls, but the latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll showed Biden winning the group by more than 20 points.\n\nCombined with the increasing Latino and Asian American population and a remigration to the South of young Black voters, particularly in Georgia, that has meant a reshaping of the electoral map.\n\n\"In 2024, we'll see an even more diverse electorate than we saw in 2020, which was even more diverse than 2016 and more diverse than 2012,\" McDonald predicted.\n\nConsider that 20 years ago, Republican George W. Bush won Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Nevada, New Mexico and North Carolina. That's all changed, as each is either competitive or clearly in the Democratic column.\n\nIn addition to the Latino population increase in the Southwest, McDonald pointed to the uptick in Asian Americans, and a remigration of Black voters to Georgia as to why those states continue to trend toward Democrats.\n\nBut it's not all demographics. Latinos, Black voters and young voters all view the economy negatively. Majorities overall disapprove of Biden's handling of the economy and more voters say they think the economy was better under Trump.\n\n\"Issues matter as well,\" McDonald noted. \"But the sort of issues that can move a sizable chunk of the electorate change with the demographics. And so that's where the two things intersect.\"\n\nPost-pandemic election realities\n\nThis year's election is also going to be different from 2020 in a very big way. Because of the pandemic, mail-in voting was used widely and that contributed heavily to increased turnout. In 2020, 66% of registered voters cast ballots, the highest since 1900. That's unlikely to be the case again, McDonald noted.\n\n\"I would be very surprised if we have a turnout rate like we saw in 2020,\" McDonald said. \"And the people who would most likely then not participate ... are going to be these lower-education voters. And so it's going to pose a real challenge to the Trump campaign, to energize these folks yet again to vote in 2020.\"\n\nNOTES: President Biden is headed to Tampa, Fla., this week for a campaign event. Campaigns will say that nothing is more precious than a candidate's time, and that stops in a particular state can move numbers. Because of an abortion-related ballot measure in the state, Democrats think they can make Florida competitive. That may be, but it's incredibly expensive because it's such a large state with so many TV markets. In 2020, the Biden team spent more than $150 million in Florida, more than any state, to no avail. To this point, the Biden campaign has spent almost nothing in ads on the state and the polling has, to this point, shown Trump well ahead. For now, it ranks decidedly below the most competitive states. Texas is a majority-minority state, but remains something of a white whale in Democratic politics. In 2020, it was the closest it has been since 1996, decided by 7 points. But with other paths to 270 and how expensive Texas is to advertise and organize in, expect the core seven states to be the focus.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Andrew Harnik/AP Andrew Harnik/AP\n\nPaths to 270\n\nAs the map stands, if Trump and Biden win the states leaning in their direction, Trump would need to win 35 electoral votes from the toss ups to get to 270, and Biden would need 44.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nHere are three paths to get over the top for each candidate.\n\nFor Trump:\n\nThe Blue Wall Crumble: Trump toppled the Blue Wall in 2016, winning Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. If he did so again, the 44 electoral votes there would be more than enough. Any other states would be icing. But importantly: Trump likely needs to win at least one of these states to win election again, because the Sun Belt states of Nevada, Arizona and Georgia only provide 33 Electoral Votes. Sun Belt Plus: Trump could sweep the Sun Belt, but would come up short if he were to lose all the Blue Wall states. That would mean a whisker-close, 270-268 loss for Trump. So he would need at least one other state \u2014 likely one of the toss-up Blue Wall states, or he could aim to pick off New Hampshire or Minnesota... or win the one electoral vote in Nebraska's 2nd Congressional District, which would lead to a tie race (see below). The Eastern Front: Pennsylvania and Georgia provide exactly the 35 Electoral Votes Trump would need to get over the finish line and would put him at 270, even if Biden wins Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona and Nevada.\n\nFor Biden:\n\nThe Repeat: Remember, Biden already won once and with 51% of the vote, so he just has to convince the people who voted for him once to do so again. Biden won in 2020 with 306 electoral votes, meaning he can lose up to 36 and still win. Four years ago, Biden swept all of the states in the toss up column. Hold the Wall: If Biden hangs onto Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, he'd have a 270-268 win. Of those, the state he most needs to make up some ground is in Michigan, though most polls are currently within the margin of error. That's why Biden is campaigning so hard talking about steel and increasing tariffs on Chinese imports to appeal to the kinds of union and working-class voters \u2013 that were so key in 2020 \u2013 in those states. The Southwest Chip Shot: Latino voters are critical to Biden's efforts to win in Nevada and Arizona. He's lagging with them currently, but is running lots of Spanish-language ads in both places to try and boost his appeal. Plus, the Arizona abortion ruling threatens to make abortion a focus and be a turnout motivator in the state. If Biden were to win both, and Trump were to chip off Michigan (or Wisconsin), but Biden holds Pennsylvania, Biden would win 272-268. (By the way, if Biden were to win Nevada, Arizona, Wisconsin and Michigan, he'd still lose if he lost Pennsylvania, 270-268.)\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBut, there could also be a tie:\n\nThere has only been one Electoral Vote tie in U.S. history \u2014 it happened in the election of 1800.\n\nThe country came thisclose in 1876, and 2000 was within 5 electoral votes... and some hanging chads.\n\nIf a tie happened, Trump would likely become president, because a tie would go to the House. Each House delegation would cast one collective vote for their states. The voting delegations would be those voted into the House after this year's congressional elections.\n\nRepublicans currently hold an advantage and are still likely to do so in 2025 as well.\n\nHere are two potential, not outside the realm of possibility, tie scenarios:\n\nLoading...\n\nSun Belt + Omaha: Trump sweeps the Sun Belt, wins the one electoral vote in the Omaha area congressional district in Nebraska, as he did in 2016, but Biden wins the Blue Wall states. Industrial tie: Biden sweeps the Sun Belt toss ups, but loses Michigan and Pennsylvania in the Blue Wall. (NOTE: In this scenario, Georgia and North Carolina could be swapped out because they both have the same number of Electoral Votes.)",

        "text": "Abortion could dominate the 2024 election in Florida. Will that help Democrats flip the state?\nRepublicans, who have been on a winning streak, insist otherwise.\n\nAbortion could dominate the 2024 election in Florida. Will that help Democrats flip the state?\n\nFor decades, with only a few exceptions, Florida has been one of the most closely fought states in presidential elections -- famously helping George W. Bush beat Al Gore in 2000 by just 537 votes.\n\nSome of the state's other big races were often just as close. But Florida appeared to be shifting rapidly to the right since 2020, with Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, cruising to reelection by nearly 20 points.\n\nNow, however, as voters gear up for the next presidential election, state Democrats hope to put Florida back in play with the help of abortion access -- which will be put directly before voters on the same November ballot with President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump,\n\n\"Our agenda, our coalition, and the unique dynamics this election presents make it clear: President Biden is in a stronger position to win Florida this cycle than he was in 2020,\" Biden's campaign manager, Julie Chavez Rodriguez, wrote in a memo in early April, underscoring the cautious optimism among some in her party.\n\nRodriguez and other Biden aides have made this pitch: Floridians have rejected \"MAGA politics\" since the 2022 midterms and Biden is in a good position to \"assemble a winning coalition\" of key voter groups in the state: seniors, Hispanic voters, Black voters and voters who previously supported GOP candidate Nikki Haley over Trump in the 2024 primary.\n\nBeyond abortion, Rodriguez singled out issues like the cost of living, health care access and welfare programs like Social Security.\n\n\"Make no mistake: Florida is not an easy state to win,\" she wrote in her memo, in part, \"but it is a winnable one.\"\n\nRecent history, including DeSantis' big win in 2022 and Trump's back-to-back victories in 2016 and 2020, undercuts that, observers say. DeSantis also signed the state's 15-week and six-week abortion bans and was embraced by voters.\n\nBut those races were all held either before or just after the U.S. Supreme Court's conservative-leaning majority overruled Roe v. Wade. Since then, 21 states have banned or severely restricted access to abortion -- including Florida, where the six-week restriction, with some exceptions, is set to take effect at the end of this month.\n\nIn the two years after Roe was reversed, a number of red and blue states have also put abortion-related ballot initiatives before voters. Abortion access has won in each case, from California to Kentucky, Kansas to Maine, Ohio to Vermont.\n\nFlorida voters are set to cast votes in November on their own abortion ballot question, which would amend the state's constitution and guarantee broader access to the procedure.\n\nNational and state Democrats welcomed the news early this month that the Florida Supreme Court would allow the abortion ballot initiative to appear on the state's ballot this year, with many arguing, including Biden's campaign, that that will boost voter turnout and enthusiasm for pro-abortion rights candidates and favor Democrats, as it has elsewhere.\n\nPresident Joe Biden speaks, April 22, 2022, in Seattle. Andrew Harnik/AP\n\nBiden will travel to Tampa, Florida on Tuesday to give a speech on reproductive rights exactly one week before the state's six-week abortion ban kicks in.\n\nBut Florida Democrats are also aware of the uphill battle ahead of them in November. Of the nearly 13.5 million people registered to vote in the state, 5.2 million are registered as Republicans, while 4.3 million are registered as Democrats, a difference of about 900,000 voters, according to state data.\n\nAfter decades of Democrats holding an official edge with voter registration in the state, that flipped starting in 2021.\n\nThere are also 3.5 million voters in the state who are not registered with either major party.\n\nEvan Power, the chair of the Florida GOP, contended that abortion isn't the issue to tip the state in the opposing party's favor.\n\n\"Democrats made [abortion] the No. 1 issue that they ran in on in Florida in 2022 and we won by 19% of the votes,\" Power told ABC News.\n\nReferring to the six-week ban, he said, \"This is what the voters sent their legislators to Tallahassee to deliver on and they did deliver on it. So I don't think there's a backlash coming in at all.\"\n\nFlorida Democrats still insist that the state is \"winnable\" this election cycle, telling ABC News that the abortion ballot initiative is energizing voters.\n\n\"We were already seeing momentum in Florida before this ruling and, look, I think that the reality is, as the Biden campaign says, Florida is winnable and that this puts us on the map for the rest of the nation,\" Florida Democratic Party spokesperson Andrew Feldman said.\n\nBoth the Biden campaign and state Democrats have cited some special and local elections since 2022 as evidence that Florida remains competitive, like in decades past.\n\nLast May, Democrats flipped Jacksonville's mayoral office for the first time in 30 years when former TV news anchor Donna Deegan, who was endorsed by abortion advocates, defeated Daniel Davis, the CEO of the JAX Chamber pro-business group.\n\nAbortion rights activists participate in the \"Rally for Our Freedom\" to protect abortion rights for Floridians, in Orlando, Florida, on April 13, 2024.

He defeated former Florida Gov. Charlie Crist by double digits two years ago, a few months after the Roe ruling.\n\nHowever, some others call the 2022 midterms in Florida an \"outlier\" when anticipating how close the state could be in the 2024 general election.\n\nJustin Sayfie, a government relations consultant at Ballard Partners and former spokesperson for former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, a Republican, said that he believes DeSantis' resounding victory in 2022 came from those who supported his COVID-19 policies in keeping the state open during the pandemic.\n\nWith the virus now largely faded from public view, Sayfie said that won't be a significant factor in how people vote this year -- and so the proposed abortion amendment on Florida's ballot will grab more attention and make the presidential election more competitive than it would have otherwise.\n\nHe cited the last four elections: two in which Barack Obama won; two in which Trump won.\n\n\"Donald Trump's victory in 2020 was only by 3 points, so I think Florida is a competitive state,\" Sayfie said. \"And having reproductive rights on the ballot ... is a net plus for Democrats.\"\n\nFlorida GOP Vice Chair Evan Power speaks to reporters, Dec. 17, 2023. Zac Anderson/USAToday Network\n\nFeldman, with the state Democrats, argued that the 2022 midterm elections were also an anomaly and that Florida's Democratic Party was less organized than it is now.\n\n\"We're the first people to say it; we were not in the game,\" Feldman said. \"We did not have an operation that did what Democrats do best in terms of turning out voters, in terms of coordinating, and we are getting back to a time now in Florida where we were in [during the] Obama years.\"\n\nIn an interview, 538 senior elections analyst and senior editor Nathaniel Rakich said Florida is in the range of winnability for Democrats but that the state is \"slightly Republican-leaning.\"\n\nWith Biden doing well in fundraising for his reelection campaign, Rakich said it's not crazy for the president to put in effort in Florida, noting Biden's relatively small margin of defeat in the state in 2020 and that what partly contributed to the so-called red wave there in 2022 was low Democratic turnout.\n\n\"I think people just have poor political memories and then look at 2022 and 2020 in Florida and they say oh that the state is gone,\" Rakich said. \"But sometimes, you know, states kind of go off on little tangents in their political journey -- but then they kind of come back to the main road.\"\n\nEditor's note: This story has been updated.\n\nABC News' Gabriella Abdul-Hakim and Mike Pappano contributed to this report.",

        "text": "Apart From Trump, Biden, These 4 Candidates Are In US Presidential Race\nPresident Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump will face each other in the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 5 in what looks set to be a divisive, closely fought contest. Several third-party hopefuls are also running.\n\nHere is a list of the candidates:\n\nDONALD TRUMP\n\nTrump, in office from 2017-2021, has secured enough delegates to clinch the Republican nomination, setting up the first presidential rematch in nearly 70 years.\n\nHe has leveraged his unprecedented legal challenges to solidify support among his base and has cast his third bid for the White House in part as retribution against perceived political enemies.\n\nHe calls supporters jailed for the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol \"hostages\" and campaigns using increasingly dystopian rhetoric.\n\nTrump, 77, faces 88 charges in four criminal cases over efforts to subvert the 2020 election as well as unlawfully keeping classified national security documents and falsifying business records. His first criminal trial began in New York on April 15.\n\nHe has called the criminal charges a Democratic conspiracy designed to keep him from winning, with some of his legal challenges reaching the U.S. Supreme Court. The U.S. Justice Department denies any political interference.\n\nIf elected to another four-year term, Trump has vowed revenge on his political enemies, and said he would not be a dictator except \"on day one.\" He also wants the power to replace federal civil service workers with loyalists.\n\nHe sparked criticism from Western leaders for saying the U.S. would not defend NATO members that failed to spend enough on defense and would encourage Russia to attack them. He also pressed congressional Republicans to stall military aid for Ukraine.\n\nTrump has made immigration his top domestic campaign issue, declaring he would carry out mass deportations, create holding camps, utilize the National Guard, end birthright citizenship, and expand a travel ban on people from certain countries. He has referred to migrants as \"animals.\"\n\nOn abortion, Trump takes credit for the U.S. Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade and in April said abortion should remain a state issue. He has criticized some Republican-led states' six-week abortion bans and has declined to support a federal ban.\n\nHe has promised sweeping changes that included eliminating Obamacare health insurance before saying in an April 11 video that he would not \"terminate\" it. He has also vowed to undo much of the Biden administration's work to fight climate change.\n\nTrump has yet to announce a vice presidential running mate, but several possibilities have been floated. Mike Pence, who ran alongside Trump in 2016 and 2020 but was targeted by Trump and his supporters amid the Jan. 6 attack, refused to endorse him in November's contest.\n\nDEMOCRATIC PARTY\n\nJOE BIDEN\n\nBiden launched his 2020 candidacy as an urgent bid to defend American liberties and protect democracy and has cast his reelection bid in the same light, saying Trump threatens the future of American democracy.\n\nBiden faced no serious challenger for the party's nomination, which he clinched in March.\n\nNovember's election will be much tougher, with the most recent Reuters/Ipsos poll putting Biden's voter support slightly ahead at 41% of registered voters, 4 percentage points ahead of Trump's 37%.\n\nBiden, already the oldest U.S. president ever at 81, must convince voters he is more fit for office than Trump, who is just four years younger, while also combating low approval ratings.\n\nThe economy will also factor in his reelection campaign. While the U.S. escaped an anticipated recession and is growing faster than economists expected, inflation and the cost of essentials is weighing on voters.\n\nBiden pushed through massive economic stimulus and infrastructure spending packages to boost U.S. industrial output, but has received little recognition from voters so far as his campaign moves to highlight new semiconductor manufacturing plants, housing plans, and other economic efforts.\n\nBiden's handling of immigration policy has also been criticized by Republicans and Democrats as migrant crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border hit record highs.\n\nHe has led the response of Western governments to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, persuading allies to punish Russia and support Kyiv.\n\nBiden has provided military aid to Israel in its conflict with Hamas in Gaza while pushing for more humanitarian assistance, but he has faced sharp criticism from some Democrats for not pushing harder for a ceasefire or matching his tougher rhetoric on Israel with action.\n\nHe has threatened to condition the aid on Israeli steps to protect aid workers and civilians.\n\nMARIANNE WILLIAMSON\n\nBest-selling author and self-help guru Marianne Williamson, 71, relaunched her long-shot 2024 presidential bid focusing on \"justice and love\" less than one month after dropping out.\n\nIn a February statement, she said she was getting back in to fight Trump's \"dark and authoritarian vision\" after earlier suspending it because she was losing \"the horse race.\" Williamson previously ran as a Democrat in the 2020 presidential primary but dropped out of that race before any votes were cast.\n\nINDEPENDENTS\n\nROBERT F. KENNEDY JR\n\nAn anti-vaccine activist and environmental advocate, Kennedy, 70, is running as an independent after initially challenging Biden for the Democratic nomination.\n\nWhile he lags in overall polling, Kennedy could siphon votes from Trump and Biden, with a March Reuters/Ipsos poll showing he was backed by 16% of registered voters.\n\nKennedy is the son of U.S. Senator Robert F. Kennedy, who was assassinated in 1968 during his own presidential bid, but he has drawn rebukes from his famous family, which also reportedly plans to step up efforts to publicly back Biden.\n\nKennedy, who chose wealthy lawyer Nicole Shanahan as his running mate, supports Israel and has questioned a six-week ceasefire backed by Biden.\n\nHe said he views the U.S. southern border situation as a humanitarian crisis and opposes Trump's border wall. He has also vowed to repeal parts of Biden's climate bill over tax breaks he says help the oil industry.\n\nOn health, Kennedy has taken different positions on abortion. He has been criticized for making false medical claims over the years on vaccines but says he would still allow Americans to have access to them.\n\nCORNEL WEST\n\nThe political activist, philosopher and academic is running as a third-party bid for president that is likely to appeal to progressive, Democratic-leaning voters.\n\nWest, 70, initially ran as a Green Party candidate, but in October he said people \"want good policies over partisan politics\" and announced his bid as an independent. He has promised to end poverty and guarantee housing.\n\nJILL STEIN\n\nJill Stein, a physician who ran under the Green Party in 2016, launched her current campaign accusing Democrats of betraying their promises \"for working people, youth and the climate again and again - while Republicans don't even make such promises in the first place.\"\n\nStein, 73, raised millions of dollars for recounts after Trump's surprise 2016 victory. Her allegations yielded only one electoral review in Wisconsin, which showed Trump had won.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "How US shale keeps sheltering America from the next oil price surge\nPrint this page\n\nYour guide to what the 2024 US election means for Washington and the world\n\nIn 1973 and 1979 war in Israel and turmoil in Iran twice ruptured the oil market, triggering an inflationary surge that sapped western economies and unseated a US president.\n\nIn the decades since, the possibility that new strife in the Middle East could deliver another administration-ending jump in oil and petrol prices has hung like a spectre over the White House.\n\nLast week, the fears suddenly looked overblown.\n\nOn Monday, less than a week after the first-ever direct military strikes by Iran on Israel brought fears of a wider regional war, oil prices settled at $87 per barrel \u2014 flat versus their level just before a strike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus precipitated the eruption.\n\nIt was a notable non-reaction from oil markets, especially given the threat Iran poses to the Strait of Hormuz, the sea lane through which passes one in every five barrels of petroleum consumed globally each day. Demonstrating its menace to the waterway, Iran seized a vessel there on April 13, the same day it launched its attack on Israel.\n\nThe crude price calm in the face of this turmoil owes much to events 7,000 miles away in the shale fields of North Dakota and west Texas, where drillers have left global markets awash with American oil.\n\n\u201cShale has redrawn the map of world oil in a way most people don\u2019t seem to understand,\u201d said Daniel Yergin, vice-chair of S&P Global and a Pulitzer Prize-winning energy historian. \u201cIt has changed not only the supply-demand balance but it has changed the geopolitical balance and the psychological balance.\u201d\n\nThe numbers are stark. Two decades ago the US produced about 7mn barrels a day of petroleum and consumed 21mn. Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia and Kuwait \u2014 which send oil through the Strait of Hormuz \u2014 were among the US\u2019s most important foreign suppliers.\n\nNow the US produces almost 20mn b/d of petroleum, roughly on par with consumption. Imports from the Gulf have plummeted, and the US became a net oil exporter for the first time in 2019. The prolific Permian Basin shale of Texas and New Mexico pumps more oil than Kuwait, Iraq or the UAE, three of Opec\u2019s powerhouses.\n\nThe strategic advantages are profound, say analysts, even for a White House eager to transition away from fossil fuels to clean energy.\n\nThe shale surge has blunted the impact of supply cuts made by Opec in the past two years, they say, and allowed President Joe Biden\u2019s administration\u2019s to impose sanctions on suppliers such as Venezuela and Russia, while tightening restrictions on Iran \u2014 all without fear of driving up oil prices.\n\n\u201cIt is a huge turnaround from where we were at in the 1970s,\u201d said Harold Hamm, chair of Continental Resources and a shale pioneer. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t have the shale revolution now you would have $150 oil . . . You would be in a very volatile situation. It would be horrendous.\u201d\n\nRising shale supplies also helped keep the lights on in Europe following Moscow\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, with shipments of US liquefied natural gas \u2014 previously labelled \u201cmolecules of US freedom\u201d by the Trump administration \u2014 helping to wean the continent off Russian piped supplies.\n\nThe extent of shale\u2019s significance to oil markets was already visible in 2019, Yergin said, after a devastating drone attack on the Abqaiq crude processing facility in Saudi Arabia, the nerve centre of its oil sector. Crude prices rose sharply \u2014 and then fell back almost as quickly.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s when it became clear to me that there had been a great rebalancing,\u201d Yergin said.\n\nEven so, experts warn that the US still remains vulnerable to oil shocks. All- out war between Israel and Iran, or a big new plunge in exports \u2014 for example if the Strait of Hormuz were to be shut \u2014 would inevitably remove supplies from a fungible global market, raising petrol prices from Beijing to Boston.\n\n\u201cWe are still acutely exposed to geopolitics and market manipulation. And shale doesn\u2019t really help with that,\u201d said Jim Krane at Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute. \u201cYes, we\u2019re a big producer. But more importantly, we\u2019re a big consumer, and that\u2019s where our exposure lies.\u201d\n\nThe US accounts for about 20 per cent of global demand, driven by the country\u2019s reliance on big, gas-guzzling vehicles.\n\nShale also remains uniquely vulnerable to price gyrations, making it an unreliable component of the global oil market, say some analysts.\n\nIt was only four years ago that crashing oil prices during the Covid-19 pandemic pushed many shale producers to the brink of bankruptcy. Then- President Donald Trump was forced to plead with Saudi Arabia and Russia to slash their own output to prop up prices to spare the shale patch \u2014 a demonstration of US energy vulnerability.\n\nAfter Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine triggered an oil price increase in 2022, it was Biden\u2019s turn to press the Saudis for help, this time urging them to pump more to beat back soaring US petrol costs.\n\nShale executives are themselves sceptical that drillers could raise supply quickly enough to rescue the global economy from a sudden oil shock. Wall Street remains reluctant to fund new drilling campaigns by producers that earned a reputation for profligacy in recent years.\n\nThe Biden administration has been conscious of that dynamic \u2014 and also of the political consequences of higher gasoline prices ahead of elections. Last year, one senior Biden adviser said Wall Street was being \u201cun-American\u201d in holding back drillers.\n\nThe White House\u2019s diplomatic focus has been to prevent further turmoil in the Middle East.\n\n\u201cWe have an election and the Biden administration cannot, cannot, cannot afford to act recklessly or precipitously in the region. They\u2019re being extraordinarily careful with every step they take,\u201d said Matt Gertken, a geopolitical strategist at BCA Research.\n\nThe administration has also said it remains willing to use stored strategic reserves of oil to keep prices at bay. At about $3.68 per gallon, US petrol prices may be lower than in other economies \u2014 but they are up 15 per cent this year.\n\n\u201cBottom line is that it is always better as a nation to have your own oil,\u201d said Amy Myers Jaffe, a professor at NYU.\n\n\u201cBut alas, [crude] prices will go up if there is a market supply shock and that will probably transmit itself back to US drivers as higher fuel prices \u2014 global market and all that.\u201d",

        "text": "The war in Ukraine could reach a decision point by the NATO Summit. Policymakers need to prepare now.\nRussia has launched its third major mobilization wave in anticipation of its upcoming spring/summer campaign to take more land in Ukraine. On March 31, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree to begin the next conscription drive, setting the target at 150,000 new inductees slated for military service. This came after a decision in July of last year by the Russian Duma to raise the maximum age of conscription from twenty-seven to thirty, significantly increasing the pool of available recruits. Ukrainian estimates put the number of new soldiers that could be inducted in the third Russian mobilization drive at as many as three hundred thousand by June.\n\nThere are various assessments about the extent to which the Russian land forces have been reconstituted since Russia\u2019s initial losses, with some analysts arguing that the process is nearly complete. But regardless of these various assessments, the gap between Russia\u2019s and Ukraine\u2019s military capabilities\u2014and the difference in sheer mass\u2014continues to grow apace, even though Kyiv recently lowered the draft age for Ukrainian males from twenty-seven to twenty-five. Recent frontline gains by Russia, along with US aid to Ukraine moving forward in Congress only after months of delays, suggest that a major decision point in the war may be approaching in the coming months. While the US House of Representatives at last agreed on Saturday to send $60.8 billion in aid to Ukraine, which means the United States could soon be sending desperately needed ammunition and air defenses to the front lines, a Russian push already appears to be in its early stages. And it could well create a crisis for the NATO alliance much bigger than the current grumbling over who is spending more on Ukraine\u2019s behalf.\n\nConsidering that Russian infantry may receive as little as a few months\u2019 training before they are thrown into battle\u2014and the fact that Moscow continues to build new training facilities\u2014it is likely that the new offensive will coincide or overlap with the upcoming seventy-fifth anniversary NATO summit in Washington on July 9-11. In line with official Russian propaganda that this war is being fought not just against Ukraine but against NATO, and that it is a civilizational struggle against the \u201ccollective West,\u201d Putin could seize the opportunity to launch a major offensive during the Washington summit, with the intention of humiliating the Alliance precisely as it celebrates three-quarters of a century of containing Moscow\u2019s imperial ambitions. In such a scenario, the US presidential election could become a defining variable in how the war ends. (Increasingly extreme scenarios of how the war may end following the US presidential election have already emerged in the European press.)\n\nSimply put, if Putin launches a major push during the summit, would the Biden administration be able to maintain its \u201cas long as it takes\u201d strategy of sustaining Ukraine while minimizing the risk of nuclear escalation? Or would a Russian breakthrough in Ukraine be seen by the president\u2019s reelection team as an untenable liability just months before the vote, especially given that his likely Republican opponent would be certain to make the failure of US policy in Ukraine an issue in the campaign?\n\nA shared vision of victory in Ukraine\n\nThe monthslong delay of approving additional US aid to Ukraine, and the fact that Kyiv got serious about building up its defenses only six months ago, increase the country\u2019s vulnerabilities and the prospect that the latest Russian offensive may achieve a breakthrough, or at the very least widen the front. However, the biggest problem remains the Biden administration\u2019s overall approach of providing just enough aid to Kyiv so that Ukraine can hold the line, while draining Russian warfighting capabilities and limiting the risk of nuclear escalation. This position taken by the Biden administration has, for example, allowed Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany, the largest power in Europe, to sustain his \u201cRussia must not win, Ukraine must not lose\u201d strategic ambiguity, which stays the course toward eventual negotiations with Moscow to end the conflict.\n\nGiven the perceived stalemate on land, and despite clear Ukrainian gains at sea, some analysts today are indeed coming to the view that the war in Ukraine is heading for a negotiated settlement. In such a hypothetical settlement, Ukraine would preserve its sovereignty and independence while Russia keeps its territorial gains in the east, plus Crimea. Setting aside the fact that such an outcome would be tantamount to a Russian victory, these predictions could be undone by developments on the ground, much as the prevailing view in early 2022 that Ukraine would fall fast and resort to guerrilla operations was invalidated by Kyiv\u2019s staunch resolve to stand its ground and fight. So, rather than incessantly speculating about this or that territorial settlement or this or that negotiated deal, what Ukraine and the transatlantic community need most urgently is a shared vision of victory in Ukraine, one that Kyiv and its supporters can rally around. Next, the United States and its allies and partners need a strategy\u2014with resources to match\u2014that will allow Ukraine to achieve that victory. After all, to rephrase a clich\u00e9, visions without resources are merely hallucinations.\n\nIn the coming months, the Biden administration could change course on Ukraine. If the Russians advance in Ukraine, the administration would have two choices: stay the course and increase the risk of Ukrainian losses, or shift from a \u201cfor as long as it takes\u201d policy to an approach of \u201cwhatever the Ukrainians need to beat the Russians back.\u201d This would potentially increase the risk of escalation with Russia, but it would also deflect the electoral risk of being blamed for the failure of US policy in Ukraine, while giving Kyiv a fighting chance to reach a favorable position from which to negotiate.\n\nIf Ukraine is to have a shot at reversing the tide on the battlefield, it will need to receive a large quantity of long-range artillery to strike at rail links, fuel depots, ammunition depots, command posts, and airfields deep inside Russian territory. Absent those weapons and authorities, another Ukrainian frontal assault on the Russian defensive line is likely to lead to widespread casualties for the Ukrainian army once again.\n\nAt the strategic level, the Biden administration and US allies across Europe need a serious public conversation about a vision of victory that goes beyond the assertions that Russia cannot win in Ukraine and that the West\u2019s enduring commitment to Ukraine remains unshakeable. The transatlantic community needs a forthright discussion of the end state it wants, in clearly defined geostrategic terms rather than open-ended general support, followed by a commitment of resources to achieve those goals.\n\nThis summer will likely bring a decision point when it comes to US Ukraine policy. Depending on what happens in the next several months, the conflict may move into uncharted territory.\n\nAndrew A. Michta is senior fellow and director of the Scowcroft Strategy Initiative at the Atlantic Council.

(Scott Olson and Megan Varner, both via Getty Images)\n\nHow we did this Pew Research Center conducted this study to understand voters\u2019 views on the 2024 presidential election, as well how the public views President Joe Biden. For this analysis, we surveyed 8,709 adults \u2013 including 7,166 registered voters \u2013 from April 8 to April 14, 2024. Everyone who took part in this survey is a member of the Center\u2019s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. This way nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. Read more about the ATP\u2019s methodology. Here are the questions used for this report, along with responses, and the survey methodology.\n\nAs the 2024 presidential race heats up, American voters face a similar set of choices as they did four years ago \u2013 and many are not happy about it.\n\nWith the election still more than six months away, a new Pew Research Center survey finds that the presidential race is virtually tied: 49% of registered voters favor Donald Trump or lean toward voting for him, while 48% support or lean toward Joe Biden.\n\nA defining characteristic of the contest is that voters overall have little confidence in either candidate across a range of key traits, including fitness for office, personal ethics and respect for democratic values.\n\nWhere Trump has the advantage: More than a third of voters say they are extremely or very confident that Trump has the physical fitness (36%) and mental fitness (38%) needed to do the job of president.\n\nFar fewer say the same of Biden (15% are at least very confident in his physical fitness; 21% are extremely or very confident in his mental fitness). Majorities say they are not too or not at all confident in Biden\u2019s physical and mental fitness.\n\nWhere Biden has the advantage: More voters are extremely or very confident in Biden (34%) than in Trump (26%) to act ethically in office. And while 38% say they are at least very confident in Biden to respect the country\u2019s democratic values, fewer (34%) express that level of confidence in Trump. The survey was conducted before the start of Trump\u2019s \u201chush money\u201d trial in New York City.\n\n(Read more about voters\u2019 views of Biden and Trump in Chapter 2.)\n\nThe state of the 2024 presidential race\n\nThe new Center survey of 8,709 adults \u2013 including 7,166 registered voters \u2013 conducted April 8-14, 2024, finds large divides in voters\u2019 candidate preference by age, education, and race and ethnicity. As was the case in 2020, younger voters and those with a four-year college degree are more likely to favor Biden than Trump.\n\nOlder voters and those with no college degree favor Trump by large margins.\n\nAmong racial and ethnic groups:\n\nWhite voters favor Trump (56%) over Biden (42%) by a wide margin.\n\nfavor Trump (56%) over Biden (42%) by a wide margin. Roughly three-quarters of Black voters (77%) support Biden, while 18% back Trump.\n\n(77%) support Biden, while 18% back Trump. Hispanic voters are more evenly divided \u2013 52% favor Biden, while 44% back Trump.\n\nare more evenly divided \u2013 52% favor Biden, while 44% back Trump. Asian voters favor Biden (59%) over Trump (36%).\n\n(Read more about voters\u2019 candidate preferences in Chapter 1.)\n\nMost voters who turned out in 2020 favor the same candidate in 2024. Among validated 2020 voters, overwhelming majorities of those who cast ballots for Biden (91%) and Trump (94%) support the same candidate this year. Registered voters who did not vote in 2020 are about evenly divided: 48% back Trump, while 46% support Biden.\n\nA majority of voters say \u201cit really matters who wins\u201d the 2024 race. Today, 69% of voters say it really matters which candidate wins the presidential contest this November. This is somewhat smaller than the share who said this in April 2020 about that year\u2019s election (74%). Nearly identical shares of Biden\u2019s and Trump\u2019s supporters say the outcome of the presidential race really matters.\n\nAbout half of voters would replace both Biden and Trump on the 2024 ballot\n\nReflecting their dissatisfaction with the Biden-Trump matchup, nearly half of registered voters (49%) say that, if they had the ability to decide the major party candidates for the 2024 election, they would replace both Biden and Trump on the ballot.\n\nBiden\u2019s supporters are especially likely to say they would replace both candidates if they had the chance. Roughly six-in-ten (62%) express this view, compared with 35% of Trump supporters.\n\nThere also are stark age differences in these views: 66% of voters under 30 say they would replace both candidates if they had the chance, compared with 54% of those ages 30 to 49 and fewer than half (43%) of those 50 and older.\n\n(Read more about voters\u2019 feelings toward the upcoming election in Chapter 3.)\n\nEvaluations of the Biden and Trump presidencies\n\n42% of voters overall say Trump was a good or great president, while 11% say he was average. This is a modest improvement since March 2021, two months after he left office.\n\n28% of voters say Biden is a good or great president, while 21% say he is average. These views are mostly on par with June 2020 assessments of the kind of president Biden would be \u2013 but today, a smaller share of voters say he is average.\n\n(Read more about ratings of Biden\u2019s and Trump\u2019s presidencies in Chapter 1.)\n\nOther findings: Biden\u2019s job approval ticks up, Trump\u2019s election-related criminal charges\n\nBiden\u2019s approval among the general public: Today, Biden\u2019s approval rating sits at 35% \u2013 roughly on par with his rating in January (33%). His job rating has climbed slightly among Democrats over that period, however. Today, 65% of Democrats approve of him \u2013 up 4 percentage points since January. (Read more about Biden\u2019s approval rating in Chapter 4.)\n\nToday, Biden\u2019s approval rating sits at 35% \u2013 roughly on par with his rating in January (33%). His job rating has climbed slightly among Democrats over that period, however. Today, 65% of Democrats approve of him \u2013 up 4 percentage points since January. (Read more about Biden\u2019s approval rating in Chapter 4.) Conceding the presidential election: A majority of voters say it is important that the losing candidate in November publicly acknowledge the winner as the legitimate president. But Trump\u2019s supporters are far less likely than Biden\u2019s to say it is very important (44% vs. 77%). (Read more about voters\u2019 views on election concession in Chapter 3.)\n\nTrump\u2019s criminal charges related to the 2020 election\n\nAs Trump faces charges that he sought to overturn the outcome of the 2020 election, 45% of Americans say they think Trump\u2019s actions broke the law. This compares with 38% who say his actions did not break the law \u2013 including 15% who say his actions were wrong but not illegal, and 23% who say he did nothing wrong. Nearly two-in-ten are not sure.\n\nDemocrats mostly say Trump broke the law; Republicans are more divided. An overwhelming majority of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (78%) say Trump\u2019s actions in seeking to change the outcome of the 2020 election broke the law.\n\nAmong Republicans and Republican leaners:",

Feelings about the 2024 race for president\nAbout half of voters (49%) say they have given a lot of thought to the candidates who are running in the 2024 presidential election \u2013 nearly identical to the share saying this at a similar point four years ago (51%).\n\nBut the share who say \u201cit really matters who wins\u201d in November is 5 percentage points lower than it was in April 2020.\n\nAnd most voters say that if it were up to them, they would replace at least one of the two likely nominees (Joe Biden and Donald Trump). About half say they\u2019d replace both Biden and Trump on the ballot.\n\nToday, Trump and Biden supporters are about equally likely to say they\u2019ve given a lot of thought to the presidential candidates. About half of Trump\u2019s and Biden\u2019s supporters say they have given a lot of thought to their options.\n\nIn April 2020, about half of voters said they had given \u201ca lot\u201d of thought to the candidates. But Biden\u2019s supporters \u2013 fresh off the heels of a competitive primary \u2013 were more likely than Trump\u2019s supporters to say they had thought a lot about the candidates (58% vs. 48%).\n\nDoes it matter who wins?\n\nToday, 69% of voters say \u201cit really matters who wins\u201d the presidential election. Just 8% say it doesn\u2019t really matter who wins, and roughly a third fall somewhere in between.\n\n\n\nHowever, the share of voters who say it really matters is 5 points lower than it was in April 2020, when 74% of voters said it really mattered. Both Trump and Biden supporters are lower on this measure today than four years ago.\n\nWhat if voters could change the presidential ballot?\n\nThough both Biden and Trump have received enough delegates in the 2024 presidential primaries to secure their respective party\u2019s nominations for president, most voters say they would like to replace at least one of them on the ballot.\n\n49% of voters say that, if they had the ability to decide the major party candidates for the 2024 presidential election, they would replace both Trump and Biden with different candidates.\n\n16% say they would keep Biden but replace Trump with a different Republican.\n\nA similar share (18%) say they would keep Trump but replace Biden with a different Democrat.\n\nAnother 15% of voters say they would keep the contest as is.\n\nDemographic and political differences\n\nThere are demographic differences in desired changes to the ballot. To some extent, these are associated with voting preferences.\n\nBiden supporters are much more likely than Trump supporters to say they\u2019d replace both candidates if they could (62% of Biden\u2019s supporters say this, compared with 35% of Trump\u2019s). In contrast, Trump\u2019s voters are much more likely than Biden\u2019s to say they\u2019d keep both(27% of Trump supporters vs. 4% of Biden supporters). Roughly similar shares (about a third each) of each candidate\u2019s supporters say they would keep only their candidate and replace the other.\n\nAge\n\nYounger voters are more likely than older voters to desire ballot changes. Roughly two-thirds of voters under 30 say they would replace both Biden and Trump on the 2024 ballot. This compares with a narrower majority of those ages 30 to 49 (54%) and smaller shares of those 50 to 64 (46%) and those 65 and older (40%).\n\nThe gap between younger and older voters is far wider among Biden\u2019s backers:\n\nNearly three-quarters of Biden supporters under 50 (73%) say they would replace both candidates. Among Biden supporters ages 50 and older, about half say they would replace both Biden and Trump (53%). In both age groups, most of those who do not want to replace both candidates say they would keep only Biden.\n\nAmong Trump supporters, 38% of those under 50 would replace both, compared with 33% of those 50 and older. Older Trump supporters are roughly twice as likely as younger Trump supporters to say they\u2019d keep both candidates on the ballot (32% vs. 18%). Older Trump backers are more likely than younger ones to say they\u2019d keep Trump but replace Biden (41% vs. 33%).\n\nEducation\n\nAmong each candidate\u2019s supporters, those with a four-year college degree are more likely than those with less education to say they would replace both candidates if they could.\n\nMost voters continue to say it is at least somewhat important for the losing candidate to publicly acknowledge the winner as the legitimate president of the country.\n\nOver the past eight years, a majority of voters \u2013 regardless of who they supported for president \u2013 have said it was at least somewhat important that the losing candidate in a presidential race acknowledge the winner.\n\nBut the degree to which Trump\u2019s supporters have said this is important has shifted over the past eight years.\n\n\n\nAs the 2016 presidential election neared, Trump\u2019s supporters became less likely to say it was important for the losing candidate to concede than they were earlier in the fall: The share who said it was very important for the loser to acknowledge the winner as the legitimate president declined by 20 percentage points between October 2016 and the eve of the November 2016 election.\n\nIn the spring of 2020, as Trump ran for reelection, 66% said this was very important.\n\nToday, 44% of Trump\u2019s supporters say it is very important for the losing candidate to concede. This compares with 77% of Biden\u2019s supporters.\n\nWhile there have been shifts among Clinton and Biden supporters during the same period, these changes have been much more modest. Majorities have said it is very important for the losing candidate to acknowledge the winner.",

        "text": "Joe Biden vs Donald Trump: Key Issues In US Presidential Elections\nFour years after Democratic nominee Joe Biden defeated then-US President Donald Trump, the two political heavyweights are likely to lock horns again, come November. While neither party has officially declared their candidates, Mr Trump is presumably the nominee for the Republican Party, having faced no serious challenges in the primaries. Mr Biden, similarly, has come up as the clear frontrunner among Democrats during the state primaries. The election is set for November 5, with results expected soon after.\n\nUS Elections 2024: Key issues\n\nForeign policy\n\nA presidential candidate's foreign policy ideas form the bedrock of his/her campaign. With the conflict in Ukraine and Israel's war in Gaza, the US electorate is keeping a close watch on what Mr Biden and Mr Trump propose to improve the situation and reduce the burden on the country's taxpayers. The Biden administration has drawn the ire of many, including Vivek Ramaswamy and Robert F Kennedy Jr, who have criticised the president for getting involved in regime change operations and favouring the \u201cmilitary-industrial complex\u201d.\n\nMr Kennedy Jr referred to the Russia-Ukraine war as a \"proxy war\" and claimed the US's approach was \"terrible for the Ukrainian people.\"\n\nThe $95 billion national security package, which includes $60 billion for Ukraine, is also facing delays in the Republican-led House of Representatives, with GOP members demanding changes.\n\nIsrael's war in Gaza\n\nDespite over six months of continuous bombardment of Gaza where over 35,000 Palestinians, majorly women and kids, have been killed, both candidates are in support of Israel. Recent tensions between Iran, the arch enemy of the US, and Israel have also put President Biden in a spot. However, he's made it clear to Israel that the US won't take part in its retaliation against the Islamic Republic.\n\nMr Trump's approach, on the other hand, is to prioritise swift resolution, showing less consideration for Palestine, echoing his previous pro-Israel stance. He has also hit out at Mr Biden for his \"weakness\" in dealing with Iran, especially after the country's drone attack on Israel.\n\nEconomy\n\nThe US economy has bounced back stronger post the pandemic, according to President Biden. He sees this as a major success, citing low unemployment and steady growth with over 14 million new jobs. However, former President Trump disagrees, pointing to rising debt and inflation, leading to a cost of living crisis and discontent among voters.\n\nTaxes and business concerns are also some of the major issues. Mr Trump's 2017 tax plan cut rates for individuals and corporations, but Mr Biden plans to raise corporate taxes and top-income tax rates.\n\nHealthcare\n\nHealthcare remains a pressing issue for Americans, with the US having one of the world's most expensive healthcare systems. Recent polls indicate that healthcare is a top concern among basic expenses for Americans. Democrats, including President Biden, pledge to support and improve Obamacare, an insurance policy introduced by former President Obama to provide coverage for citizens.\n\nIn contrast, former President Trump sees Obamacare as a failed initiative and advocates for a complete overhaul of the system to ensure affordable healthcare for the US population.\n\nImmigration\n\nIllegal immigration has been an enormous concern to the US, with Mr Trump accusing Democrats and Mr Biden of encouraging it for political gain. He had initiated the construction of a border wall with Mexico during his term, but Mr Biden stopped funding the project after he was elected, leaving it unfinished.\n\nAccording to recent reports from the Pew Research Centre, the unauthorised immigrant population in the United States was around 10.5 million in 2021. Among them, Indians make up the third-largest group, with approximately 725,000 people currently living in the country illegally.\n\nCultural issues\n\nCultural issues, including race, gender, and abortion, continue to divide the US population. President Biden supports reproductive freedom and opposes the overturning of Roe vs Wade, a landmark ruling that established the right to abortion. This stance contrasts with former President Trump's support for abortion restrictions, except under certain circumstances.\n\nThe gender issue has also become a point of contention, with approximately 7% of Americans identifying as part of the LGBTQ community. Democrats advocate for freedom of choice and gender-neutral language, while Mr Trump and other Republicans, like Vivek Ramasamy, view it as a threat to traditional values and the Judeo-Christian way of life in American society.",

All local election officials in all U.S. states and territories accept the FPCA.You can complete the FPCA online at FVAP.gov. The online voting assistant will ask you questions specific to your state. We encourage you to request your blank ballots be delivered electronically (by email, internet download, or fax, depending on your state). Include your email address on your FPCA to take advantage of the electronic ballot delivery option. Return the FPCA per the instructions on the website. The online voting assistant will tell you if your state allows the FPCA to be returned electronically or if you must submit a paper copy with original ink signature. If you must return a paper version, please follow the same instructions below for returning your ballot.\n\nReceive and complete your ballot. States are required to send out ballots 45 days before a regular election for federal office and generally send ballots at least 30 days before primary elections.

        "summary": " New and existing technologies have increasingly been weaponized to aid and abet repressive political forces to spread disinformation, pit communities against each other and attack minorities . States including Argentina, Brazil, India and the UK have increasingly turned to facial recognition technologies to police public protests and sporting events and discriminate against marginalized communities \u2013 particularly migrants and refugees .",
        "text": "Flagrant rule-breaking by governments and corporate actors\nTech wielded to stoke hate, division and discrimination poses threat in landmark year of elections\n\nAmnesty International found that political actors in many parts of the world are ramping up their attacks on women, LGBTI people and marginalized communities who have historically been scapegoated for political or electoral gains. New and existing technologies have increasingly been weaponized to aid and abet these repressive political forces to spread disinformation, pit communities against each other and attack minorities.\n\nThe report also points to the expansive use of existing technologies to entrench discriminatory policies. States including Argentina, Brazil, India and the UK have increasingly turned to facial recognition technologies to police public protests and sporting events and discriminate against marginalized communities \u2013 particularly migrants and refugees. For example, in response to legal action by Amnesty International, the New York Police Department revealed in 2023 how it used the technology to subject Black Lives Matter protests in the city to surveillance.\n\nThe nefarious use of facial recognition was no more pervasive than in the West Bank of the Occupied Palestinian Territories where it was used by Israel to reinforce restrictions on freedom of movement and help maintain the system of apartheid.\n\nIn Serbia, the introduction of a semi-automated social welfare system resulted in thousands of people losing access to vital social assistance. This particularly affected Roma communities and people with disabilities, demonstrating how unchecked automation can exacerbate inequality.\n\nWith millions fleeing conflicts around the world, the report notes how abusive technologies were relied upon for migration governance and border enforcement, including through use of digital alternatives to detention, border externalization technologies, data software, biometrics and algorithmic decision-making systems. The proliferation of these technologies perpetuates and reinforces discrimination, racism, and disproportionate and unlawful surveillance against racialized people.\n\nMeanwhile, spyware has remained largely unregulated, despite the long-term evidence of the human rights violations it drives, with activists-in-exile, journalists and human rights defenders usually among those targeted. In 2023, Amnesty International uncovered the use of Pegasus spyware against journalists and civil society activists in countries including Armenia, the Dominican Republic, India and Serbia, while EU-based and regulated spyware was freely sold to states the world over.\n\nBig Tech\u2019s surveillance business model is pouring fuel on this fire of hate, enabling those with malintent to hound, dehumanize and amplify dangerous narratives to consolidate power or polling. Agn\u00e8s Callamard\n\nOver the past year the rapid trajectory of generative AI, has transformed the scale of the threat posed by the gamut of technologies already in existence \u2013 from spyware to state automation and social media\u2019s run-away algorithms.\n\nIn the face of rapacious advancements, regulation has largely remained stagnant. However, in a sign that European policymakers are beginning to act, a landmark EU-wide Digital Services Act came into force in February 2024. While imperfect and incomplete, it has nevertheless triggered a much-needed global debate on AI regulation.\n\n\u201cThere is a vast chasm between the risks posed by the unchecked advancement of technologies, and where we need to be in terms of regulation and protection. It\u2019s our future foretold and will only worsen unless the rampant proliferation of unregulated technology is curtailed,\u201d said Agn\u00e8s Callamard.\n\nAmnesty International exposed how Facebook\u2019s algorithms contributed to ethnic violence in Ethiopia in the context of armed conflict. This is a prime example of how technology is weaponized to pit communities against each other, particularly in times of instability.\n\nThe human rights organization forecasts that these problems will escalate in a landmark election year, with the surveillance-based business model underpinning major social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and YouTube acting as a catalyst for human rights violations in the context of elections.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen how hate, discrimination and disinformation are amplified and spread by social media algorithms optimized to maximize \u2018engagement\u2019 above all else. They create an endless and dangerous feedback loop, particularly at times of heightened political sensitivity. Tools can generate synthetic images, audio and video in seconds, as well as target specific audience groups at scale, but electoral regulation has yet to catch up with this threat. To date we\u2019ve seen too much talk with too little action,\u201d said Agn\u00e8s Callamard.\n\nIn November, the US presidential election will take place in the face of increasing discrimination, harassment and abuse on social media platforms towards marginalized communities including LGBTI people. Threatening and intimidating anti-abortion content has also become rife.\n\nAbout a billion people are voting in India\u2019s election this year against a backdrop of attacks on peaceful protesters and systematic discrimination against religious minorities. In 2023 Amnesty International revealed that invasive spyware had been used to target prominent Indian journalists, and more broadly tech platforms have become political battlefields.\n\n\u201cPoliticians have long used manipulation of \u2018us vs. them\u2019 narratives to win votes and outmanoeuvre legitimate questions about economic and security fears. We\u2019ve seen how unregulated technologies, such as facial recognition, have been used to entrench discrimination. Coupled with this, Big Tech\u2019s surveillance business model is pouring fuel on this fire of hate, enabling those with malintent to hound, dehumanize and amplify dangerous narratives to consolidate power or polling. It\u2019s a chilling spectre of what\u2019s to come as technological advances rapaciously outpace accountability,\u201d said Agn\u00e8s Callamard.",

        "text": "The Gaza War Still Can Decide the American Presidential Election\nLatest polls indicate that President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are in a dead heat in the presidential race at this point in the campaign, which is only six and a half months away from the election on November 5. How each candidate can move the needle depends on several factors, including the state of the economy and whether Trump is convicted of felonies in his current or upcoming trials. Normally, US presidential elections are determined by domestic issues, but this time around foreign policy will also play a significant role, especially the war in Gaza. Important Democrat Party constituencies in key battleground states are disillusioned with Biden\u2019s indulgence of Israel and neglect of the plight of the Palestinians. Biden is undoubtedly hoping that the war in Gaza that has dogged his campaign will end soon, but that hope may be based more on wishful thinking than concrete evidence. Given that both candidates have political liabilities, the election contest is likely to remain tight up through November.\n\nD\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu All Over Again\n\nThat Biden and Trump are again to face off against each other has dampened the enthusiasm of the American people for the November election. Although Biden, a longtime politician and Washington establishment figure, has returned \u201cnormalcy\u201d to the White House after the chaotic years of the Trump presidency, many Americans see him as too old and feeble to take on four more years. For his part, Trump is only a few years younger than Biden, but is seen as more vigorous than the incumbent. But he has numerous legal troubles and several trials ahead of him beside his current one in New York. This has hindered his ability to stage numerous campaign rallies and raise sufficient campaign funds at this point. Biden, like before, is trying to portray Trump as a threat to democracy, given his opponent\u2019s admiration for authoritarian leaders, while Trump is trying to paint Biden and his family as \u201ccrooked\u201d for alleged misdeeds. This reciprocal labeling has caused many Americans to turn away from the presidential campaign and, while each candidate has his share of diehard supporters, many people will likely go to the polls to vote against a candidate rather than for one.\n\nEconomic and Social Factors\n\nTo borrow the phrase coined by former President Bill Clinton\u2019s colorful campaign strategist, James Carville, \u201cit\u2019s the economy, stupid.\u201d Like most other elections, economic issues will likely predominate in the 2024 election. The Biden camp, including Democrats running for Congress, will tout the fact that the economy has been exhibiting remarkable growth and the unemployment rate is at record lows. Trump and the Republicans are highlighting rising inflation, which stood at 3.5 percent in March (in part because of higher gasoline prices) and high mortgage rates (currently running at 7.1 percent on average) as hurting the American family and new home buyers. The Biden team, hoping that inflation and mortgage rates will drop by November, is also touting the massive government spending in the so-called Inflation Reduction Act\u2014a very large infrastructure bill that included support for renewable energy\u2014that was passed in 2022 as an important boon to the economy. By contrast, Trump and the Republicans see that bill with its high spending as contributing to inflation and high interest rates for borrowers. Trump has claimed he built \u201cthe greatest economy in the world\u201d during his presidency, while Biden has caused \u201csoaring inflation.\u201d\n\nIn addition, social issues like abortion will also be front and center in the campaign. Knowing how divisive abortion is among the public (a majority of Americans are in favor of legalizing the procedure), Trump has tried to steer a middle course, taking credit for appointing conservative justices to the Supreme Court which in 2022 overturned the 1973 landmark Roe v. Wade decision which had made abortion legal in the entire United States. Trump now says that abortion should be left to individual states, implying that there should be no nationwide legislative ban as most Christian evangelicals, who are part of his political base, would like. Although the latter group, including Trump\u2019s Vice President Mike Pence, have criticized this position as a betrayal of the pro-life movement, they are not going to throw their support behind Biden and the Democrats who have called the overturning of Roe v. Wade a grave mistake.\n\nTrump faces several legal trials which could work against him even though he tries to play the role of a martyr to his base.\n\nImmigration and crime have also risen to the forefront of the campaign. Trump, Republicans, and their media echo chamber are criticizing Biden for the large influx of migrants who have crossed the southern border following his administration\u2019s lifting Trump\u2019s more draconian policies there. House Republicans even succeeded in impeaching Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas for the supposedly lax border policy (although the Senate rejected putting him on trial). Biden and the Democrats have countered that they had reached a legislative compromise with Republicans in Congress on immigration earlier this year, only to have Trump use his influence among Republican legislators to scuttle the deal because he wanted to use the issue as a wedge against Biden and the Democrats. On crime, Trump and Republicans are claiming how unsafe the American major cities have become under Biden\u2019s watch. According to a Gallup poll, 77 percent of Americans believe crime has gone up, whereas in reality it has declined nationwide, according to the FBI, except in the case of a few cities.\n\nBut unlike Biden, Trump faces several legal trials which could work against him even though he tries to play the role of a martyr to his base by claiming that the proceedings are all politically motivated. According to a recent AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll, only one-third of Americans believe that he did anything illegal by paying hush money to a porn star\u2014the basis for his current trial in New York. However, half of all Americans believe if he is convicted in this case of falsifying business records to cover up these payments, he should be deemed unfit to serve as president again. Moreover, half of all Americans believe Trump\u2019s other, pending trials, involve more serious charges. To be sure, Trump\u2019s base will support him despite all allegations, and Democrats will tend to believe Trump is guilty of all of the charges, but it is the independents who could tip the balance here. Although the Constitution is silent on whether a citizen can run for president from jail, the optics of such a development would likely turn many of these independents away from Trump. Hence, while Biden may be vulnerable on the economy (especially the high cost of living) and the immigration issue, Trump is vulnerable on his legal challenges, especially if he is found guilty of a felony.\n\nIsrael, Gaza, and the Changing Views of the Electorate\n\nThe Israeli-Palestinian issue has not only highlighted differences between Republicans and Democrats, but it has also divided Democrats and galvanized the younger generation of Americans.\n\nBiden is of an older generation of Democrats that has remained unreservedly pro-Israel, and this position was evident by his close embrace of it in the immediate aftermath of Hamas\u2019s October 7 attack. Biden\u2019s decision to travel to Israel and meet with its war cabinet gave the optics of giving Israel the green light to mount an offensive in Gaza as it saw fit. However, when Palestinian civilian casualties started to mount and Israel restricted humanitarian supplies into Gaza, Biden found himself in a political quandary, as members of his own party in Congress and key constituencies criticized his administration\u2019s stand on the war.\n\nA growing number of Democrats in Congress, and not just those on the left, have called on Biden to restrict US arms to Israel or place conditionality on military supplies in the wake of its indiscriminate attacks on Gaza and its failure to allow for more humanitarian aid to enter the Strip to aid stricken civilians. These sentiments are to some degree reflective of the party\u2019s changing views in recent years toward the Israeli-Palestinian situation. A Quinnipiac University poll in mid-November 2023, for example, showed that, among Democratic voters, 41 percent said they sympathize with the Palestinians compared to 34 percent who said they sympathize with the Israelis, while 25 percent said they were undecided. In addition, there is a growing age gap in the Democrat Party between younger and older people on this issue. About 69 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters under the age of 35 disapprove of Biden\u2019s handling of the Israel-Hamas war, with only 24 percent approving it. By contrast, 77 percent of Democrats 65 years and older approve of Biden\u2019s handling of the war, with only 16 percent disapproving it.\n\nThis age gap within the party is reflective of American society in general. A recent Pew poll found that a third of Americans under the age of 30 say they sympathize entirely or mostly with the Palestinians while only 14 percent say they sympathize with the Israelis. The remainder say their sympathies are with both or are undecided. By contrast, among Americans 65 years and older, 47 percent say they sympathize with the Israelis, while only 9 percent say they sympathize with the Palestinians, with 27 percent saying they sympathize with both groups.\n\nPerhaps taking these numbers into account, Biden has called Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza \u201cover the top\u201d and has sanctioned some settlers in the West Bank for their violent acts against Palestinians. Still, his administration has rejected putting any conditionality on military aid or sales to Israel. In fact, Biden is on track to sign a massive aid package for Israel that has passed the House of Representatives and the US Senate.\n\nBiden found himself in a political quandary, as members of his own party criticized his administration\u2019s stand on the war.\n\nSuch one-sided policies have particularly upset the Arab-American and Muslim-American communities who overwhelmingly supported Biden in the 2020 election not only because they objected to Trump\u2019s harsh anti-Muslim rhetoric but believed Biden would be more even-handed on the Israeli-Palestinian issue. In the important battleground state of Michigan which went for Trump in 2016 and for Biden in 2020 by small margins, the Arab-American vote, or lack thereof, could be decisive this November. Already, activists in the community have shown their clout by running a successful \u201cuncommitted\u201d campaign in the February 2024 Democratic primary (which garnered over 100,000 of such responses on the ballot), a warning to Biden that he needs to change his policies.\n\nIn addition, African-Americans, who voted 90 percent for Biden in 2020, have been increasingly focused on the war in Gaza, showing sympathy for the Palestinians. According to an early February New York Times/Siena College poll, 34 percent of African-American voters sympathize with Palestinians compared to 28 percent who sympathize with the Israelis. And, like the above-mentioned statistics, these differences are more pronounced by age. African-Americans, and not just those of the Muslim faith, have been increasingly focused on the plight of the Palestinians, seeing a similar path of historical subjugation. One prominent African-American pastor of the Mother Bethel AME Church in Pennsylvania, Reverend Mark Tyler, told a reporter: \u201cI want the president to get it right [on the Palestinian issue] because it\u2019s right.\u201d He added that he has lost count of the number of conversations he has had with parishioners on the Israeli-Palestinian situation.\n\nWhile Biden is losing support from these key constituencies, they are unlikely to switch to Trump. As is known, when Trump was president he fully embraced Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s agenda, which included the sidelining of the Palestinian issue. The Republican Party also has remained solidly behind Israel even during the current Gaza operation which has killed over 34,000 Palestinians. The most Trump has said on the issue is that the Hamas attacks of October 7 would never have happened under his presidency and that Israel needs to \u201cget it [the war against Hamas] over with fast.\u201d Nonetheless, the danger for Biden is that many in these constituencies might simply stay home on election day in November as a form of protest. A no-show on election day might very well tilt the electoral contest in Trump\u2019s favor in key battleground states like Michigan and Pennsylvania.\n\nImpact of the New Foreign Aid Bill\n\nAfter months of wrangling over aid to Ukraine, which divided the House Republicans and held up additional aid for Israel and Taiwan, the House and Senate finally passed a supplemental foreign aid package of $95 billion to Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan. The bill includes a whopping $26 billion in additional aid to Israel, with $9.1 billion of this particular amount slated for humanitarian assistance to the Palestinians. Although the Biden administration is trying to sell the bill to the disaffected constituencies as providing \u201cdesperately needed humanitarian aid to Gaza,\u201d Muslim-American leaders see it differently, focusing on the large imbalance going to Israel. Some have called the bill an \u201cabsolute disaster\u201d and said they are \u201coutraged.\u201d Moreover, the bill forbids any assistance to UNRWA, the UN agency that has provided relief and development assistance to Palestinian refugees since 1949, and comes on the heels of the US veto of a UN Security Council resolution that aimed to give the Palestinians full UN membership (they currently have observer status).\n\nAlthough it is difficult to predict the outcome of the November elections at this point, Biden and the Democrats are undoubtedly hoping for an end to the war in Gaza, a slowdown in the inflation rate, and a felony conviction in Trump\u2019s legal troubles. But if any of these things do not happen, a Trump return to the White House and Republican control of both houses of Congress is within reach.\n\nThe views expressed in this publication are the author\u2019s own and do not necessarily reflect the position of Arab Center Washington DC, its staff, or its Board of Directors.\n\nFeatured image credit: Shutterstock/Matt Smith",

        "text": "Biden just signed a bill that could ban TikTok. His campaign plans to stay on the app anyway\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 When President Joe Biden showed off his putting during a campaign stop at a public golf course in Michigan last month, the moment was captured on TikTok.\n\nForced inside by a rainstorm, he competed with 13-year-old Hurley \u201cHJ\u201d Coleman IV to make putts on a practice mat. The Coleman family posted video of the proceedings on the app \u2014 complete with Biden holing out a putt and the teen knocking his own shot home in response, over the caption, \u201cI had to sink the rebuttal.\u201d\n\nThe network television cameras that normally follow the president were stuck outside.\n\nBiden signed legislation Wednesday that could ban TikTok in the U.S. while his campaign has embraced the platform and tried to work with influencers. Already struggling to maintain his previous support from younger voters, the president is now facing criticism from some avid users of the app, which researchers have found is a primary news source for a third of Americans under the age of 30.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a core hypocrisy to the Biden administration supporting the TikTok ban while at the same time using TikTok for his campaign purposes,\u201d said Kahlil Greene, who has more than 650,000 followers and is known on TikTok as the \u201cGen Z Historian.\u201d\n\nWhat to know about Trump\u2019s second term:\n\nStaffing the administration: Here are the people Trump has picked recess appointments Follow all of our coverage as Donald Trump assembles his second administration.\n\n\u201cI think it illustrates that he and his people know the power and necessity of TikTok.\u201d\n\nThe Biden campaign defends its approach and rejects the idea that White House policy is contradicting its political efforts.\n\n\u201cWe would be silly to write off any place where people are getting information about the president,\u201d said Rob Flaherty, who ran the White House\u2019s Office of Digital Strategy and now is deputy manager of Biden\u2019s reelection campaign.\n\nFlaherty said Biden\u2019s team forged relationships with TikTok influencers the 2020 election and that the platform has only gotten more influential since then, \u201cgrowing as an internet search engine and driving narratives about the president.\u201d\n\nThe Biden campaign says that an increasingly fragmented modern media environment requires it to meet voters where they are and that TikTok is one of many such places where would-be supporters see its content, in addition to platforms like WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube.\n\nIt has produced its own TikTok content, but also relied on everyday users who interact with the president. That includes a post from a family that ate fries and other fixings from the Cook Out fast food chain when Biden recently visited Raleigh, North Carolina, as well as Coleman\u2019s putting video.\n\nOpponents of TikTok say its ownership by Chinese company ByteDance gives Beijing a dangerous amount of influence over what narratives Americans see as well as potential access to U.S. user data. Chinese national-security laws allow the ruling Communist Party wide latitude over private business, though the U.S. has not made public evidence that the Chinese government has manipulated the app or forced ByteDance to do its bidding.\n\nThe law Biden signed Wednesday would force ByteDance to sell the app to a U.S. company within a year or face a national ban. ByteDance has argued the law violates the First Amendment and promised to sue.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, now publicly opposes a TikTok ban after issuing an executive order while in office trying to ban the app if ByteDance didn\u2019t sell it.\n\nThe White House doesn\u2019t have an official TikTok account and Biden banned the app on most government devices in December 2022. Yet the Biden campaign also officially joined TikTok on the night of this year\u2019s Super Bowl, as the president shunned a traditional gameday TV interview to instead spread a political message with the platform.\n\nFormer White House press secretary Jen Psaki convened a virtual briefing in 2022 for more than two dozen of the app\u2019s influencers to discuss the U.S. approach to Ukraine, a gathering later parodied on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d\n\nThere have been scores of other such events, including an influencer party at the White House last Christmas and a State of the Union watch party in March. During Biden\u2019s recent, $26 million campaign fundraiser at New York\u2019s Radio City Music Hall with former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, there was an influencer happy hour and an after-party where attendees interacted with Biden.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that the legislation Biden signed \u201cis not a ban. This is about our national security.\u201d She added that the White House isn\u2019t saying \u201cthat we do not want Americans to use TikTok.\u201d\n\nTikTok has 170 million U.S. users and a study released last November by the Pew Research Center found that about a third of U.S. adults under 30 regularly got news from TikTok, compared to 14% of all adults.\n\nAdults under 30 are more likely than U.S. adults overall to oppose a ban on the use of TikTok in the United States, according to an AP-NORC poll conducted in January. Nearly half of 18- to 29-year-olds are opposed, compared to 35% of U.S. adults.\n\nAbout 2 in 10 U.S. adults said then they use TikTok at least once a day, including 44% of 18- to 29-year-olds. Among 18- to 29-year-olds, 7% say they use TikTok \u201calmost constantly\u201d and an additional 28% are using it \u201cseveral times a day.\u201d\n\nPriorities USA, a leading Democratic super PAC, is spending around $1 million this cycle to help fund more than 100 TikTok influencers who produce pro-Biden content ahead of November, and views those efforts as an extension of traditional organizing and communications initiatives.\n\nEven if TikTok is eventually banned, most of its influencers are on other platforms that could continue to take their content, especially YouTube and Instagram, said Danielle Butterfield, Priorities USA\u2019s executive director.\n\n\u201cTikTok users are online generally and that\u2019s a lot of different places,\u201d said Butterfield, who was also deputy director of digital advertising for Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nBiden, meanwhile, has seen his standing with young people decline. About one-third of adults under 30 approve of how he\u2019s handling his job as president, according to an AP-NORC poll conducted in March \u2014 a sharp drop from the roughly two-thirds approved when he first entered office.\n\nGreene studied history at Yale, served as the school\u2019s first Black student body president and graduated in 2022. He attended past White House events as an influencer, including a Juneteenth celebration and a West Wing event for the Inflation Reduction Act, a sweeping health care and green energy package, where he met both Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nAbout a year ago, however, Greene says he began posting about Biden\u2019s championing a sweeping 1994 crime law that activists have long said contributed to the mass incarceration of racial minorities. He also criticized Biden\u2019s current administration for what he called \u201ca lack of specific policy made for Black Americans.\u201d\n\nSince then, while Greene continues to receive more general emails from the Biden administration, he said says he\u2019s no longer invited to more personal events while some \u201ccreators who fell in line, who are less critical\u201d are still going.\n\nFlaherty, Biden\u2019s deputy campaign manager, said the campaign has paid influencers in specific instances, like when their content has been used in ads, and that some content creators who work with the campaign have raised concerns about legislation forcing divestment. But he doesn\u2019t see it having a major Election Day impact.\n\n\u201cI think young voters aren\u2019t going to vote on TikTok,\u201d Flaherty said. \u201cThey are going to vote on issues, which are discussed on TikTok but they\u2019re also discussed other places.\u201d\n\nGreene, however, said young voters\u2019 frustration with the Biden administration in other areas \u2014 particularly its handling of Israel-Hamas war \u2014 have combined with the TikTok divestment legislation to spell political problems for Biden.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no ability for me to overstate how that exacerbates the outcry,\u201d he said, \u201cand the dissatisfaction that people already have.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Linley Sanders contributed to this report.",

        "text": "Analysis: Supreme Court will weigh whether Trump is immune from prosecution. Here\u2019s what to watch\nThe U.S. Supreme Court wraps up arguments for this term with two of the most contentious issues of the year: abortion and former President Donald Trump\u2019s claim of absolute immunity from prosecution.\n\nAlthough recent chief justices have tried to front-load arguments in the term\u2019s first half to give the justices more time for thoughtful writing of opinions when spring arrives, that effort usually fails. The court has no control over when cases arrive at its door, although it does control whether and when to grant review.\n\nThe justices almost always finish oral arguments during the last week of April, but this year, the final week is a bit unusual. That\u2019s both because the court is holding arguments on a Thursday (the court rarely goes beyond Wednesday in argument weeks) and because it is the Trump case, with potentially huge implications for the 2024 election.\n\nLISTEN LIVE: Supreme Court hears case on presidential immunity for Trump\n\nTrump\u2019s petition for review was filed and granted in February, after the usual cutoff date for adding cases to the current term. The court simply extended the final April week by one day to ensure the case is heard and decided this term. Just how quickly the justices will act, and whether it will be in time for a federal trial before the November election, are questions that only they can answer.\n\nThat case, Trump v. United States, raises an unprecedented claim of absolute immunity from prosecution for allegedly official acts by the former president. But that\u2019s not the only legal and political maelstrom at the court. Moyle v. United States and Idaho v. United States, two combined cases, mark the first time the justices have reviewed a state law criminalizing abortion since they eliminated the nearly 50-year-old right to abortion in 2022.\n\nLet\u2019s take them one at a time, in reverse order, with an eye on what to watch for on argument day.\n\nTrump v. United States\n\n\n\nThe Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in Trump v. United States on Thursday, April 25 at 10 a.m. EST. Listen to them in the player above.\n\nThe stakes in Trump v. United States are incredibly high, and not just for Trump. The question before the justices goes to the heart of presidential accountability and the nation\u2019s rule of law, and arises from Trump\u2019s defense to his federal indictment for conspiring \u201cto overturn the legitimate results of the 2020 presidential election.\u201d With the next election months away, and Trump the presumptive Republican nominee, the outcome of this case could affect the timing and substance of Trump\u2019s federal trial, the electorate\u2019s view of Trump\u2019s candidacy and, most importantly, the role and powers of presidents in our democracy.\n\nThe justices are asked to decide whether and to what extent a former president enjoys immunity from criminal prosecution for conduct alleged to involve official acts during his tenure in office. The arguments will involve clauses of the Constitution, their text, historical practice and the scope of \u201cofficial acts.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s arguments. His bottom-line argument is that his immunity should be absolute and extend to the outer perimeter of his official duties. He reaches that result by making four arguments:\n\nFirst, Article II of the Constitution, which vests the executive power in a president, and the separation of powers doctrine, say courts lack authority to sit in judgment over the president\u2019s official acts. From Marbury v. Madison forward, Trump argues in his brief, courts have refused to exercise jurisdiction over a president\u2019s official acts. He also uses the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Nixon v. Fitzgerald to claim that presidents have absolute immunity from civil liability for official acts: \u201cA fortiori, Article III courts cannot sit in criminal judgment over a President\u2019s official acts,\u201d Trump\u2019s brief reads.\n\nSecond, Trump was impeached by the House but never convicted by the Senate. The impeachment judgment clause in the Constitution confirms his argument, he claims, because it dictates that the president cannot be prosecuted unless he is first impeached and convicted by the Senate.\n\nThird, no former president was ever prosecuted for official acts until 2023. The lack of historical precedent is a \u201ctelling indication\u201d of a serious problem with prosecution for official acts.\n\nFourth, \u201cThe threat of future prosecution will cripple current Presidential decisionmaking.\u201d\n\nThe United States responds by making four arguments:\n\nFirst, there is no presidential power that entitles the president to claim immunity from general federal criminal laws supporting the charges against Trump,\u201d Special Counsel Jack Smith argues in the government\u2019s brief. \u201cThe President\u2019s constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed does not entail a general right to violate them.\u201d\n\nSecond, history also refutes Trump\u2019s claim. All presidents, from the Founding Fathers to the modern era, knew after leaving office they faced potential criminal liability for official acts. For an example, see Richard Nixon\u2019s official acts in Watergate and his acceptance of a presidential pardon.\n\nThird, Nixon v. Fitzgerald, involving civil immunity, doesn\u2019t help Trump because it doesn\u2019t extend to the far weightier interest in vindicating federal criminal law.\n\nFourth, the impeachment judgment clause does not make Senate conviction a condition precedent to prosecution. It expressly recognizes that former presidents may be prosecuted.\n\nWill the \u201cSEAL Team Six\u201d hypothetical get replayed? During the January lower appellate court arguments in Trump\u2019s immunity appeal, a judge asked Trump\u2019s lawyer if a president could order SEAL Team Six to assassinate a political opponent and be immune from prosecution. His lawyer\u2019s \u201cqualified yes\u201d drew strong reactions across social media and beyond.\n\nWill a Supreme Court justice ask it this time? Be prepared for some unusual hypotheticals as the justices probe the boundaries of each side\u2019s arguments.\n\nMoyle v. United States and Idaho v. United States\n\n\n\nThe Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in Moyle v. United States and Idaho v. United States on Wednesday, April 24 at 10 a.m. EST. Listen to them in the player above.\n\nWelcome to the world of federal \u201cpreemption.\u201d\n\nThe Idaho abortion case involves a federal law and a state law. The issue is whether the state law, Idaho\u2019s Defense of Life Act, conflicts with the federal law, the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), a provision of the federal Medicare Act. If the state law is a direct conflict, then federal law preempts it \u2014 blocks it \u2014 because federal law is supreme.\n\nThe justices are very familiar with preemption analysis. Expect them to press the lawyers on each side about how the two laws conflict by parsing the language and requirements of both.\n\nREAD MORE: What\u2019s EMTALA, the federal law at the center of the Supreme Court\u2019s Idaho abortion case?\n\nThe Idaho law makes it a crime punishable by up to five years in prison for anyone who performs or attempts to perform an abortion. The only exceptions are abortions to prevent the death of the woman, to end ectopic and molar pregnancies, and some resulting from rape and incest. But EMTALA requires Medicare-participating hospitals that offer emergency services to provide stabilizing treatment for patients with emergency medical conditions, and an abortion may be necessary to treat a condition that falls outside of Idaho\u2019s exceptions to abortion.\n\nWhat is the meaning of EMTALA\u2019s requirement to provide stabilizing emergency care? Idaho argues in its brief that EMTALA, enacted in 1986, was designed to deal with so-called \u201cpatient dumping.\u201d Some hospitals were discharging or transfering severely ill patients because they had no insurance. EMTALA says nothing about abortion, has no standard of medical care and would turn emergency rooms into abortion clinics in violation of state law, according to the state\u2019s brief.\n\n\u201cEMTALA merely prohibits emergency rooms from turning away indigent patients with serious medical conditions,\u201d Idaho argues. \u201cRejecting the identical arguments advanced here, the Fifth Circuit recently held that \u2018EMTALA does not mandate any specific type of medical treatment, let alone abortion.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe United States counters in its brief that EMTALA has a broader scope than Idaho contends. The act states that when \u201cany individual comes to a [participating] hospital\u201d with an \u201cemergency medical condition,\u201d the hospital must offer such treatment \u201cas may be required to stabilize the medical condition.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor some pregnant women suffering tragic emergency complications, the only care that can prevent grave harm to their health is termination of the pregnancy,\u201d the United States argues. \u201cIn those circumstances, EMTALA requires participating hospitals to offer such care \u2014 yet Idaho law forbids it. EMTALA accordingly preempts state laws like Section 18-622 to the extent they prohibit the essential medical care required by federal law.\u201d\n\nWhat will the women justices say? The Idaho abortion case is the second abortion case of the term. The justices already heard arguments in a challenge to the medical abortion drug, mifepristone. Medication abortion is now the method used in more than half of all abortions. During those arguments, it was particularly striking how the court\u2019s four women justices were so clearly better informed about the medical side of abortion and the female body than their male counterparts. If they had not been present, key insights and information would have been absent. Expect them to play an important role if not on the bench then later in the conference discussion as well.\n\nIf the conservative majority that eliminated the abortion right in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization thought that returning the legality of abortion to the states would make them \u2014 in the words of Justice Brett Kavanaugh \u2014 \u201cneutral\u201d on the issue then after this term they must realize that it was wishful thinking.",

        "text": "Mexican presidential candidate would be country's first woman leader with Jewish roots\nMexico is holding their biggest election yet in June, including selecting a new president who is likely to make history.\n\nMexico's President Andre\u0301s Manuel Lo\u0301pez Obrador has reached his term limit, and when the two leading political parties put forward women as their candidates, it became all but certain the winner of the June 2 presidential election will be the country's first female leader.\n\nFormer Mexico City mayor and ruling party candidate Claudia Sheinbaum, also known as Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo, is the favorite to win the race, and as Reuters reported, she shows an increasing lead in local polls.\n\nNot only would she be the first woman president of Mexico, she would also be the first president with a Jewish background.\n\nHere is what else to know about the front runner in Mexico's presidential race:\n\nInternational politics at home:Ukraine, Israel aid package heads to Biden as Congress caps months-long struggle\n\nWho is Claudia Sheinbaum?\n\nSheinbaum is the presidential candidate for the leftist National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) party. Morena is the current ruling party with President Andre\u0301s Manuel Lo\u0301pez Obrador.\n\nSheinbaum, 61, was the mayor of Mexico City from December 2018, until stepping down to pursue the presidential candidacy.\n\nShe has a Jewish background in her four grandparents who immigrated from Lithuania and Bulgaria, according to the Associated Press, but calls herself a woman of faith who does not adhere to any religion. Mexico's population is 78% Roman Catholic, according to 2020 census data.\n\nSheinbaum is tailed at a distance by candidates Xo\u0301chitl Ga\u0301lvez and Jorge A\u0301lvarez Ma\u0301ynez in the polls. If elected, she would serve a six-year term until 2030.\n\nLeftist candidate Claudia Sheinbaum wants to focus on renewable energy\n\nSheinbaum is scientist specializing in energy with a Ph.D from National Autonomous University of Mexico. She has served on the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change as part of a team that won a 2007 Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nShe recently unveiled an ambitious plan to pledge $13.6 billion in wind and solar power generation projects, according to Reuters. It would be a break from the current president's policies which invested in the state oil company Pemex, though Sheinbaum generally wants to continue with President Lo\u0301pez Obrador's legacy if elected.\n\n\"We are working on the national energy plan not only through 2030, but to 2050,\" Sheinbaum said, according to Reuters.\n\nMexico and US to navigate new relationships after 2024 elections\n\nMexico's next president will have to contend with the elections happening next door as the U.S. is likely headed for a rematch between former President Donald Trump and current President Joe Biden. But Mexican voters choice could also play a role in some key aspects of the U.S. elections.\n\nImmigration is a big issue for many voters in the 2024 presidential election, not to mention responses to climate change and conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza require international coordination.\n\nA rematch between Biden and Trump, both who have been president while current Mexico President Lo\u0301pez Obrador has been in office, offers insight into how the relationship might continue if Morena remains the governing party through the Mexican presidential election.\n\nAP called Lo\u0301pez Obrador's relationship with Trump \"strangely warm,\" considering Trump's rhetoric about building a wall on their shared border. AP also said Lo\u0301pez Obrador had fewer public disagreements with Trump than Biden.\n\nBut Bloomberg reported Sheinbaum says that, if elected, she would maintain a \"good relationship\" with the next U.S. president, given the close economic ties.\n\nContributing: Corrie Boudreaux, El Paso Times; Reuters",

(Sophia Schmidt/WHYY)\n\nOutside a polling place on the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s campus, a small group of people urged students entering the building to write in \u201cUncommitted,\u201d rather than cast a vote for President Joe Biden in the presidential primary race. They hope to send a message to Biden that they reject U.S. support for Israel during the country\u2019s war in Gaza, which has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians since the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas.\n\n\u201cFor way too long, the Democratic Party has just accepted that they\u2019ll have the Muslim vote,\u201d said Rayane, a student who is a registered independent and could not vote in Tuesday\u2019s primary.

They hope to organize at least 40,000 \u201cUncommitted\u201d write-in votes Tuesday.

He declined to say whether he supported Uncommitted PA\u2019s specific demands.\n\n\u201cThese types of nonviolent civil disobedience, direct actions, organizing \u2014 this is what\u2019s made our country better,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should be supporting the state of Israel as long as they\u2019re doing what they\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\n\u00bb READ MORE: The Uncommitted: Pa. primary is another litmus test for Biden\u2019s handling of Israel-Hamas war in Gaza",

        "text": "Trump meets with foreign leaders looking to boost their relationships with GOP leader ahead of election\nCNN \u2014\n\nDonald Trump no longer commands the trappings of White House state dinners to host foreign dignitaries or the flight itinerary of Air Force One to meet them abroad, but that hasn\u2019t stopped the former president from huddling with world leaders eager to bolster their relationship with the presumptive Republican nominee amid another close presidential election campaign.\n\nIn recent weeks, Trump, seizing the role of both an erstwhile diplomat and ascending opposition party leader, has extended welcomes to a series of foreign leaders at his homes in Florida and New York. He dined with Polish President Andrzej Duda in New York during the first week of his hush money trial, hosted British Foreign Secretary David Cameron at his Mar-a-Lago club the week before and has spoken by phone with the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman recently, among other high-profile meetings.\n\nThe latest rendezvous came Tuesday night. After leaving the Manhattan courthouse, Trump had dinner with former Japanese prime minister Taro Aso, a senior official in his country\u2019s ruling party. The two discussed the importance of the US-Japan alliance, as well as challenges posed by China and North Korea, according to a readout of the meeting from the Trump campaign.\n\nIt\u2019s not unusual for foreign leaders to meet with the leader of the party that doesn\u2019t control the White House \u2013 especially one with a serious chance of becoming commander in chief. In the throes of his 2008 presidential campaign, then-freshman Sen. Barack Obama famously embarked on an overseas trip where he met with European and Middle East leaders and delivered a rousing address to 200,000 onlookers in Berlin. Challenging Obama four years later, Republican nominee Mitt Romney visited the United Kingdom, Israel and Poland as he sought to burnish his foreign policy credentials.\n\nBiden and his top envoys have also met and spoken with opposition leaders, something that has been a longstanding practice for US officials.\n\nIn March 2022, Biden spoke by phone with Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, the opposition leader of Belarus, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with UK Labour Party leader Keir Starmer in Munich in February, among other meetings.\n\nStill, Trump finds himself in a distinct position. It is exceptionally rare that a presidential candidate has previously carried out a foreign policy doctrine, filled the US State Department with his diplomatic appointments and built relationships with the same leaders now arriving on his doorstep.\n\nThe pace of these meetings in the middle of a campaign has also presented a new dynamic for President Joe Biden to grapple with as his administration confronts a host of challenges abroad.\n\nThe US State Department did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nA person close to Trump described the meetings as friendly encounters and downplayed them as unsurprising given his past relationships with many of these figures.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re seeking him out, he\u2019s not seeking them out,\u201d the person said. \u201cThey clearly want to get their insights into how he views the world, and many think he could be president again or they wouldn\u2019t fly to Mar-a-Lago or New York to meet with him.\u201d\n\nThe worldviews of Biden and Trump have long been at odds, and they have publicly litigated their dueling approaches to foreign allies and adversaries dating back to the 2020 presidential campaign.\n\nBiden as a candidate promised to strengthen ties with America\u2019s traditional overseas partners, especially in Europe, and criticized Trump for praising instead of challenging rival foreign powers such as Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nAt a meeting of NATO countries last month in Poland, Biden pledged that America would remain a stalwart in foreign affairs and continue to defend against Putin\u2019s aggression.\n\n\u201cWhen we stand together, no force on earth is more powerful,\u201d Biden said.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump regularly insists the wars that have broken out in Ukraine and between Israel and Hamas would not have occurred on his watch. At rallies, Trump has called Xi \u201ca very smart guy, very strong leader,\u201d used Putin\u2019s words to criticize Biden and told a crowd that he had a \u201ca very good relationship\u201d with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, who would \u201clove to see me back.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey say that\u2019s terrible,\u201d Trump said. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not terrible. It\u2019s called smart.\u201d\n\nIn a statement to CNN, Trump campaign spokesman Brian Hughes said the former president\u2019s recent meetings with leaders \u201creflect the recognition of what we already know here at home. Joe Biden is weak, and when President Trump is sworn in as the 47th President of the United States, the world will be more secure and America will be more prosperous.\u201d\n\nSome of the leaders whom Trump has engaged have been at times at odds with Biden. Trump, for example, recently hosted Hungarian President Viktor Orban, who frequently shows deference to Putin, and he embraced backstage with Argentina\u2019s new right-wing populist leader Javier Milei at this year\u2019s Conservative Political Action Conference.\n\nDuring the evening with Orban, amid a concert at his Palm Beach resort, the former president heaped accolades on the European autocrat, telling the crowd: \u201cThere\u2019s nobody that\u2019s better, smarter or a better leader than Viktor Orb\u00e1n. He\u2019s fantastic.\u201d\n\nThe meeting was illustrative of Trump\u2019s history of embracing global strongmen \u2013 at times at the expense of more traditional US allies. A Biden administration official confirmed to CNN at the time that the White House did not extend an invitation to the authoritarian leader to meet with Biden, and Orb\u00e1n did not request a White House meeting during his trip to the US.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s incursions into foreign affairs have also brought him in close proximity with America\u2019s partners abroad.\n\nTrump\u2019s meeting with Aso comes just two weeks after Biden hosted Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida at the White House for a state visit. Both Aso and Kishida are leaders in Japan\u2019s ruling Liberal Democratic Party, which is the country\u2019s major conservative political party.\n\nDuring the state dinner earlier this month, Biden touted the US-Japan alliance as being \u201cstronger than it\u2019s ever been\u201d and announced new plans for military cooperation with the country. Japan has been at the center of Biden\u2019s alliance-building in the Indo-Pacific region, with Kishida significantly shifting the country\u2019s defense posture in recent years and providing ongoing support to Ukraine.\n\nTrump also spoke by phone in March with Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince, two sources familiar with the call told CNN. The call, first reported by the New York Times, was arranged by Sen. Lindsey Graham while the South Carolina Republican was visiting Salman. The conversation came as the Biden administration is working behind the scenes to establish formal diplomatic relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel, a deal that the White House views as a crucial part of negotiations to end the conflict between Israel and Hamas.\n\nTrump also spoke by phone with King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa of Bahrain, a longtime American ally, in March, two sources familiar with the conversation told CNN. The New York Times first reported the details of the call.\n\nLast week, Trump met with Poland\u2019s Duda at Trump Tower, where the two discussed NATO spending over dinner. Duda has proposed that NATO countries increase their pledge to spend 3% of their GDP on defense, up from 2%.\n\nTrump, both while president and during his 2024 campaign, has called on NATO countries to spend more on defense. During a campaign rally in February, Trump said he would encourage Russia to do \u201cwhatever the hell they want\u201d to any NATO member country that doesn\u2019t meet spending guidelines. The stunning remark received swift backlash from Republicans and Democrats alike, and raised concerns that Trump may not abide by the collective-defense clause at the heart of the NATO alliance if reelected.\n\nDuda, meanwhile, previously spoke about the proposal with Biden at the March NATO gathering, telling the American president: \u201cTwo percent was good ten years ago. Now three percent is required in response to the full-scale war launched by Russia right beyond NATO\u2019s eastern border.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, Trump also discussed NATO defense spending and the Russia-Ukraine war over dinner with Cameron, the British foreign secretary, at his Mar-a-Lago resort. Karen Pierce, the British ambassador to the United States, also attended the dinner.\n\nCameron\u2019s visit came days before the former UK Prime Minister met with Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Washington to discuss the US sending more aid to Ukraine. A spokesperson for the British government called Cameron\u2019s meeting with Trump \u201cstandard practice,\u201d arguing it wasn\u2019t unusual for there to be engagement between ministers and opposition candidates of partner nations.\n\nTrump, Cameron and Pierce didn\u2019t just talk about military pacts during their Mar-a-Lago gathering. According to a readout of the meeting, the three \u201calso discussed their mutual admiration for the late Queen Elizabeth II.\u201d",

Days earlier, the House of Representatives also adopted the measure.\n\nLate on Tuesday, US Senator Bernie Sanders decried the approval of the supplemental foreign funding bill, calling it a \u201cdark day\u201d for the US Senate. He added that Washington should not fund right-wing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s war on Gaza.\n\n\u201cThe housing in Gaza is destroyed; the infrastructure in Gaza is destroyed; the health care system in Gaza is destroyed; the educational system in Gaza is destroyed. Enough is enough,\u201d Sanders said in a statement.\n\nThe measure had stalled in Congress for months amid competing political agendas.\n\nSome Republicans have expressed growing scepticism about sending more taxpayer dollars to Ukraine as the Russian invasion of the country grinds on more than two years after it began. But Democrats insisted on passing the bill to provide foreign aid to Ukraine and Israel together.\n\nOn Wednesday, Biden stressed the importance of the new law and its implications for the battlefield in Ukraine, where Russian forces have made some gains in recent months.\n\n\u201cNow, Americans are going to send Ukraine the supplies they need to keep them in the fight,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nThe law allocates $61bn for Ukraine. It also sets aside $9bn for humanitarian assistance around the world, some of which can go to Gaza.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to immediately secure that aid and surge it, including food, medical supplies, clean water,\u201d Biden said. \u201cAnd Israel must make sure all this aid reaches the Palestinians in Gaza without delay.\u201d\n\nIsrael has been imposing a siege in Gaza, severely restricting the entry of food and other vital supplies, bringing the territory of more than 2 million people to the verge of famine.\n\nIn a statement on April 4, Biden rebuked Israel, suggesting that Washington would reconsider its support for the offensive in Gaza if the Israeli government does not allow more aid and take steps to protect civilians in the territory.\n\nSince then, Israel has pushed on with its blockade and intensified its attacks on Gaza. This week, more than 300 bodies were discovered in mass graves near the Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, where the Israeli army had recently conducted an operation.\n\nBut the Biden administration has muted its criticism of Israel as tensions between the US ally and Iran intensified in recent weeks. Instead, Washington has repeatedly asserted that its support of Israel remains \u201cironclad\u201d.\n\nIran had launched hundreds of drones and missiles against Israel on April 13 in retaliation for a deadly Israeli air raid against Tehran\u2019s consulate in Damascus. Pentagon officials say that US forces in the region helped Israel shoot down most of the Iranian projectiles.\n\nOn Wednesday, Biden stressed US support for Israel against Iran. \u201cI will always make sure that Israel has what it needs to defend itself against Iran and terrorists it supports,\u201d he said.",

        "text": "The Money and Economics Behind The Presidential Election \u2013 Michigan Journal of Economics\nWritten by Tianqi (George) Sun\n\nThe presidential election of 2024 is coming up. No matter which political party people associate with, there is one undeniable truth: running for president costs billions of dollars. With these contributions, challenges arise, and significant debates around the influence of money on elections have arisen. Campaign financing includes terms such as \u201cdark money,\u201d \u201csoft money,\u201d and \u201chard money\u201d to categorize the sources and regulations around these funds\u200b.\n\nDark money refers to the money donated by wealthy individuals to influence the election and public policy. These funds are usually undisclosed because they are passed through from a non-profit organization (FEC.gov.). The politicians are only required to display the name of the non-profit organization instead of the specific donations. Soft money refers to the donation to a specific political party rather than a specific candidate; this means it is outside of the Federal Election Commission (FEC limitations). These funds are highly unregulated and are known as \u201cnon federal\u201d contributions. In comparison, hard money represents the funds that came only from an individual or a political action committee. This money is highly regulated and monitored by the FEC and is subject to federal limits (FEC.gov.). These different types of money have created trouble for the FEC to regulate, and over the years, different legislations have been put in place for regulation, but some also have been changed. As more and more funds are required to run for a presidential election, the power of money in politics has been a topic that is more important than ever for people to discuss.\n\nThe presidential election fund has risen significantly over the past decades. In the 2022 election, a total of 16.7 billion dollars was spent on campaigning from the candidates (Giorno). Some people have concerns about the influence of the donation money. It is widely believed that companies and people who donate to the presidential campaign will have an easier time getting contracts from the federal government. Also, the candidate will make more time and meetings with those who have donated and might potentially pass legislatures and policies to help the individual who has donated. For instance, George Soros donated 140 million dollars to political causes in 2021 just before midterm elections, making him the lead donor of the midterm election (Schwartzb).\n\nHowever, some argue that the spending and funding does not correlate with the victory of the candidate. Funding does play a larger role running for state-level and other sub-level elections, but less so for presidential elections. Though funding is important, it is only for publicity and competitiveness; in the end, the candidates themselves need to carry out their message to the public in order to secure an electoral victory.\n\nTo go into more regulations about the presidential election, people call for regulations to be put on large election donors to prevent corruption and increase trust in the government. The government needs to be an entity that makes economic decisions that are beneficial to the country and the people instead of profiting specific individuals. Over time since the 20th century, legislation has been put in place to combat this distrust and regulate the election. The Tillman Act of 1907, which prohibited corporate contributions to federal candidates, and the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) of 1971, amended post-Watergate to establish a comprehensive system of regulation and enforcement, including public financing of presidential campaigns and the creation of the Federal Election Commission (FEC) (The Free Speech Center).\n\nThere has also been a counteractive force to the regulation. The supreme court\u2019s decision in Buckley v. Valeo (1976) and subsequent rulings like Citizens United v. FEC have significantly impacted campaign finance laws by striking down spending limits as unconstitutional violations of free speech, thereby removing some limits on campaign expenditures unless candidates accept public financing (Buckley).\n\nTo further build a fair election environment, and as time progresses, the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), also known as the McCain-Feingold bill, aimed to address some of these issues by eliminating soft money donations to national party committees and setting limits on \u201celectioneering communications (Legal Information Institute).\u201d However, its effectiveness has been mixed, with continued debates over the influence of money in politics and calls for further reforms.\n\nThe influence of money on the election has been tremendous. There is a persistent tension between free speech and political contributions. The FEC\u2019s role in enforcing federal campaign finance laws and providing transparency is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the presidential campaign finance process\u200b. As time progresses, the regulations will most likely adjust to ensure a more comprehensive system for election to make the process as transparent as possible.\n\nReferences\n\nBuckley v. Valeo.

When the final count is in, a third-party candidate captures 41 percent of the electorate. Trump finishes just behind that candidate, at 39 percent, with Biden a distant third. The first third-party candidate to seize an electoral vote since segregationist George Wallace in 1968 would effectively prevent either major-party candidate from becoming president. What happens then?\n\nMost Americans, for good reason, have no idea. The last time we had to ask was in 1824, when John Quincy Adams and Andrew Jackson vied for the presidency. The answer is something called a \u201ccontingent election\u201d \u2014 a process where the House of Representatives chooses the president. That may sound great to Republicans, since their party currently controls the House, but it isn\u2019t that simple. At a time when American democracy is fraying, with just 16 percent saying they trusted the government in 2023, a contingent election could be the poison pill embedded in the U.S. Constitution that causes the rest of the electoral system to fail.\n\nThomas Jefferson feared a constitutional crisis if no presidential candidate received an electoral majority. | Photo by VCG Wilson / Corbis via Getty Images\n\nPerhaps the third-party candidate is independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has consistently polled in double figures nationwide, or unlikely spoilers Jill Stein or Cornel West. It could have been a contender tapped by centrist political organization No Labels, which had floated names like Joe Manchin, Nikki Haley and former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr. to oppose the deeply unpopular Trump and Biden, before it decided not to field a candidate after all. And perhaps the necessary electoral votes would come from Utah, where voters have shown an appetite for third-party candidates before; Evan McMullin and Ross Perot each garnered more than 20 percent in 2016 and 1992, respectively. But it\u2019s not just Utah. A contingent election can be triggered by any third-party candidate earning a handful of electoral votes in any state.\n\nRight now, this doesn\u2019t seem likely. But it\u2019s true that many Americans don\u2019t like either major-party option. Combined with Biden\u2019s age and Trump\u2019s courtship of chaos, you\u2019re left with wild cards that could still open new doors for third-party candidates in the coming months. \u201cThe odds,\u201d says Kevin Kosar, a senior fellow studying Congress at the American Enterprise Institute, \u201care not insignificant.\u201d And just one election removed from a similar loophole leading to bloodshed on January 6, 2021, this forgotten snag in the Constitution could pose a serious problem \u2014 one the author of the Declaration of Independence recognized as an existential threat to the system he helped create.\n\nThomas Jefferson wrote that the contingent election system is \u201cthe most dangerous blot in our constitution, and one which some unlucky chance will some day hit.\u201d\n\nMany features of the U.S. Constitution have endured the centuries for good reason. But the contingent election process has lasted as a matter of convenience and compromise more than inherent virtue.\n\nDelegates to the 1787 Constitutional Convention struggled for many months to decide how to elect the president. For a long time, they thought the best idea was to have Congress choose. But that arrangement, they decided, would create conditions for corruption between the legislative and executive branches of government. They wanted something that would keep the branches more separate, but they couldn\u2019t decide whether the president should be chosen on the basis of proportional representation, like the House of Representatives, or an equal say between the states, like the Senate. To resolve the question, a committee proposed what we know as the Electoral College, which distributes votes for president in a roughly proportional way. However, that system only found widespread support thanks to another, lesser-known compromise.\n\nThis compromise addressed what to do if the Electoral College failed to produce any candidate with an electoral majority. In that case, the election would go to the House, where every state delegation, rather than each individual member, would receive one vote for president \u2014 the contingent election system.\n\nIt sounds pretty foreign today \u2014 the Electoral College hasn\u2019t failed to produce a winner in 200 years \u2014 but at the time, before the two-party system formed, the contingent election system, as an option, was important. Without two main candidates running against each other, there could be too much competition, the thinking went, for any candidate to secure an electoral majority. George Mason, father of the Constitution\u2019s Bill of Rights, predicted that 19 of every 20 presidential elections would be decided by the contingent election process. \u201cMany of the framers thought this would be the normal thing that would happen,\u201d says Alex Keyssar, a Harvard election historian. \u201cThey thought that the Electoral College would be a sort of nominating board.\u201d Sure enough, that\u2019s how it went in the election of 1800.\n\nThomas Jefferson would eventually prevail over Aaron Burr thanks to the contingent election process. And by the next election, legislators had ratified the 12th Amendment, paving the way for the formation of the modern two-party system. \u201cThat shifted the terrain,\u201d Keyssar says, \u201cmaking it somewhat less likely \u2014 or maybe significantly less likely, over time, that it would go to a contingent election.\u201d But the contingent election system remained in place, lurking in the constitutional shadows, ripening as an agent of chaos. Jefferson himself, despite becoming president via the method, wrote in 1823 that the contingent election system is \u201cthe most dangerous blot in our constitution, and one which some unlucky chance will some day hit.\u201d\n\nA single year later, his concerns rippled across the nation.\n\n\u201cMany of the framers thought this would be the normal thing that would happen. They thought that the Electoral College would be a sort of nominating board.\u201d \u2014Alex Keyssar, a Harvard historian\n\nThe election of 1824 produced the kind of outcome many of the founders foresaw: The Federalist Party had collapsed, leaving members of the Democratic-Republican Party as the only major players in national politics. With substantial disagreement and factioning within the party, and without the strict nominating procedures of today, four Democratic-Republicans competed to become president.\n\nWith 131 electoral votes required to win the Electoral College, Gen. Andrew Jackson led the way with 99, while Secretary of State John Quincy Adams trailed just behind with 84. Treasury Secretary William H. Crawford and Speaker of the House Henry Clay finished a distant third and fourth, respectively \u2014 but they captured enough electoral votes to trigger a contingent election. Few thought much of it at the beginning. \u201cBut there was a lot of electoral maneuvering going on,\u201d Keyssar says. Especially by Clay, who held enormous sway in the House. He strong-armed many fellow legislators into supporting Adams, who prevailed in the contingent process and became president despite losing the popular vote to Jackson by a considerable margin. Adams, in turn, made Clay his secretary of state.\n\nJackson was furious. He told swelling crowds that Clay and Adams had made a \u201ccorrupt bargain\u201d to keep him out of the White House. He spent the next three years building support across the nation with a populist message that used the flaws of the contingent election to his advantage: The federal government was corrupt, he argued \u2014 in the political language of today, one might say \u201crigged\u201d \u2014 and his loss was proof. Clay and Adams\u2019 quid pro quo has never been proven definitively, but Jackson\u2019s commonsense message resonated anyway. He\u2019d won the popular vote; he\u2019d won the most electoral votes; and he\u2019d been denied the presidency. It didn\u2019t make sense, he proclaimed, even if the proper procedure had been followed. Americans seemed to agree. In 1828, he crushed Adams in a rematch.\n\nJon Krause for the Deseret News\n\n\u201cThereafter,\u201d Keyssar says, \u201cyou got a more-or-less durable two-party system.\u201d Which means the contingent election hasn\u2019t been needed again, though there have been some close calls. In 1948, \u201cDixiecrat\u201d Strom Thurmond secured 39 electoral votes across five states, but Democrat Harry Truman\u2019s margin of victory over Republican Thomas Dewey was large enough that it didn\u2019t matter. Twenty years later, Wallace garnered 46 electoral votes, but Richard Nixon crushed Democratic challenger Hubert Humphrey; once more, it didn\u2019t matter.\n\nThen, in 1992, early polls showed independent challenger Ross Perot courting somewhere between 25 and 40 percent of the vote in a three-way matchup with Democrat Bill Clinton and incumbent George H.W. Bush. Those numbers revived high-level, bipartisan conversations about the contingent election process. The Republican House minority leader said it would be an \u201cutter disaster,\u201d while Kansas Democrat Dan Glickman called it a \u201crecipe for, at minimum, chaos, and at a maximum, disaster.\u201d The House set up a committee to study what members would actually have to do if a contingent election occurred, while the Senate met to discuss electoral reform. Once again, Democrats and Republicans agreed that the contingent process made no sense; they just couldn\u2019t agree what to do about it.\n\nDemocrats wanted to shift from the Electoral College to a popular vote, while Republicans wanted to keep the Electoral College but replace the contingent process with a runoff election. The latter effort was led by a relatively young senator from Kentucky, Mitch McConnell. \u201cIt is nonsense,\u201d he admitted then, \u201cto have the House of Representatives choose the president.\u201d\n\nBy then, Perot had dropped out. The official reason he gave was his desire to avoid a contingent election. He called the possibility \u201cdisruptive.\u201d Whether that was the real reason or not, he recognized the risk of opening up this constitutional loophole. All three candidates did. But nothing was ever done. \u201cThe end of Ross Perot\u2019s third-party candidacy did absolutely nothing to solve the problems inherent in our electoral process,\u201d Arkansas Democratic Sen. David Pryor told the hearing 32 years ago. \u201cIt just pushed off the final day of reckoning.\u201d\n\nIn 1992, Democrats and Republicans agreed that the contingent process made no sense; they just couldn\u2019t agree what to do about it.\n\nMost Americans remember the violence of January 6, 2021, but fewer remember what caused it. The turmoil of that day began with something called the Electoral Count Act of 1887. The law was supposed to clarify how some parts of the Electoral College should work, but it also left some things ambiguous. Namely, the role of the vice president in presiding over the counting of the votes, and whether the office has the authority to reject certain electors if they\u2019re suspected of fraud or illegitimacy.\n\nThat\u2019s the argument Trump made, asserting that he could be triumphant if only Vice President Mike Pence had the courage. Pence didn\u2019t see it that way. The vice president\u2019s role has always been a functionally ceremonial one, and that\u2019s how he approached it. For Kosar, the American Enterprise Institute scholar, the fact that the statute left room for such varying interpretations was always cause for concern. \u201cYou saw these very clever lawyer folks and partisan politicos reading this statute in such a way that it would produce the result that they wanted,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was distressing. \u2026 And with the Electoral Count Act, at least we had a statute to work with.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the procedures of a contingent election have not been clarified via statute over the centuries; we\u2019d be relying on the language of the Constitution alone. And to throw in another wrinkle, the legislators making the decisions would be the incoming Congress, not the current Congress. With that in mind, let\u2019s consider another real possibility.\n\nImagine that, in addition to some third-party candidate securing enough electoral votes to cause a contingent election, Democrats manage to win back a House majority \u2014 a very possible outcome. Even if that happened, Democrats wouldn\u2019t necessarily be able to choose the president. Remember, the vote is by state delegations, not sheer numbers; Democrats could control the House overall, but Republicans could still hold more state delegations. Would that make a second term of Trump imminent?\n\nNo, it turns out. The Constitution says nothing about how a contingent election has to proceed, empowering the House majority to make whatever rules it wants. In this scenario, House Democrats could create rules that would effectively block Republican delegations from voting for Trump, or for anyone. Barring some party flip-flopping, this scenario would most likely result in a stalemate.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. sees a contingent election as one possible path to the White House in his third-party bid for the presidency. | Photo by Mario Tama / Getty Images\n\nThe Constitution says that in such a situation, the presidential line of succession should be followed, meaning that the vice president would become president. But picking the vice president would fall to the Senate, where a filibuster-proof 60-vote majority would be required. Neither party is expected to have that, which could mean another stalemate. Following the presidential line of succession, the speaker of the House would become president. But the speaker\u2019s term ends when Congress does, so there would be no speaker of the House when these decisions are being made. In that case, the president pro tempore of the Senate would ascend to the presidency. \u201cIt started really upsetting me the more I thought about it,\u201d Kosar says. \u201cWhat if the Senate pro tem decides that she wants to be the president, and therefore tries to gum up the works? \u2026 It gets to be a real mess.\u201d\n\nThat could be bad, given that few Americans can even name the Senate\u2019s president pro tempore (Democrat Patty Murray of Washington). But consider this: The Senate could also invoke the \u201cnuclear option,\u201d which would drop the vote threshold for vice president to 50. If the Senate were equally divided along party lines as it is now \u2014 another real possibility \u2014 Vice President Kamala Harris could cast a deciding vote making herself president.\n\nContemplate, for a moment, how relatively benign the election fraud conspiracies of 2020 seem compared to a Democratic vice president voting to elect herself president.\n\nThat\u2019s just one long-shot scenario, but it illustrates a much bigger problem. The contingent election process would introduce unparalleled levels of uncertainty, with both Republicans and Democrats highly motivated to use every obscure parliamentary trick at their disposal to keep the opposing party out of the White House. \u201cThere\u2019s all these really perverse incentives,\u201d says Beau Tremitiere, a lawyer with the nonprofit Protect Democracy who has studied contingent elections extensively. \u201cIt\u2019s just a really dangerously open field with very little guidance, being handed to a Congress that has barely been able to keep the lights on, let alone do something this momentous.\u201d And that\u2019s at a time when the legitimacy of elections is already imperiled thanks to Trump\u2019s lies about the 2020 results. \u201cWe\u2019re already struggling to ensure the legitimacy of the upcoming election,\u201d says Lee Drutman, a political scholar with the New America think tank who studies democratic representation. \u201cTo throw it into a procedure that is unfamiliar and confusing to many voters, probably 99.8 percent of voters, is just incredibly dangerous.\u201d\n\nMoreover, whatever Congress does, a contingent election assures a crisis of legitimacy. A president chosen by partisan horse trading and closed-doors bargaining is not going to have much of a mandate to rule \u2014 especially if Congress ends up choosing whichever candidate receives less of the popular or electoral vote. \u201cEven when (the contingent election process) has been used, it has generated a tremendous sense of illegitimacy,\u201d Drutman says. \u201cAnd when elections are not seen as legitimate, it creates tremendous political problems.\u201d\n\nIf the Senate were equally divided along partisan lines, Kamala Harris could cast a deciding vote making herself president.\n\nAs unlikely as a contingent election might seem in the context of America\u2019s rigid two-party history, Kennedy\u2019s campaign is well aware of it. His team views the contingent election process as a viable path to the presidency, and so did No Labels before it backed out.\n\nIn December, No Labels chief strategist Ryan Clancy told a group of reporters that if his group\u2019s nominee managed to secure enough electoral votes to trigger a contingent election, it could have used those votes as a bargaining chip to form some kind of \u201ccoalition government,\u201d becoming a power broker to swing the election one way or the other. That wasn\u2019t the plan, he said, but they\u2019d thought about it. In an interview with NBC News, a No Labels co-founder added that the group had already \u201cmapped out\u201d which states might side with them in a contingent election. \u201cThe point is,\u201d he added, \u201cthe Constitution allows for that kind of potential.\u201d\n\nIs that healthy for a democracy that\u2019s already imperiled? No Labels thought so: More choices and more voices represented in the electoral process enhances democracy. That\u2019s one way to think about it. Another came from a bipartisan group of former lawmakers, who in early February sent a letter to No Labels to address its apparent courtship of a contingent election. \u201cEven if No Labels could mount the most successful third-party presidential campaign in U.S. history and shatter all outside expectations, a split Electoral College is, by far, the most likely outcome. Any suggestion to the contrary is fantasy,\u201d the group, composed of five Republicans and six Democrats, including former Colorado Congressmen David Skaggs and Tim Wirth, wrote. \u201cA contingent election,\u201d they added, \u201cwould be calamitous.\u201d\n\nKennedy has telegraphed the same intentions. In December, the founder of his political action committee, Tony Lyons, said in a statement to Politico that he was confident Kennedy could win a contingent election. \u201cKennedy has two clear pathways to the White House,\u201d he added. A statement to Deseret Magazine from Kennedy\u2019s campaign manager, Amaryllis Kennedy, emphasized the same philosophy: He wants to win outright \u2014 but a contingent election would be welcome, too. \u201cWhile we have reason to believe a contingent election would go RFK\u2019s way,\u201d she wrote, \u201cwe intend to win the White House with 270-plus electoral votes and the unified support of Americans across the political spectrum.\u201d\n\nThird-party candidate Ross Perot, center, helped thwart the most recent potential contingent election, in 1992, by dropping out of the race. | Photo by J. David Ake / AFP via Getty Images\n\nCampaign bluster aside, such an outcome is very unlikely. Tremitiere offers another historical example: Teddy Roosevelt\u2019s 1912 run for president on the \u201cBull Moose\u201d party ticket. At the time, Roosevelt was a very popular ex-president. He enjoyed far more recognition and credibility than Kennedy or anyone No Labels could have hoped to nominate. But he lost to Democrat Woodrow Wilson by 347 electoral votes. \u201cThe historical track record here is really stacked against anyone trying to run as a third-party option,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s hard to see how someone today would fare differently.\u201d At their best and most influential, then, the most Kennedy and future groups like No Labels could reasonably hope to accomplish is trigger a contingent election. For the health of democracy, Tremitiere says, that\u2019s far worse than not running at all.\n\nIn the abstract, most Republicans and Democrats can probably agree that a contingent election is a pretty bad way to choose the president. Whether the solution is the McConnell-proposed runoff election, the popular vote alternative floated by his Democratic contemporaries of 30 years ago, or something else, the current system isn\u2019t something anyone today would build from scratch. So why hasn\u2019t anything been done to fix it?\n\nOne explanation: \u201cLegislators have way too much to do, and the other things they feel like they need to do are far more pressing,\u201d Kosar says. And even if Congress did, somehow, recognize the disastrous potential of a contingent election and work to address it before it happens, it\u2019s probably too late for such action in 2024. Paranoia, Kosar says, would pervade negotiations, with both sides worried that their political opponents would be working to game the reform to their benefit. \u201cSo yeah,\u201d he adds, \u201cit\u2019s a problem.\u201d\n\nThere are some reasons to be hopeful, says Audrey Perry, an adjunct professor of election law at Brigham Young University. \u201cWe\u2019ve survived this long,\u201d she says. \u201cI would hope that we could survive this as well. \u2026 I would hope that this could proceed, if not in a clean manner, at least in a nonviolent manner.\u201d Nobody really knows how a contingent election would unfold, and maybe a system that has endured for several centuries could endure this \u201cblot,\u201d too. But we also exist at a time when the digital world has placed what New Yorker writer Jay Caspian Kang calls a \u201cfilter of unreality\u201d between all of us, leading to widespread, long-simmering polarization and a cross-partisan feeling among nearly 7 in 10 Americans that the country is on the wrong track. Add a presidential candidate who has made election denialism and provocation a cornerstone of his appeal, and we could be at a culmination point \u2014 one where all it takes is one big shock to the system for the whole thing to collapse.\n\nWill \u201cthe most dangerous blot in our Constitution\u201d prove to be as fatal as Jefferson feared? Better yet, maybe time can become the ally of American democracy. Maybe the best we can hope for, when it comes to contingent elections, is that the 200-year streak of avoiding them remains unbroken; that the day of reckoning doesn\u2019t come any time soon.\n\nThis story appears in the May 2024 issue of Deseret Magazine.

        "text": "Supreme Court seems skeptical of Donald Trump's claim of absolute immunity\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Supreme Court on Thursday appeared likely to reject former President Donald Trump\u2019s claim of absolute immunity from prosecution over election interference, but several justices signaled reservations about the charges that could cause a lengthy delay, possibly beyond November\u2019s election.\n\nA majority of the justices did not appear to embrace the claim of absolute immunity that would stop special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s prosecution of Trump on charges he conspired to overturn his 2020 election loss to Democrat Joe Biden. But in arguments lasting more than 2 1/2 hours in the court\u2019s first consideration of criminal charges against a former president, several conservative justices indicated they could limit when former presidents might be prosecuted, suggesting that the case might have to be sent back to lower courts before any trial could begin.\n\nJustice Samuel Alito said that \u201cwhatever we decide is going to apply to all future presidents.\u201d\n\nThe timing of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision could be as important as the outcome. Trump, the presumptive 2024 Republican presidential nominee, has been pushing to delay the trial until after the election, and the later the justices issue their decision, the more likely he is to succeed. If Trump regains the presidency, he could order the Justice Department to dismiss the case or, as two justices suggested, pardon himself if convicted.\n\nWhat to know about Trump\u2019s second term:\n\nStaffing the administration: Here are the people Trump has picked recess appointments Follow all of our coverage as Donald Trump assembles his second administration.\n\nSince conservatives on the court gained a supermajority with the confirmation of three Trump appointees, they have cast aside decades-old precedent on abortion and affirmation action. Now Trump is asking them to rule that one of the fundamental tenets of the American system of government \u2014 that no person is above the law -- should be rejected as well, at least as it applies to him.\n\nThe active questioning of all nine justices left the strong impression that the court was not headed for the sort of speedy, consensus decision that would allow a trial to begin quickly.\n\nAP AUDIO: Supreme Court seems skeptical of Trump\u2019s claim of absolute immunity, but decision\u2019s timing is unclear. AP correspondent Jackie Quinn reports the U.S. Supreme Court has finished hearing arguments on whether Donald Trump is immune from prosecution for alleged crimes while still in office.\n\nJustices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, two of Trump\u2019s three high court appointees, and Alito said their concern was not the case against Trump, but rather the effect of their ruling on future presidencies.\n\nEach time Justice Department lawyer Michael Dreeben sought to focus on Trump\u2019s actions, these justices jumped in. \u201cThis case has huge implications for the presidency, for the future of the presidency, for the future of the country,\u201d Kavanaugh said. The court is writing a decision \u201cfor the ages,\u201d Gorsuch said.\n\nJustice Amy Coney Barrett, the other Trump appointee, seemed less open to arguments advanced by Trump lawyer D. John Sauer, searching for a way a trial could take place.\n\nSmith\u2019s team is asking for a speedy resolution. The court typically issues its last opinions by the end of June, about four months before the election. U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan, who would preside over the trial, said pre-trial issues could take up to three months.\n\nThe court has moved very quickly in prior cases involving presidential power, deciding the Watergate tapes case against President Richard Nixon just 16 days after arguments. Earlier this year, it took the justices less than a month to rule unanimously that states couldn\u2019t kick Trump off the ballot.\n\nTrump, the first former president charged with crimes, had said he wanted to be at the Supreme Court on Thursday. Instead, he was in a courtroom in New York, where he is standing trial on charges that he falsified business records to keep damaging information from voters when he directed hush money payments to a former porn star to keep quiet her claims that they had a sexual encounter.\n\nSauer argued that former presidents are entitled to absolute immunity for their official acts. Otherwise, he said, politically motivated prosecutions of former occupants of the Oval Office would become routine and presidents couldn\u2019t function as the commander in chief if they had to worry about criminal charges.\n\nAP AUDIO: No one is above the law. Supreme Court will decide if that includes Trump while he was president. AP Supreme Court writer Mark Sherman reports the court is going to decide if former President Trump can be tried for his actions following the last presidential election.\n\nLower courts have rejected those arguments, including a unanimous three-judge panel on an appeals court in Washington, D.C.\n\nSeveral justices drilled down on trying to come up with a definition of what constituted an official act, and whether charges based on one should be thrown out.\n\nJustice Elena Kagan at one pointed wondered whether a former president could escape prosecution even if he ordered a coup or sold nuclear secrets. Sauer said prosecutions might not be allowed if those were determined to be official acts.\n\n\u201cThat sure sounds bad, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Kagan asked.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts conjured up a president being indicted for receiving a bribe in exchange for an ambassadorial appointment. How could the indictment go forward if prosecutors had to remove the official act, the appointment? \u201cThat\u2019s like a one-legged stool, right?\u201d Roberts asked.\n\nThe election interference conspiracy case brought by Smith in Washington is just one of four criminal cases confronting Trump. Smith was in the courtroom Thursday, seated at the table for lawyers taking part in the case.\n\nSmith\u2019s team says the men who wrote Constitution never intended for presidents to be above the law and that, in any event, the acts Trump is charged with \u2014 including participating in a scheme to enlist fake electors in battleground states won by Biden \u2014 aren\u2019t in any way part of a president\u2019s official duties. Dreeben said that even if some of the acts are considered part of the president\u2019s powers, like talking to Justice Department officials, they still should be kept in the indictment.\n\nTrump\u2019s conversations with then-Vice President Mike Pence, urging him to reject some electoral votes on Jan. 6, 2021, might also fall under official acts.\n\nBarrett asked Dreeben whether Smith\u2019s team could \u201cjust proceed based on the private conduct and drop the official conduct.\u201d Dreeben said that might be possible, especially if prosecutors could, for example, use the conversations with Justice Department officials and Pence to make their case.\n\nNearly four years ago, all nine justices rejected Trump\u2019s claim of absolute immunity from a district attorney\u2019s subpoena for his financial records. That case played out during Trump\u2019s presidency and involved a criminal investigation, but no charges.\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas, who would have prevented the enforcement of the subpoena because of Trump\u2019s responsibilities as president, still rejected Trump\u2019s claim of absolute immunity and pointed to the text of the Constitution and how it was understood by the people who ratified it.\n\n\u201cThe text of the Constitution \u2026 does not afford the President absolute immunity,\u201d Thomas wrote in 2020.\n\nCommentators had speculated about why the court took up the case in the first place.\n\nPhillip Bobbitt, a constitutional scholar at Columbia University\u2019s law school, said he worries about the delay, but sees value in a decision that amounts to \u201ca definitive expression by the Supreme Court that we are a government of laws and not of men.\u201d\n\nThe court also may be more concerned with how its decision could affect future presidencies, Harvard law school professor Jack Goldsmith wrote on the Lawfare blog.\n\nBut Kermit Roosevelt, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania, said the court never should have taken the case because an ideologically diverse panel of the federal appeals court in Washington adequately addressed the issues.\n\n\u201cIf it was going to take the case, it should have proceeded faster, because now, it will most likely prevent the trial from being completed before the election,\u201d Roosevelt said. \u201cEven Richard Nixon said that the American people deserve to know whether their president is a crook. The Supreme Court seems to disagree.\u201d\n\nThe court has several options for deciding the case, though something between a complete win for Trump or prosecutors seemed most likely.\n\nThe court might spell out when former presidents are shielded from prosecution. It could then either declare that Trump\u2019s alleged conduct easily crossed the line or return the case to Chutkan so she can decide whether Trump should have to stand trial.\n\n___\n\nFollow the AP\u2019s coverage of the U.S. Supreme Court at https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court.",

        "text": "Supreme Court hears Trump's 'absolute immunity' claim. The shape of the presidency is at stake.\nThe fate of his federal criminal Jan. 6 trial hinges on the court's decision.\n\nSupreme Court hears Trump's 'absolute immunity' claim. The shape of the presidency is at stake.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of a divisive 2024 presidential campaign, the U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday is taking up the monumental question of whether a former president turned presumptive GOP nominee can be criminally prosecuted for his efforts to stay in power after the last election.\n\nThe case, Donald J. Trump v. United States, presents an unprecedented constitutional quandary for the court brought about by equally unprecedented actions by former President Donald Trump in the aftermath of the 2020 presidential election, which he lost to Joe Biden by a margin of 7 million popular votes.\n\nThe outcome could determine whether Trump faces a federal trial this year on four felony counts pressed by special counsel Jack Smith, including conspiracy to defraud the U.S. and obstruction of an official proceeding, for his attempts to overturn the electoral vote count certifying Biden's victory.\n\nThe Supreme Court of the United States is seen in Washington, Mar. 26, 2024. Amanda Andrade-Rhoades/AP\n\nTrump, who has pleaded not guilty, is seeking to quash the case on the claim that as a former president he enjoys \"absolute immunity\" from criminal prosecution for any \"official acts\" during his tenure. He is the first American president -- current or former -- to ever face criminal charges.\n\n\"The President cannot function, and the Presidency itself cannot retain its vital independence, if the President faces criminal prosecution for official acts once he leaves office,\" Trump's attorneys wrote in their opening brief to the high court.\n\n\"Denial of criminal immunity would incapacitate every future President with de facto blackmail and extortion while in office, and condemn him to years of post-office trauma at the hands of political opponents,\" they argued.\n\nTwo courts have resoundingly rejected the former president's immunity arguments, including a unanimous three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.\n\n\"Former President Trump has become citizen Trump, with all of the defenses of any other criminal defendant,\" the panel wrote. \"Former President Trump lacked any lawful discretionary authority to defy federal criminal law and he is answerable in court for his conduct.\"\n\nThe appeals court warned that if Trump's constitutional theory were accepted, it would \"collapse our system of separated powers\" by putting a president above the law.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court is seen, Apr. 22, 2024, in Washington, DC. Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n\nSmith, the special counsel, argues in his brief to the high court that Trump's assertion lacks any historical precedent and undermines the founders' vision of a presidency restrained in power.\n\n\"The effective functioning of the presidency does not require that a former president be immune from accountability for these alleged violations of federal criminal law,\" the he wrote the justices. \"To the contrary, a bedrock principle of our constitutional order is that no person is above the law -- including the President.\"\n\nA trial date in Smith's federal election case against Trump was initially set for March 4 in U.S. District Court but was delayed awaiting a final decision by the Supreme Court. A ruling on the immunity claim is expected before July, as soon as mid-May.\n\nThe justices could uphold the appeals court decision in its entirety, clearing the way for a trial this summer, or they could take a middle-road approach, spelling out what actions qualify for immunity and which do not, sending the case back to lower courts for further proceedings. Such an outcome could rule out a trial before the November election.\n\nMost legal analysts say it's highly unlikely the Supreme Court -- with its conservative majority and three Trump appointees -- will endorse Trump's sweeping assertion of \"absolute immunity.\" In a 2020 decision, the same court rejected a similar immunity claim by Trump in his attempt to reject a grand jury subpoena for his tax returns.\n\nA majority of Americans (51%) think the federal indictment of Trump related to Jan. 6 and his efforts to overturn the 2020 election is very serious, according to an ABC News/Ipsos poll from late last year.\n\nJust over half of respondents -- 52% -- think Trump should have been charged with a crime in this case, while 32% said he should not have been. At the same time, 46% think the charges against Trump are politically motivated, while 40% do not, per the poll conducted using Ipsos' KnowledgePanel.\n\nFormer president Donald Trump speaks to the press during his trial at Manhattan Criminal Court in New York City, Apr. 22, 2024. Angela Weiss/POOL/AFP via Getty Images\n\nTrump's legal team has argued that the impeachment process is the only check on a president's conduct allowed by the Constitution, even as they concede that a president who is impeached, convicted and removed from office could subsequently face criminal prosecution for the same acts.\n\nTrump was impeached by the House in 2021 over his efforts to overturn results of the 2020 election but later acquitted by the Senate after he had left office. The former president argues that his actions were part of a legally legitimate effort to ensure election integrity.\n\nSmith insists former presidents have never been immune from prosecution and have always been aware of the potential for prosecution. He cites in court briefs the case of former President Richard Nixon accepting a pardon from President Gerald Ford as evidence that Nixon believed prosecution was possible after he had resigned.\n\nWhile Supreme Court precedent has limited civil litigation against presidents, the special counsel contends criminal matters are different -- and that there are layers of legal safeguards in the system to prevent partisan harassment and protect due process.\n\n\"Even if liability could not be premised on official acts,\" Smith wrote the justices in his brief, \"the case should be remanded for trial, with the district court to make evidentiary and instructional rulings in accordance with this Court's decision. Petitioner [Trump] could seek appellate review of those rulings, if necessary, following final judgment.\"\n\nAfter oral arguments on Thursday, the justices will vote during their weekly private conference and begin drafting opinions. They are expected to be released before the court's term ends in June.",

        "text": "Biden signs a bill that could ban TikTok \u2014 after the 2024 election\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Tucked inside the sprawling $95 billion national security package that President Joe Biden\u2019s signed Wednesday is a provision that could ban TikTok, with an important catch: It won\u2019t happen before the 2024 election.\n\nThat means TikTok, which boasts 170 million American users, will remain a force throughout the campaign, providing a platform for candidates to reach predominantly younger voters. An earlier version of the bill could have banned the popular video-sharing app prior to the election, but recent changes mean lawmakers and Biden may not face such an immediate voter backlash.\n\nThe new legislation provides nine months for TikTok\u2019s Beijing-based parent company, ByteDance, to sell it or face a nationwide prohibition in the United States. The president can grant a one-time extension of 90 days, bringing the timeline to sell to one year, if he certifies that there\u2019s a path to divestiture and \u201csignificant progress\u201d toward executing it.\n\nEven without the extension, the earliest a ban could start is January 2025. With the extension, it would be April. And with TikTok threatening legal action, the matter could get tied up in the courts for even longer. It\u2019s a shift from an earlier House-passed bill that included a six-month window that could have triggered a TikTok ban before the November election.\n\nA senior Republican aide said Democrats were responsible for the change. \u201cSenate Democrats had been pretty consistent about wanting to extend that timeline,\u201d the aide said.\n\nThe election was \u201cdefinitely\u201d something \u201cconveniently addressed\u201d by the new deadline, said a Democratic source close to the issue.\n\nOther Democrats are assuring voters that ByteDance would sooner sell TikTok than risk a U.S. ban, a view some experts disagree with.\n\n\u201cTikTok ain\u2019t going away. There is no more capitalistic entity than an organization controlled by the Chinese Communist Party. They\u2019re going to sell it,\u201d said Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., a member of the Armed Services Committee, who faces re-election this fall. \u201cYoung people will go on their TikTok tomorrow and they\u2019ll still have it. And then the day after that, they\u2019ll still have it. And the day after that, they\u2019ll still have it,\u201d Kaine said, adding that the only difference is it would be American-owned. \u201cIf you like it, you\u2019re going to keep it.\u201d\n\nIn endorsing the revised TikTok bill, Senate Commerce Committee Chair Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., said that extending ByteDance\u2019s divestment period \u2014 what she called her \u201crecommendation\u201d \u2014 would help ensure there is \u201cenough time for a new buyer to get a deal done.\u201d\n\nOther lawmakers who helped negotiate that change, including Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., agreed that the reason they pushed back the deadline was to improve the chances of a sale.\n\n\u201cThis gives more time to make the divestment achievable,\u201d said Krishnamoorthi, the top Democrat on the special committee investigating the CCP. \u201cIt made a lot of sense. That\u2019s why, as you could tell, we didn\u2019t lose any votes because of the change. In fact, we gained some votes \u2014 we went from 352 to 360 votes in the House.\u201d\n\nTikTok gave no indication that it would consider divesting, with a spokesperson saying in a statement: \u201cThis unconstitutional law is a TikTok ban, and we will challenge it in court.\u201d\n\nTrump, who tried his own ban, tells 'the young people' to blame Biden\n\nDonald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, sought to exploit a ban politically.\n\n\u201cJust so everyone knows, especially the young people, Crooked Joe Biden is responsible for banning TikTok,\u201d Trump said on social media. \u201cHe is the one pushing it to close \u2026 Young people, and lots of others, must remember this on November 5th, ELECTION DAY, when they vote!\u201d\n\nIt's a flip-flop for the former president, who signed an executive order in August 2020 to ban TikTok in 45 days if it was not sold. His statement cited \u201cthe threat posed\u201d by China with its ability under Chinese law to force the app to grant access to Americans\u2019 data and its potential to manipulate the algorithm to advance Chinese propaganda \u2014 the same reasons Congress and Biden favor a ban.\n\nBut the executive order was blocked in court, and the app persisted.\n\n\u201cI have every expectation that TikTok will be alive and well, no matter who is president,\u201d said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn. \u201cDonald Trump is obviously trying to turn it into an election issue, but considering he was in favor of banning it, I think his warning is more baloney to use a polite word.\u201d\n\nSen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said opinions about TikTok and social media won\u2019t \u201crival choice and democracy and immigration as a voting issue\u201d in the 2024 election.\n\nBut Murphy said the political implications cut both ways.\n\n\u201cI am part of a group of pissed-off parents that feel that they\u2019ve lost control of their kids\u2019 lives. There\u2019s undoubtedly another group of kids who are worried that they\u2019re going to lose access to social media in the way that they have it now,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cBut those are two very distinct voting groups and if you ignore the perils of social media, maybe you pick up some younger voters, but you lose some parents. So this is one of these issues where you have to see the full picture.\u201d\n\nRep. Summer Lee, D-Pa., who voted against the TikTok ban over the weekend, said in an interview that there is a need to solve the national security and data concerns associated with the platform but added that banning TikTok would be disastrous for creators, organizers and activists.\n\n\u201cI think this is a case of throwing the baby out with the bathwater, where we have people, communities that are able to organize, that are able to meet, that are able to find space for their businesses to grow\" on TikTok, she said. \u201cWe need to actually think about what the consequences of that are, not political consequences alone, but the consequences holistically.\u201d\n\n'The battle lines aren't really clear'\n\nA Republican working on Senate races said being tough on TikTok would have been an easier message to drive home in the campaign before Trump himself came out against the ban.\n\n\u201cIt used to be a lot more straightforward,\u201d this person said of how they could message against Democrats who use TikTok to campaign \u2014 which, despite Biden's intention to sign the ban legislation, includes his campaign. \u201cBut Trump is on the other side now. It makes the whole thing a little murkier. The battle lines aren\u2019t really clear.\u201d\n\nStill, the Republican believes that a looming ban could have a big impact on the campaign trail for Democrats who use TikTok, saying candidates are using it exclusively as a tool to reach voters.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really clear they think it\u2019s an important tool in their toolbox,\u201d this person said.\n\nIn front-line battleground Senate states, Democratic Sens. Sherrod Brown, of Ohio, and Bob Casey, of Pennsylvania, have accounts on the platform. So, too, do Democratic Reps. Ruben Gallego, of Arizona, and Colin Allred, of Texas, both running for Senate seats in competitive races this fall. All four voted in favor of the legislation that included the potential TikTok ban.\n\nSpeaking with the Rev. Al Sharpton on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cPoliticsNation\u201d on Sunday, Casey expressed hope the legislation would spur TikTok\u2019s parent company to sell its American assets to a U.S. owner.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think any American wants to put our country further at risk when it comes to China,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI know a lot of Americans rely upon TikTok, and that\u2019s understandable because of the value that it can provide to a small-business owner or others who need TikTok to communicate.\"\n\nBrown\u2019s campaign declined to comment. Campaigns for Gallego and Allred did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nBiden's campaign said only that the campaign is on TikTok, without saying whether it would remain on it, and noted that the president doesn't have an official account on the platform.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., asked late Tuesday about a potential backlash to the TikTok crackdown, said: \u201cSpeaker Johnson put it in bill \u2014 the big supplemental bill. We had to get the supplemental bill passed as quickly as possible.\u201d\n\nSome of Biden's allies disagree with him on a TikTok prohibition.\n\nProgressive Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., a Biden campaign surrogate, said he opposes a TikTok ban, citing free speech rights.\n\n\u201cThe longer timeline helps marginally in pushing the ban until after the election and the bill, in any case, is likely to get struck down by the courts,\u201d he said. \u201cBut rushing to pass it shows the complete disconnect between the Beltway establishment and many Americans.\u201d\n\nSen.

        "text": "Biden-Harris Administration Announces Preliminary Terms with Micron to Onshore Leading-Edge Memory Chip Production in U.S. for First Time in Decades\nU.S. Department of Commerce Proposes up to Roughly $6.14 Billion for Micron to Expand Domestic DRAM Chip Production in Idaho and New York\n\nMicron\u2019s Full Vision Would Create Approximately 20,000 Jobs and Catalyze up to $125 Billion in Private Capital Over Two Decades, Including Commitments of $50 Billion in Capex Over Next Six Years\n\nToday, the Biden-Harris Administration announced that the U.S. Department of Commerce and Micron Technology have signed a non-binding preliminary memorandum of terms (PMT) to provide up to roughly $6.14 billion in direct funding under the CHIPS and Science Act to boost U.S. competitiveness in leading-edge memory semiconductor production. The proposed funding would support the construction of two leading-edge Dynamic Random-Access Memory (DRAM) fabs in New York, the first step in Micron\u2019s two-decade vision to invest approximately $100 billion in New York and create roughly 13,500 facility and construction jobs. In addition, the proposed funding would unlock a $25 billion investment in a DRAM fab in Idaho, which will be co-located with Micron\u2019s R&D facilities in Boise and create approximately 6,500 facility and construction jobs. Together, these investments would advance the company\u2019s plans to onshore approximately 40% of their DRAM chip production over the next two decades.\n\n\u201cLeading-edge memory chips are foundational to all advanced technologies, and thanks to President Biden\u2019s leadership, America is rebuilding its capacity to produce these critical capabilities for the first time in almost two decades,\u201d said U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo. \u201cWith this proposed investment, we are working to deliver on one of the core objectives of President Biden\u2019s CHIPS program \u2013 onshoring the development and production of the most advanced memory semiconductor technology which is crucial for safeguarding our leadership on artificial intelligence and protecting our economic and national security. With these proposed investments, coupled with Micron\u2019s historic private investment of up to $125 billion in New York and Idaho over the next 20 years, President Biden is working to revitalize U.S. technological leadership and creating tens of thousands of good-paying jobs.\u201d\n\nMicron is widely recognized as a global leader in leading-edge DRAM technology and production and is the only U.S.-based manufacturer of memory chips. Currently, all leading-edge DRAM chip manufacturing takes place in East Asia, but through this proposed investment in Micron, the Biden-Harris Administration would help strengthen U.S. economic and national security by bolstering a reliable domestic supply of the leading-edge DRAM chips that are important components for advanced technologies, such as wireless communications, personal computing, high-performance compute, automotive, and AI. Micron\u2019s technology will also enable the highest-performance memory, known as High-Bandwidth Memory, which is critical for enabling new AI models. Through its investments in its New York and Idaho fabs, Micron will attract key suppliers to the United States, further strengthening U.S. supply chain resilience.\n\n\"Thanks to President Biden\u2019s historic CHIPS and Science Act, today's announcement is a meaningful step forward in America's leadership in semiconductor development and manufacturing,\" said Deputy Secretary of Commerce Don Graves. \"Micron's investments in New York and Idaho will be crucial to constructing high-volume manufacturing fabs, establishing our country as a global leader in the leading-edge semiconductor market, and helping to write the next chapter of economic prosperity in America.\"\n\n\u201cOur ability to research and develop the next generations of artificial intelligence, wireless communications, and many more advanced technologies depend on leading-edge DRAM chips,\u201d said Under Secretary of Commerce for Standards and Technology and National Institute of Standards and Technology Director Laurie E. Locascio. \u201cThanks to this proposed CHIPS investment, Micron\u2019s leading-edge R&D facility in Boise, Idaho, will develop and produce the most advanced DRAM technology nodes while their planned megafab in New York will produce the chips at high volumes\u2014creating a robust domestic leading-edge memory supply chain that would help make the United States a global leader in memory technology.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a historic moment for semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S.,\u201d said Micron President and CEO Sanjay Mehrotra. \u201cMicron\u2019s leading-edge memory is foundational to meeting the growing demands of artificial intelligence, and we are proud to be making significant memory manufacturing investments in the U.S., which will create many high-tech jobs. We appreciate the foresight of U.S. President Joe Biden, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and the bipartisan delegation in Congress that supported the CHIPS and Science Act. Their steadfast focus championing these strategic investments will ensure U.S. semiconductor competitiveness for generations to come.\u201d\n\nThe proposed CHIPS investment would create a robust leading-edge DRAM chip ecosystem in the United States by supporting projects in Idaho and New York:\n\nClay, New York: Construct first two fabs of planned four fab \u201cmegafab\u201d focused on leading-edge DRAM chip production. Each fab will have 600,000 square feet of cleanrooms, totaling 2.4 million square feet of cleanroom space across the four facilities\u2014the largest amount of cleanroom space ever announced in the United States and the size of nearly 40 football fields.\n\nConstruct first two fabs of planned four fab \u201cmegafab\u201d focused on leading-edge DRAM chip production. Each fab will have 600,000 square feet of cleanrooms, totaling 2.4 million square feet of cleanroom space across the four facilities\u2014the largest amount of cleanroom space ever announced in the United States and the size of nearly 40 football fields. Boise, Idaho: Develop a high-volume manufacturing (HVM) fab, with approximately 600,000 square feet of cleanroom space focused on the production of leading-edge DRAM chips. The fab would be co-located with the company\u2019s R&D facility to improve efficiency across their R&D and manufacturing operations, reducing lags in technology transfer and cutting time-to-market for leading-edge memory products.\n\nMicron is committing to spend $50 billion toward the development of their first three fabs over the next six years, spurring community revitalization and ecosystem development across the country. Over two decades, these projects are expected to create over 9,000 manufacturing and facility jobs and 4,500 construction jobs in New York, and over 2,000 manufacturing and facility jobs and 4,500 construction jobs in Idaho. Micron\u2019s projects will operate under Project Labor Agreements (PLA) in New York and Idaho. Both PLAs emphasize workforce training through registered apprenticeships and hiring veterans and local workers. For example, the New York PLA includes a partnership with a local pre-apprenticeship program, which will prepare a diverse workforce for entry into construction trades, and the Idaho PLA includes measures to increase construction work by underserved communities.\n\nThe PMT includes at least $40 million in proposed dedicated workforce funding to help Micron \u2013 an industry leader in workforce development \u2013 secure the highly skilled workforce it needs to build and operate these fabs. As part of its commitment to developing a robust local talent pipeline in New York, Micron has forged strong partnerships with local communities, universities, and community colleges \u2013 including Syracuse University and Onondaga Community College (OCC) in New York, and College of Western Idaho (CWI) and Boise State University in Idaho \u2013 to train and recruit its manufacturing workforce. These partnerships have enabled Micron to launch its first-ever Registered Apprenticeship Program in Idaho in collaboration with CWI and the Idaho Manufacturing Alliance. This program currently supports 21 active apprentices ranging from recent high school graduates to adults switching industries. Scaling this program, Micron will partner with the Manufacturer\u2019s Association of Central New York and surrounding education providers, including OCC, to design and launch a Registered Apprenticeship program in New York to support workforce needs.\n\nMicron is also working with the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) and its affiliates the New York State United Teachers and the United Federation of Teachers to help students get ready for the thousands of new technical careers in the semiconductor industry by piloting a curricular framework, teacher training, and work-based learning opportunities in 10 New York districts. After piloting the framework, it will be made widely accessible \u2013 enabling other communities to scale this program that supports the alignments of education and workforce development programs, starting with K-12 students.\n\nMicron is committed to providing accessible, affordable, reliable, and high-quality child care options for its workforce. In Boise, Idaho, Micron will be opening a near-site 124-seat child care center to families in September of 2024, which will be run by the YMCA, to help bolster child care availability in the region. Similarly, in New York, Micron is in the early-stage processes of planning a new facility for employees. Across both locations, the company provides a wide set of child care offerings, including backup care, care-navigation tools, including for home based and non-traditional hour care, via their local Child Care Resource and Referral partnerships, as well as a Dependent Care Flexible Spend Account.\n\nMicron will design and operate their New York megafab according to their sustainability framework and commitments while using green infrastructure during the construction of the fabs. Micron also plans to use 100% renewable electricity and mitigate greenhouse gases with the goal of net-zero emissions by 2050.\n\nIn addition to the proposed direct funding, the CHIPS Program Office would make up to $7.5 billion of proposed loans \u2013 which is part of the $75 billion in loan authority provided by the CHIPS and Science Act \u2013 available to Micron under the PMT. New York State has also committed to providing $5.5 billion in incentives for Micron\u2019s project in Clay, New York. Additionally, Micron has worked with New York State to create the Green CHIPS Community Investment Fund that will invest $500 million, including $250 million from Micron, in community and workforce development over the duration of the project. In Idaho, Micron has signed a Community Investment Framework alongside the state and city of Boise, and the company has committed $75 million over the next 10 years toward workforce development and community priorities. Micron will also benefit from an incentive package in the state of Idaho, including reduced state taxes related to the project and substantial investments in semiconductor workforce training programs. The company has also indicated that it plans to claim the Department of the Treasury\u2019s Investment Tax Credit, which is expected to be up to 25% of qualified capital expenditures.\n\nAs explained in its first Notice of Funding Opportunity, the Department may offer applicants a PMT on a non-binding basis after satisfactory completion of the merit review of a full application. The PMT outlines key terms for a potential CHIPS incentives award, including the amount and form of the award. The award amounts are subject to due diligence and negotiation of a long-form term sheet and award documents and are conditional on the achievement of certain milestones. After the PMT is signed, the Department begins a comprehensive due diligence process on the proposed projects and continues negotiating or refining certain terms with the applicant. The terms contained in the long-form term sheet and the final award documents may differ from the terms of the PMT being announced today.\n\nAbout CHIPS for America\n\nThe Department has received more than 640 statements of interest, more than 190 pre-applications and full applications for NOFO 1, and more than 160 small supplier concept plans for NOFO 2. The Department is continuing to conduct rigorous evaluation of applications to determine which projects will advance U.S. national and economic security, attract more private capital, and deliver other economic benefits to the country. The announcement with Micron is the seventh PMT announcement the Department of Commerce has made under the CHIPS and Science Act, with additional PMT announcements expected to follow throughout 2024.\n\nCHIPS for America is part of President Biden\u2019s economic plan to invest in America, stimulate private sector investment, create good-paying jobs, make more in the United States, and revitalize communities left behind. CHIPS for America includes the CHIPS Program Office, responsible for manufacturing incentives, and the CHIPS Research and Development Office, responsible for R&D programs, that both sit within the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) at the Department of Commerce. NIST promotes U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness by advancing measurement science, standards, and technology in ways that enhance economic security and improve our quality of life. NIST is uniquely positioned to successfully administer the CHIPS for America program because of the bureau\u2019s strong relationships with U.S. industries, its deep understanding of the semiconductor ecosystem, and its reputation as fair and trusted.

(Susan Walsh / Associated Press)\n\nAs the more capricious politician, Trump might undermine such alliances, providing a vacuum for Beijing to step in and strengthen ties with U.S.-friendly nations. However, his impulsive tendencies could trigger a rapid deterioration of the relationship between China and the United States.\n\n\u201cWith the Biden administration, the Chinese side is concerned with the long-term power play,\u201d said Minghao Zhao, deputy director for the Center for American Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai. \u201cIf we have a Trump presidency, we have to be worried about more turbulence.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Biden administration has made some efforts to improve frayed ties with China. In November, Biden and President Xi Jinping met in Silicon Valley and agreed to restart military-to-military communications, which China suspended in retaliation for then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s visit to Taiwan in 2022. Analysts said the pact was critical in preventing flare-ups from becoming broader conflicts.\n\n\u201cFor two large countries like China and the United States, turning their back on each other is not an option,\u201d Xi said.\n\nStill, sticking points remain.\n\nWhen Biden was asked if he trusted Xi, he invoked an old Russian adage popularized by President Reagan during the Cold War: \u201cTrust but verify.\u201d\n\nThe current administration\u2019s focus on Chinese \u201covercapacity\u201d in metals and electric cars signals more sparring over technology and trade and China\u2019s impact on U.S. industries.\n\nLast week, Biden called for the tripling of tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from China to combat what he described as \u201cunfair trade practices,\u201d and a flood of cheap, low-quality products that have distorted the U.S. market.\n\nThe latest initiative builds upon the trade war that Trump launched in 2018, implementing 25% duties on billions of dollars of imports from China, such as cars, metals and machinery. In February, Trump threatened to raise tariffs on Chinese imports to 60% or more if he became president again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nU.S. officials also have become more wary of Chinese software and the security risks it poses for U.S. users. On Wednesday, Biden signed into law a measure that would either ban or force a sale of the Chinese-owned short video app TikTok.\n\nThat same bill included about $8 billion in security assistance for Taiwan, which Beijing considers part of its territory. The sovereignty of the self-ruled island is a particularly contentious impasse in U.S.-China relations, as Washington has strengthened ties with Taiwanese officials and China has increased military aggression.\n\nChina said it opposed the aid allocated for Taiwan and has accused the U.S. of enabling the island democracy to pursue formal independence. Biden has said publicly that the U.S. would send military assistance to Taiwan if China attacked, but the administration has clarified that U.S. policy has not changed \u2014 that the United States acknowledges Beijing\u2019s claim to the island but does not endorse it.\n\nThe U.S. has warned China against providing aid to Russia in its war with Ukraine, and has considered sanctioning Chinese banks to deter support, the Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday. U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken is expected to discuss Ukraine among other disputes during a visit to China this week, and issued a warning ahead of his arrival.\n\n\u201cIf China purports on the one hand to want good relations with Europe and other countries, it can\u2019t on the other hand be fueling what is the biggest threat to European security since the end of the Cold War,\u201d Blinken said Friday.\n\nChina said the U.S. was making \u201cgroundless accusations.\u201d It also objected in a formal complaint to the World Trade Organization to recent U.S. legislation offering subsidies to incentivize domestic manufacturing of electric vehicles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring the last election, some analysts had predicted that Biden would be softer on China compared with Trump. This time, it\u2019s clear that neither candidate is likely to reverse a decade-long hardening against China, said Ho-fung Hung, a professor of political economy at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nThat shift began with President Obama\u2019s efforts to establish stronger economic and diplomatic ties in Asia, spurred by growing unease with Beijing\u2019s military assertiveness, as well as complaints that Chinese competitors were unfairly squeezing out U.S. companies, Hung said.\n\nNow, \u201cthe only difference between different presidents would be the details and approaches of how they implement the toughening policy,\u201d he said.\n\nThen-President Trump speaks as China\u2019s President Xi Jinping, far left, listens during a bilateral meeting at the G-20 summit in Buenos Aires in 2018. (Pablo Martinez Monsivais / Associated Press)\n\nBoth candidates have a history of angering China with public remarks. After their November meeting, Biden again referred to Xi as a dictator. And while Trump has been quicker to praise Xi, he maligned China during the outbreak of COVID-19, which he insistently referred to as the \u201cChinese virus.\u201d\n\nMinxin Pei, a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College, said that stronger anti-China rhetoric among Republicans may inevitably beget harsher China policies under Trump.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re being so tough on China, it might be difficult for them to climb down,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Ja Ian Chong, an associate professor of political science at the National University of Singapore, said that since Trump doesn\u2019t adhere to political conventions, Beijing may see more opportunity to negotiate with the former real estate mogul.\n\n\u201cSince Biden is tough anyway, it may be worth the risk to roll the dice and see what Trump might bring,\u201d Chong said.\n\nSome reports on Chinese disinformation campaigns also indicate a potential preference for a Trump presidency.\n\nAn April report from the London-based Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a research organization, identified a network of Chinese government-linked social media accounts impersonating Trump supporters and propagating criticisms of Biden.\n\nHowever, academics said attempts to spread information by Chinese actors are probably more geared toward sowing doubt in democracy and America rather than directly targeting Trump or Biden.\n\n\u201cI think they are more interested in showing that democratic elections are not an effective system,\u201d Sun from the Stimson Center said. \u201cIn that sense, undermining credibility is more important for China than undermining a specific candidate.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCommentators from Chinese state and social media have criticized both candidates as indicative of the flaws of democracy and America\u2019s decline. An April commentary from China\u2019s official state news agency said money, rather than voters, would ultimately decide the next U.S. president.\n\nSima Nan, a Chinese television pundit, said in a video on Chinese social media last year that a race between Biden and Trump would be a difficult choice \u2014 like picking between spoiled Coke or spoiled Pepsi.\n\nSpecial correspondent Xin-yun Wu in Taipei contributed to this report.\n\n",

The law stipulates that ByteDance must sell its stake in TikTok in 12 months under the threat of being shut down.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe move is the culmination of Washington turning the screws on TikTok for years.\n\nChinese tech giant ByteDance, in 2017, purchased the popular karaoke app Musical.ly and relaunched the service as TikTok. Since then, the app has been under the microscope of national security officials in Washington fearing possible influence by the Chinese government.\n\nDespite concerns in Washington, TikTok has soared. It has become the trendsetter in the world of short-form video and is used by 170 million Americans, which is about half of the country. It is where one-third of young people get their news, according to Pew Research Center.\n\nYet lawmakers and the Biden administration argue that as long as TikTok is owned by a Chinese company, it is beholden to the dictates of China's authoritarian regime\n\n\"Congress is not acting to punish ByteDance, TikTok or any other individual company,\" said Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell, who chairs the Senate Commerce Committee, in remarks on the Senate floor Tuesday afternoon.\n\n\"Congress is acting to prevent foreign adversaries from conducting espionage, surveillance, maligned operations, harming vulnerable Americans, our servicemen and women, and our U.S. government personnel.\"\n\nIn a video posted to the platform soon after Biden signed the bill, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew said he is confident TikTok would win in court, adding that users should not expect issues with the app in the meantime.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"Rest assured, we aren't going anywhere,\" Chew said. \"The facts and the Constitution are on our side and we expect to prevail again.\"\n\nTikTok plans to take Biden administration to court over the law\n\nIf not sold within a year, the law would make it illegal for web-hosting services to support TikTok, and it would force Google and Apple to remove TikTok from app stores \u2014 rendering the app unusable with time.\n\nIt marks the first time the U.S. has passed a law that could trigger the ban of a social media platform, something that has been condemned by civil liberties groups and constitutional scholars.\n\nTikTok has vowed to take the Biden administration to court, claiming the law would suppress the free speech of millions of Americans.\n\nThe sentiment was echoed by Kate Ruane, who runs the Center for Democracy & Technology's Free Expression Project, who said the law is unconstitutional and a blow to free expression in the U.S.\n\n\"Congress shouldn't be in the business of banning platforms,\" Ruane said. \"They should be working to enact comprehensive privacy legislation that protects our private data no matter where we choose to engage online.\"\n\nSelling TikTok won't be so easy\n\nAny company, or set of investors, angling to purchase TikTok would have to receive the blessing of the Chinese government, and officials in Beijing have strongly resisted a forced sell.\n\nIn particular, ByteDance owns the engine of TikTok, its hyper-personalized algorithm that pulls people in and keeps them highly engaged with their feed.\n\nChinese officials have placed content-recommendation algorithms on what is known as an export-control list, meaning the government has additional say over how the technology is ever sold.\n\nLaw took TikTok by surprise\n\nBy almost any measure, the law passed rapidly, and it caught many inside TikTok off guard, especially because the company had just breathed a sigh of relief.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nLast month, the House passed a bill to compel TikTok to find a buyer, or face a nationwide ban, but the effort stalled in the Senate.\n\nThe legislation gave TikTok a six-month window to find a buyer, which some senators said was too little time.\n\nA new push, this time attaching the divest-or-be-banned provision to foreign aid, fasted-tracked the proposal. It mirrors last month's attempt, but it extends the sell-by deadline, now giving TikTok nine months to find a buyer, with the option of a three-month extension if a potential acquisition is in play.\n\nSen. Markey: 'American companies are doing the same thing'\n\nLawmakers from both parties have argued that TikTok poses a national security risk to Americans, since the Chinese government could use the app to spy on Americans, or influence what U.S. users see on their TikTok feeds, something that has gained new urgency in an election year.\n\nBut some have pushed back, including Democratic Sen. Edward Markey of Massachusetts. He said on the Senate floor on Tuesday that there is \"no credible evidence\" that TikTok presents a real national security threat just because its parent company is based in China.\n\nNational intelligence laws in China would require ByteDance to hand over data on Americans if authorities there sought it, but TikTok says it has never received such a request.\n\nMarkey said concerns about digital security, the mental health of young people and data privacy should be addressed with comprehensive legislation encompassing the entire tech industry, not just TikTok.\n\n\"TikTok poses a serious risk to the privacy and mental health of our young people,\" Markey said. \"But that problem isn't unique to TikTok and certainly doesn't justify a TikTok ban,\" he said. \"American companies are doing the same thing, too.\"",

        "text": "Trump allies Meadows, Giuliani among 18 indicted in Arizona election scheme\nThe charges relate to their alleged efforts to undermine President Joe Biden\u2019s election victory in 2020.\n\nA grand jury in the state of Arizona has charged Donald Trump\u2019s chief of staff Mark Meadows, lawyer Rudy Giuliani and 16 others for their alleged roles in trying to overturn the former United States president\u2019s loss in the 2020 election.\n\nThe indictment released late on Wednesday by the state attorney general names 11 Republicans who submitted a document to Congress falsely declaring that Trump had won the key state in 2020.\n\nThey include the former state party chair, a 2022 US Senate candidate and two sitting state lawmakers. They are charged with nine counts each of conspiracy, fraud and forgery.\n\nThe identities of the seven others, including Giuliani and Meadows, were redacted by the attorney general because they had not yet been officially served with the documents, but they were easily identifiable based on their descriptions.\n\nThe indictment mentions the chief of staff in 2020, the position Meadows held in the Trump White House at that time.\n\nTrump himself was not charged but was referred to as an unindicted co-conspirator.\n\nThe charges were filed after a yearlong investigation by Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes, a Democrat, on the handling of the election by Republicans in the key swing state that President Joe Biden won in 2020 by a mere 10,457 votes.\n\nThe southwestern state now becomes the fourth after Michigan, Georgia and Nevada to pursue charges against Trump allies who used false or unproven claims about voter fraud.\n\n\u201cI will not allow American democracy to be undermined,\u201d Mayes said in a video released by her office. \u201cIt\u2019s too important.\u201d\n\nBut Trump and his supporters continue to make claims against Biden\u2019s victory in the 2020 election as the former president gears up to face off again against the Democratic incumbent in the November election.\n\nGeorge Terwilliger, a lawyer representing Meadows, said he had not yet seen the indictment but if Meadows is named, \u201cit is a blatantly political and politicised accusation and will be contested and defeated.\u201d\n\nTed Goodman, a spokesman for Giuliani, responded: \u201cContinued weaponisation of our justice system should concern every American as it does permanent, irrevocable harm to the country.\u201d\n\nTrump himself has been charged in four criminal cases. The first went to trial this month in New York. It concerns alleged \u201chush money\u201dpayments to adult film star Stormy Daniels to buy her silence after she alleged a sexual encounter with Trump, which he has denied. He is charged with falsifying business records to cover up the payments before the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe former president was also indicted in August in federal court over efforts to cling to power after being defeated in the 2020 election. The US Supreme Court on Thursday will hear arguments on Trump\u2019s claim in that case that he can\u2019t be prosecuted for acts he committed while serving as president.\n\nThe other two indictments are an election interference case in the state of Georgia and a federal case in Florida involving the mishandling of classified documents.",

        "text": "What would Trump\u2019s Israel-Gaza policy be if he were re-elected?\nAt a windy rally in Schnecksville, Pennsylvania, earlier this month, Donald Trump began his hour-long address by sending prayers and support to Israel as it withstood Iran\u2019s aerial assault.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re under attack right now,\u201d the former president and presumptive Republican nominee said. \u201cThat\u2019s because we show great weakness.\u201d\n\nTrump, who often describes himself as the \u201cbest friend that Israel has ever had\u201d, blamed Tehran\u2019s bombardment \u2013 and the entire bloody crisis \u2013 on Joe Biden, claiming it \u201cwould not have happened\u201d if he had been president.\n\nYet moments later, he appeared to agree with his supporters when they began chanting \u201cGenocide Joe\u201d \u2013 a term more commonly invoked by activists protesting against Biden\u2019s abiding support for Israel\u2019s war against Hamas in Gaza, which has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians and pushed the territory to the brink of famine.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not wrong,\u201d the former president said, as he stepped away from the lectern and let them chant. (His campaign did not respond to a request for clarification on the remark.)\n\nMore than six months into the ruinous Middle East conflict, amid fears of a wider regional war, Trump has offered plenty of criticism \u2013 of Biden, his successor and all-but-certain rival for the White House, and of Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister \u2013 but few details on what he might have done differently.\n\nTrump\u2019s relative silence leaves major questions about how he would act if he were to inherit the conflict in January.\n\nHis campaign did not directly respond to a list of policy questions, among them whether he supports a ceasefire, how he would handle hostage negotiations, whether there are any circumstances under which he would consider conditioning aid to Israel and whether he supports a two-state solution, an idea some of his former advisers categorically reject.\n\nYet in his muddled commentary, observers see the same motivations that shaped his first-term foreign policy: personal grievance and political opportunism, as discontent with Biden\u2019s management of the conflict threatens to hurt the president\u2019s re-election bid.\n\nTrump v Netanyahu\n\nWhen Trump was president, he forged a close, mutually beneficial relationship with Netanyahu. But his feelings for the prime minister reportedly soured after Netanyahu congratulated Biden on his 2020 election victory, which Trump baselessly claims to have won.\n\nDays after the deadly Hamas attack on 7 October, Trump criticized Netanyahu and Israeli intelligence for failing to anticipate and stop the invasion. He also referred to Hezbollah, the powerful Iran-backed militant group in Lebanon that Israel has been clashing with on its northern border, as \u201cvery smart\u201d.\n\nThe former president\u2019s rebuke of Netanyahu, as his country reeled from what the prime minister said was the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust, drew unusually sharp denunciations from fellow Republicans, including many of his challengers for the party\u2019s presidential nomination.\n\nTrump quickly retreated, writing on his social media platform that he stood with Netanyahu and Israel. Hours later, he posted again, declaring in a video: \u201cI kept Israel safe, remember that. I kept Israel safe. Nobody else will, nobody else can.\u201d\n\nSince then, as public perceptions of the war shift amid a soaring Palestinian death toll and a deepening humanitarian crisis, Trump has surprised some of his allies on the right by exhorting Israel to \u201cfinish up your war\u201d.\n\nTrump is delusional on this point. He doesn\u2019t have any idea what to do in the Middle East in this situation John Bolton, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser\n\n\u201cIsrael has to be very careful, because you\u2019re losing a lot of the world, you\u2019re losing a lot of support,\u201d Trump said in a March interview with the conservative Israeli publication Israel Hayom. \u201cYou have to finish up, you have to get the job done. And you have to get on to peace.\u201d\n\nAsked in a later interview with the conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt whether his comments had been misconstrued, Trump again implored Israel to \u201cget it over with\u201d, warning that the country was \u201cabsolutely losing the PR war\u201d. Biden has similarly expressed concern that Israel\u2019s tactics in Gaza are hurting its international standing.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s get back to peace and stop killing people,\u201d Trump told Hewitt.\n\nCalling for peace, but little regard for Palestinians\n\nTrump has not outlined how he believes peace might be achieved or what he envisions for the region after the conflict ends. When pressed on his position, Trump mostly repeats his claim that the war wouldn\u2019t have happened if he were in power.\n\n\u201cI just think Trump is delusional on this point,\u201d John Bolton, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, said in a recent appearance on CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s a point that nobody can refute or confirm one way or the other. He doesn\u2019t have any idea what to do in the Middle East in this situation.\u201d\n\nPlaying critic, rather than prospective commander-in-chief, has seemingly worked in Trump\u2019s favor: voters gave him far better marks than Biden on his handling of foreign conflicts as president, according to an April New York Times and Siena College survey.\n\nAnd by mostly remaining on the sidelines, some analysts say, he is better positioned to exploit the deep division in the Democratic coalition over Biden\u2019s handling of the Israel-Gaza war, one of the president\u2019s biggest perceived vulnerabilities before the election.\n\nAaron David Miller, who served for two decades as a state department analyst, negotiator and adviser on Middle East issues for both Democratic and Republican administrations, said a future Trump administration was unlikely to show much sympathy to the Palestinian cause.\n\n\u201cHe could care less, frankly, about how the Israelis are treating the Palestinians,\u201d said Miller, now a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\n\u201cForget any kind of rehabilitation or reconstruction for Gaza,\u201d he added, unless rebuilding the territory was a condition for achieving \u201csome historic something\u201d in the region, such as a normalization of ties between Israeli and Saudi Arabia.\n\nIn statements since the war began, Trump has promised, if elected, to cut off all US aid to Palestinians and urged other nations to follow suit if he returns to the Oval Office.\n\nThe former president also pledged to bar refugees from Gaza under an expansion of his first-term travel ban on Muslim-majority countries; expel immigrants who sympathize with Hamas; revoke the visas of foreign students deemed \u201canti-American\u201d or \u201cantisemitic\u201d; and impose \u201cstrong ideological screening\u201d to keep out foreign nationals who \u201cwant to abolish Israel\u201d.\n\nTrump\u2019s pitch to Jewish voters\n\nIn a statement, Trump\u2019s campaign accused Biden and Democrats of supporting Israel\u2019s enemies and said leftwing criticism of Netanyahu\u2019s government was pushing American Jews into the former president\u2019s camp.\n\n\u201cJewish Americans are realizing that the Democrat party has turned into a full-blown anti-Israel, antisemitic, pro-terrorist cabal, and that\u2019s why more and more Jewish Americans are supporting President Trump,\u201d said a campaign spokesperson, Karoline Leavitt.\n\nHe could care less, frankly, about how the Israelis are treating the Palestinians Aaron David Miller, former state department analyst, negotiator and Middle East adviser\n\nBut Trump\u2019s outreach to Jewish voters, a wide majority of whom tend to support Democrats, has faced accusations of antisemitism.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump told reporters in Georgia that \u201cany Jewish person that votes for a Democrat or votes for Biden should have their head examined\u201d. In a March interview with his former aide Sebastian Gorka, Trump claimed that any Jewish American who backs the Democrats \u201chates their religion\u201d and \u201ceverything about Israel\u201d.\n\nThe comments, which echoed previous statements he has made, were widely condemned for invoking an antisemitic trope that Jewish citizens hold \u201cdual loyalty\u201d to both the US and Israel.\n\nBut Trump has also honed a sharp-edged pitch aimed at evangelical Christians, a crucial part of his base whose fierce support of Israel has helped shape Republican foreign policy.\n\nCasting himself as the great protector of the world\u2019s only Jewish state, Trump vowed in an October speech to \u201cdefend western civilization from the barbarians and savages and fascists that you see now trying to do harm to our beautiful Israel\u201d.\n\nLessons from Trump\u2019s presidency\n\nThough Trump has sent mixed signals about his views of the war, his policies as president unambiguously favored Israel.\n\nDuring his presidency, Trump moved the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and recognized Israel\u2019s sovereignty over the Golan Heights, in a reversal of longstanding US policy. He also slashed funding to the UN agency supporting Palestinian refugees and closed the Palestinians\u2019 diplomatic mission in Washington.\n\nIn 2018, he withdrew the US from the Iran nuclear deal, a move cheered by Republicans and Netanyahu. The following year, the Trump administration again broke with decades of precedent to declare that the US no longer considered Israeli settlements in the West Bank a violation of international law. The Biden administration reversed this policy in February.\n\nLate in his presidency, Trump unveiled a Middle East \u201cpeace\u201d plan that granted most of Israel\u2019s long-held demands, ensuring its swift rejection by Palestinian leaders.\n\nThe former president\u2019s biggest accomplishment in the region was the so-called Abraham accords, clinched in 2020, which normalized diplomatic relations among Israel, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. In remarks to Jewish donors and activists, Trump claimed he had been on the verge of bringing Iran into the deal, even though he spent much of his presidency antagonizing Tehran, most notably by ordering the assassination of Qassem Soleimani in 2020.\n\nWhile Israel and Iran appear to have pulled back from the brink of a spiraling regional war, tensions in the region remain high. Meanwhile, Trump has been isolated in a New York courtroom, where the former president faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in the first of his criminal trials.\n\nIsrael and a second Trump term\n\nTrump has yet to provide any substantive details on how he views the role of the US in resolving the current conflict, and his campaign did not respond to questions about his postwar plans for Gaza or whether he supported a two-state solution.\n\nBut recent comments from Trump\u2019s former ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, and Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, both of whom helped set his first-term Middle East policy, reflect Netanyahu\u2019s rightwing, nationalist vision for the region.\n\nI think that his foreign policy will continue to be chaotic, transactional and opportunistic Aaron David Miller, former state department analyst, negotiator and Middle East adviser\n\nFriedman recently unveiled a proposal for Israel to annex the West Bank based on the country\u2019s biblical claims to the occupied land. In an interview last month, Trump did not say whether he supported the plan but said he planned to meet with Friedman to discuss it. (His campaign declined to say whether the meeting had taken place.)\n\nIn a February interview with the Middle East Initiative at Harvard University, Kushner, a real estate scion married to Trump\u2019s daughter, Ivanka Trump, said Gaza\u2019s \u201cwaterfront property\u201d could be \u201cvery valuable\u201d. He also suggested Israel could move civilians out of the southern Gaza city of Rafah, where more than 1.5 million displaced Palestinians are sheltering, to Israel\u2019s Negev desert while Israeli forces \u201cfinish the job\u201d there. Asked about fears that Palestinians who flee Gaza may not be allowed to return, he said: \u201cI am not sure there is much left of Gaza at this point.\u201d\n\nAt another point, Kushner described proposals to give the Palestinians their own state as a \u201csuper bad idea\u201d that \u201cwould essentially be rewarding an act of terror\u201d.\n\nMiller recalled a 2017 conversation with Kushner in which Kushner outlined three key pillars of Trump\u2019s Middle East policy that Miller believes would extend to a second term.\n\nThey were, according to Miller, to make it \u201cimpossible\u201d for an Israeli prime minister to say no to Trump, develop \u201cstrategic partnerships\u201d with the Gulf states, including Saudi Arabia; and to create a \u201cwhole new paradigm for how to deal with the Palestinian issue\u201d.\n\nIf Trump returns to the White House next year, Miller expects little change in his approach: \u201cI think that his foreign policy will continue to be chaotic, transactional and opportunistic.\u201d\n\nBiden v Trump: What\u2019s in store for the US and the world?\n\nOn Thursday 2 May, 3-4.15pm ET, join Tania Branigan, David Smith, Mehdi Hasan and Tara Setmayer for the inside track on the people, the ideas and the events that might shape the US election campaign.

        "text": "Meadows, Giuliani among indicted in Arizona in latest 2020 election subversion case\nCNN \u2014\n\nA grand jury in Arizona has handed up an indictment against former President Donald Trump\u2019s allies over their efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss, including the fake electors from that state and several individuals connected to his campaign.\n\nBoris Epshteyn, a former White House aide who remains one of Trump\u2019s closest advisers; former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows; and Rudy Giuliani are among those who have been indicted, according to a source familiar with the investigation.\n\nArizona Attorney General Kris Mayes, a Democrat, announced the indictment Wednesday night, focusing on the 11 individuals who acted as pro-Trump electors in the state. The names of several other indicted defendants remain redacted, Mayes said in a statement Wednesday, until those people have been served.\n\n\u201cA state grand jury made up of everyday regular Arizonans, has now handed down felony indictments for all 11 Republican electors as well as several others connected to this scheme,\u201d Mayes said. \u201cThese are serious indictments, but this is the first hurdle the state must pass in our constitutional criminal justice system. We intend to prove these crimes were committed beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d\n\nWhile Trump is not among those charged in Arizona, the details in the indictment suggest he is \u201cUnindicted Coconspirator 1.\u201d\n\nCNN is reaching out to those charged for comment.\n\nTrump allies \u2018deceived the citizens of Arizona\u2019 after 2020 election, indictment alleges\n\nThe indictment in Arizona includes nine counts, from conspiracy and forgery to engaging in fraudulent schemes. Because the indictment remains partially redacted, it is unclear what charges Trump allies such as Meadows, Epshteyn and Giuliani face.\n\n\u201cIn Arizona, and the United States, the people elected Joseph Biden as President on November 3, 2020,\u201d the indictment reads. \u201cUnwilling to accept this fact, Defendants and unindicted coconspirators schemed to prevent the lawful transfer of the presidency to keep Unindicted Coconspirator 1 in office against the will of Arizona\u2019s voters.\u201d\n\nThe scheme, according to the indictment, called for the fake electors to fraudulently vote for Trump, \u201cfalsely claiming to be the duly elected and qualified Electors for President and Vice President of the United States from the State of Arizona.\u201d\n\n\u201cDefendants deceived the citizens of Arizona by falsely claiming that those votes were contingent only on a legal challenge that would change the outcome of the election,\u201d the indictment continues. \u201cIn reality, Defendants intended that their false votes for Trump-Pence would encourage Pence to reject the Biden-Harris votes on January 6, 2021, regardless of the outcome of the legal challenge.\u201d\n\nThis scheme failed on January 6, 2021, when then-Vice President Mike Pence accepted the electoral votes for Joe Biden, the indictment says.\n\nThe case in Arizona adds scrutiny to actions taken on Trump\u2019s behalf after the last election. It also comes as Trump\u2019s legal team will argue before the Supreme Court Thursday that he\u2019s immune from prosecution in the federal election interference case \u2013 at the same time Trump is on trial in New York related to hush money paid to cover up an alleged affair before the 2016 election.\n\nFirst charges for Trump legal adviser over 2020 election efforts\n\nEpshteyn has not been charged before in connection with 2020 post-election efforts to reverse Trump\u2019s loss. Serving as a legal adviser to Trump, Epshteyn speaks to the former president regularly, and during certain stretches, multiple times a day. He is widely considered one of Trump\u2019s most ferociously loyal advisers, since joining Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign.\n\nEpshteyn accompanied Trump to New York after his criminal indictment and sat with him in the courtroom while he was arraigned. He was also seen traveling with Trump to arraignments in both Georgia and Washington, DC. While he does not represent him in any of his current legal cases, Epshteyn has played a critical role in the hiring of many of Trump\u2019s lawyers as well as in some of their departures.\n\nAfter withdrawing from representing Trump in the special counsel\u2019s investigation into Trump\u2019s handling of classified documents, Timothy Parlatore, who was brought on by Epshteyn, said differences with Epshteyn spurred his departure.\n\n\u201cHe did everything he could do to try to block us,\u201d Parlatore said on CNN.\n\nOthers in Trump\u2019s orbit have long said that Epshteyn\u2019s brash behavior could be a liability for Trump.\n\nEastman and Trump 2020 campaign officials also indicted\n\nWhile the names of several defendants in the Arizona case remain redacted because they have not yet been served, the indictment does describe their roles in the alleged plot.\n\nOther individuals charged in the Arizona indictment but whose names have been redacted, the source familiar with the investigation told CNN, include Trump allies Mike Roman, a 2020 campaign official; Trump campaign lawyer Jenna Ellis; and conservative attorney John Eastman.\n\nRoman, Ellis and Eastman also were charged in the election subversion case in Georgia, as were Meadows and Giuliani. Ellis pleaded guilty to one charge in the Georgia case. The others have pleaded not guilty.\n\nMeadows, whose name is redacted in the indictment but is listed as Trump\u2019s chief of staff in 2020, \u201cworked with members of the Trump Campaign to coordinate and implement the false Republican electors\u2019 votes in Arizona and six other states,\u201d the indictment says, and \u201cwas involved in the many efforts to keep (Trump) in power despite his defeat at the polls.\u201d\n\nThe individual who CNN has identified as Giuliani is described as spreading false claims of voter fraud across the country after the 2020 election, falsely claiming Arizona officials \u201cmade no effort to find out\u201d if the vote was accurate, and encouraging \u201cRepublican electors in Arizona and in six other contested states to vote for Trump-Pence on December 14, 2020,\u201d the indictment says.\n\nOther unnamed defendants allegedly worked to overthrow the 2020 election results by encouraging Pence to reject or delay the certification of the electoral vote on January 6, spreading false claims of voter fraud, encouraging the fake electors and working to implement the fake electors scheme in Arizona.\n\nEastman\u2019s attorney Charles Burnham told CNN in a statement that his client is innocent of any criminal conduct.\n\n\u201cThe phenomenon of partisan lawfare grows more troubling by the day. Professor Eastman is innocent of criminal conduct in Arizona or any other place and will fight these charges as he has all the other unjust accusations leveled against him,\u201d Burnham said.\n\nArizona state Sen. Jake Hoffman, one of the fake electors charged in the indictment, released a statement on X following the indictment.\n\n\u201cLet me be unequivocal, I am innocent of any crime, I will vigorously defend myself, and I look forward to the day when I am vindicated of this disgusting political persecution by the judicial process,\u201d Hoffman wrote.\n\nAlso among those indicted is former Trump lawyer and One America News Network host Christina Bobb.\n\nBobb was recently named as the Republican National Committee\u2019s counsel for Election Integrity despite her role in efforts to overturn the 2020 election for Trump. She has not previously been charged in other investigations related to efforts to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nThe Republican Party of Arizona also slammed the indictments in a statement Wednesday.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s indictments by Attorney General Kris Mayes represent a blatant and unprecedented abuse of prosecutorial power, aimed solely at distracting the public from the critical policy debates our country should be focusing on as we approach the 2024 election,\u201d the statement said.\n\nDemocratic Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs told CNN\u2019s Abby Phillip Wednesday that she hoped to see those indicted held accountable.\n\n\u201cAs Secretary of State I oversaw free, fair, secure elections in Arizona and defended the votes of millions of Arizonans,\u201d Hobbs said on \u201cNewsNight.\u201d \u201cI am confident that Attorney General Mayes conducted a fair and impartial investigation and grand jury process, and now the justice system will do its job.\u201d\n\nLatest prosecution of fake electors schemes\n\nThe Arizona case is the latest state-level prosecution aimed at schemes to upend Biden\u2019s electoral victory. Prosecutors in Michigan, Georgia and Nevada also have brought criminal charges against some of the people who signed on as fake electors in those states. Investigators in Wisconsin are conducting a similar probe.\n\nA grand jury empaneled in Maricopa County, Arizona, to investigate efforts to overturn the 2020 election results in the state met this week before Mayes announced the charges.\n\nCNN previously reported that Arizona prosecutors had issued a series of grand jury subpoenas to people connected to Trump\u2019s campaign and several individuals who served as fake electors from that state \u2013 a sign the probe was accelerating ahead of the 2024 presidential election.\n\nSome of the fake electors who were ultimately charged in Arizona recently appeared before the grand jury and cited their Fifth Amendment protections against self-incrimination, sources familiar with the probe told CNN.\n\nMayes initially focused her investigation on the 11 fake electors from Arizona and those who helped organize them, but the sources recently told CNN she also was looking into individuals tied to the former president\u2019s national campaign.\n\n\u201cWe conducted a thorough and professional investigation over the past 13 months into the fake electoral scheme in our state,\u201d Mayes said Wednesday. \u201cI understand for some of you today didn\u2019t come fast enough. And I know I\u2019ll be criticized by others for conducting this investigation at all. But as I\u2019ve stated before, and will say here again today, I will not allow American democracy to be undermined.\u201d\n\nSeveral state-level officials from Arizona told the House Select Committee that investigated the January 6, 2021, US Capitol riot that Trump and his allies tried to pressure them to decertify the state\u2019s election results.\n\nThe fake electors for Trump convened at the state Republican Party headquarters in Phoenix on December 14, 2020. They broadcast themselves preparing to sign the documents, allegedly provided by a Trump campaign attorney, claiming that they were the legitimate representatives of the state\u2019s electoral votes.\n\nBy that time, Trump\u2019s loss in the state \u2013 by fewer than 11,000 votes \u2013 had already been certified by its Republican governor, affirming that Biden won Arizona in the 2020 presidential election. But in the weeks that followed, some of the fake electors continued to push for Pence to reject the legitimate Democratic slate of electors.\n\nThe fake elector scheme and pressure campaign on Pence are focal points of special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s federal indictment of Trump.\n\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional reporting.\n\nCNN\u2019s Kristen Holmes, Rashard Rose, Katelyn Polantz and Jack Hannah contributed to this report.",

Gonzales-Luna, research assistant professor in the Department of Pharmacy Practice and Translational Research, UH College of Pharmacy, in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases. \u201cIn fact, the prevailing view has been that antibiotic resistance to these strains are unlikely to impact clinical outcomes, given the high concentrations of vancomycin in stools.\u201d\n\nAnne J. Gonzales-Luna, research assistant professor in the Department of Pharmacy Practice and Translational Research, UH College of Pharmacy, reports the weakening of vancomycin, the top antibiotic to combat the superbug C diff.\n\nBut the team arrived at a different conclusion after sifting through research included in a multicenter study, which included adults treated with oral vancomycin between 2016-2021 for C. diff infection.\n\n\u201cWe found reduced vancomycin susceptibility in C. difficile was associated with lower 30-day sustained clinical response and lower 14-day initial cure rates in the studied patient cohort,\u201d said Gonzales-Luna.\n\nThe finding is cause for concern.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an alarming development in the field of C. diff as there are only two recommended antibiotics,\u201d said Kevin Garey, professor of pharmacy practice and translational research. \u201cIf antimicrobial resistance increases in both antibiotics, it will complicate the management of C. diff infection leading us back to a pre-antibiotic era.\u201d\n\nOthers on the research team include Taryn A.

His actions and the actions of others disrupted a joint session of the U.S. Congress convened to ascertain and count the electoral votes related to the 2020 presidential election.\n\nGregory C. Yetman, 47, of Helmetta, New Jersey, pleaded guilty in the District of Columbia to a felony offense of assaulting, resisting, or impeding certain officers with physical contact before U.S. District Chief Judge James E. Boasberg. Judge Boasberg will sentence Yetman on July 22, 2024.\n\nAccording to court documents, Yetman, an enlisted military police officer with the U. S. Army National Guard, traveled to Washington, D.C., on Jan 6. 2021, and attended a rally for then-President Trump at the Ellipse. After the rally, Yetman walked to the west side of the U.S. Capitol building and climbed a platform on the West Terrace. Here, Yetman was among a mob of rioters that had encircled a group of police officers attempting to defend the Capitol building during the civil disorder. An isolated group of officers struggled with the riotous mob but were quickly surrounded and assaulted from all sides.\n\nAt approximately 2:29 p.m., as other rioters continued to assault those officers, Yetman picked up an MK-46H canister containing OC spray (a lachrymatory agent capable of causing serious bodily injury), held the canister under his arm and, from within the effective distance of the spray, and intentionally assaulted the same group of besieged police officers by spraying them with the OC spray. After Yetman sprayed multiple officers for approximately 12-14 seconds, the officers retreated toward other officers and left the area.\n\nYetman then discarded the canister on the platform and, as he retraced his steps, held up a cell phone to take photographs and videos of the riotous mob. Shortly after, Yetman walked up to the Lower West Terrace, where rioters attempted to enter the U.S. Capitol building through the Lower West Terrace Tunnel.\n\nFederal investigators attempted to arrest Yetman for his conduct on January 6th on Nov. 8, 2023. However, as soon as he saw the officers, Yetman first attempted to re-enter his residence and fled into the woods on foot when unable to do so. As he fled, Yetman dropped a knife and a cell phone. Investigators subsequently located multiple firearms and significant quantities of ammunition in his residence, a loaded firearm in his vehicle, and additional firearms and weapons in a storage unit. After an extensive manhunt that lasted several days, Yetman turned himself in to local police officers on Nov. 10, 2023.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia and the Department of Justice National Security Division's Counterterrorism Section prosecuted this case. The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of New Jersey provided valuable assistance.\n\nThe FBI's Newark and Washington Field Offices investigated this case and identified him as BOLO AFO-278 on its seeking information photos. Valuable assistance was provided by the U.S. Capitol Police and the Metropolitan Police Department.\n\nIn the 39 months since Jan. 6, 2021, more than 1,385 individuals have been charged in nearly all 50 states for crimes related to the breach of the U.S. Capitol, including nearly 500 individuals charged with assaulting or impeding law enforcement, a felony. The investigation remains ongoing.\n\nAnyone with tips can call 1-800-CALL-FBI (800-225-5324) or visit tips.fbi.gov.",

Instead, it invalidated the old law that made it a crime to vote while serving a felony sentence, even if the individual was unaware that was against the law.\n\nThe effect of this court order is to prohibit the prosecution of anyone who voted while serving a felony sentence prior to January 2024, when the old law was in effect.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure that everyone understands the current law as it pertains to voting by people in the criminal justice system,\u201d said Karen Brinson Bell, executive director of the State Board of Elections. \u201cThe recent court decision applies to an old law. The current law does not allow someone who is serving a felony sentence to vote. Once they complete their sentence, they are allowed to register and vote in North Carolina.\u201d\n\nOnce their period of supervision is over, a person convicted of a felony automatically regains the right to vote. They must still register to vote, even if they were previously registered prior to their felony conviction.\n\nIf a person is convicted of a misdemeanor in North Carolina, they do not lose the right to vote.\n\nFor more information, see Registering as a Person in the Criminal Justice System.",

        "text": "Why This Election Is the Media\u2019s Opportunity to Rebuild Trust\nGibbs, a former writer and editor in chief at TIME, is the director of the Shorenstein Center and the Edward R. Murrow Professor of the Practice of Press, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard Kennedy School. She is the co-author, along with Michael Duffy, of two best-selling presidential histories: The President\u2019s Club: Inside the World\u2019s Most Exclusive Fraternity and The Preacher and the Presidents: Billy Graham in the White House\n\nWhat does it tell us, my students ask, that nine years after Donald Trump oozed down the golden escalator and into contention as Leader of the Free World, the American press, mainstream edition, is still arguing about how to cover him?\n\nOnce the charge was that he gets millions of dollars in free media because reporters obsessively overcover him; now it\u2019s that he gets a free ride because they have outrage fatigue. If you fact-check his lies, you risk spreading them further; if you don\u2019t, you are normalizing nonsense. Round and round the arguments go, especially now that reporters must weigh how to cover the first criminal trial of a former President, a campaign conducted from a courtroom where voters once again are judge and jury.\n\nJames Madison defended even a young, sloppy, partisan press as a \u201cgreat bulwark of liberty\u201d and you can feel in the growing attacks on press performance an urgent, underlying \u201cdo better; this election is too important to screw up.\u201d Conservatives for years have flayed the \u201clamestream\u201d press as arrogant and agenda-driven but political independents' faith in the media has also dropped rather precipitously and according to Gallup, for the first time more Americans say they have no trust at all in the press than say they have a great deal or a fair amount.\n\nRead More: Is America in Decline?\n\nIn fact, these days the most indignant denunciations of the mainstream political press often come from the left (though this could be because so many on the right have stopped watching and reading). Critics who charge reporters with \u201cfalse equivalency\u201d and \u201cbothsidesism\u201d condemn reporters for performing objectivity rather than practicing it, for normalizing depravity and numbing the audience to each shattered norm. Now that we experience politics in surround sound, inescapable and all-consuming, it\u2019s little wonder researchers are tracking \u201cnews avoidance,\u201d a rational response to coverage that people say feels disconnected from their lives and needs, and leaves them feeling depressed and angry.\n\nThe debate over how to cover this campaign reflects in part the challenge of unprecedentedness; have reporters ever faced more new questions than this fateful election presents? Everything from a candidate campaigning from criminal court to the rarity of presidential rematches to the implications of age, the threats of AI, the speed and scale of contagious falsehood, and sadly, the challenge of doing a job whose business model is shredding beneath us makes practical and ethical choices harder. At the very least, these conditions should be enough to chasten the press critics who suggest that the answers are obvious.\n\nFortunately, while there are few easy answers\u2014we do have to cover the Trump trial and reckon with AI\u2014 there are clear opportunities. The core of journalism remains curiosity, with its patient partner, humility. We are seeing things in our politics we\u2019ve never seen before, which is an invitation to explore and inquire and inform, not in perfunctory \u201cdiner safaris\u201d but in an open-ended, open-minded conversation with people who hear the same speeches, read the same tweets and truths, and come to wildly different conclusions about what they mean and why they matter.\n\nResearch into political division often uncovers mass distortion; we see one another through a glass darkly, exaggerating differences, attributing extreme positions to those who don\u2019t actually hold them. Research by the nonpartisan group More in Common, for instance, drilled down on the radioactive topic of how we teach history. \u201cMany Republicans believe most Democrats want to teach a history defined by shameful oppression and white guilt,\u201d they observed. \u201cMany Democrats believe most Republicans want to focus on the white majority and overlook slavery and racism. But we found that both impressions are wrong.\u201d People at the extremes of left and right are far more likely to post and tweet about politics than the vast center of the electorate, which adds more distortion to the picture.\n\nRead More: The Fantasy of a Lily-White America\n\nThe challenge is that even when you tell voters that their political opponents are less extreme than they think, people don\u2019t believe it. In much of our current media landscape, we aren\u2019t likely to encounter the layered worldviews of voters who hold complex, even apparently contradictory views on everything from tax rates to trans rights to GMOs to wind turbines. Reporters perform a true public service when they embed not in campaigns but in communities, capture the trials and trade-offs of small-business owners and caregivers, working parents and police officers, and refocus the lens from the hated horse race to the intimate, immediate information voters need to make decisions about their lives as well as their votes.\n\nOne reason local news is far more trusted than national news is that it is simply closer to the facts on the ground. But people don\u2019t only trust it more for the information they need to engage with their communities; they trust it far more for information about how to vote. The collapse of local news outlets\u2014more than two newspapers a week go under on average\u2014puts all the more responsibility on larger regional or national newsrooms to fill in the gaps, deploy reporters creatively, recruit local partners, and present a true picture of the issues most relevant to communities.\n\nShow, don\u2019t tell, as we teach young reporters, and there\u2019s no better time or place than the campaign that promises to shape our fates and fortunes for a generation.\n\nMore From TIME",

        "text": "\u2018A lot would have to go wrong for Biden to lose\u2019: can Allan Lichtman predict the 2024 election?\nHe has been called the Nostradamus of US presidential elections. Allan Lichtman has correctly predicted the result of nine of the past 10 (and even the one that got away, in 2000, he insists was stolen from Al Gore). But now he is gearing up for perhaps his greatest challenge: Joe Biden v Donald Trump II.\n\nLichtman is a man of parts. The history professor has been teaching at American University in Washington for half a century. He is a former North American 3,000m steeplechase champion and, at 77 \u2013 the same age as Trump \u2013 aiming to compete in the next Senior Olympics. In 1981 he appeared on the TV quizshow Tic-Tac-Dough and won $110,000 in cash and prizes.\n\nThat same year he developed his now famous 13 keys to the White House, a method for predicting presidential election results that every four years tantalises the media, intrigues political operatives and provokes sniping from pollsters. Long before talk of the Steele dossier or Mueller investigation, it all began with a Russian reaching out across the cold war divide.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d love to tell you I developed my system by ruining my eyes in the archives, by deep contemplation, but if I were to say that, to quote the late great Richard Nixon, that would be wrong,\u201d Lichtman recalls from a book-crowded office on the AU campus. \u201cLike so many discoveries, it was kind of serendipitous.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Allan Lichtman in his office in Washington DC in 2012. Photograph: Paul J Richards/AFP/Getty Images\n\nLichtman was a visiting scholar at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena when he met the world\u2019s leading authority in earthquake prediction, Vladimir Keilis-Borok, who had been part of a Soviet delegation that negotiated the limited nuclear test ban treaty with President John F Kennedy in Washington in 1963.\n\nKeilis-Borok had fallen in love with American politics and began a collaboration with Lichtman to reconceptualise elections in earthquake terms. That is, as a question of stability (the party holding the White House keeps it) versus earthquake (the party holding the White House gets thrown out).\n\nThey looked at every presidential election since Abraham Lincoln\u2019s victory in 1860, combining Keilis-Borok\u2019s method recognising patterns associated with stability and earthquakes with Lichtman\u2019s theory that elections are basically votes up or down on the strength and performance of the party that holds the White House.\n\nThey came up with 13 true/false questions and a decision rule: if six or more keys went against the White House party, it would lose. If fewer than six went against it, it would win. These are the 13 keys, as summarised by AU\u2019s website:\n\n1. Party mandate: After the midterm elections, the incumbent party holds more seats in the US House of Representatives than after the previous midterm elections.\n\n2. Contest: There is no serious contest for the incumbent party nomination.\n\n3. Incumbency: The incumbent party candidate is the sitting president.\n\n4. Third party: There is no significant third party or independent campaign.\n\n5. Short-term economy: The economy is not in recession during the election campaign.\n\n6. Long-term economy: Real per capita economic growth during the term equals or exceeds mean growth during the previous two terms.\n\n7. Policy change: The incumbent administration effects major changes in national policy.\n\n8. Social unrest: There is no sustained social unrest during the term.\n\n9. Scandal: The incumbent administration is untainted by major scandal.\n\n10. Foreign/military failure: The incumbent administration suffers no major failure in foreign or military affairs.\n\n11. Foreign/military success: The incumbent administration achieves a major success in foreign or military affairs.\n\n12. Incumbent charisma: The incumbent party candidate is charismatic or a national hero.\n\n13. Challenger charisma: The challenging party candidate is not charismatic or a national hero.\n\nLichtman and Keilis-Borok published a paper in an academic journal, which was spotted by an Associated Press science reporter, leading to a Washington Post article headlined: \u201cOdd couple discovers keys to the White House.\u201d Then, in the Washingtonian magazine in April 1982, Lichtman used the keys to accurately predict that, despite economic recession, low approval ratings and relative old age, Ronald Reagan would win re-election two years later.\n\nThat led to an invitation to the White House from the presidential aide Lee Atwater, where Lichtman met numerous officials including then vice-president George HW Bush. Atwater asked him what would happen if Reagan did not run for re-election. Lichtman reckoned that a few important keys would be lost, including incumbent charisma.\n\n\u201cWithout the Gipper, forget it,\u201d Lichtman says. \u201cGeorge Bush is about as charismatic as a New Jersey shopping centre on a Sunday morning. Atwater looks me in the eye, breathes a huge sigh of relief, and says, thank you, Professor Lichtman. And the rest is history.\u201d\n\nFor the next election, Bush was trailing his Democratic challenger Michael Dukakis by 18 percentage points in the opinion polls in May 1988, yet Lichtman correctly predicted a Bush victory because he was running on the Reagan inheritance of peace, prosperity, domestic tranquillity and breakthroughs with the Soviet Union.\n\nView image in fullscreen George HW Bush and Michael Dukakis debate on 25 September 1988. Photograph: Bettmann Archive via Getty Images\n\nThat year Lichtman published a book, The Thirteen Keys to the Presidency. But he was still derided by the punditry establishment. \u201cWhen I first developed my system and made my predictions, the professional forecasters blasted me because I had committed the ultimate sin of prediction, the sin of subjectivity.\n\n\u201cSome of my keys were not just cut and dried and I kept telling them, it\u2019s not subjectivity, it\u2019s judgment. We\u2019re dealing with human systems and historians make judgments all the time, and they\u2019re not random judgments. I define each key very carefully in my book and I have a record.\u201d\n\nHe adds: \u201cIt took 15 to 20 years and the professional forecasting community totally turned around. They realised their big mathematical models didn\u2019t work and the best models combined judgment with more cut-and-dried indicators. And suddenly the keys were the hottest thing in forecasting.\u201d\n\nLichtman was a man in demand. He spoke at forecasting conferences, wrote for academic journals and even gave a talk to the CIA about how to apply the 13 keys to foreign elections. And his crystal ball kept working.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Stakes \u2014 Presidential Transition Free newsletter We will guide you through the aftermath of the US election and the transition to a Trump presidency Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Then a call from Little Rock, Arkansas. It was Kay Goss, special assistant to Governor Bill Clinton.\n\n\u201cAre you really saying that George Bush can be beaten in 1992?\u201d she asked. Lichtman confirmed that he was saying that. Clinton went on to win the Democratic primary election and beat Bush for the White House. \u201cThe Clintons have been big fans of the keys ever since,\u201d Lichtman notes.\n\nThe one apparent blot on Lichtman\u2019s copybook is the 2000 election, where he predicted victory for the Democratic vice-president Al Gore over George W Bush, the Republican governor of Texas. Gore did win the national popular vote but lost the electoral college by a gossamer-thin margin. Lichtman, however, believes he was right.\n\nView image in fullscreen Al Gore answers a question during a town hall style debate against George W Bush in St Louis, Missouri, on 17 October 2000. Photograph: Tannen Maury/EPA\n\n\u201cIt was a stolen election. Based on the actual votes, Al Gore should have won going away, except for the discarding of ballots cast by Black voters who were 95% for Gore. I proved this in my report to the United States Commission on Civil Rights. One out of every nine to 10 ballots cast by a Black voter was thrown out, as opposed to one out of 50 cast by a white voter.\n\n\u201cMost of those were not so-called hanging chads. They were over-votes because Black people were told punch in Gore and then write in Gore, just to be sure, and those ballots were all discarded. Political scientists have since looked at the election and proved I was right. Al Gore, based on the intent of the voters, should have won by tens of thousands of votes.\u201d\n\nHe adds: \u201cI contend I was right about 2000 or at a minimum there was no right prediction. You could argue either way. I contend \u2013 and a lot of people agree with me \u2013 that I\u2019m 10 out of 10. But even if you say I\u2019m nine out of 10, that\u2019s not bad.\u201d\n\nPerhaps Lichtman\u2019s most striking prophecy, defying polls, commentators and groupthink, was that Trump \u2013 a former reality TV star with no prior political or military experience \u2013 would pull off a wildly improbable win over the former secretary of state and first lady Hillary Clinton in 2016. How did he know?\n\nView image in fullscreen Donald Trump\u2019s acceptance speech is broadcast in Times Square in New York on 9 November 2016. Photograph: Michael Reaves/Getty Images\n\n\u201cThe critical sixth key was the contest key: Bernie Sanders\u2019s contest against Clinton. It was an open seat so you lost the incumbency key. The Democrats had done poorly in 2014 so you lost that key. There was no big domestic accomplishment following the Affordable Care Act in the previous term, and no big foreign policy splashy success following the killing of Bin Laden in the first term, so there were just enough keys. It was not an easy call.\u201d\n\nAfter the election, Lichtman received a copy of the Washington Post interview in which he made the prediction. On it was written in a Sharpie pen: \u201cCongrats, professor. Good call. Donald J Trump.\u201d But in the same call, Lichtman had also prophesied \u2013 again accurately \u2013 that Trump would one day be impeached.\n\nHe was right about 2020, too, as Trump struggled to handle the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cThe pandemic is what did him in. He congratulated me for predicting him but he didn\u2019t understand the keys. The message of the keys is it\u2019s governance not campaigning that counts and instead of dealing substantively with the pandemic, as we know, he thought he could talk his way out of it and that sank him.\u201d\n\nIn 2020 Lichtman gave a presentation to the American Political Science Association about the keys as one of three classic models of prediction. In recent months he has delivered keynote addresses at Asian and Brazilian financial conferences, the Oxford Union and JP Morgan. As another election looms, he is not impressed by polls that show Trump leading Biden, prompting a fatalistic mood to take hold in Washington DC and foreign capitals.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re mesmerised by the wrong things, which is the polls. First of all, polls six, seven months before an election have zero predictive value. They would have predicted President Michael Dukakis. They would have predicted President Jimmy Carter would have defeated Ronald Reagan, who won in a landslide; Carter was way ahead in some of the early polls.\n\n\u201cNot only are polls a snapshot but they are not predictors. They don\u2019t predict anything and there\u2019s no such thing as, \u2018if the election were held today\u2019. That\u2019s a meaningless statement.\u201d\n\nHe is likely to make his pronouncement on the 2024 presidential election in early August. He notes that Biden already has the incumbency key in his favour and, having crushed token challengers in the Democratic primary, has the contest key too. \u201cThat\u2019s two keys off the top. That means six more keys would have to fall to predict his defeat. A lot would have to go wrong for Biden to lose.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Joe Biden in the east room of the White House on 23 February 2024. Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nLichtman gives no weight to running mate picks and has never changed his forecast in the wake of a so-called \u201cOctober surprise\u201d But no predictive model is entirely immune to a black swan event.\n\nSpeaking in the week that saw a jury seated for Trump\u2019s criminal trial in New York involving a hush-money payment to a pornographic film performer, Lichtman acknowledges: \u201cKeys are based on history. They\u2019re very robust because they go all the way back retrospectively to 1860 and prospectively to 1984, so they cover enormous changes in our economy, our society, our demography, our politics.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s always possible there could be a cataclysmic enough event outside the scope of the keys that could affect the election and here we do have, for the first time, not just a former president but a major party candidate sitting in a trial and who knows if he\u2019s convicted \u2013 and there\u2019s a good chance he will be \u2013 how that might scramble things.\u201d\n\nMillions of people will be on edge on the night of 5 November. After 40 years of doing this, Lichtman will have one more reason to be anxious. \u201cIt\u2019s nerve-racking because there are a lot of people who\u2019d love to see me fail.\u201d And if he does? \u201cI\u2019m human,\u201d he admits. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean my system\u2019s wrong. Nothing is perfect in the human world.\u201d\n\nBiden v Trump: What\u2019s in store for the US and the world?\n\nOn Thursday 2 May, 3-4.15pm ET, join Tania Branigan, David Smith, Mehdi Hasan and Tara Setmayer for the inside track on the people, the ideas and the events that might shape the US election campaign.

        "text": "Biden's 13th-Quarter Approval Average Lowest Historically\nWASHINGTON, D.C. -- President Joe Biden averaged 38.7% job approval during his recently completed 13th quarter in office, which began on Jan. 20 and ended April 19. None of the other nine presidents elected to their first term since Dwight Eisenhower had a lower 13th-quarter average than Biden.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nGeorge H.W. Bush had the previous low 13th-quarter average approval rating, at 41.8% in 1992. Donald Trump and Barack Obama, Biden\u2019s immediate predecessors in office, averaged 46.8% and 45.9% job approval, respectively, at the same point in their presidencies.\n\nJimmy Carter is the only other president with a sub-50% average in his 13th quarter. Three of the four prior presidents who had 13th-quarter approval averages below 50% lost their reelection bids, with Obama the exception.\n\nFour of the six presidents who were reelected -- Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush -- averaged between 51% and 55% approval during their 13th quarters. Another, Dwight Eisenhower, had the highest average for a president at this stage of his presidency, 73.2%.\n\nFrom a broader historical perspective, Biden\u2019s most recent quarterly average ranks 277th out of 314 presidential quarters in Gallup records dating to 1945. That puts it in the bottom 12% of all presidential quarters.\n\nBiden Job Approval Showing No Signs of Increasing\n\nThe latest quarterly average for Biden is technically the lowest of his presidency to date, though not meaningfully different from the previous quarter\u2019s 39.0%. After Biden averaged better than 50% approval during his first two quarters in office, his subsequent readings have been near 40%.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nDuring the 13th quarter, the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza continued, as did elevated levels of illegal crossings at the U.S. Southern border. In February, a bipartisan immigration reform bill negotiated in the Senate failed to pass. And while macroeconomic indicators, particularly job growth, remain positive, there have been signs that inflation may be increasing again. The stock market, which hit record highs during the quarter, has faltered in recent weeks.\n\nIn Gallup\u2019s latest poll, conducted April 1-22, 38% of Americans approve of the job Biden is doing, essentially unchanged from his March (40%) and February (38%) readings.\n\nBiden continues to get extraordinarily low approval ratings from Republicans -- just 2% in the latest poll -- but his rating from independents is also weak, at 33%. The vast majority of Democrats, 83%, continue to evaluate Biden\u2019s performance positively.\n\nBottom Line\n\nIn this election year, when Biden is hoping U.S. voters reward him with a second term, he is needing some positive momentum to put him in a stronger position to be reelected. However, that didn\u2019t occur during the past three months, with Americans no more positive about how Biden is doing his job than they were in his prior quarter, or for most of the past three years. This is the case even after Biden delivered his election-year State of the Union speech in March, a chance for him to sell his accomplishments directly to the American people.\n\nWith about six months remaining before Election Day, Biden stands in a weaker position than any prior incumbent, and thus faces a taller task than they did in getting reelected.\n\nTo stay up to date with the latest Gallup News insights and updates, follow us on X.\n\nLearn more about how the Gallup Poll Social Series works.\n\nView complete question responses and trends (PDF download).\n\n###Embeddable###",

        "text": "Joe Biden agrees to participate in presidential election debates with Donald Trump\nIf there are no unexpected forks in the road, there will be electoral debates ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November. It is a decades-old tradition, but its continuity on this occasion was up in the air. The incumbent president, Democrat Joe Biden, had been reluctant to debate his Republican rival, Donald Trump, whom he considers a danger to democracy. On Friday, however, Biden indicated his willingness to verbally spar with the former president in a radio interview.\n\nWhen the host of the show, Howard Stern, asked Biden if he was willing to debate Trump, the president replied: \u201cI am, somewhere, I don\u2019t know when. I\u2019m happy to debate him.\u201d Previously, Biden had said that Trump\u2019s conduct would be a prerequisite to whether he would agree to participate in a debate. On March 8, he was asked if he would commit to a face-to-face with the Republican candidate and replied: \u201cIt depends on his behavior.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Trump, who did not participate in the Republican primary debates, has said he would face Biden under certain conditions. His campaign managers, Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, said this month: \u201cWe have already indicated President Trump is willing to debate anytime, anyplace, and anywhere \u2014 and the time to start these debates is now.\u201d\n\nA total of 12 news organizations issued a joint statement on April 14 calling on the presidential candidates to agree to hold debates during the campaign for the upcoming November 5 presidential election.\n\n\u201cGeneral election debates have a rich tradition in our American democracy, having played a vital role in every presidential election of the past 50 years, dating to 1976,\u2033 the news organizations\u2019 release said. \u201cIn each of those elections, tens of millions have tuned in to watch the candidates debating side by side, in a competition of ideas for the votes of American citizens.\u201d\n\nSince 1988, the nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates has sponsored every general election presidential debate. It has already set dates for three meetings between the White House candidates and one for the vice-presidential nominees, but it is too early to tell whether they will take place.\n\nThree proposed debates\n\nAccording to the commission\u2019s proposal, the first presidential debate would take place on September 16 at Texas State University in San Marcos. The second would be held on October 1 at Virginia State University in Petersburg, and the third on October 9 at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. Between the first and the second debate between the presidential candidates, one between Kamala Harris and Trump\u2019s as-yet undecided running mate would be staged on September 25 at Lafayette College, in Easton (Pennsylvania). The committee has yet to decide on the format and moderators if these dates are confirmed. All debates would begin at 9 p.m. Eastern Time and last 90 minutes, without a commercial break.\n\n\u201cThough it is too early for invitations to be extended to any candidates, it is not too early for candidates who expect to meet the eligibility criteria to publicly state their support for \u2014 and their intention to participate in \u2014 the Commission\u2019s debates planned for this fall,\u201d the news organizations noted in their release in a statement underwritten by ABC, Associated Press, CBS, CNN, C-SPAN, Fox News, NBCUniversal, NewsNation, Univision, NPR, PBS, and USA Today.\n\n\u201cIf there is one thing Americans can agree on during this polarized time, it is that the stakes of this election are exceptionally high. Amidst that backdrop, there is simply no substitute for the candidates debating with each other, and before the American people, their visions for the future of our nation,\u201d they concluded.\n\nThe Republican National Committee voted in 2022 to stop participating in debates staged by the commission. Campaign officials contend that in 2020 the commission selected an \u201cavowedly anti-Trump moderator,\u201d then-Fox News host Chris Wallace. The former president also reported a technical problem with his microphone during a 2016 debate and criticized the decision to cancel a third debate with Biden in 2020, after Trump tested positive for Covid and refused to participate virtually. The Trump campaign also wants the schedule moved up, arguing that many Americans will have already voted by the time the commission\u2019s proposed dates arrive.\n\nDuring the 2020 election campaign, at the height of the pandemic, there were two debates. In the first, in Cleveland (Ohio), Biden was visibly upset with his opponent in a chaotic debate in which Trump interrupted him 35 times during his turn to speak. The moderator called Trump to order up to 13 times, and at one point Biden said in exasperation: \u201cWill you shut up, man?\u201d The second debate took place in Nashville (Tennessee) and was somewhat less heated.\n\nSign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PA\u00cdS USA Edition",

Statement from Chioma Chukwu, American Oversight interim Executive Director: \"The Arizona Attorney General\u2019s indictments are a vital step in holding accountable those who sought to interfere in the foundations of our democracy\"",
        "text": "American Oversight Statement on Arizona Election Interference Indictments\nToday, nonpartisan public records watchdog American Oversight released the following statement on the recent indictments in Arizona of the state\u2019s fake electors and several others involved in the effort to overturn the 2020 election results, including Christina Bobb, Rudy Giuliani, and Mark Meadows.\n\nStatement from Chioma Chukwu, American Oversight interim Executive Director:\n\n\u201cThe Arizona Attorney General\u2019s indictments are a vital step in holding accountable those who sought to interfere in the foundations of our democracy: the peaceful transfer of power and the right to vote.\n\n\u201cAmerican Oversight\u2019s investigations have revealed the extent to which the election denial movement has evolved since the failed electors plot, and how several of those indicted \u2014 including the RNC\u2019s top \u2018election integrity\u2019 lawyer \u2014 remained integral to efforts to undermine the results of the 2020 election long after Jan. 6. As we approach another presidential election, our democracy will depend on ensuring that these and other individuals who\u2019ve sought to overturn our free and fair elections are forced to answer for their dangerous and anti-democratic actions.\u201d\n\nAmerican Oversight first obtained and published the fake electoral certificates from seven states in 2021. The organization\u2019s investigations of the election denial movement and post-2020 efforts to undermine confidence in U.S. elections revealed important details about the involvement of several of the Arizona defendants and unindicted co-conspirators, including Christina Bobb, who was recently named the Republican National Committee\u2019s senior counsel for \u201celection integrity.\u201d\n\nAmerican Oversight\u2019s litigation and investigation of the Arizona Senate\u2019s partisan \u201caudit\u201d of Maricopa County\u2019s election results uncovered records showing Bobb had provided Senate President Karen Fann with supposed evidence of voter fraud in December 2020 at the request of Rudy Giuliani .\n\nBobb frequently communicated with Arizona \u201caudit\u201d leaders, and in August 2021 asked to share Fann\u2019s contact information with attorney Michael Gableman, who at the time was conducting the Wisconsin Assembly\u2019s bogus election investigation.\n\nSeveral of those indicted in Arizona were indicted in Georgia\u2019s election interference case, including Giuliani, Eastman, Mark Meadows, Jenna Ellis, and Michael Roman. A guide to public records obtained by American Oversight that shed light on the election denial activities of the Georgia defendants and the unindicted co-conspirators in the Justice Department\u2019s election case is available here.\n\nIn addition to information about Giuliani\u2019s early influence in the effort to dig up supposed evidence of fraud in Arizona, American Oversight\u2019s \u201caudit\u201d investigation also uncovered documents showing that Fann appeared to have spoken with pro-Trump lawyer John Eastman in December 2020 about his theory that the Constitution allowed state legislatures to interfere with the selection of presidential electors. Email records previously reported on by Rolling Stone show that lawyer Jenna Ellis was included on a message about a post-election proposal to eliminate some ballots from the vote totals. Former Trump campaign aide Mike Roman was also heavily involved in the Arizona \u201caudit,\u201d both operationally and as a fundraiser. Other records include references to Mark Meadows \u2019 visit to Cobb County, Ga., to observe a ballot audit, as well as an email to Meadows from Trump-allied lawyer Cleta Mitchell about the Trump campaign\u2019s post-election plans in Georgia.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, American Oversight has uncovered documents related to the election denial activities of the Arizona case\u2019s unindicted co-conspirators, including former state Sen. Kelly Townsend, former state Rep. Mark Finchem, and attorney Jack Wilenchik.",

        "text": "Blinken tells CNN the US has seen evidence of China attempting to influence upcoming US elections\nBeijing CNN \u2014\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the US has seen evidence of Chinese attempts to \u201cinfluence and arguably interfere\u201d with the upcoming US elections, despite an earlier commitment from leader Xi Jinping not to do so.\n\nBlinken made the comments to CNN\u2019s Kylie Atwood in an interview Friday at the close of a three-day to trip to China, where the top American diplomat spent hours meeting with top Chinese officials including Xi, as the two countries navigated a raft of contentious issues from US tech controls to Beijing\u2019s support for Moscow.\n\nBlinken said he repeated a message President Joe Biden gave to Xi during their summit in San Francisco last November not to interfere in the 2024 US presidential elections. Then, Xi had pledged that that China would not do so, according to CNN reporting.\n\n\u201cWe have seen, generally speaking, evidence of attempts to influence and arguably interfere, and we want to make sure that that\u2019s cut off as quickly as possible,\u201d Blinken said when asked whether China was violating Xi\u2019s commitment to Biden so far.\n\n\u201cAny interference by China in our election is something that we\u2019re looking very carefully at and is totally unacceptable to us, so I wanted to make sure that they heard that message again,\u201d Blinken said, adding there was concern about China and other countries playing on existing social divisions in the US in influence campaigns.\n\nBeijing has repeatedly said it does not interfere in US elections, based on its principle of non-interference in other countries\u2019 internal affairs. China or actors that are believed to be affiliated with Beijing have been accused of political interference in other countries, such as Canada.\n\nBlinken\u2019s trip \u2014 his second to the country in less than a year \u2014 is the latest in a string of high-level engagements that culminated in the Biden-Xi summit late last year and that have seen the two countries start to expand what had been severely diminished bilateral communications.\n\n\u201cWe are (now) focused on areas where we\u2019re working to cooperate, but also we\u2019re being very forthright about our differences and that\u2019s important if we\u2019re going to avoid the competition we\u2019re in turning into conflict,\u201d Blinken told CNN.\n\nWarning on support for Russia\n\nBlinken also said he used his meeting to raise the Biden administration\u2019s concerns about China\u2019s support for Russia\u2019s defense industrial base \u2013 and to stress that further action would be taken by the US on top of existing sanctions on more than 100 Chinese entities and individuals if such support continues.\n\nThe US believes that Chinese support is enabling Russia to ramp up production of tanks, munitions and armored vehicles \u2013 and to continue its onslaught on Ukraine.\n\n\u201cWhat we said to China is this \u2013 we\u2019re going to take actions we already have, and if it doesn\u2019t stop, we\u2019re going to have to take more action, and you can anticipate as well, that other countries will (too),\u201d Blinken said, adding that he raised the issue to both Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Xi. \u201cWe\u2019re looking to them to act, and \u2026 if they don\u2019t, we will.\u201d\n\nHe also said that Chinese counterparts had not acknowledged the role of these goods in the war in Ukraine. Instead, they characterized this as trade with Russia and said Moscow\u2019s success didn\u2019t depend on China, Blinken added.\n\nBeijing has previously slammed the US as making \u201cgroundless accusations\u201d over \u201cnormal trade and economic exchanges\u201d between China and Russia.\n\nChina has long contended that it maintains neutrality in the Ukraine war and has continued to present itself as a potential peace broker in the conflict, even as it has strengthened its economic, strategic and diplomatic ties with Russia since the war began.\n\nDefending the right to protest\n\nBlinken also defended the American right to protest, when asked about pro-Palestinian protests that have erupted across college campuses in the US in recent days amid mounting concern about the humanitarian crisis unfolding in Gaza.\n\nResponding to a question referencing reports of use of antisemitic rhetoric at some of these gatherings, Blinken said there had been instances where there have been clear expressions of antisemitism, but \u201cprotests in and of themselves are not antisemitic.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re also seeing is people, young people, people from different walks of life, who do feel very passionately, who\u2019ve had very strong emotions about (the conflict),\u201d he said.\n\nHe also stressed the importance of such expression in democracies, without explicitly noting the lack of such freedoms in China.\n\n\u201cIn our country, and in our society and in our democracy, giving expression to that is, of course, something that\u2019s both appropriate and protected,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve certainly seen instances where that has clearly veered from a totally legitimate expression of views and beliefs, to in some instances, yes, clear expressions of antisemitism.\u201d\n\nBlinken said that the administration listens to the American people and \u201ctakes their views into account.\u201d But he did not explain how the protestors concerns would impact Biden administration policy.\n\nAsked if the administration would consider stopping sending weaponry to Israel, because that is what some of the protestors are calling for, he said no.\n\n\u201cNo we are focused on what\u2019s in the interests of the United States. How do we best reflect both our interests and our values in our foreign policy across the board, whether that\u2019s with Israel, or with any anyone else,\u201d Blinken said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Reporter asks Blinken if pro-Palestinian protests in US will affect policy 02:13 - Source: CNN\n\nEnding the war in Gaza\n\nWhen asked about resolving the conflict in Gaza, Blinken said it was on Hamas to decide if they are going to allow a ceasefire to go forward or not, after the militant group refused to agree to multiple possible deals.\n\nHe also said tensions in the wider region seemed to be alleviating following apparent tit-for-tat airstrikes between Iran and Israel earlier this month that ratcheted fears that the war in Gaza could expand into a wider conflagration.\n\n\u201cI think now, hopefully we are not seeing that kind of escalation,\u201d Blinken said, explaining that Hamas might have been looking at that escalation when it rejected Israel\u2019s hostage proposal.\n\nBlinken also said it could be possible to roll out a framework for the normalization of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia along with a two-state solution proposal for Israel and the Palestinians before a Gaza ceasefire in place, marking a reversal in the order of events that US officials had previously expected to follow.\n\n\u201cCertainly that\u2019s, that\u2019s possible,\u201d Blinken said. \u201cCeasefire or not we\u2019ll continue to make these possibilities known. But in order to actually realize this, there\u2019s going to have to be an end of the conflict in Gaza. And as I said, there\u2019s also going to have to be a resolution to the Palestinian question, or at least an agreement on how to resolve it.\u201d\n\nPreviously US officials said that the ongoing negotiations to secure a ceasefire had to reach an agreement before any further regional efforts could manifest.\n\nReferencing the countries that came to Israel\u2019s defense after Iran launched its April 13 aerial attack, Blinken said you could \u201csee a path in the future where Israel is genuinely integrated in the region, where other countries are helping to make sure it\u2019s defended.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut that also requires that (the conflict in) Gaza come to an end, and that there be a clear pathway to a Palestinian state. In that kind of future, Israel gets what it has sought from the start of its existence, which is normal relations with countries in the region,\u201d he said.\n\nBlinken cited the sustained US efforts to work towards normalizing relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia as part of a potentially reach a historic agreement to bring the Israel-Hamas war to an end.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been working intensively to flesh it out, working with our partners, working \u2013 with European partners on this as well. And I think the more concrete it becomes, and the more it moves from the hypothetical and theoretical to something that\u2019s actually possible, that\u2019s real, then everyone involved is actually going to have to make decisions and make choices. And so we\u2019re doing this work. And we\u2019re trying to make it as real as possible,\u201d Blinken said.\n\nCNN\u2019s Jennifer Hansler contributed reporting.",

The Board will advise the Secretary, the critical infrastructure community, other private sector stakeholders, and the broader public on the safe and secure development and deployment of AI technology in our nation\u2019s critical infrastructure. The Board will develop recommendations to help critical infrastructure stakeholders, such as transportation service providers, pipeline and power grid operators, and internet service providers, more responsibly leverage AI technologies. It will also develop recommendations to prevent and prepare for AI-related disruptions to critical services that impact national or economic security, public health, or safety.\n\nPresident Biden directed Secretary Alejandro N. Mayorkas to establish the Board, which includes 22 representatives from a range of sectors, including software and hardware companies, critical infrastructure operators, public officials, the civil rights community, and academia. The inaugural members of the Board are:\n\nSam Altman, CEO, OpenAI;\n\nDario Amodei, CEO and Co-Founder, Anthropic;\n\nEd Bastian, CEO, Delta Air Lines;\n\nRumman Chowdhury, Ph.D., CEO, Humane Intelligence;\n\nAlexandra Reeve Givens, President and CEO, Center for Democracy and Technology\n\nBruce Harrell, Mayor of Seattle, Washington; Chair, Technology and Innovation Committee, United States Conference of Mayors;\n\nDamon Hewitt, President and Executive Director, Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law;\n\nVicki Hollub, President and CEO, Occidental Petroleum;\n\nJensen Huang, President and CEO, NVIDIA;\n\nArvind Krishna, Chairman and CEO, IBM;\n\nFei-Fei Li, Ph.D., Co-Director, Stanford Human-centered Artificial Intelligence Institute;\n\nWes Moore, Governor of Maryland;\n\nSatya Nadella, Chairman and CEO, Microsoft;\n\nShantanu Narayen, Chair and CEO, Adobe;\n\nSundar Pichai, CEO, Alphabet;\n\nArati Prabhakar, Ph.D., Assistant to the President for Science and Technology; Director, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy;\n\nChuck Robbins, Chair and CEO, Cisco; Chair, Business Roundtable;\n\nAdam Selipsky, CEO, Amazon Web Services;\n\nDr. Lisa Su, Chair and CEO, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD);\n\nNicol Turner Lee, Ph.D., Senior Fellow and Director of the Center for Technology Innovation, Brookings Institution;\n\nKathy Warden, Chair, CEO and President, Northrop Grumman; and\n\nMaya Wiley, President and CEO, The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.\n\nDHS is responsible for the overall security and resilience of the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure, which hundreds of millions of Americans rely on every day to light their homes, conduct business, exchange information, and put food on the table. Critical infrastructure encompasses sixteen sectors of American industry, including our defense, energy, agriculture, transportation, and internet technology sectors. The Board will advise DHS on ensuring the safe and responsible deployment of AI technology in these sectors in the years to come, and it will look to address threats posed by this technology to these vital services.\n\n\u201cArtificial Intelligence is a transformative technology that can advance our national interests in unprecedented ways. At the same time, it presents real risks\u2014 risks that we can mitigate by adopting best practices and taking other studied, concrete actions,\u201d said Secretary Mayorkas. \u201cI am grateful that such accomplished leaders are dedicating their time and expertise to the Board to help ensure our nation\u2019s critical infrastructure\u2014the vital services upon which Americans rely every day\u2014effectively guards against the risks and realizes the enormous potential of this transformative technology.\u201d\n\nSecretary Mayorkas selected these experts to develop multifaceted, cross-sector approaches to pressing issues surrounding the benefits and risks of this emerging technology. It will convene for the first time in Early May with subsequent meetings planned quarterly. At the outset, the Board will: 1) provide the Secretary and the critical infrastructure community with actionable recommendations to ensure the safe adoption of AI technology in the essential services Americans depend upon every day, and 2) create a forum for DHS, the critical infrastructure community, and AI leaders to share information on the security risks presented by AI.\n\nThe Board will help DHS stay ahead of evolving threats posed by hostile nation-state actors and reinforce our national security by helping to deter and prevent those threats. The DHS Homeland Threat Assessment of 2024 warns the public of the threat AI-assisted tools pose to our economic security and critical infrastructure, including how these technologies \u201chave the potential to enable larger scale, faster, efficient, and more evasive cyber attacks\u2014against targets, including pipelines, railways, and other US critical infrastructure.\u201d It also concludes that nation states, including the People\u2019s Republic of China, are developing \u201cother AI technologies that could undermine U.S. cyber defenses, including generative AI programs that support malicious activity such as malware attacks.\u201d\n\nShantanu Narayen, Chair & CEO, Adobe: \u201cAdobe is honored to be a part of the Artificial Intelligence Safety and Security Board to share learnings and recommendations with Secretary Mayorkas and key stakeholders across the public and private sectors. This Board holds enormous potential to advance AI technology, establishing guidelines that will help AI enhance and secure our nation\u2019s critical infrastructure while mitigating any risks it could pose.\u201d\n\nDr. Lisa Su, Chair and CEO, Advanced Micro Devices: \u201cThe widespread use of AI has the potential to improve every aspect of our daily lives. It is critical that we work across the public and private sectors to adopt a collaborative and responsible approach that will ensure we harness the incredible power of AI for good. I am honored to work alongside such an esteemed group of colleagues on this important issue.\u201d\n\nAdam Selipsky, CEO, Amazon Web Services: \u201cAs one of the world\u2019s leading developers and deployers of AI tools and services, AWS supports fostering the safe, secure, and responsible development of AI technology. We appreciate the opportunity to serve as an inaugural member of the Artificial Intelligence Safety and Security Board, and we are committed to continued collaboration with policymakers, industry, researchers, critical infrastructure providers, and the AI community to advance the responsible and secure use of AI.\u201d\n\nDario Amodei, CEO and Co-Founder, Anthropic: \u201cAI technology is capable of offering immense benefits to society if deployed responsibly, which is why we\u2019ve advocated for efforts to test the safety of frontier AI systems to mitigate potential risks. We\u2019re proud to contribute to studying the implications of AI on protecting critical infrastructure with other leaders in the public and private sectors. Safe AI deployment is paramount to securing infrastructure that powers American society, and we believe the formation of this board is a positive step forward in strengthening U.S. national security.\u201d\n\nChuck Robbins, Chair and CEO, Cisco; Chair, Business Roundtable: \u201cAI must be as safe, secure, and responsible as it is revolutionary. This collective effort underscores the importance of deploying AI innovations in a manner that safeguards our nation\u2019s critical infrastructure. I look forward to working with Secretary Mayorkas and other members of the Board to strengthen American resilience in today\u2019s rapidly evolving threat landscape.\u201d\n\nEd Bastian, CEO, Delta Air Lines: \u201cBy driving innovative tools like crew resourcing and turbulence prediction, AI is already making significant contributions to the reliability of our nation\u2019s air travel system, and it promises to further transform the travel experience in the years ahead. I\u2019m honored to serve on this board, which will help ensure that this technology is developed and deployed safely and securely without disrupting vital transportation infrastructure or millions of critical transportation jobs nationwide.\u201d\n\nRumman Chowdhury, Ph.D., CEO, Humane Intelligence: \u201cGrappling with the implications of Artificial intelligence on critical infrastructure is necessary to ensure equitable and tangible benefits of this technology to all Americans. Humane Intelligence is looking forward to engaging on these timely issues.\u201d\n\nArvind Krishna, Chairman and CEO, IBM: \u201cArtificial intelligence is a game-changing technology that is making businesses smarter, stronger, and safer. AI\u2019s ability to analyze threat information at scale can help protect the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure from cyberattacks, an imperative that I look forward to advancing as a member of the AI Safety and Security Board.\u201d\n\nMaya Wiley, President and CEO, The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights: \u201cIt is critical to have a civil rights perspective on any board with the mission to responsibly deploy artificial intelligence in our nation\u2019s infrastructure. Critical infrastructure plays a key role ensuring everyone has equal access to information, goods, and services. It also poses great threats, including the spread of bias and hate speech online, stoking fear, distrust, and hate in our communities of color. I am looking forward to joining my colleagues as we discuss the ethical deployment of AI across our critical infrastructure to promote and protect the civil and human rights of every person in the United States.\u201d\n\nSatya Nadella, Chairman and CEO, Microsoft: \u201cArtificial Intelligence is the most transformative technology of our time, and we must ensure it is deployed safely and responsibly. Microsoft is honored to participate in this important effort and looks forward to sharing both our learnings to date, and our plans going forward. We thank Secretary Mayorkas for including us in this important endeavor and look forward to the continued partnership.\u201d\n\nFei-Fei Li, Ph.D., Co-Director, Stanford Human-centered Artificial Intelligence Institute: \u201cI\u2019m honored to join this group of interdisciplinary leaders to steward this world-changing technology responsibly and in a human-centered way. Ultimately AI is a tool, a potent tool, and it must be developed and applied with an understanding of how it will impact the individual, community, and society at large.\u201d\n\nBruce Harrell, Mayor of Seattle, Washington and Chair, Technology and Innovation Committee, United States Conference of Mayors: \u201cAdvancement in artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies offer significant opportunities to transform our society and world. Civic, business, academic, and philanthropic partners have a responsibility to foster this innovation in a way that ensures the development, deployment, and use of these technologies is safe, secure, and ethical. I am honored to serve alongside leaders who share a commitment to leverage technological advancements to address our greatest challenges and capitalize on our greatest opportunities. Together, this Board will advance critical work to safeguard critical infrastructure from real threats and to meet the dynamic needs of today and the future.\u201d\n\nArati Prabhakar, Assistant to the President for Science and Technology; Director, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy: \u201cAI is one of the most powerful technologies of our time. President Biden has made clear that we must manage AI\u2019s risks so that we can seize its benefits. Thanks to Secretary Mayorkas for taking action to protect America\u2019s critical infrastructure\u2014our energy system, banking, health care, and communications\u2014from AI risks and harms.\u201d\n\nThe launch of the Board is a keystone of wide-ranging efforts within DHS to respond to the rapid emergence of AI technology. In March 2024, DHS debuted its first \u201cArtificial Intelligence Roadmap,\u201d which details the Department\u2019s 2024 plans to responsibly leverage AI to advance homeland security missions while protecting individuals\u2019 privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties; promote nationwide AI safety and security; and, continue to lead in AI through strong cohesive partnership.\n\nThe Department\u2019s latest efforts follow President Biden\u2019s Executive Order (EO), \u201cSafe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence,\u201d signed in October 2023. In the EO, the President directed Secretary Mayorkas to establish the AI Safety and Security Board to support the responsible development of AI. The President also directed DHS to promote the adoption of AI safety standards globally, protect U.S. networks and critical infrastructure, reduce the risks that AI can be used to create weapons of mass destruction, combat AI-related intellectual property theft, and help the United States attract and retain skilled talent, among other missions.\n\nTo accelerate the deployment of AI and machine learning technologies throughout the Department, Secretary Mayorkas announced in February the Department\u2019s first-ever hiring sprint to recruit 50 experts to better leverage these technologies across strategic areas of the homeland security enterprise. These include efforts to counter fentanyl, combat child sexual exploitation and abuse, deliver immigration services, secure travel, fortify our critical infrastructure, and enhance our cybersecurity. DHS has received over 4,000 applications to date and is in the process of reviewing and hiring AI technologists to support mission-enhancing initiatives.\n\nThe Department continues to accept applications at https://www.dhs.gov/ai/join.\n\nIn April 2023, DHS established the Department\u2019s first AI Task Force and named Eric Hysen its first Chief AI Officer. The Task Force\u2019s focus is on DHS\u2019s entire mission space. For example, it is working to enhance the integrity of our supply chains and the broader trade environment by helping deploy AI to improve cargo screening, the identification of imported goods produced with forced labor, and risk management. Secretary Mayorkas also charged the Task Force with using AI to better detect fentanyl shipments, identify and interdict the flow of precursor chemicals around the world, and disrupt key nodes in criminal networks.\n\nTo learn more about how DHS uses AI technologies to protect the homeland, visit the Artificial Intelligence at DHS webpage.\n\n###",

        "text": "China's influence operations against the U.S. are bigger than TikTok\nChina's influence operations against the U.S. are bigger than TikTok\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Joe Raedle/Getty Images Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nA new law passed this week would ban TikTok in the United States unless ByteDance, its Chinese owner, sells the popular video app.\n\nNational security is at the heart of bipartisan concerns in Washington motivating the law. Lawmakers say they're worried the Chinese government could lean on ByteDance in order to use TikTok to suck up Americans' data, surveil them, and spread false and misleading claims to U.S. voters.\n\n\"It's not hard to imagine how a platform that facilitates so much commerce, political discourse and social debate could be covertly manipulated to serve the goals of an authoritarian regime,\" Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., said this week.\n\nMany lawmakers who supported the bill said classified intelligence briefings have raised alarms about TikTok \u2014 but have not yet made that information available for public scrutiny. Some members of Congress have pushed back, including Sen. Edward Markey of Massachusetts, who said while he has concerns about many social networks' collection of user data, he had seen \"no credible evidence\" that TikTok presents a threat just because its parent company is based in China.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nSo what do we know about China's efforts to manipulate Americans using social media, and what role does TikTok play?\n\nChina's growing information operations\n\nWhile much of the discussion about foreign interference in elections has focused on Russia since 2016, China presents a growing threat, according to the intelligence community, tech companies and independent researchers.\n\nBeijing has stepped up its online information operations in recent years in support of its broader goals, experts say. China \"aims to sow doubts about U.S. leadership, undermine democracy, and extend Beijing's influence,\" the Office of the Director of National Intelligence wrote in its annual threat assessment earlier this year.\n\nIn past cycles, that took the form of trying to shape U.S. policy toward China. For example, in a handful of 2022 midterm races, Beijing sought to boost candidates seen as pro-China and counter those seen as opposing its interests, according to a December report from the ODNI.\n\nMore recently, those efforts have shifted to exploiting existing partisan divides in the U.S. That includes \"the Chinese actually going into U.S. audience spaces, masquerading as Americans, and posting inflammatory content around current events or social issues or political issues,\" said Clint Watts, general manager of Microsoft's Threat Analysis Center.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nResearchers at Microsoft as well as the nonprofit Institute for Strategic Dialogue have identified accounts on X, formerly known as Twitter, posing as Donald Trump supporters, attacking President Biden, and seizing on hot-button topics such as immigration. Microsoft said some accounts even seemed to be polling American voters on what issues divided them most.\n\n\"Joe Biden 'belongs in a nursing home' not the White House,\" one account posted \u2014 but the post also included Mandarin characters, apparently due to an incorrect browser setting, ISD said.\n\nOther China-linked accounts used AI-generated images to spread a baseless conspiracy theory that the U.S. government deliberately set last year's Maui wildfires to test a military \"weather weapon,\" Microsoft said.\n\nMicrosoft and ISD both linked the posts they identified to Spamouflage, a long-running Chinese network of fake accounts across social networks including Facebook, X and TikTok. Spamouflage accounts have previously pushed attacks on pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, praised China's COVID-19 response, and posted videos with AI-generated news anchors promoting Chinese leadership.\n\nLast year, Facebook owner Meta said Spamouflage is the largest covert influence operation it's ever disrupted \u2014 and linked it to Chinese law enforcement. Despite their breadth, however, these efforts have failed to gain many followers or have significant impact.\n\n\"The vast scale of Spamouflage has previously been offset by its ineffectual tactics and uncompelling content; if the operators find a strategy which works, potentially augmented by generative AI, it could start to become a real problem,\" wrote Elise Thomas, ISD senior analyst.\n\nTikTok has been used in these publicly identified Chinese operations, but researchers say they have not seen a particular focus on the app that goes beyond other popular platforms such as Facebook, Instagram and YouTube. (TikTok is also difficult for researchers to access.)\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Annabelle Chih/Getty Images Annabelle Chih/Getty Images\n\nChina's information campaign against Taiwan\n\nOne place where China has more aggressively attempted to use TikTok to influence politics is Taiwan, which held its own presidential election in January.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAs in the U.S., China's goal is to undermine democracy, said Chihhao Yu, co-director of the Taiwan Information Environment Research Center (IORG).\n\nHe said the strategy is to \"create an alternative worldview for Mandarin readers in Taiwan, of course, but also around the world for Mandarin-speaking communities.\"\n\nYu's group has found what it calls proxy accounts on TikTok and YouTube that share videos identical to those posted on official state-controlled accounts on Douyin, China's version of TikTok, without any disclosure of their origins. Sometimes the videos even appear on TikTok before they are posted to the official Douyin accounts.\n\n\"That is saying that the [Chinese government] does not necessarily need its official footprint on TikTok to have an influence on TikTok,\" Yu said.\n\nOther researchers in Taiwan have identified TikTok influencers who appear to be using the same scripts to talk about divisive issues like migrant workers. Some influencers who typically post videos about fashion and beauty posted seemingly scripted videos alleging election fraud.\n\nStill, there's no suggestion that the Chinese government was coordinating with ByteDance in its use of TikTok influencers and proxy accounts.\n\nAnd ultimately, these efforts to sway Taiwanese voters were unsuccessful: The incumbent pro-independence candidate opposed by Beijing won reelection.",

        "text": "Maine draws a line in the Sandhills: Will match Nebraska on winner-take-all \u2022 Nebraska Examiner\nOMAHA \u2014 If red-led Nebraska holds a special session this summer and decides to award its five Electoral College votes to the statewide winner of the presidential vote, then blue-led Maine will match it, canceling any advantage for former President Donald Trump.\n\nMaine House Majority Leader Maureen Terry issued a statement Friday saying that local voters \u201cvalue their independence, but they also value fairness and playing by the rules.\u201d She said Maine would not let others game the system.\n\n\u201cIf Nebraska\u2019s Republican governor and Republican-controlled Legislature were to change their electoral system this late in the cycle in order to unfairly award Donald Trump an additional electoral vote, I think the Maine Legislature would be compelled to act,\u201d she said in a statement she confirmed to the Examiner.\n\nNebraska and Maine are the only two states that split some of their electoral votes for president. They award a single electoral vote to the winner in each congressional district and send the remaining votes to the statewide winner.\n\nSpecial session update\n\nCornhusker State Gov. Jim Pillen said he would call a special session if state lawmakers could find the 33 votes needed to overcome a filibuster or the 30 votes needed to suspend legislative rules and pass the change with fewer votes.\n\nPillen and other Republicans in the officially nonpartisan Unicameral Legislature have faced outside pressure from Trump supporters to make the change, including from populist conservative talk show host Charlie Kirk, known for his political group Turning Point USA.\n\nKirk argued during a recent rally in Omaha that allowing the 2nd District a chance to vote Democratic could tilt the election from Trump to Biden. He urged his supporters to call and write to their state senators and call for the change.\n\nTrump himself lobbied at least one Nebraska lawmaker for winner-take-all, State Sen. Tom Brewer, who represents north-central Nebraska, although Trump\u2019s campaign denied it.\n\nSenators\u2019 office phones and emails lit up, overwhelming staff.\n\nDon\u2019t have the votes\n\nOne Republican senator, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the measure does not have \u201canywhere close to 33 votes\u201d to pass and said the outside pressure was costing the measure votes. Speaker John Arch had no immediate comment.\n\nState Sen. Loren Lippincott of Central City, the sponsor of this year\u2019s winner-take-all proposal, Legislative Bill 764, said he does not yet know if a special session on that issue will happen. He said he hopes to hear something next week.\n\n\u201cWe have to wait and see if Governor Pillen wants to address Winner Take All in a special session,\u201d he said.\n\nPillen\u2019s office had no update on a possible special session.\n\nLippincott said supporters of winner-take-all in Nebraska want to make the change regardless of what Maine does. Republican supporters of switching have argued that it dilutes Nebraska\u2019s influence nationally and should be standardized.\n\nSome argue current system more fair\n\nOthers, including Democrats in the Legislature, have argued that the unusual way Nebraska and Maine award electoral votes ensures that at least one part of Nebraska gets more attention from presidential candidates and campaigns than it otherwise would.\n\nStatewide, Nebraska has voted Republican in every presidential election since Lyndon Johnson in 1964. But the Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District has swung to Democrats twice, in 2008 for President Barack Obama and in 2020 for President Joe Biden.\n\nMaine has similarly voted Democratic since 1988, when part-time Kennebunkport resident George H.W. Bush won the state and its four electoral votes. But Maine\u2019s rural 2nd District sent an electoral vote to Republicans in 2016 and 2020.\n\nThe Nebraska Republican Party has supported moving back to winner-take-all since the idea passed in 1991. The new populist party leadership had no immediate comment, but it has been vocal in its support of Trump and hopeful of helping his campaign.\n\nNebraska Democratic Party chair Jane Kleeb said Nebraska remains \u201cproud of our split electoral vote system that brings fairness and competition to the state.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump and his online bullies failed to change our system this year, and even if they got their way Maine would make that move null and void,\u201d she said in response to a reporter\u2019s question. \u201cSo how about we all compete at the doors to win over voters rather than change the rules this close to an election?\u201d",

His actions and the actions of others disrupted a joint session of the U.S. Congress convened to ascertain and count the electoral votes related to the 2020 presidential election.\n\nJohn Earle Sullivan, 29, of Salt Lake City, Utah, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth to 72 months in prison, 36 months of supervised release, and ordered to pay $2,000 in restitution.\n\nSullivan was found guilty by a federal jury of felony offenses of obstructing an official proceeding, obstructing officers during a civil disorder, entering or remaining in a restricted building or grounds with a dangerous weapon, disorderly or disruptive conduct in a restricted building or grounds with a dangerous weapon, and unlawful possession of a dangerous weapon on Capitol grounds or buildings on Nov. 16, 2023. In addition to the felonies, the jury also found Sullivan guilty of misdemeanor offenses of disorderly or disruptive conduct in a Capitol building and parading, demonstrating, or picketing in a Capitol building.\n\nAccording to court documents, in the days and weeks leading to the events of Jan. 6, 2021, Sullivan used various digital platforms and personas to present himself as an activist; however, on these platforms, Sullivan made his true objectives clear: to cause pure chaos and disruption to the status quo. Sullivan alternated between advertising legitimate protests and broadcasting violent anti-establishment rhetoric.\n\nIn the winter of 2020, Sullivan began advocating for a violent government dismantling. In one Instagram post, Sullivan wrote, \"We will have live updates on the location for tonight's purge. Spread the message. Let the electoral purge commence.\" On Jan. 2, 2021, Sullivan tweeted, \"F\u2014 The System-Time To Burn It All Down,\" with an accompanying still from a TikTok video of him burning an American flag. Sullivan also made it clear he knew the significance of what would be occurring that day\u2014both the certification and the rally. Sullivan made and posted a video explaining the details of the certification process. On Dec. 30, 2020, Sullivan wrote, \"Definitely don't surround his house\u2026\" with a photo of Senator Mitch McConnell.\n\nOn Jan. 6, 2021, Sullivan, fitted with a ballistic vest, gas mask, and bull horn, joined rioters storming the U.S. Capitol. Sullivan joined the crowd pushing through several police barriers on the west side of the Capitol grounds, using the bull horn to encourage others statements like \u201cGet in that s\u2014, let\u2019s go! Move, Move, Move! Storm that s\u2014!\u201d As Sullivan and the others approached the Capitol building, Sullivan can be heard in his video saying at various points: \"There are so many people. Let's go. This s\u2014 is ours! F\u2014 yeah,\" \"We accomplished this s\u2014. We did this s\u2014 together. F\u2014 yeah!\" \"We are all a part of this f\u2014ing history,\" and \"Let's burn this s\u2014 down.\"\n\nOn the Upper West Terrace of the Capitol, Sullivan triumphantly put his hand above his head and let out several celebratory whoops. Sullivan assisted a rioter scale the wall of the Upper West Terrace, calling the feat \u201cawesome\u201d and \u201csavage.\u201d Before entering, Sullivan told his companion that he would continue to film as \u201ca good ploy\u201d so he would not get arrested after entering the building.\n\nAt approximately 2:15 p.m., Sullivan entered the Capitol via a smashed window next to the broken Senate Wing Door and, once inside, roamed the building with other individuals who had unlawfully entered. During an interaction with another, Sullivan can be heard in the video saying, \"We gotta get this s\u2014 burned,\" \"It's our house m\u2014f\u2014,\" and \"We are getting this s\u2014.\" In multiple locations, Sullivan ignored law enforcement commands to leave and told the officers to stand down so they would not get hurt.\n\nAt approximately 2:28 p.m., Sullivan joined the growing crowd outside the House of Representatives, working his way up to the front where he was stopped by Capitol Police. Members, staff, and press were present inside the House of Representatives during this time. Sullivan encouraged other rioters, explaining he was \"ready\" because he had \"been in so many riots.\" When rioters told the crowd at the House Chamber door not to be violent and to be peaceful, Sullivan responded, \"They don't listen without that s\u2014,\" \"F\u2014 that s\u2014,\" and later told the crowd to \"pull that m-f\u2014er out this b\u2014.\" Sullivan told the other members of the crowd that he had a knife and held it up to the crowd outside the House Main Doors. The FBI would later determine that the knife was a Smith & Wesson M&P knife with a 3.74\u201d blade.\n\nAfter unsuccessful attempts to access the House floor, the crowd, including Sullivan, made their way to the Speaker\u2019s Lobby, where the evacuation of the House floor was actively underway. Sullivan, once again telling the mob he had a knife, positioned himself at the front of the Speaker's Lobby crowd as the crowd began to break the doors' glass windows. Sullivan encouraged those attempting to break the windows to \"Go, go. Let\u2019s go. Get that s\u2014!\" After the windows were broken out, a woman climbed through, resulting in her being shot. Members, staff, and press were still present in the House gallery at this time.\n\nAfterward, Sullivan was filmed stating he brought his megaphone to \u201cinstigate s\u2014\u201d and was in favor of anyone wanting to tear the system down.\n\nThe FBI arrested Sullivan on Jan. 14, 2021, in Salt Lake City.\n\nThis case is being prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia and the Department of Justice National Security Division's Counterterrorism Section. Valuable assistance was provided by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Utah.\n\nThis case is being investigated by the FBI's Salt Lake City and Washington Field Offices. Valuable assistance was provided by the United States Capitol Police and the Metropolitan Police Department.\n\nIn the 39 months since Jan. 6, 2021, more than 1,385 individuals have been charged in nearly all 50 states for crimes related to the breach of the U.S. Capitol, including nearly 500 individuals charged with assaulting or impeding law enforcement, a felony. The investigation remains ongoing.\n\nAnyone with tips can call 1-800-CALL-FBI (800-225-5324) or visit tips.fbi.gov.",

        "text": "A growing share of Americans have little or no confidence in Netanyahu\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu waits for the start of an Israeli war cabinet meeting also attended by U.S. President Joe Biden on Oct. 18, 2023, in Tel Aviv, Israel. (Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nA majority of Americans (53%) have little or no confidence in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to do the right thing regarding world affairs, including 25% who have no confidence in him at all. Three-in-ten say they have at least some confidence in him, according to a Pew Research Center survey of 3,600 U.S. adults conducted April 1-7, 2024.\n\nThe share of Americans who have no confidence in Netanyahu has increased 11 percentage points since 2023. This includes an 8-point increase in the share who have no confidence in him at all.\n\nThis shift is related to a change in awareness of Netanyahu. In 2023, around a quarter of Americans (26%) said they had never heard of him, but that share has fallen to 15% this year.\n\nHow we did this Pew Research Center analyzed Americans\u2019 attitudes toward Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as part of our broader research about confidence in global leaders. Most of the data used in this analysis is from a survey of 3,600 U.S. adults conducted April 1-7, 2024. Data on views of the Israeli government is from a survey of 12,693 U.S. adults conducted Feb. 13-25, 2024. Everyone who took part in the April survey is a member of Pew Research Center\u2019s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. This way, nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. Read more about the ATP\u2019s methodology. Most of the respondents from the February survey (10,642) are members of Pew Research Center\u2019s American Trends Panel. The remaining 2,051 respondents are members of three other survey panels \u2013 Ipsos\u2019 KnowledgePanel, SSRS\u2019s Opinion Panel, and NORC at the University of Chicago\u2019s AmeriSpeak Panel \u2013 who were interviewed because they identify as Jewish or Muslim. The February survey \u201coversampled\u201d (i.e., interviewed a disproportionately large number of) Jews and Muslims to provide more reliable estimate of their views on the topics covered in the survey. But these groups are not overrepresented in the national estimates reported as we adjusted for the oversampling in the weighting of the data. Both surveys are weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education, religious affiliation and other categories. Here are the questions used for this analysis, along with responses, as well as the February survey methodology and the April survey methodology.\n\nAmericans\u2019 views of Netanyahu differ by party and by certain demographic factors:\n\nPartisanship\n\nRepublicans and Republican-leaning independents have much more positive views of Netanyahu than Democrats and Democratic leaners do. Around half of Republicans (51%) say they have at least some confidence in him to do the right thing regarding world affairs, while only 13% of Democrats say the same. Among Democrats, many more say they have no confidence in him at all (38%) than report even having some confidence in him.\n\nConservative Republicans (62%) are twice as likely as moderate and liberal Republicans (31%) to say they have at least some confidence in Netanyahu. Conservative and moderate Democrats (17%) also express more confidence than liberals (7%).\n\nThere are also age differences among partisans. For example, Republicans ages 50 and older have much more confidence in Netanyahu than younger Republicans do (69% vs. 33% have at least some confidence). Age differences are more modest among Democrats: 16% of older Democrats have confidence in the Israeli prime minister, compared with 10% of younger Democrats.\n\nAmong both Republicans and Democrats, the share expressing little or no confidence in Netanyahu has increased since last year. However, the shift among Democrats (+15 points) has been three times as large as the shift among Republicans (+5 points).\n\nAge\n\nOlder Americans are significantly more likely than younger ones to have positive views of Netanyahu. About four-in-ten Americans ages 50 and older (42%) have at least some confidence in him to do the right thing regarding world affairs. That compares with around a quarter of those ages 30 to 49 and only 13% of adults under 30.\n\nThe youngest U.S. adults have grown more negative toward Netanyahu since last year. The share of adults under 30 who have little or no confidence in Netanyahu has risen from 37% then to 55% today. This is related, in part, to the 20-point decrease in the share of young adults who say they have never heard of Netanyahu.\n\nViews of the Israeli government\n\nAmericans\u2019 views of the Israeli government have also turned more negative since 2022, according to a Center survey conducted this February. About four-in-ten Americans (41%) have a favorable view of the Israeli government, down from 47% in 2022 and on par with the share who said this in 2019. Notably, the 2022 survey was the only one to take place when Netanyahu was not in office.\n\nAs with Netanyahu, when it comes to evaluations of the Israeli government, Republicans have much more favorable views than Democrats (63% vs. 24% favorable), and older Americans have more positive views than younger ones.\n\nNote: Here are the questions used for this analysis, along with responses, as well as the February survey methodology and the April survey methodology.",

        "text": "China seeks to \u2018influence and interfere\u2019 upcoming US presidential elections, alleges Antony Blinken\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken, during the final day of his three-day visit to China, said that the US observed signs of Chinese attempts to \u201cinfluence and arguably interfere\u201d in the forthcoming US presidential elections, despite earlier assurances from Chinese President Xi Jinping to refrain from such actions, CNN reported.\n\nIn an interview with CNN on Friday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken shared his observations about Chinese attempts to influence the upcoming US elections. These comments came after he visited China, where he spent hours discussing various contentious topics with high-level Chinese officials, including President Xi Jinping. Key issues addressed during his visit included US technology controls and Beijing's support for Moscow.\n\nBlinken said he reiterated President Joe Biden's message, which he gave to Xi Jinping during their summit in San Francisco last November, to not interfere in the 2024 US presidential elections.\n\nFollowing this, Xi pledged that China would not do so. \u201cWe have seen, generally speaking, evidence of attempts to influence and arguably interfere, and we want to make sure that that's cut off as quickly as possible,\u201d Blinken said when asked whether China was violating Xi's commitment to Biden so far.\n\n\"Any interference by China in our election is something that we're looking very carefully at and is totally unacceptable to us, so I wanted to make sure that they heard that message again,\" he added.\n\nBlinken further noted that there were concerns about China and other countries playing on existing social divisions in the US in influence campaigns, as per the report.\n\nBeijing has consistently stated that it does not interfere in US elections, citing its principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other nations. However, China, or entities believed to be connected with Beijing, has faced allegations of political interference in other countries, like Canada.\n\nDespite its official stance, these allegations suggest that China's actions might not always align with its publicly stated principles.\n\nBlinken's visit to China, his second in under a year, is part of a series of high-level engagements aimed at mending relations and building on the progress achieved during the Biden-Xi summit late last year. These recent interactions indicate a gradual expansion of previously strained bilateral communications between the two countries.\n\n\u201cWe are (now) focused on areas where we're working to cooperate, but also we're being very forthright about our differences and that's important if we're going to avoid the competition we're in turning into conflict,\u201d Blinken said.",

Eisenhower began in 1952, have been strongly predictive of re-election success.\n\nHistorically, every incumbent in the past seven decades with an approval rating above 50% has won a second term. Only Barack Obama bucked the trend: his 2012 victory came despite a middling 46% approval six months ahead of that year\u2019s general election.\n\nNo first-term president in Gallup\u2019s history has returned to the White House with approval numbers as low as Biden\u2019s \u2014 whose results this quarter ranked among the worst of the post-World War II era, in the bottom 12% of all presidential quarters going back to 1945.\n\n3 Millions of migrants have entered the US thanks to Biden\u2019s lax border enforcement of immigration law \u2014 infuriating voters, surveys show. AP\n\nAnd while this quarter marks a new low for Biden in Gallup\u2019s polling, his popularity has remained stubbornly mired in the low 40s since the first year of his presidency, amid skyrocketing inflation, a worsening border crisis and the disastrous pullout from Afghanistan.\n\nHis re-election campaign has been plagued by embarrassing gaffes, and aides have struggled to shield their octogenarian boss from the press as his halting, shuffling gait offers evidence of his advanced age.\n\nYet current polls show the 2024 presidential election as a tight race, with Trump holding a 0.3% edge over Biden in the RealClearPolitics aggregate of national polls.\n\nGallup\u2019s national survey of 1,001 Americans, conducted from April 1 to April 22, has a 4-point margin of error.\n\nBiden\u2019s historic low compared to other US presidents\n\nPresident Biden\u2019s approval rating 39 months into his presidency is the lowest of any elected chief executive in modern American history, according to Gallup.",

        "text": "Opinion: The Supreme Court just showed us that Trump is not incompetent. He\u2019s a master of corruption\nDonald Trump\u2019s corruption of the United States has become so deeply rooted that he was controlling puppets on the Supreme Court while facing a criminal jury 200 miles away.\n\nI have badly underestimated Donald Trump. Thursday was the day that his justices \u2014 it turns out that they are indeed his justices on the Supreme Court, just as he claimed \u2014 got it through my thick head: Trump is not just competent but masterful. He is not just capable, he is supreme.\n\nBecause Trump is clumsy at his alleged crimes, surrounding himself with flagrant thugs, telling obvious lies, leaving prolific trails of damning evidence, offering ridiculous defenses for indefensible conduct, I had long concluded that he is incompetent at crookery along with his other manifest failings. That\u2019s true as far as it goes. But for all his mad greed and compulsive lawlessness, for all his sleaze and stupidity, crime is ultimately not Trump\u2019s game. Trump is nothing like a master criminal. But he is a master of something far more sinister and complex: corruption.\n\nCrime is a largely private endeavor. Corruption is public. It seeps into the muscle and sinew of democratic society and institutions; it devours from within. The Supreme Court, drunk on arrogated power, cut loose from rudimentary ethics , has been eaten alive by it. But the court is just one plot of a vast terrain that Trump has conquered \u2014 not with crime, but corruption.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCrime is when you launch a violent attempt to overthrow the republic. Corruption is when you convince an entire political party to pretend they didn\u2019t watch it live on television, or cower from it inside the Capitol while dozens of police officers were being bludgeoned by the mob.\n\nCrime is when you make off with top-secret documents. Corruption is when a MAGA judge can\u2019t find time to schedule your trial, or process the mountainous evidence of your guilt.\n\nCrime is when a U.S. resident is murdered and dismembered by Saudi hit men. Corruption is when the all but acknowledged killer invests $2 billion in your talentless son-in-law\u2019s fund, which other investors shun .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCrime is when you fake business expenses to cover up a payoff to an adult film actress who wants to cash in on your campaign for president. Corruption is when the head of the nation\u2019s greasiest tabloid, a perpetual fount of lies and nonsense, expresses concern that your deeds are too sleazy for him.\n\nCrime is when your lawyers tell the Senate not to convict you in an impeachment trial because you can be charged in court. Corruption is when your lawyers inform the Supreme Court that you are immune from criminal courts and only the Senate can judge you \u2014 but, alas, the senators have missed their window.\n\nTrump has already succeeded at corrupting much of what\u2019s corruptible. Government. Elections. Foreign policy. Democracy. Religion. Above all, people, and mostly men. Truckloads, boatloads, tiki-torch-parade-loads, courtloads of weak men all standing in the shadow that Trump casts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Republican Party has been corrupted absolutely. House Republicans have combined McCarthyism with Larry, Moe and Curlyism to twist Congress to comically corrupt ends \u2014 all to serve the greater degeneracy of Trump. In the Senate, the young hyenas, Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), study Trump\u2019s demagogy and lick their chops, hoping for a turn at democracy\u2019s carcass.\n\nThe establishment has utterly caved. Former Atty. Gen. William Barr\u2019s endorsement of Trump this week, after having called Trump unfit, a psychologically damaged incompetent who cares only about himself, was barely newsworthy. What is Barr but another in the long line of weak men, one more debased Republican offering fealty to the grease king? Trump thanked Barr by humiliating him again.\n\nBut it was the Republican Supreme Court \u2014 mostly men again \u2014 that put the shiv a little deeper in democracy\u2019s back this week. Originalists or textualists, all sounded more or less Trumpist as they seriously entertained Trump\u2019s argument that his assaults on the constitutional order are protected by the Constitution itself. There is no way to make honest sense of such a liar\u2019s mash. But Larry, Moe and Curly aren\u2019t just chairing committees in Congress. They wear robes and furrowed brows now, too. And they seem eager to pretend that crimes are just constitutional exercises of power, and that one ex-president is a king.\n\nRichard Nixon, a self-made, and self-corrupted, man who studied geopolitics and government assiduously, never achieved such a broad subjugation of American values and institutions. Trump, the ignorant, n\u2019er-do-well heir to his father\u2019s crooked fortune, has achieved so much more. Trump hasn\u2019t just captured the trenches of conservative America, he has taken the commanding heights. He owns all of it, from the most racist backwater saloon to the Federalist Society clubhouse. They are his corrupted subjects. He is their corrupt and demented king. If he can somehow get through the next few perilous months, he may yet render corruption sacred, and the republic irredeemable.",

        "text": "How Hitler Used Democracy to Take Power\nAdolf Hitler never won a majority in a free and open national election. He never received more than 37% of the vote in a free and open national election, but he argued that 37% represented 75% of 51%, and demanded political power. It was the political calculus by which the Nazi leader disabled, then dismantled, the Weimar Republic. Hitler exploited his 37% to gridlock legislative processes, to cudgel or crush the political opposition, and ultimately to undermine the country\u2019s democratic structures. When Hitler had vowed in court, in September 1930, to destroy democracy through the democratic process, a judge asked, \u201cSo, only through constitutional means?\u201d Hitler replied crisply, \u201cJawohl.\u201d\n\nHitler exercised his constitutional right to free speech and freedom of assembly to hold rallies across the country and spew invective in all directions\u2014against Bolsheviks, social democrats, immigrants, Jews, even fellow rightwing nationalists. He chided the ruling elites. If God had intended aristocrats to run the country, Hitler said at one rally in fall 1932, \u201cwe\u2019d all have been born with monocles.\u201d He vowed to make Germany great again. He promised a Third Reich bigger and better than the previous two.\n\nHitler fomented outrage and discontent. He endorsed a public referendum backing the \u201cLiberty Law,\u201d proposed legislation that called for the abrogation of the Treaty of Versailles. The German signatories to the treaty were to be executed for treason, along with any government official who implemented the treaty\u2019s provisions that included onerous reparation payments. It was reported, falsely, that the German government was drafting German teenagers and selling them into slavery abroad to service reparation debts. Hitler sowed lies and hatred, and harvested votes.\n\nWhen he entered the race for president, in spring 1932\u2014the only time Hitler ran for public office\u2014he lost by six million votes, securing just 36.77% of the electorate. Hitler went to court to have the election results overturned amid claims of voter fraud, but the judge dismissed the case out of hand.\n\nHitler had more success with the legislative branch of government. The Nazis first entered the 600-member Reichstag in 1926 when they secured twelve seats in national elections. \u201cWe come not as friends and not as neutrals,\u201d the brash, 32-year-old Reichstag delegate Joseph Goebbels warned at the time. \u201cWe come as mortal enemies.\u201d\n\nThe Nazis remained an insignificant, back-row minority until September 1930, following the crash of 1929, when they surged tenfold in Reichstag elections, then doubled that number in July 1932 elections. With 230 brownshirt delegates with swastika armbands, representing 37.3% of the electorate, Hitler commanded the country\u2019s largest political movement. Social democrats trailed with 21%, and the communists with 14%. A dozen other centrist and rightwing political parties filled the remaining seats in the Reichstag\u2019s vast glass-domed and wood-paneled plenary hall.\n\nThe country\u2019s largest political party generally had claim to the chancellorship, but President Paul von Hindenburg was concerned by Hitler\u2019s divisive politics, hate mongering, and antisemitism. In private, Hindenburg said that if he were to appoint \u201cthat Bohemian corporal\u201d to any position, it would be as Postmaster General, \u201cso he can lick me from behind on my stamps.\u201d Hindenburg told Hitler to his face that he would never appoint him chancellor \u201cfor the sake of God, my conscience, and the country.\u201d\n\nUndeterred, Hitler resorted to obstructionist politics. When he leveraged his 37% to gridlock the Reichstag, he forced Hindenburg to rule by \u201cemergency decree,\u201d a power guaranteed the president under Article 48 of the Weimar Constitution. Between December 1930 and April 1931, the Reichstag had enacted 19 pieces of legislation, with Hindenburg issuing only two Article 48 decrees. By the end of 1932, there were 59 \u201cemergency decrees\u201d compared with only five pieces of legislation. Writing in December 1932, a Time correspondent dryly observed that the German government appeared to be trying to \u201cout-Hitler Hitler.\u201d\n\nHitler had essentially and surprisingly quickly transformed a democratic republic into a constitutional dictatorship. Reichstag delegate Goebbels had observed a few years earlier, \u201cThe big joke on democracy is that it gives its mortal enemies the tools to its own destruction.\u201d Finally, on January 30, 1933, Hindenburg relented, agreeing to appoint Hitler chancellor to overcome the legislative gridlock and restore democratic procedures. We all know what followed.\n\nBack in the 1980s, as a graduate student at Harvard University, I was a teaching assistant for Dr. Richard M. Hunt in his core curriculum course, Literature and Arts C-45, that explored the moral dilemmas faced by the average German during the Weimar and Nazi eras. Harvard undergraduates facetiously dubbed an earlier incarnation of Hunt\u2019s course, \u201cKrauts and Doubts.\u201d\n\nIn helping explain the Weimar Republic\u2019s tilt into fascism, I used to cite an observation by Hans Frank, Hitler\u2019s private attorney, who helped engineer the strategy to disable democratic processes through constitutional means. Frank became complicit in Germany\u2019s wartime atrocities, including the murder of millions of Jews, for which he was hanged.\n\n\u201cThe F\u00fchrer was a man who was possible in Germany only at that very moment,\u201d Frank observed while awaiting trial in Nuremberg after the war. Had Hitler come a decade later \u201cwhen the republic was firmly established,\u201d Frank said, it would have been impossible for him to have seized power. Had he come a decade earlier, the German people would have returned to the Kaiser. As it was, Frank said, Hitler came \u201cat exactly this terrible transitory period\u201d when the monarchy was gone and the thirteen-year-old republic was not yet secure.\n\nI invoked the Frank temporal formula to contrast the fragility and ultimate failure of the thirteen-year-old Weimar Republic with the two centuries that Americans\u2014more than ten generations\u2014had had to forge the democratic values and processes that elevated the United States to a shining example for the world. Thirty years on, that contrast and claim seem frighteningly na\u00efve.\n\nAs we approach the 250th anniversary of our nation\u2019s founding, in July 2026, our republic appears to be plagued by the myriad ills that doomed Weimar\u2014political fragmentation, social polarization, hate-filled demagoguery, a legislature gridlocked by partisan posturing, and structural anomalies in voting processes. The electoral college makes it possible, though highly improbable, that a political leader could come to power with just 37% of the popular vote, unless, of course, a third candidate could siphon significant numbers of voters from the two leading candidates.\n\nIt has been said that the Weimar Republic died twice. It was murdered and it committed suicide. There is little mystery to the murder. Hitler vowed to destroy democracy through the democratic process\u2014and he did. An act of state suicide is less easily explained, especially when it involves a democratic republic replete with constitutional protections like freedom of expression, due process, and public referendum. As the November presidential election approaches, it is perhaps worthwhile to reflect on the lessons of Weimar and the potential consequences of electing a calculating and calibrating demagogue who promises to make the country great again.",

        "text": "CNN Poll: Trump maintains lead over Biden in 2024 matchup as views on their presidencies diverge\nCNN \u2014\n\nDonald Trump continues to hold an advantage over President Joe Biden as the campaign \u2013 and the former president\u2019s criminal trial \u2013 move forward, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS. And in the coming rematch, opinions about the first term of each man vying for a second four years in the White House now appear to work in Trump\u2019s favor, with most Americans saying that, looking back, Trump\u2019s term as president was a success, while a broad majority says Biden\u2019s has so far been a failure.\n\nTrump\u2019s support in the poll among registered voters holds steady at 49% in a head-to-head matchup against Biden, the same as in CNN\u2019s last national poll on the race in January, while Biden\u2019s stands at 43%, not significantly different from January\u2019s 45%.\n\nLooking back, 55% of all Americans now say they see Trump\u2019s presidency as a success, while 44% see it as a failure. In a January 2021 poll taken just before Trump left office and days after the January 6 attack on the US Capitol, 55% considered his time as president a failure.\n\nAssessing Biden\u2019s time in office so far, 61% say his presidency thus far has been a failure, while 39% say it\u2019s been a success. That\u2019s narrowly worse than the 57% who called the first year of his administration a failure in January 2022, with 41% calling it a success.\n\nRepublicans now are more unified around the idea that Trump\u2019s presidency was a success than Democrats are that Biden\u2019s has been one. Overall, 92% of Republicans call Trump\u2019s time in office a success, while just 73% of Democrats say Biden\u2019s has been a success so far. Among independents, 51% say Trump\u2019s presidency was successful, while only 37% see Biden\u2019s as a success.\n\nThere is some overlap in views of the two most recent presidents\u2019 achievements, with 14% of Americans saying they consider both are failures, while 8% say both are successes. About half of registered voters, 47%, consider Biden\u2019s presidency thus far to be a failure while saying Trump\u2019s was a success, while only 30% say Biden\u2019s has been successful and that Trump\u2019s was not. Public opinion of former presidents generally rises in retrospect, although no other modern president has attempted a similar return to power after an electoral loss.\n\nNegative views of Biden\u2019s work in office have held for much of his presidency. In the new poll, 60% disapprove of his handling of the job and 40% approve, about the same as it\u2019s been in CNN polling for more than a year. Even Biden\u2019s strongest issue approval ratings in the poll are also in negative territory, with 45% approving of his handling of health care policy and 44% approving his handling of student loan debt. And his worst issue approval rating \u2013 for his handling of the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza \u2013 yields 28% approval to 71% disapproval, including an 81% disapproval mark among those younger than 35 and majority disapproval among Democrats (53%).\n\nThe economy\n\nBiden\u2019s approval ratings for the economy (34%) and inflation (29%) remain starkly negative, as voters say economic concerns are more important to them when choosing a candidate than they were in each of the past two presidential contests. In the new poll, 65% of registered voters call the economy extremely important to their vote for president, compared with 40% who felt that way in early 2020 and 46% who said the same at roughly this point in 2016. Those voters who say the economy is deeply important break heavily for Trump in a matchup against Biden, 62% to 30%.\n\nA broad majority of all Americans, 70%, say economic conditions in the US are poor, with many, particularly Republicans, who feel that way saying their views would be more affected by a political shift than a change in the economy itself. About 4 in 10 in that group (41%) say that a change in political leadership in Washington would do more to change their impressions of the economy than a lower rate of inflation, a change in their personal financial situation or a sustained rise in the stock market. About 6 in 10 Republicans (61%) who say the economy is in bad shape say a change in leadership would shift their views, compared with 13% of Democrats who feel that way.\n\nAfter politics, a decline in the rate of inflation could change the minds of a sizable share of those who feel the economy is in bad shape \u2013 37% feel that way, with far fewer citing a positive change in their personal finances (14%) or a rise in the stock market (3%) as having that same effect.\n\nAmericans\u2019 perceptions of their own finances also remain negative, with 53% saying they are dissatisfied with their personal financial situation while 47% are satisfied.Dissatisfaction is starkly prevalent among those with lower incomes (67% dissatisfied in households with annual incomes lower than $50,000), people of color (64% say they are dissatisfied) and younger Americans (61% of those younger than 45 say they are dissatisfied).\n\nOther issues\n\nConsidering other issue priorities for the upcoming election, 58% of voters call protecting democracy an extremely important issue, the only other issue tested that a majority considers central to their choice. Nearly half call immigration, crime and gun policy deeply important (48% each), with health care (43%), abortion (42%) and nominations to the US Supreme Court (39%) each deeply important to about 4 in 10 voters. At the lower end of the scale, just 33% consider foreign policy that important, 27% climate change, 26% the war between Israel and Hamas, and 24% student loans.\n\nThere remain sharp partisan differences in which issues are most critical to choosing a president. Among Democratic-aligned voters, protecting democracy (67%), abortion (54%), the economy (52%), gun policy (51%) and health care (49%) all rank as key for about half or more, while on the GOP-aligned side, it\u2019s the economy (79%), immigration (71%), crime (65%) and then democracy (54%).\n\nBeyond issues, impressions of both candidates remain mostly negative (58% of voters have an unfavorable view of Biden, 55% of Trump), and a narrow majority of voters, 53%, say they are dissatisfied with the candidates they have to choose from in this year\u2019s presidential contest.\n\nA sizable 17% of registered voters say they have unfavorable views of both Biden and Trump, and in choosing between the two, they break for Trump, 43% to 31%, with 25% of that group saying they would vote for someone else, skip the contest entirely or just aren\u2019t sure who they would support.\n\nAmong all voters, when independent candidates Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Cornel West and Green Party candidate Jill Stein are included in the matchup, Trump holds 42% to Biden\u2019s 33%, with Kennedy at 16%, West at 4% and Stein at 3%. Kennedy draws 13% each from supporters of Biden and Trump in the initial two-way matchup.\n\nIn the Biden vs. Trump matchup, the poll finds Biden faring worse than in previous CNN polls among the youngest voters, trailing Trump by a 51%-to-40% margin among voters younger than 35. Biden\u2019s deficit with voters in that group is driven largely by those who did not vote in 2020. With that group excluded, voters between the ages of 18 and 34 in this poll divide 46% for Biden to 47% for Trump. Although not all polls release crosstabs or use the same age breaks when reporting results, other recent polling has shown a wide range of results for younger voters in testing a matchup between Trump and Biden, ranging from an 18-point Trump advantage among those younger than 30 in the Fox News poll in mid-March up to a 21-point Biden advantage among those younger than 30 in the Pew Research survey earlier this month.\n\nAmong all voters, Biden remains at a bit of a disadvantage relative to Trump in terms of the share of voters who have ruled out voting for him: 52% say there\u2019s no chance they would support him, while 47% say there\u2019s no chance they would back Trump, both numbers are similar to the level found in a fall CNN survey. A small share of registered voters \u2013 5% for Biden, 3% for Trump \u2013 say that although they are not currently backing that candidate they would consider them.\n\nBut the poll finds that Biden voters and Trump voters largely just don\u2019t understand each other. Among those who do not currently support Biden, 66% say they don\u2019t understand why anyone would support him, and 63% of those not backing Trump say they can\u2019t understand why anyone would support him.\n\nThe CNN poll was conducted by SSRS from April 18-23 among a random national sample of 1,212 adults drawn from a probability-based panel, including 967 registered voters. Surveys were either conducted online or by telephone with a live interviewer. Results among the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points. For results among registered voters, it is plus or minus 3.8 points.\n\nCNN\u2019s Ariel Edwards-Levy and Ed Wu contributed to this story.",

        "text": "How one Wisconsin man plagued election offices and stoked mistrust\nPeter Bernegger has spent the last three and a half years bombarding local election offices in Wisconsin with litigation and accusations of fraud. He\u2019s brought at least 18 lawsuits against election clerks and offices in state court, and on social media, he has relentlessly promoted his litigation and circulated false claims about election fraud in the swing state.\n\nHis campaign has recently landed him in legal trouble \u2013 Bernegger now faces criminal charges for allegedly falsifying a subpoena in connection with a lawsuit against the state\u2019s top election office.\n\nIt\u2019s an escalation for the 61-year-old activist from New London, Wisconsin, who according to court documents, interviews with election officials and emails obtained by the Guardian, has drained election offices of already-limited resources and stoked mistrust in the electoral process in his years-long quest to uncover election fraud.\n\nIn the universe of activists who dispute the results of the 2020 election and have spent years searching for evidence of widespread voter fraud, Bernegger\u2019s star power is small. He has not served on a Trump campaign team, no high-powered conservative law firms have taken on his cases and his media appearances are mostly relegated to interviews with fringe podcasts on the rightwing YouTube alternative Rumble.\n\nBut his efforts prove that in a country where election offices are chronically underfunded and heavily scrutinized, a single, relatively unknown person can exercise an outsize, and detrimental, impact on election administration.\n\nIn response to a request for comment, Bernegger did not address the claims raised in this article except to call them \u201cfalse and misleading\u201d and potentially defamatory.\n\nBernegger became active in \u201celection integrity\u201d efforts in the wake of the 2020 election, developing an audience during the Wisconsin state legislature\u2019s investigation into allegations of election fraud.\n\nLed by the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d activist and former state supreme court justice Michael Gableman, Wisconsin\u2019s legislative inquiry into election malfeasance ultimately revealed no evidence of a plot. But it elevated the profiles of numerous election-doubting activists in the state, including Bernegger, a self-described \u201cinvestigative journalist\u201d who claimed to have discovered thousands of illegal votes cast during the 2020 election using a \u201csupercomputer\u201d and a team of vigilante researchers.\n\nIn 2022, he went on to promote his claims in front of the state legislature, spending two hours describing his findings to the assembly committee on elections and campaigns.\n\nNow, in Wisconsin\u2019s sprawling community of election workers, Bernegger is known for sending barrages of requests for election-related records and suing when he is dissatisfied with the results. Since 2020, Bernegger, who is not an attorney, has represented himself in his many lawsuits against election clerks and offices, sometimes abandoning them before they are concluded. In at least two cases, Bernegger\u2019s complaints were dismissed on the grounds that he had simply stopped responding.\n\nIn 2022, the Wisconsin elections commission voted to fine Bernegger a dollar for every claim of voter fraud the bipartisan group found to be frivolous in nature; his penalties amounted to $2,403.\n\nI think the biggest thing is fear of retaliation \u2013 you know, and what\u2019s he going to do to make our lives more difficult Anonymous Wisconsin clerk\n\nElection officials, especially those whose small offices are already strained, worry that speaking about Bernegger publicly will invite more litigation, tying up more crucial time and resources.\n\n\u201cI think the biggest thing is fear of retaliation \u2013 you know, and what\u2019s he going to do to make our lives more difficult, especially as we go into the 24 election cycle,\u201d said a Wisconsin clerk whose office Bernegger has sued, but who asked for anonymity, citing the concern that Bernegger would renew his legal efforts. \u201cIt\u2019s also just demoralizing to have somebody constantly attacking your integrity.\u201d\n\nIn addition to filing public records requests, Bernegger has directly contacted clerks across the state with confusing and misleading emails. In an email sent on 25 October, 2022, for example, Bernegger claimed, incorrectly, that the state\u2019s electronic poll books, called Badger Books, required federal certification and that by using them, officials could be sued or face criminal charges.\n\n\u201cAny Clerk who uses Badger Books in any election, especially a federal one, will be breaking the law. This is directly on Meagan Wolfe,\u201d wrote Bernegger, referring to Wisconsin\u2019s top non-partisan election official who has become the focus of election-related conspiracy theories. \u201cShe put you, the Clerks, in this precarious legal position.\u201d\n\nScott McDonell, the Dane county clerk, said municipal clerks across the county had reached out to him multiple times to flag Bernegger\u2019s misleading communications.\n\nIn Dane county, where the state capital, Madison, is located, election conspiracy theories play a minimal role in local politics. As a result, McDonell is less politically vulnerable than officials in deep-red jurisdictions. He said he worries more about election clerks overseeing offices in smaller, less resourced municipalities in parts of the state where doubts about the results of the 2020 election have persisted.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s causing them a lot of problems \u2013 in a lot of ways, more than me,\u201d said McDonell. In total, McDonell estimates that his office had spent more than 100 hours on Bernegger\u2019s inquiries and litigation.\n\nAt least one of Wisconsin\u2019s more than 1,800 election clerks is receptive to Bernegger\u2019s claims. In response to an email from the Guardian inquiring about Bernegger\u2019s legal efforts, Donald Hayes, the clerk in Richmond \u2013 a town of just over 1,000 in southern Wisconsin \u2013 wrote that he believed that the \u201cright to freely elect our President was stolen from us during the last Presidential election\u201d and that Bernegger\u2019s efforts were an attempt \u201cto bring light to that tragedy\u201d.\n\n\u201cAs an election official, I discovered evidence from our very own election process, thanks to Mr Bernegger\u2019s inquiry, that confirmed my suspicions,\u201d wrote Hayes.\n\nHayes did not respond to a question about the evidence Bernegger purportedly uncovered.\n\nAt times, clerks said Bernegger\u2019s activism borders on harassment. In 2023, the Wisconsin state capitol police warned him that his conduct towards Wolfe, the chief administrator of the Wisconsin elections commission, could be interpreted as \u201cstalking\u201d.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Stakes \u2014 Presidential Transition Free newsletter We will guide you through the aftermath of the US election and the transition to a Trump presidency Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Among other ventures Bernegger touted was a company called We-Gel, which he claimed was capable of harnessing waste from catfish processing plants to produce an alternative form of gelatin \u2013 one that could be used widely in pharmaceuticals.\n\nBut there was a problem. The business partners \u201cwere never able to manufacture a sellable product\u201d, according to charges brought by the justice department in a 2008 case before a US district court in Mississippi. A jury convicted Bernegger of mail fraud and bank fraud for his participation in the scheme.\n\nBernegger successfully appealed the initial amount of restitution down to $1.7m, from the approximately $2.2m initially ordered, but was unable to convince the courts to reduce his prison sentence of 70 months.\n\nIt is not clear how Bernegger, whose grandparents founded the sausage and meat company Hillshire Farm, sustains his election-related efforts today.\n\nBernegger is listed as the agent of two organizations registered in Wisconsin called Election Watch, Inc. and Wisconsin Center for Election Justice, Inc. In 2022, the latter group garnered $12,500 from an organization founded by the Trump ally and former Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne, according to the group\u2019s most recent tax filings.\n\nAmid his prosecution for allegedly doctoring a subpoena, Bernegger circulated a call for donations on a crowdfunding website. As of 25 April, he had received a smattering of small donations from individuals, amounting to just over $4,500 \u2013 far less than the fundraiser\u2019s stated goal of $45,000.\n\nEven as Bernegger\u2019s criminal proceedings wear on, which he describes as \u201cpolitically motivated\u201d, he continues to spread alarming and unsubstantiated claims about elections on the messaging app Telegram and on X, where he maintains 25,500 followers.\n\nElection officials worry he will ramp up his activism ahead of the 2024 general presidential election.\n\nIn an 8 April post \u2013 six days after Wisconsin\u2019s 2024 presidential primary \u2013 Bernegger claimed that the clerk of Ozaukee county was unable to certify the election. \u201cDominion modems,\u201d he wrote, \u201cfailed to transmit.\u201d In the post, which was shared 1,600 times, Bernegger wrote that the clerk was \u201cpanicking\u201d and \u201cliberal Dem observers are going berserk\u201d.\n\nIn fact, in Ozaukee county, which encompasses some of Milwaukee\u2019s northern suburbs, the election results were certified promptly \u2013 and Karen Niemuth, the Ozaukee county clerk, was far from panicked.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even have an increased heart rate,\u201d Niemuthsaid, \u201cbecause my canvass is complete, and it is certified, and there were no issues.\u201d",

        "text": "US election forecaster with near-perfect track record not ready to call 2024 just yet\nPhoto: AFP\n\nAn American historian with an uncanny track record of predicting the winners of US presidential elections expects Joe Biden to win his rematch with Donald Trump later this year.\n\nAllan Lichtman told RNZ's Sunday Morning \"a lot of things would have to go wrong to predict a Biden defeat\", but he was not quite ready yet to lock his prediction in.\n\nIn the early 1980s Lichtman developed the 'Keys to the White House' system - a checklist of 13 statements where if five or fewer are false, the candidate for the incumbent party will win; but if six or more are false, the challenger will.\n\nThe keys are based on a range of factors, including the state of the economy, the previous mid-term election results, social unrest, charisma and more.\n\nUsing this system, Lichtman has correctly predicted the winners of every presidential election since 1984, except 2000.\n\nEven then, his pick - Democrat Al Gore - won the popular vote, but was famously denied the presidency by the courts.\n\nLichtman went against the pollsters in 2016, predicting a Trump victory over Hillary Clinton, and was sent a congratulatory note by the former reality TV star.\n\n\"At the same time, I made my prediction of a Trump impeachment before he was even elected - but he didn't acknowledge that,\" Lichtman joked.\n\nPhoto: Supplied\n\nLichtman correctly predicted that Biden would defeat the incumbent Trump in 2020, making Trump the first sitting US president in nearly three decades to not be re-elected.\n\nLichtman also foresaw incumbent George H. W. Bush's loss in 1992 to upstart Bill Clinton, despite the polls.\n\n\"In 1988, George H. W. Bush in May - we're not even in May yet - was 17 points behind his opponent, the Democratic governor Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts, and every pundit had written off H. W. Bush.\n\n\"And I wrote in the Washtingtonian magazine in May of 1988 not only is Bush gonna win, but he's gonna win in a shoo-in, because forget about the polls. He's running on the Reagan record of peace, prosperity and domestic tranquillity. And of course, Bush went on to win quite handily\u2026\n\n\"And a lot of people were predicting again H. W. Bush's win, and I predicted a Clinton win and again, he won pretty handily.\"\n\nThe 13 keys are:\n\nthe incumbent winning more seats in the previous mid-term elections\n\nno serious internal party challenger to the incumbent\n\nthe incumbent is the sitting president\n\nthere is no serious third-party candidate\n\na strong short-term economy (ie no recession during the campaign)\n\na strong long-term economy (economic growth higher than previous two terms)\n\nthe incumbent made major policy changes\n\nno significant social unrest\n\nno major scandals for the incumbent administration\n\nno major military or foreign policy failure\n\na major win for foreign policy or the military\n\na charismatic candidate for the incumbent party\n\nthe challenger being uncharismatic.\n\nIn the interview with Sunday Morning, Lichtman explained how so far, it appeared Biden has seven keys 'true' at this stage, two false, and the rest unclear.\n\nThe Democrats lost a few seats in the mid-terms, and Biden was not the most charismatic of leaders, being a \"vanilla candidate\", Lichtman said.\n\nOn the other hand, he had no serious contender for the Democrat nomination; he was the incumbent president; the US economy was not in recession; the economy had been stronger under Biden's leadership than it was under Trump and during Barack Obama's second term; Biden has had \"more policy accomplishments domestically than any president since Lyndon Johnson\"; and the Republicans had \"come up absolutely empty\" in their attempts to pin a scandal on the president, partly because he is \"vanilla\".\n\nAs for Trump's charisma, Lichtman said that key favoured Biden, because \"it's got to be broad charismatic appeal\", which Trump did not have.\n\n\"It can't just be appealed to a narrow base... Donald Trump lost the popular vote in two elections combined by 10 million votes, so his appeal to the narrow base does not turn that key against the Democrats.\"\n\nKeys still in the undecided column included whether a third party challenger could disrupt the usual two-horse race (for example, Robert F Kennedy Jr); social unrest (the recent university Gaza protests); and the two concerning foreign policy (ongoing conflict in the Middle East and Ukraine).\n\n\"In 2020 I made my call in early August, so I would expect to make the call then, but you never know. Events are so fluid. Things are so complex right now with two wars raging, you know, these protests, an uncertain economy - I presume keys will fall into place by then but I can't absolutely guarantee it.\"\n\nBut when he did, he would make a call one way or the other - and would not hedge his bets.\n\n\"I do this every four years and I have to say I get real nervous - because unlike the pollsters, I tell you who's gonna win and who's gonna lose,\" Lichtman said.\n\n\"I go out on a limb every four years. And I have to say, you know, I've been doing this for over 40 years and it makes me a little nervous.\"",

        "text": "Why fentanyl, reportedly the biggest killer of Americans aged 18-49, figured in Antony Blinken\u2019s China visit\nUS Secretary of State Anthony Blinken\u2019s three-day visit to China concluded on Friday (April 26), after a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Apart from talks on Ukraine, Taiwan, and China\u2019s \u201cdangerous actions\u201d in the South China Sea, Blinken also spoke about the production and export of \u201csynthetic opioid precursors\u201d, specifically the drug fentanyl, during the visit, the Associated Press reported.\n\nIn a video posted to X on April 24, Blinken said that he planned to \u201cwork on issues that matter to the American people. One of those is fentanyl synthetic opioids, the leading killer of Americans between the ages of 18 and 49.\u201d In another post on Friday, he said the issue of counternarcotics was an area of \u201cshared interest\u201d discussed during his meeting with Chinese Foreign Affairs Minister Wang Yi.\n\nHere is why fentanyl is a major problem for the United States \u2014 and China\u2019s role in it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is the scale of the United States\u2019 opioid epidemic?\n\nOpioids are a class of drugs that \u201cderive from, or mimic, natural substances found in the opium poppy plant\u201d, according to the website of US-based Johns Hopkins Medicine. They produce a variety of effects, including pain relief and euphoria, and are highly addictive. Some common opioids include oxycodone, morphine, codeine, heroin, and fentanyl.\n\nAccording to the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), \u201cFentanyl is a potent synthetic opioid drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use as an analgesic [for pain relief] and anesthetic. It is approximately 100 times more potent than morphine and 50 times more potent than heroin as an analgesic.\u201d But overdoses can cause \u201cstupor, changes in pupil size, clammy skin, cyanosis [blue skin], coma, and respiratory failure leading to death\u201d.\n\nUsers feel opioids\u2019 impact immediately, and it wears off as quickly \u2014 making users need it regularly. Often, people who initially start using prescription opioid-based painkillers get addicted.\n\nThe US has been witnessing what many have called an \u201copioid epidemic\u201d. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \u201cthe number of people who died from a drug overdose in 2021 was over six times the number in 1999\u2026 Over 75% of the nearly 107,000 drug overdose deaths in 2021 involved an opioid\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWaves of opioid deaths in the US. (Via CDC website) Waves of opioid deaths in the US. (Via CDC website)\n\nWhat is China\u2019s role in the opioid epidemic?\n\nThe US saw a spike in synthetic opioid-related deaths after 2013, largely due to the rapid proliferation of illicitly manufactured fentanyl, and fentanyl analogues like acetyl fentanyl and carfentanil. A US House Committee report from April 16 found that inexpensive fentanyl is increasingly cut into other drugs, often without the buyers\u2019 knowledge.\n\nThe US has primarily blamed two countries for the trafficking of fentanyl \u2014 Mexico and China. A 2020 DEA intelligence report (\u2018Fentanyl Flow to the United States\u2019), stated that fentanyl and fentanyl-related substances were trafficked from China through international mail and express consignment operations.\n\nInvestigative journalist Ben Westhoff told Vice News about how he found several Chinese companies in Wuhan and Shanghai being involved in the manufacturing of chemicals used to create synthetic opioids (precursors). China-manufactured chemicals would be shipped to Mexico for processing into pills and then sent to the US.\n\nThe previously mentioned House committee report stated that the Chinese Communist Party \u201cdirectly subsidises\u201d fentanyl production through tax rebates to companies \u2014 often engaged in other, legal chemical manufacturing \u2014 which are implicated in the production of precursors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn April 24, US President Joe Biden signed the FEND Off Fentanyl Bill into law to combat \u201cillicit fentanyl traffickers in Mexico and the creators of precursor chemicals in China\u201d.\n\nNeed for US-China cooperation\n\nThe US understands that dealing with the fentanyl crisis at home needs cooperation with China. Both governments have made occasional progress on the matter.\n\nIn 2019, China announced it would add fentanyl-related substances to a list of controlled narcotic drugs. According to the DEA, China\u2019s move saw some of the production shifting to India, although here too export of fentanyl precursors has been regulated since 2018.\n\nHowever, given the deterioration of the US-China relations following the Covid-19 pandemic, trade wars, and tensions over Taiwan and the South China Sea, cooperation on this front has been adversely impacted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf late, there has been an attempt at resuming cooperation. In November 2023, following Xi\u2019s meeting with Biden, a bilateral Counternarcotics Working Group was announced to coordinate law enforcement actions and address the misuse of precursor chemicals, among other things.\n\nThe many roadblocks to dealing with the fentanyl crisis\n\nAccording to Westhoff, a lot also depends on China\u2019s local governments. Many provinces see fentanyl production as a source of employment for people. To evade law enforcement agencies, operations often slightly tweak the formulae of certain chemicals.\n\nChina has also deflected blame onto the US, pointing to how even before fentanyl, the opioid crisis was in full swing. US pharmaceutical companies such as Purdue Pharma have been accused of handing out heavy-duty opioid prescriptions to patients, making them opioid addicts who seek ever more potent drugs.\n\nAnd China is just a part of a much more complex puzzle, involving many countries, criminal organisations, and issues. For instance, Mexico is a major player in the trade, but cooperation with the country has been difficult to achieve. Earlier this year, the AP reported the head of Mexico\u2019s detective agency as saying: \u201cMexico has been the champion of methamphetamine production, and now fentanyl.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith the US presidential elections due this year, fentanyl and opioid misuse is a major topic for voters. A Bloomberg News/Morning Consult poll from March found that 8 out of 10 voters in the seven swing states (states where Democrats and Republicans have similar levels of support ) said fentanyl misuse is a \u201cvery important\u201d or \u201csomewhat important\u201d issue for them in voting. This was more than the number who cited abortion, climate change, labour and unions, or the wars in Ukraine and Gaza.",

        "text": "Why Chris Christie\u2019s spiteful Biden comments are so dangerous\nNot long ago, I wrote a column about high-profile Republicans not voting for former President Donald Trump, and that we should \u201clet them be\u201d if they wouldn\u2019t commit to voting for President Joe Biden, since at the least they wouldn\u2019t be casting a vote for Trump.\n\nI still stand by that. But when a prominent Republican declares that he can\u2019t vote for Trump and then completely trashes Biden by calling him \u201cnot qualified to be president,\u201d that\u2019s a different story. And I believe it\u2019s one that should be called out.\n\nIn spite of stating over and over that he doesn\u2019t want to see Trump elected again, Christie risks sacrificing the future of the country over his obsession with his own relevance.\n\nFormer New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie recently brought his straightforward, call-it-as-he-sees-it style in full force during a discussion with Leigh Ann Caldwell from The Washington Post at the University of Chicago Institute of Politics. It didn\u2019t take long to see that behind his attempt to project a happy warrior image, he is still bitter over his own failed run for the presidency. Worse yet, in spite of stating over and over that he doesn\u2019t want to see Trump elected again, Christie risks sacrificing the future of the country over his obsession with his own relevance.\n\nChristie stated that he would not be voting for Biden, and that Trump is \u201cwholly unfit to be president of the United States, in every way you can think of.\u201d He could have stopped there; but then he commented that Biden is past his \u201csell-by date,\u201d and that he didn\u2019t believe Biden is up for another term. He also voiced his dismay over the fact that team Biden hasn\u2019t reach out to him.\n\nChristie knows full well how these sort of comments can be used against Biden, and worse yet, can help Trump should they be used in a very targeted way. Christie himself was blamed by some people (wrongly, I believe) for hurting Mitt Romney\u2019s campaign when he welcomed then-President Barack Obama with a warm handshake upon his arrival to New Jersey to see the devastating damage from Superstorm Sandy just days before the 2012 presidential election.\n\nFor years I have generally liked Christie, even though I haven\u2019t always agreed with him. I was disappointed with his choice to endorse Trump in 2016 and even more so after he actively helped Trump in his re-election campaign, when the dangers of a second Trump term were obvious. I thought I was done with him then, but when he rightly called out the former president immediately after the 2020 election, his was a welcome voice in the 2024 Republican primary.\n\nChristie had a good run; he talked about the issues and most of all brought the fight directly to Trump. When it turned out Nikki Haley had a better campaign, his decision not to endorse her once he dropped out seemed petty. But it was his \u201chot mic\u201d moment in January, saying, \u201cShe\u2019s going to get smoked \u2014 you and I both know it. She\u2019s not up to this,\u201d that showed us exactly how spiteful he could be. Although he called the gaffe a \u201ccomplete mistake,\u201d it still shows as pretty weak.\n\nClearly, Christie now wants everyone to hear what he\u2019s saying about Haley and Biden, and he wasn\u2019t shy about calling both of them out during his University of Chicago talk. During the conversation with Caldwell, Christie said he didn\u2019t run as an independent because he didn\u2019t see a path to winning, and he wouldn\u2019t be able to live with himself if his run ended up hurting Biden and helping Trump get elected.\n\nChristie may deserve some leeway with his initial Biden comments; after all, he has significant policy differences with Biden, and he wanted to be the Republican nominee to run again Biden this fall. But in the question-and-answer portion of the talk, he really unleashed on Biden, saying he was not qualified to be president. (He also took a parting shot at Haley, saying she will run for president in 2028, and \u201cshe will stand for just as little as she stood for this time.\u201d)\n\nAfter working with politicians for over 30 years, I have seen just how much it pains many of them not to be relevant in the public square. But Christie should know better than to let his own feelings potentially influence an election in such a dangerous way.\n\nIt\u2019s OK for Christie not to support Biden, and maybe his feeling are hurt because team Biden hasn\u2019t extended an invitation to him to join in on a run against Trump \u2014 all of which comes back to the need to be relevant. What is not OK is for Christie to run off at the mouth, putting his own ego ahead of what is best for the country.",

        "text": "Poll: Biden and Trump supporters sharply divided by the media they consume\nSupporters of President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are sharply divided across all sorts of lines, including the sources they rely on to get their news, new data from the NBC News poll shows.\n\nBiden is the clear choice of voters who consume newspapers and national network news, while Trump does best among voters who don\u2019t follow political news at all.\n\nThe stark differences help highlight the strategies both candidates are using as they seek another term in the White House \u2014 and shed some light on why the presidential race appears relatively stable.\n\nThe poll looked at various forms of traditional media (newspapers, national network news and cable news), as well as digital media (social media, digital websites and YouTube/Google). Among registered voters, 54% described themselves as primarily traditional news consumers, while 40% described themselves as primarily digital media consumers.\n\nBiden holds an 11-point lead among traditional news consumers in a head-to-head presidential ballot test, with 52% support among that group to Trump\u2019s 41%. But it\u2019s basically a jump ball among digital media consumers, with Trump at 47% and Biden at 44%.\n\nAnd Trump has a major lead among those who don\u2019t follow political news \u2014 53% back him, and 27% back Biden.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost comic. If you\u2019re one of the remaining Americans who say you read a newspaper to get news, you are voting for Biden by 49 points,\u201d said Republican pollster Bill McInturff, who conducted the poll alongside Democratic pollster Jeff Horwitt.\n\nThe trends also extend to other questions in the poll. There's a significant difference in how traditional news consumers view Biden, while digital news consumers are far more in line with registered voters overall.\n\nMore primarily traditional news consumers have positive views of Biden (48%) than negative ones (44%). Among primarily digital news consumers, 35% view Biden positively, and 54% view him negatively. Vice President Kamala Harris' positive ratings show a similar divide, while Trump is viewed similarly by news consumers of both stripes.\n\nAnd although the sample size is small, those who don't follow political news feel more positively about Trump and independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and more negatively about Biden.\n\nTrump\u2019s lead among those not following political news caught Horwitt\u2019s eye amid Trump's trial on charges related to allegations he paid hush money to quash news of an alleged affair from coming out during the heat of his 2016 presidential campaign and as he faces legal jeopardy in other cases that consistently make news.\n\n\u201cThese are voters who have tuned out information, by and large, and they know who they are supporting, and they aren\u2019t moving,\u201d Horwitt said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s hard to move this race based on actual news. They aren\u2019t seeing it, and they don\u2019t care,\u201d he continued.\n\nThird-party candidates also do well with this chunk of the electorate \u2014 a quarter of the 15% who say they don\u2019t follow political news choose one of the other candidates in a five-way ballot test that includes Kennedy, Jill Stein and Cornel West. Third-party supporters also make up similar shares of those who say they get their news primarily from social media and from websites.\n\nBut voting behavior among those groups suggests that Biden's stronger showing with those traditional media consumers puts him ahead with a more reliable voting bloc.\n\nOf those polled who could be matched to the voter file, 59% of those who voted in both 2020 and 2022 primarily consume traditional media, 40% primarily consume digital media, and just 9% don't follow political news. (The percentages add up to more than 100% because some people chose media platforms across multiple categories.)\n\nThose who voted less frequently were more likely to say they don\u2019t follow political news: 19% of those who voted in the last presidential election but not in 2022 and 27% who voted in neither of the last two elections say they don't follow political news.\n\nThe NBC News poll of 1,000 registered voters nationwide \u2014 891 contacted via cellphone \u2014 was conducted April 12-16, and it has an overall margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.",

DHS is responsibly leveraging AI to advance homeland security mission, while protecting individuals\u2019 privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties. DHS is helping to secure the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure from AI-enabled threats, issuing safety and security guidelines for AI used in critical systems, and recruiting the talent needed to shape the future of AI and tech innovation.\n\nTo learn more about DHS\u2019s work in AI, visit the Artificial Intelligence at DHS webpage.\n\nProtecting water supplies, power grids, telecommunications and other critical infrastructure from AI-enabled threats\n\nEstablished the AI Safety and Security Board (AISSB) \u2013 Over 20 technology and critical infrastructure executives, civil rights leaders, academics, and policymakers are advising the Secretary, the critical infrastructure community, private sector stakeholders, and the broader public on the safe and secure development and deployment of AI in our nation\u2019s critical infrastructure, as well as the mitigation of threats and risks that AI could pose. This includes recommendations to prevent and prepare for AI-related disruptions to critical services that impact national or economic security, public health, or safety.\n\n\n\nDeveloped the First AI Guidelines for Critical Infrastructure Owners and Operators \u2013 DHS, in partnership with CISA, developed new safety and security guidelines for use by critical infrastructure owners and operators. These guidelines are informed by the whole-of-government effort to assess AI risks across all sixteen critical infrastructure sectors, and address threats both to and from, and involving AI systems.\n\n\n\nShared New Resources to Reduce Risks at the Intersection of AI and Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Threats \u2013The AI Chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) Report [submitted to the President] was developed through strong collaboration across government, academia, and industry. The report examines risks at the intersection of AI and CBRN threats. It also identifies trends in AI and types of AI models that might present or intensify biological and chemical threats to the U.S. Finally, the report offers recommendations to mitigate potential threats to national security by overseeing the training, deployment, publication, and use of AI models and underlying data, including the role of safety evaluations and guardrails.\n\nIncorporating AI into Carrying Out the Homeland Security mission through safe, responsible and trustworthy use\n\nUnveiled a new, whole-of-Department AI roadmap \u2013 The DHS AI roadmap, the most detailed AI plans put forward by a federal agency to date, details DHS\u2019s 2024 plans, which include testing uses of the technologies that deliver meaningful benefits to the American public and advance homeland security, while ensuring that individuals\u2019 privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties are protected. The roadmap outlines three lines of effort DHS is using to guide its work: Responsibly leverage AI to advance Homeland Security missions while protecting individuals\u2019 privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties; Promote Nationwide AI Safety and Security; and Continue to lead in AI through strong cohesive partnerships\n\n\n\nImplemented pilot projects to test AI technology \u2013 These innovative pilot projects will deploy AI in specific mission areas: Per the EO, CISA completed an operational pilot using AI cybersecurity systems to aid in the detection and remediation of vulnerabilities in critical United States Government software, systems, and networks. Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) will use AI to enhance investigative processes focused on detecting fentanyl and increasing efficiency of investigations related to combatting child sexual exploitation. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will deploy AI to help communities plan for and develop hazard mitigation plans to build resilience and minimize risks. United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) will use AI to improve immigration officer training.\n\n\n\nLaunched the AI Corps Recruitment Sprint to Hire 50 Experienced/Expert Technologists \u2013 The Department announced its first-ever hiring sprint to recruit 50 AI technology experts in 2024. The new DHS \u201cAI Corps\u201d is modeled after the U.S. Digital Service, building teams that will help better leverage this new technology responsibly across strategic areas of the homeland security enterprise including efforts to counter fentanyl, combat child sexual exploitation and abuse, deliver immigration services, secure travel, fortify our critical infrastructure, and enhance our cybersecurity. The Department most recently hired a highly qualified executive director to ensure that the Corps' success and is continuing to pursue top AI talent to build out the AI Corps.\n\nEnsuring the economic security, and competitiveness of American AI innovation\n\nLaunched a Training Program to Combat Intellectual Property Theft Through AI Generated Material \u2013 Protecting AI intellectual property (IP) is critical to U.S. global competitiveness, as IP theft threatens U.S. businesses, jobs, and national security. To tackle this issue and in response to the Executive Order: HSI has partnered with Michigan State University\u2019s Center for Anti-Counterfeiting and Product Protection (A-CAPP) to create a training program to help industry and domestic law enforcement better understand and respond to AI-related IP theft. The Intellectual Property Rights Center (IPR Center), led by HSI, encourages members of the public, industry, trade associations, law enforcement, and government agencies to report potential violations of intellectual property rights involving AI through their website. The information provided is then reviewed promptly by IPR Center staff and disseminated for appropriate investigative response and tactical use to IPR Center partners. The IPR center serves as whole of government center for the criminal enforcement of IP theft, to include AI-enabled digital piracy, product counterfeiting, trade fraud, and the theft of trade secrets.\n\n\n\nEnsuring the U.S. Attracts and Retains the Best Talent in AI and other Critical Emerging Technologies \u2013 Cultivating global talent in AI and other critical and emerging technologies is essential for U.S. innovation and competitiveness. To that end, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has: Streamlined processing times of petitions and applications for those seeking to work, study, or conduct research in the United States; Clarified and modernized policies for O-1A noncitizens of extraordinary ability, EB-1 noncitizens of extraordinary ability and outstanding professors and researchers, EB-2 advanced-degree holders and noncitizens of exceptional ability, Startup founders using the International Entrepreneur Rule, and International students.\n\n\n\nReleased public data on how experts in AI and other critical and emerging technologies have increasingly utilized the immigration system through the end of Fiscal Year 2023 Implemented a final rule to strengthen the integrity of the H-1B registration process and published a comprehensive proposed rule to modernize the H-1B specialty occupation worker program and enhance its integrity and usage.\n\n\n\nAs DHS deploys AI responsibly, it will work under the President\u2019s direction to harness the opportunities and reduce the potential harms of this revolutionary technology.\n\n###",

        "text": "Ohio Woman Found Guilty of Felony and Misdemeanor Charges Related to Jan. 6 Capitol Breach\nWASHINGTON - An Ohio woman was found guilty in the District of Columbia on Friday, April 26, 2024, of felony and misdemeanor offenses related to her conduct during the Jan. 6, 2021, breach of the U.S. Capitol. Her actions and the actions of others disrupted a joint session of the U.S. Congress convened to ascertain and count the electoral votes related to the 2020 presidential election.\n\nA federal jury convicted Therese Borgerding, 61, of Piqua, Ohio, of a felony offense of civil disorder and misdemeanor offenses of entering and remaining in a restricted building or grounds, disorderly and disruptive conduct in a restricted building or grounds, disorderly conduct in a Capitol building, and parading, demonstrating, or picketing in a Capitol building.\n\nU.S. District Judge Timothy J. Kelly will sentence Borgerding on Aug. 15, 2024.\n\nAccording to evidence presented during the trial, Borgerding traveled from her home in Ohio to Washington, D.C., with her husband, and codefendant Walter Messer, and made their way to the U.S. Capitol building on Jan. 6, 2021. Borgerding and her husband arrived at the East Plaza at 7:00 a.m. when the crowd was sparse. Borgerding carried a long pole with a circular sign with a big red \u201cQ\u201d affixed to the top and a small American flag sticking out of it.\n\nAfter reaching the barricades on the East Front, Borgerding and her husband remained immediately outside the restricted perimeter for several hours. At about 1:59 p.m., a large crowd had gathered and overrun the barricades at the East Front. Borgerding then approached the nearest barricades, unhooked two interlocking barricades, and pushed them apart, parting the way for herself and other rioters to run towards the Capitol. Borgerding then stood on the East steps near the Rotunda Doors for several minutes, joining chants and waving her sign in the air.\n\nAt approximately 2:41 p.m., police officers inside the Rotunda Doors attempted to shut the doors to the U.S. Capitol, which had previously been opened by rioters inside and outside the building; however, the officers were confronted by rioters outside who forced the doors back open and pushed their way into the building. Borgerding was in the immediate vicinity of this confrontation.\n\nStill holding her \u201cQ\u201d sign, Borgerding pushed her way through the Rotunda Doors and walked straight into the Rotunda, where she remained for approximately two minutes. She then joined the large crowd near the Senate Wing Doors and later exited through one of the smashed windows onto the Northwest Courtyard of the Capitol Building around 2:49 p.m. Borgerding remained in the Northwest Courtyard at length, chanting and waving her large sign.\n\nThe FBI arrested Borgerding on Aug. 6, 2021, in Dayton, Ohio.\n\nCodefendant Walter Messer was previously sentenced on Sept. 11, 2023, to 24 months of probation for his role in the events of January 6th.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Columbia and the Department of Justice National Security Division\u2019s Counterterrorism Section are prosecuting this case. The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of Ohio provided valuable assistance.\n\nThe FBI\u2019s Cincinnati and Washington Field Office investigated this case. The United States Capitol Police and the Metropolitan Police Department provided valuable assistance.\n\nIn the 39 months since Jan. 6, 2021, more than 1,385 individuals have been charged in nearly all 50 states for crimes related to the breach of the U.S. Capitol, including nearly 500 individuals charged with assaulting or impeding law enforcement, a felony. The investigation remains ongoing.\n\nAnyone with tips can call 1-800-CALL-FBI (800-225-5324) or visit tips.fbi.gov.",

Zelizer says the trial against Trump is a travesty of justice . He says it threatens to undermine the election and ultimately harm our democracy .",
        "text": "American people can see through Manhattan political trial against Trump\nThe trial that began last week in a Manhattan courtroom is a travesty of justice. There\u2019s no two ways around it. For the first time ever in American history, a politically elected prosecutor is trying to jail a former president and current declared candidate for that office. This prosecution, coming less than seven months before the presidential election, threatens to undermine the election and ultimately harm our democracy.\n\n\n\nThe allegations behind Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg\u2019s prosecution of President Trump are not new. In fact, all the key points have been known since 2018. Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s former lawyer, pleaded guilty to charges based on these same facts five years ago. At the time, federal prosecutors determined that no one else would be charged alongside Cohen, closing the case.\n\n\n\nLike their federal counterparts, prosecutors in the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s Office were initially skeptical of pursuing a case against Trump on these facts. Former Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance passed on the case. Bragg, Vance\u2019s successor, was ready to pass too, until a volunteer prosecutor in his office named Mark Pomerantz resigned in protest and went public criticizing Bragg. Pomerantz\u2019s scathing resignation letter was leaked to the New York Times, and he even penned a book taking Bragg to task for not being more aggressive in going after Trump. If Pomerantz couldn\u2019t convince Bragg to bring charges in private, he would do it publicly.\n\n\n\nPomerantz\u2019s book, described by one reviewer as 300 pages of \u201cscore-settling and scorn,\u201d lays bare the political animus motivating the prosecution of Trump. Pomerantz wrote about the thrill he got from investigating Trump and noted he would have gladly paid for the opportunity to prosecute the former president. The book described how Pomerantz pushed Bragg to resurrect the so-called \u201czombie\u201d case using a convoluted and unprecedented legal theory.\n\n\n\nTo get around the statute of limitations on what are ordinarily misdemeanor charges, prosecutors could bootstrap the misdemeanor allegations into felonies by alleging that the records were falsified to conceal a second (and still undefined) crime.\n\n\n\nBragg ultimately succumbed to the pressure campaign, filing charges in April 2023 based on Pomerantz\u2019s blueprint. Bragg built his case around the testimony of his star witness, Michael Cohen. But to say Cohen has a credibility problem is an understatement. Cohen has been convicted of several crimes, including lying to Congress. He\u2019s been disbarred as a lawyer. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan described Cohen\u2019s criminal conduct as \u201cknowing and calculated acts \u2014 acts Cohen executed in order to profit personally, build his own power, and enhance his level of influence.\u201d When sentencing Cohen in 2018, a federal judge called his wrongdoing \u201cextensive\u201d and \u201ca veritable smorgasbord of fraudulent conduct.\u201d\n\n\n\nBragg isn\u2019t the first Democrat to try to use Cohen to attack President Trump. In February 2019, the Democratic-led House Oversight Committee invited Cohen to testify at a hearing. In the course of just a few hours on Capitol Hill, Cohen managed to lie six separate times on matters both small and large. He lied about committing various fraudulent acts, crimes to which he pleaded guilty in federal court. Cohen\u2019s lies were so brazen that it earned him a criminal referral to the Justice Department for perjury.\n\n\n\nEven if one overlooked the political origins of this case, the untested legal theory and the credibility problems of the star witness, there remain other procedural irregularities that prevent President Trump from getting a fair shake. Bragg\u2019s office declined to extend the normal courtesy to Trump of notifying him in advance of the government\u2019s witness order. Bragg\u2019s office obtained a gag order to bar Trump from engaging in protected political speech under the threat of criminal contempt. While Cohen is free to smear Trump in the national media, Trump must remain silent or face fines and jail time.\n\n\n\nThink about that. As part of a political prosecution, at the height of the presidential campaign, Democrats in New York have silenced the Republican candidate and prevented him from defending himself from these attacks.\n\n\n\nAlvin Bragg\u2019s prosecution is a sad continuation of a long line of Democratic attempts to get President Trump. From the 2016 Russia hoax to the copycat political prosecutions in Atlanta and Washington going on today, Democrats have put America through eight years of turmoil all because of politics.\n\n\n\nAmericans see through this charade. They intuitively know when someone\u2019s getting a raw deal. They see crime in Manhattan as Bragg spends his time prosecuting a president for political reasons. They see violent criminals roaming the streets and local businesses shutting down because it\u2019s unsafe. Americans are smarter than Democrats give them credit for. Americans understand that politics is why President Trump is on trial.\n\nRead the full article here.",

For this analysis, we surveyed 10,133 U.S. adults from Feb. 7 to 11, 2024. Everyone who took part in the survey is a member of the Center\u2019s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. This way, nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. Read more about the ATP\u2019s methodology. Here are the questions used for this report, along with responses, and the survey methodology.\n\nMost Americans are wary of social media\u2019s role in politics and its overall impact on the country, and these concerns are ticking up among Democrats, according to a new Pew Research Center survey of U.S. adults.\n\nStill, Republicans stand out on several measures, with majorities believing major technology companies are biased toward liberals.\n\nOur survey asked Americans about three key areas: Social media\u2019s impact on politics and the country | Political censorship and bias in Big Tech| Government regulation of technology companies\n\nSocial media\u2019s impact on politics and the country\n\nSince 2020, more Americans \u2013 particularly Democrats \u2013 believe social media companies wield too much political power. Roughly eight-in-ten Americans (78%) say these companies have too much power and influence in politics today, according to a new Pew Research Center survey of 10,133 U.S. adults conducted Feb. 7-11, 2024. This is up from 72% in 2020.\n\nAnother 16% say these sites have the right amount of political influence, while only 4% think they don\u2019t have enough power.\n\nViews by party\n\nRepublicans and independents who lean toward the Republican Party (84%) are more likely than Democrats and Democratic leaners (74%) to think these companies have too much political power. And while Republicans\u2019 opinions have changed little since 2020, this view has grown more common among Democrats over the past four years: 74% of Democrats believe social media companies have too much power and influence in politics, up from 63% in 2020.\n\nWhat impact does social media have on the country?\n\nAmericans are far more likely to say social media has a negative rather than positive impact on the country. Roughly two-thirds (64%) think social media has a mostly negative effect on the way things are going in the country today.\n\nOnly 10% describe social media as having a mostly positive impact on the country. And about a quarter say these sites have neither a positive nor a negative effect.\n\nThese overall figures are nearly identical to what the Center found in 2020. For instance, the share of Americans who see social media\u2019s impact on the country as mostly negative has remained at 64%.\n\nViews by party\n\nMajorities in both political parties see social media\u2019s impact on the country negatively, though Republicans remain more wary than Democrats (71% vs. 59%). That said, a growing number of Democrats believe these platforms have a mostly bad impact on the country, rising to 59% in our current survey, up from 53% in 2020.\n\nBy comparison, the share of Republicans who say social media negatively affects the way things are going in the country has dropped from 78% in 2020 to 71% today.\n\nPolitical censorship and bias in Big Tech\n\nAs social media has become a key way people share news and information, some lawmakers and commentators \u2013 especially conservatives \u2013 have expressed concerns that these companies are politically biased and limit free speech.\n\nOur survey finds that most Americans think social media sites actively censor political viewpoints they disagree with. Roughly eight-in-ten U.S. adults (83%) say it\u2019s very or somewhat likely that these platforms intentionally censor political viewpoints they find objectionable, up from 77% in 2022. Just 17% in the current survey think this is not likely the case.\n\nViews by party\n\nMajorities in both parties believe political censorship is likely occurring on social media, but more Republicans hold this view. Fully 93% of Republicans say it\u2019s likely that social media sites intentionally censor political viewpoints that they find objectionable, including 66% who say that this is very likely happening.\n\nBy comparison, 74% of Democrats think this is likely occurring, with 25% saying there\u2019s a strong possibility this is occurring.\n\nRepublicans\u2019 views have held steady since 2022. But the share of Democrats who think it\u2019s likely that social media sites intentionally censor political viewpoints they object to is rising \u2013 74% say this today, up from 66% two years ago.\n\nDo major technology companies have liberal or conservative biases?\n\nOverall, Americans are more likely to think Big Tech companies support the views of liberals over conservatives than the other way around. More than four-in-ten U.S. adults (44%) think major technology companies support the views of liberals over conservatives. Far fewer \u2013 15% \u2013 say these companies support conservative views over liberal ones. Still, a notable share (37%) thinks this industry equally values conservative and liberal viewpoints.\n\nViews by party\n\nRepublicans widely believe that major tech companies have a pro-liberal bias. Fully 71% of Republicans say major technology companies support the views of liberals over conservatives. Much smaller shares believe these companies support the views of liberals and conservatives equally (22%) or favor conservative beliefs over liberal ones (6%).\n\nBy contrast, the most commonly held view among Democrats is that technology companies support the views of conservatives and liberals equally, with 50% saying this. Roughly a quarter of Democrats either say that these companies favor the views of conservatives over liberals (25%) or liberals over conservatives (22%).\n\nWhile there\u2019s been little change in views since 2022, there are some differences when comparing today\u2019s views to those in 2018, when we first started asking these questions.\n\nOver the past six years, a rising share of Republicans say major tech companies favor liberal over conservative views (71% today vs. 64% in 2018), while more Democrats today than in the past think these companies support conservative views more than liberal ones (25% today vs. 16% in 2018).\n\nGovernment regulation of technology companies\n\nAmid concerns over free speech, social media\u2019s impact on youth and AI\u2019s impending foothold, lawmakers and advocates on both sides of the political aisle have pushed for more government oversight of the tech industry.\n\nBut there\u2019s a long-running debate about what role the government should play in regulating Big Tech. We wanted to know where Americans stand, how views have changed over time, and whether opinions vary by party.\n\nAmericans favor more rather than less regulation of Big Tech companies. When asked whether the government should regulate major technology companies more, less or at its current level, 51% believe these companies should be regulated more than they are now. Far fewer \u2013 16% \u2013 feel they should be regulated less than they are now.\n\nStill, 31% say their current level of regulation should stay the same.\n\nSupport for more government regulation of technology companies is identical to what it was in 2018. Support for more regulation has risen and fallen somewhat over the past six years, ranging from 44% in 2022 to 56% in 2021. The share of Americans who think these companies should be regulated more than they are now is identical to what the Center found in 2018, when we first asked the question. At the same time, the share who say there should be less regulation has increased from 9% in 2018 to 16% today.\n\nViews by party\n\nDemocrats are more supportive of increased government oversight of tech companies than are Republicans. Six-in-ten Democrats say the government should regulate major technology companies more than it is now, compared with 45% of Republicans.\n\nThe partisan gap between Democrats and Republicans is similar to that in 2022. But these differences have not always been large. For instance, similar shares of Republicans (48%) and Democrats (46%) favored more regulation of technology companies back in 2020.",

        "text": "How Trump 2.0 could transform DOE\nMore oil and gas permitting. Aggressive deregulation. Federal career staff relegated to the sidelines.\n\nThat\u2019s the vision for American energy policy if former President Donald Trump wins the election in November, according to multiple conservative lobbyists and advocates who either served in the Trump administration or are angling for positions in a potential second one.\n\nIn interviews with E&E News, they said a second Trump term would mean regulatory rollbacks at EPA for power plants and cars, and a green light at the Interior Department for more fossil fuel development on public lands. The vision for Trump 2.0 gets murkier at the Department of Energy, which is releasing billions of dollars in grants from the Inflation Reduction Act and 2021 infrastructure law and helping to craft green tax breaks that many fossil fuel companies like.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat could make rolling back the law\u2019s clean energy provisions \u2014 which have been attacked by many Republicans \u2014 a challenge.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a noticeable difference between DOE and EPA slash Interior,\u201d George David Banks, a former Trump White House climate adviser, said in an interview. \u201cThe low-carbon technology programs have a lot of support.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, the conservative Heritage Foundation has been pushing Project 2025, a sprawling wish list of free market policies written by more than 100 conservative organizations with ties to Trump. It calls for repeal of the IRA and the infrastructure law, along with the elimination of DOE\u2019s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, the Loan Programs Office and the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, among others.\n\n\u201cDOE, instead of focusing on core energy and security issues, has been spending billions of taxpayer dollars to subsidize renewable energy developers and investors, thereby making Americans less energy secure and distorting energy markets,\u201d Bernard McNamee, a former commissioner nominated by Trump to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, wrote in the Project 2025 energy section.\n\n\u201cEnding taxpayer subsidies will promote an \u2018all-of-the-above\u2019 energy policy, lead to more energy resources, reduce costs, and save taxpayers billions of dollars,\u201d he said.\n\nWhich vision might prevail is unclear, but Trump veterans agree that if elected, their former boss would likely deploy measures to slow down uptake of electric vehicles and wind power \u2014 technologies he\u2019s repeatedly lambasted in the past. On the fossil fuel side, observers say the DOE pause on new approvals of liquefied natural gas exports would be in the trash bin on the first day of another Trump administration. That\u2019s likely to coincide with efforts to roll back or delay emission-cutting regulations and scrap DOE programs supporting low-carbon energy.\n\nU.S. participation in the Paris climate accord also would likely end, something Trump did in his first term.\n\nBut one of the biggest factors shaping the energy sector \u2014 IRA and infrastructure law money, and what DOE does with it \u2014 is a wild card. If a Trump win came with full Republican control of Congress in November, those laws could be on the chopping block. But with Republicans in disarray in the House, a full IRA repeal could be a long shot, giving the next administration leeway on how to spend millions of dollars in the energy sector.\n\nTravis Fisher, an IRA critic at the Cato Institute and a Trump DOE veteran who clashed with department leadership over a coal plant bailout plan, said Congress would nonetheless be in the driver\u2019s seat on fiscal policy, pointing to Trump proposed budget cuts that didn\u2019t materialize in appropriations legislation. That pattern could reappear in a second Trump term, even beyond IRA spending, he said.\n\n\u201cCongress would year after year increase the budget\u201d despite Trump\u2019s proposed cuts, Fisher said. \u201cI would expect the same thing again.\u201d\n\nLNG, loans and lightbulbs\n\nFor its part, the Trump campaign has released limited details on energy policies, vowing to \u201cunleash the production of domestic energy resources\u201d and \u201celiminate the socialist Green New Deal.\u201d The campaign did not grant E&E News an interview.\n\nTrump veterans say the campaign is not likely to expound much more.\n\n\u201cI doubt that the campaign will get hypertechnical on what they want to nail down,\u201d said Dan Simmons, former assistant secretary for the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy during the Trump administration. \u201cEspecially as oil prices continue to go up in recent months, I expect President Trump to focus on the value of domestic oil and gas production and the benefits that it brings America.\u201d\n\nEven with scant details, Trump veterans are forecasting significant changes to DOE programs and agency staffing if Biden loses in November.\n\nDavid Solan, the former deputy assistant secretary for renewable power at DOE under Trump, predicted the DOE loan office would be \u201cmore active\u201d than Trump\u2019s first term. It \u201cmight be more concentrated in looking at things like the nuclear sector, maybe critical minerals, more utility-scale [storage] than EV-type storage,\u201d he said on an April webinar run by the think tank Conservative Coalition for Climate Solutions. The loan office currently has more than $200 billion in lending authority, much of which will be left for 2025 and beyond.\n\nBanks, Trump\u2019s former climate adviser, said Biden\u2019s LNG pause \u201cwill be thrown out the window \u2014 no question about that.\u201d\n\nTrump is also expected to target DOE\u2019s efficiency regulations for appliances and other electrical equipment, a big priority for Biden. It\u2019s a program Trump turned political in the past, criticizing showerhead rules and saying in 2019 that efficient light-emitting diode lightbulbs made him \u201clook orange.\u201d\n\nTrump could try and delay rules and issue new ones, but he also faces a statutory problem. The law that authorized the program, which the Biden administration credits with billions of tons of averted emissions, prevents DOE from issuing new regulations that are weaker than existing ones.\n\n\u201cA new Trump administration can crank the ratchet down further, but they can\u2019t loosen the standards,\u201d said Simmons. \u201cThat\u2019s a critically important part of the appliance standards process and regulations.\u201d\n\nWith lightbulbs, another factor for Trump is that LEDs are more dominant in the market than they were in 2016 after the Biden administration finalized new regulations.\n\nTrump allies and other observers also expect conflict with career staff at federal agencies.\n\n\u201cThe lack of alignment between newly minted Trump officials and career executive branch employees with decades of experience is going to cause untold friction and frustration [about climate change and clean energy] to the Trump appointees and the career officials,\u201d said Alex Flint, head of the pro-carbon tax group Alliance for Market Solutions and a member of Trump\u2019s 2016 transition team.\n\nSteve Milloy, a Trump EPA transition team member in 2016, said career staff were \u201callowed to interfere too much.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis time it will be different. I don\u2019t think the staff will be allowed to interfere,\u201d Milloy said.\n\nBut with tens of thousands of career staff in Washington, that could be a major challenge.\n\n\u201cThe employees at the DOE, in my experience, were somewhere between antagonistic and outwardly hostile,\u201d said Fisher. \u201cThe Trump team has their work cut out for them. We\u2019ll see how it goes.\u201d\n\n\u2018All this stuff is going to have to be rolled back\u2019\n\nThe blueprints of another prominent conservative group echo parts of Project 2025, suggesting there is agreement among Republican supporters on many free-market energy policies.\n\nThe America First Policy Institute, founded in 2021 to support Trump, calls for more fossil fuel leasing, critical mineral projects, and nuclear research and development, for example. It criticizes Biden for \u201ca myopic focus on climate change as a justification for its sweeping radical agenda and massive government expansion.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe government has a spending problem. Period,\u201d said Oliver McPherson-Smith, director for the Center for Energy & Environment at AFPI, in an interview. \u201cWe need to go line by line \u2014 every single project, every single program \u2014 and question whether this is a responsible use of federal taxpayer money. We also need to question whether any of this funding could benefit or flow to the Chinese Communist Party.\u201d\n\nOther conservatives, including Trump veterans, agree.\n\nTom Pyle, president of the pro-fossil fuel American Energy Alliance and a DOE transition team member in 2016-17, said \u201cwe had a plan to radically restructure the organization and get it out of the business of picking energy winners and losers through the deployment of federal money.\u201d For example, Trump proposed eliminating DOE\u2019s Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, which funds cutting-edge energy technologies. The agency survived \u2014 and saw its funding increase \u2014 because of support in Congress.\n\nPyle urged a similar plan to cut DOE programs but said Congress would be the decider.\n\nHe said Trump has \u201ca very clear vision about U.S. energy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not very complicated. He\u2019s for it. All of it,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat Trump is not expected to support are programs that specifically mention climate, despite the globe hitting record high temperatures last year. Scientists say temperature rise is expected to easily pass global targets absent major changes in energy production, creating more severe weather, which in turn, could spark problems ranging from mass migration to food shortages.\n\nTrump\u2019s allies claim Biden\u2019s low-carbon policies won\u2019t actually help the climate.\n\n\u201cAll this stuff is going to have to be rolled back. It doesn\u2019t do anything for the environment. It just costs a lot of money,\u201d said Milloy. \u201cThe Trump administration is not going to be an administration that worries about carbon dioxide emissions.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a stance that worries environmentalists and Democrats. Multiple reports, including research from Princeton University researchers, have concluded that emissions would decrease in the coming years due in large part to the IRA and infrastructure law investments.\n\nSeth Schuster, a spokesperson for the Biden campaign, said the president has \u201cdelivered the most ambitious climate change in history, lowering energy bills for hardworking families and creating tens of thousands of good-paying jobs across the country. Donald Trump \u2014 who calls climate change a hoax \u2014 is promising to gut the IRA and take a sledgehammer to that progress.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Kevin Curtis, executive director of the Natural Resources Defense Council Action Fund, said \u201cslamming the brakes on an American manufacturing boom just to benefit Trump\u2019s fossil fuel industry patrons hurts people and is also politically stupid.\u201d\n\nClean energy tax credits are reinvigorating communities and \u201cdelivering real dividends for Americans in states red and blue,\u201d he said.\n\nSupport for the climate law?\n\nDespite the push from Project 2025, some Trump loyalists say the former president would be reluctant to trash many of the energy grants and tax credits that are fueling economic activity.\n\n\u201cIndustry is moving forward with projects. They\u2019re relying on funding, loan guarantees, tax credits and the like,\u201d said a former Trump administration official, who was granted anonymity to speak freely about a possible second term. \u201cIf you come in and you try to yank that back or renege on contracts, that can get you snared in litigation.\u201d\n\nThe Biden energy agenda has spurred $120 billion in clean energy investments, creating more than 100,000 jobs, according to clean energy group E2. At DOE, nearly $100 billion is expected to subsidize projects on hydrogen energy, carbon capture and sequestration, battery storage, and a range of other technologies.\n\nAll told, the funding from three Biden-era laws has gone to more Republican districts than Democratic ones, according to a review by E&E News.\n\nAlong with renewable and climate groups, the funding is backed by many fossil fuel interests.\n\nIn an interview last month at the CERAWeek energy conference in Houston, American Petroleum Institute President Mike Sommers said he\u2019d \u201cwork vigorously to ensure that the provisions that we support in the IRA sustain during a potential Trump administration,\u201d most notably the tax credits for hydrogen and carbon capture.\n\nWith the election looming, federal agencies in Washington are finalizing tax rules from the IRA and racing to get the grant money out the door.\n\nSolan, who is now an expert in residence at nonprofit clean energy consultancy BRITE, co-authored a report last month on DOE modernization, which he said was meant to \u201cget the attention of a potential Republican administration.\u201d The report, which was released by the conservative energy group Clearpath, called for overhauling DOE\u2019s organizational structure in the wake of the IRA and other federal laws.\n\n\u201cWith all the resources that DOE has, it\u2019s really important that progress be made,\u201d Solan said on the April webinar. \u201cIt is important to the United States to be the world leader in energy.\u201d",

        "text": "Voters\u2019 views of Trump and Biden differ sharply by religion\nThe U.S. electorate continues to be sharply divided along religious lines.\n\nThe latest Pew Research Center survey finds that most registered voters who are White Christians would vote for Republican Donald Trump over Democrat Joe Biden if the 2024 presidential election were held today. More than half of White Christians think Trump was a \u201cgreat\u201d or \u201cgood\u201d president and don\u2019t think he broke the law in an effort to change the outcome of the 2020 election.\n\nIn stark contrast, most registered voters who are Black Protestants or religious \u201cnones\u201d \u2013 those who self-identify as atheists, agnostics or \u201cnothing in particular\u201d \u2013 would vote for Biden over Trump. Large numbers in these groups also say Trump was a \u201cterrible\u201d president and that he broke the law trying to overturn the 2020 election results.\n\nHow we did this Pew Research Center conducted this analysis to highlight religious differences in U.S. voters\u2019 views about the 2024 presidential election. For this analysis, we surveyed 8,709 adults \u2013 including 7,166 registered voters \u2013 from April 8 to 14, 2024. Everyone who took part in this survey is a member of the Center\u2019s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. This way nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. Read more about the ATP\u2019s methodology. Here are the questions used for this report, along with responses, and the survey methodology. Here are details about sample sizes and margins of error for groups analyzed in this report.\n\nReligion and the 2024 presidential election\n\nWhile most White Christian voters say they would vote for Trump over Biden if the election were held today, there are some differences by religious tradition. Trump draws support from:\n\n81% of White evangelical Protestant voters\n\n61% of White Catholics\n\n57% of White Protestants who are not evangelical\n\nBy contrast, 77% of Black Protestant voters say they would vote for Biden over Trump. Most religious \u201cnones\u201d also say this, including:\n\n87% of atheist voters\n\n82% of agnostics\n\n57% of those whose religion is \u201cnothing in particular\u201d\n\nThese presidential preferences reflect the partisan leanings of U.S. religious groups. White Christians have been trending in a Republican direction for quite some time, while Black Protestants and religious \u201cnones\u201d have long been strongly Democratic.\n\nThe Center\u2019s new survey includes responses from Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus and people from many other religious backgrounds, as well as adherents of smaller Christian groups like Hispanic Protestants and members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (widely known as Mormons). However, the survey does not include enough respondents from these smaller religious categories to be able to report on them separately.\n\nChurch attendance and voting preferences in 2024\n\nAmong Christians, support for Trump is somewhat higher among regular church attenders than non-churchgoers. Overall, 62% of Christian voters who say they go to church at least once or twice a month support Trump over Biden. Among Christians who go to church less often, 55% would vote for Trump if the election were today.\n\nAmong White evangelical Protestant voters, 84% of regular churchgoers say they would vote for Trump, compared with 77% of White evangelicals who don\u2019t go to church regularly.\n\nWhite nonevangelical Protestants are the only Christian group in which support for Trump is significantly stronger among nonattenders than among regular churchgoers.\n\nVoters\u2019 views of Biden and Trump as presidents\n\nAbout three-quarters of White evangelical Protestant voters say Trump was a \u201cgreat\u201d (37%) or \u201cgood\u201d (37%) president. Roughly half of White Catholics and White nonevangelical Protestants share this view.\n\nWhen it comes to Biden, atheists and Black Protestants rate the current president\u2019s performance most favorably. Roughly half of voters in each of these groups say Biden is a great or good president.\n\nOverall, Trump gets higher marks on these questions than Biden. This is because Trump supporters are more inclined to say he was a great or good president than Biden supporters are to say the same about him.\n\nViews of whether Trump broke the law in effort to change 2020 election outcome\n\nPeople in the religious groups that are most supportive of Biden tend to think Trump broke the law in an effort to change the outcome of the 2020 election. Most atheists (83%) say this, as do 70% of Black Protestants and 63% of agnostics.\n\nBy contrast, just 16% of White evangelical Protestants say Trump broke the law trying to change the 2020 election outcome. Another 15% of White evangelicals say they think Trump did something wrong but did not break the law, while the largest share by far (47%) say Trump did nothing wrong.\n\nNote: Here are the questions used for this report, along with responses, and the survey methodology.",

        "text": "How Far Trump Would Go\nThis feature was published in April 2024.\n\nDonald Trump thinks he\u2019s identified a crucial mistake of his first term: He was too nice.\n\nWe\u2019ve been talking for more than an hour on April 12 at his fever-dream palace in Palm Beach. Aides lurk around the perimeter of a gilded dining room overlooking the manicured lawn. When one nudges me to wrap up the interview, I bring up the many former Cabinet officials who refuse to endorse Trump this time. Some have publicly warned that he poses a danger to the Republic. Why should voters trust you, I ask, when some of the people who observed you most closely do not?\n\nAs always, Trump punches back, denigrating his former top advisers. But beneath the typical torrent of invective, there is a larger lesson he has taken away. \u201cI let them quit because I have a heart. I don\u2019t want to embarrass anybody,\u201d Trump says. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll do that again. From now on, I\u2019ll fire.\u201d\n\nSix months from the 2024 presidential election, Trump is better positioned to win the White House than at any point in either of his previous campaigns. He leads Joe Biden by slim margins in most polls, including in several of the seven swing states likely to determine the outcome. But I had not come to ask about the election, the disgrace that followed the last one, or how he has become the first former\u2014and perhaps future\u2014American President to face a criminal trial. I wanted to know what Trump would do if he wins a second term, to hear his vision for the nation, in his own words.\n\nPhotograph by Philip Montgomery for TIME\n\nBuy your copy of this issue here\n\nWhat emerged in two interviews with Trump, and conversations with more than a dozen of his closest advisers and confidants, were the outlines of an imperial presidency that would reshape America and its role in the world. To carry out a deportation operation designed to remove more than 11 million people from the country, Trump told me, he would be willing to build migrant detention camps and deploy the U.S. military, both at the border and inland. He would let red states monitor women\u2019s pregnancies and prosecute those who violate abortion bans. He would, at his personal discretion, withhold funds appropriated by Congress, according to top advisers. He would be willing to fire a U.S. Attorney who doesn\u2019t carry out his order to prosecute someone, breaking with a tradition of independent law enforcement that dates from America\u2019s founding. He is weighing pardons for every one of his supporters accused of attacking the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, more than 800 of whom have pleaded guilty or been convicted by a jury. He might not come to the aid of an attacked ally in Europe or Asia if he felt that country wasn\u2019t paying enough for its own defense. He would gut the U.S. civil service, deploy the National Guard to American cities as he sees fit, close the White House pandemic-preparedness office, and staff his Administration with acolytes who back his false assertion that the 2020 election was stolen.\n\nTrump remains the same guy, with the same goals and grievances. But in person, if anything, he appears more assertive and confident. \u201cWhen I first got to Washington, I knew very few people,\u201d he says. \u201cI had to rely on people.\u201d Now he is in charge. The arranged marriage with the timorous Republican Party stalwarts is over; the old guard is vanquished, and the people who remain are his people. Trump would enter a second term backed by a slew of policy shops staffed by loyalists who have drawn up detailed plans in service of his agenda, which would concentrate the powers of the state in the hands of a man whose appetite for power appears all but insatiable. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big mystery what his agenda would be,\u201d says his close adviser Kellyanne Conway. \u201cBut I think people will be surprised at the alacrity with which he will take action.\u201d\n\nThe crowd at a Trump campaign rally in Schnecksville, Penn., on April 13. Victor J. Blue for TIME\n\nThe courts, the Constitution, and a Congress of unknown composition would all have a say in whether Trump\u2019s objectives come to pass. The machinery of Washington has a range of defenses: leaks to a free press, whistle-blower protections, the oversight of inspectors general. The same deficiencies of temperament and judgment that hindered him in the past remain present. If he wins, Trump would be a lame duck\u2014contrary to the suggestions of some supporters, he tells TIME he would not seek to overturn or ignore the Constitution\u2019s prohibition on a third term. Public opinion would also be a powerful check. Amid a popular outcry, Trump was forced to scale back some of his most draconian first-term initiatives, including the policy of separating migrant families. As George Orwell wrote in 1945, the ability of governments to carry out their designs \u201cdepends on the general temper in the country.\u201d\n\nEvery election is billed as a national turning point. This time that rings true. To supporters, the prospect of Trump 2.0, unconstrained and backed by a disciplined movement of true believers, offers revolutionary promise. To much of the rest of the nation and the world, it represents an alarming risk. A second Trump term could bring \u201cthe end of our democracy,\u201d says presidential historian Douglas Brinkley, \u201cand the birth of a new kind of authoritarian presidential order.\u201d\n\nTrump steps onto the patio at Mar-a-Lago near dusk. The well-heeled crowd eating Wagyu steaks and grilled branzino pauses to applaud as he takes his seat. On this gorgeous evening, the club is a MAGA mecca. Billionaire donor Steve Wynn is here. So is Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, who is dining with the former President after a joint press conference proposing legislation to prevent noncitizens from voting. Their voting in federal elections is already illegal, and extremely rare, but remains a Trumpian fixation that the embattled Speaker appeared happy to co-sign in exchange for the political cover that standing with Trump provides.\n\nAt the moment, though, Trump\u2019s attention is elsewhere. With an index finger, he swipes through an iPad on the table to curate the restaurant\u2019s soundtrack. The playlist veers from Sinead O\u2019Connor to James Brown to The Phantom of the Opera. And there\u2019s a uniquely Trump choice: a rendition of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d sung by a choir of defendants imprisoned for attacking the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, interspersed with a recording of Trump reciting the Pledge of Allegiance. This has become a staple of his rallies, converting the ultimate symbol of national unity into a weapon of factional devotion.\n\nThe spectacle picks up where his first term left off. The events of Jan. 6, during which a pro-Trump mob attacked the center of American democracy in an effort to subvert the peaceful transfer of power, was a profound stain on his legacy. Trump has sought to recast an insurrectionist riot as an act of patriotism. \u201cI call them the J-6 patriots,\u201d he says. When I ask whether he would consider pardoning every one of them, he says, \u201cYes, absolutely.\u201d As Trump faces dozens of felony charges, including for election interference, conspiracy to defraud the United States, willful retention of national-security secrets, and falsifying business records to conceal hush-money payments, he has tried to turn legal peril into a badge of honor.\n\nThe Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol is a profound stain on Trump\u2019s legacy, one that he has sought to recast as an act of patriotism. Victor J. Blue\n\nIn a second term, Trump\u2019s influence on American democracy would extend far beyond pardoning powers. Allies are laying the groundwork to restructure the presidency in line with a doctrine called the unitary executive theory, which holds that many of the constraints imposed on the White House by legislators and the courts should be swept away in favor of a more powerful Commander in Chief.\n\nRead More: Fact-Checking What Donald Trump Said In His Interviews With TIME\n\nNowhere would that power be more momentous than at the Department of Justice. Since the nation\u2019s earliest days, Presidents have generally kept a respectful distance from Senate-confirmed law-enforcement officials to avoid exploiting for personal ends their enormous ability to curtail Americans\u2019 freedoms. But Trump, burned in his first term by multiple investigations directed by his own appointees, is ever more vocal about imposing his will directly on the department and its far-flung investigators and prosecutors.\n\nIn our Mar-a-Lago interview, Trump says he might fire U.S. Attorneys who refuse his orders to prosecute someone: \u201cIt would depend on the situation.\u201d He\u2019s told supporters he would seek retribution against his enemies in a second term. Would that include Fani Willis, the Atlanta-area district attorney who charged him with election interference, or Alvin Bragg, the Manhattan DA in the Stormy Daniels case, who Trump has previously said should be prosecuted? Trump demurs but offers no promises. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to do that,\u201d he says, before adding, \u201cWe\u2019re gonna look at a lot of things. What they\u2019ve done is a terrible thing.\u201d\n\nTrump has also vowed to appoint a \u201creal special prosecutor\u201d to go after Biden. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to hurt Biden,\u201d he tells me. \u201cI have too much respect for the office.\u201d Seconds later, though, he suggests Biden\u2019s fate may be tied to an upcoming Supreme Court ruling on whether Presidents can face criminal prosecution for acts committed in office. \u201cIf they said that a President doesn\u2019t get immunity,\u201d says Trump, \u201cthen Biden, I am sure, will be prosecuted for all of his crimes.\u201d (Biden has not been charged with any, and a House Republican effort to impeach him has failed to unearth evidence of any crimes or misdemeanors, high or low.)\n\nRead More: Trump Says \u2018Anti-White Feeling\u2019 Is a Problem in the U.S.\n\nSuch moves would be potentially catastrophic for the credibility of American law enforcement, scholars and former Justice Department leaders from both parties say. \u201cIf he ordered an improper prosecution, I would expect any respectable U.S. Attorney to say no,\u201d says Michael McConnell, a former U.S. appellate judge appointed by President George W. Bush. \u201cIf the President fired the U.S. Attorney, it would be an enormous firestorm.\u201d McConnell, now a Stanford law professor, says the dismissal could have a cascading effect similar to the Saturday Night Massacre, when President Richard Nixon ordered top DOJ officials to remove the special counsel investigating Watergate. Presidents have the constitutional right to fire U.S. Attorneys, and typically replace their predecessors\u2019 appointees upon taking office. But discharging one specifically for refusing a President\u2019s order would be all but unprecedented.\n\nThe U.S. border fence in Sunland Park, N.M.. Victor J. Blue\n\nTrump\u2019s radical designs for presidential power would be felt throughout the country. A main focus is the southern border. Trump says he plans to sign orders to reinstall many of the same policies from his first term, such as the Remain in Mexico program, which requires that non-Mexican asylum seekers be sent south of the border until their court dates, and Title 42, which allows border officials to expel migrants without letting them apply for asylum. Advisers say he plans to cite record border crossings and fentanyl- and child-trafficking as justification for reimposing the emergency measures. He would direct federal funding to resume construction of the border wall, likely by allocating money from the military budget without congressional approval. The capstone of this program, advisers say, would be a massive deportation operation that would target millions of people. Trump made similar pledges in his first term, but says he plans to be more aggressive in a second. \u201cPeople need to be deported,\u201d says Tom Homan, a top Trump adviser and former acting head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. \u201cNo one should be off the table.\u201d\n\nRead More: The Story Behind TIME's 'If He Wins' Trump Cover\n\nFor an operation of that scale, Trump says he would rely mostly on the National Guard to round up and remove undocumented migrants throughout the country. \u201cIf they weren\u2019t able to, then I\u2019d use [other parts of] the military,\u201d he says. When I ask if that means he would override the Posse Comitatus Act\u2014an 1878 law that prohibits the use of military force on civilians\u2014Trump seems unmoved by the weight of the statute. \u201cWell, these aren\u2019t civilians,\u201d he says. \u201cThese are people that aren\u2019t legally in our country.\u201d He would also seek help from local police and says he would deny funding for jurisdictions that decline to adopt his policies. \u201cThere\u2019s a possibility that some won\u2019t want to participate,\u201d Trump says, \u201cand they won\u2019t partake in the riches.\u201d\n\nAs President, Trump nominated three Supreme Court Justices who voted to overturn Roe v. Wade, and he claims credit for his role in ending a constitutional right to an abortion. At the same time, he has sought to defuse a potent campaign issue for the Democrats by saying he wouldn\u2019t sign a federal ban. In our interview at Mar-a-Lago, he declines to commit to vetoing any additional federal restrictions if they came to his desk. More than 20 states now have full or partial abortion bans, and Trump says those policies should be left to the states to do what they want, including monitoring women\u2019s pregnancies. \u201cI think they might do that,\u201d he says. When I ask whether he would be comfortable with states prosecuting women for having abortions beyond the point the laws permit, he says, \u201cIt\u2019s irrelevant whether I\u2019m comfortable or not. It\u2019s totally irrelevant, because the states are going to make those decisions.\u201d President Biden has said he would fight state anti-abortion measures in court and with regulation.\n\nTrump\u2019s allies don\u2019t plan to be passive on abortion if he returns to power. The Heritage Foundation has called for enforcement of a 19th century statute that would outlaw the mailing of abortion pills. The Republican Study Committee (RSC), which includes more than 80% of the House GOP conference, included in its 2025 budget proposal the Life at Conception Act, which says the right to life extends to \u201cthe moment of fertilization.\u201d I ask Trump if he would veto that bill if it came to his desk. \u201cI don\u2019t have to do anything about vetoes,\u201d Trump says, \u201cbecause we now have it back in the states.\u201d\n\nPresidents typically have a narrow window to pass major legislation. Trump\u2019s team is eyeing two bills to kick off a second term: a border-security and immigration package, and an extension of his 2017 tax cuts. Many of the latter\u2019s provisions expire early in 2025: the tax cuts on individual income brackets, 100% business expensing, the doubling of the estate-tax deduction. Trump is planning to intensify his protectionist agenda, telling me he\u2019s considering a tariff of more than 10% on all imports, and perhaps even a 100% tariff on some Chinese goods. Trump says the tariffs will liberate the U.S. economy from being at the mercy of foreign manufacturing and spur an industrial renaissance in the U.S. When I point out that independent analysts estimate Trump\u2019s first term tariffs on thousands of products, including steel and aluminum, solar panels, and washing machines, may have cost the U.S. $316 billion and more than 300,000 jobs, by one account, he dismisses these experts out of hand. His advisers argue that the average yearly inflation rate in his first term\u2014under 2%\u2014is evidence that his tariffs won\u2019t raise prices.\n\nSince leaving office, Trump has tried to engineer a caucus of the compliant, clearing primary fields in Senate and House races. His hope is that GOP majorities replete with MAGA diehards could rubber-stamp his legislative agenda and nominees. Representative Jim Banks of Indiana, a former RSC chairman and the GOP nominee for the state\u2019s open Senate seat, recalls an August 2022 RSC planning meeting with Trump at his residence in Bedminster, N.J. As the group arrived, Banks recalls, news broke that Mar-a-Lago had been raided by the FBI. Banks was sure the meeting would be canceled. Moments later, Trump walked through the doors, defiant and pledging to run again. \u201cI need allies there when I\u2019m elected,\u201d Banks recalls Trump saying. The difference in a second Trump term, Banks says now, \u201cis he\u2019s going to have the backup in Congress that he didn\u2019t have before.\u201d\n\nHaley, Scavino, Wiles: AP (3); Bannon, Conway, Homan, LaCivita, Lighthizer, J. Miller, S. Miller, Trump, Vought: Getty Images (9)\n\nTrump\u2019s intention to remake America\u2019s relations abroad may be just as consequential. Since its founding, the U.S. has sought to build and sustain alliances based on the shared values of political and economic freedom. Trump takes a much more transactional approach to international relations than his predecessors, expressing disdain for what he views as free-riding friends and appreciation for authoritarian leaders like President Xi Jinping of China, Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary, or former President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil.\n\nThat\u2019s one reason America\u2019s traditional allies were horrified when Trump recently said at a campaign rally that Russia could \u201cdo whatever the hell they want\u201d to a NATO country he believes doesn\u2019t spend enough on collective defense. That wasn\u2019t idle bluster, Trump tells me. \u201cIf you\u2019re not going to pay, then you\u2019re on your own,\u201d he says. Trump has long said the alliance is ripping the U.S. off. Former NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg credited Trump\u2019s first-term threat to pull out of the alliance with spurring other members to add more than $100 billion to their defense budgets.\n\nBut an insecure NATO is as likely to accrue to Russia\u2019s benefit as it is to America\u2019s. President Vladimir Putin\u2019s 2022 invasion of Ukraine looks to many in Europe and the U.S. like a test of his broader vision to reconstruct the Soviet empire. Under Biden and a bipartisan Congress, the U.S. has sent more than $100 billion to Ukraine to defend itself. It\u2019s unlikely Trump would extend the same support to Kyiv. After Orban visited Mar-a-Lago in March, he said Trump \u201cwouldn\u2019t give a penny\u201d to Ukraine. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t give unless Europe starts equalizing,\u201d Trump hedges in our interview. \u201cIf Europe is not going to pay, why should we pay? They\u2019re much more greatly affected. We have an ocean in between us. They don\u2019t.\u201d (E.U. nations have given more than $100 billion in aid to Ukraine as well.)\n\nRead More: Read the Full Transcripts of Donald Trump's Interviews With TIME\n\nTrump has historically been reluctant to criticize or confront Putin. He sided with the Russian autocrat over his own intelligence community when it asserted that Russia interfered in the 2016 election. Even now, Trump uses Putin as a foil for his own political purposes. When I asked Trump why he has not called for the release of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, who has been unjustly held on spurious charges in a Moscow prison for a year, Trump says, \u201cI guess because I have so many other things I\u2019m working on.\u201d Gershkovich should be freed, he adds, but he doubts it will happen before the election. \u201cThe reporter should be released and he will be released,\u201d Trump tells me. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he\u2019s going to be released under Biden. I would get him released.\u201d\n\nAmerica\u2019s Asian allies, like its European ones, may be on their own under Trump. Taiwan\u2019s Foreign Minister recently said aid to Ukraine was critical in deterring Xi from invading the island. Communist China\u2019s leaders \u201chave to understand that things like that can\u2019t come easy,\u201d Trump says, but he declines to say whether he would come to Taiwan\u2019s defense.\n\nTrump is less cryptic on current U.S. troop deployments in Asia. If South Korea doesn\u2019t pay more to support U.S. troops there to deter Kim Jong Un\u2019s increasingly belligerent regime to the north, Trump suggests the U.S. could withdraw its forces. \u201cWe have 40,000 troops that are in a precarious position,\u201d he tells TIME. (The number is actually 28,500.) \u201cWhich doesn\u2019t make any sense. Why would we defend somebody? And we\u2019re talking about a very wealthy country.\u201d\n\nTransactional isolationism may be the main strain of Trump\u2019s foreign policy, but there are limits. Trump says he would join Israel\u2019s side in a confrontation with Iran. \u201cIf they attack Israel, yes, we would be there,\u201d he tells me. He says he has come around to the now widespread belief in Israel that a Palestinian state existing side by side in peace is increasingly unlikely. \u201cThere was a time when I thought two-state could work,\u201d he says. \u201cNow I think two-state is going to be very, very tough.\u201d\n\nYet even his support for Israel is not absolute. He\u2019s criticized Israel\u2019s handling of its war against Hamas, which has killed more than 30,000 Palestinians in Gaza, and has called for the nation to \u201cget it over with.\u201d When I ask whether he would consider withholding U.S. military aid to Israel to push it toward winding down the war, he doesn\u2019t say yes, but he doesn\u2019t rule it out, either. He is sharply critical of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, once a close ally. \u201cI had a bad experience with Bibi,\u201d Trump says. In his telling, a January 2020 U.S. operation to assassinate a top Iranian general was supposed to be a joint attack until Netanyahu backed out at the last moment. \u201cThat was something I never forgot,\u201d he says. He blames Netanyahu for failing to prevent the Oct. 7 attack, when Hamas militants infiltrated southern Israel and killed nearly 1,200 people amid acts of brutality including burning entire families alive and raping women and girls. \u201cIt happened on his watch,\u201d Trump says.\n\nOn the second day of Trump\u2019s New York trial on April 17, I stand behind the packed counter of the Sanaa Convenience Store on 139th Street and Broadway, waiting for Trump to drop in for a postcourt campaign stop. He chose the bodega for its history. In 2022, one of the store\u2019s clerks fatally stabbed a customer who attacked him. Bragg, the Manhattan DA, charged the clerk with second-degree murder. (The charges were later dropped amid public outrage over video footage that appeared to show the clerk acting in self-defense.) A baseball bat behind the counter alludes to lingering security concerns. When Trump arrives, he asks the store\u2019s co-owner, Maad Ahmed, a Yemeni immigrant, about safety. \u201cYou should be allowed to have a gun,\u201d Trump tells Ahmed. \u201cIf you had a gun, you\u2019d never get robbed.\u201d\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump uses crime as a cudgel, painting urban America as a savage hell-scape even though violent crime has declined in recent years, with homicides sinking 6% in 2022 and 13% in 2023, according to the FBI. When I point this out, Trump tells me he thinks the data, which is collected by state and local police departments, is rigged. \u201cIt\u2019s a lie,\u201d he says. He has pledged to send the National Guard into cities struggling with crime in a second term\u2014possibly without the request of governors\u2014and plans to approve Justice Department grants only to cities that adopt his preferred policing methods like stop-and-frisk.\n\nTo critics, Trump\u2019s preoccupation with crime is a racial dog whistle. In polls, large numbers of his supporters have expressed the view that antiwhite racism now represents a greater problem in the U.S. than the systemic racism that has long afflicted Black Americans. When I ask if he agrees, Trump does not dispute this position. \u201cThere is a definite antiwhite feeling in the country,\u201d he tells TIME, \u201cand that can\u2019t be allowed either.\u201d In a second term, advisers say, a Trump Administration would rescind Biden\u2019s Executive Orders designed to boost diversity and racial equity.\n\nA protester confronts members of the Minnesota National Guard after the murder of George Floyd. Victor J. Blue\n\nTrump\u2019s ability to campaign for the White House in the midst of an unprecedented criminal trial is the product of a more professional campaign operation that has avoided the infighting that plagued past versions. \u201cHe has a very disciplined team around him,\u201d says Representative Elise Stefanik of New York. \u201cThat is an indicator of how disciplined and focused a second term will be.\u201d That control now extends to the party writ large. In 2016, the GOP establishment, having failed to derail Trump\u2019s campaign, surrounded him with staff who sought to temper him. Today the party\u2019s permanent class have either devoted themselves to the gospel of MAGA or given up. Trump has cleaned house at the Republican National Committee, installing handpicked leaders\u2014including his daughter-in-law\u2014who have reportedly imposed loyalty tests on prospective job applicants, asking whether they believe the false assertion that the 2020 election was stolen. (The RNC has denied there is a litmus test.) Trump tells me he would have trouble hiring anyone who admits Biden won: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t feel good about it.\u201d\n\nPolicy groups are creating a government-in-waiting full of true believers. The Heritage Foundation\u2019s Project 2025 has drawn up plans for legislation and Executive Orders as it trains prospective personnel for a second Trump term. The Center for Renewing America, led by Russell Vought, Trump\u2019s former director of the Office of Management and Budget, is dedicated to disempowering the so-called administrative state, the collection of bureaucrats with the power to control everything from drug-safety determinations to the contents of school lunches. The America First Policy Institute is a research haven of pro-Trump right-wing populists. America First Legal, led by Trump\u2019s immigration adviser Stephen Miller, is mounting court battles against the Biden Administration.\n\nThe goal of these groups is to put Trump\u2019s vision into action on day one. \u201cThe President never had a policy process that was designed to give him what he actually wanted and campaigned on,\u201d says Vought. \u201c[We are] sorting through the legal authorities, the mechanics, and providing the momentum for a future Administration.\u201d That includes a litany of boundary-pushing right-wing policies, including slashing Department of Justice funding and cutting climate and environmental regulations.\n\nRead More: Fact-Checking What Donald Trump Said in His 2024 Interviews With TIME\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign says he would be the final decision-maker on which policies suggested by these organizations would get implemented. But at the least, these advisers could form the front lines of a planned march against what Trump dubs the Deep State, marrying bureaucratic savvy to their leader\u2019s anti-bureaucratic zeal. One weapon in Trump\u2019s second-term \u201cWar on Washington\u201d is a wonky one: restoring the power of impoundment, which allowed Presidents to withhold congressionally appropriated funds. Impoundment was a favorite maneuver of Nixon, who used his authority to freeze funding for subsidized housing and the Environmental Protection Agency. Trump and his allies plan to challenge a 1974 law that prohibits use of the measure, according to campaign policy advisers.\n\nAnother inside move is the enforcement of Schedule F, which allows the President to fire nonpolitical government officials and which Trump says he would embrace. \u201cYou have some people that are protected that shouldn\u2019t be protected,\u201d he says. A senior U.S. judge offers an example of how consequential such a move could be. Suppose there\u2019s another pandemic, and President Trump wants to push the use of an untested drug, much as he did with hydroxychloroquine during COVID-19. Under Schedule F, if the drug\u2019s medical reviewer at the Food and Drug Administration refuses to sign off on its use, Trump could fire them, and anyone else who doesn\u2019t approve it. The Trump team says the President needs the power to hold bureaucrats accountable to voters. \u201cThe mere mention of Schedule F,\u201d says Vought, \u201censures that the bureaucracy moves in your direction.\u201d\n\nIt can be hard at times to discern Trump\u2019s true intentions. In his interviews with TIME, he often sidestepped questions or answered them in contradictory ways. There\u2019s no telling how his ego and self-destructive behavior might hinder his objectives. And for all his norm-breaking, there are lines he says he won\u2019t cross. When asked if he would comply with all orders upheld by the Supreme Court, Trump says he would.\n\nBut his policy preoccupations are clear and consistent. If Trump is able to carry out a fraction of his goals, the impact could prove as transformative as any presidency in more than a century. \u201cHe\u2019s in full war mode,\u201d says his former adviser and occasional confidant Stephen Bannon. Trump\u2019s sense of the state of the country is \u201cquite apocalyptic,\u201d Bannon says. \u201cThat\u2019s where Trump\u2019s heart is. That\u2019s where his obsession is.\u201d\n\nTrump speaks at his last rally ahead of his criminal trial in Schnecksville, Penn., on April 13. Victor J. Blue for TIME\n\nThese obsessions could once again push the nation to the brink of crisis. Trump does not dismiss the possibility of political violence around the election. \u201cIf we don\u2019t win, you know, it depends,\u201d he tells TIME. \u201cIt always depends on the fairness of the election.\u201d When I ask what he meant when he baselessly claimed on Truth Social that a stolen election \u201callows for the termination of all rules, regulations and articles, even those found in the Constitution,\u201d Trump responded by denying he had said it. He then complained about the \u201cBiden-inspired\u201d court case he faces in New York and suggested that the \u201cfascists\u201d in America\u2019s government were its greatest threat. \u201cI think the enemy from within, in many cases, is much more dangerous for our country than the outside enemies of China, Russia, and various others,\u201d he tells me.\n\nToward the end of our conversation at Mar-a-Lago, I ask Trump to explain another troubling comment he made: that he wants to be dictator for a day. It came during a Fox News town hall with Sean Hannity, who gave Trump an opportunity to allay concerns that he would abuse power in office or seek retribution against political opponents. Trump said he would not be a dictator\u2014\u201cexcept for day one,\u201d he added. \u201cI want to close the border, and I want to drill, drill, drill.\u201d\n\nTrump says that the remark \u201cwas said in fun, in jest, sarcastically.\u201d He compares it to an infamous moment from the 2016 campaign, when he encouraged the Russians to hack and leak Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails. In Trump\u2019s mind, the media sensationalized those remarks too. But the Russians weren\u2019t joking: among many other efforts to influence the core exercise of American democracy that year, they hacked the Democratic National Committee\u2019s servers and disseminated its emails through WikiLeaks.\n\nWhether or not he was kidding about bringing a tyrannical end to our 248-year experiment in democracy, I ask him, Don\u2019t you see why many Americans see such talk of dictatorship as contrary to our most cherished principles? Trump says no. Quite the opposite, he insists. \u201cI think a lot of people like it.\u201d \u2014With reporting by Leslie Dickstein, Simmone Shah, and Julia Zorthian",

Immigration has topped Gallup\u2019s most important problem list four times since 2000 (either alone or tied with another issue) Immigration tied with government as the top issue in December 2023, when number of migrant encounters at southern border set a record for a single month .",
        "text": "Immigration Named Top U.S. Problem for Third Straight Month\nWASHINGTON, D.C. -- A steady 27% of Americans say the most important problem facing the U.S. is immigration, topping Gallup\u2019s open-ended trend for the third consecutive month, the longest stretch for this particular issue in the past 24 years.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nThe latest results are based on an April 1-22 Gallup survey, as elevated numbers of migrants continued to seek entry at the U.S. southern border. Immigration tied with the government as the top issue in December 2023, when the number of migrant encounters at the southern border set a record for a single month. In February, as a bipartisan measure to address the issue failed in the U.S. Senate, immigration overtook the government as the nation\u2019s most important problem and has remained there since.\n\nIn addition to these recent instances, immigration has topped Gallup\u2019s most important problem list four times since 2000 (either alone or tied with another issue), including at several points in 2014, 2018 and 2019. However, 2024 is the first time that immigration has remained the top issue for multiple successive months.\n\nOther issues -- including the economy in general, the government, the Iraq War, inflation, COVID-19, unemployment and terrorism -- have held the top spot more often than immigration since Gallup began updating the most important problem question monthly in March 2001. Except for inflation and unemployment, all of the other issues have had longer consecutive runs as the top issue than immigration currently has.\n\nThe economy has been the top problem far more often than any other issue (101 times over the past 24 years), while the government has held the top spot 85 times and the Iraq War registered 50 top appearances.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nImmigration Is Most Politically Polarizing Issue on Most Important Problem List\n\nRepublicans are far more likely than Democrats and independents to name immigration as the most important issue. In the latest poll, 48% of Republicans, compared with 8% of Democrats, mention immigration. Independents fall roughly in the middle, at 25%.\n\nRepublicans\u2019 mention of the issue has come down from February, when a record-high 57% named it. Fewer Democrats now than in 2019 (when as many as 20% mentioned it) say immigration is the top problem. Meanwhile, independents\u2019 latest mention of immigration is at a new high, although statistically similar readings were recorded in 2019 and in recent months.\n\nThe most important problem question is open-ended, allowing respondents to name up to three issues. Variation in the percentage of total mentions each month, generally ranging between 108% and 168% in the trend since 2000, creates additional possible error in how historical percentages (overall and by subgroup) should be interpreted.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nHistorically, Republicans have been much more likely than Democrats and independents to mention immigration as the biggest problem facing the U.S. The current 40-percentage-point gap in Republicans\u2019 and Democrats\u2019 mentions of immigration is among the largest party differences on record for this measure. It is identical to last month\u2019s gap and second to February\u2019s 47-point partisan difference on the same issue.\n\nExamining Gallup\u2019s most important problem trends by party shows that immigration is currently a uniquely polarizing issue. The gaps between Republicans and Democrats mentioning it this year are greater than for any other issue in the past 25 years.\n\nThe next most polarizing issue was the COVID-19 pandemic, which was named by far more Democrats (43%) than Republicans (8%) in February 2021, resulting in a 35-point gap. The Iraq War, the government and unemployment were also named by more Democrats than Republicans in past surveys, showing 20- to 24-point gaps. Terrorism was an especially Republican-centric concern, with a 20-point gap in September 2004.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nOther problems have been cited by more Americans overall, although there was more agreement among partisans on their importance. For example, during the Great Recession, Democrats\u2019 and Republicans\u2019 mentions of the economy were similarly elevated. Likewise, after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, mentions of terrorism increased among both parties.\n\nBottom Line\n\nFor the third month in a row, immigration is the problem Americans name more than any other as the most important facing the U.S. While immigration has not ranked as the top problem often in Gallup\u2019s monthly trend, it stands alone as the most politically polarizing issue in the past 25 years of Gallup\u2019s measurement.\n\nThe record surge of migrants at the southern U.S. border in December brought even more focus on the issue -- and while attempted crossings have eased slightly since then, they are expected to increase as spring continues. President Joe Biden\u2019s approval rating for his handling of immigration has been persistently poor. With the presidential election about six months away and immigration top of mind, the issue remains a significant vulnerability for Biden as he seeks reelection.\n\nTo stay up to date with the latest Gallup News insights and updates, follow us on X.\n\nLearn more about how the Gallup Poll Social Series works.\n\nView complete question responses and trends (PDF download).\n\n###Embeddable###",

        "text": "Trump may get another chance to be president. He's planning an aggressive second term\nTrump may get another chance to be president. He's planning an aggressive second term\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Wilfredo Lee/AP Wilfredo Lee/AP\n\nDonald Trump has already been president once, and has been outspoken about the policies he would support and enact if elected again in November.\n\nHe's promised mass deportations of millions of migrants and suggested the United States would not defend foreign allies from aggression in certain circumstances. He's vowed to eviscerate the federal bureaucracy and staff those career civil service roles with political loyalists, use law enforcement to target foes, and painted a dire picture of America's future if he does not return to the White House.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIn two wide-ranging interviews with TIME Magazine published Tuesday, Trump expanded upon that vision for a second term, which would buck traditional conservative viewpoints about the role of government and expand the powers of the presidency that he would then wield against a wide range of groups in America.\n\nTrump touched on a number of topics that are important factors to voters ahead of November, like abortion, crime and the U.S.-Mexico border. Trump also made eyebrow-raising comments about political violence, using the military against civilians and about the multiple criminal cases against him.\n\nHere's a few takeaways from one of the few longform interviews Trump has given this election cycle:\n\nAbortion\n\nOne of the biggest flashpoints in politics the last few years has been abortion access, following the U.S. Supreme Court's decision overturning Roe v. Wade.\n\nTrump has largely sidestepped questions about what specific policy he would support as president, and continued to do so in the TIME interview, arguing that the decisions are now made at the state level.\n\n\"I won't have to commit to [federal abortion restrictions] because it'll never \u2014 number one, it'll never happen,\" Trump said in the interview transcript. \"Number two, it's about states' rights. You don't want to go back into the federal government.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nTrump also deflected on a question about access to abortion pills, promising to release a statement on that \"over the next 14 days.\"\n\nThat's an important question to answer, and one with great political consequence. As NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben has reported, Trump allies are pushing for him to enforce the Comstock Act, a 19th century law that could be used to halt the mailing of abortion pills and essentially stop all abortion in the U.S.\n\nThe former president insisted that it was up to states to make all decisions about abortion, including if they would monitor pregnancies to know if someone has an abortion or prosecuting them.\n\n\"It's irrelevant whether I'm comfortable or not,\" Trump said of the prosecution of women for having abortions. \"It's totally irrelevant, because the states are going to make those decisions.\"\n\nSo far, voters have sided with abortion rights advocates every time the issue has been placed on the ballot, and several states \u2014 like Florida, where Trump lives \u2014 will have similar questions on the ballot this year. He declined to indicate how he will vote on that issue in November as well.\n\nImmigration\n\nTrump's aggressive stance on immigration is a cornerstone of his 2024 campaign, as well as a key issue for many Republican primary voters. But it's not just Republicans that have concerns about the U.S.-Mexico border, making Trump's pronouncements about immigration and migrants especially noteworthy.\n\nIn campaign stump speeches, Trump has vowed to enact \"the largest domestic deportation operation\" in history and roll back virtually every Biden administration policy around the border. He continues to equate immigrants with crime, often mentioning murders and other grisly crimes committed by noncitizens as evidence that a crackdown is needed under his watch.\n\nIn the TIME interview, Trump takes that rhetoric a step further, suggesting he would use the National Guard and the U.S. military to go after migrants, potentially in violation of the Posse Comitatus Act that prevents federal troops from being used against civilians. When asked about that provision, he falsely said people in the country illegally \"aren't civilians\" and would not rule out constructing additional migrant detention camps.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nPolitical violence, law enforcement and criminal indictments\n\nTrump once said on Sean Hannity's show that he would not want to be a dictator \"except for day one: I want to close the border, and I want to drill, drill, drill.\" Like many of his inflammatory claims, Trump said it was meant sarcastically as a joke, but it's just a small part of the aggrieved view he would bring to law enforcement in a second term.\n\nIn the interview, Trump claimed that a lot of people \"like\" language about being a dictator, and did not understand why anyone took it as anything other than a jest.\n\nTrump said he is not worried about political violence in this year's presidential election, but implied it would be because he is victorious in November.\n\n\"Well, I do think we're gonna win. We're way ahead. I don't think they'll be able to do the things that they did the last time, which were horrible. Absolutely horrible. So many, so many different things they did, which were in total violation of what was supposed to be happening. And you know that and everybody knows that. We can recite them, go down a list that would be an arm's long. But I don't think we're going to have that. I think we're going to win. And if we don't win, you know, it depends. It always depends on the fairness of an election. I don't believe they'll be able to do the things that they did the last time. I don't think they'll be able to get away with it. And if that's the case, we're gonna win in record-setting fashion.\"\n\nHe faces multiple criminal trials in several states, including charges of federal election interference stemming from a hush money payment made to adult film star Stormy Daniels that he is facing trial for in New York currently; and a racketeering case in Georgia stemming from his failed efforts to overturn his 2020 defeat there, and more than 800 of his supporters have been sentenced for various crimes stemming from the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection attempt at the U.S. Capitol seeking to stop the transfer of power to President Biden.\n\nTrump repeated that he would consider pardoning those supporters.\n\nAt several times over the last few years, Trump has suggested he would go after political opponents and seek to prosecute them, ranging from Biden to local district attorneys that do not align with his views on crime.\n\nIn the interview, Trump said he would not go after Biden, but if the Supreme Court did not find presidential immunity applied to Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election, then Biden would be \"prosecuted for all of his crimes, because he's committed many crimes.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThere's no criminal charges currently pending against Biden, and a year-long effort to impeach the president over alleged improper business dealings with his son Hunter has stalled with no evidence of crimes.\n\nIf elected again, Trump would gut the federal bureaucracy and remake it in his ideological view, using something called Schedule F to fire career nonpartisan civil servants. A similar purge and rebuilding of the Republican National Committee and several key state Republican parties has taken place in recent years, with Trump's daughter-in-law Lara leading the RNC alongside former North Carolina GOP Chair Michael Whatley.\n\nTrump said in the interview he would not hire anyone who believed Biden won the 2020 election, continuing to repeat false claims that voter fraud cost him the presidency but saw Republicans elected up and down the ballot in key states.",

I think we're going to win,\" Trump told Time magazine in a cover story published on Tuesday.\n\nHe had been asked about an earlier comment to Time that \"I think we're gonna have a big victory and I think there will be no violence\" -- but \"what if you don't win, sir?\" the Time reporter said.\n\n\"If we don't win, you know, it depends. It always depends on the fairness of an election,\" Trump went on to say.\n\nHe has previously warned of problems if things go wrong for him, writing on social media last year, before he faced any of his four criminal indictments, that \"false\" charges against him would bring \"potential death & destruction.\" (He denies all wrongdoing.)\n\nAnd in March, during a campaign rally, as he talked about the auto industry, Trump said that the country would face a broader \"bloodbath\" if he's not elected in November.\n\nSpeaking with Time for the new cover story, he alluded to his frequent, evidence-free claims of widespread election fraud and said, \"I don't believe they'll be able to do the things that they did the last time. I don't think they'll be able to get away with it.

The Department of Justice said this month that nearly 1,400 people have been charged in connection with the attack, including 129 people accused of \"using a deadly or dangerous weapon or causing serious bodily injury to an officer.\"\n\nApproximately 800 people have pleaded guilty to their charges and another 156 people have been convicted at trial, according to the DOJ.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump sits in the courtroom during his hush money trial at Manhattan criminal court, Apr. 26, 2024, in New York City.

I think it's a very, very sad thing,\" he said of the rioters whom he has called \"hostages.\" In his Time interviews, he called them \"patriots.\"\n\n\"If somebody was evil and bad, I would look at that differently,\" he noted.\n\nElsewhere in his interviews, Trump claimed that should he win a second term, he would not attempt to defy the Constitution and try to stay in power for longer -- with a third term -- as some have warned.\n\n\"I don't really have a choice, but I would,\" Trump said about retiring after a second term.\n\nHe \"wouldn't be in favor of a challenge\" to the 22nd Amendment, which imposes term limits, he said. \"I intend to serve four years and do a great job.\"\n\nAnd as he continues to focus on a theme of retribution for his supporters and claims of persecution regarding his various legal troubles during his campaign, Trump told Time that as president he might fire U.S. attorneys who refuse his orders to prosecute someone, saying, \"It would depend on the situation.\"\n\nTrump suggested that as president he wouldn't \"want\" to prosecute the district attorneys who have brought cases against him, like Alvin Bragg and Fani Willis, but he did not give a direct answer when asked by Time if he would still order his DOJ to do so.\n\nHe previously said on the campaign trail that Bragg should be prosecuted, but he denied making that comment to Time.\n\n\"We're gonna look at a lot of things like they're looking. What they've done is a terrible thing. No, I don't want to do [prosecute them],\" he told Time, later saying, \"Our retribution is going to be through success of our country.\"\n\nThough Trump has said he would appoint a special prosecutor to \"go after\" the Bidens, he told Time that \"it depends what happens with the Supreme Court,\" as the justices consider whether to grant Trump some immunity from prosecution for conduct while in the White House.\n\n\"A president should have immunity. That includes [Joe] Biden. If they've ruled that they don't have immunity, Biden, probably nothing to do with me, he would be prosecuted,\" Trump told Time, claiming without evidence that Biden has broken the law.\n\nThe Biden campaign attacked Trump's latest comments.\n\n\"Not since the Civil War have freedom and democracy been under assault at home as they are today \u2013 because of Donald Trump,\" Biden campaign spokesperson James Singer said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\n\"Joe Biden believes democracy is still a sacred cause and his campaign is about the future America is going to build together,\" Singer said, \"not one small, weak man's delusion of a dictatorship.\"",

State law requires a person to be a U.S. citizen in order to be eligible to register in South Carolina. This is the core foundation of election integrity and the SEC remains steadfast in protecting our democracy and the sanctity of every vote.\n\nThe SEC is actively auditing voter data through the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) Program database to ensure that only U.S. citizens are included on the active list of registered voters. Regardless of the method of registration, no voter may be registered in South Carolina without signing an oath swearing that they are a citizen of the United States. The auditing process ensures that any bad actors are removed from voter rolls and held accountable through state and federal election law statutes.\n\nTo date, the SEC has not received any specific information that non-U.S. citizens are fraudulently being registered to vote in our state.\n\n\u201cThe SEC will not allow fraudulent voter registration to happen on our watch,\u201d said Howie Knapp, Executive Director of the SEC. \u201cShould we receive or discover information that non-U.S. citizens are being registered to vote in our state, we will immediately report to our law enforcement partners for investigation and prosecution to the fullest extent of the law. The SEC will continue to be vigilant in following our state\u2019s election laws to ensure elections in South Carolina are conducted with integrity.\u201d\n\nTo learn more, download a one-page sheet for facts about voter registration in South Carolina or visit scVOTES.gov.",

A local Republican organization had called for supporters to turn out after Trump complained that few people were protesting the trial.\n\nBanker Garry Farro, who is not accused of wrongdoing, testified on Friday about financial records filed by Trump\u2019s onetime lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen, who prosecutors say helped carry out the scheme.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump is required to attend the trial and has said he could instead be campaigning ahead of his rematch with Democratic President Joe Biden in the Nov. 5 election.\n\nThe criminal case is one of four pending against Trump, but could be the only one to go to trial and result in a verdict before the election.",

        "summary": " The public is encouraged to vote on whether or not to \u201cgo after\u201d the former president of the United States of America, Joe Biden, and the entire Biden family\u2019s . \u201cIf we don\u2019t win, you know, it depends on the others,\u201d he replied: \u201cI\u2019m sure will be prosecuted for all of his own .\u201d He said he would be unlikely to appoint anyone to a second Trump administration who believed Biden had \u201cfelt good about it\u201d",
        "text": "Trump threatens to prosecute Bidens if he\u2019s re-elected unless he gets immunity\nDonald Trump has warned that Joe Biden and his family could face multiple criminal prosecutions once he leaves office unless the US supreme court awards Trump immunity in his own legal battles with the criminal justice system.\n\nIn a sweeping interview with Time magazine, Trump painted a startling picture of his second term, from how he would wield the justice department to hinting he may let states monitor pregnant women to enforce abortion laws.\n\nTrump made the threat against the Biden family in an interview with Eric Cortellessa of Time, in which he shared the outlines of what the magazine called \u201can imperial presidency that would reshape America and its role in the world\u201d.\n\nTrump made a direct connection between his threat to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the Bidens should he win re-election in November with the case currently before the supreme court over his own presidential immunity.\n\nAsked whether he intends to \u201cgo after\u201d the Bidens should he gain a second term in the White House, Trump replied: \u201cIt depends what happens with the supreme court.\u201d\n\nIf the nine justices on the top court \u2013 three of whom were appointed by Trump \u2013 fail to award him immunity from prosecution, Trump said, \u201cthen Biden I am sure will be prosecuted for all of his crimes, because he\u2019s committed many crimes\u201d.\n\nTrump and his Republican backers have long attempted to link Biden to criminal wrongdoing relating to the business affairs of his son Hunter Biden, without unearthing any substantial evidence. Last June, in remarks made at his golf course in Bedminster, New Jersey, Trump threatened to appoint a special prosecutor were he re-elected \u201cto go after the most corrupt president in the history of the United States of America, Joe Biden, and the entire Biden crime family\u201d.\n\nTrump is currently in the thick of four active prosecutions himself, one of which is currently at trial in New York. He is accused of election interference in 2016 tied to hush-money payments to the adult film actor Stormy Daniels.\n\nLast week, the supreme court heard oral arguments in Trump v US in which the former president made a case for broad immunity from prosecution for former presidents including himself. The justices appeared unlikely to grant his request in full, though they sounded willing to consider some degree of immunity for acts carried out as part of official presidential duties.\n\nSeveral of Trump\u2019s comments in the Time interview will ring alarm bells among those concerned with the former president\u2019s increasingly totalitarian bent.\n\nTrump\u2019s remarks raise the specter that, were he granted a second presidential term, he would weaponize the justice department to seek revenge against the Democratic rival who defeated him in 2020.\n\nDespite the violence that erupted on 6 January 2021 at the US Capitol after he refused to accept defeat in the 2020 election, which is the subject of one of two federal prosecutions he is fighting, Trump also declined to promise a peaceful transfer of power should he lose again in November.\n\nAsked by Cortellessa whether there would be political violence should Trump fail to win, he replied: \u201cIf we don\u2019t win, you know, it depends. It always depends on the fairness of an election.\u201d\n\nPouring yet more gasoline on to the fire, Trump not only repeated his falsehood that the 2020 election had been stolen from him, but said he would be unlikely to appoint anyone to a second Trump administration who believed Biden had legitimately prevailed four years ago. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t feel good about it, because I think anybody that doesn\u2019t see that that election was stolen \u2013 you look at the proof,\u201d he said.\n\nOverall, the interview conveys a picture of a second Trump presidency in which the occupant of the Oval Office would be determined to wield executive power unconstrained by any historical norms or respect for long-accepted boundaries.\n\nHis plans to dominate the Department of Justice would see him pardon most of the more than 800 people who have been convicted of rioting on January 6 and summarily fire any US attorney who disobeyed his instructions.\n\nOn abortion, he said that all decision-making power over reproductive rights had been handed to the states following the supreme court\u2019s overturning of the right to a termination in Roe v Wade. He said he might contemplate Republican states putting pregnant women under surveillance to monitor whether they had abortions beyond the state\u2019s designated ban.\n\n\u201cI think they might do that,\u201d Trump said.\n\nSome of his most fearsome policies for a possible Trump 47 presidency concern immigration. He told Time that one of his first priorities would be to initiate a mass deportation of millions of undocumented people.\n\nTo achieve that historically unprecedented goal, he would be prepared to deploy the US military and national guard to secure the border and to carry out massive sweeps of potential deportees. He said he would not rule out building new migrant detention camps to house those earmarked for removal, though most of the deportations would happen instantly.",

        "text": "Former Attorney General Barr prepares to vote for Trump, despite calling him 'unfit for office' \u2022 Kansas Reflector\nTOPEKA \u2014 Former U.S. Attorney General Bill Barr said the disappointing nomination of Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden for president of the United States would compel voters to make a decision about which of two unfit candidates would be the lesser evil during the next four years in the White House.\n\nBarr, a conservative Republican who served in the administrations of Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and Trump, said during an appearance Monday at the 100th anniversary of the Kansas Chamber that he would vote for the Republican ticket given the option of two major party nominees he viewed as unfit for office.\n\nHe said he would cast a ballot for former President Trump, who was his boss for nearly two years as attorney general, rather than endorse reelection of President Biden, who defeated Trump in 2020.\n\n\u201cI opposed Trump for the nomination and I spoke out, you know, from the time I left the administration to just about now, hoping that someone else would be the Republican nominee,\u201d Barr said. \u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is that between the two of those candidates, Biden and Trump, I plan to vote Republican.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think either of them are good candidates, and I think I have to vote for the person I think will do the least damage,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump took to Truth Social to express a degree of gratitude to Barr by deleting the word \u201clethargic\u201d from a previous description of him as \u201cweak, slow moving, lethargic, gutless and lazy.\u201d Trump also blasted Barr for not aggressively investigating allegations of widespread voter fraud in the United States. Barr, who resigned as attorney general after Trump\u2019s loss to Biden, said claims that a multistate conspiracy denied him reelection in 2020 were groundless.\n\nWorking class hero\n\nBarr, who also served as attorney general under the first President Bush, spoke to hundreds of people at the Kansas Chamber\u2019s annual gathering in Topeka. In 2023, the organization\u2019s keynote speaker was former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who represented Kansas in the U.S. House before joining the Trump administration.\n\nIn a news conference, Barr declined to say whether a person ordered by a court to pay multimillion-dollar civil judgments and facing dozens of felony charges should be considered a viable candidate for president.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too early to tell exactly how these criminal cases are going to work out. I personally think a lot of them are bogus,\u201d Barr said. \u201cI\u2019ve said I didn\u2019t think he\u2019s fit to be president. I don\u2019t think Biden\u2019s fit to be president. So, it\u2019s a comparison. You have to look at the whole picture of all the pros and cons and given that I think the country will be far worse off after four years of Biden than four years of Trump.\u201d\n\nBarr, who began work with the American Free Enterprise Chamber of Commerce after leaving the federal government, said the appeal and resilience of Trump on the campaign trail was built on frustrations of working-class Americans who felt ignored by the government and gravitated to Trump in 2016, 2020 and would again in 2024.\n\nWhile Barr disputed Trump\u2019s theories about election fraud in 2020, he said attempts by politicians to gain marginal advantages in elections by adjusting laws to tilt the playing field one way or another were counterproductive to rebuilding confidence in the electoral system.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of passion in the system and it\u2019s absolutely critical that people have confidence in the outcome of the election. If we want to avoid the breakdown in the system completely, all Americans should get behind absolute integrity in elections,\u201d he said.\n\nBarr said states should prohibit the gathering of completed ballots \u2014 a process referred to by critics as \u201cballot harvesting\u201d \u2014 for delivery to election offices or ballot boxes. He said mail-in balloting, if allowed, had to be restricted to verified, qualified voters. He said the window for advance voting should be no longer than a few days and certainly not a span that resembled \u201can election season.\u201d\n\nBiden: Buying votes\n\nIn terms of national security, Barr said he couldn\u2019t recall a more dangerous moment in his lifetime as it related to challenges facing the United States. He said expansionist objectives of Russia, Iran and China were intended to displace the United States as a global power. China, in particular, was dedicated to completing a geopolitical shift by seizing Taiwan to the embarrassment of the United States, he said.\n\nIt meant U.S. presidents and members of Congress had to be firmly committed to Taiwan, Ukraine and Israel to avoid the appearance of abandoning allies, Barr said.\n\n\u201cThe United States needs friends in the world,\u201d said Barr, who worked for the CIA early in his government career. \u201cCollective security is important.\u201d\n\nBarr said Biden blundered into a crisis on the border with Mexico by reversing Trump administration policies forbidding undocumented foreign nationals from entering the United States pending evaluation of asylum claims. He said champions of border security shouldn\u2019t be intimidated by allegations they were \u201cracists or hated foreigners\u201d for seeking an orderly and fair system of immigration.\n\nHe said he was puzzled by Biden\u2019s insistence on eliminating without congressional authority repayment of college loan obligations after the U.S. Supreme Court shot down an executive order waiving hundreds of millions of dollars in debts.\n\n\u201cTo me, it was a clear example of trying to buy votes using public assets \u2014 to buy votes in an election year,\u201d Barr said.\n\nBarr faulted higher education administrators for failing to curtail protests on college campuses by critics of Israel\u2019s military campaign in Gaza. The Gaza Health Ministry says airstrikes, street fighting and a six-month siege had led to the death in Gaza of an estimated 33,000 people since Hamas infiltrated Israel to kill more than 1,000 people and take hostages.\n\nHe drew a distinction between protests against the U.S.-led war in Vietnam when he was a student at Columbia University in 1968 and current campus unrest in opposition to fighting by Israel in Gaza. He said protesters in the 1960s had a personal stake because they could be drafted to fight an unpopular war in Southeast Asia. There was no parallel connection for Americans to the battle in Gaza, he said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s taking these cities and college administrators so long to restore order on campus,\u201d Barr said. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the general lawlessness that is gradually overwhelming our system. This has nothing to do with First Amendment rights and expression. You can express your view. You can hold your sign. But this kind of violence, this kind of bullying of everybody else, it has to be met firmly.\u201d",

        "text": "\u2018The US is seen as a joke\u2019: American expats on Trump, Biden and the 2024 election\nSign up for the daily Inside Washington email for exclusive US coverage and analysis sent to your inbox Get our free Inside Washington email Get our free Inside Washington email SIGN UP I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our privacy policy\n\nAn election in which 1 in 6 Americans don\u2019t like either candidate is new territory. And no one finds themselves more called upon to defend their country\u2019s choices than the Americans who currently live abroad.\n\nStudies show there are clear differences in how the US is seen by outsiders when Democrats are in the White House versus when Republicans are. Democrats have held the White House for 11 out of the last 15 years. And for those 11 years, international views of the US were generally quite positive.\n\nJacob Poushter, an associate director at Pew Research Center, tells The Independent that \u201cin surveys that we conducted in 2017 around the world, we did see a precipitous decline in favourable views of the US\u201d following the inauguration of President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cIn particular, confidence in President Trump\u2019s ability to handle international affairs was drastically lower than [President Barack] Obama\u2019s, across virtually all the countries surveyed,\u201d he adds.\n\nBiden insists 'order must prevail' as police shut down college Gaza protests\n\n\u2018Everybody wanted to hear my thoughts on Trump\u2019\n\nHaylee Pearson, 33, experienced this firsthand while living in Madrid, Spain.\n\n\u201cWhen Trump won, everybody wanted to hear my thoughts on Trump: \u2018What do you think about Trump? What do your parents think about Trump? Do you own a gun? Does your parents own a gun?\u2019\u201d she says. As an American expat in western Europe, she experienced a frenzy of questions from interested people throughout Trump\u2019s term.\n\n\u201cAll of these taboo things would be in what seemed like a very trivial question [from] someone who I just met at a party or just met in a work setting,\u201d she says. \u201cTheir genuine curiosity was actually incredibly difficult for me \u2013 [it was hard] to explain all the time because I felt like I had to caveat like, \u2018Oh, I don\u2019t support Trump. I don\u2019t agree with Trump. Please don\u2019t put me in that category of Americans \u2013 in that way of thinking.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe US expats that The Independent spoke to for this article all said they experienced similar sentiments from the residents of the places where they lived. In Canada and western Europe in particular, views of the US reached new highs during the presidency of Barack Obama, and then plummeted during the Trump years, before starting to recover as President Joe Biden came into office.\n\nIn late June 2016, Mr Pouschter and Richard Wike wrote for Pew, regarding Mr Obama: \u201cAround half or more in 15 of 16 countries surveyed, including the United States, have confidence in him to do the right thing regarding world affairs. This includes more than 80 per cent in Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany, France and Australia.\u201d\n\nNearly four years later, in January 2020, Mr Pouschter, Mr Wike, and two additional co-authors noted: \u201cAcross 32 countries surveyed by Pew Research Center, a median of 64 per cent say they do not have confidence in Trump to do the right thing in world affairs, while just 29 per cent express confidence in the American leader.\u201d\n\nIn June last year, across 23 countries, 54 per cent expressed confidence in Mr Biden, while 39 per cent said they did not have confidence in the president, according to the centre.\n\nMs Pearson left the US at the age of 26. After living in Madrid, she moved to London at the end of 2019.\n\n\u201cIn the time between 26 and now, I\u2019ve entered the corporate world, I\u2019ve gotten married, and I\u2019ve had my first child,\u201d she notes, adding that now \u201ceverything just seems more intense and more real\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe made a rule and even joked with my coworkers: no Trump talk, please don\u2019t ask me about Trump. I can\u2019t deal with it anymore,\u201d she adds.\n\nMaggie Fitzsimmons, 31, lives in London now. But she grew up in Arizona, went to college in Texas, and lived in New York City during her young adulthood \u2013 places that cover \u201cquite a broad range\u201d of political viewpoints, she says when speaking to The Independent.\n\nHaving left the US for a job opportunity in 2017, she says she has found that \u201cthere\u2019s this interesting inflexion point that happens when you\u2019ve hit five years abroad. In that, you both start to care less, but then you also realize how much more ridiculous it is [inside the US] at the same time\u201d.\n\n\u2018The whole character of where I was living had changed entirely\u2019\n\nIn 2020, at the age of 60, Alice Engelmore moved to Canada, after having lived in Ireland between 2013 and 2017. She moved during the pandemic, leaving California for Vancouver.\n\n\u201cI just felt that the whole character of where I was living had changed entirely; that people weren\u2019t being kind to each other. It was in the middle of the pandemic, and there was quite a split, even in my neighbourhood in California, where my neighbours were anti-vaxxers. And they were not complying with restrictions \u2026 having parties. And it was just very difficult,\u201d she tells The Independent.\n\n\u201cWhen Obama was elected in 2008, we saw a \u2026 jump in ratings from the lows of the George W Bush administration,\u201d Mr Poushter says, adding that the 2017 \u201cdecline in favorable views of the US was driven a lot by a lack of confidence in Trump and opposition to his signature foreign policy pledges, such as building a wall between the US and Mexico and withdrawing from international climate agreements.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought he\u2019d be indicted before he was elected,\u201d Ms Engelmore says, recalling what it was like in 2016. \u201cI honestly didn\u2019t think he would be elected.\u201d\n\n\u2018Negative aspects of US soft power\u2019\n\nMr Poushter cites an international survey amid the pandemic, which showed that one of the more negative aspects of US soft power was the \u201cUS standard of living.\u201d In particular, \u201cthe health care system got especially poor marks\u201d.\n\nMs Pearson believes \u201cBiden is almost trying to bring America up to the standard of living that Europeans and Brits already understand\u201d.\n\n\u201cI think people think that [the US] operates like a much poorer country than it is,\u201d Ms Fitsimmons says. \u201cI think people view it almost as a country that should be considered almost third-world, but it should be operating at a richer capacity than it is.\u201d\n\nShe adds that locals around her see the Biden-Trump rematch as a bit \u201csatirical\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey think it\u2019s kind of a joke of a country in a lot of ways,\u201d she says. \u201cI think it differs between the people who have spent time in America and know Americans versus those who maybe have watched it through TV. And those who have watched it through TV are probably the ones who think it\u2019s more of a joke, whereas people who have lived there, gone there, understand it a bit more.\u201d\n\nMs Fitsimmons says that when the topic of US politics comes up, locals may recall \u201csnippets of things they\u2019ve heard in the news. Like, \u2018Oh, is the wall still being built?\u2019 Or \u2018Trump, he was arrested, right? Didn\u2019t he have a mug shot?\u2019 \u2013 I think they pick up on little snippets that they\u2019ve seen, rather than engage in like intelligent discourse about it\u201d.\n\n\u2018America is not the greatest country. It never really has been\u2019\n\nMr Poushter says the ratings for Mr Biden \u201crange from country to country. Biden\u2019s very popular in Poland, for example \u2014 83 per cent have confidence in him. But in neighbouring Hungary, only 19 per cent have confidence in Biden. So his ratings are generally positive, but mixed views towards the US are also generally positive in the last year \u2026 due to \u2026 some of the soft power aspects \u2013 American technology, entertainment, universities, and the military are also all seen very strongly\u201d.\n\n\u201cJust to get Trump\u2019s finger off the trigger is a great relief to the world,\u201d Ms Engelmore says. \u201cI think that because he\u2019s still in the wings, he still might become president, there\u2019s still a lot of trepidation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe US is still very much like an episode of Veep, but not in such a dangerous way. Biden is delightfully boring, which is exactly what you would want from someone with so much power,\u201d Ms Pearson adds.\n\nBut much like Americans living through this election cycle in the US, the expats are all disappointed that there\u2019s no younger blood in the wings.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very disappointed with Biden \u2013 he told us that he would be sort of the bridge president into the next generation \u2026 And he did nothing to elevate any younger potential candidates,\u201d Ms Engelmore says. \u201cI think he should have he should have elevated someone else and then back them.\u201d\n\nThe rise of \u201cmiddle-finger politics\u201d may not be unique to the US but it\u2019s possibly more pronounced compared to other western nations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s less polarizing here,\u201d Ms Fitsimmons says of the UK. \u201cI could sit in a room with someone who voted Conservative and someone who voted Labour and they can have a polite conversation. Whereas I feel like in the US, it\u2019s become a lot more polarized, and people of different views can\u2019t have a functional conversation anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cCanada is a much more collectivist country,\u201d Ms Engelmore says. \u201cVancouver came through the pandemic much better than the cities in the states that I was in \u2013 people generally do what their government tells them to do.\u201d\n\nBut she adds that the US has a massive cultural influence in Canada: \u201cWhen I first got here, there were people that were waving Canadian flags off their cars. That is not something I saw before. And the trucker rallies, the gatherings of anti-vaxxers, and conspiracy theorists on corners. All of that feels new, and it feels a little Trumpy.\u201d\n\nMs Pearson says \u201cI think that there\u2019s been a reckoning with a lot of Americans in the past eight years and \u2026 there is this acceptance that America is not the greatest country. It has never really been. There are a lot of things to be proud of about America, but none have happened within the past 10 years.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s America was almost theatrically scary, almost like a bad 80s movie, like he\u2019s an evil politician from a low-budget film. But now that I have a son, everything has changed,\u201d she adds.\n\n\u201cIs this really what we have to offer? Are we really the loudest? Do we really have anything to say?\u201d\n\nHow the US can improve its image\n\nViews of the US rebounded somewhat after Mr Biden came into office, following the close-to-historic lows during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nIn Pew\u2019s 2023 survey of 23 countries, a median of 59 per cent said they had a positive view of the US in 2024.\n\n\u201cI honestly think it probably would be through the figureheads,\u201d Ms Fitsimmons says, when asked how the US can improve its image abroad. \u201cAnd through laws changing. I think people can\u2019t even put their heads around something like gun control not being a thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it does have to do a lot with the person who\u2019s in power, because that\u2019s kind of the way in \u2026 And also people just spending time with Americans in America to know that the people are not the government,\u201d she adds.\n\n\u201cViews towards Trump were a lot lower in the western European countries relative to the eastern European countries, which probably means that, for example, Poland, a country that we\u2019ve surveyed, since \u2026 2005, was actually one of the countries that had relatively positive views of the US during the Bush administration,\u201d Mr Pouschter says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of positive feelings towards the US in eastern Europe, especially in Poland and that\u2019s continued throughout the administrations.\u201d\n\nHe goes on to note that eastern Europeans\u2019 experience during the Cold War and the subsequent NATO expansion to the east has helped keep views of the US mainly positive, regardless of who\u2019s in the White House.\n\n\u201cGermany is a country that swung quite wildly between negative views of Bush, high views of Obama, negative views of Trump, high views of Biden. So I think there is a little more awareness about the American political system in western Europe,\u201d Mr Pouschter says. \u201cThat leads to more changes \u2013 if there\u2019s a change in the presidency\u201d there can be \u201cpretty wild swings in US image and confidence in the US president based on who\u2019s in the presidency\u201d.\n\nMs Engelmore says she hopes the US can rein in social media companies, something which may improve views of the US abroad. With a looming possible ban on TikTok, she may get her wish.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got really mixed feelings about government censorship,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I think the truth is that the kind of misinformation and conspiracy theories that are affecting the US are affecting the rest of the world. If the US could do something to counter that, that would be a huge relief.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think of how careless [Mr Trump] is trying to instigate wars on social media, how reckless he is with the lives of 300 million people and everything just seems scarier now with him being in power and everything seems a little bit more finite,\u201d Ms Pearson adds. \u201cHere he is, with all of his legal issues, with all of his money tied up \u2026 It\u2019s just very scary to see that people continue to support him.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a testament to American culture, but it\u2019s also a testament to how broken the system is,\u201d she adds. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t even be able to get a job working \u2026 as a bank teller, but he can run for public office.\n\n\u201cAmerica will always continue to be a superpower. I don\u2019t see that ending anytime soon. But public opinion, our reputation \u2013 I don\u2019t even think four more years of Biden will fix that.\u201d",

        "text": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. says he has qualified for California\u2019s presidential ballot\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. said Tuesday that he has qualified for California\u2019s presidential election ballot, giving his candidacy a long-shot chance at collecting 54 electoral votes this fall.\n\nIf his spot on the ballot is certified by the California secretary of state, which could happen in August, Kennedy would represent the American Independent Party. The secretary of state\u2019s office confirmed to The Times that Kennedy\u2019s candidacy had been submitted by the party.\n\nThe party has a controversial history dating to 1968, when it nominated Alabama Gov. George Wallace as its candidate for president. He ran opposing desegregation and other federal civil rights laws in championing states\u2019 rights. Kennedy\u2019s father, Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, a Democrat from New York, was assassinated in Los Angeles the night he won that year\u2019s California presidential primary.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKennedy says he has qualified for the ballot in California, Hawaii, Michigan and Utah. He has been investing heavily and, though running as an independent, is seeking alternative paths to the ballot since he opted out of running in the Democratic primary late last year. He recently selected California tech lawyer, entrepreneur and political newcomer Nicole Shanahan as his running mate.\n\nPolitics Times Investigation: Are you an independent voter? You aren\u2019t if you checked this box. With nearly half a million registered members, the American Independent Party is bigger than all of California\u2019s other minor parties combined.\n\nIn a video statement released Tuesday, Kennedy said the American Independent Party was \u201cso impressed by this outpouring of democratic energy and vigor. ... So they approached my campaign and offered us their spot on the California ballot. I see this story as a symbol of America\u2019s homecoming.\u201d\n\nKennedy added that he saw Wallace as a \u201cbigot\u201d who \u201cwas antithetical to everything my father believed in.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn recent years, the AIP has been a source of confusion for voters seeking to avoid registering as either Republican or Democrat.\n\nIn California, voters may register as having no party preference, but The Times reported in 2016 that tens of thousands registered for AIP, many of them in error. Nearly 3 in 4 people did not realize they had joined the party, according to a survey of registered AIP voters conducted for The Times.\n\nThe AIP now exists only in California. Wallace won 46 electoral votes nationally as its standard bearer in 1968, one of the most successful third-party runs in modern history.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAIP today is not segregationist. In recent years, officials told The Times it \u201cis a conservative, constitutionalist party.\u201d It has opposed abortion.\n\nThe 2024 March California primary voter guide said AIP members \u201care all refugees from the Republican or Democrat parties . We believe the Constitution is the contract America has with itself. Its willful distortion led to the violation of our 10th Amendment guaranteed right to limited government \u2014 which inevitably requires oppressive taxation. Its faithful application will lift that burden.\u201d\n\nIn a statement Tuesday, AIP state Chairman Victor Moroni said, \u201cWe all deserve to find inspiration at the ballot box. Our party is pleased to provide the opportunity for all 22 million voters in California to vote for Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for President. Voters crave a real leader who will unite America.\u201d\n\nThe move could have an impact on the presidential race in California, but not enough to change the expected outcome.\n\nA March poll from the UC Berkeley Institute of Government Studies and The Times found PresidentBiden leading former President Trump by 18 percentage points statewide in a head-to-head matchup. That dropped to 12 points when independent and candidates from minor parties were included.\n\nIn battleground states, Kennedy\u2019s ability to qualify for the ballot could prove pivotal. In Michigan, like in California, Kennedy latched onto a smaller party \u2014 the Natural Law Party \u2014 that long held a ballot line. His success in these efforts appears to have led Trump to ratchet up his attacks on the Los Angeles resident. The former president said on social media over the weekend that Kennedy is \u201cfar more LIBERAL than anyone running as a Democrat.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Michigan, recent polls have shown the race essentially tied between Trump and Biden, with Kennedy a distant third. Polls in other battleground states show a tight contest but Trump leading in most cases.\n\nKennedy\u2019s campaign has been on the receiving end of attacks from Democrats, who view him as a spoiler who could result in another term for Trump. They point to his extreme views and disinformation about vaccines.",

        "text": "Who Watches GB News?\nThe launch of GB News in the summer of 2021 was the biggest shake-up of the British TV news media market since the launch of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Sky News in 1989.\n\nThe channel has endured its share of controversies: From the acrimonious exit of its first Chairman, Andrew Neil, just months after it launched; to the sackings of presenters such as Dan Wooton and Laurence Fox; to the Ofcom investigations into potential breaches of impartiality.\n\nBut having weathered these storms, the channel now occupies an important niche in the media landscape in Britain, particularly on the conservative centre-right. It has seen off its better budgeted rival, Talk TV, and in recent filings to companies house revealed it was reaching an average of 2.7 million viewers per month in the year ending May 2023, up 17.8% on the figures from the year before.\n\nSo, who watches GB News?\n\nTo answer this, and other, questions, we at Redfield & Wilton Strategies recently asked a representative sample of 4,000 voters across Great Britain about their media consumption habits.\n\nFor starters, 10% of the total sample name GB News as one of the television news channels that they would typically use for news. That places the channel ahead of international competitors like RT (1%), CNN International (5%), and Al Jazeera (6%), but behind domestic competitors, including Sky (29%), ITV (40%), and the BBC (62%).\n\nWhen drilling deeper into the numbers to see the make-up of GB News viewership, we find that, when broken down by gender, men account for 62% of those who say they typically use the station for news, while women make-up 38% of those who typically watch the channel.\n\nWhen broken down by age, the figures show that 47% of those who say they typically use GB News are aged either 55-64 (21%) or 65+ (26%), while only 9% of those who typically use the channel are aged 18-24.\n\nIn terms of regional variation, 16% of those who say they typically use GB News for news are based in London, 15% in the North West and 14% in the West Midlands.\n\nA further 12% live in the South East of England.\n\nWhen broken down by how they voted in the last General Election, 51% of those who say they typically use GB News for news voted Conservative at the last General Election, while 22% voted for Labour.\n\nA further 12% of those who typically use GB News did not vote in the 2019 General Election.\n\nLooking ahead to the coming General Election, 38% of those who typically use GB News now intend to vote for Reform UK at the next election, making it the most popular party among GB News viewers. 25% of this cohort are likely to vote Conservative at the next election and 17% for Labour.\n\nThe 2016 referendum on EU membership provides another clear indicator of the character of GB News\u2019 viewership.\n\n63% of those who typically use the channel for news voted to Leave in 2016, while 26% voted Remain.\n\nA further 11% did not vote in 2016.\n\nWhen broken down by self-declared social class, 51% of those who name GB News as a channel they typically use for news say they are working class.\n\n41% say they are middle class and an additional 5% say they are upper class. Those figures are in-line with each cohort\u2019s share of the overall population.\n\n58% of those who typically use GB News for news say they own their own home. 33% live in rented accommodation, and 7% live in their family home.\n\nAmong those who typically use GB News and who say they own their own home, 55% had a mortgage which they have paid off, 26% have a mortgage which they are currently paying off, and 19% have never had a mortgage on their home.\n\nOther social barometers provide interesting insights into the nature of GB News viewership.\n\n32% of those who say they typically use GB News enjoy beer as their alcoholic drink of choice, while 27% prefer wine. A further 13% are spirit drinkers.\n\nAmong those who pick beer as their alcoholic drink of choice, 59% name Lager as their beer type of choice, against 33% who pick ale, and 7% stout.\n\nRespondents who say they typically use GB News for news are more likely than members of the overall population to class themselves as football fans.\n\nWhile 33% of the overall population say they are \u2018absolutely\u2019 a football fan, that number rises to 47% among those who typically watch GB News. 27% of Britons say they are \u2018somewhat\u2019 football fans, against 29% of those who typically use GB News.\n\nAnd while 40% of Britons answer \u2018No, not at all\u2019 when asked if they consider themselves a football fan, that number falls to 24% among those who typically watch GB News.\n\nFinally, GB News viewers are far more likely to be fans of Marmite than the overall population.\n\nWhile a majority (53%) of Britons say they do not like marmite, against 38% who say they do, a plurality of those who typically watch GB News (49%) say they are fans of the savoury spread, against 39% of this group who say they are not.\n\nIn summary, our findings are that those most likely to be GB news viewers are men; those aged 55 and older; and living in London or the North-East or West Midlands of England.\n\nThose who voted in Leave in 2016 are also more likely to be GB News viewers, as are those who intend to vote Reform at the next election, although more liberal and left-leaning voters also watch the channel.\n\nGB News viewers tend to also be working class, are more likely to be beer drinkers than non-beer drinks, and are more likely to declare themselves to be football fans than the general population of Britain.",

Or maybe that\u2019s just when many people at the pale brick Catholic church in the quiet Wisconsin neighborhood finally began to realize what was happening.\n\nThe choir director, a fixture at St. Maria Goretti for nearly 40 years, was suddenly gone. Contemporary hymns were replaced by music rooted in medieval Europe.\n\nSo much was changing. Sermons were focusing more on sin and confession. Priests were rarely seen without cassocks. Altar girls, for a time, were banned.\n\nAt the parish elementary school, students began hearing about abortion and hell.\n\n\u201cIt was like a step back in time,\u201d said one former parishioner, still so dazed by the tumultuous changes that began in 2021 with a new pastor that he only spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nIt\u2019s not just St. Maria Goretti.\n\nBrothers Leven Barton, left, Florian Rumpza, center, and Angelus Atkinson, sing in Latin during Catholic Mass at Benedictine College, Dec. 3, 2023, in Atchison, Kan.

Generations of Catholics who embraced the modernizing tide sparked in the 1960s by Vatican II are increasingly giving way to religious conservatives who believe the church has been twisted by change, with the promise of eternal salvation replaced by guitar Masses, parish food pantries and casual indifference to church doctrine.\n\nThe shift, molded by plummeting church attendance, increasingly traditional priests and growing numbers of young Catholics searching for more orthodoxy, has reshaped parishes across the country, leaving them sometimes at odds with Pope Francis and much of the Catholic world.\n\nThe changes are not happening everywhere. There are still plenty of liberal parishes, plenty that see themselves as middle-of-the-road. Despite their growing influence, conservative Catholics remain a minority.\n\nYet the changes they have brought are impossible to miss.\n\nGenerations of U.S. Catholics are giving way to religious conservatives who believe the church has been twisted by change. It has reshaped parishes and universities across the country, leaving them sometimes at odds with much of the Catholic world. (AP Video/ Jessie Wardarski)\n\nThe progressive priests who dominated the U.S. church in the years after Vatican II are now in their 70s and 80s. Many are retired. Some are dead. Younger priests, surveys show, are far more conservative.\n\n\u201cThey say they\u2019re trying to restore what us old guys ruined,\u201d said the Rev. John Forliti, 87, a retired Twin Cities priest who fought for civil rights and reforms in Catholic school sex education.\n\nDoug Koesel, an outspoken 72-year-old priest at Blessed Trinity Parish in Cleveland, was blunter: \u201cThey\u2019re just waiting for us to die.\u201d\n\nAt St. Maria Goretti, once steeped in the ethos of Vatican II, many parishioners saw the changes as a requiem.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want my daughter to be Catholic,\u201d said Christine Hammond, whose family left the parish when the new outlook spilled into the church\u2019s school and her daughter\u2019s classroom. \u201cNot if this is the Roman Catholic Church that is coming.\u201d\n\nBut this is not a simple story. Because there are many who welcome this new, old church.\n\nThey often stand out in the pews, with the men in ties and the women sometimes with the lace head coverings that all but disappeared from American churches more than 50 years ago. Often, at least a couple families will arrive with four, five or even more children, signaling their adherence to the church\u2019s ban on contraception, which most American Catholics have long casually ignored.\n\nThey attend confession regularly and adhere strictly to church teachings. Many yearn for Masses that echo with medieval traditions \u2013 more Latin, more incense more Gregorian chants.\n\n\u201cWe want this ethereal experience that is different from everything else in our lives,\u201d said Ben Rouleau, who until recently led St. Maria Goretti\u2019s young adult group, which saw membership skyrocket even as the parish shrank amid the turmoil.\n\nThey are, Rouleau said, happily out of touch with a liberal city like Madison.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s radical in some ways,\u201d Rouleau said. \u201cWe\u2019re returning to the roots of the church.\u201d\n\nA woman and child kneel during Catholic Mass at Benedictine College, Oct. 29, 2023, in Atchison, Kan.

When the pope\u2019s helicopter landed just outside Mile High Stadium, the ground shook from the stomping.\n\nThe pope, whose grandfatherly appearance belied an electric charisma, and who was beloved both for his kindness and his sternness, confronted an American church shaped by three decades of progressive change.\n\nIf the church is often best known to non-Catholics for its opposition to abortion, it had grown increasingly liberal since Vatican II. Birth control was quietly accepted in many parishes, and confession barely mentioned. Catholic social teaching on poverty suffused churches. Most priests traded in their cassocks for plain black shirts with Roman collars. Incense and Latin became increasingly rare.\n\nOn some issues, John Paul II agreed with these liberal-minded Catholics. He spoke against capital punishment and pushed for workers\u2019 rights. He preached relentlessly about forgiveness \u2013 \u201cthe oxygen that purifies the air of hatred.\u201d He forgave his own would-be assassin.\n\nBut he was also uncompromising on dogma, warning about change and cracking down on liberal theologians. He urged a return to forgotten rituals.\n\nCatholics \u201care in danger of losing their faith,\u201d he told crowds at the final Denver Mass, decrying abortion, drug abuse, and what he called \u201csexual disorders,\u201d a barely veiled reference to growing acceptance of gay rights.\n\nAcross the nation, fervent young Catholics listened.\n\nNewman Centers, which serve Catholic university students, became increasingly popular. So did FOCUS, a traditionalist organization working on American college campuses. Conservative Catholic media grew, particularly the cable TV network EWTN, a prominent voice for increased orthodoxy.\n\nToday, conservative Catholic America has its own constellation of online celebrities aimed at young people. There\u2019s Sister Miriam James, an ever-smiling nun in full habit who talks openly about her hard-partying college days. There\u2019s Jackie Francois Angel, who speaks in shockingly frank detail about sex, marriage and Catholicism. There\u2019s Mike Schmitz, a movie-star handsome Minnesota priest who exudes kindness while insisting on doctrine.\n\nEven today, surveys show most American Catholics are far from orthodox. Most support abortion rights. The vast majority use birth control.\n\nBut increasingly, those Catholics are not in church.\n\nIn 1970, more than half of America\u2019s Catholics said they went to Mass at least once a week. By 2022, that had fallen to 17%, according to CARA, a research center affiliated with Georgetown University. Among millennials, the number is just 9%.\n\nEven as the U.S. Catholic population has jumped to more than 70 million, driven in part by immigration from Latin America, ever-fewer Catholics are involved in the church\u2019s most important rites. Infant baptisms have fallen from 1.2 million in 1965 to 440,000 in 2021, CARA says. Catholic marriages have dropped by well over two-thirds.\n\nThe shrinking numbers mean that those who remain in the church have outsized influence compared with the overall Catholic population.\n\nOn the national level, conservatives increasingly dominate the U.S. Catholic Bishops Conference and the Catholic intellectual world. They include everyone from the philanthropist founder of Domino\u2019s Pizza to six of the nine U.S. Supreme Court justices.\n\nThen there\u2019s the priesthood.\n\nYoung priests driven by liberal politics and progressive theology, so common in the 1960s and 70s, have \u201call but vanished,\u201d said a 2023 report from The Catholic Project at Catholic University, based on a survey of more than 3,500 priests.\n\nToday\u2019s young priests are far more likely to believe that the church changed too much after Vatican II, tangling itself up in America\u2019s rapidly shifting views on everything from women\u2019s roles to LGBTQ people.\n\n\u201cThere really aren\u2019t very many liberals in the seminaries anymore,\u201d said a young, recently ordained Midwestern priest. He spoke on condition of anonymity because of the turmoil that engulfed his parish after he began pressing for more orthodox services. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable.\u201d\n\nStudents leave after attending a Catholic Mass at Benedictine College, Dec. 3, 2023, in Atchison, Kan.

Maybe there\u2019s a little more Latin sprinkled into Mass, or an occasional reminder to go to confession. Maybe guitars are relegated to Saturday evening services, or dropped completely.\n\nAnd sometimes the changes come like a whirlwind, dividing parishes between those thirsting for a more reverent Catholicism and those who feel their spiritual home has been taken from them.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d leave Mass thinking, \u2018Holy cow! What just happened?\u2019\u201d said another ex-parishioner at St. Maria Goretti, whose family eventually left the church, describing the 2021 promotion of a new pastor, and a sudden focus on sin and confession.\n\nLike many former parishioners, he spoke only on condition of anonymity, worried about upsetting friends still at the church. Diocesan clergy did not respond to requests for interviews.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a lifelong Catholic. I grew up going to church every Sunday,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019d never seen anything like this.\u201d\n\nThe new outlook has spilled across America.\n\nIn churches from Minnesota to California, parishioners have protested changes introduced by new conservative priests. In Cincinnati, it came when the new priest abandoned gospel music and African drumming. In small-town North Carolina, it was an intense focus on Latin. In east Texas, it was a right-wing bishop forced out by the Vatican after accusing Pope Francis of undermining church teachings.\n\nEach can seem like one more skirmish in the cultural and political battles tearing at America.\n\nBut the movement, whether called conservative or orthodox or traditionalist or authentic, can be hard to define.\n\nRev.

There\u2019s the recent \u201cCatholic Prayer for Trump,\u201d a $1,000-a-plate dinner at the former president\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort, featuring a string of conspiracy theorists.\n\nYet the orthodox movement can also seem like a tangle of forgiveness and rigidity, where insistence on mercy and kindness mingle with warnings of eternity in hell.\n\nLooming over the American divide is Pope Francis, who has pushed the global church to be more inclusive, even as he toes the line on most dogma.\n\nThe orthodox movement has watched him nervously from the first days of his papacy, angered by his more liberal views on issues like gay relationships and divorce. Some reject him entirely.\n\nAnd the pope clearly worries about America.\n\nThe U.S. church has \u201ca very strong reactionary attitude,\u201d he told a group of Jesuits last year. \u201cBeing backward-looking is useless.\u201d\n\nPope Francis waves to the crowd during a parade, Sept. 26, 2015, in Philadelphia.

It\u2019s in conferences held in California wine country, at reinvigorated parishes in Tennessee and prayer groups in Washington, D.C.\n\nAnd it\u2019s at a little Kansas college built high on a bluff above the Missouri River.\n\nAt first glance, nothing seems unusual about Benedictine College.\n\nStudents worry about unfinished essays and the complexities of dating. They wear cutoff shorts on warm autumn afternoons. Football is huge. The cafeteria food is mediocre.\n\nBut look deeper.\n\nBecause at Benedictine, Catholic teaching on contraception can slip into lessons on Plato, and no one is surprised if you volunteer for 3 a.m. prayers. Pornography, pre-marital sex and sunbathing in swimsuits are forbidden.\n\nIf these rules seem like precepts of a bygone age, that hasn\u2019t stopped students from flocking to Benedictine and other conservative Catholic colleges.\n\nAt a time when U.S. college enrollment is shrinking, Benedictine\u2019s expansion over the last 15 years has included four new residence halls, a new dining hall and an academic center. An immense new library is being built. The roar of construction equipment never seems to stop.\n\nEnrollment, now about 2,200, has doubled in 20 years.\n\nStudents, many of whom grew up in conservative Catholic families, jokingly call it \u201cthe Benedictine bubble.\u201d And it might be a window into the future of the Catholic Church in America.\n\nIn a deeply secular America, where an ever-churning culture provides few absolute answers, Benedictine offers the reassurance of clarity.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t all agree on everything, obviously,\u201d said John Welte, a senior majoring in economics and philosophy. \u201cBut I would say everyone has an understanding of, like, truth.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are certain things you can just know in your mind: This is right, and this is wrong.\u201d\n\nSometimes, people here quietly admit, it goes too far. Like the students who loudly proclaim how often they go to Mass, or the young man who quit his classics course because he refused to read the works of ancient Greek pagans.\n\nVery often, talk here echoes the 13th-century writings of St. Thomas Aquinas, who believed God could be found in truth, goodness and beauty. Sometimes, they say, that means finding God in strict tenets about sexuality. Sometimes in the haunting beauty of Gregorian chants.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a renewal of, like, some really, really good things that we might have lost,\u201d said Madeline Hays, a pensive 22-year-old senior biology major.\n\nBenedictine College students, from left, Madeline Hays, Niki Wood, Ashley Lestone and Hannah Moore gather for evening prayers in a room which they converted to a chapel in the house they share, Dec. 3, 2023, in Atchison, Kan.

The church is a well-kept island of Catholicism tucked into the leafy residential streets of one of America\u2019s most liberal cities.\n\nLike so many other parishes, it had been shaped by the ideals of the 1960s and 1970s. Poverty and social justice became tightly interwoven with sermons and parish life. Gay people felt welcome. Some of the church\u2019s moral absolutes, like the contraception ban, became forgotten dogma.\n\nChange arrived in 2003 with a new bishop, Robert C. Morlino, an outspoken conservative. Many liberals remember him as the man who lambasted the message of acceptance in the modern hymn, \u201cAll Are Welcome.\u201d\n\nHis successor, Bishop Donald J. Hying, steers clear of public battles. But in many ways, he quietly carries on Morlino\u2019s legacy, warning about \u201cthe tangled thinking of Modernism.\u201d\n\nIn 2021, Hying named the Rev. Scott Emerson, a onetime top Morlino aide, as pastor of the Madison church.\n\nParishioners watched - some pleased, some uneasily - as their spiritual home was remodeled.\n\nThere was more incense, more Latin, more talk of sin and confession.\n\nEmerson\u2019s sermons are not all fire-and-brimstone. He speaks often about forgiveness and compassion. But his tone shocked many longtime parishioners.\n\nProtection is needed, he said in a 2023 service, from \u201cthe spiritual corruption of worldly vices.\u201d He has warned against critics \u2013 \u201cthe atheists, journalists, politicians, the fallen-away Catholics\u201d \u2013 he said were undermining the church.\n\nFor some, Emerson\u2019s changes were welcome.\n\nA man prays during Catholic Mass at Benedictine College, Oct. 29, 2023, in Atchison, Kan.

The 6:30 a.m. Friday Mass, Rouleau says, is increasingly popular among young people. But once-packed Sunday Masses now have empty pews. Donations are down. School enrollment plunged.\n\nSome who left have gone to more liberal parishes. Some joined Protestant churches. Some abandoned religion entirely.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a Catholic anymore,\u201d said Hammond, the woman who left when the church\u2019s school began to change. \u201cNot even a little bit.\u201d\n\nBut Emerson insists the Catholic Church\u2019s critics will be proven wrong.\n\n\u201cHow many have laughed at the church, announcing that she was passe, that her days were over and that they would bury her?\u201d he said in a 2021 Mass.\n\n\u201cThe church,\u201d he said, \u201chas buried every one of her undertakers.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press journalist Jessie Wardarski contributed to this report.",
