        "text": "LifeStance Survey Finds 79% of Americans Are Experiencing Anxiety Over the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election\nElection stress is contributing to an increase in anxiety and strained relationships, reinforcing the importance of accessible mental healthcare\n\nSCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Oct. 8, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- A LifeStance Health survey released today reveals how widespread election-related anxiety is impacting Americans' mental health, straining their personal relationships and prompting many to limit social media exposure.\n\nNearly four out of five (79%) respondents said the upcoming U.S. presidential election has caused them anxiety this year. Key generational differences were evident, with younger individuals more likely to experience moderate to significant election-related anxiety. Additionally, nearly two-thirds (60%) of respondents who are currently in therapy say they have discussed politics or the election with their clinician during sessions.\n\nThese findings underscore the ongoing need for high-quality, accessible mental healthcare, as therapy plays a critical role in helping people effectively navigate election-related anxiety, develop healthy coping techniques and maintain their overall mental well-being during times of stress. For tips on how to cope with election-related anxiety, visit LifeStance's blog .\n\nKey findings from LifeStance's survey, \"The 2024 Election Cycle's Impact on Mental Health & Relationships,\" include:\n\nThe U.S. presidential election is a significant source of stress and anxiety for Americans, especially among younger generations.\n\nThe vast majority (79%) of respondents said the upcoming presidential election has caused them some degree of anxiety this year, with 21% saying it has caused them significant anxiety.\n\nYounger generations are the most likely to have experienced \"moderate\" to \"significant\" election-related anxiety, including 64% of Generation Z and 54% of millennials, as compared with 47% of Generation X and 52% of baby boomers.\n\nMore than half (57%) of respondents think about the election daily, including nearly one-third (31%) who said they think about it multiple times per day.\n\nForty-four percent of Gen Z have even postponed major life events such as moving, going to college, getting married or having children due to anxiety about the political climate.\n\nTherapy plays a crucial role in helping people process external stressors like politics. In fact, nearly two-thirds (60%) of respondents who are in therapy say they discuss politics or the election with their mental health clinician during sessions.\n\nPolitical disagreements are meaningfully impacting relationships, causing conflict among friends and family and even ending friendships, all of which can significantly impact one's mental health.\n\nNearly half (44%) of respondents said political or election-related discussions have led to conflicts in their personal lives.\n\nThis is especially true of younger generations: 29% percent of Gen Z and 25% of millennials say that discussing politics leads to conflicts \"always\" or \"often,\" compared to 12% of Gen X and 9% of baby boomers.\n\nNearly a quarter (22%) of respondents said they have considered ending a friendship due to opposing political views, and 18% said they have done so before.\n\nDiffering political views are creating tension in romantic relationships and impacting who people choose to date.\n\nHalf (50%) of Gen Z say \"political compatibility\" is an important factor when considering who they date, compared with 42% of millennials, 31% of Gen X and 29% of baby boomers.\n\nOne-third (33%) of respondents said they would not date someone with opposing political views, while more than a quarter (28%) would consider it a \"deal breaker\" if they found out someone they were currently dating had opposing political views.\n\nNearly a quarter (24%) of Gen Z and (23%) millennials have ended a romantic relationship due to political disagreements at least once, compared to 10% of Gen X and 4% of baby boomers.\n\nTo cope with election anxiety, people are adjusting their social media habits and even blocking friends and family members.\n\nOver one-third (34%) of respondents said they unfollowed or blocked a friend or family member on social media due to their political views, while 22% said they haven't but have considered it.\n\nOver two-thirds (72%) of respondents said social media and news coverage contribute to their anxiety about the election, and more than half (54%) limit their exposure to news and social media to manage election-related stress.\n\nMore than half of Gen Z (52%) and 44% of millennials said social media and news coverage have moderately or significantly contributed to their anxiety about the election, compared to baby boomers (37%) and Gen X (35%).\n\n\"Election-related anxiety is just one example of the mounting mental health challenges people face in today's complex world,\" said Dr. Ujjwal Ramtekkar, Chief Medical Officer, LifeStance. \"Our survey highlights the ongoing need to improve access to high-quality mental health care, which would provide even more people with the tools to effectively manage daily life stressors, build long-term resilience and ultimately foster healthier, more resilient communities.\"\n\nMethodology\n\nOn behalf of LifeStance Health, Researchscape International conducted an online survey of 1,052 U.S. adults aged 18 and older. The survey was fielded from Aug. 7 to 15, 2024. The credibility interval is plus or minus four percentage points for questions answered by all respondents. The data was weighted to the U.S. population by eight demographic questions.\n\nABOUT LIFESTANCE HEALTH\n\nFounded in 2017, LifeStance (NASDAQ: LFST) is reimagining mental health.

Here\u2019s what you need to know to cast your ballot.\n\nJump to how to vote in person\n\n\n\nImportant dates\n\nMark these key dates on your calendar:\n\n\n\nOct. 26, 2024: Deadline to register to vote\n\nDeadline to register to vote Oct. 29, 2024: Deadline to apply for vote by mail\n\nDeadline to apply for vote by mail Nov. 5, 2024: General election. Polls will be open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.\n\nEarly voting also takes place in the weeks before, but exact dates vary by municipality.\n\n\n\nHow to register to vote\n\nThe first step to vote in the general presidential election is to make sure you are registered. If you have never registered before, want to switch political parties, recently became a citizen or if you\u2019ve moved since the last time you voted, even if it\u2019s within the same district, you need to register to vote.\n\nYou can register to vote online, by mail or in person. Learn more here to access the necessary forms, or check with your local election office. You\u2019ll need to provide a driver\u2019s license, state ID or social security number to register, or you may be asked, in certain situations such as if it\u2019s your first time voting, to show documents with your name such as a bank statement or utility bill when you go to vote in-person.\n\nWhen you register to vote, you\u2019ll be asked if you want to enroll in a party or stay unenrolled.\n\nAnyone can register, as long as you are:\n\n\n\n18 years old, or will be 18 by the time of the election (you can pre-register when you\u2019re 16)\n\nA U.S. citizen and resident of Massachusetts\n\nNot currently incarcerated for a felony\n\nIf you\u2019re doing certain things at the Registry of Motor Vehicles or MassHealth, such as applying to renew your driver\u2019s license or applying for MassHealth benefits, you may be automatically registered to vote. But if you\u2019ve moved recently, you still need to re-register.\n\nDeadlines: You must register by Oct. 26 for the general election.\n\nIssues, statewide ballot questions and candidates on your ballot\n\nMassachusetts voters will be casting votes for president, as well as U.S. senator, U.S. representative, governor\u2019s councilor, state senator, state representative, clerk of courts, register of deeds and various other local offices.\n\nPresident\n\nVice President Kamala Harris is the Democratic candidate for president and her running mate is Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. President Joe Biden endorsed Harris after he exited the race in July. Harris previously served as a U.S. senator and the attorney general of California.\n\nIn her acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention, Harris pushed her vision of an \u201copportunity economy\u201d and called for more optimism. \u201cWith this election, our nation has a precious, fleeting opportunity to move past the bitterness, cynicism, and divisive battles of the past. A chance to chart a new way forward \u2014 not as members of any one party or faction, but as Americans,\u201d she said.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is running on the Republican side and his running mate is U.S. Sen. JD Vance, an Ohio politician who emerged on the national stage after writing the bestselling book \u201cHillbilly Elegy.\u201d In his speech accepting the nomination at the Republican National Convention, just under a week after an assassination attempt, Trump said, \u201cUnder our leadership, the United States will be respected again. ... No nation will question our power. No enemy will doubt our might. Our borders will be totally secure. Our economy will soar. We will return law and order to our streets, patriotism to our schools, and importantly, we will restore peace, stability and harmony all throughout the world.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Trump and Harris, Massachusetts voters will see candidates representing four other parties on their ballot: Shiva Ayyadurai, an independent, Jill Stein from the Green-Rainbow Party, Claudia De la Cruz from the Party for Socialism and Liberation, and Libertarian Chase Oliver.\n\n\n\nU.S. Senator\n\nU.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren is running for reelection, and has emphasized the importance of keeping Democratic control. \u201cThe Republican efforts in the House and the Senate to have a nationwide abortion ban will have new life. It means cuts to Medicare and Social Security will be back on the table. And it means that billionaires will get even more tax cuts,\u201d Warren said on GBH\u2019s Boston Public Radio.\n\nJohn Deaton, a former U.S. Marine and cryptocurrency attorney, is running for the Senate seat as a Republican. He has said Warren is more \u201cloyal to the Democratic Party\u201d than her constituents, and that he would be an \u201cindependent voice\u201d in Congress who is willing to break with his party on some issues.\n\nWarren and Deaton will face each other at a GBH News/New England Public Media debate on Oct. 17.\n\n\n\nBallot questions\n\nQuestion 1 has been spearheaded by State Auditor Diana DiZoglio. If passed, it would expand the auditor\u2019s investigative power and allow her office to audit the Massachusetts Legislature.\n\nQuestion 2 concerns the MCAS exam. If passed, this measure would remove the graduation requirement for Massachusetts public school students to pass the 10th grade exam. Students would still take the exam, but schools would use their own graduation criteria. The Massachusetts Teachers Union is pushing the measure, arguing that standardized tests aren\u2019t the best way to measure students\u2019 abilities. Some parents\u2019 groups oppose the measure, saying that it helps ensure that high standards are met by all students.\n\nQuestion 3 would allow rideshare drivers at companies like Uber and Lyft to form unions and push for better wages and working conditions. Several unions like Local 32BJ are supporters of the measure. Some opponents say it could increase the cost of rides. This measure would not apply to other gig workers like DoorDash and InstaCart.\n\nQuestion 4 would legalize some natural psychedelics, like psilocybin. It would allow people to grow them at home, and create ways for adults to take them under professional supervision. Advocates say psychedelics help with conditions like depression and PTSD. Opponents say the way the measure is written doesn\u2019t provide enough specific standards for the treatment facilities or home cultivation, and it could be very expensive for people who want to use the products.\n\nQuestion 5 would increase the base pay for tipped workers in Massachusetts, implemented gradually over five years until their wage reaches the state\u2019s minimum wage. Customers would still be able to leave tips. Proponents say a higher tipped wage would help tipped workers like servers have more stable incomes, and potentially equalize pay between \u201cfront of house\u201d and \u201cback of house\u201d workers. Opponents include tipped workers who worry they would receive fewer tips and less pay overall. Some restaurants say that menu prices may go up to compensate for the higher wages, or they may have lower profits.\n\nCities and towns may have their own ballot questions, too. You can preview your ballot here.\n\n\n\nYour options for voting\n\nOnce you\u2019ve registered and done your research on the issues and candidates, it\u2019s time to vote.\n\nAbsentee voting and vote by mail\n\nIf you won\u2019t be home on Election Day, are serving in the military or living overseas, are currently incarcerated, or you have religious beliefs or a disability that prevent you from voting in person at your polling place, you may be eligible to vote with an absentee ballot. You can apply by mail, email or fax through your local election office. You\u2019d be using the same ballots as voters who vote by mail and need to meet the same deadlines.\n\nAll other voters are entitled to vote by mail for any reason, as long as you\u2019re already registered to vote. Every Massachusetts resident should be sent an application in the mail before the election. You can also apply online.\n\nDeadlines: You must apply to vote absentee or by mail no later than Oct. 29.\n\nOfficials urge voters to apply as early as they can to allow enough time for the mail to arrive. While you\u2019re waiting, you can use the online ballot tracker to follow the status of your ballot.\n\nYou can also choose to return your mail-in ballots in person at your city or town\u2019s local election office or ballot drop boxes \u2014 but not your polling location on Election Day. View Boston\u2019s locations around the city.\n\n\n\nEarly voting\n\nIf you prefer to vote in person, you can get a head start and vote early, no reason needed. You don\u2019t need to vote at your designated polling location, unlike on Election Day.\n\nIn Boston, early voting will take place from Saturday, Oct. 19, through Friday, Nov. 1. Here\u2019s a map of early polling sites and drop boxes.\n\nYou can also find information about early voting locations and hours in Brookline, Cambridge, Chelsea, Somerville, Springfield and Worcester.\n\nLive in another city? Check out the secretary of state\u2019s website for a searchable list.\n\n\n\nVote in person on Election Day\n\nYou can always vote in person on Election Day, Nov. 5. Polls will be open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Find your polling location here and view your ballot.\n\nIn most cases, you will not be asked to show an ID to vote. There are only some cases, like if you\u2019re voting for the first time, that a poll worker may ask to see your ID. Your proof of identification can be a license, recent utility bill or a copy of your rental lease.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have your ID with you, it\u2019s your right to request a provisional ballot. You can then return to the polling location before it closes to have your ID verified and your vote counted.\n\nYou can also cast a provisional ballot if your name isn\u2019t on the list at your polling location. You can ask the poll worker to call the local election office to confirm your registration.\n\n\n\nHow to vote if you\u2019re a college student\n\nIf you\u2019re a college student in Massachusetts, you have a choice on where you vote: at your permanent address in your home state, or at your student address, whether it\u2019s an off-campus address or a dorm. Registering to vote on your campus address does not impact your financial aid or your parents\u2019 tax dependent status. Just remember you can only be registered at one address, and you need to re-register every time you change addresses.\n\nIf you do want to vote at your college address, follow all of the above steps to register before Election Day.\n\nIf you want to vote at your permanent address, you probably have to vote absentee, so check with your home election office and make sure you apply for a ballot early.\n\nMany colleges in the state, including UMass, provide resources and host registration drives to help students get involved in the democratic process in the leadup to an election, so check with your school.\n\nHow to vote if you have a disability\n\nMassachusetts requires that all polling locations are physically accessible, which should include accessible parking and entrances. Poll workers should be trained to assist voters with disabilities. Every location should have an AutoMARK voting machine for voters to cast their ballot independently. You also have the right to bring someone with you to help in any part of voting.\n\nVoters with disabilities are entitled to request an accessible ballot when you fill out the application to vote by mail. Voters with disabilities also now have the option to submit their ballot electronically.",

        "text": "7 \u2018October Surprises\u2019 That Disrupted US Presidential Elections\nPresidential candidates have always understood that in a close election, any big news story in the last weeks of a campaign could be enough to tip the contest in November. Now known as an \u201cOctober surprise,\u201d the news story might take the form of a scandalous revelation about a candidate, the outbreak of war or economic turmoil, or even a fake story planted by a political enemy.\n\nAs early as the 1840 election, New York Democrats in support of President Martin Van Buren waited until mid-October to accuse the Whig party of paying Pennsylvanians to vote in New York, a key swing state. A whig official even admitted to the scheme, but it wasn\u2019t the bombshell scandal Democrats had hoped for. Van Buren still lost New York and the election.\n\nAmerica 101: What is a Swing State?\n\n\u201cWhat the idea of the \u2018October surprise\u2019 suggests, above all, is that the proximity to the election is when big news can move the needle,\u201d says David Greenberg, a political historian and journalist at Rutgers University. \u201cThe truth is, voters make up their minds based on a mixture of impressions, personalities, partisan loyalties, ideological leanings, as well as news and issues. It's never easy to say precisely that this one thing made the difference.\u201d\n\nBelow are seven examples of memorable (or anticipated) \u201cOctober surprises\u201d in U.S. presidential history.\n\n1. A Forged Letter Almost Becomes Garfield\u2019s \u2018Death Warrant\u2019 (1880)\n\nGetty Images / Pictures from History / Contributor White House portrait of James A. Garfield\n\nChinese immigration was a hot-button issue in the 1870s. In just a decade, more than 120,000 Chinese men and boys came to the United States under contract to work the railroads. Western states in particular were anxious about the influx of foreign labor and Democrats called for an immediate moratorium on Chinese immigration.\n\nRepublican candidate James Garfield took a more measured position, calling for new negotiations with China and for Congress to consider reasonable limitations on Chinese immigration that, \u201cwithout violence or injustice, will place upon a sure foundation the peace of our communities and the freedom and dignity of labor.\u201d\n\nBut just 12 days before the 1880 election, a letter emerged. Allegedly written by Garfield on House of Representatives stationary, the Republican candidate told a Massachusetts businessman named H.L. Morey that \u201cindividuals and companies have the right to buy labor where they can get it cheapest.\u201d In other words, unrestricted Chinese immigration is good for business.\n\nDemocrats printed half a million copies of the \u201cMorey letter\u201d and distributed them in tightly contested states like California. They called it Garfield\u2019s \u201cdeath warrant.\u201d\n\nRepublicans were slow to respond, but sent a team of private investigators to track down the letter\u2019s recipient in Massachusetts. There was no H.L. Morey. Garfield declared the letter a forgery and published his handwriting side-by-side with the letter to prove it was a fake.\n\nThe forged letter did real damage, though, costing Garfield California. Although Garfield eventually won the election 214 electoral votes to 155, he barely won the popular vote by .02 percentage points.\n\n2. FDR Almost Loses the Black Vote (1940)\n\nThe 1936 election signaled a landmark shift for Black voters. Prior to 1936, Black voters were loyal Republicans, the party of Lincoln. But as more African Americans moved out of the South to northern cities, they joined other racial and ethnic minorities fighting for better jobs and working conditions. After the Great Depression struck, Black voters flocked to Democratic Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal programs.\n\nFDR carried 71 percent of the Black vote in 1936 and he hoped to do the same in 1940, but public opinion had changed. As America prepared for entry into World War II, Black Americans were appalled that segregation was still the norm in the U.S. military, and that FDR had done nothing about it. Meanwhile, FDR\u2019s Republican opponent, Wendell Wilkie, was a vocal champion of civil rights.\n\nOn October 28, a high-profile incident threatened to cost FDR the Black vote for good. The president was campaigning in New York City at an event in Madison Square Garden. As FDR left for the train station, one of his staffers\u2014a short-tempered press aide named Stephen Early\u2014was blocked by two police officers. In a violent outburst, Early kneed one of the cops in the crotch. The officer, James Sloan, was Black.\n\nAs Sloan was rushed to the hospital, Early\u2014the descendent of a Confederate general\u2014issued a half-hearted apology. \u201cA policeman appears to have been hurt,\u201d Early told the press. \u201cI did not attack or kick any officer. But since one officer believes I was responsible for hurting him, I wish to apologize\u2026 I cannot understand why Republican politicians are attempting to find political significance in this incident.\u201d\n\nTwo days before the election, FDR tried to salvage the situation by announcing the creation of the Tuskegee Airmen and promoting Colonel Benjamin O. Davis Jr. to brigadier general, the first Black officer to reach that rank.\n\nFDR ended up winning an unprecedented third term as president and only lost a small percentage of the Black vote.\n\n3. Reagan Campaign Coins the Term \u2018October Surprise\u2019 (1980)\n\nIran Hostage Crisis\n\nInterestingly, the term \u201cOctober surprise\u201d was coined during an election where there wasn\u2019t an actual October surprise.\n\nIn 1980, the Iranian Hostage Crisis cast a shadow over the presidential election. More than 50 American citizens were held hostage at the American Embassy in Tehran with no political solution in sight. Election Day would mark a full year of their captivity.\n\nRonald Reagan campaigned on a promise to free the hostages, something that President Jimmy Carter\u2019s administration had failed to do. But inside the Reagan campaign, there was mounting suspicion that Carter had actually secured the hostages\u2019 release, but was waiting to announce it during the final weeks of the campaign.\n\nIt was William Casey, Reagan\u2019s campaign manager, who dubbed Carter\u2019s alleged scheme an \u201cOctober surprise.\u201d\n\nTime magazine reported, \u201c[Reagan\u2019s campaign] expects [Carter] to pull what they call \u2018the October surprise,\u2019 meaning that shortly before Election Day, he will inflate the importance of some overseas event in an attempt to rally the country around him.\u201d\n\nThat didn\u2019t happen, of course. Election Day came and went, the hostages remained in Tehran and Reagan won handily. The real surprise came on January 20, when Iran released the hostages just hours after Reagan's inauguration. Democrats then accused Reagan of striking a secret deal with Iran to hold the hostages until after he took office.\n\n4. Kissinger Prematurely Announces \u2018Peace\u2019 in Vietnam (1972)\n\nHenry Kissinger holds a press conference Oct. 26, 1972. Credit: Getty Images U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger holds a press conference Oct. 26, 1972 at which he says that agreement on a cease-fire in Vietnam is near.\n\nThe Vietnam War was the major political issue of both the 1968 and 1972 elections. Even though the term \u201cOctober surprise\u201d hadn\u2019t been coined yet, the idea was very much a political phenomenon. In both 1968 and 1972, incumbent presidents tried to secure last-minute peace deals to swing the election in their favor.\n\nIn 1968, President Lyndon Johnson chose not to run for reelection, but he was committed to helping his Democratic vice president, Hubert Humphrey, defeat the Republican candidate, Richard Nixon. On October 31, 1968, LBJ ordered a halt to all U.S. bombing campaigns in Vietnam, announcing \u201ca major step toward a firm and an honorable peace in Southeast Asia.\u201d\n\nBut just days later, the peace talks in Vietnam fell apart and Humphrey lost to Nixon. Democrats alleged that Nixon secretly scuttled the talks by promising the South Vietnamese stronger support if he were elected president. (Casey, who later coined \u201cOctober surprise,\u201d was a Nixon aide in 1968.)\n\nFour years later, the Vietnam War was still raging and Nixon was adamant about securing peace before Election Day 1972. In early October, there appeared to be a breakthrough in the peace talks with the North Vietnamese accepting America\u2019s terms for an end to the conflict. Behind the scenes, though, the South Vietnamese strongly objected to the arrangement.\n\nThat didn\u2019t stop Henry Kissinger, Nixon\u2019s national security advisor, from attending a press conference on October 26 and proclaiming that \u201cpeace is at hand.\u201d In reality, the war would continue for another three years.\n\n\u201cIt was big news,\u201d says Greenberg. \u201cToday we would definitely call it an \u2018October surprise,\u2019 even though they weren't using that phrase back then.\u201d\n\nNixon was already heavily favored to win in 1972, but Kissinger\u2019s premature \u201cpeace\u201d announcement may have contributed to his landslide victory.\n\n5. Iran-Contra Indictment Is Bad News for George H.W. Bush (1992)\n\nIn 1992, President George H.W. Bush was fighting to hold onto the White House, but he faced some serious challenges. For starters, the U.S. economy was mired in a recession, never a good place for the incumbent. On top of that, the 1992 race saw the first serious third-party challenge in decades. Billionaire Ross Perot was running as a fiscal conservative and siphoning Republican voters away from Bush.\n\nIf Bush had hopes of defeating his Democratic challenger, Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, they took a serious hit in June 1992. That\u2019s when Caspar Weinberger, who served as Secretary of Defense under President Reagan, was indicted for his involvement in the Iran-Contra Affair.\n\nIran-Contra Affair\n\nWhat\u2019s the connection with Bush? Bush was Reagan\u2019s vice president and had been trying to distance himself from the scandal, in which Reagan allegedly authorized illegal weapons sales to Iran in order to funnel money to the Contras, an anti-socialist army in Nicaragua.\n\nWeinberger was the biggest name to be charged in the case, giving credence to the idea that everyone in the Reagan administration knew about the crime, including Bush. While Weinberger\u2019s indictment didn\u2019t happen in October, the timing was still bad for Bush, who lost the election to Clinton.\n\nGreenberg says that the bad economy and the failure of Reaganomics were the biggest factor in Bush\u2019s loss, but admits that \u201cyou never quite know what goes on in the mind of individual voters as they make their decisions close to Election Day.\u201d\n\nBush pardoned Weinberger before he left office.\n\n6. A DUI Almost Derails George W. Bush (2000)\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the 2000 presidential election, polls showed that the race was a dead heat between George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore. That\u2019s exactly the type of election that could be decided by an \u201cOctober surprise.\u201d\n\nJust days before Election Day\u201a Fox News broke a bombshell story. In 1976, George W. Bush was arrested for drunk driving in Maine after a long night of partying. The revelation seemed to confirm unflattering portrayals of the younger Bush as unfit for office.\n\n\u201cI'm not proud of that,\u201d Bush told the press in a statement. \u201cI made some mistakes. I occasionally drank too much, and I did that night. I learned my lesson.\u201d\n\nThe news story was a last-minute gift to Gore, who won the popular vote in 2000, but famously lost the election after a recount in Florida was halted by the Supreme Court.\n\nRepublican strategist Karl Rove argued that Bush\u2019s \u201cOctober surprise\u201d cost him five states in the 2000 election, enough to have avoided the Florida recount altogether.\n\n7. FBI Reopens Probe into Clinton\u2019s Emails (2016)\n\nThe 2016 election was chock-full of wild \u201cOctober surprises.\u201d On October 7, the Washington Post released a 2005 video of Republican candidate Donald Trump bragging about sexually assaulting women. That same day, Wikileaks released transcripts of Hillary Clinton\u2019s speeches to Wall Street donors, which painted the Democratic candidate as pro-corporate. Then The New York Times reported that Trump hadn\u2019t paid federal taxes in 18 years.\n\nBut all of those bombshell news items paled in comparison to what happened on October 28, just 11 days before the election. James Comey, the FBI director, called a press conference to announce that the intelligence agency was reopening its investigation into Clinton\u2019s private email server\u2014an investigation that the FBI had officially closed in July.\n\nThe resurrection of the email investigation\u2014which had been the target of Republican ire for a year\u2014delivered a crippling blow to the Clinton campaign. (In her memoir, Clinton said that Comey had \u201cshivved\u201d her.) Clinton lost the election by a narrow margin, despite winning the popular vote.\n\n\u201cThere's been a lot of political science research about what they call \u2018recency.\u2019 That is to say, a big scandal in July probably is not going to matter that much, at least to most people, unless it completely derails a candidate,\" says Greenberg. \"But the same scandal a week or two before the election, it sticks.\u201d",

(A new NPR/PBS News/Marist poll indicates the trend is likely to continue in the 2024 general election.)\n\nAn analysis of the 2020 election by the MIT Election Data and Science Lab concluded that the differences in how quickly counties reported their results were \u201cdriven by the fact that smaller and more rural counties, which favored Trump, could report their ballots before the counties with hundreds of precincts and hundreds of thousands of voters.\u201d\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIt took longer for many of those larger counties to report results because of the big batches of mail-in ballots they received, the analysis found. In some states, allowing absentee ballots that arrive after Election Day to be counted also slowed down counting.\n\nAnd there\u2019s another wonky factor to consider \u2014 whether a state\u2019s laws allow election officials to process mail-in ballots before Election Day.\n\n\n\nSome state election laws slow the counting of mail-in ballots\n\nThere\u2019s an in-the-weeds process in election administration that\u2019s called \u201cpre-canvassing.\u201d\n\nIt involves all of the steps needed to prepare mail-in ballots for scanning, including checking voters\u2019 signatures on return envelopes, opening those envelopes and flattening the ballots inside.\n\nWhen this processing is allowed to start varies depending on the state, and the MIT analysis found that states with laws that allow pre-canvassing before Election Day were faster to report results in 2020.\n\nFor this year\u2019s presidential election, the states that do not allow processing before Election Day include two key swing states: Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nWhile Arizona allows processing as soon as a completed ballot is received, election officials in that swing state say there are likely to be reporting delays because hundreds of thousands of voters are not expected to drop off their mail ballots until Election Day.\n\nStill, some election watchers say the experience election officials have gained with mail-in ballots since the 2020 election, and some 2020 mail-in voters returning to in-person voting, could help reduce the time needed to finish counting this year.\n\nBut especially if the presidential race turns out to be close in any states, extra patience may be needed before voters see the true colors of the 2024 electoral map.\n\nEdited by Benjamin Swasey",

        "text": "October 7, 2024, presidential campaign news\nAfter rushing to comfort Israel as it grieved the worst attack on Jews since the Holocaust, President Joe Biden last year pledged America would stand with the country in its dark days and the good ones he insisted would come.\n\nAt the time, no one knew the international and domestic political consequences of his promise. An ensuing war has proved the existential role the US plays in Israel\u2019s survival but also severely strained the alliance. It has also exposed and widened some of America\u2019s most profound political divides ahead of an already tumultuous election between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump next month.\n\nThe October 7, 2023, Hamas terror attacks, which killed 1,200 people, did not just transform the Middle East\u2019s strategic balance as Israel confronted Hamas, then Hezbollah, and traded fire with their sponsor, its archenemy, Iran. Like the September 11 attacks in 2001, the Hamas horror set off a chain of events that affected countless lives, unleashing political disturbances thousands of miles away.\n\nMilitarily, the United States and its allies have twice staged unprecedented operations to protect Israel from a barrage of missiles and drones from Iran. The US has also repeatedly bombed Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen who have launched attacks on international shipping in the Red Sea in the wake of October 7. Amid fears in Washington of a full-on Middle East war, the vulnerability of US troops in the region was tragically driven home in January when three US service personnel were killed in an attack on a base in Jordan.\n\nAt home, the fallout of the Hamas attacks has coincided with the toxic politics of a presidential election year. Campus protests underscored the splits in the Democratic Party, which soon saw unprecedented political upheaval with Biden abandoning his reelection bid and backing Harris just months before the election. In the new race between Harris and Trump, events in the Middle East continue to set off reverberations that could influence the outcome of the election. A horrifying wave of antisemitism, meanwhile, has left many Jews wondering whether they are safe in America.\n\nRead Collinson\u2019s full analysis on how the attacks have shaped US politics.",

        "text": "What U.S. Elections Could Mean for Africa\nPresidential elections in the United States are consequential to every region of the world. Historically, however, they have mattered less in Africa, on which a bipartisan policy consensus in Washington has largely prevailed. Washington\u2019s fundamental approach to the continent has not varied substantially from one administration to the next. Indeed, since the Clinton administration, the U.S. approach to Africa has followed a similar formula involving signature development programs, aspirational talk around democracy and human rights, and ever-expanding security partnerships that have kept ties to the continent on a steady trajectory, but not much more.\n\nHowever, amid a succession of global and U.S. shocks, from the Covid-19 pandemic and the wars in Ukraine and Gaza to the George Floyd protests and the January 6 insurrection, Africa sees the United States through starkly different eyes today. Meanwhile, deep and growing political polarization in the United States is undermining even traditional areas of bipartisan agreement, such as Africa policy. As a result, the conduct and outcome of November\u2019s elections will no doubt shape how Washington is viewed and could well influence a host of policy questions that not only matter materially to Africa, but will affect U.S. credibility on the continent for years to come.\n\nAmid a succession of global and U.S. shocks, from the Covid-19 pandemic and the wars in Ukraine and Gaza to the George Floyd protests and the January 6 insurrection, Africa sees the United States through starkly different eyes today.\n\nAfrica\u2019s Expectations\n\nAfricans are decidedly more sanguine today about what any new U.S. administration will mean for them. Not since Barack Obama was first elected president have Africans believed that whoever was in the White House would materially affect their well-being. However, the notion that a U.S. president with African roots would somehow fundamentally elevate the continent\u2019s importance in Washington was quickly dispelled by an Obama administration that did not stray far from traditional orthodoxy toward Africa: braying about democracy and human rights while also pursuing national security interests that often ran contrary to its stated values. The U.S.-led overthrow of Libyan leader Muammar el-Qaddafi in 2011, the pernicious effects of which are still reverberating across the continent today, remains a contemporary reminder of the ongoing gap between the promotion of U.S. values and the aggressive pursuit of Washington\u2019s fundamental interests in Africa.\n\nDespite promises from the Biden administration to elevate the collective voices of Africans in global decisionmaking and institutions, the White House has continued to fall short of its rhetoric. Africans still hold no seat at the UN Security Council two years after Biden first agreed to it, while the U.S.-led response to climate change, development finance, and great power competition all seem to continue to favor the Global North. This overpromising and underdelivering has only further reinforced the well-established reputation that Washington is an inherently unreliable, even hypocritical, partner. Neither Donald Trump nor Kamala Harris, who have ignored Africa over the course of their campaigns, have done anything to give Africans the impression that their administrations would be appreciably different from the past.\n\nDespite promises from the Biden administration to elevate the collective voices of Africans in global decisionmaking and institutions, the White House has continued to fall short of its rhetoric.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Africans have actively diversified their political, economic, and security partnerships away from Washington over the past decade, sometimes running counter to U.S. interests. China is currently Africa\u2019s largest trade and investment partner, and countries such as Russia, Turkey, and United Arab Emirates are increasingly becoming the security partners of choice to African countries looking for no-strings-attached military assistance. This hedge against U.S. unreliability not only makes the outcome of any single presidential election less consequential to the continent, but also makes it more difficult for any incoming administration to deepen ties with Africa.\n\nForm over Function\n\nThe prospect that there will be deep policy differences between a Trump or Harris administration suggests that each side has deeply held views about what U.S. relationships or policies regarding Africa should look like. But that is simply not the case. From a macro perspective, Africa should expect a great deal of continuity in Washington\u2019s underlying policy approach, featuring a few key development and humanitarian initiatives but nothing that fundamentally challenges the ongoing U.S. modus operandi or how it ranks Africa within its global list of priorities. Interestingly, the prospect of a second U.S. president with African roots also does not appear to have tantalized African publics the way Obama\u2019s campaign did, as most of them have now learned to not expect too much from any U.S. politician.\n\nThe prospect that there will be deep policy differences between a Trump or Harris administration suggests that each side has deeply held views about what U.S. relationships or policies regarding Africa should look like. But that is simply not the case.\n\nHowever, a Harris administration would likely stay faithful to Biden\u2019s U.S. Strategy Toward Sub-Saharan Africa, released in 2022, which seeks to elevate Africa\u2019s voice in global institutions and in U.S. decisionmaking on policy matters that affect the continent directly. Harris herself saw this up close when she traveled to Ghana, Tanzania, and Zambia in March 2023 to \u201chighlight and advance the extraordinary creativity, ingenuity, and dynamism on the continent.\u201d But she has also fallen into the easy trap of trying to frame Africa\u2019s continuing challenges as somehow China\u2019s fault, while painting U.S. engagement as entirely benevolent by making a key feature of her Africa program China\u2019s responsibility for Africa\u2019s debt crisis. Neither are quite true, but holding tight to these tropes does little to show an approach to the continent that breaks from past narratives about how the United States sees African states or how African states should see the United States.\n\nMeanwhile, the Trump shadow policy doctrine, Project 2025, seemingly lifts entire elements of Biden\u2019s same Africa strategy, arguing, for example, that Africa\u2019s \u201cexplosive population growth, large reserves of industry-dependent minerals, proximity to key maritime shipping routes, and its collective diplomatic power ensure the continent\u2019s global importance.\u201d This suggests that the Trump team at least recognizes Africa\u2019s long-term strategic importance, much as Biden did. The question is: What will they do about it?\n\nMore importantly, the Trump team has perhaps now learned to frame Africa\u2019s position as an inherent strength and not merely as a smaller component of the United States\u2019 larger geopolitical struggle with China or Russia, as it did during his first term in office to the chagrin of many on the continent. The bigger litmus test for a potential second Trump administration will be whether he can continue to articulate Africa\u2019s inherent value to U.S. strategic interests or if he will revert back to the kinds of insensitive tropes that defined his first term in office.\n\nIndeed, the biggest overall difference may be one of form over function. Trump\u2019s decidedly derogatory tone during his first term still causes Africans to bristle, but some now view this in retrospect as a harsh yet honest assessment of where they stand in the hierarchy of Washington\u2019s priorities. As difficult as this truth is, having it openly stated sets clear expectations for what African leaders can anticipate from Washington and puts the onus on them to deliver for their own people, something that they are already doing as they seek new security and financial partnerships.\n\nSimilarly, as distasteful as it seems to many in Washington\u2019s foreign policy establishment, Trump\u2019s blatantly transactional approach to policymaking comes off to some African leaders as a more direct and transparent way of doing business\u2014and mirrors how many of them already pursue relations with their partners. In contrast to a policy relationship where both sides do not explicitly benefit, which looks more like charity, this approach can more closely resemble a meeting of equals, which is precisely what many African leaders say they seek in their relations with the world. China goes so far as to call its own strategic agenda with Africa \u201cA Partnership of Equals.\u201d It would therefore be unsurprising to see a Trump approach to Africa with echoes of China\u2019s own tactics toward the continent.\n\nConversely, Washington\u2019s continued pursuit of its hard interests often only thinly disguised under the veil of \u201cshared values\u201d can ring increasingly hollow on a continent where leaders take full note of what they see as U.S. hypocrisy when our values are not universally applied around the globe. An incoming administration will have to reckon with the fact that the overall tenor of U.S. relations with Africa will be shaped in large part by Washington\u2019s unquestioning support of Israel and Africa\u2019s own increasing sympathy for the Palestinian cause, as well as Washington\u2019s ongoing support of Ukraine in its war with Russia, the immediate side effects of which continue to punish Africans in the form of higher commodity prices.\n\nWaning Bipartisanship and Global Policy Differences\n\nExpected policy changes toward Africa are likely to be defined more by their delivery than their fundamental intent. Indeed, many of the approaches that will affect Africa the most, from trade to climate to social policies, are not Africa-specific but will affect the continent quite differently than other parts of the world. The fact that so much of U.S. relations with Africa continues to be determined by the unintended consequences of higher-priority efforts elsewhere in the world defines the challenges and pitfalls policymakers face. Therefore, having approaches that are specifically tailored to Africa\u2019s needs and sensibilities will be critical for any administration seeking to deepen partnerships.\n\nThe fact that so much of U.S. relations with Africa continues to be determined by the unintended consequences of higher-priority efforts elsewhere in the world defines the challenges and pitfalls policymakers face.\n\nTrade\n\nThe next administration will first have to renew the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), the Clinton-era trade platform that remains a cornerstone of U.S. Africa policy and which expires at the end of fiscal year 2025. The act\u2019s inherent strength stems from the fact that it emerged as a direct answer to African leaders\u2019 long-repeated demand for a relationship with Washington based on \u201ctrade, not aid.\u201d But while it remains a defining program of the U.S. relationship with Africa, its promise remains unfulfilled and uneven. Only 32 of Africa\u2019s 54 countries currently qualify for duty-free access to the U.S. market under AGOA, while more than 80 percent of AGOA benefits accrue to only 5 countries.\n\nExpanding AGOA\u2019s reach and impact should be central to its renewal, but this will require a break from recent precedent in which the Biden administration stripped more countries (seven) of their AGOA eligibility than it restored (two), the most suspensions by any president. Fears exist that a potential Harris administration might push seemingly onerous environmental, social, and governance (ESG) requirements that could further hinder AGOA, which would be equally able to punish as to reward when African states fail to meet Washington\u2019s high standards and reinforce the reputation of the United States being a fair-weather friend to Africa. Similarly, Republican threats to suspend the participation of South Africa, AGOA\u2019s largest beneficiary, owing to Pretoria\u2019s \u201coutrageous anti-Americanism,\u201d also risks further fanning African accusations that the United States is an unreliable partner. For this reason, either administration would do well to insulate this trade privilege from the kinds of political machinations at home that routinely undermine U.S. interests abroad.\n\nUkraine\n\nAfrica has suffered undue burdens from not only the war in Ukraine itself, but also the Washington-led response to it. Higher inflation, as well as sanctions prohibiting trade with Russia in essential commodities such as fertilizer and wheat, has hurt African economies. And the \u201cus versus them\u201d narrative Washington has created within the United Nations has alienated African partners and strengthened U.S. adversaries\u2019 ties on the continent. In particular, Russia has been adept at convincing many Africans that it was U.S. adventurism and aggressive action that provoked Moscow\u2019s invasion.\n\nAs such, explicit efforts to end the war in Ukraine and reestablish price stability in the global economy will be met with resounding applause in Africa. Trump has repeatedly pledged a quick end to the war in Ukraine, and his party platform boldly asserts, \u201cWar breeds Inflation while geopolitical stability brings price stability. Republicans will end the global chaos and restore Peace through Strength, reducing geopolitical risks and lowering commodity prices.\u201d Conversely, a Harris administration might double down on bleeding Russia in Ukraine without taking more explicit steps to insulate Africa from the war\u2019s unintended effects; this could foster greater resentment from African states and provide new opportunities for Russia to undermine American interests on the continent.\n\nMilitary Cooperation\n\nIn 2017, Islamist militants ambushed four U.S. Army Green Berets in Tongo Tongo, Niger, throwing into sharp relief the small but significant footprint of U.S. troops spread across the African continent. Responding to the incident, President Trump asked \u201cWhat interest did we have in putting U.S. soldiers in harm\u2019s way in fights in Africa that were not ours?\u201d by ordering a \u201cblank slate\u201d review of U.S. forces in Africa that could have resulted in the complete withdrawal of troops from the continent, which it almost fully achieved in Somalia. However, Trump\u2019s term ended before the review could be completed, and it was quickly shelved under a Biden administration eager to address growing terror threats through continued military partnerships.\n\nMight a second Trump administration return to this \u201cAmerica first\u201d deployment strategy in Africa? Writing in Foreign Affairs, Trump\u2019s once and perhaps future national security advisor, Robert O\u2019Brien, argued that \u201cthe Pentagon should consider deploying the entire Marine Corps to the Pacific, relieving it in particular of missions in the Middle East and North Africa.\u201d But Africa looks far different today than when Trump was in office. The threat from violent extremist organizations has metastasized across the Sahel, and Russia is now a significant player on the security landscape in an increasing number of African states. After expulsions from Chad and Niger over the summer, the U.S. force presence is now even smaller than when Trump was president. As part of a de-emphasized military-first approach, the Biden administration is pursuing a more holistic policy toward these expanding security threats, with Vice President Harris announcing a $100 million assistance package to frontline states seeking to build resiliency and local-level community efforts to prevent extremist recruitment\u2014an approach a Harris presidency appears poised to continue.\n\nBut taking a step back, much of Africa remains largely skeptical of an expanded U.S. military presence on the continent. With the U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) already previewing potential new bases for U.S. forces in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Benin, Chad, and Libya, a Trump approach that seeks to actively limit U.S. military presence on the continent could be seen as a welcome change. However, frontline states in West Africa dealing with the encroaching threats from jihadi groups in the Sahel may see such curtailment of U.S. power projection as undermining their own security. It will be difficult for either administration to calibrate the proper disposition of U.S. power. Critical to this endeavor will be letting African leaders and their publics lead in setting the terms of engagement, something the Department of Defense has struggled to do in places like Chad and Niger, which have expelled U.S. forces in recent months.\n\nIt will be difficult for either administration to calibrate the proper disposition of U.S. power. Critical to this endeavor will be letting African leaders and their publics lead in setting the terms of engagement.\n\nGreat Power Competition\n\nOne of the memories Africa carries of Trump\u2019s time in office was his view of the continent as a chessboard to check China\u2019s growing malign ambitions. The framing of U.S. relations with Africa in the context of great power competition harkens back to Cold War\u2013era policies that created zones of influence in Africa and proxy conflicts that undermined the continent\u2019s political and economic development for decades. While the Biden administration has been careful to frame U.S. engagements in Africa as being strategically important for a host of other reasons, its choice of partners suggests that China remains a main driver of U.S. engagement in Africa.\n\nThe favor that Washington over the past two administrations has shown to Angola, a state with spotty human rights and governance performance and an even worse track record on corruption, is a case in point. Started under Trump, the Biden administration has rapidly accelerated a charm offensive with Angola, as seen by repeated visits by Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin to Luanda, the hosting of Angolan president Jo\u00e3o Manuel Gon\u00e7alves Louren\u00e7o at the Oval Office, and Biden himself preparing to visit Angola in October in his only trip to Africa as president. This reflects an unprecedented campaign to claw Angola back from the Communist orbit it inhabited for decades.\n\nSimilar U.S. attention has been heaped on Equatorial Guinea, a country with an even more abysmal human rights record but plentiful natural gas deposits that has expressed its openness to hosting a Chinese naval base. A parade of senior U.S. officials has visited President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, Africa\u2019s longest-serving leader at 42 years in office, and his heir-apparent son, proving that China can be kept at bay\u2014mostly when Washington is willing to suspend its values-driven approach.\n\nAfricans see this double standard and, in many cases, are doing what they can to stoke U.S.-China competition for their own benefit. Both Harris and Trump appear poised to continue to play the game, which in the long run will only further undermine Washington\u2019s already strained credibility in Africa\u2014that is, unless efforts to keep China at bay are recast not as explicitly trying to contain or undermine China, but as being motivated by a deeper desire to improve U.S. bilateral relations with African nations.\n\nClimate\n\nAfrica experiences the global climate crisis in a multitude of ways despite being the continent least responsible for it. For years, African leaders have decried Western-imposed climate policies that limit the kinds of energy Africa can access, the mechanisms it can use to finance new energy projects, and the added environmental conditions imposed on their development. In an Economist commentary in 2022, Nigeria\u2019s vice president argued, \u201cRich countries, especially in Europe, have repeatedly called for African states to use only renewable power sources. . . . The renewables-only mantra is also driven by unjustified fears of the continent\u2019s future emissions. Yet under no plausible scenario is Africa a threat to global climate targets.\u201d\n\nThe Biden administration, for its part, has acknowledged some of this but has not used its leverage in institutions such as the World Bank to lift bans on fossil fuel financing, including and especially for natural gas projects, as Africans have called for. Interestingly, this is perhaps a policy where a Trump administration might better align with African states\u2019 policy objectives. As a recent Heritage Foundation paper argues, \u201cIt\u2019s obscene for aid agencies to demand that Africans forgo economic growth to satisfy Western fears of climate catastrophe. A conservative foreign-aid policy should prioritize real people over climate paranoia.\u201d But with so far to go to meet their energy demands, Africans want more than a simple acknowledgement of the issue; they want to see tangible progress. The U.S. administration willing to push back against current climate-finance orthodoxy will find deals to be done in Africa that reap positive externalities beyond the energy sector.\n\nImmigration\n\nNo U.S. domestic political issue is likely to be felt more in Africa than the topic of immigration. Africans remember clearly the painful language used by President Trump when he enacted his first \u201cMuslim ban\u201d during his first hours in office. A new, and possibly expanded, prohibition on citizens from a host of Muslim-majority African countries entering the United States could well set back relations with the continent before any other Africa policy can even be formulated.\n\nCountries such as Sudan, Libya, and Somalia\u2014whose citizens were previously banned from travel to the United Sates\u2014would likely join an even wider list under a second Trump administration owing to the increased illegal migration of West Africans across the southern U.S. border in recent years. That many of these African migrants originate in countries now deemed by AFRICOM as representing a new epicenter of jihadi violence in the world increases the odds that a Trump administration could ban more Africans from U.S. shores. While promises of immigration bans, strict vetting, and \u201cmass deportations,\u201d as spelled out in the Republican platform, appeal to a certain American electorate, such far-reaching policies have the potential to undermine every aspect of U.S. engagement in Africa.\n\nSocial Issues\n\nOne element that continues to rile U.S. partners in Africa is Washington\u2019s tendency to impose its own social values on global development policy. Whether it is the requirement that countries respect and extend LGBTQ rights as laid out in Biden administration policy, likely to be continued under a Harris administration, or the prohibitions on family-planning and abortion funding supported by successive Republican administrations, both parties have a history of imposing their respective mores on African partners.\n\nTo this end, Uganda was suspended last year from the AGOA program and saw multiple rounds of visa restrictions and financial sanctions imposed on Ugandan officials over the passage of a bill that criminalizes same-sex relations. At the same time, $1 billion in President\u2019s Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) funding\u2014the wildly popular, bipartisan effort to fight HIV/AIDS across Africa\u2014was held up over Republican claims that the program was also funding abortions overseas.\n\nAs a recent Heritage Foundation study on U.S. development assistance notes:\n\n\u201cWashington should devote its limited [development] resources to programming that all Americans can support, not partisan pet projects. Pursuing the latter will only further divide a polarized country and result in poor outcomes around the world. African countries, for instance, resent tying aid to what they consider to be ideological colonialism and routinely point out that China attaches no such strings to its aid.\u201d\n\nWhile recognizing that this challenge to U.S. development policy is perhaps half the battle, it is unlikely that either a Trump or Harris administration would abandon its \u201cpartisan pet projects,\u201d even if it means ceding more ground to U.S. global competitors. This approach is likely to complicate relations with Africa for years to come.\n\nConclusion\n\nA new U.S. administration comes into office next January and will immediately have to grapple with a host of security and political challenges gripping African states, from the civil war in Sudan to spreading extremism in the Sahel to instability in the Great Lakes region. Addressing these challenges will require local partners and local knowledge to craft a response tailored to the specific circumstances driving each issue. However, so much of the overall U.S. policy agenda toward Africa, from trade to finance to development to climate, is being set elsewhere and then applied unevenly to the continent in ways that do not fully address Africans\u2019 needs or achieve the United States\u2019 desired impact.\n\nAs the global competition for influence mounts on this increasingly strategic continent, African leaders will be looking to see that their interests have been heard and are being acted upon. This will require the United States to not only tailor responses to meet their specific concerns, but also refrain from imposing its own domestic political fights on its partners. African leaders and Washington have both benefited from the bipartisan political consensus that has defined their relations for decades. But if this bipartisanship erodes further, the United States risks ceding even more influence to its competitors and further alienating a continent that already sees it as unreliable. Washington\u2019s own ability to arrest and reverse this trend will do much to determine the strength of relations with the continent well past the incoming administration.\n\nCameron Hudson is a senior fellow in the Africa Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C.\n\nThis report is made possible by general support to CSIS.

        "text": "US warns voters of disinformation deluge\nAmerican voters are likely about to be swamped by a flood of misinformation and influence campaigns engineered by U.S. adversaries aiming, according to senior U.S. intelligence officials, to sway the results of the upcoming presidential election and cast doubt on the process itself.\n\nThe latest assessment from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, issued Monday, comes just 29 days before the November 5 election that will see U.S. voters choose the country's next president and cast ballots in hundreds of other state and local races.\n\n\"We've continued to see actors ramp up their activities as we get closer to Election Day,\" said a senior U.S. intelligence official, briefing reporters on the condition of anonymity.\n\n\"They recognize that individuals are already voting, and operations can have a greater impact as we get closer to Election Day,\" the official said, noting that the election itself may just be a starting point.\n\n\"The intelligence community expects foreign influence actors to continue their campaigns by calling into question the validity of the election results after the polls close,\" the official added.\n\nA second U.S. intelligence official warned the pace of such influence efforts, especially those targeting specific races or political campaigns, has also picked up.\n\n\"We have had more than a threefold increase,\" the official said, explaining that the number of private briefings to candidates and campaigns has likewise jumped.\n\nIntelligence agencies also cautioned that U.S. adversaries will likely seize upon the damage done by Hurricane Helene and potential damage from Hurricane Milton as it strengthens off the U.S. coastline to further amplify and manufacture narratives meant to undermine confidence in the election results.\n\n\"It does take time for those types of narratives to be formed and put out into the wild, so to speak,\" the first intelligence official said. \"But we certainly expect foreign countries to take advantage of such situations and promote further divisive rhetoric.\"\n\nMonday's assessment follows a series of earlier public warnings about foreign efforts to meddle in the U.S. election.\n\nU.S. officials said Monday that Russia, Iran and China continue to be responsible for most of the influence efforts targeting U.S. voters.\n\nAnd, they said, there have been no indications that any of those countries have changed their goals.\n\nRussia, they said, continues to run influence campaigns aimed at boosting the chances of former U.S. President and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, while seeking to hurt the campaign of Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee.\n\nIran's efforts remain focused on helping Harris by hurting Trump, they said, pointing to the ongoing hack-and-leak operation against the Trump campaign, which has been traced to three operatives working for Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.\n\nTargeting state, local races\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies assess that China has yet to wade into the U.S. presidential campaign, focusing instead on persuading American voters to reject state and local candidates perceived as detrimental to Beijing's interests, especially those voicing support for Taiwan.\n\nBut the latest public assessment pointed to some changes.\n\nU.S. intelligence officials on Monday warned that Russia and Cuba have joined China, in targeting congressional, state and local races.\n\n\"Moscow is leveraging a wide range of influence actors in an effort to influence congressional races, particularly to encourage the U.S. public to oppose pro-Ukraine policies and politicians,\" the intelligence official said.\n\n\"Havana almost certainly has considered influence efforts targeting some candidates,\" the official added. \"This is consistent with what they've done in past cycles.\"\n\nRussia, China and Iran have all rejected previous U.S. accusations of election meddling. Russia, Iran and Cuba have yet to respond to requests from VOA for comment on the latest U.S. findings.\n\nChina late Monday again dismissed the U.S. concerns.\n\n\"China is not interested in the U.S. congressional election, and we have no intention and will not interfere in it,\" Liu Pengyu, the spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, told VOA in an email.\n\n\"Some U.S. congressmen stick to their wrong positions on the Taiwan question,\" Liu added. \"China firmly defends its national sovereignty and territorial integrity, but this does not lead to the conclusion that China has interfered in the congressional elections.\"\n\nBut the U.S. intelligence assessments align with concerns voiced by some lawmakers and private technology companies.\n\n\"The 48 hours after the polls close, especially if we have as close an election as we anticipate, could be equally if not more significant in terms of spreading false information, disinformation and literally undermining the tenets of our democracy,\" Mark Warner, chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said during a hearing last month.\n\n'Vigorous activity'\n\nMicrosoft President Brad Smith, who has warned that the most perilous moments could come in the 48 hours before the U.S. election, separately said the increase in malign cyber efforts by Russia and Iran, especially, is undeniable.\n\n\"We're seeing vigorous activity,\" Smith told a cyber conference last month. \"We're seeing the Iranians really target the Republican Party in the Trump campaign,\" he said. \"We're seeing the Russians target the Democratic Party and now the Harris campaign.\"\n\nAnd it is unclear what impact the U.S. has made with its attempts to counter the growing number of foreign influence efforts.\n\nLast month, the U.S. Justice Department seized 32 internet domains used by companies linked to Moscow to spread disinformation. At the same time, the department indicted employees of the state-controlled media outlet RT in connection with a plot to launder Russian propaganda through a U.S.-based media company.\n\nU.S. intelligence officials on Monday, however, said such tactics are no longer unique to the Kremlin.\n\n\"Foreign influence actors are getting better at hiding their hand and using Americans to do it,\" said one of the U.S. intelligence officials. \"Foreign countries calculate that Americans are more likely to believe other Americans compared to content with clear signs of foreign propaganda.\"\n\nArizona Democratic Senator Mark Kelly told CBS' \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday that social media is rife with fake personas generated by U.S. adversaries.\n\n\"If you're looking at stuff on Twitter, on TikTok, on Facebook, on Instagram, and it's political in nature \u2026 there is a very reasonable chance \u2014 I would put it in the 20 to 30% range \u2014 that the content you are seeing, the comments you are seeing, are coming from one of those three countries: Russia, Iran, China,\" he said. \"It's not going to stop on November 5.\"",

        "text": "U.S. presidential election: This could be great news for Kamala Harris.\nWelcome to How Good Is This, Really?\u2014renamed from the original How Bad Is This, Really?\u2014a recurring feature in which we take the temperature of the presidential election and what seems likely to happen in November.\n\nUntil Tuesday morning, it seemed like nothing was moving the presidential polls, even though there was a lot going on in the news.\n\nFirst J.D. Vance and Tim Walz participated in what, by vice presidential debate standards, was a fairly eventful faceoff in which both of them got some of what they were looking for. Disastrous flooding rocked the swing state of North Carolina, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s response became the subject of various online MAGA hoaxes. There was an East Coast dockworkers strike that had the potential to create a kind of mini-COVID supply-chain crisis in the last month of the race, but then the strike got called off, reportedly with the assistance of Biden administration mediators. The Bureau of Labor Statistics released a report showing surprisingly strong growth in U.S. employment.\n\nAnd throughout all of that \u2026 the polls and the forecast odds stayed pretty much the same, with Kamala Harris as a very slight favorite to beat Donald Trump.\n\nRelated From Slate A Presidential Race Twist That Must Infuriate Republicans Read More\n\nUntil Tuesday morning, when everything changed forever (unless what we\u2019re about to describe was just the result of random variation and we\u2019ll be back to the status quo as soon as the next poll comes out). That\u2019s when the New York Times released its newest Times/Siena College poll, which shows Harris with a 4-point lead nationally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, you might be asking: Wait, wasn\u2019t Harris already averaging a 3-point lead in national polls? And yes, that\u2019s true. Four points is only barely more than 3 points. But Harris hadn\u2019t ever led Trump nationally in this particular poll, whose methodology and track record are particularly well-regarded; the two were tied, according to Times/Siena, just last month. The poll also found Harris making underlying progress against Trump on the question of who \u201crepresents change\u201d in the election\u2014change being what a majority of voters are looking for, at the moment\u2014and who would best handle the economy, which is what a plurality of voters describe as the most important issue currently on the table.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the latter subject, Harris trails Trump by a 48\u201346 margin. And while trailing by 2 on an issue is not winning the issue, technically speaking, even getting close to even is a major triumph for her campaign given how bad Joe Biden\u2019s economy numbers were.\n\nHow did she do it? One theory would be that she\u2019s sold voters on the idea that she is more prepared to address the \u201ccost of living\u201d than Trump is. That effort continued Tuesday: In an appearance on The View, she announced a plan to pay for long-term home health care through the Medicare program. That would, to put it mildly, be game-changer for millions of older Americans and their families. Also, by almost every measure, the economy actually has been doing better lately, which is usually good for incumbent presidential administrations. (That said: It was definitely still a strategic gaffe for Harris to tell The View\u2019s hosts that she couldn\u2019t think of anything she would have done differently than Biden has, given the persistence of the electorate\u2019s disdain for the current president.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost importantly, the Times/Siena poll is a huge, permanent validation for this guy, whoever he is:\n\nI am going to predict here that when you combine Harris fighting to a draw on the economy in several recent polls, and her favorability advantage, it's going to add up to a bump soon (unless there's some intervening major story). \u2014 Ben Mathis-Lilley (@BenMathisLilley) September 27, 2024\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe conclude this column with a rating on the Shovel Meter, a measure of exactly how sedated you might want to be, on a scale of one to five shovel blows to the head, if you\u2019re concerned about Trump\u2019s reelection.\n\nToday, two shovels, one for the New York Times and one for Siena College, which, as we all knew before looking it up just now, is located in Loudonville, New York.

        "text": "30 Day Election Security Update from the Intelligence Community\nTHE WASHINGTON FOREIGN PRESS CENTER, WASHINGTON, D.C.\n\nMODERATOR: Hello, and welcome to the Washington Foreign Press Center\u2019s briefing on election security 30 days before Election Day. My name is Gini Staab at the U.S. Department of State, and I\u2019m the moderator for today\u2019s briefing. This briefing is on background. On the call today we have several experts. They will self-identify, and you can attribute their remarks to an ODNI official.\n\nBy participating in today\u2019s call, you are agreeing to these ground rules. We will share the transcript of this briefing later today. For journalists joining us, please take a moment to rename yourself in the chat with your name, outlet, and country.\n\nAnd with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to ODNI. Thank you so much.\n\nODNI OFFICIAL ONE: Hi there. Can I start with a mike check first? Can you hear me?\n\nMODERATOR: Sounds good. Thank you so much, yes.\n\nODNI OFFICIAL ONE: Okay. I\u2019m going to try to speak up, but if you can\u2019t hear me, please let me know.\n\nOur update today focuses mostly on foreign actors seeking to influence races other than the one for president. Before we get into those details, I\u2019ll begin by setting the scene. Today is 29 days out from Election Day, and a range foreign actors continue to try to influence U.S. elections as we approach November. These activities include broad efforts aimed at undermining trust in U.S. democratic processes and exacerbating divisions in our society, while also seeking to shape voter preferences towards specific candidates.\n\nOur assessments about the activities and goals of Russia, Iran, and China are unchanged from earlier election security updates.\n\nOn the presidential race, the Intelligence Community continues to assess that Russia prefers the former president and Iran prefers the Vice President. We also continue to assess that China is not seeking to influence the presidential election.\n\nAs we approach Election Day, the Intelligence Community is also stressing that foreign efforts to undermine America\u2019s democracy won\u2019t end on November 5th. The Intelligence Community expects foreign influence actors to continue their campaigns by calling into question the validity of the election\u2019s results after the polls close. These foreign actors are almost certainly considering the possibility of another contested presidential election in a tight contest for control of both the Senate and the House of Representatives. Thus, in such a contested post-election atmosphere, foreign actors probably will use tactics similar to those they are using today to undermine trust in the integrity of the election and election processes, as well as to further exacerbate divisions among Americans.\n\nNow, turning to foreign efforts to target congressional and other races, the Intelligence Community assesses some foreign actors \u2013 particularly Russia, China, and Cuba \u2013 are supporting or denigrating candidates involved in congressional, state, and local races. To determine which candidates to support or oppose, foreign actors evaluate how they think an individual candidate\u2019s foreign policy positions affect their national security interest.\n\nI\u2019ll start by talking about the big three actors we\u2019ve been tracking to date and moving on to others.\n\nFirst, Russia: Moscow is leveraging a wide range of influence actors in an effort to influence congressional races, particularly to encourage the U.S. public to oppose pro-Ukraine policies and politicians. Russian influence actors have planned, and likely created and disseminated, content, particularly over social media, intended to encourage the election of congressional candidates that Moscow assesses will oppose aid to Ukraine.\n\n(Simultaneous telephone call begins.)\n\nODNI OFFICIAL ONE: China: Beijing is seeking to influence congressional races and candidates, regardless of political affiliation, perceived by Beijing to threaten its core interests, especially in relation (inaudible) to Taiwan.\n\nIran: The IC has not observed Tehran seeking to influence congressional or state and local races during this election cycle. This is consistent with Iran\u2019s approach in 2020, though the IC continues to monitor \u2013\n\nMODERATOR: [ODNI Official One], I\u2019m sorry to interrupt you. Just one second. We have a call going on there as well that we can hear through your mike. Okay, so \u2013 sorry, [ODNI Official One], could you just pick that up again, please?\n\nODNI OFFICIAL ONE: Yeah. Stand by one moment.\n\n(Simultaneous telephone call concludes.)\n\nODNI OFFICIAL ONE: Thanks very much. I think the mike caught all of that.\n\nMODERATOR: Yes, sorry. That was quite loud. Yep.\n\nODNI OFFICIAL ONE: Okay. This has got to be on my phone.\n\nMODERATOR: Stand by, everyone, please.\n\nODNI OFFICIAL ONE: All right, we\u2019re going to try it again. (Inaudible) hearing me okay?\n\nMODERATOR: Yes, just until the telephone call.\n\nODNI OFFICIAL ONE: Okay.\n\nMODERATOR: Thank you so much.\n\nODNI OFFICIAL ONE: All right. I\u2019m not really sure. Maybe go back to Russia? Any sense to where we \u2014\n\nMODERATOR: Yes, right there would be great. Mm-hmm.\n\nODNI OFFICIAL ONE: All right. Apologies for that. We\u2019re having some audio issues today. So Russia. Moscow is leveraging a wide range of influence actors in an effort to influence congressional races, particularly to encourage the U.S. public to oppose pro-Ukraine policies and politicians. Russian influence actors have planned and likely created and disseminated content, particularly over social media, intended to encourage the election of congressional candidates that Moscow assesses will oppose aid to Ukraine.\n\nChina. Beijing is seeking to influence congressional races with candidates, regardless of party affiliation, perceived by Beijing to threaten its core interests, especially in relation of relations with Taiwan.\n\nIran. The IC has not observed Tehran seeking to influence congressional or state and local races during this election cycle. This is consistent with Tehran\u2019s approach in 2020, though the IC continues to monitor for any change to its strategy.\n\nThe IC is also monitoring other foreign actors who are conducting or have considered influence operations to support or oppose specific candidates beyond the presidential race. These operations are typically focused on particular candidates, tailored for specific demographics or constituencies, and use tactics such as posting on social media platforms, seeding articles in the U.S. media, or illicitly funding campaigns.\n\nCuba, for example, probably views this year\u2019s election as consequential. Havana almost certainly has considered influence efforts targeting some candidates. Havana may be, as it has done in previous cycles, trying to curry favor from congressional and sub-national politicians that it believes will support its preferred policies.\n\nI\u2019m going to pass to my colleague now.\n\nODNI OFFICIAL TWO: Hi. Thanks very much for joining us on this call. We\u2019re releasing this this election security update as part of our efforts to proactively share information about foreign threats to U.S. elections. As you\u2019ve heard, the election security update we\u2019re releasing today addresses foreign adversary efforts to undermine trust in our democratic institutions and to shape voter preferences.\n\nSince our last update, ODNI has continued to work alongside its interagency partners to proactively address foreign threats to U.S. elections. We continue to brief critical stakeholders, including Congress, state and local election officials, candidates, campaigns, and committees to exchange information with industry on evolving foreign threat actor tools, tactics, and procedures, to ensure that both we and they have an up-to-date perspective on the landscape and to provide (inaudible) and the broader \u2013 excuse me \u2013 up-to-date information on foreign threats to our elections. We will continue to publicly release as much information as possible, as we are today. We will issue our next election security update 15 days ahead of the election. Thank you.\n\nMODERATOR: I\u2019m sorry, just one more interruption. We can\u2019t hear you, and a couple of the journalists are just saying they can\u2019t hear. Is it possible for you to get closer to the mike? I apologize.\n\nODNI OFFICIAL TWO: Okay, hi. Is this better?\n\nMODERATOR: Excellent. Thank you so much.\n\nODNI OFFICIAL TWO: Okay, great. Hi. So thanks very much for joining us on this call. As I said, we\u2019re releasing this election security update today as part of our efforts to proactively share information about foreign threats to our elections. As you\u2019ve heard, the document addresses foreign adversary efforts to undermine trust in our democratic institutions and to shape voter preferences.\n\nSince our last update, ODNI has continued working alongside interagency partners to proactively address foreign threats to U.S. elections. We continue to brief critical stakeholders, including Congress, state and local election officials, candidates, campaigns, and committees, to exchange information with industry on evolving foreign threat actor tools, tactics, and procedures to ensure that both we and they have an up-to-date perspective on the landscape and to provide up-to-date information on foreign threats to our elections.\n\nWe will continue working to publicly release as much information as possible, as we are doing today, and we\u2019ll issue our next election security update 15 days ahead of the election. Let me turn it back to you now, Jenny, to carry us forward.\n\nMODERATOR: Thank you so much and that was excellent. Wonderful. We really appreciate the audio was perfect there at the end. So thank you so much for those remarks and now I\u2019d like to open it up for questions. As a reminder to journalists, please be sure your screenname includes your name and media outlet. To ask a question, click the raised hand icon on the bottom of your screen or type your question in the chat. We had \u2013 did have a couple advance questions that I\u2019d like to ask first. One is from Oskar Gorzynski from the Polish Press: \u201cDo you have any assessment on how successful Russian influence operations have been to date, and how confident are you about the safety of voting systems and procedures from foreign interference?\u201d\n\nODNI OFFICIAL ONE: Hi there. Can you hear me okay now?\n\nMODERATOR: Wonderfully. Thank you.\n\nODNI OFFICIAL ONE: All right. The U.S. Intelligence Community does not evaluate the effectiveness of foreign influence operations because doing so would require us to evaluate protected free speech in the United States. So that is not a role for the Intelligence Community. As far as the safety of voting systems and procedures, what I would say there is we have not seen foreign efforts to date to attack the integrity of voting systems. A lot of the activity we\u2019re seeing so far is influence \u2013 influence operations or information operations, and some of those operations do question the integrity of the voting, if that distinction is clear.\n\nMODERATOR: Thank you so much. Our next question comes from Saurabh Shukla from NewsMobile, India. \u201cAre you aware of any disinformation campaign targeting election integrity from bad actors in Russia and China, and how are you dealing with this?\u201d\n\nODNI OFFICIAL ONE: As far as disinformation campaigns, we would say yes, there are information campaigns from some of these actors, particularly Russia and Iran, that seek to question the legitimacy or the integrity of the election, including election systems. And as we noted in our opening remarks, we expect these actors to continue their information operations after election day and after polls close to question the legitimacy of the election. And I\u2019ll turn to my colleague for anything to add on what we do about it.\n\nODNI OFFICIAL TWO: Sure. Hi. I mean, I can just add that our efforts with this election security update and others is to provide as much information as we can with the broader public about the types of activity that we\u2019re seeing. When we have intelligence about a particular threat, one that might target a particular individual, we have the ability to provide what we call defensive briefing or private notification directly to the target or the conduit about influence operations so that they can take steps to protect themselves and to mitigate that activity. Thanks.\n\nMODERATOR: Thank you so much. And we\u2019ll now turn to Rahim Rashidi from Kurdistan TV, Iraq. Please unmute yourself and ask your question.\n\nQUESTION: Yeah, thank you very much for this opportunity. We have seen several reports indicating that Iranian actors have tried to hack U.S. officials and interfered in the U.S. presidential election campaign. I know you\u2019re talking about Russia and China as well, but I am focused on Iran. How serious is this threat and what should the U.S. response be? Thank you very much.\n\nODNI OFFICIAL ONE: Hi there. Your statement is correct. Iran poses a significant foreign influence threat to U.S. elections. Our assessment is Iran continues efforts to fuel distrust in U.S. political institutions and increase social discord and, of course, as you noted and a variety of U.S. Government indictments and public statements have noted, efforts to influence the presidential race through the hack-and-leak operation against former President Trump.\n\nMODERATOR: Thank you very much. Nuaman Ishfaq Mughal from Parliament Times. Do you have a question, please?\n\nQUESTION: Thank you very much. Nuaman Ishfaq Mughal from Pakistan. My question is that in last month State Department sanctioned official Russian TV outlet RT for interference in election. Was any significant damage was done by RT before the sanctions?\n\nODNI OFFICIAL ONE: Hi there. As to your question about damage, that gets into the effectiveness of operations. But I\u2019m happy to talk a bit about the way Russia conducts these operations or their approach, and their approach is essentially to better hide their hand. Russia uses a variety of techniques to obscure that it\u2019s Russian influence operations, and they conduct these operations through two primary means.\n\nOne is they use influence-for-hire firms, or commercial firms with expertise in these type of activities. So \u2013 and the other is to coopt witting and unwitting Americans to work on Russia\u2019s behalf, and those were some of the activities you highlighted. And both of these efforts are designed to launder their influence narratives through what are perceived as more authentic U.S. voices.\n\nMODERATOR: Thank you so much. And now we\u2019ll turn to Paolo Mastrolilli from La Repubblica, Italy.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you very much for the briefing. This year while also a significant election here in Europe, in several country. I was wondering if during your research you noticed also some malignant activity to interfere with democracy in Italy and in other European country. What did you notice and what should European country do in order to defend themselves?\n\nODNI OFFICIAL ONE: Yeah, that is a little outside the scope of the briefing. I apologize that we\u2019re not able to provide information on that today.\n\nMODERATOR: Thank you. And we have another advance question with regards to congressional elections. \u201cWhat are you seeing in congressional elections in the battleground states, and do you \u2013 are you assessing that that is making a difference in the outcomes of these elections?\u201d\n\nODNI OFFICIAL ONE: Russia in particular has targeted swing states for a variety of its influence efforts, and a lot of the operations we see across the country, but in swing states in particular, are information operations to include social media activity, fake websites that purport to be U.S. news websites, and similar activity. And again, we cannot comment on the effectiveness of these operations.\n\nMODERATOR: Thank you. And you\u2019ve mentioned that Cuba has now entered the fray or is considering entering the fray into elections interference. Can you speak a little bit about Cuba and their experience in this election?\n\nODNI OFFICIAL ONE: Yes, sure. Havana is very focused on a few policy issues that it believes to be negatively impacting the regime, particularly the U.S. embargo on Cuba and other economic and travel restrictions, all of which Havana perceives as an effort to force regime change. Havana considers election influence activities as part of its standing requirements to influence those policies, and Florida is a prime target of their activities. To that end, we have observed Cuba tailoring influence activities based on its perception of a candidate\u2019s stances on policies toward Cuba. For example, in 2020 Havana intended to denigrate specific candidates in Florida and pushed influence narratives to the Latin American community in the United States.\n\nMODERATOR: Okay, thank you so much. Unfortunately, that\u2019s all the time our briefers have for today. This ends our Q&A session. As a reminder, this briefing has been on background and you can attribute their remarks to ODNI officials. I want to give a special thanks to our briefers for sharing their time with us today, and to the journalists who\u2019ve joined us via Zoom. Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s briefing.",

But she did expound on her views about two foreign leaders causing enormous headaches for President Biden\u2019s administration: Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, and Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president.\n\nLess than a month before Election Day, Ms. Harris\u2019s interview with CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d \u2014 the longstanding most-watched news program on television \u2014 came at a moment of increased exposure and pressure.

Tim Walz of Minnesota.\n\nHarris was in control of her message, but avoided repeated pushback.\n\nFrom the opening seconds, Ms. Harris seemed calm and in command of the points she wanted to make \u2014 and she did not stray from them despite repeated follow-up questions. She avoided pushback when asked to detail how to end the yearlong war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. And she declined repeatedly to say whether the Biden-Harris administration should have acted earlier to restrict illegal immigration into the United States.\n\nWhen Mr. Whitaker asked her if the administration had lost all sway over Mr. Netanyahu, Ms. Harris said, \u201cThe work that we do diplomatically with the leadership of Israel is an ongoing pursuit around making clear our principles.\u201d\n\nMr. Whitaker pushed again: \u201cIt seems that Prime Minister Netanyahu is not listening.\u201d\n\nMs. Harris responded, \u201cWe are not going to stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end\u201d \u2014 an answer that did not address the volatile diplomatic tension at the heart of the question.\n\nShe has a Glock, and she knows how to use it.\n\nSince beginning her short, intense campaign, Ms. Harris has offered up few new details about herself, but on Monday she answered a couple of questions about being a longtime gun owner.\n\nShe said she owned a Glock, a popular pistol that is the handgun of choice for many in law enforcement \u2014 perhaps fitting for a former California attorney general, San Francisco district attorney and a local prosecutor before that.\n\n\u201cLook, my background is in law enforcement,\u201d she said, \u201cand so there you go.\u201d\n\nYes, the vice president said with a laugh, of course she had fired the weapon. She quickly added: at a shooting range.\n\nHarris was pressed about \u2018dealing with the real world\u2019 on some of her plans.\n\nMs. Harris was asked several times about her plans to pay for her economic proposals, including a $6,000 child tax credit for families with infants. She vowed to raise taxes on the highest earners before Mr. Whitaker pushed back: \u201cWe\u2019re dealing with the real world here,\u201d he said. She said she believed that congressional leaders were privately willing to engage on the issue.\n\n\u201cWhen you talk quietly with a lot of folks in Congress, they know exactly what I\u2019m talking about,\u201d she said, ignoring a reality she has encountered as Mr. Biden\u2019s No. 2: Discussions in private that seem promising do not always lead to public policy.\n\nStill, Ms. Harris said she would need Congress to act on several proposals, including legislation that would continue to restrict immigration to the United States.\n\nShe has warned Tim Walz about misspeaking.\n\nImage Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota has made news lately for misstatements about his personal history. Credit... Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times\n\nWhen Mr. Walz has been in the news lately, it has been about his misrepresentations of his military record and travels to China.\n\nIt was perhaps an acknowledgment of these distractions from the carefully crafted Harris campaign agenda when Mr. Walz, after being asked about disagreements he has had with his running mate, said that she had told him to button up some of his loose language.\n\n\u201cShe said, \u2018Tim, you know, you need to be a little more careful on how you say things,\u2019\u201d Mr. Walz said.\n\nHe said any embellishments he had made paled in comparison to those of Mr. Trump, whom he called \u201ca pathological liar.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will own up to being a knucklehead at times,\u201d he said. \u201cThe folks closest to me know that I keep my word.\u201d\n\nNeither Liz Cheney nor Harris can quite believe they are allies now.\n\nDuring a brief exchange at Ms. Harris\u2019s event last week in Wisconsin with former Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, Mr. Whitaker asked the vice president what she would have said if someone had suggested four years ago that she would someday be campaigning with the archconservative Ms. Cheney.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019d be great,\u201d Ms. Harris said, laughing.\n\nMs. Cheney laughed, too. \u201cShe\u2019s really diplomatic,\u201d she said.\n\nMr. Whitaker then posed the same question to Ms. Cheney. Could she believe she was here, speaking at a campaign event for Ms. Harris?\n\nThe former Wyoming congresswoman couched her support as vital to preventing Mr. Trump\u2019s return to office.\n\n\u201cI hope that if you had said to me four years ago, \u2018Our Constitution is going to be under threat and it\u2019s going to be crucial for the parties to come together and to support Vice President Harris because she\u2019ll defend the rule of law,\u2019 I know I would\u2019ve said, \u2018That\u2019s exactly what I\u2019ll do,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nHer foreign policy would look a lot like Biden\u2019s.\n\nDiscussing the diplomatic crises that have unfolded throughout the Biden administration, including the expanding Mideast conflict and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Ms. Harris signaled that foreign policy in a Harris-Walz administration would hew closely to the policies of the Biden-Harris one.\n\nMs. Harris said she would not meet with Mr. Putin about ending the war in Ukraine without involving the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nShe again warned of what could happen if her Republican rival were in office: \u201cDonald Trump, if he were president, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv right now. He talks about, \u2018oh, he can end it on Day 1.\u2019 You know what that is. It\u2019s about surrender.\u201d\n\nBut Ms. Harris did not hesitate when asked which foreign country was \u201cour greatest adversary.\u201d Iran, she said, is \u201cthe obvious one.\u201d\n\n\u201cIran has American blood on their hands,\u201d she said, though she twice declined to engage in what she called hypothetical questions about what sort of military action she would take overseas.\n\nTrump turned down \u201860 Minutes.\u2019 Harris took advantage.\n\nOn the CBS show on Monday, Mr. Whitaker said Mr. Trump had agreed to an interview, then backed out, citing, among other things, the network\u2019s promise to fact-check him on the air.\n\nMs. Harris pounced on the opportunity to point out that Mr. Trump \u201cis not going to give your viewers the ability to have a meaningful, thoughtful conversation, question-and-answer with you.\u201d\n\nTo get an idea of the substance of Mr. Trump\u2019s policies, she said, \u201cWatch his rallies. You\u2019re going to hear conversations that are about himself and all of his personal grievances.\u201d",

        "text": "Leading political scientists discuss global perspectives on U.S. presidential election\nAt the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, or MIT\u2019s, Starr Forum Oct. 2, political science experts Katrina Burgess, Daniel Ziblatt, John Githongo and Prerna Singh joined MIT political science professor Evan Lieberman for a panel entitled \u201cThe 2024 US presidential election: The world is watching\u201d to discuss global perspectives on the upcoming U.S. presidential election. Each panelist covered a major continental viewpoint on what the next presidential administration means for international relations, and how each region will feel the effects of the next commander-in-chief.\n\n\u201cWe want to widen the aperture beyond our nation\u2019s borders and capture a sense of how the world is seeing our country,\u201d Lieberman said to a nearly full theater.\n\nThe first speaker was Burgess, who reflected on the viewpoints Latin American governments hold during this election season and which policies affect them. Burgess emphasized the range in support for each campaign issue amongst Latin Americans.\n\nStatistics show that a majority of people feel Harris would prioritize pathways to citizenship for immigrants while Trump would maintain border security. These same polls report that Latin Americans have low confidence that Trump will do the \u201cright\u201d thing regarding world affairs. The majority of respondents also agreed that the U.S. is no longer a good example of a democracy.\n\n\u201cLatin America does not appear in [Harris\u2019 or Trump\u2019s] platforms,\u201d Burgess added.\n\nThis raises the question, Burgess said: why is the U.S. leaving the closest geographic continent out of the discussion?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a benign neglect, punctuated by security threats. In the Cold War it was communism. In the 1990s it was the drug trade and since 9/11, it\u2019s really been migration and the border,\u201d Burgess said. \u201c\u2018Make America Great Again,\u2019 should include the Americas.\u201d\n\nNext came Ziblatt, discussing an overview of the relationship between Europe and the U.S. Europe recently became aware of several vulnerabilities caused by outsourcing necessary supplies. Constantly reliant on the state of other countries, they are exposed to what comes next in the U.S., he said.\n\nZiblatt referenced Pew Research Center statistics regarding trends in European political opinion. In Germany and the United Kingdom, there is overwhelming support for Harris, with the exception of the Alternative for Germany, a radical right party that follows similar policies to Trump\u2019s.\n\nTrump causes much uncertainty in the election for Europeans, Ziblatt explained. As president, Trump threatened members of NATO, saying he would not protect them over Russian president Vladimir Putin. This could delegitimize the U.S.\u2019s role in NATO and the reputation it holds in global affairs, Ziblatt said.\n\n\u201cAre European officials going to be willing to share intelligence with Trump?\u201d Ziblatt said. \u201cMaybe we need to hedge our risks here and start looking for allies elsewhere.\u201d\n\nGithongo spoke next, diving deeper into the African continent\u2019s opinion on the U.S. election. Githongo said U.S. democratic practices were important in influencing African democracies.\n\n\u201cThe U.S., across Africa, and its model of governance has been a shining house on the hill. \u2026 It is open and it is free,\u201d Githongo said. But when it comes down to the current election, the fate of influence remains uncertain.\n\nThere has been an outpouring of support in the streets of African countries for the Harris campaign by the younger generation, which makes up about 50% of Africa\u2019s population.\n\n\u201cThey express the sharpest moral clarity we\u2019ve had since the struggle for independence across Africa \u2026 very clear about international affairs and what they consider to be right and wrong,\u201d Githongo said.\n\nMany African countries have vocally supported Harris, especially after Trump referred to much of Africa as \u201cshithole\u201d countries and Trump\u2019s adverse visa policies, which affect the increasing number of African students traveling to the U.S. for university every year.\n\n\u201cThe United States is in trouble with Africa,\u201d Githongo said.\n\nRounding out the presentations was Singh, focusing on India and the upcoming election. Singh dove into how minimally the U.S. election is covered in India. This is, in part, due to a decline in freedom of press in India, she said. While policy and campaigns are marginally discussed in Indian media, there is one topic that shines through.\n\n\u201cThe one thing that has received a lot of coverage are presidential debates,\u201d Singh said. She attributed this specific focus to the democratic erosion that India is facing due to a rise in populist groups and leaders.\n\nThe majority of India supports the Democratic party in theory, Singh said. However, the Hindu National Party has endorsed Trump.\n\nSingh highlighted how consistently Harris is covered in the media, partially because of her maternal Indian heritage and partially because of her scolding Prime Minister Narendra Modi regarding human rights practices.\n\n\u201cThere was a time when the U.S. could dismiss India as a country \u2026 but those days are gone,\u201d Singh said. She said that India is the largest growing economy in the world, and as a result, the country worries less about the election in America than other global players may.\n\nThe News asked the panelists if they thought the once-prominent respect for U.S. democracy is lost.\n\n\u201cAmerica has experienced a democratic backslide,\u201d Ziblatt said. He acknowledged a downward trend in approval of U.S. democracy.\n\n\u201cDemocracy in the United States is important to people around the world,\u201d Githango said.",

        "text": "Officials in North Carolina, Georgia say Helene will not derail voting in presidential election\nOfficials in North Carolina, Georgia say Helene will not derail voting in presidential election\n\nElection officials in Georgia and North Carolina said Monday that voting from their states in the presidential election in November will not be derailed by the damage left by Hurricane Helene even as crews continue to search for victims.\n\nThough parts of the two states were devastated by the hurricane, election officials said they are working on plans to assure that every ballot cast for the Nov. 5 election will be counted.\n\n\u201cWhat has been on everyone\u2019s mind is what will happen to elections,\u201d Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said at a news conference Monday. \u201cGood news: Absentee ballots are going out this week as scheduled, and early voting will start next Tuesday, on Oct. 15.\"\n\nThe streets are flooded near Peachtree Creek after hurricane Helene brought in heavy rains over night, Sept. 27, 2024, in Atlanta. Megan Varner/Getty Images\n\nRaffensperger said that while Helene caused widespread damage and power outages in his state, he does not expect there to be any major disruptions to the general election. He said election offices and voting equipment in the state's 159 counties escaped serious damage.\n\nBlake Evans, elections director for the Georgia secretary of state\u2019s office, said county officials are assessing about 2,400 polling locations. So far, just three will have to be changed because of storm damage, he added.\n\nIn North Carolina, the state's Board of Elections unanimously approved on Monday a measure that would broaden the authority of local election officials in the counties most impacted by the disaster.\n\nBrad Raffensperger, Georgia's secretary of state, attends The Principles First 2024 Summit: Conserving America's Liberal Tradition, at the in Washington, D.C., Feb. 24, 2024.

It may look a little different in these affected counties, but we fully intend to offer early voting starting on the 17th,\" said Karen Brinson Bell, executive director of the North Carolina Board of Elections.\n\nAs of Monday, every county election office in North Carolina was opened, according to Bell, compared to last week when 14 of those offices were closed due to the storm. Bell thanked local election officials throughout the state for working to get their offices online while facing \u201cpersonal struggles\u201d including damage to their homes, transportation issues and a lack of basic utilities.\n\n\u201cWhat a difference a week makes ... this is just quite the feat,\u201d Bell said. \"Our struggles are not over, and that is why we need the Board to take action to give the flexibility necessary to carry out these elections, and to be of the best service to the voters that we can be.\"\n\nShe told reporters Monday that authorities could bring in National Guard tents or FEMA trailers to act as polling locations, and she insisted that it can be done securely and safely.\n\n\"It\u2019s not as spacious as your normal polling location, but it does provide the space necessary at the existing voting site if the parking lot [of a polling site is] still accessible,\" she said. \"[And] even in a temporary structure we can still maintain security of the voting equipment and safety of our workers.\u201d\n\nAn aerial view of flood damage along the French Broad River in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, Oct. 2, 2024, in Asheville, N.C. Mario Tama/Getty Images\n\nIn Yancey County, North Carolina, Board of Elections Director Mary Beth Tipton told ABC News that officials are still assessing how many of the county\u2019s 11 polling sites would be operational by Election Day. Most of the other polling sites are in schools and fire stations, which are currently being used as shelters and emergency relief sites, and two election stations were severely damaged by flood waters.\n\n\u201cThere are some of them that don\u2019t even exist anymore,\u201d Tipton said.\n\nOne of the hardest-hit counties was Buncombe County, which sustained historic flooding. The county includes Asheville, the eleventh-largest city in the state.\n\nAs of Monday, 67,000 utility customers remained without electricity and a large part of Buncombe County was without running water due to major damage to the water system and its water treatment plant, officials said. Recovery crews continued to search massive piles of debris for 60 people who remain unaccounted for, officials said.\n\n\"I'm here to reassure our community that Buncombe County will vote,\" Corinne Duncan, the director of Buncombe County Election Services, said at a news conference Monday.\n\nDuncan said she was concerned that some polling places would have to be changed due to the lack of water or power. She said most of the election offices and voting equipment were spared by the storm, but officials are working to \"strategize and modify plans\" to make sure anyone who wants to vote can do so.\n\nShe said officials are trying to get in touch with polling workers for training to make sure polling stations are staffed. As of now, early voting will begin as planned in Buncombe County and residents still have until Oct. 11 to register to vote, Duncan said.\n\n\"We are assessing what voting locations are available,\" said Duncan, adding, \"We must respect the gravity of our situation.\"",

The views expressed are those of the author, not necessarily Mongabay. See All Key Ideas\n\nAmerica\u2019s Endangered Species Act was weakened in 2019 through a series of sweeping changes. In March, previous protections were put back in place, and now a new poll shows conservatives and liberals across the nation overwhelmingly want the next U.S. President and Congress to do even more to protect endangered animals.\n\nThe new data comes from a biennial survey and offers a stark contrast to the partisan narratives often used to separate Americans \u2013 for the Indianapolis Zoological Society, we commissioned Atomik Research to conduct an online survey of 1,008 adults throughout the United States with a margin of error of +/- 3% with a confidence level of 95% \u2013 which shows that while the nation is certainly divided on many issues, there is encouraging common ground when it comes to wanting the next Administration and the 118th Congress to do more for wild things and wild places.\n\nConsider this: nearly nine in ten (87%) adults in America say that when thinking about the issues they will be voting on in the 2024 U.S. presidential election, a candidate\u2019s commitment to animal and environmental conservation is important in their decision. That\u2019s up from 80% when we asked the same question just before the 2020 U.S. presidential election. And sentiment among Republicans spiked the most (14%) over the last four years, going from 68% saying it was important in 2020 to 82% in 2024.\n\nStrong bipartisan agreement is also prevalent around Americans\u2019 expectations for the 118th U.S. Congress convening in January. More than eight in 10 (83%) Republicans believe the federal government should do more to strengthen the Endangered Species Act and more than nine in 10 (93%) Democrats say the same.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats across America are even finding common ground on the topic of climate change. While Democrats poll higher on these issues, nearly two in three (64%) Republicans now say climate change is a threat to species\u2019 survival, compared to 54% of Republicans saying the same in 2020. And nearly seven in 10 (67%) Republicans now say they are more concerned about protecting our planet today than they were five years ago.\n\nThis kind of agreement is hard to find in America today and it is encouraging. Americans across parties are increasingly calling for legislative actions to help save species and ecosystems, and the biggest new spikes of support are coming from conservative Republican voters.\n\nThe sentiment translates into commerce too. In 2020, only 65% of Republicans in the U.S. said they were more inclined to purchase products or services from a company that supports the protection of endangered animals. In 2024, that figure has spiked to nearly three in four (74%) Republicans who say the same. And a vast majority of Americans across party affiliation believe companies are not doing enough to preserve ecosystems and protect animals.\n\nThese increases are stunning, and we expect to see even more Republicans and Democrats coming together on these issues in the future. It\u2019s all part of a broader trend where more Americans are connecting with nature. Our national parks are seeing record attendance and many zoos and aquariums across the United States \u2013 including ours in Indianapolis \u2013 are also setting records as more Americans flock to connect with wildlife and wild places.\n\nIn the run up to the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 5, we will hear many stories about how divided the United States is. But there are also critical areas where Americans agree, and one of those is our overwhelming desire for the next president and congress to do more to protect endangered animals and ecosystems. That is common ground we should all support.\n\nDr. Robert Shumaker is President & CEO of the Indianapolis Zoological Society, whose signature conservation initiatives include the Indianapolis Prize and The Global Center for Species Survival.\n\nRelated audio from Mongabay\u2019s podcast: How a successful cross border (U.S., Mexico & Canada) effort has kept a deadly wildlife disease out of North America, listen here:\n\nSee related coverage:",

The term does not yet have the blockbuster potential of the term that ended in July . Guns are again on the docket as are cases involving gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors, disability discrimination and federal regulation of vapes .",
        "text": "A new Supreme Court term begins in the shadow of a presidential election\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of trepidation,\u201d said David Cole, national legal director of the ACLU, referring to election cases reaching the high court. \u201cIf the election is close, then there\u2019s a whole set of questions about voter access, counting ballots. I don\u2019t think the court wants to get involved, but it may be forced to.\u201d\n\nBut the new docket has enough cases that promise to keep the justices in the public eye in the months ahead. Guns are again on the docket as are cases involving gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors, age restrictions for access to online porn, disability discrimination and federal regulation of vapes. And the 2024 presidential election hovers over the docket like a dark cloud on a bright autumn day, pregnant with possible voting issues that may demand the court\u2019s attention.\n\nThe new term does not yet have the blockbuster potential of the term that ended in July. The prior term was packed with controversy, including three cases related to former President Donald Trump, gun regulation, two abortion cases, federal agencies\u2019 power, voting rights, a major opioid-related bankruptcy, social media regulation and more.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court opens a new term on the eve of an intense, historic election in which the justices may be called on to play a key role in the results.\n\nSome court scholars said the less intense docket this term may reflect the justices\u2019 desire to create space for post-election cases, if necessary.\n\n\u201cThey had to make space for the possibility\u201d there would be election cases, said Irv Gornstein, executive director of the Supreme Court Institute at Georgetown University Law Center. \u201cThey had to have that on their minds.\u201d\n\nIf Trump is elected, he suggested, there is a possible challenge to his holding office based on the insurrection clause in the 14th Amendment \u2014 even though the justices may have thought they ruled out such a case in their decision last term in a Colorado ballot case. And if Trump isn\u2019t elected, Gornstein added, \u201cThere\u2019s almost certainly a number of immunity cases they will have to decide\u201d related to ongoing criminal cases, a consequence of their separate decision last term awarding immunity for a president\u2019s \u201cofficial acts.\u201d\n\nWATCH: How the Supreme Court immunity ruling reshapes presidential power\n\nThe term also opens at a time when public approval of the institution is the lowest in decades. A series of ethics-related revelations involving Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito have damaged the court\u2019s image. Although the justices have adopted an ethics code after continuing outside criticism of them for lacking one, the new code does not have an enforcement mechanism. And sharply ideologically divided votes in culture-war cases appear to lend credence to some of the public\u2019s belief that the court is a partisan institution.\n\nBut for now, the justices are doing business as usual. They added 15 cases to their argument docket on Sept. 30 when they met to examine more than 1,000 petitions that had been filed over the summer or that had lingered from last term. They will continue to add to the docket until about mid-January when they traditionally have filled argument slots through April.\n\nHere is a brief look at key cases thus far that will be argued between now and the end of April.\n\nMore guns\n\nLast term, the court ruled that the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives could not ban bump stocks under the definition of \u201cmachine guns\u201d in federal law. This term, the justices face a similar case involving regulation of \u201cghost guns.\u201d Kits can be purchased online that allow anyone to assemble a gun quickly and without background checks. These ghost guns have no serial numbers and are largely untraceable.\n\nThe bureau issued a rule in 2022 that the definition of \u201cfirearm\u201d under the Gun Control Act of 1986 includes weapon parts kits that can be \u201creadily\u201d assembled into a firearm. The rule also states that the term \u201cframe or receiver,\u201d as referenced in the act\u2019s \u201cfirearm\u201d definition, includes \u201ca partially complete \u2026 frame or receiver.\u201d A lower court found that the bureau had exceeded its authority in issuing the rule. The Biden administration appealed to the Supreme Court (Garland v. Van der Stok.)\n\nThe second gun-related case, Smith & Wesson Brands v. Estados Unidos Mexicanos, came to the court from Mexico. That country charged Smith & Wesson and Interstate Arms with aiding the illegal trafficking of firearms to drug cartels in Mexico. A lower court refused to dismiss Mexico\u2019s suit under a 2005 federal law that shields gunmakers from liability for crimes committed with their guns.\n\nA transgender health care ban and reverse discrimination\n\nTennessee, like 25 other Republican-controlled states, passed legislation banning medical treatments intended to allow \u201ca minor to identify with, or live as, a purported identity inconsistent with the minor\u2019s sex\u201d at birth or to treat \u201cpurported discomfort or distress from a discordance between the minor\u2019s sex and asserted identity.\u201d In taking on United States v. Skrmetti, the justices agreed to decide whether the law discriminates on the basis of sex in violation of the equal protection clause.\n\nThe justices will also decide a woman\u2019s claim (Ames v. Ohio Dept. of Youth Services) that she was denied a promotion because she is heterosexual and her former boss, a gay woman, instead advanced two LGBTQ+ people. Marlean Ames, an Ohio government employee, challenges a court-imposed requirement that \u201cmajority\u201d Americans raising discrimination claims must demonstrate \u201cbackground circumstances,\u201d such as statistical evidence of a pattern of discrimination against a majority group, before their suits can proceed.\n\nFree speech and online porn access\n\nIn 2023, Texas joined a growing number of states that have passed laws requiring websites that publish sexual material deemed \u201charmful to minors\u201d to verify their users\u2019 age before they can access anything on the site. The Texas law also requires covered sites to prominently publish \u201csexual materials health warnings\u201d written by the government.\n\nIn Free Speech Coalition v. Paxton, the justices will decide what type of scrutiny \u2014 rational basis or strict scrutiny \u2014 to apply to the law, which the challengers contend unconstitutionally burdens users and compels speech..\n\nA fight over vapes\n\nWages and White Lion Investments makes flavored e-liquids containing nicotine for use in e-cigarettes, such as vapes. The company sought marketing approval from the Food and Drug Administration to continue making and selling its products. But the FDA denied premarketing approval after finding that the products did not show strong, reliable evidence to overcome the risks of youth addiction and benefits to adult smokers.\n\nThe company has challenged the FDA\u2019s denials, claiming it lacked authority to impose those requirements and acted arbitrarily and capriciously. A lower appellate court agreed with the company, and the FDA turned to the Supreme Court (FDA v. Wages and White Lion Investments).\n\nNot in my backyard!\n\nThe justices will return to an old and thorny issue: where to store nuclear waste. Texas challenged the Nuclear Regulatory Commission\u2019s plan to store 40,000 metric tons of waste in Texas\u2019 Permian Basin. A lower federal appellate court ruled that the federal agency did not have the authority to issue licenses to store the waste away from reactors.\n\nThe case, Nuclear Regulatory Commission v. Texas, could become another chapter in the conservative majority\u2019s recent efforts to rein in the power of federal regulatory agencies.",

They are designed to shut down vital systems and cause maximum delay and disruption to patient care . Government must go on the offensive, making it a priority to disrupt cybercriminals before the attack, he says .",
        "text": "A Look at 2024\u2019s Health Care Cybersecurity Challenges\nWith 386 health care cyber-attacks reported thus far in 2024, data-theft crimes and ransomware attacks against health care and our mission-critical third-party providers appear to be unfolding at the same elevated rate as in 2023, which was the worst year ever for breaches in health care. 1 The scope and impact of this year\u2019s breaches, however, have been much more profound.\n\nRansomware attacks are not just data-theft or financial crimes, they are threat-to-life crimes. And they are not just an IT issue, but a risk to every function of your enterprise. They are designed to shut down vital systems and cause maximum delay and disruption to patient care. They not only threaten the safety of patients in the hospital, but their effects cascade throughout the entire community and every hospital, clinic and emergency department in the surrounding region \u2014 what I call the blast radius.\n\nA perfect example of the blast radius effect is the far-reaching and lingering impact of the February attack on Change Healthcare, a third-party provider.\n\nAttacks on Third-Party Health Care Service Providers and Suppliers Are Rising\n\nThe ransomware attack on United HealthGroup\u2019s subsidiary Change Healthcare impacted every hospital in the country in one way or another and was the most significant and consequential cyberattack in U.S. health care history. Change Healthcare is the predominant source of more than 100 critical functions that keep the health care system operating, including management of clinical criteria used to authorize patient care and coverage, claims processing, and prescription drug processing. As a result of the shutdown to Change Healthcare\u2019s operations, patients struggled to get timely access to care, and billions of dollars stopped flowing to providers. This attack has shone a spotlight on third-party attacks and the need for health care organizations to prepare their business and clinical continuity procedures now for an extended loss of services caused by future cyberattacks.\n\nAttacks like these indicate that we will see a continued rise in the number of individuals affected by attacks on health care third-party business associates, a number that jumped by 287% from 2022 to 2023. 2 Learn more about the rise of ransomware attacks on third parties in my previous blog.\n\nCollaboration Emerging Between Hostile Nation-States and Ransomware Attackers\n\nNew threats are on the horizon. We are beginning to see more instances of international cooperation between nation-state-sponsored hackers and ransomware groups from other countries. In late August, for example, Iranian-based cyber actors leveraged unauthorized network access to U.S. organizations for espionage reasons, including to health care organizations, to facilitate and profit from ransomware attacks by Russian-affiliated ransomware gangs.\n\nGeopolitical Risks Continue\n\nGeopolitical risks threaten the health care sector\u2019s cybersecurity, with ransomware attacks typically originating in countries like Russia, China, North Korea and Iran, often with tacit permission from their host governments. Defense alone will not deter our cyber adversaries. Nor can hospitals tackle this complex problem on their own.\n\nWorking with our allies, the federal government must go on the offensive, making it a priority to disrupt cybercriminals before the attack. And it must do more to assist when an attack does occur, by disseminating threat intelligence, and by providing a whole-of-government response that leans on law enforcement, legislative, military and intelligence capabilities.\n\nNew Regulations Aimed at Strengthening Cybersecurity\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has created a set of voluntary Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPG) in cooperation with the Healthcare and Public Health (HPH) sector to encourage the implementation of high-impact cybersecurity practices to help organizations better prepare for and mitigate cyberthreats. The CPGs are designed to defend against the most common tactics used by cyber adversaries to attack health care and related third parties, such as exploitation of known technical vulnerabilities, phishing emails and stolen credentials. The AHA helped draft these CPGs and we have strongly advocated that they must apply to third-party technology providers and business associates as well.

        "text": "Election certification is a traditionally routine duty that has become politicized in the Trump era\nFor the outcome of this year\u2019s presidential race, it will be the vote count on election night and possibly in the days after that will grab the public\u2019s attention. But those numbers are unofficial until the election is formally certified \u2014 a once uneventful process that has become politicized since then-President Donald Trump tried to overturn his reelection loss four years ago.\n\nTrump unsuccessfully pressured fellow Republicans on an evenly divided board that had to sign off on Michigan\u2019s vote not to certify his loss in the state. On Jan. 6, 2021, he directed his supporters to march to the Capitol and stop Congress from taking the final step to certify that Democrat Joe Biden had won the presidency.\n\nThis year, Trump\u2019s allies have set the table to try to block certification should Trump lose to Democrat Kamala Harris.\n\nThe best way to think about certification is as a three-step process.\n\nIt starts with local governments, such as counties. It then moves to states, which add up all the local totals to certify the winner and appoint presidential electors. Congress then effectively certifies the votes of those electors.\n\nThe process may seem daunting, especially on the local level. Most of the country\u2019s thousands of individual election jurisdictions \u2014 many of which have been taken over by Trump supporters \u2014 have to officially certify their vote tallies before a state can certify a winner. If just one of those counties refuses to certify, it could stop a state from signing off.\n\nWhat to know about Trump\u2019s second term:\n\nStaffing the administration: Here are the people Trump has picked recess appointments Follow all of our coverage as Donald Trump assembles his second administration.\n\nLegal experts say there is no actual legal risk of Trump\u2019s allies being able to reverse a loss by refusing to certify at the local level. Decades of case law hold that local officials have no choice but to certify election results. Any potential problem with the vote count can be challenged in court, but not on the boards and commissions that have the ceremonial task of certifying the ballot tallies and transmitting them to the state.\n\nTrump supporters have tried to block election results in Arizona, Michigan and New Mexico since 2020 by refusing to certify them, only to be forced to sign off by courts or to back down under legal pressure.\n\nThe notion that a lone board could hold up a state by refusing to certify is \u201cthis crazy fantasy that has merged the right and the left,\u201d said Derek Muller, a University of Notre Dame law professor.\n\nIn 2020, Trump focused intensely on getting Republican state leaders to refuse to certify his losses and send his own slate of electors to the Electoral College. That failed everywhere.\n\nIn 2024, four of the six swing states where Trump disputed his loss are led by Democratic governors. In the other two, the GOP governors don\u2019t seem likely to go along with a potential push by Trump to stop certification. Georgia\u2019s Brian Kemp defied Trump in 2020, and Nevada\u2019s Joe Lombardo was elected in 2022 with votes from Democrats.\n\nThe last step in the certification process is in Congress on Jan. 6. Once the states have certified their winners and selected their electors, and those electors cast their votes for president, the Constitution requires Congress to formally count those votes.\n\nThat\u2019s what Trump and his supporters seized on in 2020, arguing that Congress could choose to reject Electoral College votes from states where it didn\u2019t trust the vote count. Even after the assault on the Capitol, a majority of House Republicans \u2014 139 of them \u2014 and eight Republican senators voted to reject Biden\u2019s electors from Pennsylvania. That wasn\u2019t enough votes to change the outcome of the election, but it\u2019s a signal that they could try again should Harris win.\n\nA bipartisan majority in Congress not only upheld Biden\u2019s 2020 victory but then amended the law that governs how Congress certifies a presidential election to make it much harder to reject Electoral College votes. If Harris wins, we\u2019ll see if that majority still holds on Jan. 6 to confirm her victory.\n\n____\n\nRead more about how U.S. elections work at Explaining Election 2024, a series from The Associated Press aimed at helping make sense of the American democracy.

        "text": "Trump vs Harris: where they stand on immigration\nImmigration has emerged as one of the most critical issues for voters in the November 2024 US presidential elections. It is the third most important issue to voters after the economy and protecting democracy. The shifts in attitude came after irregular migration reached historic levels before President Biden issued an executive order in June 2024 that has contributed to three consecutive months of decreases in border crossings. The two presidential candidates, former President Donald Trump (a Republican) and Vice President Kamala Harris (a Democrat), disagree on most immigration policies and employ vastly different rhetoric to discuss the issue.\n\nAs president, Trump implemented sweeping policies to combat irregular immigration and reduce legal immigration, using the vast powers of the federal government, including diplomatic pressure and coercion, to pursue this agenda. If re-elected in 2024, he has promised to \u2018terminate every open border policy of the Biden Administration\u2019. He has also vowed to \u2018restore all of his prior policies\u2019 and take additional steps, some of which would likely push the outward limits of US law.\n\nOne of the most cited actions Trump says he would take on his first day in the White House is to \u2018begin the largest deportation operation in American history\u2019. Trump\u2019s campaign said he would \u2018marshal every federal and state power necessary\u2019 for the purpose. While the president has the legal authority to pursue increased deportations, an initiative of the scale proposed would face significant logistical, resource and diplomatic challenges. Depending on how it is implemented, it could also face litigation. Research shows that such a mass deportation would have a significant economic impact, causing disruption in some industries, reducing tax revenues and reigniting inflation. Moreover, images or videos of US agents knocking on doors and arresting families with young children, senior citizens or long-time residents with no criminal record would likely result in a public outcry.\n\nTrump says he would take on his first day in the White House is to \u2018begin the largest deportation operation in American history\u2019. Trump\u2019s campaign said he would \u2018marshal every federal and state power necessary\u2019 for the purpose.\n\nIn his 2016 campaign, Trump focused extensively on his promise to build a wall across the US-Mexico border. In his 2024 campaign he has focused more on reinstituting his border and asylum policies. At a campaign event, Trump did not rule out reviving Zero Tolerance, one of his most controversial immigration policies. Pursuant to this 2018 policy, immigrant families who crossed the US-Mexico border were separated; children were placed in US custody and reunified with other family members, while parents were criminally charged and deported. He said, \u2018I know it sounds harsh. When you say to [a] family if you come, we\u2019re going to break you up, they don\u2019t come. And we can\u2019t afford to have any more.\u2019 Trump bowed to domestic and international pressure and abandoned the programme within just three months of its operation. Implementing the programme again would likely cause the same negative public reaction as in 2018. It would also subject families to unnecessary pain and trauma. Of the 4,656 children separated from their parents due to Zero Tolerance, 1,360 have still not been reunited.\n\nTrump has also said he would reinstitute three other controversial programmes that would make it more difficult for asylum-seekers crossing the US-Mexico border to access protection in the US. One is the Migrant Protection Protocols, a programme negotiated with Mexico that allowed the US to return certain immigrants to Mexico while they awaited the resolution of their US immigration proceedings. Another is the Asylum Cooperation Agreement, an initiative the US negotiated with El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras to transfer certain asylum-seekers to these countries to allow them to pursue their protection claims there. Lastly, he and his advisors have said he would invoke Title 42, a public health authority that allows the US government to expel immigrants immediately in the name of public health. In 2020 his justification was the COVID-19 pandemic. To justify his approach this time he has laid the groundwork, claiming that immigrants are bringing tuberculosis and other contagious diseases into the country. These programmes will be criticised by civil society organisations, some members of Congress and international organisations, just as they were when first implemented, for putting immigrants in danger and denying them access to the US asylum system. They would also certainly face litigation.\n\nTrump has also promised to restore his \u2018travel ban on entry from terror-plagued countries\u2019. As president, one of his first actions in 2017 was to ban travellers from certain majority-Muslim countries from entering the US. Trump has promised to bring back the travel ban \u2018even bigger than before and much stronger than before\u2019. The programme will likely survive legal attempts to block it as advisors have a successful roadmap from Trump\u2019s first Administration. The more significant issue is the programme\u2019s effectiveness and impact. There is no evidence that nationality-based travel-ban programmes are effective. Moreover, its implementation would likely undermine the government\u2019s ability to sustain or improve cooperation and information sharing with key countries in the fight against terrorism, as well as hurt US credibility in the world, as it would appear to be a policy designed to discriminate against Muslims.\n\nTrump has also said that he wants to end birthright citizenship for children born in the US to undocumented immigrant parents. He said he would sign an executive order on his first day in office to withhold passports, Social Security numbers and other government benefits from such children. The overwhelming legal consensus is that the 14th Amendment provides this right to immigrants. Therefore, to revoke it, either the Supreme Court would need to rule in Trump\u2019s favour, or he would need to pursue a Constitutional amendment, which requires Congress to propose a measure and three-quarter of US states to ratify it. However, polling shows that only 46% of Republicans and 30% of Democrats back the measure, making it highly unlikely for it to be adopted as a constitutional amendment.\n\nHarris has a lengthy public record given her time as a District Attorney in California, Attorney General of California, Senator, presidential candidate in the 2020 election and Vice President; however, during her 2024 presidential campaign, she has sought to distance herself from some of her prior, more liberal positions before her time as vice president. Instead, she has primarily backed President Biden\u2019s policies while adjusting the message.\n\nWhen Harris entered the race in July, Biden trailed Trump by 35 points on securing the border and controlling immigration. This is likely why she has provided few details on her immigration views and campaigned as a more solutions-oriented, centrist candidate. Since then, she has improved but still trails Trump by 21 points.\n\nDuring the September presidential debate, Harris emphasised her experience as Attorney General of California prosecuting cross-border crimes, such as drug trafficking and human trafficking, to distinguish herself from Trump. She also vowed to sign into law a proposal that a bipartisan group of Senators released in early 2024 before it failed due to Republican opposition. The bill would authorise hiring thousands more border patrol agents and asylum officers, allow the president to close the border if irregular border crossings reach a certain threshold, and raise the standard for being able to claim asylum, amongst other provisions. Harris has criticised Trump for urging Republican members of Congress to oppose the bill because he did not want to give Biden a victory on immigration during an election year.\n\nIf elected, she would likely continue to support US government efforts that she has been leading as vice president to increase public and private investments in Central America to address the root causes of migration. She would also likely continue the government\u2019s work to create and expand legal avenues for immigration, such as refugee resettlement, work visas and parole, to reduce pressure on the US-Mexico border. She would also be expected to pursue enhanced migration management cooperation with other countries in the hemisphere by encouraging the other 21 signatories to implement the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection. Individually, none of these programmes or initiatives would be expected to reduce or alter migration flows immediately or significantly. However, when coupled with other policies, they serve as the building blocks for creating a more enduring migration management system that promotes safe, legal and orderly migration.\n\nDespite the many differences between the two candidates, they agree on the need to strengthen border security and reform the asylum system. Trump has long held these views, while Harris and many Democrats have only recently adopted more hawkish positions consistent with public opinion. A recent poll revealed that 55% of adults support reduced immigration to the US, the highest total since the aftermath of the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks. Moreover, if polling continues to show strong support for border and asylum reforms in 2025, it could serve as an impetus for the two parties to come together and pass meaningful immigration reform legislation, something Congress has not accomplished in nearly 40 years.",

        "text": "Election 2024: New Policy Brief from AU\u2019s Institute for Macroeconomic and Policy Analysis\nVoters face contrasting choices when it comes to funding the federal government, driving economic growth, and driving down income inequality, according to a new policy brief on the presidential candidates\u2019 corporate tax proposals from American University\u2019s Institute for Macroeconomic and Policy Analysis.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris proposes a hike in the corporate tax rate to 28 percent, up from 21 percent, a move IMPA projects will stimulate private investment and increase GDP. It projects a boost to federal revenue \u2014 2.4 percent annually after 10 years. In contrast, former President Donald Trump's plan aims to cut the corporate tax rate to 15 percent. IMPA\u2019s analysis suggests that this reduction would lead to a slight contraction in GDP and federal revenue.\n\nAdditionally, the Harris proposal, with its focus on raising tax rates on corporations and the wealthiest households, would decrease income inequality, IMPA finds. Under her proposal, IMPA projects a 4.7 percent increase in the share of all income going to the bottom 50 percent of wage earners. Conversely, Trump's proposed tax cut would reduce their share of national income by almost 5 percent.\n\n\n\nIMPA's model reflects a growing body of academic research bringing to light the extent of market power in the economy. IMPA examines how the corporate tax primarily affects corporate profits. Because much of the cost of investment is deductible, the corporate tax is really a tax on extra profits that businesses make when they have market power. When corporate taxes are low, firms with extensive market power can give bigger payouts to their shareholders compared to smaller companies. This makes it more expensive for other companies to invest, which can dampen overall investment in the economy.\n\n\n\nAccording to the brief\u2019s authors, Harris\u2019s plan to raise the corporate tax rate will \u201c[help] eliminate inefficiencies associated with market power. In contrast, by lowering the corporate tax to 15%, the Trump proposal would increase the return on excess profits, accentuating market power distortions and discouraging productive private investment.\u201d",

Just 3% of voters remain undecided a month before Election Day.In the state\u2019s Senate race, Democratic incumbent Elizabeth Warren is easily outpacing Republican nominee John Deaton 59%-35%, with 6% of voters still undecided. At 60%, Warren\u2019s job approval tops every other major candidate among voters polled, including Governor Maura Healey (58%), Kamala Harris (57%), Joe Biden (56%), and Donald Trump (35%).Of the five ballot questions voter will face, 71% of Massachusetts voters said they would vote to grant the state auditor the authority to audit the legislature, while just 16% opposed the measure.The second question would eliminate the MCAS examination as a high school graduation requirement, and when asked if they supported this measure, 58% responded \u201cyes,\u201d and 37% responded \u201cno.\u201dQuestion 3, which would provide unionization for transportation network drivers, received support from 59% of voters, with 34% saying \u201cno.\u201dVoters were nearly equally split on the fourth question, to legalize certain natural psychedelic substances, with 47% \u201cyes\u201d and 46% \u201cno.\u201d Another high-profile ballot referendum, Question 5, which seeks to raise the minimum wage for tipped workers and allow employers to pool tips for nonmanagement workers, was narrowly opposed by those surveyed, 52%-40%.The Suffolk University and The Boston Globe statewide survey of 500 residents was conducted October 2-6, and is based on live interviews of registered voters in Massachusetts who indicated they were very or somewhat likely to vote this November. Each area\u2019s quota and demographic information\u2014including party affiliation, gender, race, and age\u2014were determined from presidential exit polls and 2022 census data. The 14 Massachusetts counties were grouped into four general regions. The margin of sampling error for results based on the total sample is +/- 4.4 percentage points. Suffolk University student Zoe Toperosky contributed to the poll summaries for this survey.

        "summary": " New research confirms growing impact of abortion on US elections with new research . Abortion has increasingly become a decisive policy issue that helps determine presidential elections in the US . Previous research showed that abortion was a less significant issue in the presidential elections of the 1970s and 1980s .",
        "text": "Transforming Society ~ New research confirms growing impact of abortion on US elections\nThe news that abortion has increasingly become a decisive policy issue that helps determine presidential elections in the US is now backed up by research.\n\n\u2019The electoral consequences of abortion politicization in the US\u2019, published in the European Journal of Politics and Gender, is based on data from the American National Election Studies (ANES), and sheds light on how the politicisation of the abortion issue affected US presidential elections between 1980 and 2020. And yes, the empirical verdict is that attitudes toward abortion have increasingly become a central factor in voters\u2019 choice between Democrats and Republicans.\n\nPrevious research showed that abortion was a less significant issue in the presidential elections of the 1970s and 1980s. In 1980, around 36 per cent of Americans unconditionally supported free abortion. This number rose to about 46 per cent in the early 1990s, dropped to 37 per cent in the 2000s, and rose again to 48 per cent in 2020. Thus, nearly half of Americans in 2020 unconditionally supported free abortion, which is historically high for the period in which abortion opinions have been measured. Support for free abortion has therefore been increasing in the US in recent decades.\n\nBut what does this mean for voting behaviour in presidential elections? One of my key findings is that there is a negative correlation between pro-abortion views and the likelihood of voting for a Republican presidential candidate. Conversely, voters with pro-abortion views are positively correlated with voting Democrat.\n\nIn 1980, pro-abortion views were weakly negatively correlated with voting Republican. By 2020, that correlation had become nearly four times stronger. However, the development has not been linear. Empirically, one can see that the significance of the abortion issue comes in jumps, coinciding with Supreme Court rulings and changes in the composition of the Supreme Court.\n\nThere was a significant jump in the importance of the abortion issue for voter behaviour between the 1980s and 1990s. One of the most notable shifts came in 1992, after the Supreme Court ruling in the case Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which made the abortion issue much more politicised.\n\nAnother striking jump came between the 2016 and 2020 elections after Donald Trump appointed several conservative judges to the Supreme Court. These appointments solidified a conservative majority, which has since put free abortion under pressure.\n\nThe keen reader will immediately ask whether conditional attitudes toward abortion also matter. And they do, at least to some extent. Empirically, I find that voters with moderate views on abortion, such as those who only support abortion in certain cases, have a higher predicted likelihood of switching their support from Republicans to Democrats. But the probabilities are not large. This group of voters constitutes an important voter base, and the increased politicisation of the abortion issue could potentially give Democrats an advantage, especially if they manage to appeal to these more moderate voters.\n\nWe should emphasise that all these findings are correlations and not causal effects. At the same time, it should also be stressed that I do not show whether changes in abortion laws and Supreme Court judges actually matter. It is merely an assumption based on notable coincidences. But to the extent that it is the case, the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization from 2022 will only further cement the significance of the abortion issue in American politics.\n\nThe abortion issue is no longer a peripheral topic but a central part of American voters\u2019 considerations when choosing a president. This is especially relevant in connection with the upcoming 2024 presidential election, where the issue of abortion rights could be decisive for the election\u2019s outcome. How important it will be, we will only know after 5 November.\n\nS\u00f8ren Frank Etzerodt is a PhD student at the Technical University of Munich. He has published work on the political economy of welfare states and on voting.\n\nThe electoral consequences of abortion politicization in the US by S\u00f8ren Frank Etzerodt is available to read in the European Journal of Politics and Gender on Bristol University Press Digital here.\n\nBristol University Press/Policy Press newsletter subscribers receive a 25% discount on our books \u2013 sign up here.\n\nFollow Transforming Society so we can let you know when new articles publish.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed on this blog site are solely those of the original blog post authors and other contributors.

It is the only issue on which a majority of voters, 52%, say the candidates\u2019 positions on it are an \u201cextremely important\u201d influence on their vote. Another 38% of voters rate the economy as \u201cvery important,\u201d which means the issue could be a significant factor to nine in 10 voters.\n\nVoters view Donald Trump as better able than Kamala Harris to handle the economy, 54% versus 45%. Trump also has an edge on perceptions of his handling of immigration (+9 percentage points) and foreign affairs (+5), while Harris is seen as better on climate change (+26), abortion (+16) and healthcare (+10). The candidates are evenly matched on voters\u2019 impressions of who would better address gun policy.\n\nJust under half of voters overall agree with Trump (49%) or Harris (47%) on the issues that matter most to them.\n\nThese findings are from a Gallup poll conducted Sept. 16-28.\n\nImportance of Economy Highest Since Great Recession\n\nThe current 52% of voters rating the economy as an \u201cextremely important\u201d influence on their vote for president is the highest since October 2008 during the Great Recession, when 55% of voters said the same. In polls conducted closest to the election in other presidential election years since 1996, between 38% and 44% of voters rated candidates\u2019 positions on the economy as extremely important to their vote. Half of these readings are from September or October polling; the exceptions are 2000 (August), 2012 (February) and 2016 (May).\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nDemocracy, National Security, Supreme Court Justice Picks Highest After Economy\n\nBesides the economy, no other issue receives an \u201cextremely important\u201d rating from most voters; however, majorities consider most issues as \"extremely\" or \"very important.\" Just two issues -- climate change (50%) and transgender rights (38%) -- are viewed by less than a majority of voters as extremely or very important to their presidential vote choice.\n\nBetween 41% and 49% of voters say four issues are extremely important to their vote -- democracy in the U.S., terrorism and national security, the types of Supreme Court justices the candidates would pick if they became president, and immigration. Ten issues are rated as extremely important by 31% to 38% of voters, including education, healthcare, gun policy, abortion, taxes, crime, the distribution of income and wealth in the U.S., the federal budget deficit, foreign affairs, and the situation in the Middle East between the Israelis and Palestinians.\n\nFewer voters, 23% to 27%, consider five issues as extremely important to their vote choice -- energy policy, relations with Russia, race relations, relations with China and trade with other nations. Twenty-one percent of voters say climate change and 18% say transgender rights are of the utmost importance to their vote.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nPartisans\u2019 Views of the Importance of Most Issues Diverge Significantly\n\nWhereas 66% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independent voters rate the economy as extremely important to their presidential votes, far fewer Democratic and Democratic-leaning independent voters do (36%). The combined extremely/very important reading for the economy is 98% among Republican/Republican-leaning voters and 82% among Democratic/Democratic-leaning voters.\n\nThe economy is the top-ranked issue for Republican voters, but it is not among Democratic voters\u2019 top five issues. In fact, there is no overlap between Republican and Democratic voters in the top five issues ranked as extremely important to their votes. For Democrats, democracy in the U.S., the types of Supreme Court justices the candidates would pick, abortion, healthcare and education are the five most important voting issues. Immigration, terrorism and national security, crime, and taxes round out Republican voters\u2019 five top issues.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nThe current partisan divide on rating the economy extremely important is in marked contrast to 2008, when it was the top-scoring issue for both parties.\n\nVoters differ significantly by party on the importance of most issues measured. The greatest difference is for immigration (40 points). The next-largest divergences among partisan voters are 29- to 32-point differences for five issues -- crime, climate change, the economy, the federal budget deficit and terrorism/national security.\n\nRepublican and Democratic voters rate three issues as similarly important -- education, relations with Russia, and gun policy.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nTrump Favored to Handle Economy, Immigration, Foreign Affairs\n\nSlim majorities of U.S. voters think Trump would do a better job than Harris when it comes to handling the economy (54%), immigration (54%) and foreign affairs (52%). At the same time, majorities of voters favor Harris over Trump to handle climate change (61%), abortion (56%) and healthcare (54%). Voters are evenly divided on which candidate would better deal with gun policy.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nAs would be expected, Republican and Democratic voters broadly favor their own party\u2019s candidate to handle each of the issues. Majorities of Democratic voters, ranging from 88% to 97%, think Harris would be better on all seven issues.\n\nThere is more variation among Republicans for Trump\u2019s ability to handle issues, ranging from highs of 97% on immigration and the economy to lows of 69% on climate change and 78% on abortion. One-quarter of Republican voters think Harris would be better on climate change and 16% say the same about abortion. No more than 11% of Democratic voters think Trump would be better than Harris on any of the issues.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nVoters Split on Which Candidate They Agree With on Issues That Matter Most\n\nVoters are evenly divided over whether they agree (49%) or disagree (50%) with Trump on the issues that matter most to them. They express similar levels of agreement with Harris\u2019 stances on the issues they value most, as 47% say they agree with her, while 52% disagree.\n\nVoters in both parties overwhelmingly say they agree with their party\u2019s candidate on the issues that matter most to them -- 95% of Republican voters agree with Trump, and 92% agree with Harris.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nHarris fares better than Joe Biden did in June, when 37% of U.S. voters said they agreed with him on the issues that matter most to them. Trump\u2019s readings are essentially unchanged since June.\n\nBottom Line\n\nEconomic confidence in the U.S. has been persistently low this year, which is reflected in U.S. voters rating the economy as the most important issue impacting their choice for president. While the economy often ranks as one of the top voting issues in presidential elections, this year it may be more influential than in any election since 2008 during the Great Recession. Trump is favored over Harris to better handle the issue, giving him a significant advantage in the election, though this is partly influenced by Republicans being more likely than Democrats to rate the economy as an extremely important issue.\n\nPartisans differ sharply in their views of the most important vote issues this year, with no common issues among each group\u2019s top five.\n\nTo stay up to date with the latest Gallup News insights and updates, follow us on X @Gallup.\n\nLearn more about how the Gallup Poll Social Series works.\n\nView complete question responses and trends (PDF download).\n\n###Embeddable###",

Garland. \u201cWe will continue to combat the ongoing threat that ISIS and its supporters pose to America\u2019s national security, and we will identify, investigate, and prosecute the individuals who seek to terrorize the American people. I am deeply grateful to the public servants of the FBI, National Security Division, and U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Western District of Oklahoma for their work to disrupt this attack and for the work they do every day to protect our country.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis defendant, motivated by ISIS, allegedly conspired to commit a violent attack, on Election Day, here on our homeland,\" said FBI Director Christopher Wray. \"I am proud of the men and women of the FBI who uncovered and stopped the plot before anyone was harmed. Terrorism is still the FBI's number one priority, and we will use every resource to protect the American people.\"\n\n\u201cThanks to the relentless efforts of the FBI, National Security Division\u2019s Counterterrorism Section, and federal prosecutors in my office, the alleged plan to commit an attack on Election Day was disrupted and Mr. Tawhedi was arrested,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Robert J. Troester for the Western District of Oklahoma. \u201cFighting terrorism remains the top priority of the Justice Department. We will continue to pursue, disrupt, and hold accountable those who plot to commit acts of terrorism against our country and our people.\u201d\n\nAccording to the criminal complaint, as part of the investigation into Tawhedi, the FBI searched Tawhedi\u2019s phone and obtained communications between Tawhedi and a person who facilitated recruitment, training, and indoctrination of persons who expressed interest in terrorist activity and who Tawhedi understood to be affiliated with ISIS. Tawhedi was also seen in a video recorded on July 20 reading to two children text that describes the rewards a martyr receives in the afterlife. Tawhedi also allegedly accessed, viewed, and saved ISIS propaganda on his iCloud and Google account, participated in pro-ISIS Telegram groups, and contributed to a charity which fronts for and funnels money to ISIS.\n\nThe complaint alleges that while liquidating their family\u2019s assets prior to the attack, Tawhedi and his co-conspirator, who is a juvenile, advertised the sale of the family\u2019s personal property on Facebook. At the FBI\u2019s direction, a confidential human source responded to inquire if a computer was still for sale. The FBI source noted that he needed the computer for a new gun business he was starting, which ultimately led Tawhedi and the juvenile to meet with the source and other FBI assets at a rural location to test firearms. Tawhedi expressed interest in purchasing two AK-47 assault rifles, magazines, and ammunition from the source.\n\nAccording to the criminal complaint, on Oct. 7, Tawhedi and the juvenile met with the FBI assets at a rural location in the Western District of Oklahoma and purchased, received, and took possession of two AK-47 assault rifles, ten magazines, and 500 rounds of ammunition. Upon receipt of the rifles and ammunition, Tawhedi and the juvenile were arrested.\n\nIn his seized communications, Tawhedi allegedly indicated that his attack was planned for Election Day, and in a post-arrest interview, Tawhedi allegedly confirmed the attack was planned for Election Day targeting large gatherings of people, during which he and the juvenile were expected to die as martyrs.\n\nTawhedi was charged with conspiring and attempting to provide material support to ISIS, which carries a maximum prison sentence of 20 years, and receiving a firearm to be used to commit a felony or a federal crime of terrorism, which carries a maximum prison sentence of 15 years, if convicted.\n\nThe case is being investigated by the FBI Oklahoma City Field Office, with valuable assistance from the Oklahoma City Police Department and the Moore, Oklahoma Police Department.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorneys Jessica L. Perry, Matt Dillon, and Mark Stoneman for the Western District of Oklahoma and Trial Attorneys George C. Kraehe and Everett McMillian of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterterrorism Section are prosecuting the case.\n\nA criminal complaint is merely an allegation. All defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.",

        "text": "UConn Scholars Consider \u2018Historic Firsts\u2019 of 2024 Election\nIt\u2019s rare that any particular event can be confidently predicted to be of major historical significance before it happens, but American presidential elections definitely fit the bill. And while all presidential elections are momentous, each one has unique dynamics and characteristics that influence history in very different ways.\n\nIt was with this in mind that three UConn scholars gathered at the Old State House in Hartford on Tuesday, Oct. 8, to analyze the current presidential contest in terms of historical significance \u2013 and what makes this election distinct.\n\nOne of the most striking differences between this election and every previous presidential campaign is that a major party nominee \u2013 Vice President Kamala Harris \u2013 is a woman of color. Even more remarkable, the scholars said, is the way she came to win the Democratic Party\u2019s nomination \u2013 being endorsed by President Joe Biden after his unprecedented decision to drop out of the race just weeks before the party\u2019s nominating convention in August.\n\n\u201cWhat I will never forget, especially as a political scientist, is the way she came to be the Democratic nominee,\u201d said Evelyn Simien, professor of Political Science, Director of the Africana Studies Institute, and author of \u201cHistoric Firsts: How Symbolic Empowerment Changes U.S. Politics (Oxford University Press, 2016).\u201d\n\nManisha Sinha, the James L. and Shirley A. Draper Chair in American History and author of \u201cThe Slave\u2019s Cause: A History of Abolition (Yale University Press, 2017)\u201d and \u201cThe Rise and Fall of the Second American Republic: Reconstruction, 1860-1920 (Liveright, 2024),\u201d agreed that the circumstances of Harris\u2019 nomination make the 2024 election unique.\n\n\u201cThis is probably one of the first times we\u2019ve had a presidential nominee so late in the game who has been able to step up so quickly,\u201d she said.\n\nAnother distinctive factor of this election, argued Christopher Vials, professor of English and author of \u201cHaunted by Hitler: Liberals, the Left, and the Fight Against Fascism in the United States (University of Massachusetts Press, 2014),\u201d is that \u201cnew taboos continue to be broken\u201d in political rhetoric surrounding the race.\n\nPointing to an interview the pundit Tucker Carlson conducted in September with a far-right podcaster notorious for defending the Third Reich and blaming Winston Churchill for World War II, Vials said, \u201cTucker Carlson is nodding his head, and then Elon Musk tweets about how that was a fabulous interview. They\u2019re sort of breaking the Hitler taboo now.\u201d\n\nOne concern all three scholars shared was the possibility of low voter turnout, especially in states like Connecticut, where the presidential race is not expected to be competitive.\n\n\u201cA lot of people become a little blas\u00e9 about elections; they think noting changes, they think their vote doesn\u2019t count, and that can open the door to authoritarian outcomes in elections,\u201d Sinha said.\n\nSimien said she reminds her students that the right to vote has only, in historical terms, recently been won by all Americans regardless of race or gender, and shouldn\u2019t be taken for granted.\n\n\u201cYounger voters owe a debt to older generations, people who have sacrificed life and limb so that we can have the right to cast a vote in American elections,\u201d she said.\n\nVials noted the importance of elections for state and local offices, pointing out that decisions made in city hall or Hartford often have immediate, direct consequences in daily life.\n\n\u201cState elections affect your lives a lot; they determine whether social services are going to be provided, whether universities are going to be funded, tax rates, who gets taxed \u2013 those are things that affect people\u2019s lives every day, apart from the federal election,\u201d he said.\n\nConnecticut residents will be able to vote early for the first time this year: balloting begins on October 21 and runs for 14 days.\n\nThe forum at the Old State House was sponsored by the UConn Department of Social and Critical Inquiry, Department of English, Africana Studies Institute, Department of History, and Department of Political Science.\n\nA video recording of the discussion can be viewed on YouTube.",

The series aims to explore various viewpoints and aspects of an election and engage TCU\u2019s diverse community in voting as informed, responsible citizens.\n\nThe third event in the series, \u201cBetween \u2018Not Perfect\u2019 and \u2018Excellent\u2019: Evaluating American Elections with Jim Riddlesperger\u201d will feature the professor of political science as he delves into decisions that have made fair elections difficult. Ahead of the event, Riddlesperger answered a few questions on the topic at hand for TCU News.\n\nThe title of the event says that our elections are somewhere between \u201cnot perfect\u201d and \u201cexcellent.\u201d Can you expand on this idea?\n\nWe all know the difficulties associated with presidential elections. Just to name three: (1) The Electoral College makes it where only the votes in seven swing states will determine the outcome of the election, rendering voters in 43 states feeling like their vote is discounted. And, of course, there is always the possibility that the candidate who wins the popular vote can lose in the Electoral College. (2) Republicans, of course, think that there are states in the country with policies that allow people to vote who are not properly registered. Though the evidence for this is not strong, a huge number of voters think this is a problem. (3) Democrats believe that the Republicans are intentionally excluding eligible voters from participating with restrictive voting laws, and that this alleged suppression might affect the outcome of the election. So, in a nation that prides itself on free and fair (excellent) elections, we have issues that render the system \u201cnot perfect.\u201d\n\nWhat changes in the political system over the years have contributed to what we\u2019re seeing now?\n\nThere are many, many changes in the election system over time. This is very difficult to summarize because each of the 50 states can change its primary and general election rules for each election. There are literally dozens of changes in the law each election: building and maintaining election rolls, the logistics of elections, identification necessary to vote, the machines used to collect and count votes and even how electoral votes will be cast (see the pressure last week for Nebraska to change how it was to cast electoral votes as an example). This is a complex and ongoing issue. The key here, in my opinion, is that under the United States Constitution, states make decisions about how to conduct elections. With Washington included, that means there are literally 51 sets of rules used across the country.\n\nWhat pending evolutions do you see today that you think have the potential to change elections years from now when we look back?\n\nI really fear that this year, if the election is close, there will be huge segments of voters who might not accept the outcome of the election. That is the evolution that is most profound. We had contested elections in 1800, 1824, 1876 and 1888, so this is not an entirely new issue, but with two elections in this century where the popular vote went for Democrats and the Electoral College for Republicans (2000 and 2016), Democrats feel the system itself is stacked against them, and with former President Donald Trump not having accepted the outcome of the 2020 election, the potential for disruption after the election is large. That could be a warning sign for the peaceful transition of power that characterized our nation through nearly all of its history.\n\nWhat is the best thing we can do as citizens and voters?\n\nVOTE. And be engaged as citizens. That is the guardrail of democracy.\n\nBetween \u201cNot Perfect\u201d and \u201cExcellent\u201d: Evaluating American Elections with Jim Riddlesperger will be held Oct. 15.\n\nFor more on Elections, Democracy and Social Values, read Betting on Democracy: Grant Ferguson Discusses Political Predictive Markets and Information, Misinformation and Disinformation: Kristie Bunton on Elections, AI.",

How is AP making sure readers have accurate, nonpartisan information about the election?\n\nArtificial intelligence is playing an influential role in the 2024 political cycle, even if the greatest fears about how it could threaten the U.S. presidential election haven\u2019t materialized on a broad scale. Throughout the year, AP has offered a mix of stories from investigative reports into how presidential campaigns are using AI models to reach voters to daily coverage of audio deepfakes that are spreading AI-generated disinformation. The use of AI for political satire and propaganda isn\u2019t limited to the U.S. and has been observed in elections from Indonesia to the Netherlands. More sinister deepfakes also have sought to influence races around the world.\n\nBecause the use of AI models in the political sphere affects voters of all persuasions, AP has distinguished its coverage of the technology\u2019s impacts on the 2024 race through robust daily coverage, explanatory pieces and an investigative series called \u201cThe AI Campaign.\u201d AP also has offered online and in-person trainings for reporters and editors on how to cover AI, highlighting opportunities for election coverage.\n\nA person attaches a \u201cI Voted\u201d sticker to their shirt on the first day of early voting for the 2024 Presidential General Election, Oct. 3, 2024, in Chicago. (AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast)\n\nHow does AP spot AI-generated misinformation and what do we do about it?\n\nThe speed and accessibility of generative AI tools make it easy to create outlandish political content that can drive clicks and likes. With AI image generators accessible to anyone with an internet connection, they are a cheap and convenient way for campaigns to respond to online trends and hammer home a message from local races to the presidential contest. AP is monitoring social media and campaign websites for eye-catching AI-generated photos, audio and videos that spread false messages that mislead our audiences. Our teams publish regularly on what we find to provide our audiences with the latest nonpartisan, fact-based information.\n\nWhat will we be watching for on election night?\n\nOn election night, our journalists will be watching for instances in which candidates, campaigns or third parties may use AI to misinform the public about electoral processes, voter access and election results. Our reporters covering politics, democracy, misinformation and other issues will ensure that our audiences receive accurate information about the U.S. election that places AI in the appropriate context.",

        "summary": " Democratic vice-presidential nominee Tim Walz calls for scrapping of electoral college to decide US presidential race . Walz's comments risk destabilising the campaign of Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate, who has not adopted a position on the matter .",
        "text": "Tim Walz calls for scrapping of electoral college to decide US presidential race\nTim Walz, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, has called for the electoral college system of electing US presidents to be abolished and replaced with a popular vote principle, as operates in most democracies.\n\nHis comments \u2013 to an audience of party fundraisers \u2013 chime with the sentiments of a majority of American voters but risk destabilising the campaign of Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate, who has not adopted a position on the matter, despite having previously voiced similar views.\n\n\u201cI think all of us know, the electoral college needs to go,\u201d Walz told donors at a gathering at the home of the California governor, Gavin Newsom. \u201cWe need a national popular vote. We need to be able to go into York, Pennsylvania, and win. We need to be in western Wisconsin and win. We need to be in Reno, Nevada, and win.\u201d\n\nHe had earlier made similar remarks at a separate event in Seattle, where he called himself \u201ca national popular vote guy\u201d, while qualifying it by saying, \u201cthat\u2019s not the world we live in.\u201d\n\nThe statements refer to the apparent democratic anomaly whereby US presidential polls are decided not by who wins the most votes nationwide but instead by which candidate captures a majority of 538 electoral votes across the 50 states, plus Washington DC.\n\nThe votes are distributed broadly reflective of each state\u2019s population size, so populous California, for example, has 54 electoral college votes, while tiny Rhode Island has just four. However, rare cases of US presidents winning the electoral college while losing the popular vote tally do happen, notably in recent times George W Bush in 2000 and Donald Trump in 2016.\n\nThe concerns over the electoral college system crystallise the reality that next month\u2019s contest between Harris and Trump, the Republican nominee, will come down to the outcomes in a small number of battleground states, where polls show them running neck-and-neck.\n\nMost surveys indicate Harris having a small but consistent nationwide lead. Yet even if these are borne out on polling day, Trump could still return to the White House by winning enough swing states to reach the 270 electoral votes needed.\n\nThat scenario is feared by Democrats since it would repeat the outcome of the 2016 election, when Trump beat Hillary Clinton thanks to the electoral college despite winning nearly 3m fewer votes across the nation.\n\nWalz\u2019s comments are eye-catching because he was chosen as Harris\u2019s running mate because his homely, plain-speaking style was judged as appealing to working-class voters in three of the most important battleground states, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.\n\nIt is not the first time that Walz, the Minnesota governor, has advocated ditching the electoral college.\n\nLast year, he signed legislation that added Minnesota to the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, which would force states to award their electors to the national popular vote winner if enough of them agreed to do so.\n\nIn the absence of that, only a constitutional amendment could alter the current electoral system.\n\nHarris-Walz campaign officials stressed that abolishing the electoral college was not part of its agenda.\n\n\u201cGovernor Walz believes that every vote matters in the electoral college and he is honored to be traveling the country and battleground states working to earn support for the Harris-Walz ticket,\u201d Teddy Tschann, a spokesman for Walz, told the New York Times.\n\nThe comments were seized on gleefully by Trump\u2019s campaign, which is generally believed to have an advantage in the present system.\n\n\u201cWhy does Tampon Tim [Trump\u2019s derisive nickname for Walz] hate the Constitution so much?,\u201d the Trump campaign posted on its official X account.\n\nThe comment overlooked the fact that Trump himself has been accused of calling for \u201cterminating the constitution\u201d in support of his lie that Joe Biden and the Democrats stole the 2020 presidential election.\n\nResearch published last month by Pew showed 63% of American voters favouring electing the president by the popular vote, although support was greatest among Democrats, while a small majority of Republicans favoured keeping the electoral college.\n\nHarris said in a 2019 appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live that she was \u201copen to the discussion\u201d of changing the current system, saying the popular vote had been \u201cdiminished\u201d. But she has avoided more categorical statements on the subject.\n\nIn a 60 Minutes interview on CBS that aired on Monday, the vice-president said she had recently told Walz that \u201cyou need to be a little more careful on how you say things.\u201d",

        "text": "West Health-Gallup Poll: Healthcare in U.S. 2024 Presidential Election\nWASHINGTON, D.C. \u2013 Oct. 9, 2024 \u2013 Though in this year\u2019s presidential election healthcare has seemingly taken a back to other issues including the economy and democracy, nearly eight in 10 registered voters still say the issue that has been critical in nearly every presidential campaign in modern history, remains extremely (37%) or very important (42%) to whom they cast their vote, according to a new a West Health-Gallup poll of voters. This sentiment is consistent with what\u2019s been expressed in most previous elections, although slightly more voters in 2000 and 2012 rated the issue as being extremely important.\n\nWest Health and Gallup partnered to measure the potential impact of healthcare as a voting issue in the 2024 election. The findings are part of Gallup\u2019s broader research into election issues measured in a September 16-28 poll of U.S. registered voters. In the survey, terrorism, national security, the Supreme Court, immigration and education ranked similar in importance to healthcare but also behind the economy and democracy.\n\n\u201cHealthcare so far has been one of those important but sleeper issues in this election, but one that needs a serious reckoning,\u201d said Tim Lash, President, West Health Policy Center, a nonprofit organization focused on healthcare and aging. \u201cPoliticians, policy makers and elected officials who ignore or downplay the issues of healthcare affordability, prescription drug pricing, access and equity do so at the risk of their campaigns, but more importantly at the risk of the general public.\u201d\n\nDemocrats are more likely than Republicans and independents to view healthcare in higher importance, with 90% saying it is extremely (45%) or very (45%) important to their vote. This compares to 72% of Republicans who rank healthcare an important issue, but a third (34%) of these registered voters, also found healthcare extremely important to them. The issue is even more so for independents, 77% deeming it important and a third of these voters also indicate its extremely important.\n\nRegistered older American voters, who are more likely to use healthcare services, rate healthcare as a bigger factor to their vote than younger Americans. In this voting bloc of people 65 and older, 86% say healthcare will be an extremely (40%) or very (46%) important issue when it comes to their vote, compared with 80% of those between ages of 45 and 64 and 75% of those younger than 45.\n\nNonetheless, age appears to have a modest effect on the importance placed on healthcare beyond party affiliation, such that older Republican and Democratic-affiliated voters are more likely than younger voters with the same political leanings to say it is an important issue.\n\nVoters Perceive Harris as Better Than Trump on the Issue\n\nRegistered voters, by 54% to 44%, think Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris would do a better job than Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump handling healthcare. That advantage is largely seen because independents believe Harris is better on the issue by 11 percentage points, 54% to 43%. Republicans and Democrats believe their own party\u2019s candidate is better on healthcare, but Harris does better among Democrats (96%) than Trump does among Republicans (87%).\n\nHarris leading in healthcare is consistent with prior Gallup polling. In past presidential election years in which the question was asked, U.S. voters have consistently picked the Democratic candidate as better than the Republican candidate on healthcare. It is notable however, the Democratic advantage has narrowed since 2004, compared with the 1992-2000 elections.\n\nMethodology\n\nResults for this West Health-Gallup poll are based on telephone interviews conducted Sept. 16-28, 2024, with a random sample of 941 registered voters, aged 18 and older, living in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. For results based on the total sample of registered voters, the margin of sampling error is \u00b14 percentage points at the 95% confidence level. All reported margins of sampling error include computed design effects for weighting.\n\nAbout West Health\n\nSolely funded by philanthropists Gary and Mary West, West Health is a family of nonprofit and nonpartisan organizations including the Gary and Mary West Foundation and Gary and Mary West Health Institute in San Diego, and the Gary and Mary West Health Policy Center in Washington, D.C.

        "text": "Will white women abandon Republicans and vote for Kamala Harris?\nWhite female voters have been the backbone of the GOP for decades \u2013 but polls indicate their support for the party may erode this November, thanks to younger white women who are moving left at breakneck speed.\n\nIn the weeks after the 2016 presidential election, after Donald Trump stunned the world by defeating Hillary Clinton, media outlets seized on white women to explain his shock win. Forty-seven per cent of white women voted for Trump, while 45% backed Clinton, according to an analysis of validated voter files by the Pew Research Center.\n\nTrump\u2019s success with white women highlighted a longstanding truth: this group votes for Republicans. Over the last 72 years, a plurality of white women have voted for the Democratic candidate in only two presidential elections \u2013 in 1964, when Lyndon Johnson won 44 states, and in 1996, when Bill Clinton ran in a three-way race. Trump\u2019s lead with white women even grew in 2020, when 53% supported him. In contrast, 95% of Black women voted for Joe Biden in 2020, along with 61% of Hispanic women, Pew found.\n\nBut quite a bit has changed since 2020 \u2013 especially for women. The US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade in 2022, transforming abortion rights into a major election issue. Kamala Harris took over as the Democratic candidate from Joe Biden, becoming the first woman of color to secure a major-party nomination for president. All this raises the question: will 2024 be the year that white women, who make up almost 40% of the national electorate, finally join women of color in supporting the Democrats?\n\nWell, not necessarily. But the gap very well may shrink.\n\nThere are signs that younger white women are peeling off from the GOP \u2013 a trend that is linked to a steady drift by all young women to the left.\n\n\u201cYoung women of color and young white women, in my research, are pretty uniformly liberal and feminist,\u201d said Melissa Deckman, CEO of the Public Religion Research Institute and author of the recent book The Politics of Gen Z: How the Youngest Voters Will Shape Our Democracy. \u201cI think Harris\u2019s selection as the nominee now \u2013 as opposed to Biden \u2013 has really further made them enthusiastic about voting. So I strongly suspect that young, white women voters are going to defy the longer-term trend of white women in general voting for Republicans.\u201d\n\nYoung women are increasingly queer, increasingly secular and getting married later in life \u2013 all characteristics that tend to be linked with liberalism and support for the Democratic party. (People who identify as liberal are very likely to be Democrats, though the inverse is not necessarily true \u2013 not all Democrats identify as liberal.)\n\nBetween 2011 and 2024, liberal identification among white women rose by 6%, according to a Gallup analysis shared with the Guardian. Such identification also rose by 6% among Black women, but fell by 2% among Hispanic women.\n\nGen Z is the most diverse generation of Americans yet, but Gallup research suggests that doesn\u2019t explain young women\u2019s leftward drift. Between 2017 and 2024, 41% of white women between the ages of 18 and 29 identified as liberals \u2013 2 percentage points more than their peers of color.\n\nYoung women are also unusually involved in politics. Women have long outvoted men, but in 2020, 60% of 18- to 29-year-old white women voted \u2013 more than any other group of youth voters, according to an analysis of voter file and American Community Survey population data by the Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement. Fifty-five per cent voted for Biden, the center found, after analyzing data from AP VoteCast.\n\nTrump\u2019s 2016 victory may have something to do with these trends. Raised by Democratic-leaning independents, Chloe Fowler said Trump\u2019s election was a critical inflection point in her political evolution. She was a sophomore in high school when Trump won; the day after, somebody in her school hallway shouted gleefully: \u201cGrab \u2019em by the pussy!\u201d\n\n\u201cThings like that stick with us,\u201d recalled Fowler, who is white. A few months later, her mom took her to the Women\u2019s March in Omaha, Nebraska. \u201cThat was a very pivotal moment for me, honestly \u2013 doing a bunch of chants with her and wearing the pink cat ear hats.\u201d\n\nFowler is now the vice-president of Nebraska Young Democrats. The 23-year-old has been phone-banking furiously in her home district \u2013 Nebraska\u2019s second congressional district, which may end up deciding whether Trump or Harris becomes president.\n\n\u2018Why is this race so close?\u2019\n\nA 19th News/SurveyMonkey poll in September found that white women narrowly prefer Harris to Trump, 42% to 40%. (The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 1%.) The remaining 18% can make or break the election, of course. The gender gap between white women and white men is larger. Fifty per cent of white men prefer Trump, with only 36% supporting Harris.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Stakes \u2014 Presidential Transition Free newsletter We will guide you through the aftermath of the US election and the transition to a Trump presidency Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

While women as a whole may end up voting for Harris \u2013 a September New York Times/Siena poll showed that 54% of women planned to vote for Harris, compared with 40% of men \u2013 white women, Junn predicted, will remain Republicans in 2024. \u201cIf all of a sudden, the white women were like: \u2018Oh, my God, I\u2019m burning my bra and my Barbie shoes and my long fingernails and all the plastic sprays I put into my body\u2019 \u2013 we\u2019re not seeing that,\u201d Junn said. \u201cWhy is this race so close? It\u2019s so close because these groups remain fairly consistent in their partisan loyalty.\u201d\n\nPolling from Galvanize Action, an organization that seeks to mobilize moderate women \u2013 especially in the critical \u201cblue wall\u201d states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan \u2013 has found the race in a dead heat among moderate white women, who are split 43% to 44% in favor of the former president. These women, who Galvanize Action defines as not ideologically entrenched as Democrats or Republicans, account for more than 5 million voters in those three states.\n\nTrump has the edge when it comes to these women\u2019s top issues of the economy and immigration, but the women polled by Galvanize Action trust Harris more on democracy and reproductive freedom.\n\n\u201cEven among women who say that economy or democracy is their No 1 issue, a good segment of those people also say: \u2018I\u2019m not going to vote for anyone that won\u2019t protect abortion,\u2019\u201d said Jackie Payne, Galvanize Action\u2019s executive director and founder.\n\nDemocrats are hoping that abortion rights-related ballot measures \u2013 which voters will decide on in the battlegrounds of Arizona, Nevada and Nebraska\u2019s second congressional district \u2013 will spur turnout among their base. However, white women may in effect vote split-ticket, simultaneously voting for a pro-abortion rights measure and for Republicans. More than half of white women voted for Ohio\u2019s 2023 abortion-related ballot measure \u2013 but more than 60% of white women supported Mike DeWine, the Republican governor who signed a six-week abortion ban into law, in 2022, just months after Roe fell.\n\n\u201cThis is going to be all about turnout. This is going to be a very, very close election,\u201d said Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers. \u201cThe Democratic party counts on women. They count particularly on Black women to turn out. Will they be more energized?\u201d",

In the first of a four-part series , the South China Morning Post looks at how voting is carried out and some factors that may affect the timing of results.\n\nThe 2024 US presidential election pitting Vice-President Kamala Harris against former president Donald Trump is now less than a month away. Here are some key dates and issues that may affect the timing of the result and transition to a new administration.\n\nEarly voting\n\nForty-seven states, Washington DC, Guam, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands offer early in-person voting to all registered voters; some have been doing so since August.\n\nThree states \u2013 Alabama, Mississippi and New Hampshire \u2013 do not offer early in-person voting, though they may provide these options to eligible absentee voters.\n\nThe winner in the US presidential race between Republican Donald Trump, a former president, and Democrat Kamala Harris, the current vice-president, is slated to be certified by Congress in Washington on January 6, 2025.

The average start date for early voting is 27 days before the election.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough most states have absentee voting, deadlines and rules on who can take part vary. Some states require notification about the reason for an absentee ballot request. In most states, an absentee ballot must be requested in each election, but some allow voters to sign up to have absentee ballots sent to them in each election.",

        "text": "The Baker School and Haslam Put Economics in Focus for the 2024 Presidential Election\nThe Baker School and Haslam Put Economics in Focus for the 2024 Presidential Election\n\nKNOXVILLE, TENNESSEE \u2013 The Howard H. Baker Jr. School of Public Policy and Public Affairs (Baker School) and the Haslam College of Business (Haslam) at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, welcomed a pair of national pundits \u2013 Michael Strain and Matthew Yglesias \u2014 to discuss economics and the 2024 Presidential Election on September 25. The event was the Baker School\u2019s second installment of fall programming, encouraging the campus community and the greater Knoxville community to get informed, get engaged, and vote.\n\nHaslam\u2019s Professor of Practice Monica Langley moderated the debate between Strain and Yglesias, drawing on her nearly 30 years of experience covering CEOs, billionaires and presidential candidates for The Wall Street Journal to steer the conversation covering five key topics that are influencing the economy and the election.\n\nStrain is the director of Economic Policy Studies and the Arthur F. Burns Scholar in Political Economy at the American Enterprise Institute. He oversees the Institute\u2019s work in economic policy, financial markets, international trade and finance, tax and budget policy, welfare economics, and health care policy. Yglesias is the founder and author of Slow Boring, a subscription newsletter on American public policy, covering economic policy and political pragmatism.\n\nStrain and Yglesias provided insights on Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump\u2019s economic policy plans regarding inflation, industrial and trade, taxes, immigration, and the American dream.\n\nIs inflation really still a problem?\n\nStrain first gave the definition of inflation \u2013 the rate at which prices in general in the economy are increasing. He believes that the high inflation numbers that we saw in 2021 and 2022 are in the rearview mirror. Even if we had a zero percent inflation rate, our groceries, clothes, etc., would still be 20% more expensive since President Biden took office. This is what Strain believes people are reacting to \u2013 the prices they see and not the inflation. As Yglesias put it, \u201cthe public is always going to want things to be cheap,\u201d and what former President Trump\u2019s campaign is putting forward isn\u2019t a policy that would lead to lower price costs.\n\nTariffs leading to trade wars.\n\nIn President Trump\u2019s first administration, he put into place tariffs that lead to what some call a trade war, but the Biden administration kept many of those in place. In his campaign now, Trump is proposing 10 to 20 percent tariffs across the board.\n\nBoth Strain and Yglesias agree that this is a bad proposal and that there isn\u2019t a lot of support for it. Strain pointed out that those tariffs in Trump\u2019s first term were sold as \u201cconcentrated benefits and diffuse costs,\u201d but what it did was cost manufacturing jobs and raised prices of imported goods.\n\nYglesias showed a wider view of the trade issue, saying that there used to be a lot of optimism about the economic integration between the U.S. and China. However, over the years, there has been a hard change to that view, and there is more of a security competition with China. The U.S. needs to make sure that the U.S. and its allies are controlling the supply chain of materials.\n\nWhich candidate has a better chance of delivering economic prosperity with their tax proposals?\n\nBoth candidates are trying to keep the voters they have and gain more with their tax proposals, but Yglesias thinks that this is something voters should ignore. As both Yglesias and Strain point out, no matter who wins, the provisions in the Tax and Jobs Act of 2017 will expire in 2025, and those will need to be addressed \u2013 not only by the president but also by Congress. Therefore. it will come down to the balance of political power between the two to determine what and how much of the provisions are extended. Both candidates agree on extending a majority of those provisions and disagree on the others. It\u2019ll be expensive no matter what.\n\nThe hot topic that no one agrees on \u2013 immigration.\n\nMost of the discussion in the campaign surrounding immigration is with a national security approach, but Langley asked Strain and Yglesias to take it on as an economic impact for the labor force.\n\nYglesias, who has a book called One Billion Americans: The Case for Thinking Bigger, said a growing population drives prosperity and creates more economic opportunities. He appreciates Trump\u2019s security focus view on open borders as that is what voters are focused on. Yglesias said it allows for the economic impact discussion on immigration. However, he would like to see a more optimistic view of the fact that so many people want to come live in the U.S. That is not to say he is for an open border and chaos, but that it is a tremendous opportunity and we should be trying to find a way to safely and orderly bring people in.\n\nStrain explained that there are two ways to grow an economy \u2013 add workers or make the workers you have more productive. The latter of the two is the most difficult, and, for the first, we are currently looking at a demographic situation in which we are going to have a declining workforce. He claimed that if we want to have the economic growth that people expect, we are going to need more immigrants because, in the past, they have demonstrated that they add enormously to our economy. Strain finds Trump and his running mate Senator JD Vance\u2019s rhetoric regarding immigrants and deportation dangerous and sees it as an act of economic self-sabotage.\n\nAs Yglesias put it, immigration is what people have done since the foundation of the country, and it\u2019s the cornerstone of the U.S. and its economy.\n\nDoes either candidate offer a vision for the American dream to the future generation?\n\nIt was clear by this point that neither Strain nor Yglesias had been impressed with either candidates\u2019 campaigns. Strain doesn\u2019t believe we really know what to expect from either of them, and that a lot of what happens will depend on the composition of Congress, not just the presidency.\n\nYglesias believes that Harris has done a good job focusing on the opportunity economy, something that started in the second term of President Obama\u2019s administration. In her convention speech, she talked all about the opportunities and aspirations of America. However, polls show that people trust former President Trump over Vice President Harris when it comes to the economy. Strain said that comes from her being the Vice President of the Biden administration, which, in Strain\u2019s mind, took part in the most irresponsible and reckless fiscal policy in decades. Even as she tries to distance herself from it, Yglesias believes that isn\u2019t enough and that people, including himself, want to hear her honest opinion about the Biden administration\u2019s economic policy.\n\nBipartisan support can be found in economic policy.\n\nAlthough the question on hand for this debate was which candidate could deliver prosperity, both Strain and Yglesias ended on a note of bipartisanship.\n\nStrain stated that America is better than our politics, which you can see if you approach economic policy in a budgetary sense. There is enormous bipartisan agreement that there should be no reduction in Social Security spending or in Medicare spending. Although that has been the status quo for years, there is now bipartisan agreement that the tax burden on the bottom 98 percent of households shouldn\u2019t be increased. All of these are in support of a stronger middle class.\n\nYglesias says that we should be able to see and admit that the partisan disagreements are fierce around certain dimensions, but in the analysis of bigger picture economic questions, the parties don\u2019t have widely contrasting visions. They just need to sit down at the table together and make a deal.\n\nYou can watch the full discussion here.",

In 2016, Donald Trump won the Commonwealth by .7% of the vote, while in 2020, Joe Biden won by 1.2% of the vote. 2024 promises to be no different.\n\nTo help the Arcadia community, as well as the community at large, better understand the importance of Pennsylvania in the 2024 presidential election, the Division of Civic & Global Engagement hosted a panel discussion on Tuesday, Oct. 8, in conjunction with the Rotary Club of Chestnut Hill. The event was part of the larger Arcadia Votes initiative.\n\nArcadiaVotes, Montco Votes, PA Youth Vote, Vote 411, and the Rotary Club of Chestnut Hill had tables set up to provide information about the election and voting process before the event. Students had the opportunity to register to vote, request mail-in ballots, sign up for a shuttle to the Montgomery County Voter Services satellite office on Oct. 28, sign up for a shuttle to the polls on Nov. 5, and have some fun with photo props and prizes.\n\nThe panel included Angelique Hinton, executive director of PA Youth Vote; Farah Jimenez, executive director of the Philadelphia Education Fund and political analyst on 6ABC and the Philadelphia Inquirer\u2019s opinion pages; Samuel Katz, historian, filmmaker and political analyst focused on Philadelphia; and Amy Widestrom, political scientist and executive director of the League of Women Voters of Pennsylvania.\n\n\u201cThis is not an evening about partisan politics,\u201d David Hawkings, former managing editor at Congressional Quarterly and the event moderator, said. \u201cThis is not an evening to advocate for one side or the other. This is an evening to be educated about civics.\u201d\n\nThe discussion started with Hawkings asking the panel why they decided to participate in such a forum. Each panelist agreed that it is important to help voters understand the issues.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here to make sure that people understand how to mobilize and engage young people,\u201d Hinton explained. \u201cI work with young people every day, and I think that it\u2019s important to understand that some young people are not getting equitable access to education around how government works, so that has a lot to do with why you see disparity in participation.\u201d\n\nRebeca Velazquez and Jaden Peters, juniors at Arcadia, came to the event with an open mind. While they may be leaning one way, both said they valued the opinions of the panelists and the discussion they brought to campus\n\n\u201cI came for more insights into the issues and to hear how the experts view the election,\u201d Velazquez said. \u201cIt could potentially influence my views.\u201d\n\nThe conversation turned toward the issues that matter most to Pennsylvanians. While the national media may lead voters outside of Pennsylvania to believe that fracking is the number one issue for Pennsylvanians, the panel explained that it is just one of many that Commonwealth residents are concerned about.\n\n\u201cImmigration and reproductive rights are major issues that are deeply dividing,\u201d Katz remarked. \u201cThe economic issues here are going to be very important too, particularly in southwest Pennsylvania. These are the things that are pulling us apart.\u201d\n\nJimenez explained that the fracking issue can bleed over into other industries as well.\n\n\u201cI might have some concerns about electing a candidate that\u2019s really more interested in regulating an industry that does provide real resources,\u201d she reasoned. \u201cNot just jobs for my family, but resources for the Commonwealth.\u201d\n\nThe panel took a moment to remind the audience that there are other important elections happening around the Commonwealth this year and in the future. Other races in Pennsylvania this year include for attorney general, auditor general, and treasurer.\n\n\u201cWhat we need to do is encourage our young voters,\u201d Widestrom said. \u201cWhat matters to you? It\u2019s okay to split your ticket, but find the person who aligns with your values. And you might have to do a little research, but I really encourage particularly young voters to lean into the issues that matter because I know that you\u2019re not thinking much about the parties or the institutions.\u201d\n\nThe evening ended with a question-and-answer session with the panelists. Several students were given the chance to ask the panels for their thoughts on subjects like overcoming the increasing division in the country, the impact of the two-party system in the United States, and how the Senate race in Pennsylvania will impact the overall composition of the Senate.\n\nBunny Figueroa, a senior, asks the panel about the two-party system in the United States",

This is especially true when there is a high degree of relevance between messaging and an online user's ideology. There is no escaping it. It is happening continuously and constantly.\u201d\n\nCan legislation help ease election anxieties?\n\nSen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., together with Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., recently introduced legislation to create mental health warning label requirements for social media platforms. The bipartisan Stop the Scroll Act(opens in new window) would ensure users are aware of the potential mental health risks associated with social media use.\n\nThe average person spends 2.5 hours a day on social media. According to this year\u2019s American Psychiatric Association\u2019s annual mental health poll(opens in new window), adults in the U.S. are feeling increasingly anxious, with 73% of those surveyed saying they feel particularly anxious about the election.\n\n\u201cPeople are getting fed up with the political discussions online, but there is still a heavy population that\u2019s using social media to promote their messaging and appeal to their base, so we\u2019re constantly exposed to it,\u201d Lightman said. \u201cWe\u2019re constantly inundated.\u201d\n\nHow are CMU professors addressing anxiety?\n\nJ. David Creswell(opens in new window), the William S. Dietrich II Professor in Psychology and Neuroscience at CMU, said if people care about the outcome of an upcoming election, it can be easy to get stuck in patterns of anxiety and stress.\n\n\u201cElection season is kind of like riding in a plane. We don\u2019t have much control over what happens, and for some people that can be overwhelming,\u201d Creswell said. \u201cOne approach can be \u2014 to wrestle back a sense of control during election season \u2014 is to think about ways you do have control, such as how you can vote and make a difference. Researchers call this coping strategy cognitive reappraisal. It\u2019s basically thinking differently in ways that lessen our negative emotions.\u201d\n\nCreswell has dedicated much of his research to understanding how mindfulness and equanimity can enhance resilience and performance. Leveraging over 15 years of research from his Health and Human Performance Lab(opens in new window) at CMU, Creswell co-founded Equa(opens in new window), a mindfulness training app designed to help users manage stress and improve their overall wellbeing. CMU students, faculty and staff can download the Equa app(opens in new window) and use their @andrew.cmu.edu email address to unlock a complimentary subscription, thanks to the university\u2019s partnership with Equa Health.\n\nWhat strategies are students using to cope with election anxiety?\n\nSofia Reyes Franco considers herself somewhat anxious about the election. As a senior studying information systems at Carnegie Mellon, she is familiar with how algorithms work. She\u2019s actually in the process of developing an app that would use algorithms to help develop personal styling choices.\n\nFranco has plenty of friends who discuss politics online and in person, but she prefers to keep her political views to herself.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to stay out of it for the most part,\u201d she said. \u201cMy voice will be heard when I cast my vote.\u201d\n\nFranco\u2019s strategy for keeping calm between now and Nov. 5 includes staying off social media and keeping busy with school work and other interests.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on the Club Swimming(opens in new window) team, so I\u2019ll go to practice. Club swimming is a fun way to keep in shape and be part of a great group of people on campus. We have practices three times per week and have various social events,\u201d Franco said. \u201cBut mostly, I\u2019ll just focus on my homework. I also read a lot. I\u2019ll read just to kind of get myself out of this space and be transported into a different reality.\u201d\n\nBurke has a golden retriever that loves to go on walks, so getting outdoors will be his number one strategy for managing stress between now and election day. He and his wife also enjoy going to the gym.\n\nThe analytical approach to social media and elections\n\nAs students in Lightman\u2019s Measuring Social(opens in new window) class this semester, Burke and Franco are gaining tools and knowledge for analyzing social media to benefit global brands, and they are getting to apply it all in real time.\n\n\u201cGood timing or bad timing, it\u2019s super interesting to be taking this course during the presidential campaign. We\u2019ll learn and discuss something in class, and then I\u2019ll look at my phone and it\u2019s all right there. So, there\u2019s that epiphany moment of \u2018oh, right, that makes sense.\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nGiven the vigorous and sometimes heated debates online, Burke particularly appreciates Lightman\u2019s analytical approach.\n\n\u201cIt really helps you to take a step back and put a different lens on how you view these things, to look at what\u2019s happening online more objectively rather than get caught up in it,\u201d Burke said.",

        "text": "US Vote 2024: Election unlikely to impact shale output as producers favor profit over growth\nThe US presidential election is looming, but the shale oil industry is unlikely to be significantly impacted by the outcome, according to a new analysis by Rystad Energy. Despite the rhetoric and policy platforms from the two candidates, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, the tight oil sector is expected to continue its steady growth, driven more by market forces and company strategy than by government policy. The industry's focus on profitability and shareholder returns, rather than chasing production growth, means that operators are unlikely to be influenced by promises of support or potential regulations from either candidate.\n\nThis shift in strategy, dubbed \u201cShale 4.0\u201d by Rystad Energy, has been materializing for some time. It is a significant departure from the industry's growth-at-all-costs approach in the early days of the shale revolution, which was fueled by easy access to capital and a focus on rapid production expansion. However, financial limitations and increasing pressure from investors to prioritize returns have led to a more disciplined approach to growth.\n\nShale production growth in the US will be driven by a combination of factors, including rising oil prices, improving operator efficiency and increasing long-term investment from acquisitions. While the industry may face challenges in the coming years, including increasing competition from renewable energy sources and growing concerns about climate change, the short-term outlook for shale remains positive.\n\nThe US onshore industry has learned to live with a high degree of uncertainty, and the presidential election is just one of many factors on operators\u2019 radars. Shale production has proven to be incredibly resilient, and we expect it to continue to play a major role in the global energy landscape for years to come. At the end of the day, the industry is driven by market fundamentals, not by politics. Matthew Bernstein, Senior Analyst, Upstream Research\n\nLearn more with Rystad Energy\u2019s Shale Solution.\n\nUS shale\u2019s transformation into a more financially sustainable sector has been ongoing for several years, far predating this presidential election cycle. The industry's growth kickstarted while former President Barack Obama was in office, and later matured during Trump\u2019s term in office, as producers shifted their focus from rapid expansion to financial discipline. Despite some tensions with the Biden administration, the industry has continued to thrive, driven by changing investor attitudes and financial pressures rather than government policy.\n\nDespite his strong vocal support for the oil and gas industry, whether a second Trump administration could actually increase US shale production above its current trajectory is uncertain. The industry's shift towards prioritizing shareholder returns and long-term growth through acquisitions has led to a more disciplined approach to investment. This means that even if prices rise, companies are unlikely to significantly increase spending, as production has somewhat decoupled from oil and gas prices. As a result, the traditional link between high prices and increased drilling activity has been weakened, with companies instead focusing on maintaining capital discipline and maximizing returns.\n\nA Democratic administration could pose potential risks, but these seem highly unlikely for political and economic reasons. Past administrations may have imposed stricter regulations, drilling restrictions and heightened scrutiny of mergers and acquisitions, but Harris has not communicated a desire to pursue these options. The industry is also concerned about accelerated investment in alternative energy projects, which could accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels. A ban on new permitting on federal land, while unlikely, would have a significant impact on production in key basins such as the Permian Delaware.\n\nIncreased investments in clean energy alternatives may be a concern in the long term, but short-term impact is unlikely to be significant for two reasons. One, US consumers prefer an oil and energy-intensive lifestyle, and for this energy to come at a low cost. Despite policy support for electric vehicles (EV), wind and solar generation and most recently hydrogen, US oil consumption has only flattened, not declined. Domestic natural gas consumption continues to climb. And two, oil prices are set on a global market \u2014 even if US oil consumption were to decline, lower prices would likely stimulate oil demand elsewhere.\n\nHelped by recent high-profile mergers and acquisitions (M&A), US shale\u2019s output growth is becoming increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few large players. The research shows that the top six companies in the Permian Basin, the largest shale play in the US, now control over 60% of the remaining commercial net oil resources in the region. This consolidation is likely to continue, as smaller players struggle to compete with the scale and efficiency of their larger rivals. The industry is rapidly becoming a game of scale, and only the largest and most efficient players will be able to compete in the long term.\n\nContacts\n\nMatthew Bernstein\n\nSenior Analyst, Upstream Research\n\nPhone: +1 917 207 1616\n\nmatthew.bernstein@rystadenergy.com\n\nElliot Busby\n\nHead of Media Relations\n\nPhone: +47 40 02 41 94\n\nelliot.busby@rystadenergy.com\n\nAbout Rystad Energy\n\nRystad Energy is a leading global independent research and energy intelligence company dedicated to helping clients navigate the future of energy.

        "text": "New PwC Survey on US election business impact reveals majority of C-suite executives believe a recession will occur in the next six months\nExecutives cite US economic policy as the top policy risk under both a Harris and Trump administration\n\nExecutives identify US competitiveness as a key concern in this election regardless of who is president\n\nWednesday, October 9, 2024 \u2014 In the lead up to the 2024 US presidential election, PwC surveyed 709 C-suite executives on an array of economic, political and regulatory risks that will affect business. While key indicators are moving in the right direction, particularly inflation and lower interest rates, executives in PwC\u2019s latest Pulse Survey: Executive takes on Election 2024 aren\u2019t convinced the US economy is out of the woods just yet. Among respondents, 61% see a recession happening in the next six months, a surprising jump from the 49% who said the same in our June 2024 Pulse Survey. Additionally, 44% of CEOs surveyed say changing priorities to prepare for potential recession is a significant challenge.\n\nThe data indicates that the election is playing a significant role in how executives are preparing for the future and thinking about risk and growth. Most executives (76%) agree that there will be divided government after the election and 77% expect an increase in executive orders regardless of who is president. More than three quarters of executives (76%) say the outcome of the election will affect their approach to regulatory compliance, and 74% say the same about trade decisions. Additionally, 71% agree that, regardless of who is president, post-election trade and tax policies will hurt US competitiveness.\n\n\n\nBusiness leaders cite US economic policy as the biggest policy risk area under both candidates. The remaining policy risk areas vary respective to each candidate.\n\n\n\nExecutives\u2019 views on policy risks under a Harris administration\n\nMore than a third (36%) cite US corporate tax policy as a top-3 policy risk area under Harris, and 33% cite regulatory oversight, compared with 31% and 28% under Trump. The Harris administration\u2019s proposed 28% corporate tax rate may affect domestic investments, with 75% of executives indicating they would significantly reduce US-based investments if the new tax rate were implemented.\n\nExecutives\u2019 views on policy risks under a Trump administration\n\nAbout a third (32%) cite foreign relations and trade (31%) as a top-3 policy risk area under Trump, compared with 25% and 27% under Harris. The Trump administration\u2019s proposed universal tariffs also remain a concern among business leaders, with 75% agreeing that a 10% universal tariff on imports would significantly hinder their growth.\n\nExecutives\u2019 investment plans under Harris and Trump\n\nUnder either administration, at least 78% of executives expect to either maintain or increase their current levels of investment in the areas we asked about, but there are slight differences in investment strategies under each administration. Executives say they would increase investments in AI with either outcome, 52% for Harris and 53% for Trump, respectively. However, if Harris wins the election, 56% of executives say they would increase investments in compliance and regulatory, compared to 47% under Trump, and 55% would invest more in sustainability, compared to 46% under Trump. More than half (53%) of executives say they would increase investments in capital projects in the US if Trump wins the election, compared to 49% under Harris.\n\n\"Executives are contending with an increasingly complex and volatile business landscape, further complicated by the upcoming election,\" said Tyson Cornell, PwC US Advisory Leader. \"Looking forward, they are actively scenario planning to strategically balance risks and opportunities, positioning them to emerge stronger from any policy changes that may affect their business.\"\n\n",

        "text": "Americans\u2019 Views of 2024 Election News\nMost Americans are following the election closely, though roughly half say it\u2019s hard to know what\u2019s true\n\nPeople watch the ABC News presidential debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump at a watch party in West Hollywood, California, on Sept. 10, 2024. (Mario Tama/Getty Images)\n\nHow we did this Pew Research Center conducted this study to better understand how U.S. adults get news and information about the 2024 presidential election. The survey of 9,680 U.S. adults was conducted from Sept. 16 to 22, 2024. Everyone who completed the survey is a member of the Center\u2019s American Trends Panel (ATP), a group of people recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses who have agreed to take surveys regularly. This kind of recruitment gives nearly all U.S. adults a chance of selection. Surveys were conducted either online or by telephone with a live interviewer. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other factors. Read more about the ATP\u2019s methodology. Here are the questions used for this report, the topline and the survey methodology. Pew Research Center is a subsidiary of The Pew Charitable Trusts, its primary funder. This is the latest report in Pew Research Center\u2019s ongoing investigation of the state of news, information and journalism in the digital age, a research program funded by The Pew Charitable Trusts, with generous support from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation.\n\nAs Americans navigate the abundance of information about the 2024 U.S. presidential election, many of them are seeing news they think is inaccurate \u2013 and having a hard time distinguishing fact from fiction.\n\nA new Pew Research Center survey finds that about three-quarters of U.S. adults (73%) say they have seen inaccurate news coverage about the election at least somewhat often, including 37% who have seen this kind of information extremely or very often.\n\nAbout half of Americans (52%) say they generally find it difficult to determine what is true and what is not when getting news about the election. And 28% separately say that it\u2019s been difficult for them to find reliable information about the presidential election.\n\nSupporters of the two major political parties are having vastly different experiences with election news in these ways.\n\nRepublicans (including independents who lean toward the GOP) are much more likely than Democrats and Democratic leaners to say they have seen inaccurate coverage and that they are having a hard time sorting out the truth.\n\nAnd Republicans are less likely than Democrats to say it is easy for them to find reliable information about the election (29% vs. 52%, respectively).\n\nOverall, Americans are much less likely to be wary of the information from their most frequent sources of election news. Much smaller shares say they at least sometimes see inaccurate information from the sources they turn to most often for news and information about the election than say the same about election news in general.\n\nAt the same time, people also say inaccurate information is coming from sources other than news outlets: 58% of Americans say they have heard people they know share information about the election that they think is inaccurate at least somewhat often. There is little difference between the parties on this question \u2013 Republicans and Democrats say they hear inaccurate information from their personal circles at roughly the same rates.\n\nJump to more information about Americans\u2019 views on the accuracy of election news.\n\nHow Americans\u2019 attention toward election news has changed throughout the campaign\n\nOverall, about seven-in-ten Americans say they are following news about the candidates for the 2024 presidential election very (28%) or fairly (40%) closely. This is up from 58% in April and 65% in July, mirroring a pattern also seen in 2020 in which attention increases closer to Election Day.\n\nBetween April and September of this year, the increase was driven particularly by Democrats, who were slightly less likely than Republicans to be following election news closely in the two earlier surveys. Now, there is no difference between the two parties in their levels of attention.\n\nAbout six-in-ten Americans say they are worn out by so much coverage of the campaign, while nearly four-in-ten say they like seeing a lot of coverage. These shares are similar to those measured in April, as well as in surveys conducted in 2020 and 2016.\n\nJump to more about how much attention Americans are paying to election news.\n\nWhat kinds of news about the election are Americans seeing \u2013 and what do they want to see?\n\nThe survey asked Americans how much they have heard about several specific election-related topics that have been in the news in recent months.\n\nWe found that most people say they have heard or read a lot about Vice President Kamala Harris replacing President Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee (70%), the first assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump in July (66%), and the debate between Harris and Trump on Sept. 10 (64%). (The survey questions were finalized before the second assassination attempt on Trump in September.)\n\nSmaller shares say they have heard a lot about the vice presidential candidates, the two parties\u2019 national conventions, and third-party candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. endorsing Trump when he dropped out of the race. Still, large majorities of Americans say they have heard at least a little about each of these topics.\n\nMore generally, news about the candidates\u2019 comments and actions on the campaign trail appears to be the most common type of coverage people are seeing. Four-in-ten U.S. adults say this is the type of election news they see most, outpacing information about the candidates\u2019 stances on issues (17%), their moral characters (14%) or which candidate is leading the race (13%).\n\nThis does not align with what Americans are most interested in. For example, higher shares say they are extremely or very interested in news about candidates\u2019 stances on the issues (75%) and their moral characters (60%) than say the same about candidates\u2019 comments and actions during the campaign (49%).\n\nAbout half of Americans (49%) say they are extremely or very interested in the candidates\u2019 career experiences, while just 3% say this is the topic they see the most news about.\n\nJump to more information about what election news topics Americans are seeing.\n\nAge differences in primary platforms used for election news\n\nAmericans get news about politics and the election in a wide variety of ways. No single platform dominates: About a third of U.S. adults (35%) say TV is their most common source of election news, while roughly one-in-five each say the same about news websites or apps (21%) and social media (20%). Smaller shares primarily use other platforms, including search engines, podcasts, radio or print publications.\n\nYounger and older Americans are getting election news in very different ways. Nearly half of U.S. adults under 30 (46%) say that social media are their most common source of election news, while others in this age category turn to different digital sources like news websites or apps (18%), search engines (12%) or podcasts (6%). One-in-ten say TV is their most common source of election news.\n\nBut among U.S. adults ages 65 and older, a majority (63%) say TV is their top source. The same is true for 44% of those ages 50 to 64.\n\nThe survey also asked about several specific news outlets as sources of political and election news; there was little change on these questions since 2020. About two-thirds of Americans say national TV networks (ABC, CBS and NBC) are at least a minor source of political and election news for them, including three-in-ten who cite this as a major source. CNN and Fox News are each sources of election news for about half of Americans, with about two-in-ten naming each cable news network as a major source.\n\nSmaller shares cite other outlets as major or minor sources of election news, including MSNBC, The New York Times, NPR, The Washington Post and conservative talk radio.\n\nWhile Democrats and Republicans largely give similar answers about what platforms they use most often for election news (e.g., TV, social media, etc.), there are huge differences between the two parties on several of these specific outlets.\n\nRepublicans are much more likely than Democrats to say Fox News and talk radio are at least minor sources of election news for them. But Democrats are far more likely than Republicans to get election news from all of the other news outlets mentioned in the survey. For instance, about twice as many Democrats (72%) as Republicans (35%) say CNN is at least a minor source of political and election news for them.\n\nJump to more on Americans\u2019 sources of election news.\n\nRatings of the news media\u2019s election coverage differ by party\n\nThere also are huge partisan differences in opinions on how well the news media have done covering the 2024 presidential election.\n\nOverall, more than half of U.S. adults say the media have done very (13%) or somewhat (45%) well covering the election, similar to the share who said the same in 2020. But Democrats are about twice as likely as Republicans to hold this opinion (77% vs. 39%).\n\nWithin each party, these perceptions differ by age. While younger Democrats are less likely than older Democrats to give the media positive marks on their 2024 election coverage, the opposite is true among Republicans. Younger Republicans are somewhat more likely than their older GOP counterparts to say the media are doing at least somewhat well.\n\nPeople across all political and age groups are more likely to say the news sources they turn to most often are doing well covering the election than to say the same about the news media in general.\n\nJump to more on how Americans feel about election news.",

        "summary": " The Vanderbilt Project on Unity and American Democracy conducted a national survey between Sept. 20 and Sept. 23 . Only 10 percent of Americans don\u2019t believe our democracy is in danger, and slightly over 50 percent think it is \u201cunder attack\u201d The rest of the country felt our system was being \u201ctested\u201d",
        "text": "Unity Poll: Supermajority reports confidence that their vote will be counted, gains confidence in elections across U.S.\nThe Vanderbilt Project on Unity and American Democracy conducted a national survey between Sept. 20 and Sept. 23, examining crucial issues at the heart of our democratic process and the 2024 elections: confidence in the accuracy of vote counting, worries about democracy and freedom, and the impact of the vice presidential candidates on the ticket.\n\nAccording to this poll, only 10 percent of Americans don\u2019t believe our democracy is in danger, and slightly over 50 percent think it is \u201cunder attack.\u201d The rest of the country felt our system was being \u201ctested.\u201d When asked, instead, about \u201cpersonal freedom,\u201d a similar pattern emerged. In short, there is widespread concern about the state of democracy and personal freedom\u2014themes that have certainly played out on the campaign trail for Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump.\n\nVote integrity has become a consequential issue, as Trump frequently questions the accuracy of election results. The Unity Poll sought to gauge if the public is more worried about overall vote counts or whether their individual vote will be counted. People tend to have more faith in their local officials than in politicians in general, and this survey reflected similar results: Over 60 percent of respondents were at least somewhat confident that \u201cvotes nationwide\u201d are being counted accurately. However, when asked instead if \u201cyour vote\u201d is being counted correctly, that confidence rises to 71 percent.\n\nWhile vice presidential nominees do not tend to matter much in presidential elections, political discourse has swirled recently around the potential impact of vice presidential candidates Tim Walz and JD Vance on the 2024 presidential tickets. any have speculated that Vance\u2019s unpopularity was a problem for Trump, but there is little data to test such an idea.\n\nThe Unity Poll assessed whether mentioning the VP picks when asking about the public\u2019s support for Harris and Trump affected the candidates they said they would vote for. The data indicates that neither Vance nor Walz impacts the overall vote. The bottom line in the Unity Poll is that Harris holds a modest two- to three-point lead nationally over Trump, regardless of whether Vance and Walz are mentioned.\n\nThe Vanderbilt Project on Unity and American Democracy also sponsors the Vanderbilt Unity Index. \u201cThe Vanderbilt Unity Poll should provide regular snapshots of Americans\u2019 sense of national political unity and their faith in the country\u2019s democratic institutions,\u201d said John Geer, head of the Vanderbilt Project on Unity and American Democracy.\n\nSSRS conducted the Vanderbilt Unity Poll on its Opinion Panel Omnibus Platform. Between Sept. 20 and Sept. 23, 2024, 1,030 people across the nation, age 18 and older, responded across several platforms in Spanish and English. The poll has a margin of error of +/-3.8 at the 95% confidence level.",

        "text": "Presidential election FAQ: Answers to teens\u2019 most common questions\nChalkbeat and \u200b\u200bHeadway received more than 500 questions from teens about this year\u2019s presidential election. Here are their most frequently asked questions \u2014 and our answers.\n\nThis is republished as part of a series in collaboration with the Headway Election Challenge. Chalkbeat and Headway at The New York Times will ask young people to share their insights and perspectives throughout the 2024 presidential election.\n\nThroughout 2024, Headway and Chalkbeat, a nonprofit news organization focused on education in America, have been in conversation with teenagers about the upcoming presidential election.\n\nWe\u2019ve asked these teenagers some big questions: How are you engaging with the election? Why are you engaged, or why not? What issues matter to you? So far, we\u2019ve heard from a broad range of students, from self-described political junkies to those more hesitant or uninvolved. In total, we\u2019ve exchanged messages with nearly 1,500 students nationwide.\n\nWith each questionnaire, we also invited students to ask us their own questions about the election. Here\u2019s a synthesis of what we\u2019ve heard from them.\n\nWhat are the candidates\u2019 policies?\n\nThe two major candidates, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald J. Trump, have very different records and plans. Maggie Astor, a New York Times reporter covering the election, contacted both candidates\u2019 campaigns and reviewed hundreds of interviews, statements, policy papers, bills, and agency actions to build a guide to each candidate\u2019s key policies.\n\nThe guide outlines both Trump\u2019s and Harris\u2019 stances on major issues like abortion, climate change, crime, democracy, the economy, foreign policy, immigration, and the Israel-Gaza conflict. Check it out here, and save the link, as more topics will be added in the coming weeks.\n\nHow does the electoral process work?\n\nWhile the specifics of what happens during an election cycle may vary, the overall electoral process \u2014 the steps candidates, campaigns, and voters take to prepare for and participate in Election Day \u2014 tends to follow a set order.\n\nFirst, individuals interested in running for president officially declare their candidacy. Campaigning can begin years before Election Day. These candidates, who aren\u2019t yet official nominees of any political party, campaign by holding town halls and rallies, competing at debates and doing interviews with news outlets. Eventually, the process leads to the primaries and caucuses, where voters select their preferred party\u2019s nominee. These primaries and caucuses occur on the state level, with each state having its own schedule and rules.\n\nFour years ago, Times journalists Sarah Almukhtar, Matt Flegenheimer, Umi Syam, and Eden Weingart created a guide to help readers navigate the intricacies of the 2020 presidential election\u2019s primaries and caucuses. Their definitions remain relevant today:\n\nPrimaries are reasonably straightforward: Voters vote, and their votes go to candidates who hope to receive more votes than the other candidates.\n\nCaucuses are like this in spirit, but with a dash of municipal sausage-making and D.M.V.-style chaos.\n\nGenerally, supporters for various candidates sit or stand together in groups. A head count is conducted. And if a candidate doesn\u2019t reach a certain threshold of support \u2014 say, 15 percent of attendees at a caucus site \u2014 the group is deemed \u201cnonviable,\u201d and its members realign with other clusters before a final count is made.\n\nAfter the votes from the primaries and caucuses are tallied, each party coalesces around the winning candidate. Next, the candidates announce their vice-presidential running mates. Finally, the candidates head to their respective party\u2019s national convention, where they are formally nominated by the party\u2019s state delegates.\n\nThe conventions themselves are multi-day events full of speeches and presentations, nearly all focused on telling the story of the campaign to a national audience. More than 200,000 words were spoken at this year\u2019s Democratic National Convention and Republican National Convention combined. The Times reporter Jonathan Corum analyzed all those words, which you can check here.\n\nAs Election Day approaches, the presidential candidates continue to persuade voters through more debates, speeches, rallies, and media interviews. In many states, eligible voters can vote early.\n\nIn this year\u2019s election, early voting has already begun in many states, and voter registration deadlines have begun to pass in some. Here\u2019s a full guide to the key dates in each state. (We also received a lot of questions about how results are counted, which you can read about here.)\n\nOnce voting concludes, the ballots are counted in each state. This is where the Electoral College comes into play. In almost every state, the candidate who wins the most votes secures all of the state\u2019s electoral votes. (Maine and Nebraska allocate some of their electoral votes by congressional district). There are 538 total electoral votes, and the candidate who earns at least 270 is declared president-elect. The president-elect officially takes office at noon on Inauguration Day, which is usually on Jan. 20.\n\nWhy do we still use the Electoral College?\n\nThe Electoral College was a clear point of confusion for teenagers. In 2016, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote but still lost the election to Donald Trump because she lost the Electoral College. Teenagers wondered why this system remains a part of our electoral process.\n\nIn 2022, The New York Times published a comprehensive guide to the Electoral College. In this guide, the Times fellow Allyson Waller explained that although a majority of the public supports the Electoral College\u2019s abolition, it remains politically contentious \u201csince Republicans currently benefit from the electoral clout of less populous, rural states.\u201d\n\nShe continues:\n\nIn 2020, Gallup reported that 61 percent of Americans supported abolishing the Electoral College in favor of the popular vote. However, that support diverges widely based on political parties, with support from 89 percent of Democrats and only 23 percent of Republicans.\n\nOne route to changing the system would be a constitutional amendment, which would require two-thirds approval from both the House and Senate and ratification by the states, or a constitutional convention called by two-thirds of the state legislatures.\n\nSome hope to reduce the Electoral College\u2019s importance without an amendment. Fifteen states and the District of Columbia, which together control 195 electoral votes, have signed on to an interstate compact in which they pledge to grant their votes to the winner of the national popular vote. The local laws would take effect only once the compact has enough states to total 270 electoral votes.\n\nIf you want to dive deeper into what fake electors are, how many electoral votes it takes to win, or if there could ever be a tie, you can read more here.\n\nFor this year\u2019s election, Times journalists Lily Boyce, Jon Huang, and Blacki Migliozzi created an interactive that allows you to game out how Harris or Trump could reach 270 electoral votes, depending on which swing states they win. You can play that here.\n\nHow do polls work, and can we trust them?\n\nMany teenagers had questions about polls. Times reporter Kaleigh Rogers broke down how election polling works here. If you\u2019re short on time, she also explains it in a video. Here\u2019s the gist:\n\nThe golden rule: Never put too much stock in a single poll. Remember that polls are a snapshot of how people were feeling at a particular moment in time; they are subject to error and are best understood in aggregate, such as through New York Times polling averages.\n\nBut when you do want to understand more about a single poll, consider the so-called P.S.T. No, not Pacific Standard Time \u2014 take a look at the pollster that conducted the poll, the sample population surveyed, and the time frame in which it was conducted.\n\nNow that you\u2019ve been introduced to the importance of considering a survey\u2019s pollster, sample, and time frame, you can read Rogers\u2019 explanation for each of these terms in clear, easy-to-understand detail here.\n\nHow can I tell if the information I\u2019m consuming is accurate and unbiased?\n\nIn 2022, Times technology reporter Tiffany Hsu explored how teachers are helping students navigate a media landscape littered with misinformation. The article touched on a number of strategies that teachers and students can employ to improve their ability to find verified facts and mitigate bias.\n\nA New York Times Opinion article about misinformation by Charlie Warzel \u2014 later incorporated into a lesson plan from The New York Times Learning Network \u2014 argued that consuming accurate and unbiased information requires going beyond a single source. One teacher encourages students to remember the acronym SIFT:\n\n1. Stop.\n\n2. Investigate the source.\n\n3. Find better coverage.\n\n4. Trace claims, quotes, and media to the original context.\n\nYou can find more resources here in the lesson plan from The New York Times Learning Network.\n\nHow are election results counted?\n\nThere are two main types of ballots counted during an election: in-person ballots cast at polling stations on Election Day, and absentee or mail-in ballots, which voters submit either by mail or by hand before Election Day.\n\nFor in-person voting on or before Election Day, voters go to designated polling places and fill out ballots.\n\nAbsentee or mail-in ballots, which in this election are starting to go out, are becoming more popular among voters. There are state-specific rules for when they should be returned \u2014 you can see your state\u2019s deadlines for registration and voting here.\n\nAt the close of voting on Election Day, all ballots are sent to state authorities for official counting. Each state has established procedures for processing in-person, absentee, and mail-in ballots. After all votes are tallied and certified, the state\u2019s overall result determines which candidate receives its electoral votes. Once a candidate reaches 270 electoral votes, he or she wins the presidency. The results are then formally sent to Congress, concluding the election process.\n\nIn 2024, for the second presidential election in a row, we may not know the winner until days after Election Day. One of those reasons is the rise in popularity of mail-in voting. In an article about mail-in ballot delays, Times reporter Nick Corasaniti explains why:\n\nCounting mail ballots takes more time because there are more steps involved. A variety of security measures, including signature verification and ensuring that voters did not also try to vote in person, are required. Election officials must open the ballots and flatten them before they can be put in a tabulator to be counted.\n\nCorasaniti adds: \u201cIf a winner is not declared on election night, it will not necessarily point to failures in the process. More likely, it will be a result of the intense security measures required for counting mail-in ballots.\u201d\n\nIn 2020, it took two weeks before every state was called. New York Times reporters Alicia Parlapiano and Lazaro Gamio explained how and why that happened here.\n\nStarting on election night, you can follow along with The New York Times as we process the 2024 election results reported by each state.\n\nHow do candidates finance their campaigns?\n\nCandidates finance their campaigns through a combination of donations from individuals, joint fundraising committees, political action committees (PACs), and super PACs. Each of these fundraising mechanisms has its own rules and contribution limits. Candidates may also lend personal funds directly to their campaigns. They can also receive large donations from wealthy individuals and organizations through super PACs, which can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money as long as they do not coordinate directly with the candidate.\n\nIn 2023, Times journalists Molly Cook Escobar, Rachel Shorey, Charlie Smart, and Christine Zhang examined the sources of funding for the 2024 presidential candidates. Although the article was published before Trump secured the Republican nomination and Harris became the Democratic presidential nominee after President Biden\u2019s withdrawal, it provides a clear explanation of how campaigns are financed.\n\nWhat is the role of foreign interference in this election?\n\nAccording to U.S. officials, Russia, Iran, and China have all engaged in disinformation campaigns, cyberattacks, and influence operations targeting U.S. elections. These efforts are an attempt to undermine public confidence in the U.S. electoral process, create discord, and sway public opinion. In the article \u201cCrunchtime for Election Interference: October Is the Month of Mischief,\u201d Times reporters David E. Sanger and Julian E. Barnes report that U.S. officials identify Russia as the most active threat, followed by Iran and China. To counter these efforts, U.S. officials have ramped up measures to protect election systems, especially against hacking and misinformation.\n\nThe scenarios that worry American officials are legion. While the actual balloting processes being used on Nov. 5 seem safer than in previous elections \u2014 97 percent of votes cast will involve some form of paper backup that makes recounts far more reliable \u2014 federal officials have been war-gaming the possibility that registration systems become locked up, perhaps in what may initially look like the kind of ransomware attacks that have closed down city services in Baltimore or Atlanta, or hit the Seattle airport.\n\nBut why are foreign agents interfering? Jen Easterly, the head of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, told Sanger and Barnes that these agents have common goals.\n\n\u201cThe two main goals are to undermine American confidence in the security of our election and our democratic institutions and to sow partisan discord,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cThose are the two goals of all our foreign adversaries.\u201d\n\nYou can read more about this issue here.\n\nWhat is the significance of swing states in this election?\n\nThe significance of the most competitive states in any close presidential election is monumental. Appropriately named, swing states are states with close polling and enough Electoral College votes to swing the election to one candidate or another. Swing states are again the main focus this year as Harris and Trump are essentially tied in the polls.\n\nPolls suggest that the presidential contest this year hinges on the results in seven states in particular: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. To explore how each of these states may influence the election, check this swing state tracker from Times journalists Lily Boyce, Lazaro Gamio, Eli Murray, and Alicia Parlapiano.\n\nWhy are third-party candidates not more prominent?\n\nThird-party candidates face significant challenges in gaining national traction in the winner-take-all system of U.S. politics, although some are competitive in state and local races. Restrictive ballot access laws, legal opposition from major parties, and concerns about vote-splitting limit their influence. In an article headlined \u201cDemocrats Prepare Aggressive Counter to Third-Party Threats,\u201d Times reporter Rebecca Davis O\u2019Brien touched on third-party candidates. She wrote:\n\nGaining access to the presidential ballot is a complicated and expensive process for candidates, particularly for those not affiliated with a party, even a minor one. Laws vary from state to state, with some requiring merely a fee or a few thousand signatures, and others requiring tens of thousands of signatures gathered under tight deadline pressure, along with other administrative hurdles.\n\nState rules limiting ballot access \u201censure that the people who are on the ballot have legitimate bases of support, and it\u2019s not simply a vanity project,\u201d said Robert Lenhard, a Democratic Party lawyer who co-led an effort to fight against third-party candidates.\n\nIndependent candidates and third-party leadership see restrictive ballot laws, and efforts to monitor and enforce them, as anti-democratic, exemplifying the kind of two-party political machinations they say they are trying to combat.\n\n\u201cWhat are ballot access barriers? They are barriers against free speech,\u201d said Ralph Nader, who has made four third-party runs for president. He described state ballot laws in the United States as \u201cthe worst in the Western world, by orders of magnitude.\u201d\n\nEfforts to reform the system, such as switching to proportional representation, face political and structural challenges. Times journalists Alyce McFadden, Taylor Robinson, Leanne Abraham, and Rebecca Davis O\u2019Brien are tracking where third-party candidates are on the ballot here.\n\nFor a snapshot of third-party involvement in U.S. presidential elections, Darcy Eveleigh wrote a brief history in 2016 for The Upshot, detailing major third-party candidates and their eventual outcomes. And if you\u2019re weighing a vote for a third-party candidate on your own ballot, the Ethicist column in The New York Times Magazine offered some considerations here.\n\nWhat other election-related questions do you have?

Although the data is mixed about the influence of political conditions on Supreme Court retirements, Northeastern legal scholars say that there is an element of strategy. Members of the Supreme Court sit for a group portrait in Washington, Oct. 7, 2022. AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite\n\nThe new Supreme Court term is getting underway less than a month before Election Day.\n\nAnd anytime a presidential election nears, talk of retirements on the court grows.\n\nFormer Justice Stephen Breyer, who was one of three liberal members, was the last to retire in 2022. He was 83 at the time.\n\nHis retirement allowed President Joe Biden to appoint Ketanji Brown Jackson, who became the first Black woman to serve in the lifetime role.\n\nAlthough the data is mixed about the influence of politics on the decision to retire, Northeastern legal scholars say that there is an element of strategy that takes into account existing and future political conditions that would dictate succession planning for a seat on the Supreme Court.\n\nDaniel Urman, Director of hybrid and online programs in the School of Law, and director of the Law and Public Policy minor poses for a portrait. Photo by Matthew Modoono/Northeastern University Northeastern University Professor of Law Jeremy Paul.

Paul, a professor of law and former dean of the Northeastern University School of Law, right. Photos by Matthew Modoono/Northeastern University and Alyssa Stone/Northeastern University\n\n\u201cIf you look at recent retirements like Breyer and [Anthony] Kennedy and [John Paul] Stevens and [David] Souter \u2014 it\u2019s pretty clear they cared about the party nominating their successor,\u201d says Dan Urman, director of the law and public policy minor at Northeastern, who teaches courses on the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cWe are dealing with small numbers, of course \u2014 there have only been 116 justices,\u201d Urman says.\n\nOf course, if you\u2019re a Supreme Court justice, you\u2019d be hard pressed to ignore the pressure to step aside when an opportunity presents itself, Urman says. Prior to Biden\u2019s exit from the presidential race in July, calls for Justices Sonia Sotomayor or Elena Kagan (70 and 64, respectively) to get their affairs in order began to trickle in at the prospect of a second Trump presidency. Sotomayor, in particular, has reportedly been dealing with health issues linked to her diabetes.\n\nWith Vice President Kamala Harris at the head of the ticket, those calls seem to have quieted. But in an era of intense political polarization, the pressure to hang around or call it quits takes on new meaning, says Jeremy R. Paul, a professor of law and former dean of the Northeastern University School of Law.\n\nPaul says the growing politicization of the court \u2014 around the politicking that surrounds it \u2014 has raised the stakes of court retirements.\n\nRumors have swirled around the potential retirements of Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, who are 76 and 74, respectively, for some time.\n\nNortheastern Global News, in your inbox. Sign up for NGN\u2019s daily newsletter for news, discovery and analysis from around the world.\n\n\u201cIf Trump wins, it\u2019s very likely that both [Clarence] Thomas and [Samuel] Alito will retire during his term,\u201d Paul says. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t imagine a scenario where Trump wins and the Republicans don\u2019t also have the Senate,\u201d which would make the matter of installing successors a formality.\n\nOn the flip side, if Harris wins in November, Paul says the pair of conservative justices may try to hold out until 2028. And they may even try to do so, Urman notes, if Trump is elected: \u201cI think Alito and Thomas would want to stick it to their critics and not give them the satisfaction of having them off the court.\u201d\n\nAnd if Harris wins, public pressure may swing in the opposite direction: \u201cSotomayor is 70, and would likely retire, or be urged to retire,\u201d Urman says.\n\nThe same critics who were calling for Sotormayor\u2019s retirement months ago point to the case of former Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died during Trump\u2019s first term at age 87. She was swiftly succeeded by Justice Amy Coney Barrett.\n\nBut just as many observers, it seemed, pushed back against a purely political calculus then.\n\n\u201cRuth Bader Ginsburg made a choice that turned out wrong,\u201d writes New York Magazine reporter Rebecca Traister. \u201cShe wanted to keep doing the work she loved and was good at and that mattered; she didn\u2019t want to stop before she was ready. Like so many others, she believed Hillary Clinton would likely win in 2016. And like so many others, she was wrong about that.\u201d",

Data collected on these early votes offers a valuable, real-time glimpse into the contest between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. It can be used to gauge voter enthusiasm and turnout, particularly in hotly contested battleground states, according to political experts. However, they caution that it shouldn\u2019t be used to make broad predictions about the final outcome.\n\nEarly voting has begun in at least thirty-seven states and Washington, D.C., according to the New York Times. Among them are several key swing states, including Pennsylvania, Michigan and Georgia. In these states, upwards of 48 million ballots have been requested so far, with more registered Democrats requesting them than registered Republicans, per the outlet. Further, about 2.5 million in-person and mail-in ballots have already been cast, according to NBC News.\n\nRead more on Merced Sun-Star.",

(Nicole Evatt via AP)\n\nOn an Aleutian island closer to the Russian border than mainland Alaska and more than 4,000 miles from the White House, the question isn\u2019t who wins on Election Day. It\u2019s who will be the very last American to vote. \u201cPeople have a little bit of fun on that day, because, I mean, realistically everybody knows the election\u2019s decided way before we\u2019re closed,\u201d said Layton Lockett, the city manager in Adak, Alaska. The country\u2019s last polling place to close is the only one still open from midnight ET to 1 a.m., when things wrap up on the island and former World War II military base. The honor of being the last voter was Mary Nelson\u2019s in 2012, when the community of a few hundred people did away with early voting in favor of casting ballots in person. She was a poll worker that Election Day, too, meaning her historic moment was short lived. \u201cWhen I opened the curtain to come back out, the city manager took my picture \u2026 and they were waiting for us in Nome to call with our vote count,\u201d she said.\n\nNo. 7: Nash County, North Carolina The Nash County Courthouse is in Nashville, N.C.

Robertson)\n\nOut of more than 500 counties in the seven battleground states in this year\u2019s election, only 10 voted for Trump in 2016 before flipping to Biden in 2020. The first to complete its count this Election Day ought to be North Carolina\u2019s Nash County, which by 10 p.m. ET could provide an early indication of which candidate is performing best among the swing voters likely to decide a closely contested White House. That\u2019s especially true should there be a decisive winner in the community northeast of Raleigh, unaffected by Hurricane Helene. Two decades have passed since any presidential candidate won Nash by more than a point. Confirmation won\u2019t come for hours (or days), but more intelligence will arrive about a half hour later when North Carolina\u2019s other Trump-Biden county \u2014 New Hanover on the state\u2019s Atlantic Coast \u2014 should wrap up its count. The other eight counties to watch: Erie and Northampton in Pennsylvania; Maricopa in Arizona; Kent, Saginaw and Leelanau in Michigan and Sauk and Door in Wisconsin.\n\nNo. 8: Apache County, Arizona Jay Begay moves his flock of sheep on horseback near his home in the Navajo Nation in Arizona.

Weaver IV) First lady Jill Biden speaks during a live radio address to the Navajo Nation at the Window Rock Navajo Tribal Park & Veterans Memorial in Window Rock, Ariz.(Mandel Ngan/Pool via AP)\n\nThere\u2019s more to Arizona than Maricopa County. Seriously! Yes, it\u2019s true that Biden eked out a win in 2020 among the more than 60% of Arizona voters who live in the sprawling home of Phoenix and its suburbs. But Biden may not have won Arizona and its 11 electoral votes without his win in Apache County, where he beat Trump by 11,851 votes out of roughly 35,000 cast. His statewide margin? Just 10,457. Apache County is far from the typical Democratic urban stronghold. Much of the rural county is part of the Navajo Nation, and it also includes lands belonging to the Apache people who gave the county its name. In all, more than 70% of people living there are Native American. America\u2019s indigenous population is often overlooked in presidential elections: the states with the largest percentages of Native people \u2013 Alaska, New Mexico, Oklahoma and South Dakota \u2013 are not often competitive. Arizona\u2019s emergence as a battleground makes the voters in Apache County \u2014 and the roughly 5% of Arizonans who are Native American \u2014 a potential factor in this year\u2019s election.\n\nNo. 9: Milwaukee, Wisconsin Buildings stand in the Milwaukee skyline in Milwaukee.

(AP Photo/Julia Nikhinson)\n\nTrump won Wisconsin by about 20,000 votes in 2016 \u2013 and he and the country had to wait on Milwaukee County to know which way that margin would fall. The state\u2019s largest county and Democratic stronghold is one of a handful in Wisconsin that releases results of mail ballots all at once, rather than combining them with other ballots counted at precinct polling places. In 2016, confirmation there weren't enough mail votes left to count in the City of Milwaukee to flip the race from Trump to Hillary Clinton allowed AP to declare the Republican the winner of the state \u2013 and the White House. In the 2022 midterms, it was only when AP confirmed there were no ballots remaining to be counted in Milwaukee and Dane County, Wisconsin\u2019s other largest source of Democratic votes, that it was able to say incumbent Republican Ron Johnson would return to the Senate. Milwaukee might not be among the final counties in Wisconsin to report its results this year, but don\u2019t count out its chances to be the decisive county once it does in this crucial battleground state.\n\nNo. 10: Drop boxes A person puts their ballot in a drop box at a library in Seattle's White Center neighborhood.

(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) A ballot drop box is seen in Sherwood, Ore. (AP Photo/Jenny Kane)\n\nElection officials nationwide found no cases of fraud, vandalism or theft related to the use of drop boxes that that could have affected the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. And yet no place in this year\u2019s election may face more scrutiny than the drop box \u2013 a tool designed to make voting easier that\u2019s become the source of conspiracy theories that they played a role (they didn\u2019t) in stealing the election from Trump (it wasn\u2019t). Several states have enacted laws restricting their use since 2020, while in others they remain the subject of fascination. The Wisconsin Supreme Court reversed itself in July and dumped a ruling that limited drop boxes to only election clerks\u2019 offices. Prosecutors are currently investigating the removal of Wausau\u2019s drop box last month by the mayor without consulting with the city clerk. Election officials typically have detailed processes to ensure the security of ballots left in drop boxes, which are often monitored remotely by camera. Still, drop boxes remain a place where opponents wrongly believe their vote is neither safe nor secure.",

With tight polling margins in these states, each holding significant electoral votes , the race remains highly competitive, reflecting the ever-changing dynamics of voter preferences across the country.Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin are critical battleground states in the upcoming 2024 US presidential election, with each state having unique political dynamics and issues that have shaped the race in recent years. A quick glance at current polling averages and past electoral results highlights the shifting nature of voter sentiment in these key states.Arizona, with its 11 electoral votes, remains at the heart of immigration debates, particularly around border security. The Latino vote has become increasingly influential, reflecting the state's growing demographic shifts. In 2016, Arizona narrowly went to Trump, but Biden flipped it in 2020, making it a critical battleground for 2024. Polling averages from FiveThirtyEight currently show Trump with a slight lead of +1.4 in the state.Georgia, with 16 electoral votes, has been a flashpoint for voting rights and election integrity discussions. The mobilisation of Black voters in the state has been pivotal, and Biden's unexpected victory in 2020 after Trump's win in 2016 brought renewed attention to Georgia\u2019s shifting political landscape. For 2024, the polls suggest another close race, with Trump holding a narrow +1.0 advantage.In Michigan, where 15 electoral votes are up for grabs, economic concerns dominate the conversation, particularly around manufacturing and the auto industry. The state saw Trump win by a slim margin in 2016, only for Biden to reclaim it in 2020. Present polling averages show a slight edge for Harris at +1.0.Nevada, home to 6 electoral votes, faces key discussions around its economy, which has been heavily reliant on tourism. Post-pandemic recovery, healthcare, and immigration are significant topics here. Clinton won Nevada by a narrow margin in 2016, and Biden retained it in 2020. The latest polling indicates a close race with Harris leading by +0.8.In North Carolina, which carries 16 electoral votes, the ongoing debates around healthcare, education, and suburban voter preferences continue to keep the state competitive. Trump won North Carolina in both 2016 and 2020, but Democrats see potential for gains in 2024. Currently, Trump leads in the polls by +1.0.Pennsylvania, with its 19 electoral votes, remains a pivotal state, where energy policies, particularly around fracking, are a key issue. The state swung from Trump in 2016 to Biden in 2020, largely due to its mix of urban and rural voters. Polling averages show Harris holding a slight lead of +0.8 in the state as of now.Wisconsin, with 10 electoral votes, is another battleground characterised by its rural versus urban political divide and concerns over manufacturing job losses. Trump narrowly won here in 2016, but Biden flipped the state in 2020. Current polling has Harris leading by +0.8.On the national stage, FiveThirtyEight polling averages show Harris with a modest lead of +2.5, but these battleground states will ultimately play a decisive role in shaping the 2024 outcome. With many of these states experiencing tight polling margins, the race remains too close to call, and the issues driving each state's electorate will likely determine the eventual winner.",

And that means ballots for those voters will look different this fall.\n\nRanked-choice voting allows voters to rank candidates in order of preference instead of choosing only one candidate. This method allows someone\u2019s vote to count toward another candidate if their favorite candidate is eliminated. Portland voters will be able to rank up to six candidates.\n\nMultnomah County Elections has released both a video and resources website explaining the basics of ranked-choice voting.\n\nTo learn more about ranked-choice voting in upcoming City of Portland elections, visit www.portland.gov/vote.\n\nVoting Center Express in Gresham open beginning Oct. 10\n\nMultnomah County Elections will open its second service location, the Voting Center Express in Gresham, starting today, Thursday, Oct. 10, through Election Day, Nov. 5.

While there are stark differences between the Trump and Biden administrations, they have more common ground on steel trade and tariffs than many would think.

        "text": "Back-to-back hurricanes reshape 2024 campaign\u2019s final stretch\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A pair of unwelcome and destructive guests named Helene and Milton have stormed their way into this year\u2019s presidential election.\n\nThe back-to-back hurricanes have jumbled the schedules of Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump, both of whom devoted part of their recent days to tackling questions about the storm recovery effort.\n\nThe two hurricanes are forcing basic questions about who as president would best respond to deadly natural disasters, a once-overlooked issue that has become an increasingly routine part of the job. And just weeks before the Nov. 5 election, the storms have disrupted the mechanics of voting in several key counties.\n\nVice President Harris is trying to use this as an opportunity to project leadership, appearing alongside President Joe Biden at briefings and calling for bipartisan cooperation. Former President Trump is trying to use the moment to attack the administration\u2019s competence and question whether it is withholding help from Republican areas, despite no evidence of such behavior.\n\nAdding to the pressure is the need to provide more money for the Small Business Administration and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which would require House Republicans to work with the Democratic administration. Biden said Friday that Hurricane Milton alone had caused $50 billion in estimated damages.\n\n\u201cDealing with back-to-back crises will put FEMA under more scrutiny and, therefore, the Biden administration will be under a microscope in the days leading up to the election,\u201d said Timothy Kneeland, a professor at Nazareth University in Rochester, New York, who has studied the issue.\n\nWhat to know about Trump\u2019s second term:\n\nStaffing the administration: Here are the people Trump has picked recess appointments Follow all of our coverage as Donald Trump assembles his second administration.\n\n\u201cVice President Harris must empathize with the victims without altering the campaign schedule and provide consistent messaging on the widespread devastation that makes FEMA\u2019s work even more challenging than normal,\u201d Kneeland added.\n\nAlready, Trump and Harris have separately gone to Georgia and North Carolina to assess hurricane damage and pledge support, requiring the candidates to cancel campaign events elsewhere and use up time that is a precious resource in the final weeks before any election. Both Georgia and North Carolina are political battlegrounds, raising the stakes.\n\nThe hurricane fallout is evident in the candidates\u2019 campaign events as well.\n\nOn Thursday, the first question Harris got at a Univision town hall in Las Vegas came from a construction worker and undecided voter from Tampa, Florida. Ramiro Gonzalez asked about talk that the administration has not done enough to support people after Helene and whether the people in Milton\u2019s path would have access to aid \u2014 a sign that Trump\u2019s messaging is breaking through with some potential voters.\n\nHarris has called out the level of misinformation being circulated by Republicans, but her fuller answer revealed the dynamics at play just a few weeks before an election.\n\n\u201cI have to stress that this is not a time for people to play politics,\u201d she said.\n\nOn the same day, Trump opened his speech at the Detroit Economic Club by praising Republican governors in the affected states and blasting the Biden-Harris administration.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve let those people suffer unjustly,\u201d he said about those affected by Helene in North Carolina.\n\nThe storms have also scrambled the voting process in places. North Carolina\u2019s legislature passed and Gov. Roy Cooper signed this week a law that helps people in 25 affected counties with more ways to vote. Florida will allow some counties greater flexibility in distributing mail-in ballots and changing polling sites for in-person voting. But a federal judge in Georgia said Thursday the state doesn\u2019t need to reopen voter registration despite the disruptions by Helene.\n\nTension and controversy have begun to override the disaster response, with Biden on Wednesday and Thursday saying that Trump has spread falsehoods that are \u201cun-American.\u201d\n\nCandace Bright Hall-Wurst, a sociology professor at East Tennessee State University, said that natural disasters have become increasingly politicized, often putting more of the focus on the politicians instead of the people in need.\n\n\u201cDisasters are politicized when they have political value to the candidate,\u201d she said. \u201cThis does not mean that the politicization is beneficial to victims.\u201d\n\nAs the Democratic nominee, Harris has suddenly been a major part of the response to hurricanes, a role that traditionally has not involved vice presidents in prior administrations.\n\nOn Thursday, she participated virtually at a Situation Room briefing on Milton while she was in Nevada for campaign activities. She has huddled in meetings about response plans and on Wednesday phoned into CNN live to discuss the administration\u2019s efforts.\n\nAt a Friday briefing with Biden to discuss the hurricanes, Harris repeated a message that subtly ties back into her campaign policies to stop price gouging.\n\n\u201cTo any company or individual that is using this crisis to jack up prices through illegal fraud or price gouging, whether it be at the gas pump, the airport or the hotel counter, we will be monitoring and there will be a consequence,\u201d Harris said.\n\nHer newfound importance was such that Biden was nudged to wrap up his remarks so she could speak, prompting him to joke, \u201cShe\u2019s my boss here.\u201d\n\nHurricane Milton made landfall in Florida late Wednesday and left more than 3 million without power. But the storm surge never reached the same levels as Helene, which led to roughly 230 fatalities and for a prolonged period left parts of North Carolina without access to electricity, cell service and roadways.\n\nTrump and his allies have seized on the aftermath of Helene to spread misinformation about the administration\u2019s response. Their debunked claims include statements that victims can only receive $750 in aid as well as false charges that emergency response funds were diverted to immigrants.\n\nThe former president said the administration\u2019s response to Helene was worse than the George W. Bush administration\u2019s widely panned handling of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which led to nearly 1,400 deaths.\n\n\u201cThis hurricane has been a bad one, Kamala Harris has left them stranded,\u201d Trump said at a recent rally in Juneau, Wisconsin. \u201cThis is the worst response to a storm or a catastrophe or a hurricane that we\u2019ve ever seen ever. Probably worse than Katrina, and that\u2019s hard to beat, right?\u201d\n\nAsked about the Trump campaign\u2019s strategic thinking on emphasizing the hurricane response, campaign press secretary Karoline Leavitt said it reflects a pattern of \u201cfailed leadership\u201d by the Biden-Harris administration that also includes the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan and security at the U.S. southern border.\n\n\u201cKamala has left Americans behind and proven she is not equipped to solve crises at the highest level,\u201d Leavitt said.\n\nJohn Gasper, a Carnegie Mellon University professor who has researched government responses to natural disasters, said storm victims generally want to ensure foremost that they get the aid they need.\n\n\u201cThese disasters essentially end up being good tests of leadership for local, state and federal officials in how they respond,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Gasper noted that U.S. politics have gotten so polarized and other issues such as the economy are shaping the election, such that the debate currently generating so much heat between Trump and the Biden-Harris administration might not matter that much on Election Day.\n\n\u201cOn the margin, it will matter,\u201d he said. \u201cWill it define the election? Probably not. There\u2019s so many other things out there.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP writer Adriana Gomez Licon contributed to this report.",

The Harris campaign announced that Bill Clinton would campaign for Harris in southern battleground states, starting this weekend, while Barack Obama began his swing state tour in Pennsylvania \u2013 the battleground with the highest number of electoral college votes.\n\nAppearing at the University of Pittsburgh, Obama sought to encourage young people to get their friends and relatives to vote. He said Trump saw power \u201cas a means to an end\u201d and took aim at his \u201cconcept of a plan\u201d for healthcare.\n\n\u201cThe good news is Kamala Harris has an actual plan,\u201d Obama said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got to release the kraken,\u201d veteran Democrat campaign strategist James Carville told the New York Times, adding that the Harris campaign should be using Obama and other surrogates \u201cmore aggressively\u201d.\n\nInflation, meanwhile, weakened to its slowest pace in more than three years in September, as price growth continued to fall back from its highest levels in a generation. With concerns over the heightened cost of living at the heart of the presidential election campaign, the Bureau of Labor Statistics released its final monthly inflation reading before voters head to the polls.\n\nHere is what else happened on Thursday:",

        "summary": " Gallup poll: Forty percent of U.S. registered voters either plan to vote before Election Day or have voted already . Early voting intentions (including reports of actual early voting) have increased over the course of presidential election campaigns since 2004 . Democrats were much more likely than Republicans to say they would vote early in 2020 .",
        "text": "Four in 10 U.S. Voters Planning to Cast Ballots Early\nWASHINGTON, D.C. -- Forty percent of U.S. registered voters, as of late September, either plan to vote before Election Day or have voted already. While lower than the 2020 figures measured amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the proportion of early voters this year is the same as or higher than those captured in other recent election years.\n\nEarly voting intentions (including reports of actual early voting) have increased over the course of presidential election campaigns since 2004. These increases surpassed double digits in the 2012 and 2020 election years. Consequently, the final percentage of early voters this year could approach or exceed 50% by the end of the 2024 election campaign.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nThe latest data are based on a Sept. 16-28 Gallup poll of U.S. registered voters, completed before most Americans were able to vote early. As data from previous election cycles show, early voting intentions are not set in stone -- many voters who in September or early October are not considering voting before Election Day take advantage of opportunities to do so in the final weeks of the campaign.\n\nIn 2020, Democrats were much more likely than Republicans to say they would vote early, in contrast to prior election years when there were no meaningful partisan differences. This year, significantly more Democrats again say they plan to vote before Election Day. The current 15-percentage-point partisan gap in early voting intentions -- 46% for Democrats, 31% for Republicans -- is similar to the 18 points separating Democrats and Republicans at the end of the 2020 campaign.\n\nPolitical independents are about as likely as Democrats this year to say they plan to vote before Election Day, whereas in 2020 they were on par with Republicans\u2019 lower level. In all prior years, independents were, by a small margin, the least likely party group to vote early.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nEarly voting does confer advantages to the political parties, who can then focus their mobilization efforts nearer Election Day on turning out infrequent voters or swing voters once the votes of their reliable supporters are \u201cbanked.\u201d\n\nIn addition to political party, early voting also differs by age. A slim 51% majority of older voters, those aged 65 and older, say they will vote early this year. That compares with 41% of registered voters between the ages of 50 and 64 and 34% of voters under 50.\n\nIn-Person Voting Likely to Be Higher in 2024 Than in 2020\n\nIn addition to measuring when they will vote, Gallup asked registered voters how they plan to vote. More states have expanded vote-by-mail opportunities in recent years, and many voters are choosing to mail in their ballot rather than visit their polling place on or before Election Day.\n\nAll told, 69% of registered voters plan to cast their ballots in person this presidential election year, while 21% plan to vote by mail and 6% are unsure how they will vote. This represents a significant decrease in mail voting (35% in 2020) and an increase in in-person voting (60%) compared with four years ago.\n\nThat shift away from mail voting is apparent among all party groups, but particularly among Democrats. In 2020, Democrats were about as likely to vote by mail (47%) as to vote in person (50%). Now, the percentage of Democratic mail voters is down by 20 points, to 27%. Mail voting is also down 13 points among independents and 11 points among Republicans.\n\nRepublicans remain the group most likely to vote in person, with about three-quarters planning to do so, slightly higher than in 2020.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nOlder voters are most likely to say they will vote by mail -- 27% of those aged 65 and older say they will do so, compared with 17% of voters aged 50 to 64 and 19% of those under 50.\n\nAbout Half of U.S. Voters Plan to Vote in Person on Election Day\n\nTaking into account both when and how registered voters plan to cast their ballot, a total of 51% say they will vote in person on Election Day, by far the largest group. Early voters break about equally between those who will vote in person (18%) or by mail or absentee ballot (20%). Most of the rest are unsure how they will vote this year.\n\nIn 2020, early voters were also split about evenly between in person and mail voters.\n\nMore Republicans who plan to vote early will vote in person rather than by mail or absentee ballot, while for Democrats, more early voters will be casting absentee ballots. Close to six in 10 Republicans plan to vote in person on Election Day, while under half of Democrats and independents intend to do so.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nIn 2020, Republicans were also more inclined to vote early in person than by absentee, while Democrats were more likely to mail in their ballots rather than vote in person before Election Day.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAbout four weeks remain until Election Day, and some voters have already cast their ballots. Based on voters\u2019 intentions as of late September, the bulk of voting should take place on Election Day. But as prior years\u2019 polling has shown, many more voters will likely end up voting before Election Day than intended to do so weeks prior, and it could be the case that the majority of 2024 ballots are cast before Election Day.\n\nWhile mail voting promises to be less common than it was during the 2020 pandemic, that method is still preferred much more by Democrats than Republicans. If absentee ballot processing and counting stretches beyond Election Day, particularly in larger cities with the greatest number of voters, the ballots counted later will likely contain more votes for Democratic candidates than Republican candidates, as occurred in 2020. Those absentee votes could be enough to push Democratic candidates over the top in closely contested elections by the time all votes are counted.\n\nTo stay up to date with the latest Gallup News insights and updates, follow us on X @Gallup.\n\nLearn more about how the Gallup Poll Social Series works.\n\nView complete question responses and trends (PDF download).\n\n###Embeddable###",

        "text": "Has the Presidential Election Become a Game of Random Chance?\nI hardly ever play poker anymore, but I do spend an unhealthy amount of time watching instructional videos about the game. On some primal level, watching coaches go through each step of the thought process scratches an incurable itch; on a more intellectual level, there\u2019s been a great deal of change in strategy throughout the past twenty years and, in the same way another dad might scan the new-releases playlist on Spotify, I want to keep up. Back in the early aughts, during the height of the poker boom, the secrets of the game were both doctrinaire and vague. You were told to be \u201ctight and aggressive,\u201d not \u201cloose and passive,\u201d but there wasn\u2019t a set of instructions that corresponded with either. Today, after the introduction of what\u2019s broadly known as \u201cgame-theory optimal\u201d play, or G.T.O., a portion of what you do at a poker table has been solved. Forgive the jargon, but if you\u2019re dealt an ace and a queen\u2014a strong starting hand\u2014in the big blind, and face a mid-position open, the best strategy, according to G.T.O. poker, is to three-bet x percentage of the time and just call the other times. What this means is that you can call or raise and both options are correct, as long as, over time, they\u2019re in line with a rolling calculation of percentages. As a result, there\u2019s a Zen to the modern poker strategy, which may be why I often watch these videos late at night when I can\u2019t sleep. I especially appreciate the commentary of Phil Galfond, a personable former professional poker player, who now makes videos in which he says things like \u201cIn this spot, you can fold sometimes, call sometimes, and raise sometimes, and it\u2019s probably fine.\u201d\n\nI was thinking about Galfond recently because, in the 2024 election, which is now less than four weeks away, we have found ourselves in a blinkered version of those poker videos, where every decision probably can be justified in one way or another. Sometimes Kamala Harris should come out with a strong statement of leadership about the escalating conflict in the Middle East. Sometimes she should defer to Joe Biden. Sometimes she should do what she did this past week on \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d which was mostly to evade the question entirely. When asked what her plans were to stem the escalating war in Gaza, Harris said that October 7th was a tragedy, Israel has the right to defend itself, and far too many Palestinian civilians have died, which does not actually suggest any plan of action. And, when asked how the Biden Administration planned on reining in Israel\u2019s Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, Harris said, \u201cThe work that we do diplomatically with the leadership of Israel is an ongoing pursuit around making clear our principles.\u201d\n\nIf your only goal is to win the election, all of these options are probably fine. Perhaps taking a harder line against Netanyahu will bring back Arab American and Muslim voters, particularly in Michigan. But such a stance might lead to losses elsewhere. Of course, there could also be a cost to just repeating the same slogans again and again, even if doing so allows your positions to be defined by the sunny imaginations of voters who don\u2019t want a second Donald Trump Presidency and are, more often than not, willing to give you the benefit of the doubt.\n\nThe difference is that in poker the agnosticism over individual decisions all serves a larger plan. In this election, the uncertainty comes from an inability to actually grasp and prioritize an optimal series of choices. This seems like an impossible state of affairs for an election in which the Democratic candidate was swapped out, the Republican candidate\u2014who has now been running for a decade straight\u2014was shot in the ear during a rally, and natural disasters and wars in Europe and the Middle East threaten American security. But it\u2019s also possible that there isn\u2019t actually anything exceptional about this election, except that the peculiar, harrowing circumstances of Harris\u2019s ascent to the nomination and the static nature of Trump, both in his repulsive provocations and in the bedrock of support he receives, have made the truth about all Presidential elections a bit more obvious. We don\u2019t actually know why a whole lot of voters decide to support one candidate over another. We don\u2019t really know what will happen, say, in North Carolina, which, prior to the catastrophic damage caused by Hurricane Helene, was thought of as an emerging swing state. If the Republicans win North Carolina, we won\u2019t know if it was because of the blame game that the Republicans played in the disaster response, which included several outright lies about rerouted public-assistance funds, or if the polls were just giving the Harris campaign some moments of false hope.\n\nIn the past couple of months, I\u2019ve written about how much of the election\u2014whether the preferences of the so-called undecided voters, the polls, or the post-Convention agenda of Harris\u2014is mostly unknowable. On November 5th, when the election needle at the Times finally comes to rest, we will manufacture a bunch of reasons why Trump or Harris won, or, more likely, why one of them lost, and those narratives will either disappear within a couple of days or calcify into the prevailing political wisdom. If, for example, Harris loses Pennsylvania, you can imagine a conclusion: She should have talked more about the border instead of just reiterating the same line about the bipartisan bill over and over and over again. If Trump loses the election, the postmortems might focus on his inability to launch what should have been a laser-focussed attack on the Harris campaign\u2019s inability to lead the country in a time of international and domestic crises, her oftentimes wandering answers to direct questions, and what, up until this past week, sure seemed like a reticence to sit in front of a camera and answer difficult questions. This should have been a layup for Trump against a weak candidate. Or, perhaps, they will simply conclude that the country has finally and definitively turned away from Trump\u2019s would-be authoritarianism.\n\nBut, sadly for us pundits, there isn\u2019t a reliable way to explain the chaos of thin margins in an election involving roughly two-thirds of eligible American voters and a bizarre mechanism like the Electoral College. The commentariat seems stuck talking about the same things over and over\u2014Why doesn\u2019t she do more interviews? Why can\u2019t Trump cut down on the inflammatory language and the bizarre asides?\u2014while natural disasters keep happening at home and the bombs keep dropping abroad.\n\nIf this was just about pundits and our predictions and prescriptions, the stakes would be relatively low. But I sense that the electorate also has been wallowing in this epistemic muck since the Democratic National Convention. The coin-flip nature of the election has frozen everyone from taking too hard of a stand on anything, really. The talk about how this is the most important election in our lifetimes is now delivered, for the most part, without much conviction. In prior elections, this would be the time when there would be blanket ads about getting out the vote, for example, but, outside of Taylor Swift\u2019s endorsement on Instagram, there hasn\u2019t really been the same fervor around even something that\u2019s as seemingly anodyne as reminding people to vote. The reports of enthusiastic, overflowing crowds for Harris rallies feel like a distant memory. The coconut memes have receded.\n\nThis stasis, as unsatisfying as it might be, is not all Harris\u2019s fault. She seems to be running a campaign hell-bent on converting Republican voters, which, again, seems like a reasonable enough strategy. When asked by Stephen Colbert how she might differ from Biden, Harris pointed out that she was a different person and that, more important, she was not Trump, which was a perfect encapsulation of her campaign. She is not Biden or Trump, and maybe that\u2019s enough, even if she doesn\u2019t really explain how her policy ambitions or even temperament might lead to change.\n\nWe have seemingly reached an end point in polarization, where any new developments short of swapping out a candidate wholesale will be met with indifference in the polls. The public understands, at least subconsciously, that something must matter to voters, but only really gets evidence that most things\u2014say, Trump\u2019s convictions in court, his litany of bigoted outbursts and lies, or who wins a debate\u2014do not. How does a concerned citizen participate in such seemingly arbitrary and unknowable politics when everything has been winnowed down to the results of one election? How often do they just sit back and wait for the coin to flip? \u2666",

        "text": "Donald Trump, Kamala Harris locked in close election race: WSJ poll\nWall Street Journal study suggests Trump and Harris neck-to-neck in six key swig states before the November 5 vote.\n\nDemocratic candidate Kamala Harris and her Republican rival Donald Trump are locked in a dead heat race for the presidency in the United States less than a month before the vote, a new Wall Street Journal poll suggests.\n\nAccording to the data, published on Friday, the vice president and former president are within two percentage points of one another in six of the seven battleground states that will ultimately decide the next president.\n\nIn the poll, while Harris led in the states of Arizona, Georgia and Michigan, Trump was ahead in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, North Carolina and Nevada. All the results are within the margin of error with the exception of Nevada, where Trump is led by 5 percent in the WSJ poll.\n\nThe newspaper said it surveyed 600 registered voters per state between September 28 and October 8.\n\nUS elections are not won by popular vote nationwide. Rather, candidates compete in individual states to win electoral college votes.\n\nIt\u2019s akin to a point system, where each state is worth a number of points proportionate to the size of its population. In all but two states \u2013 Maine and Nebraska \u2013 the winner takes all the electoral college votes.\n\nMost states are almost certain to go to one party. For example, a Democratic win in California and Vermont is often projected as soon as the polls close, while states like Oklahoma and Alabama are Republican strongholds.\n\nThe battleground states\n\nThat leaves a handful of states where there are close, competitive elections. These are known as swing states. In this round, all eyes are on the seven states polled by WSJ.\n\nIn 2016, Trump won the presidency despite losing the popular vote because he defeated the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in most battleground states.\n\nAccording to a Pew Research Center survey released on Friday, Harris is leading the race nationally by one point \u2013 48 percent to Trump\u2019s 47 percent.\n\nUS election poll results have fluctuated in recent months. While Trump enjoyed a solid lead over Joe Biden earlier this year in almost all polls, the Democrats received a boost after the US president stepped aside and was replaced by Harris as the party\u2019s nominee.\n\nA Morning Consult poll in September had Harris beating Trump 51 percent to 46 percent. But the former president appeared to claw back some support amid concerns about the economy and the turmoil in the Middle East.\n\nUS election polls have also been wide off the mark in the past. For example, many surveys had indicated that Clinton was set for a comfortable win when she lost to Trump in 2016.\n\nStill, this year various polls appear to agree that the US is heading to a close presidential election next month.\n\nSenate race\n\nControl of the Senate and House of Representatives will also be up for grabs on November 5.\n\nA New York Times poll on Friday predicted bad news for Democrats\u2019 hopes of protecting their narrow majority in the Senate.\n\nThe Democrats currently control the 100-member chamber with 51 seats, including four independents who caucus with the party.\n\nBut the Times survey found that Democrats are likely to lose a potentially decisive seat in a Republican-leaning state.\n\nRepublicans were already expected to flip a Senate seat in West Virginia \u2013 where conservative Democratic incumbent Joe Manchin is not running for re-election.\n\nBut the Times poll indicated Democratic Senator Jon Tester is trailing his Republican opponent by eight percentage points in rural Montana, where Trump won with ease in 2016 and 2020.\n\nDemocrats will also have a fight on their hands to keep Senate seats in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Arizona and Nevada, but they will be hoping to challenge Republican incumbents in Texas and Florida.\n\nA Republican-controlled Senate can prove to be a major hurdle for Harris should she win in November.\n\nBeyond its legislative powers, the Senate is tasked with confirming judicial appointments and cabinet members, which would allow Republicans to pressure Harris, should she be elected, on who she chooses for her governing team.",

        "text": "Women Voters Revisited: Inflation, Abortion, and Increased Motivation in the 2024 Election Countdown\nKey Takeaways In the three months since the initial KFF Survey of Women Voters, several major unexpected political events have taken place, impacting voters\u2019 motivations and voting decisions for Election Day. This includes President Biden\u2019s announcement that he would no longer seek reelection, with Vice President Harris quickly garnering the Democratic nomination as his replacement. To better understand how these and other events have impacted campaign dynamics and how voters feel leading into the November election, KFF resurveyed women voters and finds a very different female electorate one month before Election Day. Some key takeaways from the KFF Survey of Women Voters Revisited include: Since Vice President (VP) Harris entered the 2024 presidential race, abortion has become the most important issue for women under age 30, rising in the ranks above inflation, this group\u2019s top issue from earlier this summer. Four in ten (39%) women voters under 30 now say abortion is the most important issue to their vote, doubling the share who said the same back in June. Harris\u2019 increased campaign rhetoric on reproductive rights also seems to be resonating with the Democratic base, notably younger Democratic women voters. Democratic women of reproductive age (under age 50) are now nearly twice as likely say they trust her \u201ca lot\u201d to discuss issues related to abortion (66%, up from 35% in June). Among women voters overall, Harris holds a two to one advantage over former President Trump on which candidate they trust to do a better job deciding policy related to abortion access, birth control access, and IVF.\n\nInflation continues to be the number one issue for women voters heading into this election and remains high among priorities for Black (51%) and Hispanic (41%) women. In a flip from earlier this summer, voters of color are now giving VP Harris an advantage on handling the rising costs of household expenses. Black women are seven times more likely to say they trust VP Harris (70% trust Harris, 10% trust Trump) and most Hispanic women also trust the VP (53% trust Harris, 35% trust Trump). This is a change from June, when many Black and Hispanic women said they did not trust either political party to do a better job addressing household costs and many disapproved of President Biden\u2019s handling of inflation.\n\nWomen voters, especially Democratic and Black women voters, are now more satisfied with their choices for president and more motivated to vote than they were back in June. The share of Democratic women voters who say they are satisfied with their choices for president has increased thirty-nine percentage points, as well as a thirty-point increase among Black women. In addition, majorities of both Democratic women and Black women now say they are \u201cmore motivated\u201d to vote in the upcoming election than in previous presidential elections, and many attribute this increased motivation directly to VP Harris replacing President Biden as the Democratic nominee. Republican women voters, on the other hand, who were more positive back in early summer than their Democratic counterparts, now trail behind in both candidate satisfaction and motivation to vote.\n\nIn addition to feeling more enthusiastic, a larger share of Democratic women voters now reports feeling \u201chopeful\u201d about the upcoming election, but they are also more likely to say they feel \u201canxious.\u201d Democratic women voters may be feeling increased anxiety as they are also now more likely to see the November election as having major implications on abortion access in the country.\n\nWomen voters are now 11-percentage points more likely to say that this presidential election will have a \u201cmajor impact\u201d on access to abortion in the U.S. (65%, up from 54%). Democratic women of reproductive age are now 13-percentage points more likely to say this election matters in a major way for abortion access. Republican women, on the other hand, don\u2019t see the election as a major tipping point on abortion access with a majority saying the presidential election will have either a \u201cminor impact\u201d or \u201cno impact.\u201d\n\nInflation Remains Women Voters\u2019 Top Issue, Harris Is Seen as Better Candidate to Handle Rising Household Expenses Inflation, including the rising cost of household expenses, continues to be the most important issue for women voters overall, with more than one in three (36%) citing it as the \u201cmost important\u201d issue in their vote for president. This is followed by threats to democracy (24%), and immigration and border security (13%). A slightly larger share of women voters now say abortion is the most important issue to them (13%) than earlier this summer (10%), perhaps a reflection of the increased emphasis placed on reproductive rights by the Harris-Walz ticket. With Harris as the Democratic nominee heading into the election, about one in five (18%) Democratic women voters, rising to one in four (26%) Democratic women voters of reproductive age, say that abortion is the most important issue to them. Even still, inflation remains the most important issue for Democratic and Republican women voters, unchanged from earlier in this campaign season. The rising cost of household expenses remains the top issue among key groups of women voters, most notably Black and Hispanic women. Large majorities of Black women voters (68%) and Hispanic women voters (70%) report worrying \u201ca lot\u201d about affording basic household expenses, and this may be why inflation remains their top voting issue with about half (51%) of Black women and four in ten Hispanic women (41%) saying inflation is their top issue, compared to about one-third of White women (32%). Similar shares of White women prioritize inflation and threats to democracy (27%) this election cycle. Vice President Harris holds the edge among women voters when it comes to handling the rising cost of household expenses, with about half (46%) trusting her over former President Trump (39%). One in six women voters say they trust \u201cneither\u201d candidate to address costs. Harris\u2019 overall advantage on this issue is especially notable because back in June, voters were split evenly on which party they trusted more to deal with this issue, giving neither party the advantage. Harris\u2019s advantage is particularly strong among Black and Hispanic women voters, while White women are split between the two candidates on the issue. Black women voters are seven times as likely to trust Harris on this issue over Trump (70% trust Harris more vs. 10% trust Trump). A slight majority of Hispanic women voters trust Harris (53%) to address costs, and about one in three trust Trump (35%) on the issue. In June, the Democratic Party fared better than the Republican Party among Black and Hispanic women, though to a lesser extent. At the time, four in ten Black (41%) and Hispanic (43%) women voters said they trusted neither political party to best address costs. About half of White women now say they trust Trump to better handle costs (47%), while four in ten trust Harris more (40%). Partisans are split, with majorities trusting their party\u2019s nominee to better address the cost of household expenses. One in seven Republican (14%) and one in eight Democratic (12%) women voters say they do not trust either candidate. Harris also has a strong advantage as the candidate women voters trust to do a better job addressing health care costs, with half saying they trust her and one in three (34%) saying they trust Trump. One in six women voters say they trust \u201cneither\u201d candidate to address health care costs. Among Black women, Harris holds the strongest advantage, with three in four saying they trust the VP more on this issue, while just 5% say they trust Trump more. Hispanic women trust Harris more, at a 2 to 1 ratio (55% for Harris vs. 27% for Trump). White women are split evenly between the two candidates on who they would trust to lower the cost of health care for people like them (43% trust Harris vs. 42% trust Trump). Again, partisans are most likely to trust their party\u2019s candidate on this issue, though nearly one in five Republican women (18%) and one in ten Democratic women say they trust neither candidate.\n\nWomen Voters View the Stakes on Abortion Access as High Women voters are more likely to say that this election will have a \u201cmajor\u201d impact on abortion access than they were June, when President Biden was still the Democratic nominee. Now, two-thirds (65%) of women voters think this election will have a \u201cmajor\u201d impact, up from just over half (54%) in June. Large majorities of Black women (72%), Hispanic women (75%), White women (61%), women of reproductive age (65%), women over age 50 (64%), and Democratic women (82%) now expect this election to have a major impact on abortion access. Democratic women of reproductive age are now 13 percentage points more likely to say this election will majorly impact abortion access (79% now, 66% in June). For Republican women, the perceived stakes of this election on abortion have remained low throughout this campaign cycle with about four in ten Republican women continuing to say they expect a major impact. Three in four women voters say that if elected, they think former President Trump would sign a federal law banning abortion in the U.S. after 15 weeks of pregnancy, should Congress pass such a law. This includes nearly half (47%) who say this is \u201cvery likely.\u201d Majorities across partisans as well as women of reproductive age say they think it is likely that former President Trump will sign a federal law banning abortions after 15 weeks in the U.S., if such a law is passed by Congress. Trump has repeatedly said that he will not sign a federal abortion ban. A federal ban on abortion is unpopular among women voters, with two-thirds overall saying they would oppose a nationwide ban on abortion at 15 weeks of pregnancy. Six in ten Republican women, however, support a nationwide ban. In contrast, most women across party lines, including about nine in ten (94%) Democratic women and three in four Republican women, say VP Harris is likely to sign a law restoring Roe v. Wade, protecting nationwide access to abortion, if she is elected and if such a law is passed by Congress. Seven in ten women voters support a nationwide right to abortion, including majorities of Democratic and independent women voters. Notably, these women voters were less certain of President Biden\u2019s intentions for abortion policy in his second term when he was the Democratic nominee; in June, about seven in ten (72%) women voters said it was likely Biden would sign a law guaranteeing a federal right to abortion until fetal viability, including about one-third (36%) who said this was \u201cvery likely.\u201d At the time, Republican women were more likely to say this was \u201cvery likely\u201d than Democratic women (46% vs. 32%), suggesting that the messaging from the Harris campaign has been clearer to Democratic voters.\n\nVP Harris Holds Advantage on Reproductive Health Issues Nearly twice the share of women voters say they trust Vice President Harris to do a better job than former President Trump deciding policy related to abortion access in the U.S. (58% v. 29%), birth control access (60% vs. 25%) and IVF (55% vs. 29%). Democratic women overwhelmingly say they trust Harris over Trump to decide policy on each of the issues: abortion access (90% vs. 4%), birth control access (92% vs. 4%), and IVF access (88% vs. 5%). In addition, Democratic women are ten percentage points more likely to say they trust Harris to address each of these reproductive health issues than they were to trust Biden in June. About six in ten Republican women say they trust Trump over Harris on the issue of abortion access (65% vs. 17%), birth control access (57% vs. 21%), and access to IVF (64% vs. 14%). However, about one in five or more Republican women say they do not trust either candidate on each of these areas. Among women voters overall, Harris fares better on each of these issues than Biden did in June. At the time, President Biden had the edge over Trump on each of these issues, but a substantial share of women voters said they trust \u201cneither\u201d candidate. Democratic women voters are also becoming more comfortable with Harris speaking on abortion policy. Back in June, about half (49%) of Democratic women voters said they trusted her \u201ca lot\u201d to speak about abortion policy. That share has increased to three in four in the latest Women Voters resurvey. The most notable increase is among Democratic women of reproductive age, who were skeptical of the VP on this issue earlier this summer. The share of Democratic women ages 18 to 49 who say they trust her \u201ca lot\u201d to speak about abortion has nearly doubled in four months, from about one-third (35%) to about two-thirds (66%). Surveyed before the first and only vice-presidential debate of this election cycle, Democratic women are 23-percentage points more likely to say they have \u201ca lot\u201d of trust in their party\u2019s VP candidate, Tim Walz, to speak on issues related to reproductive health than Republican women are of Republican vice-presidential nominee JD Vance (56% vs. 33%).\n\nAbortion Rises as a Key Issue for Young Women Beyond inflation, larger shares of women voters rank abortion as their most important issue heading into this election than in June (13%, up slightly from 10%). This increase is largely driven by young women. Abortion is now the single most important issue to women under age 30, with about four in ten (39%) naming it as their top issue, followed by inflation (28%). This is a dramatic shift from earlier this summer, when half (48%) of women under age 30 cited inflation, and one in five (20%) cited abortion as their top issue. About one in ten women ages 30-54 (12%) or ages 55 and older (7%) say that abortion is their top issue, unchanged from earlier this summer. The stakes for this group are high: about seven in ten (72%) women voters ages 18-29 say this year\u2019s election will have a major impact on access to abortion and one in five say it will have a \u201cminor impact.\u201d Few (8%) say this election won\u2019t impact abortion access. VP Harris fares better among this group on the issue of abortion than Trump (69% say they trust her on the issue, 19% trust the former president), and she fares better than Biden did among this group in June. Earlier this summer, about half (49%) said they trusted Biden to do a better job deciding abortion access policy, and about one in five (18%) trusted Trump. An additional third (33%), however, said they trusted neither candidate at the time.\n\nMood of the Election In early summer 2024, the initial KFF Survey of Women Voters reported that women voters were not largely enthusiastic about the upcoming 2024 presidential election. Resurveyed three months later with a change at the top of the Democratic Party ticket, women voters are not only more satisfied about their options for president, but two-thirds (64%) say they are more motivated to vote in this election compared to previous presidential elections. And while many still feel \u201canxious\u201d and \u201cfrustrated,\" a majority now say they are \u201chopeful\u201d and half say they are \u201centhusiastic\u201d \u2013 marking a massive shift in how women voters see the 2024 election. Two-thirds of women voters now say they are either \u201cvery satisfied\u201d or \u201csomewhat satisfied\u201d with their options for president, up from 40% back in June 2024. Three months ago, the only groups of women voters who said they were satisfied with their options were slight majorities of Republican women (54%) and women voters ages 65 and older (52%). In the latest poll, a majority of women voters across race and ethnicity, party identification, and age say they are satisfied with their choices. This includes a nearly forty percentage point increase in satisfaction among Democratic women voters. Republican women, who were more satisfied than Democrats with their choices back in June, are now less likely to report being satisfied than their Democratic counterparts. About half (52%) of Republican women voters say they are satisfied with their choices for president, similar to their responses from June. In addition, the share of women voters who now say they are \u201cmore motivated\u201d to vote in this presidential election compared to previous elections has increased 19 percentage points, up to 64% in September. This includes a 26-percentage point increase among Democratic women voters, while the share of Republican women voters who say they are more motivated to vote has increased slightly from 53% to 61%. Black women are another group that has seen a considerable increase in the share who say they are now more motivated to vote, especially since so many reported being unsatisfied and not as motivated back in June. Nearly six in ten Black women voters now say they are more motivated to vote compared to the previous election, up from 37% in June. Women voters, across age groups, are all more likely to say they are \u201cmore motivated\u201d now compared to four months ago. For many, the increase in motivation isn\u2019t just because it is closer to Election Day; half of voters (51%) say Vice President Harris becoming the Democratic nominee for president has made them \u201cmore motivated\u201d to vote in the upcoming election. The share of voters who say Harris\u2019 candidacy has made them more motivated increases to nearly six in ten Black women voters and Democratic women voters. The share of women voters who say they are more motivated this election cycle because of Harris\u2019 candidacy also includes 55% of women voters who say abortion is the most important issue in determining their vote choice. When asked explicitly why they are more motivated now that President Biden has decided not to run for reelection and VP Harris is the nominee, Democratic women offer responses saying she is a better candidate or that she has a better chance of beating former President Trump.\n\nDemocratic Women in Their Own Words: \u201cWhy are you now more motivated to vote in the upcoming election now that Vice President Harris is the Democratic nominee?\u201d \u201cShe seems like a competent candidate closer to my age group and will understand issues that affect my generation more than Biden.\u201d \u2013 Hispanic Democratic woman from California, age 37 \u201cI feel the Democrats have a better chance with Harris as the candidate.\u201d \u2013 White Democratic woman from New Hampshire, age 64 \u201cShe is younger, female and a person of color. I was concerned that President Biden could not win reelection. I now think we have a chance.\u201d \u2013 White Democratic woman from Michigan, age 50 \u201cI think she is educated I think she is on top of it smart and intelligent and knows some of the ropes. If we need a change we might as well start with her.\u201d \u2013 Black Democratic woman from Oklahoma, age 70\n\nBut it isn\u2019t just key constituents of the Democratic base who are now more motivated by Harris\u2019 nomination \u2013 nearly half (46%) of Republican women voters also say they are more motivated to vote, mostly to ensure Harris isn\u2019t elected. When asked directly about why they are now more motivated, Republican women say it because they want to make sure Trump wins because they don\u2019t want her to win.\n\nRepublican Women in Their Own Words: \u201cWhy are you now more motivated to vote in the upcoming election now that Vice President Harris is the Democratic nominee?\u201d \u201cShe hasn't done anything to help the American people in four years, why would we want her to be commander in chief!\u201d \u2013 White Republican woman from Ohio, age 75 \u201cSo President Trump will be reelected.\u201d \u2013 Multi-racial Republican woman from Illinois, age 43 \u201cShe is not qualified to be president.\u201d \u2013 White Republican woman from Pennsylvania, age 64 \u201cHoping she doesn\u2019t become the first female president.\u201d \u2013 White Republican woman from Texas, age 38 \u201cBecause Kamala Harris is a threat to our country.\u201d \u2013 White Republican woman from Nebraska, age 77\n\nWomen Voters Feel Both Anxious and Hopeful About Upcoming Election Back in June, the most common feelings women voters had about the upcoming presidential election were frustration and anxiety. Three months later, a majority of women voters still say they feel \u201cfrustrated\u201d (65%) or \u201canxious\u201d (77%) about the upcoming election, but seven in ten (69%) now say they feel \u201chopeful\u201d (up from 53% in June). In addition, nearly half (47%) of women voters say they feel \u201centhusiastic,\u201d up from a third back in June. The share of women voters who say they feel \u201cuninterested\u201d in the election has dropped from 21% to 12%. While anxiety and frustration are high for women across partisanship, Democrats now hold the edge on hope and enthusiasm. Eight in ten Democratic women report being \u201chopeful\u201d (up from 51% in June). Earlier this summer, Republican women were more hopeful than Democratic women, but Democratic women now report feeling more hope. Democratic women also hold the edge on \u201centhusiasm,\u201d whereas Republican women were more enthusiastic than Democratic women back in June.\n\nIn Their Own Words: \u201cWhat emotion best describes how you feel about the upcoming presidential election?\u201d When women voters are asked to offer an emotion that best describes how they are feeling about the upcoming presidential election, \u201chopeful\u201d and \u201cscared\u201d are among the most common feelings \u2013 illustrating an electorate that is experiencing both positive and negative emotions from the upcoming election with two candidates who they view very differently.\n\nAmong Democratic women voters: \u201cVery concerned, but cautiously optimistic.\u201d \u2013 White Democratic woman from Texas, age 60 \u201cNervous, scared, hopeful, angry, and anxious.\u201d \u2013 Hispanic Democratic woman from Texas, age 66 \u201cWe need a good, strong and firm presidential leader for all the people in the United States of America.\u201d \u2013 Black Democratic woman from Florida, age 68 Among Republican women voters: \u201cWorried that fraud will take place again like it did in 2020.\u201d \u2013 White Republican woman from Texas, age 73 \u201cFear of outcome. Uneasiness.\u201d \u2013 White Republican woman from Nebraska, age 77 \u201cReady to MAGA.\u201d \u2013 White Republican woman from New Jersey, age 39\n\nVice President Harris has a strong advantage among women voters on which candidate they trust do a better job \u201clooking out for the interests of women,\u201d with nearly three times as many women voters saying they trust Vice President Harris (60%) than say the same about former President Trump (23%). Nearly all of Democratic women voters (92%) say they trust VP Harris more to look out for the interests of women, while about half of Republican women voters (52%) say they trust former President Trump. One in five (18%) Republican women voters say they trust VP Harris more to do a better job looking out for the interests of women and three in ten say they don\u2019t trust either candidate.\n\nFor Some, the First Female President Is a Motivating Factor When asked why they are now more motivated to vote, seven percent of women voters say it is because they want a woman candidate to win and are motivated by the thought of having the first woman president. Half (47%) of women voters say that being a woman doesn\u2019t hurt or help Vice President Harris as a candidate while one in three (34%) say it helps her as a candidate, and one in five say it hurts her as a candidate. Republican women voters are much more likely to say Harris\u2019 gender doesn\u2019t make a difference (60% v. 35%), while three in ten (28%) Democratic women voters say it hurts her as a candidate compared to one in ten Republican women.\n\nMost women voters say their vote choice hasn\u2019t changed since VP Harris became the Democratic nominee, with the vast majority (98%) of women voters who said back in June that they planned on voting for President Biden now saying they plan on voting for VP Harris. Additionally, 85% of women voters who said they planned on voting for former President Trump back in June continue to say they plan on voting him in the most recent poll. However, a small share (20%) of women voters who either planned on voting for Trump back in June or said they were not going to vote now say they plan on voting for VP Harris (11% of all women voters). When voters are asked why they now plan on voting for VP Harris, about a quarter offer reasons related to seeing Harris as a better candidate and for many her personal characteristics including her age, experience, and ability to care for people resonates most.\n\nIn Their Own Words: \u201cWhat about Harris makes you want to vote for her?\u201d \u201cI guess because I\u2019m a woman and it makes me hopeful that she can do a better job running compared to past presidents. Plus we've never had a female president so I think it\u2019s about time.\u201d \u2013 White independent woman from California, age 36 \u201cShe seems like she will make changes for everyone and will actually do things for the country and do things for our future, especially with me being part of the younger generation to vote.\u201d \u2013 Black Democratic woman from North Carolina, age 26 \u201cShe genuinely cares about people and I feel she will make the USA a better place to live and afford.\u201d \u2013 White independent woman from Pennsylvania, age 56 \u201cHer leadership skills and stances on abortion and economy and experience in politics.\u201d \u2013 Hispanic Democratic woman from California, age 33 \u201cShe's pleasant. She treats everyone fairly. I've never heard her disrespect anyone or treat them unfairly and I think just having morals is very important.\u201d \u2013 Black Democratic woman from Georgia, age 38 \u201cShe wants to raise the minimum wage, she's an advocate for reproductive rights, and stricter gun control.\u201d \u2013 Asian Democratic woman from Texas, age 23 \u201cShe is sharp, energetic, not intimidated by Trump, has values, will stand up for women.\u201d \u2013 White Democratic woman from Washington, age 61 \u201cPlans to improve health, boost the economy and mitigate climate change.\u201d \u2013 Hispanic Democratic woman from Minnesota, age 27 \u201cHer age, her stance on issues, how she conducts herself, her experience. She was my top choice in 2020 and I have been a supporter of hers for a long time. I think her experience in every branch of government, her specific stances, and her personal traits are all assets in this moment in American history.\u201d \u2013 White Democratic woman from New York, age 35\n\nOn the other hand, women voters who plan on voting for former President Trump in the 2024 presidential election offer responses related to his previous experience or his policy decisions when asked about their vote choice. Four in ten women voters who plan on voting for Trump say they think he is a better choice and that he did a good job during his presidency. About a quarter of Trump supporters say his economic policies are why they plan on voting for him.",

        "summary": " NPR/PBS News/Marist poll: Most Americans are concerned about voter fraud in this year\u2019s general election . But research shows voter fraud is infinitesimally rare and almost never occurs on a scale that would affect an election outcome .",
        "text": "How we know voter fraud is very rare in U.S. elections\nHow we know voter fraud is very rare in U.S. elections\n\ntoggle caption Patrick T. Fallon/AFP via Getty Images\n\nMost Americans are concerned about voter fraud in this year\u2019s general election.\n\nThat\u2019s according to a new NPR/PBS News/Marist poll. Much of this concern is driven by Republicans after years of former President Donald Trump and his GOP allies casting doubt on the legitimacy of U.S. elections.\n\nBut voter fraud remains a very rare occurrence across the country.\n\n\u201cResearch has been consistent over time that voter fraud is infinitesimally rare and almost never occurs on a scale that would affect an election outcome,\u201d said Alice Clapman, senior counsel for voting rights at the Brennan Center for Justice, which advocates for expanded voter access.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just research. Clapman said courts have also looked at this issue, as well as government commissions and prosecutorial offices.\n\n\u201cAnd the answer has overwhelmingly been throughout the years that this is extremely rare,\u201d Clapman said. \u201cOftentimes courts, once they look at specific evidence, conclude that the evidence just isn't there.\u201d\n\n\n\nVoter fraud charges happen, but at a very small scale\n\nFollowing Trump\u2019s false claims, leaders in Republican-run states have been ramping up investigations into alleged voter fraud. Despite the increased efforts, the number of potential instances of fraud they are actually finding amounts to a tiny fraction of the number of ballots cast in a state\u2019s election.\n\nIn Ohio, Republican Secretary of State Frank LaRose announced in 2022 his office had found 75 voters who allegedly cast a ballot in the state and another state in 2020. Almost 6 million ballots were cast in Ohio that year.\n\nIn a statement, LaRose\u2019s office said they had referred a total of 630 cases to prosecutors \u201cover the course of multiple elections\u201d \u2014 while also noting \u201cvoter fraud continues to be exceedingly rare\u201d in the state.\n\nAlso after the 2020 election, The Associated Press contacted local election officials in six swing states. In their analysis, they found 475 potential voter fraud cases \u2014 which amounts to an extraordinarily small percentage of the more than 25 million ballots that were cast in those six states.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nOverall, Clapman said, there is a big gap between \u201cthe rhetoric and the actual reality\u201d of how many instances of voter fraud some state officials identify and refer for prosecution.\n\n\u201cWe do oftentimes see dramatic claims by state officials about voter fraud,\u201d she said. \u201cBut what we've seen over the years is that investigations, for example, in Kansas and Colorado, Maine, Florida, across the political spectrum have yielded very, very small instances of actual prosecutions.\u201d\n\n\n\nVoter fraud vs. voting mistakes\n\nAnd even when cases do make it to court, they are sometimes thrown out or face a difficult path through the legal system. This often happens, Clapman said, in cases that involve ineligible voters who voted \u201caccidentally in good faith, believing that they were eligible.\u201d\n\nClapman said a lot of these cases involve people who at one point lost their voting rights due to a felony conviction. Some examples are from Florida, where 20 formerly incarcerated people were arrested for alleged illegal voting, even though they were given voter registration cards; as well as a prominent case in Texas involving a woman named Crystal Mason who said she thought she was eligible to vote in 2016.\n\nClapman said conservative-leaning groups often lump all cases where the voter thought they were eligible along with cases where someone intended to commit fraud.\n\n\u201cThese numbers don't distinguish between, you know, an allegation that may be incorrect or a situation where someone has voted in good faith incorrectly,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nStates have systems to prevent someone from voting illegally\n\nLastly, states have a series of mechanisms to help weed out people who are ineligible to vote before they could cast a ballot.\n\nStates, by law, are required to routinely remove ineligible or deceased voters from their rolls. And there are tools like the Electronic Registration Information Center, also known as ERIC, that help states share voter data.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nDepending on the type of voting \u2014 in-person vs. mail-in \u2014 there are also a host of protections that would keep someone from casting a ballot that isn\u2019t theirs, or from voting altogether if they are ineligible. That includes things like signature matching, drop box surveillance, as well as poll worker training.\n\n\u201cStates have very effective protections in place to prevent and detect voter fraud,\u201d Clapman said. \u201cAnd then it is always important to be reminded that the penalty for voter fraud is enormous.\u201d",

        "text": "Why are American Presidential Election Campaign Polls so Variable when Votes are so Predictable?\nAbstract:\n\nAs most political scientists know, the outcome of the U.S. Presidential election can be predicted within a few percentage points (in the popular vote), based on information available months before the election. Thus, the general election campaign for president seems irrelevant to the outcome (except in very close elections), despite all the media coverage of campaign strategy. However, it is also well known that the pre-election opinion polls can vary wildly over the campaign, and this variation is generally attributed to events in the campaign. How can campaign events affect people\u2019s opinions on whom they plan to vote for, and yet not affect the outcome of the election? For that matter, why do voters consistently increase their support for a candidate during his nominating convention, even though the conventions are almost entirely predictable events whose effects can be rationally forecast? In this exploratory study, we consider several intuitively appealing, but ultimately wrong, resolutions to this puzzle, and discuss our current understanding of what causes opinion polls to fluctuate and yet reach a predictable outcome. Our evidence is based on graphical presentation and analysis of over 67,000 individual-level responses from forty-nine commercial polls during the 1988 campaign and many other aggregate poll results from the 1952\u20131992 campaigns. We show that responses to pollsters during the campaign are not generally informed or even, in a sense we describe, \"rational.\" In contrast, voters decide which candidate to eventually support based on their enlightened preferences, as formed by the information they have learned during the campaign, as well as basic political cues such as ideology and party identification. We cannot prove this conclusion, but we do show that it is consistent with the aggregate forecasts and individual-level opinion poll responses. Based on the enlightened preferences hypothesis, we conclude that the news media have an important effect on the outcome of Presidential elections\u2013-not due to misleading advertisements, sound bites, or spin doctors, but rather by conveying candidates\u2019 positions on important issues.\n\n\n\nWinner of the Pi Sigma Alpha Award for the best paper at the previous year\u2019s meetings of the Midwest Political Science Association.\n\nReplication data at the Harvard Dataverse: https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/I7GIKD.",

        "text": "US To Hold Referendum On Abortion On Same Ballot As Presidential Vote\nAbortion rights are arguably the single-most important issue in the US ahead of the presidential election on November 5. It affects 50 per cent of the US population and is a matter of an individual's fundamental liberty, which is protected by the Fourteenth Amendment of the US Constitution.\n\nDuring his term as President, Donald Trump reshaped the Supreme Court, which in 2022 left the states to decide their own abortion policies by overturning Roe vs Wade, the federal guarantee of abortion access - and thus dismantling five decades of precedent protecting abortion rights across the US.\n\nNow, at least ten states in the US are holding referendums on the issue of abortion, and the questions on it will appear on the same ballots used to cast the vote to select the next US President.\n\nThis is the first US presidential election to be held after access to abortion was banned or restricted across much of the US following a landmark Supreme Court ruling.\n\nThe outcome could have profound implications, with the potential for restrictions affecting tens of millions of women to be overturned. Democrats also hope that the issue will mobilise a broader swath of the electorate in their favor.\n\nIn recent times, women in the US are being forced to cross state lines to terminate their life-threatening pregnancies. \"This is a health care crisis, and Donald Trump is the architect,\" Kamala Harris has said.\n\nTHE REFERENDUMS\n\nAccording to the Fourteenth Amendment of the US Constitution, \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\"\n\nWith the referendums in November, each constitutional amendment will enshrine state-level reproductive rights, which were undermined by the US Supreme Court's 2022 ruling which led to restrictions on abortion access.\n\nAmong the states that have been affected by the US Supreme Court ruling which has made abortions restrictive, Arizona, Florida, Missouri, Nebraska, and South Dakota are holding referendums.\n\nAs of now, the other states that are holding the vote on abortion rights are Colorado, Maryland, Montana, Nevada, and New York.\n\nWHAT IT WILL MEAN FOR THESE STATES",

        "text": "Justice Department Sues Virginia for Violating Federal Law\u2019s Prohibition on Systematic Efforts to Remove Voters Within 90 Days of an Election\nThe Justice Department announced today that it has filed a lawsuit against the State of Virginia, Virginia State Board of Elections and Virginia Commissioner of Elections to challenge a systematic state program aimed at removing voters from its election rolls too close to the Nov. 5 general election in violation of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA).\n\nSection 8(c)(2) of the NVRA, also known as the Quiet Period Provision, requires states to complete systematic programs aimed at removing the names of ineligible voters from voter registration lists no later than 90 days before federal elections. The Quiet Period Provision applies to certain systematic programs carried out by states that are aimed at striking names from voter registration lists based on a perceived failure to meet initial eligibility requirements \u2014 including citizenship \u2014 at the time of registration.\n\n\u201cAs the National Voter Registration Act mandates, officials across the country should take heed of the law\u2019s crystal clear and unequivocal restrictions on systematic list maintenance efforts that fall within 90 days of an election,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division. \u201cBy cancelling voter registrations within 90 days of Election Day, Virginia places qualified voters in jeopardy of being removed from the rolls and creates the risk of confusion for the electorate. Congress adopted the National Voter Registration Act\u2019s quiet period restriction to prevent error-prone, eleventh hour efforts that all too often disenfranchise qualified voters. The right to vote is the cornerstone of our democracy and the Justice Department will continue to ensure that the rights of qualified voters are protected.\u201d\n\nThe Quiet Period is an important protection for voters, because systematic removal programs may be error-ridden, cause voter confusion and remove eligible voters days or weeks before Election Day who may be unable to correct the State\u2019s errors in time to vote or may be dissuaded from voting at all. States may remove names from official lists of voters in various ways and for various reasons, but they may not carry-on this kind of systematic removal program so close to a federal election.\n\nOn Aug. 7, the governor of Virginia signed an executive order requiring among other things that the commissioner of the Department of Elections certify that the Department of Elections was conducting \u201cDaily Updates to the Voter List.\u201d These updates included \u201ccompar[ing] the list of individuals who have been identified as non-citizens\u201d by the State Department of Motor Vehicles \u201cto the list of existing registered voters.\u201d Local registrars were then required to \u201cnotify any matches of their pending cancellation unless they affirm their citizenship within 14 days.\u201d The letter directs recipients who are in fact U.S. citizens and eligible to vote to complete and return an Affirmation of Citizenship form. The notice informs voters that, if they do not respond to the notice within 14 days, they will be removed from the list of registered voters. This process has led to U.S. citizens having their voter registrations cancelled.\n\nThe process laid out in the executive order formalized an ongoing list maintenance procedure that has been carried out into the quiet period, including at least as recently as late September. This systematic voter removal program, which the State is conducting within 90 days of the upcoming federal election, violates the Quiet Period Provision.\n\nThe Justice Department seeks injunctive relief that would restore the ability of impacted eligible voters to vote unimpeded on Election Day and would prohibit future quiet period violations. The department also seeks remedial mailings to educate eligible voters concerning the restoration of their rights and adequate training of local officials and poll workers to address confusion and distrust among eligible voters accused of being noncitizens.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division, U.S. Attorney Jessica Aber for the Eastern District of Virginia and U.S. Attorney Christopher R. Kavanaugh for the Western District of Virginia made the announcement.\n\nIndividuals who are eligible voters and believe that they may have been removed from the voter rolls as a result of Virginia\u2019s systematic removal process should contact the Civil Rights Division\u2019s Voting Section through the internet reporting portal at civilrights.justice.gov or by telephone at 1-800-253-3931. More information about voting and elections, including guidance documents and other resources, is available at www.justice.gov/voting. More information about the NVRA and other federal voting laws is available at www.justice.gov/crt/voting-section. The department recently announced a new guidance document addressing limits on when and how jurisdictions may remove voters from their voter lists. Complaints about discriminatory voting practices may be reported to the Civil Rights Division\u2019s Voting Section through the internet reporting portal at civilrights.justice.gov or by telephone at 1-800-253-3931.",

        "text": "6 facts about false noncitizen voting claims and the election\n6 facts about false noncitizen voting claims and the election\n\ntoggle caption Kamil Krzaczynski/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThis presidential campaign, former President Donald Trump and other Republicans have been repeating the false narrative that Democrats are purposefully letting migrants into the country so they will vote.\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence for the claim, which echoes a racist conspiracy theory known as the \"great replacement.\"\n\nIn fact, allegations about voter fraud and noncitizens have been floating around American politics for more than a century.\n\nThe GOP has made it a legislative priority to update federal law to require documentary proof of citizenship to register to vote in federal races. Opponents point out that millions of eligible voters \u2014 about 1 in 10 adult U.S. citizens, according to one recent survey \u2014 don\u2019t have ready access to documents that prove their citizenship, such as a birth certificate or passport, and would face hurdles to vote.\n\nHere are six things to know about the false narratives circulating.\n\n\n\nThere are severe penalties for noncitizens who illegally try to vote\n\nIt\u2019s illegal for people who are not U.S. citizens to vote in federal or state elections. And the federal voter registration form asks registrants to affirm, under penalty of perjury, that they are eligible citizens. The form warns those who make false statements could be fined, imprisoned or deported. Noncitizens who register to vote can also lose the ability to ever become U.S. citizens.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nVoting rights advocates say these penalties have worked as effective deterrents. \"Anybody who is on a green card or attempting to get citizenship in America, they are not trying to be arrested or to be tossed out of the country,\" said Sylvia Albert, the director of voting and elections for Common Cause.\n\nThe rare cases that do happen leave a paper trail.\n\nSix green card holders were recently indicted in Ohio for allegedly voting in past elections. A University of Michigan student from China who is not a U.S. citizen is accused of voting last month and has been criminally charged.\n\nElection officials regularly verify voter registration information and remove ineligible voters from voter rolls. Some states verify citizenship by cross-checking voter information with other databases, such as state motor vehicle data or the federal SAVE database. Election officials must be careful not to mistakenly remove eligible voters from voter rolls, since some databases may be outdated and may not show if an immigrant has become a naturalized citizen. Such errors resulted in large numbers of eligible citizens wrongly flagged for removal in Texas in 2019 and has repeated this year as Republican officials in a number of states have publicized new initiatives to remove possible noncitizens that have ensnared eligible U.S. citizens.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAlabama election officials inactivated the registrations of 3,251 individuals on the grounds that they were potential noncitizens but then acknowledged last month at least 2,074 were actually eligible voters, according to court filings. A federal judge halted the program because a federal law bans systematic purges in the 90 days before an election. The judge said in an Oct. 16 hearing that the state \"has identified a handful, at least four, perhaps as many as ten, perhaps more, noncitizens who were somehow on Alabama's voter rolls.\"\n\nLast week, the Supreme Court allowed Virginia to continue removing voters from its rolls in an effort to remove suspected noncitizens, though eligible U.S. citizens were mistakenly removed by the program.\n\n\n\nAvailable data shows noncitizen voting is incredibly rare\n\nAfter the 2016 election, the Brennan Center for Justice, which advocates for voting rights, surveyed local election officials in 42 jurisdictions with high immigrant populations and found just 30 cases of suspected noncitizens voting out of 23.5 million votes cast, or 0.0001%.\n\nThe Brennan Center survey did not include North Carolina, where a state audit after the 2016 election found 41 cases of green card holders who voted out of nearly 4.8 million votes in the state. The same report said many of the noncitizen voters had been misinformed that they could vote.\n\nAn audit in Georgia last month showed 20 suspected noncitizens on the rolls out of 8.2 million registered voters (0.00024% of the state's list). Nine had a history of voting and all 20 were referred to law enforcement.\n\ntoggle caption Brandon Bell/Getty Images/Getty Images North America\n\nAfter a federal trial last year over Arizona\u2019s documentary proof of citizenship laws, the federal judge concluded, \"though it may occur, non-citizens voting in Arizona is quite rare, and non-citizen voter fraud in Arizona is rarer still.\"\n\nSometimes noncitizens wind up on voter rolls due to the errors of government officials. A mistake in Oregon\u2019s automatic voter registration system through the state\u2019s driver and motor vehicle services caused 1,561 people to be mistakenly added to the state voter rolls who had not provided proof of U.S. citizenship. State authorities have so far identified 10 people who had voted, and confirmed that at least six were U.S. citizens when they cast ballots, according to a spokesperson for the Oregon Department of Transportation.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nWhile the conservative Heritage Foundation has actively promoted claims about the risk of noncitizens voting this campaign season, its own data suggests how rare these cases are. The Washington Post reviewed a Heritage database of voter fraud cases and found 85 cases relating to allegations of noncitizens voting between 2002 and 2023.\n\nThe American Immigration Council, which advocates for immigrant rights, also analyzed the Heritage data and found most noncitizen voting cases involve legal immigrants and many had been incorrectly told they could vote. That analysis found only 10 cases involving undocumented immigrants since the 1980s. Heritage has said the database is just a sampling of fraud cases and is not comprehensive.\n\n\n\nFlawed studies have fueled false claims\n\nA widely contested 2014 paper by researchers at Old Dominion University has fueled exaggerated claims about noncitizen voting rates. The study, which was led by political scientist Jesse Richman, drew its conclusions from an online survey known as the Cooperative Election Survey. A small number of respondents had indicated they were noncitizens and that they had voted. Richman\u2019s paper used that data to estimate that 6.4% of noncitizens voted in 2008.\n\nBut that estimate immediately came under fire. The developers of the CES survey wrote a rebuttal, detailing how Richman\u2019s research was methodologically unsound because the small subset of people who reported being noncitizen voters could easily have been citizens who had simply selected the wrong box.\n\nNevertheless, Trump seized on and distorted Richman\u2019s estimates to fuel false claims in 2016 that millions of noncitizens had illegally voted. In the aftermath, some 200 fellow political scientists wrote an open letter rejecting the 2014 paper. That didn\u2019t stop the website Just Facts from publishing a report in May based on the paper\u2019s discredited estimates. That report made the disputed claim that 10% to 27% of noncitizens are illegally registered to vote, which went viral on X and was cited in congressional testimony.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nRichman has since revised down his estimate for national noncitizen voter registration rates to just under 1%, and participation to half a percent.\n\ntoggle caption -/AFP via Getty Images/AFP\n\nA small number of localities allow noncitizens to vote in municipal races only\n\nWashington, D.C., and a small number of municipalities in California, Maryland and Vermont do allow noncitizens to vote in some local elections, such as city council or school board races. But so far, turnout has been low from this population. Noncitizens are still barred from voting in federal and state elections in all of these places, and there are systems in place to ensure they do not receive ballots for those other races.\n\n\n\nMost people who arrived at the border in recent years have no path to citizenship\n\nOne false narrative this campaign season suggests that the people who arrived at the U.S.-Mexico border during the Biden administration can quickly become citizens and vote legally. But the vast majority of migrants have no path to citizenship. For the minority who will ultimately be granted asylum, it often takes more than a decade from the time they enter the country to go through all the steps to win their cases and ultimately naturalize. Furthermore, changes to asylum protocols during the Biden administration have made it harder to pursue asylum in this country and eventually become a citizen.\n\n\n\nMisleading claims about noncitizens voting can undermine confidence in the 2024 election\n\nBy focusing on baseless allegations about noncitizens voting in the upcoming election, Trump and his allies appear to be laying the groundwork for potentially contesting the election.\n\n\"You can absolutely bet if Trump loses, he will claim there was widespread noncitizen voting without any evidence whatsoever,\" David Becker, the executive director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research, told NPR in September. \"And that is going to incite anger and potentially violence.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThis article was updated on Nov. 5.",

        "text": "Will escalating violence in the Middle East affect the US elections?\nWith the United States presidential election less than four weeks away, analysts caution that Israel\u2019s expanding military campaigns across the Middle East could bruise the chances of the Democratic candidate, Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nForeign policy is rarely a top priority for US voters. But Israel\u2019s yearlong war in Gaza, as well as its intense bombing campaign in Lebanon, have spurred questions about the US\u2019s role in the conflict.\n\nThe administration of President Joe Biden has been unwavering in its support of Israel, splintering the Democratic base, with some voters \u2014 particularly Arab Americans \u2014 turning against the party.\n\nWith Harris in a tight race against former Republican President Donald Trump, anger towards the Biden administration could mean that Arab voters in key states like Michigan stay home in November.\n\n\u201cThis is a constituency that, by the second term of the Obama administration, identified as Democrat by a two-to-one margin,\u201d Jim Zogby, the co-founder of the Arab American Institute, told Al Jazeera. \u201cNow party identification is virtually tied at 38 percent each.\u201d\n\nMuch of that decrease, he said, has to do with the Biden administration\u2019s support for the war in Gaza, which has erased entire neighbourhoods and killed more than 42,000 people, many of them women and children.\n\nThat campaign has been enabled by about $20bn in US weapons assistance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s less that this group of voters is getting more conservative, and more that they want to punish this administration for what they\u2019ve allowed to happen,\u201d said Zogby.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a sense that Palestinian and Lebanese lives don\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nEroding support\n\nA September poll by the Arab American Institute found that Harris and Trump were virtually tied among Arab voters, receiving 41 percent and 42 percent support, respectively.\n\nThat figure is actually a marked improvement for the Democrats. When Biden was running for re-election, his support among Arab voters cratered after the beginning of the war in Gaza, dropping to just 17 percent in October 2023.\n\nBiden previously won 59 percent of the Arab vote in the 2020 presidential race.\n\nWhen Biden dropped out of the 2024 race, following a debate performance that underscored concerns about the 81-year-old\u2019s age, some voters hoped his replacement, Harris, would bring a fresh approach.\n\nBut Harris has thus far refused to break with Biden or call for an end to weapons transfers, even as a series of escalatory strikes by Israel have brought the Middle East to the brink of a wider regional war.\n\nIn a TV interview this week, when asked whether she would have diverged from Biden on any issues, Harris replied: \u201cThere is not a thing that comes to mind.\u201d\n\nThe Harris campaign also fielded criticism during August\u2019s Democratic National Convention, after party officials refused to allow a Palestinian American speaker on stage to give voice to the suffering in Gaza.\n\n\u201cPeople are looking for the slightest gesture of humanity, and the campaign just won\u2019t give it to them,\u201d said Zogby. \u201cThey\u2019re making a mistake that will cost them votes.\u201d\n\nSwing states\n\nWhile US policy towards Gaza may not be a top priority for most voters, more than 80 percent of Arab Americans say that it will play an important role in determining their vote.\n\nMany of those voters are concentrated in a small number of swing states that play an outsized role in deciding the country\u2019s presidential elections.\n\nThe Midwestern battleground state of Michigan, for instance, has the second-largest Arab population in the country. It also has the largest percentage of Arab Americans of any state: Nearly 392,733 people identify as Arab in a state of 10 million.\n\nPolling averages show Harris with a lead of only around 1.8 percent there, well within the margin of error.\n\nAnd her razor-thin lead in the state could be eroded by third-party candidates like Jill Stein, who has actively courted the Arab and Muslim American vote in the area.\n\n\u201cThe situation in Gaza has complicated Democratic chances in Michigan,\u201d said Michael Traugott, a research professor at the Center for Political Studies at the University of Michigan.\n\n\u201cSince we expect things to be close, it will hurt Harris if a large portion of the state\u2019s Arab community stays home on election day,\u201d he added.\n\nBut Michigan\u2019s Arab American population is no monolith, and there have been bitter divisions within the community over how best to use its electoral leverage.\n\nSome believe that a Harris loss in Michigan would send a warning to future candidates about underestimating the influence of Arab voters.\n\nOthers view a second term for Trump, a pro-Israel hawk, as an unacceptable risk: the Republican has previously said that Israel should \u201cfinish the job\u201d in Gaza and vowed to deport foreign nationals involved in pro-Palestine student protests.\n\nOne group attempting to walk a tightrope between those perspectives is the Uncommitted National Movement, an organisation born of a protest movement against Biden.\n\nDuring primaries, the movement called on Democrats to vote \u201cuncommitted\u201d, rather than throwing their support behind the Democratic president.\n\nNow, as the general election approaches on November 5, the movement says it cannot support Harris \u2014 but it also opposes a second Trump presidency.\n\n\u201cAs a Palestinian American, the current administration\u2019s handling of this genocide has been beyond enraging and demoralising,\u201d a spokesperson said in a video released this week.\n\n\u201cBut the reality is that it can get worse. Nobody wants a Trump presidency more than [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu, because that is his ticket to wiping Palestine off the map.\u201d\n\nExpanding fighting\n\nThe final weeks of the presidential race have coincided with the looming threat of further escalation in the Middle East, adding an element of uncertainty to the final weeks of the US race.\n\nIn early October, for instance, Iran launched a ballistic missile attack against Israel, in response to the assassinations of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran and Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut, among others.\n\nOn that same day, Israel launched a ground operation in southern Lebanon, in addition to its deadly aerial bombing campaign in the region. Israel is expected to take further action against Iran as well.\n\nAnalysts worry that a massive Israeli retaliation could set off a destructive war between Israel and Iran, an anxiety shared by many in the US.\n\nA September poll by the Pew Research Center found that 44 percent of Americans are extremely or very concerned about the fighting spreading to other countries in the Middle East. Forty percent felt the same about the possibility of US forces becoming more directly involved.\n\nRespondents who identified with the Democratic Party were also more likely to believe that Israel\u2019s war in Gaza has gone too far and that the US should do more to bring it to an end.\n\nLaura Silver, associate director of global research at Pew, told Al Jazeera that those results reflect diverging views between Democrats and Republicans over foreign policy.\n\n\u201cRepublican-affiliated Americans are much more likely to want the US to provide weapons to Israel, and they\u2019re somewhat less likely to want the US to play a diplomatic role,\u201d Silver said.\n\nShe pointed out that younger and older people also had different approaches to the war in Gaza \u2014 and the Israel-Palestine conflict more generally.\n\nA February poll found that 36 percent of people between the ages of 18 and 29 said the Biden administration favoured Israel too much in the current war, compared with just 16 percent of people aged 50 to 64.\n\nBut Zogby said that Democrats have yet to recognise the shifts taking place among important constituencies, such as young people and communities of colour, on the question of Palestine.\n\n\u201cThe pro-Palestine movement has become part of a larger focus on social justice,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Democratic Party hasn\u2019t changed on this, but the people who vote for them have. They aren\u2019t listening, and they\u2019ll pay a price for that.\u201d",

        "summary": " There is no evidence that Tim Walz sexually assaulted and had an inappropriate relationship with a student in 1995 or any other year . The originator of the claim wrote a series of posts on X from Oct. 11-14, 2024, relaying accusations claimed to have been made to him in August 2024 by a former student at Alliance High School .",
        "text": "2024 Elections Misinformation Tracker\nTHE FACTS:\n\nThere is no evidence that vice-presidential candidate Tim Walz sexually assaulted and had an inappropriate relationship with a student in 1995 or any other year. The originator of the claim \u2014 an anonymous, now-deleted X account that regularly advanced false narratives with the username @DocNetyoutube \u2014 used altered or fabricated images and videos to support the allegations and failed to provide credible evidence of the supposed accuser\u2019s existence.\n\n@DocNetyoutube wrote a series of posts on X from Oct. 11-14, 2024, relaying accusations claimed to have been made to him in August 2024 by a former student at Alliance High School in Nebraska, where Walz taught social studies and coached football from 1992 to 1996. As purported evidence of his claims, @DocNetyoutube shared screenshots and screen recordings purporting to show emails that he exchanged with the supposed victim, typed statements from the alleged victim, and messages that @DocNetyoutubeclaimed to have sent to the Harris-Walz campaign and to Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 office in August 2024.\n\nHowever, there are clear signs that several of the images and videos shared by @DocNetyoutube were altered or fabricated, suggesting that the allegations he shared \u2014 and the supposed accuser\u2019s existence \u2014 were fabricated, too. For example, a screenshot purporting to show an email from the supposed victim displayed a text cursor, indicating that the person who took the screenshot is likely the same person who typed the message shown, rather than having received it in an email.\n\nAlso, in an image purporting to show an email supposedly sent by the alleged victim that stated that Walz \u201cdid unspeakable things to me,\u201d the comma that should automatically appear between the day and month of the \u201csent\u201d date was missing. Commas appear in that spot in all the other screenshots that @DocNetyoutube posted, indicating that he likely created them himself and left out a comma. And one screen recording purports to show @DocNetyoutube using a contact form on the Harris-Walz campaign\u2019s website to send a message about the allegations on Aug. 28, 2024. However, the screenshot could not have been taken on that date, because the campaign website had a different design at that time, archived versions of the site show.\n\nMoreover, it appears that @DocNetyoutube may have gotten the idea about Walz taking the alleged victim to an Indigo Girls concert from an August 2024 New York Times article about Walz\u2019s history of supporting LGBTQ students. The article reported that Walz and his wife, Gwen Walz, brought a gay Alliance High School student to an Indigo Girls concert in the 1990s. The Times did not name the student.\n\nHowever, the student mentioned in the Times article identified himself in September 2024. Todd Almond, an actor and playwright who appeared in the 2020-2022 Broadway production of \u201cGirl from the North Country,\u201d told the blog The Queer Love Project that he was the student the Times mentioned as having attended the Indigo Girls concert with the Walzes. Almond has campaigned for the Harris-Walz ticket with Gwen Walz, according to an Oct. 17, 2024 post on his Instagram, in which he called the Walzes \u201cmy decades long friends.\u201d\n\nIn a post replying to an X user who pointed to Almond as the former student who attended the Indigo Girls concert with Walz, @DocNetyoutube first falsely claimed that Almond did not attend Alliance High School. After users shared links to an archived version of the 1995 Alliance yearbook, in which Almond appeared, @DocNetyoutube added details to the supposed victim\u2019s story. After it became clear that it was Almond who attended the show with the couple and that he was not the accuser, @DocNetyoutube shared a new \u201cstatement\u201d from the supposed victim. That statement said that \u201cGwen Walz was with another student\u201d at the Indigo Girls concert, while Tim Walz was alone with the supposed victim.\n\nThere is no independent report of multiple students attending an Indigo Girls concert with the Walzes. The Times report mentioned just one concert and one student, who turned out to be Almond.",

        "text": "US Justice Department sues Virginia for purging voters before election\nThe move comes as Republicans increasingly emphasise the chance of noncitizen voting, despite little evidence of any significant risk posed.\n\nThe United States Justice Department has sued Virginia for removing voters from registration rolls too close to the presidential election on November 5.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed on Friday, comes in response to an executive order issued in August by Virginia\u2019s Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin.\n\nIt initiated the removal of individuals from voter registration rolls if officials are \u201cunable to verify that they are citizens\u201d through the state\u2019s Department of Motor Vehicles.\n\nBut the Justice Department says the executive order was issued with too little time before election day, violating a 90-day \u201cquiet period\u201d outlined in The National Voter Registration Act.\n\nThat period requires official systematic removals at least three months ahead of a federal vote.\n\n\u201cCongress adopted the National Voter Registration Act\u2019s quiet period restriction to prevent error-prone, eleventh-hour efforts that all too often disenfranchise qualified voters,\u201d Assistant US Attorney General Kristen Clarke said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe right to vote is the cornerstone of our democracy and the Justice Department will continue to ensure that the rights of qualified voters are protected.\u201d\n\nYoungkin had issued his order on August 7, which marked 90 days until the election. In a statement on Friday, the governor argued the executive order fell within the law.\n\n\u201cVirginians \u2013 and Americans \u2013 will see this for exactly what it is: a desperate attempt to attack the legitimacy of the elections in the Commonwealth, the very crucible of American Democracy,\u201d Youngkin said.\n\nHe pledged state authorities \u201cwill defend these common-sense steps, that we are legally required to take, with every resource available to us\u201d.\n\n\u201cVirginia\u2019s election will be secure and fair, and I will not stand idly by as this politically motivated action tries to interfere in our elections, period,\u201d Youngkin said.\n\nRepublicans and allies of former President Donald Trump \u2013 the current Republican candidate for the presidency \u2013 have increasingly pushed unfounded claims of possible election malfeasance ahead of this year\u2019s vote.\n\nThose claims echo falsehoods spread about the 2020 election, which Trump has continued to falsely say was \u201cstolen\u201d through fraud.\n\nSome Republican officials have also advanced baseless claims that noncitizens are voting in large enough numbers to affect the outcome. In the US, only citizens can vote.\n\nMost voter administration is determined by state officials and legislatures, with only broad parameters from the federal government. Nearly all US states require some form of voter registration to cast a ballot, although many allow the registration to be done on election day.\n\nAhead of the 2024 elections, several states \u2013 including Texas, Tennessee, Ohio and Alabama \u2013 have passed measures requiring higher burdens of proof to show a voter\u2019s citizenship. Democracy monitors said those efforts may disenfranchise US citizens who are otherwise eligible to vote.\n\nThe Brennan Center for Justice \u2013 a non-partisan policy organisation \u2013 found that noncitizen voting in the US is exceedingly rare. There is no evidence it had any bearing on recent elections.\n\nIn 2017, the centre released a study looking at 23.5 million votes cast in the 2016 general election.\n\nOnly 30 votes were flagged for suspected noncitizen voting. Data was not available on how many of those votes proved to have been cast by noncitizens.",

Mario Tama/Getty Images\n\nFormer President Donald Trump launched into a deeply personal attack of Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff during his campaign rally in Coachella, California, on Saturday, calling the Democratic Senate nominee names and mocking his physical appearance.\n\nThe comments followed an extended riff in which Trump defended his praise of Chinese President Xi Jinping, whom he called a \u201cbrilliant\u201d leader who rules \u201cwith an iron fist.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe worst people are the enemies from within, the sleazebags like the guy that you\u2019re going to elect to the Senate, shifty Adam Schiff,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThe former president suggested without evidence that Schiff would win because of voter fraud and called the California Democrat a \u201clow life,\u201d a \u201csick puppy\u201d and \u201cone of the least attractive human beings I think I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\nSchiff brushed off the comments in a social media post.\n\n\u201cYet another nonsensical rant about me filled with tired insults, lies about voting booths, and more, this time in my home state of California,\u201d he wrote in a post on X. \u201cSeriously, Donald. Why are you so obsessed with me?\u201d\n\nSome background: The animosity between the former president and the California Democrat dates to the early days of Trump\u2019s presidency. Schiff has been one of the former president\u2019s most vocal critics in Congress and served as the House impeachment manager during Trump\u2019s first trial.\n\nSchiff, who represents a House district in Los Angeles County, is running to fill the remainder of the late Sen. Dianne Feinstein\u2019s term in the Senate and a full six-year term in the upper chamber. He is running against former baseball star Steve Garvey, a Republican.\n\nSchiff is heavily favored to win based on polling, fundraising and the state\u2019s voting history. Republicans have not won statewide in California since 2006.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s blue voting habits didn\u2019t stop Trump from campaigning in the state, however. The former president has taken a detour from campaigning in battleground states to hold events in Democratic strongholds such as Colorado, where he held a rally Friday, and California\u2019s Coachella Valley. Trump will also campaign in New York later this month.",

        "text": "Explained: The seven battleground states that could decide the US election\nCampaigns for the United States presidential election are well underway, with tens of millions of voters due to turn out on Tuesday 5 November.\n\n\n\n\n\nSeven swing states have been identified in the race between Democratic vice president Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump : Nevada, Arizona, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, North Carolina and Georgia.\n\n\n\n\n\nSwing states are those that have similar levels of support for both candidates and could lean either way come election day.\n\n\n\n\n\nResults in these states will likely decide the election and many will have razor-thin margins that could come down to tens of thousands of voters.\n\n\n\nWhy are these states so important?\n\nSwing states are important because US presidential elections are decided by a voting system known as the Electoral College and not the popular vote.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Electoral College is a weighted system where 538 electors decide the winner, with a majority of 270 electoral votes required to win the presidency.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Personal attacks and vitriolic remarks: how US politics differs from Australian SBS News 01/10/2024 08:44 Play\n\nStates each have the same number of electoral votes as they have representatives and senators \u2014 electoral votes do not correspond to population size in most states.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, in Wyoming, one electoral vote accounts for 195,000 people, but in Texas, Florida and California, one electoral vote accounts for over 700,000 people.\n\n\n\n\n\nAssociate Professor David Smith from the United States Studies Centre said the Electoral College was a controversial voting system, and increasing polarisation in the US meant that discrepancies between the popular vote and the Electoral College were more likely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Now we have some states that are overwhelmingly one side or the other that means you are never going to get these sweeping electoral college victories that you used to have, which reflected the popular vote,\" he told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You can have these situations where the loser on the popular vote can actually win the electoral college.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe electoral votes in Nevada (six votes), Arizona (11 votes), Wisconsin (10 votes), Pennsylvania (19 votes), Michigan (15 votes), North Carolina (16 votes) and Georgia (16 votes) are essential for victory in 2024.\n\n\n\nA key factor that unites the swing states in this electoral cycle is that they all have large urban and rural areas, which creates a strong political divide. Source: Getty / Scott Olson\n\nAre swing states always the same?\n\nSwing states have changed throughout the history of US presidential elections.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe states considered swing states in this election cycle have been recognised as such for several election cycles but other states used to be major points of focus.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, Missouri was once considered a key swing state that Democratic candidates needed to win to secure the presidency, however, in 2008 Barack Obama became the first Democrat to be elected without the state.\n\n\n\nSource: SBS News In 2020, President Joe Biden won the presidency without winning Florida, a feat that had not been accomplished for several decades.\n\n\n\n\n\nSmith said most states have historically changed allegiance between the Democratic and Republican parties quite routinely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think a good historical thing that explains this is in 1984, Ronald Reagan won 49 of the 50 states \u2014 the one that he missed was Minnesota. In 1964, Lyndon Johnson won 44 out of the 50 states,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That means that there aren't any states that have had a consistent record of voting for the same party that goes back more than a few decades because you've got these electoral wipe-outs on both sides.\"\n\n\n\nThe seven swing states are overwhelming the focus of campaign events and advertising for Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. Source: Getty / Jeff Swensen\n\nWhat's unique about swing states?\n\nSmith said that a key factor that unites the swing states in this electoral cycle is that they all have large urban and rural areas, which creates a strong political divide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In all these states, you've got one or two big cities. Milwaukee and Madison in Wisconsin, Detroit in Michigan, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania, Atlanta in Georgia, Phoenix in Arizona, and Las Vegas in Nevada. And then you've got a lot of rural areas, which are overwhelmingly Republican,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nSmith said states where Democrats win consistently have a significantly larger urban population, including California, New York and Illinois. Whereas states with large rural populations, such as Wyoming, Alabama and Missouri, have become reliably Republican.\n\n\n\nHow have Kamala Harris and Donald Trump campaigned in these states?\n\nSwing states are overwhelming the focus of presidential campaigns, with nearly all campaign events held in these states.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to frequently hosting rallies, Harris and Trump are both spending a large amount of money on advertising in swing states.\n\n\n\n\n\nPennsylvania has been a particular point of focus for cash from each campaign due to its 19 electoral votes and Harris is reportedly spending around US$195 million ($284 million) in ad buys in the state, as compared to Trump's US$78 million ($113 million).\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Trump and Harris square off in fiery debate SBS News 11/09/2024 09:23 Play\n\nMichigan and Georgia are then the second and third priorities for both Harris and Trump, with both candidates investing heavily in ad buys in those states.\n\n\n\n\n\nSmith said the focus on swing states by presidential candidates can mean other areas of the country are comparatively ignored.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is another controversial thing about the electoral college, is that it means the election campaign is just fought in somewhere between five and 10 states.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I was in Pennsylvania earlier this year, and just whenever you turn on the TV, it's just election ad after election ad, and 20 minutes down the road in New Jersey, you wouldn't have seen the same thing.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWant more politics?

        "text": "Vanderbilt elections course breaks record as largest elective class in the university\u2019s history\nWith 1,100 enrolled students, the number speaks for itself\u2014PSCI 1150: U.S. Elections is a hot commodity on campus. The elective course offered every four years by the College of Arts and Science is a highly anticipated deep dive into how elections work in the U.S., blending a robust understanding of history with extensive research from political science.\n\nJohn Geer\u2014the Gertrude Conaway Vanderbilt Professor of Political Science, co-director of the Vanderbilt Poll, and leader of the Vanderbilt Project on Unity and American Democracy\u2014had the idea for the class in 1996 with now-retired Professor Bruce Oppenheimer. Although the roster of professors has shifted since those initial Clinton vs. Dole days, the popularity of the class hasn\u2019t waned. Originally held in Wilson Hall, the course started with 200 enrollees in the 1990s. Today it\u2019s held in Langford Auditorium for a four-hour block on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons. The auditorium has a 1,104-seat capacity.\n\n\u201cThe elections course has always sought to be a special experience for students, being offered once every four years as we blend the actual campaign with the deep scholarship on the topic,\u201d Geer said. \u201cThe 2024 class has taken things to a new level with the historic size, the unprecedented nature of the 2024 campaign, noteworthy speakers and a group of talented students helping the class.\u201d\n\nThis year, the class is co-taught by Geer and a trio of political science professors:\n\nJosh Clinton , Abby and Jon Winkelried Professor of Political Science, co-director of the Vanderbilt Poll, and senior election analyst for NBC News\n\n, Abby and Jon Winkelried Professor of Political Science, co-director of the Vanderbilt Poll, and senior election analyst for NBC News Nicole Hemmer , associate professor of history and director of the Rogers Center for the American Presidency\n\n, associate professor of history and director of the Rogers Center for the American Presidency Jon Meacham, Carolyn T. and Robert M. Rogers Professor of Political Science and Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning presidential biographer\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure that the class is apolitical in the sense that it is not taking a side,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cOur goal is to help our students become better able to understand the context and significance of what they are observing in the current election given all that we know from history and political science about the nature of politics and elections.\u201d\n\nAccording to the course description, the class covers past elections (e.g., 1800, 1860, 1992), the nomination process and campaigning. Geer also lined up prominent guest speakers to shed light on pressing topics and offer a sense of the United States\u2019 contemporary, and often divisive, politics. These special guests include:\n\nAriel Edwards-Levy , editor of polling and elections analytics at CNN\n\n, editor of polling and elections analytics at CNN Charlane Oliver , Tennessee state senator for District 19\n\n, Tennessee state senator for District 19 John Lapinski , Robert A. Fox Professor of Political Science at the University of Pennsylvania\n\n, Robert A. Fox Professor of Political Science at the University of Pennsylvania George Stephanopoulos , television host, political commentator and former White House communications director under Bill Clinton\n\n, television host, political commentator and former White House communications director under Bill Clinton Chris Krebs, former director of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency\n\nStudents have also taken an active role by sharing what they\u2019ve learned from the class with the public, creating a dedicated VU Elections 2024 blog and Instagram account.\n\nAfter the November elections, the class will turn their attention to assessing what happened and the implications for governing beginning in January 2025.",

        "text": "U.S. presidential election: The phrase the right uses to explain why it's OK that Trump makes things up.\nAt an Oct. 5 rally in Pennsylvania, Donald Trump told a seemingly apocryphal story about a decades-old women\u2019s weightlifting record that was purportedly broken with ease by a man who had \u201cnever lifted before\u201d but cheated the system by identifying as trans. A Canadian women\u2019s powerlifter named April Hutchinson, who seemed to believe that the former president was referring to a specific trans rival of hers from the province of Alberta, posted a clip of the anecdote (which Trump tells frequently) on Twitter/X. The details Hutchinson gave, though, don\u2019t really line up with the vague scenario that Trump describes in his stump speech, in which he sometimes claims to have watched actual footage of a woman losing a competition to the trans lifter in question.\n\nFortunately Jay Richards, director of the DeVos Center for Life, Religion, and Family at the right-wing Heritage Foundation think tank, was there to square the circle. \u201cClassic Trump hyperbole,\u201d he declared. \u201cDirectionally correct but carefully engineered to drive critics crazy over the details.\u201d Problem solved: Trump wasn\u2019t exaggerating, and he definitely wasn\u2019t just getting mad about something that never happened\u2014he was being directionally correct.\n\nAnd being directionally correct\u2014or sometimes directionally accurate\u2014is, according to many of Donald Trump\u2019s supporters, something that Donald Trump is very good at. His claims about trans athletes, immigrants, and the 2020 election might not be strictly true, these advocates say, but they are directionally so, because he\u2019s talking about a real problem, or at least a feeling that there\u2019s a real problem.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated From Slate Trump Is Doing His Best to Make the Hurricane Into a Bad Issue for Him Read More\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s hyperbole is directionally accurate and benign,\u201d wrote Scott Adams, the Dilbert creator\u2013turned\u2013right-wing thought leader, after the presidential debate in June during which Trump (for example) described Jan. 6 rioters as \u201ca relatively small number of people that went to the Capitol and in many cases were ushered in by the police.\u201d On Fox News, host Greg Gutfeld said the same thing. \u201cTrump doesn\u2019t lie more than Biden,\u201d Gutfeld elaborated. \u201cHe lies better.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s defenders responded similarly to his outburst, in the second presidential debate, about illegal Haitian immigrants in Ohio stealing and eating U.S.-born Americans\u2019 pets. That rumor had no basis in reality; not only were Springfield, Ohio\u2019s Haitian residents not eating pets, they had also been admitted legally through a refugee program created by an act of Congress in 1990. Trump\u2019s running mate, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, nonetheless told reporters that he planned to continue to refer to the individuals in question as \u201cillegal aliens\u201d because he considered the refugee program to be \u201cfundamentally\u201d illegal. Directionally, in other words, he believed Trump was accurate about who should and should not be in the United States.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLawyerly justifications of Trump\u2019s bogus claims are Vance\u2019s stock in trade, but he doesn\u2019t appear to have used the phrase directionally correct himself. He did endorse a book by far-right conspiracy theorist Jack Posobiec, though, that lays out what might be the ultimate theory of directional honesty in a passage that attempts to explain why its premise\u2014that the United States is controlled by repressive communists\u2014is a fair one despite the abundant evidence that the United States is not controlled by repressive communists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSomething is deeply wrong with the way things are going and you know it. You may not be able to explain it with studies, surveys, or statistics, but you feel it. You\u2019ve felt this way for a while. Like there\u2019s some outside force or group or \u2026 something \u2026 that\u2019s sent us all off course from the libertarian utopia we should\u2019ve achieved by now. It doesn\u2019t seem like one -ism or -ation is entirely to blame, like globalism or immigration, capitalism or inflation. \u2026 Evidence of the unhuman activity is everywhere we look. But can we really pin all those on communists? Nobody pays attention to CPUSA. And there hasn\u2019t been a Carmelite nun\u2013style massacre. Or mass arrest and torture of landlords. But they\u2019re arresting landlords in New York City, now. And yet \u2026 the history of the revolution \u2026 the present day \u2026 it feels directionally accurate, doesn\u2019t it?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDoes it? (It does appear that a New York landlord was arrested in March for repeatedly failing to address cockroach violations. Classic instance of communism.)\n\nA claim that is directionally correct, it seems, is simply one that the person using the phrase wants to be true. The phrase is commonly used in the business world: It pops up often in transcripts of earnings calls, and a satirical 2014 Forbes piece about management consulting jargon defined it as a useful way to describe a theory that is not supported by the numbers that are supposed to support it. The consulting firm McKinsey & Company actually puts out a weekly crossword (what a world!) whose rules note that answers that are \u201cdirectionally correct\u201d but not actually correct should not be used. (Very cheeky, McKinsey & Company!)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAppropriately, the first instance of the phrase in the Nexis news database is attributed to Donald Rumsfeld\u2014a man whose career spanned both business and politics, and who is pound-for-pound probably one of the most full-of-shit people in American history. Rumsfeld\u2019s life as a national figure began with his service in the teemingly criminal Nixon administration\u2014Richard Nixon called him a \u201cruthless little bastard,\u201d high praise considering the source\u2014and ended with a five-year tenure as secretary of defense for George W. Bush, during which he advocated for the invasion of Iraq on the basis of weapons-of-mass-destruction programs and ties to al-Qaida that didn\u2019t turn out to exist.\n\nIn 1982, though, Rumsfeld was serving as CEO of a pharmaceutical company when the United Press International wire service contacted him to ask about Ronald Reagan\u2019s economic policies. Reagan had come into office promising to cut taxes, and he argued that this would actually increase federal revenue by stimulating economic growth and creating a bigger pie from which the government could take its slice. This didn\u2019t actually happen under Reagan and hasn\u2019t happened when any other presidents have tried it either, but Rumsfeld felt that the idea was \u2026 well, you know:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDonald Rumsfeld, former White House chief of staff and former defense secretary, agreed Reagan \u201dhas set us at least on the right path. We don\u2019t know if his economic approach will work,\u201d Rumsfeld said, but we have learned earlier approaches did not work.\n\n\u201dIt is important to leave it in place long enough to see if it does work,\u201d said Rumsfield, now chief executive officer of G.D. Searle. \u201dHe gets very high marks for being directionally correct.\u201d\n\nRumsfeld, who died in 2021, would have loved Trump\u2019s campaign this cycle, which accuses the Biden administration of creating lawless open borders, runaway crime rates, and out-of-control inflation during a year in which undocumented border crossings, crime rates, and inflation are all falling. If you can convince enough people that the country is headed in the wrong direction, it ultimately doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re correct or not.",

While you're probably busy deciding which candidate to vote for, the primary executive election was held in Crow Agency on Saturday.\n\nPiper Blackburn/AP Voting stations are set up for the primary election at the Kentucky Exposition Center, Monday, June 22, 2020, in Louisville, Ky. With one polling place designated for Louisville on Tuesday, voters who didn\u2019t cast mail-in ballots could potentially face long lines in Kentucky\u2019s unprecedented primary election. (AP Photo/Piper Blackburn)\n\nWhile many Americans think of Election Day as a stressful time, over at Crow Agency, their day is a festival filled with food and music.\n\n\"It's just tradition. Ever since we've had elections, this has just been a part of the process. You cook, you feed everybody, and it's just a good time to celebrate,\" says Levi BlackEagle, the Crow Secretary.\n\nAll around Crow Agency, candidates host parties and cook for voters, as a way to express gratitude.\n\n\"Well, we're offering meals today, because everybody's vote is important. We encourage everybody to get out and vote. One single vote is very important to all of the candidates... Good luck to all of the candidates,\" says Channise Whiteman, the Crow Vice Secretary.\n\nMack Carmack, MTN News Channise D. Whiteman (Crow Vice Secretary) & Lawrence DeCrane (Vice Chairman)\n\nWhere the U.S. Presidential Election is between two candidates, an election on Crow Agency consists of four different positions: Chairman, Vice Chairman, Secretary, and Vice Secretary.\n\n\"Behind the scenes, there's a lot of moving pieces,\" said BlackEagle.\n\nInstead of parties, candidates are a part of factions, and they run together as a slate.\n\nA slate is a campaign strategy where multiple candidates will run together with a similar political stance. For instance the WhiteClay slate/ \"Strength and Stability\" slate is made up by Frank WhiteClay (Chairman), Lawrence DeCrane (Vice Secretary), Levi BlackEagle (Secretary), and Channise D. Whiteman (Vice Secretary).\n\n\"That's part of the strengths of having a slate come together. You'll see some of the candidates, they're just by themselves. So, they're doing everything by themselves,\" BlackEagle said.\n\nMack Carmack, MTN News Levi BlackEagle, Crow Secretary\n\nOn the reservation, candidates work and self-fund all of the meals and campaigning. Meaning, the thousands of free meals offered on Saturday, came out of pocket.\n\n\"We're not allowed to get outside money. What I mean by 'outside money' is any non-tribal member or entity can't donate to our campaigns,\" BlackEagle said.\n\nThe general election is set for Saturday, Nov. 2. So, candidates like BlackEagle, Whiteman, and DeCrane are busy campaigning for their second term.\n\n\"Strength and Stability,' that's for the whole Crow People, basically. That's who we're working for,\" says DeCrane.",

Host of the CNN series African Voices Changemakers.\n\nTranscript\n\nPart I\n\nMEGHNA CHAKRABARTI: When Americans cast their ballots on November 6th in the U.S. presidential election, their votes will not just influence the lives of all of their fellow Americans. The next president of the United States will also have a global impact. That's because the outcome of the 2024 U.S. presidential election will have repercussions on what happens in the war in Ukraine, in the Middle East, in Gaza, in Lebanon.\n\nIt will impact international trade and tariffs. It'll shape border policy and immigration policy. It will even have an impact on global democracy. So this hour, we will be looking at three regions of the world, Europe, Latin America, and Africa, to hear about why how you vote matters to the rest of the world.\n\nAnd we will start in Europe. Michal Baranowski is the Managing Director of the East Program of the German Marshall Fund and our nonpartisan transatlantic think tank, and he joins us from Warsaw, Poland. Michal, welcome to On Point.\n\nMICHAL BARANOWSKI: It's great to be with you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCHAKRABARTI: So just about every U.S. presidential election is of keen interest to the world.\n\nBut how consequential would you say this 2024 election is for Europeans?\n\nBARANOWSKI: You're right that every U.S. election is important, but this feels like it's perhaps the most important U.S. election for Europe, for transatlantic relations in perhaps as long as a generation. Has to do both with the stark contrast between the two candidates, but perhaps even more importantly, the election comes in a very tumultuous time in our history, both in Europe, with the Russian war in Ukraine, but also with the broader instability in the Middle East. So right on the borders of Europe, we have two ongoing wars, and U.S. is a key ally of Europe and a key player when it comes to European security, when it comes to European prosperity, but also to the future of European democracy.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: So it's one thing to hear an analyst say this could be the most consequential election for Europe in a generation.\n\nBut how would you measure the truth of that in terms of what average Europeans think or are seeing and hearing about the U.S. election.\n\nBARANOWSKI: What I notice here in Poland, but also when I travel throughout Europe to Berlin, Paris, London, Brussels, is that really everyone I talk with, and grant you, I do talk with people from the analytical bubble, but perhaps even more broadly, a driver in a taxi or a friend just on the street, everyone asks about what will happen in U.S. presidential election.\n\nEveryone seems to be following it very carefully. In my view, in my observation, many of the Europeans follow the U.S. politics more closely than they follow their domestic politics at the moment because what happens in the U.S. matters so much for us here in Europe.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: So then, take me through the first couple of reasons why that is.\n\nAnd obviously, first of all, is the long-standing U.S.-European alliance. Let's focus on NATO for a moment. As you mentioned, very clearly, the two nominees have different viewpoints of the NATO alliance, right? Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized NATO, he's aligned his speaking with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Vice President Kamala Harris thus far has said that she will hold the line on America's active participation in NATO, just as obviously for background for everybody. So tell me more about how Europeans view that difference, because it is a stark one, as you said.\n\nBARANOWSKI: Absolutely. NATO is what keeps us safe. And by us, both us Europeans and us Atlanticists. So you, in that sense, Americans as well.\n\nAnd that alliance has been strong over the last 75 years. We just celebrated it in with a summit in Washington this summer. Importantly, it has gotten stronger, especially in the last few years, with Europeans spending more on defense and the whole alliance beefing up its capabilities, because the situation on our borders has gotten so much more dangerous.\n\nIt is not just a matter of words. It's really a matter of survival, whether NATO works well, and whether NATO is able to deter, especially in this case, Russia, that is fighting an aggressive war just on our borders. I'm speaking to you from Warsaw, which is under 200 kilometers from borders with Russia and Belarus.\n\nIt's 600, 700 kilometers from the active front in Ukraine. So the stakes are very high. And when we look to the two candidates, we see Vice President Kamala Harris, who talks very openly about support for NATO, for the role it has played for U.S. interests. And that is very much an expectation of continuation of this course.\n\nWhen we Europeans listen to President Trump or former President Trump, or his vice president. This is where there are lots of concerns, mostly with the rhetoric, because we also do remember, and especially many of the countries here on the eastern flank, that in fact, last time, President Trump, as a president of the United States, did not weaken NATO. In fact, but he did beat it up rhetorically.\n\nBut now the stakes are even higher with the war on our shores. We really cannot afford anyone to put any doubt or a question mark over whether U.S. And NATO as a whole would come to defense of our allies. And that's something that former President Trump did say very publicly.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: Point well taken on that.\n\nIn addition though, a lot of what former President Trump talked about, again, rhetorically, as you said, during his first presidency, was he made it sound like NATO member nations were supposed to pay the United States for transatlantic defense. That's not true, right? The truth is that NATO member nations are expected to pay 2% of their budgets for defense spending, for their own defense spending.\n\nBut to Donald Trump's point, then, not all member nations actually met that spending commitment for quite some time. And in fact, it was only recently in 2024, and I would say because of what's happening in Ukraine, that the number of NATO member nations meeting that 2% rose dramatically.\n\nAnd I'm seeing here, according to one count, that now it's 23 of 32 have, are now spending that 2%. I do wonder if though the rhetoric was charged and full of misinformation, whether it did actually wake up NATO as a whole, as to what its own responsibilities were in holding the alliance together.\n\nBARANOWSKI: There is no question and there is really an agreement that Donald Trump was right, that Europe needs to spend more on defense, needs to step up, that we need to step up for our own defense. And as you said, 23 out of 32 nations are doing it right now. I'm speaking to you from Poland, that is not only spending that required 2%, but we are spending 3.2% and going to the 4.2% and going to 4.7% of GDP on defense, which is actually higher percentage than the United States.\n\nAnd yes, it's true that President Trump brought this to focus as, frankly, did previous presidents, as well. Going all the way back to, I think, Kennedy at the very least, he brought it in different, more perhaps like rent terms. But it is certainly president Putin that made us really take these responsibility more seriously. And that's why you see high spending, especially on the Eastern front. But again, Europeans more broadly reaching the levels that we agreed on and, but on that point, there is appreciation, especially on the Eastern flank, perhaps, of Donald Trump bringing this to very strong attention of everyone in the Alliance.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: Now I wonder, we'll talk more about how Europeans view Vice President Harris a little bit later in the show.\n\nBut I've been using this blanket term, Europeans, but obviously it's a very diverse continent and within that we've also seen a rise of kind of right-wing populism in Europe, just as we have in the United States. And obviously thinking of Hungary, Italy, even President Erdo\u011fan in Turkey.\n\nI just, I wonder there, there must be some European states that are more aligned with a future Trump presidency than misaligned.\n\nBARANOWSKI: That's certainly true. We began speaking about security, and in that context, we can talk about Europeans as a group, because for everyone who is at NATO and most of the European countries are, with the exceptions of really few, it is critical to have us involved in European security.\n\nBut when we look to domestic politics. Yes, there will be alignments with Donald Trump. If he was to win elections in the U.S. you pointed out to Hungary where Victor Orban, prime minister of Hungary, works very closely with the President Trump's team, also perhaps sharing some lessons from Hungary over the last few years. But there are also right-wing parties, especially right-wing parties, more nativist parties, sovereigntist parties in other countries that are not yet in the government, but that would certainly be aligned with the worldview. And that's true both in big countries like France and Germany and smaller countries as well, where those parties might reach the government very soon.\n\nPart II\n\nCHAKRABARTI: I want to shift for the moment to Latin America. And Denise Dresser joins us. She's a Mexican political analyst and columnist and a professor of political science at the Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico Aut\u00f3nomo de M\u00e9xico, and she's in Mexico City.\n\nProfessor Dresser, welcome to you.\n\nDENISE DRESSER: Thank you. Great to be on the show.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: So of all the foreign policy issues that are reverberating most powerfully here in the United States, it's immigration that's number one on that foreign policy list, for obvious reasons. So could you give me your analysis as to how Latin American countries are seeing the immigration debate as it plays out in the United States?\n\nDRESSER: I think this affects a multiplicity of countries that have immigration issues with the U.S. Venezuela, Nicaragua, El Salvador, but most importantly, my country, Mexico. Mexicans are viewing this election with trepidation and with fear. Because we already lived through a Trump presidency and know what that entails.\n\nHe used the immigration issue as a cudgel to extract a series of concessions from Mexico on other fronts. And now his rhetoric has become even more inflammatory and is resonating throughout the continent. For example, he said that he's going to deport over 12 million immigrants regardless of their legal status.\n\nThat he once again is going to try and close the border. That he, in the case of Mexico, might use military force against drug traffickers, or might even bomb parts of Mexico's territory. And having lived through the four years of his last presidency, that forced Mexico to do a series of things that have placed us in a very difficult situation.\n\nFor example, Donald Trump threatened to put tariffs on a series of Mexican products, violating, by the way, the free trade agreement that exists between Canada, the United States and Mexico. If we didn't control immigration and act as a de facto border wall and as a de facto border police, and that led to the militarization of immigration policy here.\n\nThe militarized National Guard spends 90% of its time basically chasing immigrants, to the detriment of public security issues in the country, for example. And we have a new president, a woman president, and in the past, Trump was able to impose a series of things because Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who I would call an authoritarian populist, bowed to him and accepted these terms and they had a good relationship. Because they spoke the same language, had a similar temperament, and Trump was willing to look away from Mexico's democratic backsliding over the last six years.\n\nSo this was a kind of pact with the devil. And we, Democrats in Mexico, are concerned about the resurrection of that pact and also about the relationship that could emerge between a man like Donald Trump, and we know how he tends to treat women and how he would interact with our new female Mexican president.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: So let me follow up on a couple of things there. Because these are very important points. So first of all, Mexico's new president being Claudia Sheinbaum and but she, at least, through the Mexican election was very closely aligned with L\u00f3pez Obrador, right? Do we know clearly what her view of border issues are between Mexico and the United States?\n\nOr has she spoken about it in sympathetic terms to what came before in Mexico?\n\nDRESSER: She has not expressed a very clear stance. I think the situation in Mexico and in Latin America right now is we're holding our breath to see what happens. In some ways, Trump coming back into office would be functional for her in so far as the U.S. kept silent on democratic backsliding and her close alliance with L\u00f3pez Obrador and her pushing forward his agenda on a series of issues that many of us consider threatening to Mexico's very fragile democracy, that might work well for her. What wouldn't work well is Trump stands, for example, on unilateral moves regarding drug trafficking and violence in Mexico.\n\nThere was a reason, the incursion to find a very notorious Mexican trafficker and take him to the U.S. And arrest him and she's adopted a stance of national sovereignty, of defending Mexico against U.S. incursions and of supporting some of the issues. That L\u00f3pez Obrador left on her plate that are clear violations of Mexico's international commitments under free trade.\n\nSo I think trade issues, tariffs, protectionism, immigration are going to be key. And that's why there's so much concern, because of Trump's previous stances. And also because of the alignment that Claudia Sheinbaum may have with him. Or not, I think it's a big question mark.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: Yeah, that's a very important form of uncertainty to understand in Mexico itself.\n\nIn a minute or two, I want to talk about the rest of Latin America, but sticking with the Mexico-U.S. border for a moment, Vice President Harris was charged by the Biden administration to look at specifically what the United States could do to reduce migration from other Latin American countries.\n\nAnd in terms of, we've heard for a long time about increasing the economies and the safety of people in those nations, such that the need for migration would be reduced. There's no measurable difference between before her taking on that task and now, so I do wonder what you think about a potential Harris presidency, whether that would be a functional change, if at all, to this really complex and challenging issue of Western hemispheric migration.\n\nI'd say that in Latin America, Kamala Harris is unknown. People are not going to come out and tell you what they understand her legacy to be or what she did, because there seems to be, as you said correctly, no major difference. In this approach of going to the source of immigration, the push factors has not worked. Because unfortunately, we're seeing a trend in many countries in Latin America towards authoritarian populism.\n\nAnd, for example, that has been the case now for many years in Venezuela. And that's pushing people out, basically the collapse of the Venezuelan economy and insecurity in many other areas that has to do with the region's lack of growth and inability to really reemerge economically after COVID.\n\nMany analysts in Mexico are talking, and in the region are talking about perhaps another lost decade of economic growth. And I'd say that's the primordial push factor. I'd say economic collapse. Also, insecurity, violence and drug violence. The region is plagued by the strengthening of criminal organizations and the rerouting of drug trafficking roots throughout the hemisphere, and how that's affecting domestic politics in many places, and it's not clear to us that the U.S. actually has a solution for this. Because as these drugs come from Colombia or Mexico to the U.S. Market. The United States is the main source of demand, and we're not seeing anything that's going to change that equation under either presidents.\n\nAnd the question for Kamala Harris, she willing to go to really take a comprehensive look at immigration, beyond what the Biden administration did? Which was basically continue with the Trump pact of, we'll be silent on democracy issues in Mexico as long as you stop immigrants from crossing the border.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: Yeah. Michael Baranowski, I know you're still there listening patiently with us. I do have an important question that reflects the issues of Latin America in the European Union. But hang on for just a moment, because Professor Dresser, there's a follow up that I want to ask you. Because as, look, in the United States, about the view of Americans is quite, there's a broad spectrum of views about those push factors, as you were talking about.\n\nAnd I think a growing number of Americans, in fact, we know a growing number of Americans say it's not the U.S.'s business to try and clean up the messes in some of these Latin American countries that are producing those push factors. And therefore, and you could also say that in previous generations, whenever the United States decided to become more actively involved in Latin America, it succeeded in simply people in Mexico or even Latin America more broadly think of the American populace's dwindling desire to be active participants in Latin American policy and politics.\n\nDRESSER: I understand those views, but unfortunately, they don't reflect reality. Our countries are interconnected in so many ways. And for example, the opioid crisis stems from a very high demand for the drug in the United States.\n\nI think it's completely false to argue, as JD Vance has said, that Mexico is the main cause of this. There's a demand issue in the U.S. that is not addressed. And there's another, I think, important theme that we haven't touched upon, which is the U.S. sends guns, sells guns to multiple criminal organizations that buy them.\n\nAlong the border states and then take them to Mexico and to other countries in the region. And I think there's an enormous degree of responsibility on the part of any U.S. Administration. Now, regarding the United States pulling back. Of course, Latin American countries do not want to see interventions that topple democratic governments or that lead to military coups, which was the history of American intervention in the 20th century.\n\nBut in the 21st century, I think many thought that Biden would be true to his rhetoric and support efforts to maintain fragile democracies in Latin America. And the U.S. pulled back in a way that was, I think, very detrimental to Latin America, in so far as it just let democratic backsliding continue without taking a strong stance. And I think on those issues that have to do with democratic rule, with human rights, with climate change and with even peace negotiations in the region, the U.S. had very bad policy towards Venezuela, for example, and now is no longer a legitimate player in the region.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut that void, unfortunately, and I'm glad you brought this up, has been filled by the increased presence, economically, in terms of investment, of China. And China is willing to do business with autocrats in Latin America and the government growing geopolitical presence as well of Russia, that is intervening in Latin American elections, pushing polarization, pushing fake news and trying to support authoritarian alternatives throughout Latin America.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: So we will hear, when we talk about Africa in a few minutes, we'll probably hear an echo of that theme. Professor Dresser, Michael Baranowski, let me turn back to you. And again, I appreciate your patience on this, but I did want to ask you about the question of migration in the European context. Because obviously I would say that it's been thorny, to put it lightly, in Europe.\n\nAnd in fact, mass migration is one of the things that has helped empower those far-right nativist parties and groups in Europe that we were talking about earlier. So walk me through how the sort of migration issue in the Western Hemisphere, how Europeans may look about that, look upon that, and then, considering similar issue, similar situation in Europe, in the context of the U.S. election and what might happen there.\n\nBARANOWSKI: Migration is certainly one of the key central issues. Political issues in Europe, as well. It seems to be a global phenomenon or at least a phenomenon in the West. So it's very high on the agenda, as you said, and the issue is being vilified and used especially by right wing parties.\n\nNow, at the moment there, and there are two sources of migration, perhaps three for Europe, South, Southeast and also East, being the war in Ukraine. That created millions of displaced people. Now all this is playing into the hands of right-wing populists.\n\nAnd some of this rhetorics gets picked up also by more center right governments or parties. But that's one area where it seems to be not directly impacted by who wins in U.S. election, the narratives and politics are similar, but the decisions that United States can take are a little bit more disconnected with one difference, and the difference relates directly to the war in Ukraine, because If U.S. was to pull out and pull back the support and it would create a loss in Ukraine, loss of the war, then we would see a wave of additional millions of Ukrainians who will have to flee. And that would certainly have an impact on Europe as well.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: So I hear your point that there may be a much more insignificant direct impact of the U.S. president on European migration issues, obviously in comparison to Latin America, but earlier you talked about the fragility of some democracies in Europe, and I wonder if the rhetorical impact, or the example, say Donald Trump is returned to the White House, and he does institute his incredibly hard line on immigration, could that further empower or provide an example for the very parties that you're speaking about in Europe?\n\nBARANOWSKI: Certainly. But the impact is perhaps a little bit broader, because it's more about what Donald Trump would do within the whole context of U.S. democracy, it's institutions, especially rule of law. Immigration and migration debates as well, that would have a very profound impact on Europe, because American democracy remains the example also for our democracies here in Europe and for democracies around the world.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: Yeah. So this brings us back to I think, your overall point, I should say, which is that there is a massive tension between what might be an advisable, truly advisable U.S. foreign policy versus what it sounds like candidates feel like they have to say or the postures that they have to take to project strength in the course of a U.S. Yeah. election, right?\n\nThat ultimately they, the candidates, if they win, may feel the need to follow through on some of the promises they made, but those promises weren't with thinking actually, this would be a good thing for the U.S. to do abroad. I also wonder, though, if that tension leads us naturally to candidates like Donald Trump, one of his appeals to his most fervent supporters is his constant supposed projection of strength, and that now has come along with a very absolutist foreign policy as we saw under his first administration, if we're all always voting on vibes, that seems to be a natural conclusion in terms of the kind of candidates we'd get.\n\nFRIEDMAN: Yeah, and it's no secret that the Trump campaign wants to highlight the candidates perceived leadership strength and that does seem to be an asset for him. So a Gallup poll taken two weeks ago showed that Trump had a 10-point lead nationally in terms of who would be a stronger and more decisive leader.\n\nThe poll from the Institute for Global Affairs showed Trump had an eight-point lead in battleground states on who would be a stronger leader in international affairs. So the history suggests that kind of image resonates with voters. I think this is a place where we can help make sense of Trump's appeal to voters, even if his foreign policy positions are unusual. So a lot of Trump's America First policies. For example, in this election, the idea of placing double digit tariffs on all imports is quite outside the mainstream for U.S. foreign policy. And when asked if voters agree with those positions, they generally say no.\n\nSo if we thought that individual foreign policy issues were what mattered in the politics of foreign policy, It would seem like Trump's America First agenda is a bad thing for him politically, but if you think that Trump, like many other candidates, uses his foreign policy positions as a way of crafting an image of being a strong and decisive leader, then we can see that kind of strategy resonates with exactly the strategies many other presidential candidates have taken in the past.\n\nAnd I think that's one place where Trump, even though he's often seen as being outside the norms of U.S. politics, has actually been hewing to a strategy that has a lot of historical background to it.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: We just have a couple of minutes left here, and I want to bring it back to Vice President Harris, because you write very interestingly that, quote, an upcoming election can make the task of resolving international crises both more urgent and more difficult.\n\nNow I'm thinking about Israel-Gaza, and you heard that tape a little earlier we played from Harris's DNC speech, where she promised Israel, Israeli security and a Palestinian state as well. Those are promises she's making in the context of an election, as you pointed out. But on the other hand, if she wins the White House she will be dealing with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has said, he and those surrounding him have said, in no uncertain terms, the hope for a two state solution is gone.\n\nIs this one of those examples of, it may be making it much more difficult to resolve this international crisis? Because what incentive would Netanyahu have to negotiate in good faith with a new president who said she wants a second, she wants a Palestinian state?\n\nFRIEDMAN: I think that's right. History shows that the dynamics of an upcoming election can make it very difficult for presidents to negotiate in foreign policy.\n\nAnd in this case, the clear block is that Netanyahu has every incentive to roll the dice and hope that Trump is the next U.S. president. Trump has been very clear that he wants to let Israel, quote, finish the job in Gaza. As you talked about earlier in the program, it's not exactly clear how Democrats would try to straddle support for Israel with empathy towards Gaza, but it's clear that would come with, a Trump administration would have fewer constraints for Israel than a Harris one would.\n\nAnd as a result of that, Israel has very little incentive to try to tamp down the war before the election. At the same time, the Biden administration presumably doesn't want to alienate pro Israel voters. And that makes it difficult for them to take much more aggressive positions in the short term.\n\nI would say, if Harris wins the presidency, then she would have much more freedom to put constraints on Israel if that's what she wants to do. But I think it makes a lot of sense that any of those constraints would have to wait until after Election Day, just given the difficulty of straddling that those two constituencies in the Democratic party right now.",

(Canva, ABC News: Elissa Steedman)\n\nElectors are actual people representing their area and vote according to the local results.\n\nIt differs between states how these electors are chosen and how many each jurisdiction has to represent them, but they're generally chosen by political parties.\n\nCalifornia has the most electoral college votes with 54, while other states have as few as three.\n\nHere's a basic view of how it works:\n\nVoters cast their ballot for president, which goes toward a statewide tally With the exception of two states that use a proportional system, the winner of the statewide tally gets all the electoral votes for that state A presidential candidate needs the vote of at least 270 electors to win the election\n\nThe Electoral College won't make its official vote on the next president until mid-December but we'll know the result of the election much sooner.\n\nLoading...\n\nCan someone win the popular vote but lose the election?\n\nYes.\n\nIt\u2019s possible for a candidate to win the Electoral College vote despite not being the general public\u2019s choice.\n\nThis has happened only a handful of times:\n\n2016\n\n2000\n\n1888\n\n1874\n\n1826\n\nDonald Trump became president in 2016 despite millions more people voting for Hillary Clinton.\n\nThat\u2019s because the Republican Party managed to win the popular vote in enough heavy-hitting states like Texas (which, in 2016, had 38 electoral collage votes) and Pennsylvania (which had 20) to be awarded more electoral college spots.\n\nWhen will the president be sworn in?\n\nOn January 20, 2025.\n\nThe presidential oath \"I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.\"\n\nThat day is known as Inauguration Day and happens every four years on that date (or January 21 if the 20th falls on a Sunday).\n\nThe ceremony takes place at the Capitol building in Washington, DC.\n\nYou can expect to see the president-elect (what we call someone who has won the election but not yet been sworn in) recite the presidential oath and later give their inaugural address.",

        "text": "In an already unpredictable year, back-to-back hurricanes reshape 2024 presidential campaign\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A pair of unwelcome and destructive guests named Helene and Milton have stormed their way into this year\u2019s presidential election.\n\nThe back-to-back hurricanes have jumbled the schedules of Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump, both of whom devoted part of their recent days to tackling questions about the storm recovery effort.\n\nWATCH: Floridians tally damage after Hurricane Milton leaves path of destruction\n\nThe two hurricanes are forcing basic questions about who as president would best respond to deadly natural disasters, a once-overlooked issue that has become an increasingly routine part of the job. And just weeks before the Nov. 5 election, the storms have disrupted the mechanics of voting in several key counties.\n\nVice President Harris is trying to use this as an opportunity to project leadership, appearing alongside President Joe Biden at briefings and calling for bipartisan cooperation. Former President Trump is trying to use the moment to attack the administration\u2019s competence and question whether it is withholding help from Republican areas, despite no evidence of such behavior.\n\nAdding to the pressure is the need to provide more money for the Small Business Administration and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which would require House Republicans to work with the Democratic administration. Biden said Thursday that lawmakers should address the situation immediately.\n\n\u201cDealing with back-to-back crises will put FEMA under more scrutiny and, therefore, the Biden administration will be under a microscope in the days leading up to the election,\u201d said Timothy Kneeland, a professor at Nazareth University in Rochester, New York, who has studied the issue.\n\n\u201cVice President Harris must empathize with the victims without altering the campaign schedule and provide consistent messaging on the widespread devastation that makes FEMA\u2019s work even more challenging than normal,\u201d Kneeland added.\n\nAlready, Trump and Harris have separately gone to Georgia and North Carolina to assess hurricane damage and pledge support, requiring the candidates to cancel campaign events elsewhere and use up time that is a precious resource in the final weeks before any election. Both Georgia and North Carolina are political battlegrounds, raising the stakes.\n\nThe hurricane fallout is evident in the candidates\u2019 campaign events as well.\n\nOn Thursday, the first question Harris got at a Univision town hall in Las Vegas came from a construction worker and undecided voter from Tampa, Florida. Ramiro Gonzalez asked about talk that the administration has not done enough to support people after Helene and whether the people in Milton\u2019s path would have access to aid \u2014 a sign that Trump\u2019s messaging is breaking through with some potential voters.\n\nWATCH LIVE: Biden discusses federal response after hurricanes Helene and Milton strike U.S.\n\nHarris has called out the level of misinformation being circulated by Republicans, but her fuller answer revealed the dynamics at play just a few weeks before an election.\n\n\u201cI have to stress that this is not a time for people to play politics,\u201d she said.\n\nOn the same day, Trump opened his speech at the Detroit Economic Club by praising Republican governors in the affected states and blasting the Biden-Harris administration.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve let those people suffer unjustly,\u201d he said about those affected by Helene in North Carolina.\n\nThe storms have also scrambled the voting process in places. North Carolina \u2018s State Board of Elections has passed a resolution to help people in the state\u2019s affected counties vote. Florida will allow some counties greater flexibility in distributing mail-in ballots and changing polling sites for in-person voting. But a federal judge in Georgia said Thursday the state doesn\u2019t need to reopen voter registration despite the disruptions by Helene.\n\nTension and controversy have begun to override the disaster response, with Biden on Wednesday and Thursday saying that Trump has spread falsehoods that are \u201cun-American.\u201d\n\nCandace Bright Hall-Wurst, a sociology professor at East Tennessee State University, said that natural disasters have become increasingly politicized, often putting more of the focus on the politicians instead of the people in need.\n\n\u201cDisasters are politicized when they have political value to the candidate,\u201d she said. \u201cThis does not mean that the politicization is beneficial to victims.\u201d\n\nAs the Democratic nominee, Harris has suddenly been a major part of the response to hurricanes, a role that traditionally has not involved vice presidents in prior administrations.\n\nOn Thursday, she participated virtually at a Situation Room briefing on Milton while she was in Nevada for campaign activities. She has huddled in meetings about response plans and on Wednesday phoned into CNN live to discuss the administration\u2019s efforts.\n\nAt a Wednesday appearance with Biden to discuss Milton ahead of it making landfall, Harris subtly tied back the issues into her campaign policies to stop price gouging on food and other products.\n\n\u201cTo any company that \u2014 or individual that might use this crisis to exploit people who are desperate for help through illegal fraud or price gouging \u2014 whether it be at the gas pump, the airport, or the hotel counter \u2014 know that we are monitoring these behaviors and the situation on the ground very closely and anyone taking advantage of consumers will be held accountable,\u201d she said.\n\nHarris warned that Milton \u201cposes extreme danger.\u201d It made landfall in Florida late Wednesday and left more than 3 million without power. But the storm surge never reached the same levels as Helene, which led to roughly 230 fatalities and for a prolonged period left mountainous parts of North Carolina without access to electricity, cell service and roadways.\n\nTrump and his allies have seized on the aftermath of Helene to spread misinformation about the administration\u2019s response. Their debunked claims include statements that victims can only receive $750 in aid as well as false charges that emergency response funds were diverted to immigrants.\n\nThe former president said the administration\u2019s response to Helene was worse than the George W. Bush administration\u2019s widely panned handling of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which led to nearly 1,400 deaths.\n\n\u201cThis hurricane has been a bad one, Kamala Harris has left them stranded,\u201d Trump said at a recent rally in Juneau, Wisconsin. \u201cThis is the worst response to a storm or a catastrophe or a hurricane that we\u2019ve ever seen ever. Probably worse than Katrina, and that\u2019s hard to beat, right?\u201d\n\nAsked about the Trump campaign\u2019s strategic thinking on emphasizing the hurricane response, campaign press secretary Karoline Leavitt said it reflects a pattern of \u201cfailed leadership\u201d by the Biden-Harris administration that also includes the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan and security at the U.S. southern border.\n\n\u201cKamala has left Americans behind and proven she is not equipped to solve crises at the highest level,\u201d Leavitt said.\n\nJohn Gasper, a Carnegie Mellon University professor who has researched government responses to natural disasters, said storm victims generally want to ensure foremost that they get the aid they need.\n\n\u201cThese disasters essentially end up being good tests of leadership for local, state and federal officials in how they respond,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Gasper noted that U.S. politics have gotten so polarized and other issues such as the economy are shaping the election, such that the debate currently generating so much heat between Trump and the Biden-Harris administration might not matter that much on Election Day.\n\n\u201cOn the margin, it will matter,\u201d he said. \u201cWill it define the election? Probably not. There\u2019s so many other things out there.\u201d\n\nAP writer Adriana Gomez Licon contributed to this report.",

The Emerson College Polling survey highlighted that Harris's trump card for the presidential race lies in her popularity among Asian and young voters. However, she struggles with older voters and independents.\n\nMeanwhile, support for Donald Trump remains steady in key states like Wisconsin amid rising speculations that he might win here.\n\nIn addition, the union households also exert influence on the polls. The Emerson College polls have shown that in Pennsylvania, union households support Trump (53 per cent to 43 per cent), while Harris holds a slight edge among non-union voters (49 per cent to 48 per cent).\n\nVarious factors, such as demographics and union households, influence the polls, but economic concerns remain a top issue for voters in most states, with exceptions like Arizona, where immigration takes precedence for 30 per cent of voters.",

        "text": "Why Ohio is not considered a swing state in this year's presidential election \u2022 Ohio Capital Journal\nWinning Ohio used to be crucial to winning the presidential election. This year, not so much.\n\nOhio used to be a key swing state in the presidential election for decades \u2014 meaning lots of political ads and campaign stops \u2014 but the tide shifted back in 2016, said Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics.\n\n\u201cThere was this educational realignment that Donald Trump supercharged in 2016 and it had the effect of changing a lot of states,\u201d he said. \u201cStates like Ohio and Iowa went from being purple states to red states.\u201d\n\nThe candidates, the ballot measures, and the tools you need to cast your vote. 2024 Ohio Voter Guide\n\nFifty-one percent of Ohio voted for former President Trump in 2016, who went on to win the election despite losing the popular vote. Fifty-three percent of Ohio voted for Trump in 2020, but President Joe Biden won the election.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ll look at 2016, historically speaking, as an important realigning election politically in lots of different places, but particularly Ohio because that\u2019s when it went from being a state that was very reflective of the nation to one that wasn\u2019t reflective of the nation anymore,\u201d said Kondik, who wrote \u201cThe Bellwether: Why Ohio Picks the President.\u201d His book was published June 2016.\n\nTrump is expected to win Ohio, which has 17 electoral votes, for the third time in a row in 2024. A recent Washington Post poll showed him leading by six points. Neither Harris or Trump have made campaign stops in Ohio recently. Trump was last in Ohio leading up to the state\u2019s March primary to drum up support for U.S. Senate candidate Bernie Moreno, who ended up securing the Republican nomination and is going up against Ohio U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown in a pivotal race for control over that chamber.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a state that seems to be particularly competitive (in this presidential election),\u201d Kondik said.\n\nArizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin are the key battleground states in the election for Vice President Kamala Harris and Trump.\n\nOhio\u2019s history as a swing state\n\nUp until 2020, Ohio had voted for the overall winning presidential candidate in every election since 1964. No Republican has won the presidential election without winning Ohio. Former President Barack Obama was the last Democratic presidential candidate to win Ohio in 2012.\n\n\u201cTrump has proven to be particularly popular among working class whites in northeastern Ohio, Cleveland, Akron area, as well as in Appalachia,\u201d said Paul Beck, professor emeritus and academy professor of political science at Ohio State University.\n\nRepublican candidates across the board have had much success in Ohio.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve had more candidates who have statewide recognition or visibility,\u201d Beck said. \u201cDemocrats have been hard pressed to find candidates who had that kind of visibility that could compete evenly or better with them in elections.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s possible Ohio could be a swing state again in the future, but things would have to change.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always possible that the demographic patterns that we\u2019ve seen recently could change in a way that maybe makes the state more competitive,\u201d Kondik said. \u201cI do think it would involve Democrats making up some ground with white working class voters which it\u2019s been a struggle for them with that group, and they\u2019ve been losing ground for a long time amongst that group. I also think that the Democrats just have to get much more out of the suburban counties than they do.\u201d\n\nFollow OCJ Reporter Megan Henry on X.",

        "text": "Donald Trump to miss playing golf until after US President elections. Here\u2019s why\nEver since the assassination attempt near one of his golf courses last month, former US President Donald Trump has skipped his favourite sport and is not likely to hit the golf course soon.\n\nAccording to ABC News, citing sources, Trump will stay out of the golf course until a new security plan is in place. However, it is not expected to be in effect until after the November 5 US Presidential elections.\n\nDuring a briefing last month, the US Secret Service had expressed its concern to Trump over his golfing and told him that additional planning and security procedures are needed for him to be able to continue his golf outings.\n\nTrump, who owns several golf courses, typically plays on a regular basis.\n\nTalking to ABC News, a Secret Service spokesperson said since the attempted assassination of the former President on July 13, the US Secret Service has made comprehensive changes and enhancements to our communications capabilities, resourcing, and protective operations.\n\n\"Today, the former President is receiving heightened protection, and we take the responsibility to ensure his safety and security very seriously,\" Secret Service Chief of Communications Anthony Guglielmi added.\n\nAlso Read | JD Vance refused five times to acknowledge Donald Trump lost 2020 election in podcast interview\n\nOn September 30, the man charged with attempting to assassinate Trump at the former president's golf club in Florida, Ryan Routh, 58, pleaded not guilty to federal charges.\n\nOn the day of the alleged attempted assassination, Trump was playing golf on the course when a US Secret Service agent spotted a gun barrel poking out from the tree line near the sixth green, according to investigators.\n\nRouth was arrested after allegedly fleeing the scene. He has been ordered to remain in jail to await trial, which has been ordered for November 18.\n\nHowever, the trial date could be delayed based on the complexity of the case.",

        "text": "Maryland Today: AI-Generated Misinformation is Everywhere. ID\u2019ing It May Be Harder Than You Think (ft. Jen Golbeck)\nChris Carroll | Maryland Today Staff | UMD - October 11, 2024\n\nUMD Experts Explain the Emotional Pulls and Cognitive Pitfalls\u2014and How to Avoid Them\n\nFrom Taylor Swift to the fate of family pets to hurricane relief, disinformation has covered a wide range of topics in the run-up to the 2024 election, and AI has played a key role in powering its spread on social media and elsewhere. Photos by Adobe Stock AI and Shutterstock\n\nthe_post_thumbnail_caption(); ?>\n\nArtificial though it may be, the concept of \u201cintelligence\u201d doesn\u2019t seem to jibe with a computer-generated image of uniformed cats toting assault rifles.\n\nYet that visual slur, which supports a debunked story about immigrants in Ohio eating pets, has become a signature image from the 2024 U.S. presidential election. It was created using artificial intelligence (AI) by supporters of Republican nominee Donald Trump and circulated online by the former president himself.\n\nAs the first election to play out in the era of widespread access to generative AI\u2014which can create seemingly original content\u2014disreputable websites and our social media feeds have featured a deluge of fabricated and misleading text and visuals.\n\nTo learn more about the role of this technology in the contest, Maryland Today spoke to three University of Maryland faculty experts: College of Information Professor Jennifer Golbeck, who studies social media algorithms and the spread of extremist content; linguistics Professor Philip Resnik, who pursues computational approaches to language and psychology with a joint appointment in the Institute for Advanced Computer Studies; and journalism Assistant Professor Daniel Trielli M.Jour. \u201916, who examines how search engines amplify misinformation and intentional disinformation, among other topics.\n\nWith AI technology rapidly developing, there are few controls on how it\u2019s used, they said, leaving voters responsible for separating good information from bad.\n\nWhat\u2019s your marquee example of questionable AI use in the 2024 election?\n\nGolbeck: Taylor Swift, for sure. It\u2019s astonishing to me that Donald Trump thought he could get away with posting those Swifties for Trump images. I don\u2019t think anyone thought they were real images of Taylor Swift, but that wasn\u2019t the point. Whether or not it\u2019s the reason she came out and endorsed Kamala Harris, it gave her the opportunity to say, \u2018My image was used in AI, I\u2019m concerned about this, and now I need to tell you who I\u2019m really going to vote for.\u2019\u201d\n\nResnik: The Biden robocall in New Hampshire (created by a political consultant associated with an obscure primary opponent\u2019s campaign) that was designed to suppress turnout among Biden supporters in the Democratic primary was an indicator of what the future might bring.\n\nTrielli: One of the biggest is the blatantly false charge that Haitian immigrants to Ohio were breaking a social norm by eating people\u2019s pets. The point of this was not to have a local effect and flip Ohio, but to create a general, nationwide anti-immigrant sentiment for political gain. The AI-generated images that came out of that were not portrayed as being real, but they show how disinformation campaigns often work, by creating a negative emotional vibe against someone or something.\n\nHow are most of us encountering AI-generated mis- or disinformation about the election?\n\nTrielli: The chances of encountering it, particularly in social media, are close to 100%. AI can generate emotionally appealing content with great speed, so there is a lot of it, and no matter who we are, someone we follow is going to share some of it. Beyond misinformation and disinformation, however, we are seeing a lot of generative AI content that might not be designed to make you believe something that\u2019s untruthful happened, but to cause you to make a connection between a person and an idea, positive or negative.\n\nResnik: AI has the ability to tirelessly amplify false messages on social media, and there is work in political psychology and psychology more generally showing that even false messages break through and gain acceptance if they\u2019re repeated enough and speak to people\u2019s biases enough.\n\nHowever, we don\u2019t always encounter it as a blatant, whole-cloth fabrication. My former student Pranav Goel Ph.D. \u201923 showed in his dissertation how you can take a legitimate news story and find something in it\u2014maybe an oversimplified headline\u2014that supports a narrative that may not be present in the entire piece, but can be amplified as misinformation. He showed in a very systematic way how this was happening with news sources associated with both the right wing and with progressives.\n\nGolbeck: The role of AI in this election in some ways defies predictions. A few years ago, there was an expectation of a lot of deepfakes that were really convincing and would confuse people about what\u2019s real and what isn\u2019t. At least in terms of the images and videos, there is a ton of AI-generated content, but very little of it that becomes popular is confused with reality. It\u2019s almost like a new way to create memes.\n\nIt\u2019s different on the text side. The misinformation amplification bots on social media having access to generative AI tools like ChatGPT makes them sound much more human and able to have realistic conversations. They are more convincing than they were the last election\u2014those of us who interact with bots know they can now yell at you convincingly.\n\n\n\nWho\u2019s doing it, and who their targets?\n\nGolbeck: Of course, the Russians are involved in it this year\u2014although they\u2019re not now and have never been the only state actor involved. Certainly, their bots are pushing pro-MAGA and pro-Trump content, but they\u2019re also pushing far left content to suppress votes. With some voters that means pushing Gaza war content, not to win votes for Trump, but to lose votes for the Democrats. This is the Russian, and before that, Soviet expertise in creating social division in the United States.\n\nTrielli: The strategies and the targets vary, but one thing that\u2019s important to understand is that these tactics only work because the United States election system is very fragile because of the electoral college. Sometimes one state can determine who is the next president of the United States, and maybe just a few tens of thousands of people in one part of that state. Generative AI allows for a great volume and great variety of content, and it\u2019s done with the hope that one of these messages is going to hit those few people at the right time.\n\nWhat\u2019s your biggest worry about AI-fueled deception in politics?\n\n\n\nGolbeck: There\u2019s a classic fascist political tactic where the goal isn\u2019t necessarily to get people to believe a lie, it\u2019s to make them unsure of how to discern what\u2019s true and what\u2019s not. My biggest concern is having a situation where people say, \u2018I have no idea what\u2019s real, so I\u2019m not going to trust anything.\u201d When you do that, it lays the foundation for fascist and authoritarian politics to thrive.\n\nHow can we protect ourselves from being taken in?\n\nTrielli: An important thing is understanding when we see something we generally agree with, we\u2019re more likely to accept it as true even if it isn\u2019t. As journalists, we\u2019re taught to encounter our own biases to protect against them. But with everyone on social media, we\u2019re all publishers of information now. Before you share something, you can use a technique called \u201clateral reading,\u201d where you start with piece of information and then look around for other information and context to see if that thing that you want to share is actually plausible.\n\nGolbeck: When you see something that makes you angry, you should be suspicious\u2014a lot of misinformation is designed to create this big emotional response, and it\u2019s something we\u2019re finding AI is extremely good at. It might just be something you find funny or interesting. I\u2019ve seen people from strong information backgrounds forward things they found interesting because they forgot to cross-reference.\n\nResnik: I had this experience years ago reading the Unabomber Manifesto, where it\u2019s going on about the environment and technology, and I found myself thinking, \u2018Yeah, yeah, that\u2019s a good point, very logical \u2026 wait, what!?\u2019\u201d When somebody sounds reasonable to you but is making a very unreasonable point, you have to work to separate \u201chow this makes me feel\u201d from \u201cwhat this really means.\u201d For people who are not trained to do this, I think it can be very difficult\u2014but to overcome misinformation and disinformation that targets our emotions, that\u2019s exactly what we have to do.",

        "text": "US voting systems, targets of conspiracy theories, get tested for accuracy, security\nVoting machines have been at the center of a web of conspiracy theories after the 2020 U.S. election, with false claims that they were manipulated to steal the presidency from Donald Trump.\n\nThere was no evidence of widespread fraud or rigged voting machines in the election, and multiple reviews in the battleground states where the Republican president disputed his loss to Democrat Joe Biden confirmed the results as accurate. In 2023, Fox News agreed to pay Dominion Voting Systems, one of the largest voting machine companies, $787 million to avoid a trial in a defamation lawsuit.\n\nIn the years since his loss, Trump and his allies have continued to sow doubts about voting equipment. State and local election officials have tried to push back by explaining the layers of protection that surround voting systems and the measures they have in place to conduct fair and accurate elections.\n\nIn November's presidential election, nearly every ballot cast will have a paper record that can be used to obtain an accurate count even if there are errors or cyberattacks.\n\nWhat is a voting machine?\n\nElection officials rely on various pieces of technology. Every office does things a little bit differently.\n\nOfficials rely on a voter registration system that is a database of registered voters and have an election management system that workers use to create, issue and track ballots. They also use an election-night reporting system that reports unofficial results. Many jurisdictions use electronic pollbooks to check in voters at polling locations.\n\nAll this depends on software and computers, a reliance that carries risks that officials work to identify and address. For example, election officials often will isolate critical systems from the internet and use storage devices, such as secured USB sticks, to transfer data. They limit access to sensitive equipment to only those who need it and have logs that track and monitor the devices.\n\nWhen an internet connection is needed, election officials will often use private networks to limit the risk of malicious activity and take other steps to scan their systems for potential vulnerabilities and threats.\n\nVoters in much of the country fill out ballots by hand, and then that ballot will be scanned and counted electronically. A few places, mostly small towns in the Northeast, will count their ballots by hand.\n\nIn some areas, voters use a computer to mark their ballots electronically and then get a printout of their choices that they insert into a scanner for counting. In other cases, the ballot is cast electronically, and a paper record is printed that summarizes the votes cast. That record is then available if a hand count is needed.\n\nAre voting machines connected to the internet?\n\nWith a few exceptions, no. There are some jurisdictions in a few states that allow for ballot scanners in polling locations to transmit unofficial results, using a mobile private network, after voting has ended on Election Day and the memory cards containing the vote tallies have been removed.\n\nElection officials who allow this say it provides for faster reporting of unofficial election results on election night. They say the paper records of the ballots cast are used to authenticate the results during postelection reviews, and that those records would be crucial to a recount if one was needed.\n\nComputer security experts have said this is an unnecessary risk and should be prohibited.\n\nAre voting machines secure?\n\nElection officials say they have worked extensively to shore up security around their voting equipment after an effort by Russia to scan state voter registration systems for vulnerabilities in 2016.\n\nThere was no evidence then that any data was changed or deleted, but it led the federal government to declare the nation's election systems as critical infrastructure. That allows the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency to provide free cybersecurity reviews and vulnerability testing to election offices nationwide.\n\n\"Today, eight years later, because of all the incredible work by election officials to strengthen the security and resiliency of our election process, election infrastructure has never been more secure, and the election stakeholder community has never been stronger,\" the agency's director, Jen Easterly, told reporters in September.\n\nComputer security experts have called for more to be done and for election officials to limit the use of certain technology, specifically machines that mark ballots for voters. A long-running court battle in Georgia has sought to compel the state to get rid of these machines in favor of hand-marked paper ballots.\n\nExperts have also raised particular concern about a series of security breaches that occurred after the 2020 election as Trump allies sought access to voting systems in Georgia and elsewhere as they tried to prove their unsubstantiated claims. The experts have warned that the public release of critical election software because of the breaches has raised \"serious threats\" and have called for a federal investigation.\n\nHow do election officials ensure accuracy?\n\nElection officials say there are safeguards in place to ensure that voting systems are not manipulated. That begins with physical security, such as locked rooms with limited access and the use of tamper-evident seals. In addition, voting equipment is tested before the election, a process that includes running test ballots through the equipment to ensure votes are being counted correctly.\n\nPostelection reviews are conducted to identify any mistakes or errors that may have occurred.\n\nAround 98% of all ballots cast in this year's election will include a paper record, according to a report by the Brennan Center for Justice based on data collected by Verified Voting, a nonpartisan group that tracks voting equipment in the U.S. Officials say that's important for ensuring that any error or cyberattack will not prevent officials from producing an accurate record of the vote.",

        "text": "State of the race: Five takeaways from the US election this week\nWhere do the candidates stand in the polls? We\u2019ll break it down, along with major updates from the campaign trail.\n\nWith the United States presidential election just over three weeks away, the campaigns of Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are going into overdrive, with last-minute appeals to voters.\n\nNeed a quick breakdown of the week\u2019s biggest political news? Look no further.\n\nWe\u2019ll get you up to speed with five key takeaways from the past seven days and an overview of where the candidates stand in the polls.\n\nThe election at a glance\n\nHow many days left?\n\nThere are 23 days left before the November 5 election.\n\nNational polling averages show Harris with slight lead\n\nAs of October 11, the polling aggregator FiveThirtyEight shows Vice President Kamala Harris up by 2.5 points, with 48.5 percent support compared to former President Donald Trump\u2019s 46 percent.\n\nAnother polling average, from the website 270toWin, shows Harris again with a marginal lead, with 49.3 percent support. Trump, meanwhile, is at 46.5 percent.\n\nAny surprises?\n\nHarris, the Democrat, could be poised to flip one of Trump\u2019s key demographics: suburban voters.\n\nOn October 10, the news agency Reuters and the market research poll Ipsos released a poll that showed Harris led her Republican rival 47 percent to 41 among suburbanites.\n\nBut two days later, The New York Times and Siena College released a poll that indicated Harris could be slipping among Black voters. She pulled in 78 percent support \u2014 a drop from the estimated 90 percent support her fellow Democrat, Joe Biden, earned in 2020.\n\nHurricane Milton becomes disinformation battleground\n\nWithin three days of forming in the Gulf of Mexico, Hurricane Milton had billowed into a powerful Category 5 storm, earning the highest ranking on the Saffir-Simpson scale.\n\nSuch rapid development had rarely been seen. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration dubbed Milton \u201cone of the most intense hurricanes on record in the Atlantic basin\u201d.\n\nAnd it was heading straight for Florida, the southernmost state in the contiguous United States.\n\nBut as Florida braced for impact, politicians were preparing not just for lashing wind and storm surges but also a flood of disinformation.\n\nSwaths of the US South were still recovering from September\u2019s Hurricane Helene, and in the weeks since, Trump had made a series of false claims, including that the Democrat-led federal government was \u201cgoing out of their way to not help people in Republican areas\u201d.\n\nOn the night Milton made landfall, outgoing President Joe Biden slapped back, using his White House remarks about the storm to blast Trump, his erstwhile political rival.\n\n\u201cOver the last few weeks, there\u2019s been reckless and irresponsible and relentless promotion of disinformation and outright lies about what\u2019s going on,\u201d Biden said, calling the distortions \u201cun-American\u201d.\n\n\u201cFormer President Trump has led this onslaught of lies,\u201d he added.\n\nHarris herself blasted Trump in remarks in Las Vegas. \u201cThis is not a time for people to play politics,\u201d she said, in reference to the Republican.\n\nTrump and Harris spar with mainstream media\n\nOnce criticised for failing to appear on the national media circuit, Harris zipped from one interview to the next at the start of this week, as part of a recent media blitz.\n\nIt was a stark contrast to the start of her campaign. After she announced her candidacy on July 21, Harris failed to appear in any major interview until late August.\n\nAnd even then, it was a joint interview with her running mate, Tim Walz. Her first solo interview came a couple of weeks later, on September 13, with a local TV station in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\nBut in the past week, Harris has cranked up the frequency of her media appearances. In the space of two days, she appeared on the podcast Call Her Daddy, on the radio with The Howard Stern Show and on television with talk-show appearances on The View and The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.\n\nAnd her prerecorded interview with the vaunted TV newsmagazine 60 Minutes also aired on Monday.\n\nThat last interview was meant to be part of a pair: 60 Minutes had invited Donald Trump to sit down for a recording as well.\n\nBut host Scott Pelley announced that the Trump team had pulled out of the agreed-upon interview, citing \u201cshifting explanations\u201d, including that the Republican might be fact-checked on air.\n\nThe friction between Trump and 60 Minutes did not end there. When a teaser version of the Harris interview showed the vice president answering a question differently than she did in the longer version, Trump accused the newsmagazine of trying to \u201cmake her look better\u201d.\n\nHe also called on the Federal Communications Commission to \u201cTAKE AWAY THE CBS LICENSE\u201d. The remarks earned a rebuke from the commission\u2019s chair, who warned that such an action would threaten free speech.\n\nHarris touts health as advantage over Trump\n\nThrough much of the 2024 election, questions of health and competency have loomed large \u2014 even dooming one candidate\u2019s run.\n\nAfter a dismal debate performance in June, the 81-year-old Biden was forced out of the presidential race amid questions about his age and ability to lead. It was the culmination of months of speculation and attacks, as Trump dug into Biden as a \u201cweak\u201d and \u201csleepy\u201d old man.\n\nBut at 78 years old, Trump himself has faced questions about his age and mental competency.\n\nThose questions came back into the spotlight this week. Last Sunday, The New York Times ran a story analysing Trump\u2019s \u201crambling\u201d and increasingly longwinded speeches, questioning whether his speech patterns reflected the toll of age.\n\nAnd then, on Saturday, the White House released a memo touting his Democratic rival\u2019s health.\n\nThe 59-year-old Harris, it read, \u201cpossesses the physical and mental resiliency required to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency\u201d.\n\nTrump has long touted his performance on cognitive tests as evidence of his abilities. On Saturday, his campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung responded to the media scrutiny with a statement, arguing that Harris \u201cdoes not have the stamina\u201d of Trump.\n\n\u201cAll have concluded he is in perfect and excellent health to be Commander in Chief,\u201d Cheung wrote of Trump.\n\nTrump lays out blueprint for anti-immigrant agenda\n\nOn the campaign trail this week, Trump ratcheted up his attacks on migrants in the US, continuing a streak of false and incendiary claims.\n\nImmigration has been one of the defining issues of Trump\u2019s political career, and he has gone to great lengths to project a hardline image.\n\nBut critics warn his nativist rhetoric has grown increasingly extreme, echoing the sentiments of white supremacists and other controversial figures.\n\nOn Monday, Trump recorded an audio interview with the Hugh Hewitt Show, where he repeated false claims that murderers were crossing the border into the US en masse.\n\n\u201cMany of them murdered far more than one person, and they\u2019re now happily living in the United States,\u201d Trump said. \u201cNow a murderer, I believe this: It\u2019s in their genes. And we\u2019ve got a lot of bad genes in our country right now.\u201d\n\nThe Republican continued to play up the spectre of immigrants as criminals in appearances throughout the week, most notably on Friday.\n\nSpeaking in Aurora, Colorado, Trump pledged that, if re-elected, he would use his first days in office to \u201cexpedite the removal\u201d of \u201csavage gangs\u201d from abroad, as well as invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a wartime law, as a tool for mass deportation.\n\nHe also called for the death penalty for migrants who killed US citizens.\n\nDespite Trump\u2019s portrayals of lawlessness, studies have shown that undocumented immigrants commit crimes at far lower rates than US-born citizens.\n\nBob Woodward\u2019s book paints unflattering portrait\n\nReporter Bob Woodward holds near-mythic status in the US journalism sphere.\n\nIn 1972, he and his Washington Post colleague Carl Bernstein helped reveal President Richard Nixon\u2019s role in the Watergate scandal, thereby precipitating the politician\u2019s eventual resignation.\n\nSince then, Woodward has published dozens of books, purporting to show the inner machinations of US politics. His latest, landing right in the midst of the heated presidential race, offered an unflattering glimpse of Trump\u2019s alleged relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nEntitled War, the book was released to news outlets on Tuesday in advance of landing on bookstore shelves.\n\nIn its pages, an unnamed aide alleged Trump called Putin at least seven times since leaving office. The book also claimed that, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Trump sent virus-testing machines that were in short supply to Putin.\n\nNews outlets have since struggled to independently verify some of the book\u2019s most headline-grabbing claims. And Trump\u2019s team refuted them entirely, calling Woodward an \u201cangry, little man\u201d.\n\n\u201cNone of these made up stories by Bob Woodward are true and are the work of a truly demented and deranged man,\u201d Cheung, Trump\u2019s spokesperson, wrote in a statement.\n\nBut the book does contain some high-profile named sources, including the former head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mark Milley \u2014 once the highest-ranking military officer in the US.\n\nHe tells Woodward in the book that Trump is \u201cfascist to the core\u201d.",

        "text": "2024 US presidential election: can we believe the polls?\nNationwide polls are often of limited relevance, considering the unique structure of the US electoral system. To gain a better understanding of the upcoming presidential election, we need to focus on surveys conducted in the pivotal battlegrounds \u2013 the so-called swing states. After the missteps in previous elections, it\u2019s hard to place too much confidence in these polls, as many rely on unrepresentative samples.\n\nAs we head toward the 2024 US presidential election, media large and small frequently fall into the trap of \u201chorse race\u201d journalism. Policy questions are rarely treated in depth, and the emphasis is often on the latest polls. One week they announce Kamala Harris as moving ahead, and the next, Donald Trump still has an edge. But how reliable are these polls?\n\nIn the United States, rather than being elected by direct popular vote, the president is chosen indirectly through the Electoral College, an institution inscribed in the country\u2019s constitution. Each state is assigned a number of electors based in part on its population, but also on its number of senators. As a result, smaller states get a larger voice than their population would indicate.\n\nOne of the implications is that national election polls can be deceiving. In most states with established partisan majorities, the outcomes are predictable due to the winner-takes-all approach. This system awards all of a state\u2019s electoral votes to the candidate who wins the popular vote in that state (with the exception of Maine and Nebraska, which use a proportional system). As a result, the most relevant polls are those conducted in \u201cswing states\u201d, where neither party holds a consistent advantage.\n\nAccording to recent analyses, around ten states are expected to be in play for 2024. Based on recent trends, there are seven swing states to watch: Nevada, Arizona, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Georgia. In the 2016 and 2020 elections, victory margins in these states were razor-thin, often less than 1%.\n\nWith both Harris and Trump within striking distance of the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the presidency, these swing states, with a combined 91 votes, will determine the outcome.\n\nThe 2016 and 2020 polling failures: flukes or systemic issues?\n\nWhen the margins are so tight in these key states, accurately measuring voter intentions is an enormous challenge. In 2016, national polls correctly predicted Hillary Clinton\u2019s popular-vote win \u2013 she had nearly 3 million more than Trump. However, they failed to foresee Trump\u2019s Electorial College victories in critical states, which ultimately put him over the top.\n\nThe American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) pointed out several reasons for these errors, including underrepresentation of Republican voters, over-representation of college-educated voters (who tend to lean Democratic), and an underestimation of undecided voters who eventually voted for Trump or third-party candidates.\n\nDespite efforts to fix these problems, other biases showed up in 2020. While graduate voters were not over-represented and undecideds were evenly split between Biden and Trump, the Covid-19 pandemic had made the pollsters\u2019 task more complicated. AAPOR points out that the states with a higher proportion of Covid-19 cases were the ones with the highest polling errors. As a result, pollsters underestimated Trump\u2019s vote share in key swing states and also overestimated Biden\u2019s national lead, making the 2020 polls the least accurate in 40 years.\n\nPew Reseach Center\n\nDespite these errors, Biden still triumphed, winning 4 percent more of the popular vote and taking home 306 electoral votes to Trump\u2019s 232. Biden\u2019s victories in the swing states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin make all the difference.\n\nPolling errors and public distrust\n\nErrors of this magnitude naturally increase the public\u2019s scepticism of polling, especially among Republicans, who are already wary of establishment institutions. Contrary to initial assumptions, Trump voters didn\u2019t hesitate to express their preferences in 2016 and 2020. However, they were less likely to participate in polls due in part to their distrust of mainstream institutions. As a result, working-class white voters \u2013 and their opinions \u2013 were underrepresented in many polls.\n\nPollsters also face technical challenges. Getting a respondent on the phone now requires calling hundreds of people, thanks to caller ID and call screening. Polls with smaller samples (fewer than 1,000 respondents) are less reliable. To deal with these hurdles, many pollsters are now using a mix of methods, including e-mail, online surveys, and robocalls.\n\nThough cheaper, online surveys often draw voluntary participants who are compensated, which leads to issues of accuracy and representation. This growing reliance on online polling has contributed to a doubling of polling companies from 2000 to 2022, according to Pew Research Center.\n\nMargin of error and identifying \u201clikely\u201d voters\n\nThe margin of error is a critical component of polling that is often misunderstood by the public and media. It typically falls between 3 and 4 percentage points, but for smaller demographic groups (for example, young people, white men, or Hispanics), it can be even higher. Media headlines, however, frequently imply a candidate is leading, even when the difference is within the margin of error. University of California, Berkeley researchers suggest that to ensure 95% accuracy, the margin of error should be closer to 6%.\n\nHowever, the media sometimes amplify results, particularly in headlines, by implying that a candidate is ahead, even when the difference is within the margin of error. Moreover, researchers at the University of Berkeley have shown that to guarantee 95% accuracy, this margin should be increased to at least 6%. This means a candidate projected to receive 54% of the vote is likely, in reality, to secure anywhere between 48% and 60%, reflecting an actual margin of error of 12 percentage points.\n\nAnother significant challenge for pollsters is identifying likely voters. Only around two-thirds of citizens eligible to vote actually go to the polls. In 2016, turnout on the Democratic side was overestimated, giving the false impression that Clinton was a lock for victory. This likely caused some of her supporters to stay home, while Trump\u2019s base showed up in force when polls suggested he was behind. Accurately predicting who will turn out to vote is crucial to polling accuracy.\n\nLessons from the 2022 midterms: A glimmer of hope for 2024?\n\nPolling showed notable improvements during the 2022 midterm elections, with the results being the most accurate since 1998. Importantly, there was no significant bias toward either party. However, midterm elections operate differently than presidential elections, and the dynamics for 2024 may be very different. That said, many polling institutions have adapted since 2016: as of 2022, 61% of polling firms had changed their methods, such as refining sampling techniques and improving question wording. More than a third have changed their methods after 2020.\n\nWhile these changes are positive, challenges remain, especially in predicting turnout and combating low response rates.\n\nWhat good are polls, then?\n\nAt the end of the day, election polls offer snapshots \u2013 often imprecise \u2013 and can only provide general trends. Polling methods vary across firms, introducing biases that make it difficult to compare results.\n\nSurvey aggregators offer averages that might be more reliable than individual polls, but they still come with a degree of uncertainty. This is true for FiveThirtyEight, the well-known website founded by statistics guru Nate Silver. After ABC took over in 2023, Silver left, taking his forecasting model with him to his new platform, Silver Bulletin, which continues to attract significant media attention.\n\nWith the unpredictability of polls, political betting markets have become popular as polling alternatives. Platforms like Polymarket, which recently hired Silver, have multiplied rapidly. Some people, like Elon Musk, argue that markets provide better forecasts than traditional polls, though this claim is unproven. There are also concerns that these markets could be manipulated to sway public opinion.\n\nWhile opinion polls aren\u2019t the best tools for predicting elections \u2013 as this could be one of the closest in recent history \u2013 their value lies in gauging public opinion on key issues. However, even in this role, polls can still be biased, often influenced by how questions are phrased.\n\nFor example, in 2019 USA Today ran the headline \u201cPoll: Half of Americans say Trump is victim of a \u2018witch hunt\u2019 as trust in Mueller erodes\u201d. This was in reference to Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The question asked by the poll was:\n\n\u201cPresident Trump has called the special counsel\u2019s investigation a \u2018witch hunt\u2019 and said he has been investigated more than previous presidents for political reasons. Do you agree?\u201d\n\nThe problem with this wording is that it combined two different ideas: whether the investigation was a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and whether Trump had been unfairly targeted for political reasons. On top of that, the question lacked neutrality, presenting only his perspective.\n\nNaturally, Trump used the result to his advantage, even though other polls from sources such as The Washington Post, CBS News, and NPR-PBS told a different story.\n\nTo use polling data wisely during this election, it\u2019s crucial to recognize these limitations and pay attention to the fine print \u2013 details like the sample size, polling date, margin of error, and methodology. Additionally, consider the poll\u2019s sponsors, who may only release results that align with their particular agenda.\n\nUltimately, the best way to interpret polling data is with caution, focusing on general trends rather than any single poll. And always remember, election outcomes can be full of surprises.",

        "text": "Supreme Court signals how the next president could impact abortion access \u2014 no legislation needed \u2022 Louisiana Illuminator\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s rejection last week of the Biden administration\u2019s appeal to weigh in on a dispute over emergency abortion care in Texas foreshadows how the next president could protect or restrict abortion access without signing \u2014 or vetoing \u2014 federal legislation.\n\nThe court\u2019s decision came Monday as early voting was already underway in some states in the first presidential election since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, ending federal abortion protections and sending the issue back to the states.\n\nTexas is one of 13 states that currently have total abortion bans in place and another four states cap the procedure after six weeks, before many people know they are pregnant.\n\nThis report was originally published by The 19th . The Illuminator is a founding member of The 19th News Network.\n\nRestoring Roe\u2019s protections nationwide are central to the case that Democratic nominee Kamala Harris is making against Republican nominee Donald Trump. Headed into the final weeks of the race, polls show abortion gaining on the economy as the top-of-mind issue for voters, particularly in battleground states and for women under 45 years old.\n\nTrump, who as president cemented the conservative bloc on the court that overturned Roe in the case Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, has provided few details about how his administration would approach abortion, saying only that he feels it is an issue best left up to the states and that \u201ceveryone knows\u201d he would not sign a federal abortion ban.\n\nTrump has yet to comment on the myriad of other ways a president\u2019s administration can impact abortion access via the federal agency rulemaking process or by prosecuting state bans when they conflict with federal laws, such as in the Texas dispute.\n\nIn the Texas case, the Biden administration is arguing that a 1986 law known as EMTALA, which requires most hospitals to provide emergency care, applies to abortion even in states with bans \u2014 Texas disagrees. The state\u2019s abortion ban has limited exceptions for patients who have a life-threatening condition or who are at risk of \u201csubstantial impairment of a major bodily function\u201d but what constitutes substantial impairment is left undefined.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s decision to not hear an appeal at this juncture means that as the case continues, a lower court order will remain in place that says hospitals cannot be required to provide emergency abortions in cases when they might violate Texas\u2019 ban. Legal experts told The 19th that the order could also affect cases in Louisiana and Mississippi, which are also under the jurisdiction of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\n\u201cLet me be clear: Donald Trump is the architect of this health care crisis,\u201d Vice President Harris wrote on the social media site X shortly after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision not to take the case. \u201cI will never stop fighting for a woman\u2019s right to emergency medical care \u2014 and to restore the protections of Roe v. Wade so that women in every state have access to the care they need.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign did not respond to multiple requests for comment on the Texas case or to provide further information about how his administration would interpret EMTALA as it relates to the state abortion bans that have proliferated since the Dobbs ruling.\n\nShortly after the Dobbs decision, President Joe Biden\u2019s Department of Health and Human Services issued guidance stating that states with abortion bans could not enforce the parts that conflicted with EMTALA. The administration sued Idaho and the Supreme Court dismissed an appeal from Idaho officials in that case earlier this year, delivering a temporary victory to abortion-rights supporters. Texas challenged the EMTALA guidance and a federal trial and appeals court sided in the state\u2019s favor. The Biden administration appealed to the Supreme Court, pointing to the Idaho case, which paved the way for emergency abortions to continue in that state, at least temporarily.\n\nThe Biden administration\u2019s role in interpreting EMTALA, defending its interpretation in the Texas case, and suing Idaho over its abortion ban shows how a president can impact abortion access in ways that are far more nuanced than signing or vetoing legislation. Discussion of a federal abortion ban or national bill with Roe\u2019s protections have dominated the presidential race \u2014 the reality is that neither party will likely have the numbers in Congress to enact abortion legislation.\n\nTrump\u2019s Republican Party has long aligned with the anti-abortion movement and the former president still touts the role he played nominating the justices who decided Dobbs. The anti-abortion coalition working to elect Trump \u2014 and his stated preference to leave the issue up to the states \u2014 would likely inform about how his administration handles abortion-related rulemaking and legal challenges. Trump has not said whether his Justice Department would continue to defend the Biden administration\u2019s EMTALA interpretation; he also has not said whether his Department of Health and Human Services would agree with that interpretation or rescind it.\n\nTrump and his running mate, Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio, have not released policies related to reproductive health care. Though they have both tried to distance themselves from a far-right Christian vision for a second Trump term known as Project 2025, crafted by the conservative Heritage Foundation, it provides the most detailed picture about how their administration might approach the issue of abortion across the White House and various federal agencies.\n\nAt least 140 people who worked in Trump\u2019s first administration helped craft the 920-page Project 2025. Among other anti-abortion provisions, it urges a Trump-Vance Department of Health and Human Services to rebrand itself as the \u201cDepartment of Life\u201d and to rescind the Biden administration\u2019s EMTALA guidance. It also encourages the Trump Justice Department to announce a campaign to enforce the long-dormant 1873 Comstock Act, which prohibits the mailing of obscene materials and articles intended for \u201cproducing abortion.\u201d These provisions, if implemented, would have nationwide impacts on abortion access.\n\n\u201cTo the credit of the authors of Project 2025, they thought through all of these implications of a change in administrations,\u201d said David Cohen, an abortion law expert at Drexel University.\n\nCohen predicted that if Trump wins in November, his Department of Health and Human Services would \u201cimmediately\u201d rescind the Biden administration\u2019s interpretation of EMTALA as it relates to abortion bans. That, in turn, would make the Idaho case \u201cdisappear\u201d and the Texas case would be dismissed, he said. The practical impact would be that EMTALA would not protect access to emergency abortions in states with bans unless private parties brought different lawsuits \u2014 an unpredictable process that could take years.\n\n\u201cThis is just another aspect in which the two administrations would vary drastically,\u201d he added.\n\nYOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.

        "text": "From key states to abortion: Here's what you need to know about 2024 US presidential election\nThe 2024 U.S. presidential election is unlike any other before it. The Republican candidate, former President Donald Trump, was convicted of a crime and faced two assassination attempts. The Democratic candidate, Vice President Kamala Harris, rose to the top of the ticket after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race in July. With just over three weeks until the Nov. 5 election, opinion polls show a tight race, including in the seven battleground states that will decide the contest. This combination of photos shows Vice President Kamala Harris, left, on Aug. 7, 2024, and Republican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump on July 31, 2024. (AP)\n\nHarris' candidacy re-energized the Democratic Party, sparking a surge in fundraising and enthusiasm from groups such as young voters, women and voters of color that Biden lacked. If elected, Harris, the daughter of a Jamaican father and a South Asian mother, would be the first woman and second person of color to serve as U.S. president. Harris, 59, is widely seen to have bested Trump, 78, in their combative Sept. 10 debate, putting him on the defensive with a stream of attacks about his fitness for office and myriad legal woes. But some likely voters say they still want to hear more about her policies and what her presidency would look like. Trump, who served as president from 2017-2021, continues to have an advantage on the economy, a top voter concern. He also has maintained support among voters who prioritize a secure U.S. border with Mexico. Trump survived an attempt on his life during a July 13 rally in Pennsylvania, when a gunman's bullet grazed his ear. He was targeted a second time by an alleged assassin in September while playing golf on his private Florida course. The gunman was apprehended before any shots were fired. In May, Trump became the first former president to be convicted of a crime when he was found guilty on 34 felony counts relating to a scheme to cover up an alleged affair with a porn star. He is due to be sentenced after the election.\n\nBoth candidates tapped relative political unknowns as their vice presidential running mates, with Harris selecting Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, a former member of Congress, and Trump choosing first-term U.S. Senator JD Vance of Ohio.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr., 70, a scion of the prominent political family, had been running as an independent candidate, but he left the race in August and endorsed Trump.\n\nBiden, 81, decided not to run for reelection after a faltering debate performance against Trump in June sparked concerns about his mental acuity and resulted in calls from party leaders and donors to exit the race. Trump has refused to say he would abide by this year's election results, and he continues to falsely claim that Biden's victory over him in the 2020 election was fraudulent. His allies are laying the groundwork for a significant poll-watching effort and potential post-election legal challenges.\n\nWHAT IS HARRIS\u2019 MAIN ELECTORAL ARGUMENT?\n\nSince becoming the Democratic candidate, Harris has tried to draw sharp contrasts with Trump, positioning herself as a next-generation leader with an eye toward the future while casting him as an agent of \u201cchaos.\u201d\n\nHarris has been able to draw a contrast as well with Biden, whom voters also viewed as someone who may have grown too old for the job. On policy, however, she has largely stuck with Biden on issues such as the economy, the Gaza conflict, immigration and abortion rights.\n\nHarris has put forth proposals that would cut taxes for a large swath of voters and pledged new investments in child care and healthcare. Polls show she has gained some ground on Trump on the economy. However, inflation continues to be a sticking point after peaking in 2022. While the inflation rate has since eased, voters remain concerned about high prices for food and housing.\n\nHarris has pointed to federal investments in infrastructure, clean energy and chip manufacturing that she says will generate long-term job growth.\n\nWHAT IS TRUMP\u2019S MAIN ELECTORAL ARGUMENT?\n\nTrump and his campaign contend Americans were better off economically during his time in the White House, pointing to inflation and high interest rates under Biden and Harris\u2019 watch. Trump has made tariffs and tax cuts the key elements of his economic pitch to voters. He has said he would cut federal spending, which Republicans blame for stoking inflation and triggering consumer price spikes, and trim back federal regulations.\n\nTrump also has said he would revive stricter immigration policies from his time in office to stem the record flow of migrants into the U.S. from Mexico, and would conduct mass deportations. Trump has claimed, without providing evidence, that the influx of migrants has led to a rise in violent crime. Studies show immigrants are less likely to engage in criminality than native-born Americans.\n\nAs a rebuttal to charges that he is a danger to democracy, Trump has accused the Biden White House of weaponizing the Justice Department in order to prosecute him and prevent him from winning another term. The Justice Department says it acts without political bias. On foreign policy, Trump embraces what he calls an \"America First\" agenda that seeks to avoid international entanglements. He has pledged to keep the country out of \"forever wars\" and claims he could end the Ukraine-Russia conflict within 24 hours.\n\nWHERE DO HARRIS AND TRUMP STAND ON ABORTION?\n\nDemocrats have made abortion rights central to their 2024 campaign, two years after the Supreme Court \u2013 powered by a conservative majority that Trump installed \u2013 overturned the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision and ruled that abortion was not constitutionally protected.\n\nOpinion polls show most Americans do not favor strict limits on reproductive rights, and Democrats are hoping threats to those rights will encourage millions of women and independents to vote their way this year. Harris has argued for federal legislation that would restore the constitutional right to abortion.\n\nTrump has said the matter should be left to individual states and that he does not support a national ban on the procedure. He supports exceptions for rape, incest and to protect the life of the mother.\n\nAt the June debate with Biden, Trump said he would \"not block\" access to abortion medication as president despite moves by some Republican-led states to restrict the use of the drugs.\n\nBORDER SECURITY\n\nSince 2021, the Biden administration has grappled with record numbers of migrants caught illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. Harris was sent by Biden to serve as a liaison between the U.S. and Central American nations that served as origin points for migration to the border. Republicans have attempted to cast her as a \u201cborder czar,\u201d but she was never tasked with overseeing border-security efforts.\n\nIn June, as polls showed immigration to be a top issue for the election, Biden implemented a new series of restrictive security measures that permit the government to quickly deport or turn back migrants who enter the country illegally without allowing them to claim asylum. The measures bore resemblance to Trump-era border policies, prompting criticism from liberals. But they have resulted in dramatically fewer border crossings.\n\nIn February, Trump urged congressional Republicans to back away from a bipartisan bill that gave his party many of the border-related measures it sought in order to avoid giving Biden a policy victory.\n\nTHE ISRAEL-HAMAS CONFLICT\n\nBiden \u2013 and now Harris \u2013 have been heavily criticized by many Democrats for the administration\u2019s steadfast support of Israel in its yearlong conflict with Hamas in Gaza.\n\nThe Biden administration has called for the Israeli government to temper its assault on Gaza, where more than 42,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to health officials in the enclave. However, at the same time the Biden administration continues to supply Israel with military munitions. Harris backs efforts to reach a ceasefire deal that would end the hostilities in exchange for a return of hostages taken on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas militants invaded southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people, according to Israeli figures . But those efforts have been complicated by the expansion of the conflict into Lebanon.\n\nTrump and Republicans also back Israel and have accused pro-Palestinian protesters of being antisemitic. But Trump has urged Israel to \"finish up\" the war or risk losing global support.\n\nWHERE DO BIDEN AND TRUMP STAND ON CHINA?\n\nThe Biden administration has said it wants to \"de-risk\" and not \"de-couple\" its relationship with China and work to keep the competition between the world's No. 1 and No. 2 economic powers from escalating into conflict. Even so, the White House in September imposed more tariffs on Chinese goods such as steel and aluminum products and EV batteries.\n\nBiden has sworn to protect Taiwan from any Chinese attack.\n\nTrump favors a policy of strategic ambiguity to deliberately create uncertainty about how the U.S. would act if there was a Chinese invasion of the democratically governed island.\n\nWhile some Republicans view China as a rising national security threat, Trump largely has characterized the Asian giant as an economic rival and has vowed to impose further tariffs on Chinese imports.\n\nWHERE DO THEY STAND ON UKRAINE?\n\nBiden and Harris have been a fierce advocate of providing weapons and other assistance to Ukraine in its war with Russia, while Trump has repeatedly expressed doubts about whether such aid is in the U.S. national interest.\n\nTrump in April declined to lobby against passage of a $95 billion bipartisan aid package for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan spearheaded by Republican House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson, even as it was opposed by Trump's allies in Congress.\n\nBut at the September debate with Harris, Trump declined to say whether Ukraine should win the war and has since suggested it should have capitulated to Russia to prevent the invasion.\n\nIn February, Trump made waves when he suggested the U.S. should not defend NATO countries that do not meet their obligations to contribute to their national defense.\n\nWHAT ARE THE KEY STATES IN THE 2024 ELECTION?\n\nBecause many states vote dependably for Democrats or Republicans in presidential elections, the outcome usually rests on a handful of states where the election is truly competitive.\n\nPolls show Trump and Harris are neck and neck in the seven swing states: Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina.\n\nWith 19 electoral votes, Pennsylvania is the biggest prize among the battleground states that will decide the election.",

        "text": "Betting soars after court ruling allows gambling on US presidential election\nBetting soars after court ruling allows gambling on US presidential election\n\nAFP, WASHINGTON\n\n\n\n\n\nMillions of dollars have poured into bets on who will win the US presidential election after a last-minute court ruling opened up gambling on the vote, upping the stakes on a too-close-to-call race between US Vice President Kamala Harris and former US president Donald Trump that has already put voters on edge.\n\nContracts for a Harris victory were trading between 48 and 50 percent in favor of the Democrat on Friday on Interactive Brokers, a firm that has taken advantage of a legal opening created earlier this month in the country\u2019s long running regulatory battle over election markets.\n\nWith just a month until the Nov. 5 vote, markets opened after a court in Washington ruled that Kalshi, a start-up that has been trying to introduce political betting in the US for years, could take wagers as legal appeals by regulators against the company continue. Within days, more than US$6.3 million had been put on the line for the Harris-Trump matchup alone, with users also betting on control of the US House of Representatives and US Senate.\n\nSupporters of former US president and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump wear campaign-themed socks as they line up outside a convention center to see Trump in Aurora, Colorado, on Friday. Photo: AFP\n\nIt is the latest turn in a years-long saga between the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and firms wishing to offer election betting \u2014 a legal practice in a number of other countries and one that some Americans participate in outside of regulators\u2019 oversight through offshore markets.\n\nMore than US$1.7 billion has been placed on the Harris-Trump matchup on one such offshore site, Polymarket, where Trump held a 54 to 45 advantage over Harris on Friday evening.\n\nThose in favor of gambling \u2014 or \u201cevent contracts\u201d in finance terms \u2014 say it is a legitimate way to hedge bets against adverse outcomes, likening it to futures contracts. Some also say that the markets are better than polls.\n\n\u201cThese contracts are important,\u201d said Steve Sanders, executive vice president of marketing and product development at Interactive Brokers. \u201cThey\u2019re good for people to take a view on what they think is happening and hedge their portfolios.\u201d\n\nIn just days, more than 1 million contracts had been traded on Interactive Brokers.\n\nOnly two election betting markets were legally operating in the US before the ruling on Wednesday last week, having been granted exemptions due to their affiliation with research projects and the strict limits they placed on the amount people could bet.\n\nCritics worry about widespread election gambling in a polarized moment when basic facts are in dispute and disinformation on which people might base their wagers is abundant.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be too dramatic, but we live in a country where tens of millions of Americans believe the last presidential election was stolen,\u201d CFTC General Counsel Rob Schwartz said during recent arguments against Kalshi.\n\n\u201cEnsuring the integrity of elections and avoiding improper interference and misinformation are undoubtedly paramount public interests,\u201d Judge Patricia Millett wrote in the decision that allowed bets to be placed while the appeals against Kalshi play out.\n\nHowever, the CFTC had \u201cgiven this court no concrete basis to conclude that event contracts would likely be a vehicle for such harms,\u201d she added.\n\nWhile the door on political betting might shut again on further appeal, any decision on that would likely come after Nov. 5, meaning markets would stay open through the election.\n\nFor Pratik Chougule, cofounder of the advocacy group Coalition for Political Forecasting, \u201cit\u2019s been a good year\u201d so far for his own political wagers.\n\nHe said he is taking a look at opening an account with Interactive Brokers now that it is operating election contracts.\n\nJudges on further appeals might be \u201ca bit more skeptical,\u201d but Chougule said that in the past few years the CFTC has warmed up to at least understanding the arguments in favor election markets, even if regulators do not endorse them.",

        "summary": " New ABC News/Ipsos poll: Kamala Harris leads Donald Trump by 2 percentage points in 2024 presidential race .

        "text": "Economic discontent, issue divisions add up to tight presidential contest: POLL\nDreary economic attitudes and sharply divergent views on social policies mark the 2024 presidential election, contributing to a tighter contest between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump: Just 2 percentage points now divide them in a new ABC News/Ipsos poll.\n\nHarris has 50% support to Trump's 48% among likely voters in the national survey, with a similar 49-47% result among all registered voters. (Among all adults, regardless of registration status, it's a single-point race, 49-48%, excluding those who wouldn't vote.)\n\nRepublican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump, left, and Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris during an ABC News presidential debate at the National Constitution Center, Sept. 10, 2024, in Philadelphia. Alex Brandon/AP, FILE\n\nThe results are slightly closer than Harris' +5 points among likely voters and the general public, and +4 among registered voters, in the last ABC/Ipsos poll in mid-September. A gain for Trump among men -- he's now +8 points among those registered to vote -- is a factor, as is a slip for Harris among independents, often swing voters.\n\nEconomy and Vote Preference ABC News, Ipsos poll\n\nSee PDF for full results.\n\nBeneath the horse race, issues pull in opposite directions. The poll, produced for ABC News by Langer Research Associates, with fieldwork by Ipsos, finds that 56% of Americans now favor deporting all undocumented immigrants, up 20 points from eight years ago. That reinforces one of Trump's strongest issues, with a 10-point Trump lead in trust to handle immigration at the southern border.\n\nDeportation and Abortion: Divergent Views ABC News, Ipsos poll\n\nYet the same share, 56%, side with Harris on abortion, saying the federal government should restore access to what it was before the Supreme Court eliminated the constitutional right to abortion in 2022. Many fewer, 41%, favor Trump's view that each state should decide. It follows that abortion is Harris' best issue in this poll, with a 15-point lead over Trump in trust on it.\n\nThe economy/the future\n\nThen there's the economy, and related to it, a sharp division on the nation's future. As reported Friday, 44% of Americans say they're not as well off now as they were when Biden took office, tying the most negative number on this question in data since 1986.\n\nFurther, while inflation has eased and employment is strong, those gains haven't hit home for most people: 59% say the economy is getting worse, more than twice as many as say it's getting better, 23%. And among registered voters who say the economy's worsening, Trump leads Harris by a sweeping 53 points, 74-21%.\n\nOptimism and Vote Preference. Among registered voters ABC News, Ipsos poll\n\nLargely informed by economic attitudes, registered voters divide, 51-47%, on whether America's best days are still ahead, or behind it. This in turn relates to candidate choice: Trump, with his message of national decay, leads Harris by 27 points, 61-34%, among those who say the country's best days are behind it. Harris, with her more optimistic messaging, leads Trump by 28 points, 63-35%, among those who think America's best days are ahead.\n\nTaken another way, 59% of Trump's supporters say the country's best days are behind it. Among Harris supporters, 67% say the country's best days are still to come.\n\nEconomy/issues\n\nTrump leads Harris by 8 points overall in trust to handle the economy and 7 points on inflation, consistent results since August that are central to his competitiveness and reflect Harris' challenges breaking free from dissatisfaction with Biden's economic stewardship. (See more on this in Friday's report on Harris' headwinds as an agent of change.)\n\nThat said, Harris pushes back on another economic benchmark, \"looking out for the middle class.\" A new item in this poll, she leads Trump on it by 5 points, 42-37%. (The rest don't trust either of them to handle it.)\n\nTrust on Economic Issues ABC News, Ipsos poll\n\nA test of three economic proposals from each candidate fills out the story: Trump has both the most popular and the least popular proposals, with Harris winning the second, third and fourth slots of the six.\n\nSpecifically, Trump's suggestion to end income taxes on Social Security benefits leads in popularity, followed by three from Harris -- a tax credit for middle- and lower-income families with newborns, a limit on the profits food companies can make on groceries and grants to first-time home buyers. Two more Trump proposals come next -- raising tariffs on foreign imports, and the one that is unpopular among most people, cutting corporate income taxes.\n\nRepublican presidential nominee and former President Donald Trump addresses the Detroit Economic Club in Detroit., Oct. 10, 2024. Rebecca Cook/Reuters, FILE\n\nOne of these -- the idea to end taxes on Social Security benefits -- rises to the level of majority \"strong\" support, 55%. Harris' three proposals also get more strong support than strong opposition, by 10 to 23 points. Trump's remaining items, by contrast, get much less strong support -- and cutting corporate income taxes is more apt to be strongly opposed.\n\nViews on the Candidates\u2019 Economic Proposals ABC News, Ipsos poll\n\nIn trust on other issues, Trump holds single-digit leads on handling crime and safety, national security and the conflict in the Middle East; Harris has a single-digit lead on \"protecting American democracy.\" Results for items repeated from past polls are virtually unchanged.\n\nEnthusiasm and attributes\n\nWhile potential voters are closely divided on many points, enthusiasm and personal favorability are two areas in which Harris has clear advantages. Among registered voters who support her, 84% say they're enthusiastic about it; among Trump supporters, enthusiasm drops by 6 points, to 78%. That's markedly lower than enthusiasm for Trump -- 93% -- at this point in 2020.\n\nDemocratic presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris speaks during a campaign rally at the Rawhide Event Center, Oct. 10, 2024, in Chandler, Ariz. Brandon Bell/Getty Images\n\nEnthusiasm is related to personal favorability, and 44% of Americans see Harris favorably, vs. 35% for Trump. Harris' favorability rating lost 3 points in this poll, and 47% now see her unfavorably. That said, many more, 58%, have an unfavorable opinion of Trump.\n\nFavorability isn't determinative. Trump has been underwater in favorability consistently since 2015 -- but won the Electoral College eight years ago regardless.\n\nOne important boost to Trump is that, among the 15% of registered voters who see both candidates unfavorably, he leads by a wide margin, 62-24%. Looking at it another way, 21% of Trump's supporters see him unfavorably, but support him anyway. The corresponding figure for Harris is just 7%.\n\nTrump also continues to score a few points by portraying Harris as too liberal. Forty-eight percent of Americans see her this way, vs. 43% who call Trump too conservative. That said, 7% call Harris too conservative and 9% call Trump too liberal; at the end of the day, very similar numbers call them \"about right\" ideologically, 43% for Trump, 41% for Harris.\n\nDebate?\n\nHowever much they're liked or disliked, another result shows that most people are ready to hear more from the candidates: 57% say Harris and Trump should agree to an additional televised debate, while 41% say not.\n\nTrump reiterated last week that another debate is not in the cards. And there's a difference on the question between their supporters. Among registered voters who prefer Harris, 71% are looking for another debate, while among those who prefer Trump, this drops sharply, to 45%. (After their sole debate last month, 58% overall thought Harris had won it.)\n\nPartisans\n\nWith the election close to three weeks away, partisanship infuses survey results. Eighty-five percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents say the economy is getting worse, for instance, while just 32% of Democrats and Democratic leaners agree. In another example, Republicans and GOP leaners are far more apt than their Democratic counterparts to say the country's best days have passed, 60% vs. 36%.\n\nPolicy preferences show similar patterns. Eighty-eight percent of Republicans support mass deportation, as do 58% of independents, compared with 26% of Democrats. (That said, support for deportations has increased broadly compared with a 2016 survey, with the exception of views among Democrats and liberals.)\n\nOn abortion, partisan divisions results are reversed: Eighty-seven percent of Democrats say the federal government should restore abortion access, as do 57% of independents, dropping to 27% of Republicans.\n\nPartisanship and the Issues ABC News, Ipsos poll\n\nVote preferences\n\nPolls are best used not to recite who's ahead, but to assess how and why the country is coming to its decision. It's also important to keep in mind that the ultimate winner of the popular vote may differ from the winner of the presidency, as demonstrated in 2016 and 2000 (and likewise, for history buffs, in 1888, 1876 and 1824).\n\nWith Election Day drawing close and early voting underway, this poll includes slight departures from previous ABC/Ipsos polls this cycle in measuring vote preferences. Survey respondents are offered up to five candidates -- Harris, Trump, Jill Stein, Chase Oliver and Cornel West, and their running mates -- based on which of those candidates are on the ballot in the state where the respondent lives. (Robert F. Kennedy Jr., while on the ballot in 30 states and the District of Columbia, is not listed, since he's not actively running. Respondents can volunteer their support for Kennedy or anyone else.)\n\nIn addition to being asked whom they'd support, respondents are given the option of saying they already voted. In this survey 1% had done so, a number likely to ramp up quickly.\n\nAs mentioned, one shift in this poll is the result among men who are registered to vote -- 52-44% in Trump's favor, compared with a dead heat, 48-48%, in mid-September. That includes a 19-point Trump lead among white men and a close contest among Hispanic men and younger men (age 18-39) alike.\n\nA slight change is among independents, who, per exit polls, have voted for the winner in nine out of the last 12 presidential elections. Harris led among independents by 10 points, 51-41%, in mid-September, compared with a non-significant 5 points now, 49-44%.\n\nVote Preference by Group ABC News, Ipsos poll\n\nHarris, for her part, continues to lead among women by 9 points, 53-44%, aided by her showing among under-40, Black and Hispanic women. And she leads by 14 points among college graduates, 56-42%, among the more reliable groups for turnout.\n\nThe 17-point gender gap between the candidates (Trump +8 among men, Harris +9 among women) is back to its typical level; it has averaged 19 points in exit polls since 1996. This reflects the fact that women are 8 points more apt than men to identify as Democrats.\n\nThe contest stands at 82-13%, Harris-Trump, among Black people who are registered to vote; that compares with 87-12% in the 2020 exit poll (a slight 5 points lower for Harris; no better for Trump). Black women are at 87-10% now (compared with 90-9% in 2020); Black men are at 76-18% (compared with 79-19% four years ago). These differences from 2020 aren't statistically significant.\n\nThen there's the division of votes by state groupings. In what are thought to be safely and likely red states, Trump is comfortably ahead, 55-42%. In expected blue states, Harris is well ahead, 56-39%. And in the seven battleground states where the contest is expected to be close -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- it couldn't be closer: 49% for Harris, 49% for Trump.\n\nMETHODOLOGY \u2013 This ABC News/Ipsos poll was conducted online via the probability-based Ipsos KnowledgePanel\u00ae Oct. 4-8, 2024, in English and Spanish, among a random national sample of 2,631 adults. Partisan divisions are 29-29-30%, Democrats-Republicans-independents. Results have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2 percentage points, including the design effect, for the full sample. Error margins are larger for subgroups. For registered voters, the sample size is 2,226 and the error margin is 2 points. For likely voters, the sample size is 1,714 and the error margin is 2.5 points. Sampling error is not the only cause of differences in polls.\n\nThe survey was produced for ABC News by Langer Research Associates, with sampling and data collection by Ipsos.

        "text": "Harris Begins Media Blitz as Trump Holds Rally in Wisconsin: Oct. 6 Campaign Updates\nDonald J. Trump returned to Butler, Pa., on Saturday for a massive rally at the fairgrounds where he was struck in July by a would-be assassin\u2019s bullet, an event envisioned by his campaign as a show of strength and a memorial for the former volunteer fire chief who was killed during the attack.\n\nHis speech quickly swung from a somber commemoration of the slain firefighter, Corey Comperatore, to a somewhat subdued, sanded-down version of his standard attacks on his opponent, complete with exaggerations and falsehoods. Mr. Trump commended his own performance in the face of adversity and brought out one of his biggest backers, the billionaire Elon Musk, who jumped up and down on the stage.\n\nFor Mr. Trump, who has been jarred by the changes in the presidential race since he was attacked in Butler on July 13, the rally served another purpose: It offered him a chance to seek something of a do-over after a series of major events reshaped the contest just as the Republican convention in Milwaukee ended.\n\nThe rally\u2019s stagecraft and programming \u2014 with singers, family members and friends serving as \u201ccharacter witnesses\u201d \u2014 echoed the convention\u2019s grandiosity, down to the same opera singer who closed out the proceedings in Milwaukee performing a handful of songs.\n\nPresident Biden announced he was dropping his 2024 bid three days after Mr. Trump\u2019s nominating convention, swamping all news coverage of the former president\u2019s near-death experience and resetting the race with a new, younger Democratic opponent almost immediately.\n\nSo in Butler on Saturday, Mr. Trump sought to recapture the same spirit that engulfed him in Milwaukee, where he was riding high in the polls as he was nominated for a third time just five days after the shooting.\n\nThe rally \u2014 which Mr. Trump was intent on holding \u2014 was marked by intense security, a sprawling crowd and some anxiety, with Mr. Trump having faced a second attempt on his life since July.\n\nMr. Trump, at a rally where other speakers bemoaned the overheated rhetoric in the campaign as leading to violence, seemed to focus on his victimhood, making a baseless suggestion at one point that the attempt on his life could have been the work of the same political opponents he has repeatedly accused of weaponizing impeachments and the criminal justice system against him.\n\nImage The crowd held signs that said \u201cFight! Fight! Fight!\u201d \u2014 echoing Mr. Trump\u2019s words after he was attacked. Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times\n\nFor a significant part of the day, Mr. Trump\u2019s team used the rally to honor Mr. Comperatore, who was killed during the assassination attempt in July as he shielded his wife and daughters from the gunfire. Mr. Comperatore\u2019s firefighter coat and helmet were placed in the stands behind the stage.\n\nMany in the crowd wore T-shirts reading \u201cFight! Fight! Fight!\u201d \u2014 quoting what Mr. Trump said right after his ear was grazed by a bullet in July. People stood in line for hours on Saturday in order to be part of the day, and were visibly delighted to be there.\n\nSeveral speakers mentioned Mr. Comperatore, with early speakers offering a somber reflection of the horror that had taken place at the fairgrounds less than three months earlier. And Mr. Trump, who met with Mr. Comperatore\u2019s family before his speech, opened his remarks by paying tribute to him.\n\n\u201cSome people just don\u2019t die in vain, and what he\u2019s left behind is incredible,\u201d Mr. Trump said. Later, he told his thousands of supporters how excited Mr. Comperatore had been to attend the rally in July.\n\n\u201cCorey had the best seat in the house,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cAnd he was telling his wife and family on the way over, he said, \u2018I\u2019m telling you, he\u2019s going to invite me up on the stage.\u2019\u201d Then, Mr. Trump added, \u201clittle did anyone realize that Corey would be on the stage three months later in an almost immortal position.\u201d\n\nThe efforts to humanize Mr. Trump \u2014 whose advisers were livid that Mr. Biden had ended what momentum they might have had coming out of their convention \u2014 began midway through the speaking program earlier in the day.\n\nSally Sherry, a paramedic who helped treat Mr. Trump at Butler Memorial Hospital in July, said she was moved to tears by his demeanor after the shooting as he reassured his family he was OK.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s running mate, Senator JD Vance of Ohio, commended Mr. Trump for returning to Butler. Mocking Ms. Harris, he asked the crowd who they would rather have dealing with foreign affairs: \u201csomeone who is afraid of interviews with the friendly American media or someone who faces down two assassins and returns triumphantly to the very place he got shot?\u201d\n\nTwo of Mr. Trump\u2019s friends in the business world, John Paulson and Steve Witkoff, offered testimonials. Then, Mr. Trump\u2019s son, Eric, and daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, gave speeches that had highlights of what they said at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. Mr. Trump entered to a live rendition of \u201cGod Bless the USA,\u201d the typical walk-on music played at his rallies, another moment borrowed from his convention.\n\nBut while the lead-up speeches before Mr. Trump took the stage were distinct for one of his rallies, and he made a dramatic entrance by taking the stage and declaring, \u201cAs I was saying,\u201d a reference to when he felt something strike his ear at the July 13 rally, his speech was mostly a fairly standard collection of his rally remarks.\n\nImage Elon Musk has been one of former President Donald J. Trump\u2019s biggest backers. Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times\n\nThe most dynamic moment of Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks came when he invited Mr. Musk to the stage. The billionaire, who endorsed Mr. Trump minutes after the assassination attempt, bounded up to the microphone, complained about a lack of laws requiring voter identification and warned ominously that November\u2019s election \u201cwill be the last election\u201d if Mr. Trump does not win.\n\nMr. Trump eased slightly off the starkly dark rhetoric with which he often describes the country, but frequently made exaggerated claims about immigration. At the start of his speech, he displayed a chart about the issue that he has credited with saving his life after he turned his head to look at it in July. But aspects of the graphic are highly misleading.\n\nMr. Trump also criticized Ms. Harris\u2019s previous support for a ban on fracking, an issue his campaign is hoping will energize voters in Pennsylvania, a critical battleground state. He repeated debunked claims about cheating in elections and fired up his base by talking about transgender athletes.\n\nAnd he mocked Ms. Harris as being insufficiently interested in those affected by Hurricane Helene, despite the fact that she spent Saturday on a trip to storm-ravaged North Carolina.\n\nKate Kelly contributed reporting.",

        "text": "KFF poll: Abortion is now the top election issue for young women, among shifts that favor Harris\nAbortion has emerged as the most important issue in the November election for women under 30, according to a survey by KFF \u2014 a notable change since late spring, before Vice President Kamala Harris entered the presidential race.\n\nNearly 4 in 10 women under 30 surveyed in September and early October told pollsters that abortion is the most important issue to their vote. Just 20 percent named abortion as their top issue when KFF conducted a similar survey in late May and early June.\n\nWATCH: Where Harris and Trump stand on abortion access and reproductive rights\n\nThe new survey found other shifts among women voters that stand to benefit Harris, including an increase of 24 percentage points in the number of women who said they were satisfied with their choice of candidates and a 19-point increase in the number who said they were more motivated to vote than in previous presidential elections. The changes suggest a significant setback among women in just a few months for former President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cIt looks worse for Donald Trump than it did back in June,\u201d said Ashley Kirzinger, director of survey methodology at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. \u201cHarris becoming the Democratic presidential nominee energized women voters in a way that the Biden candidacy had not.\u201d\n\nPresident Joe Biden abandoned his reelection bid on July 21, under pressure from Democratic Party leaders, after a stumbling performance in a June debate against Trump that reignited concerns about the 81-year-old\u2019s fitness for a second term.\n\nWhile women are more enthusiastic about voting for Harris than they were for Biden, the election remains close. Harris has a 2.5-point edge in national polls, according to a FiveThirtyEight analysis. Other polls have found a large gender divide in the election, with a majority of women backing Harris and a majority of men backing Trump.\n\nHarris has long been one of the Democratic Party\u2019s foremost advocates for abortion rights, and she has assailed Trump for appointing three conservative justices to the Supreme Court who joined in the 2022 ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 opinion that guaranteed abortion access nationally. Thirteen states have since banned abortion with few exceptions, according to KFF.\n\nTrump says the ruling merely returned the issue to states, and though his positions have often shifted, he has recently promised not to sign a national abortion ban. Harris says she would sign a law restoring nationwide abortion rights.\n\nThe former president has made sometimes awkward appeals to women voters.\n\n\u201cYou will be protected, and I will be your protector,\u201d Trump told women voters at a rally Sept. 23 in Indiana, Pennsylvania. \u201cWomen will be happy, healthy, confident, and free. You will no longer be thinking about abortion.\u201d\n\nThe KFF poll found that Harris is gaining on Trump among women not just on abortion \u2014 a subject the former president tries to downplay, acknowledging its political peril \u2014 but also on economic issues, which Trump and his advisers regard as among their strongest arguments for his return to the White House.\n\nMultiple polls have shown that the economy remains a top issue in the election, especially for Black and Hispanic women. About 75 percent of respondents in the KFF survey said they worry about household expenses \u201ca lot\u201d or \u201csome.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Hispanic women view Harris more positively than Hispanic men do, AP-NORC poll shows\n\nInflation was the top issue for 36 percent of KFF survey respondents overall, while 13 percent identified abortion as their priority.\n\nAbout 46 percent of women voters in the new poll said they trust Harris over Trump to address household costs, while 39 percent trust the former president more. Sixteen percent said neither.\n\nIn KFF\u2019s previous poll of women in the spring, respondents were nearly evenly split on which party they trusted more to address rising household costs. About 40 percent said they trusted neither party.\n\nOn health care costs, Harris holds a significant lead over Trump in the new poll, with 50 percent trusting her more on the issue, 34 percent trusting Trump more, and 16 percent trusting neither.\n\nKirzinger said Black women especially prefer Harris on economic issues; for example, they trust the vice president 7-to-1 over Trump on inflation, she said.\n\nMore than half of U.S. voters have been women in the last two national elections, according to the Census Bureau.\n\n\u201cA Democratic candidate needs to win women at very high rates and needs to enthuse the base \u2014 which largely consists of women,\u201d Kirzinger said. \u201cWhat we saw in early June was, the Biden candidacy was not doing that. Now it seems the Harris campaign is doing that in multiple different ways; it\u2019s not just abortion. It\u2019s her as a candidate making women more enthusiastic.\u201d\n\nThe KFF poll was conducted Sept. 12 to Oct. 1 among 649 women who had been surveyed in the spring, as well as a supplemental sample of 29 Black women registered voters. The margin of error was plus or minus 5 points.\n\nKFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF \u2014 an independent source of health policy research, polling, and journalism.

        "text": "Trump or Harris? Here are the 2024 stakes for airlines, banks, EVs, health care and more\nFormer President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris face off in the ABC presidential debate on Sept. 10, 2024. Getty Images\n\nWith the U.S. election less than a month away, the country and its corporations are staring down two drastically different options. For airlines, banks, electric vehicle makers, health-care companies, media firms, restaurants and tech giants, the outcome of the presidential contest could result in stark differences in the rules they'll face, the mergers they'll be allowed to pursue, and the taxes they'll pay. During his last time in power, former President Donald Trump slashed the corporate tax rate, imposed tariffs on Chinese goods, and sought to cut regulation and red tape and discourage immigration, ideas he's expected to push again if he wins a second term. In contrast, Vice President Kamala Harris has endorsed hiking the tax rate on corporations to 28% from the 21% rate enacted under Trump, a move that would require congressional approval. Most business executives expect Harris to broadly continue President Joe Biden's policies, including his war on so-called junk fees across industries. Personnel is policy, as the saying goes, so the ramifications of the presidential race won't become clear until the winner begins appointments for as many as a dozen key bodies, including the Treasury, Justice Department, Federal Trade Commission, and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. CNBC examined the stakes of the 2024 presidential election for some of corporate America's biggest sectors. Here's what a Harris or Trump administration could mean for business:\n\nAirlines\n\nThe result of the presidential election could affect everything from what airlines owe consumers for flight disruptions to how much it costs to build an aircraft in the United States. The Biden Department of Transportation, led by Secretary Pete Buttigieg, has taken a hard line on filling what it considers to be holes in air traveler protections. It has established or proposed new rules on issues including refunds for cancellations, family seating and service fee disclosures, a measure airlines have challenged in court. \"Who's in that DOT seat matters,\" said Jonathan Kletzel, who heads the travel, transportation and logistics practice at PwC. The current Democratic administration has also fought industry consolidation, winning two antitrust lawsuits that blocked a partnership between American Airlines and JetBlue Airways in the Northeast and JetBlue's now-scuttled plan to buy budget carrier Spirit Airlines. The previous Trump administration didn't pursue those types of consumer protections. Industry members say that under Trump, they would expect a more favorable environment for mergers, though four airlines already control more than three-quarters of the U.S. market. On the aerospace side, Boeing and the hundreds of suppliers that support it are seeking stability more than anything else. Trump has said on the campaign trail that he supports additional tariffs of 10% or 20% and higher duties on goods from China. That could drive up the cost of producing aircraft and other components for aerospace companies, just as a labor and skills shortage after the pandemic drives up expenses. Tariffs could also challenge the industry, if they spark retaliatory taxes or trade barriers to China and other countries, which are major buyers of aircraft from Boeing, a top U.S. exporter. \u2014 Leslie Josephs\n\nBanks\n\nBig banks such as JPMorgan Chase faced an onslaught of new rules this year as Biden appointees pursued the most significant slate of regulations since the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. Those efforts threaten tens of billions of dollars in industry revenue by slashing fees that banks impose on credit cards and overdrafts and radically revising the capital and risk framework they operate in. The fate of all of those measures is at risk if Trump is elected. Trump is expected to nominate appointees for key financial regulators, including the CFPB, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation that could result in a weakening or killing off completely of the myriad rules in play. \"The Biden administration's regulatory agenda across sectors has been very ambitious, especially in finance, and large swaths of it stand to be rolled back by Trump appointees if he wins,\" said Tobin Marcus, head of U.S. policy at Wolfe Research. Bank CEOs and consultants say it would be a relief if aspects of the Biden era \u2014 an aggressive CFPB, regulators who discouraged most mergers and elongated times for deal approvals \u2014 were dialed back. \"It certainly helps if the president is Republican, and the odds tilt more favorably for the industry if it's a Republican sweep\" in Congress, said the CEO of a bank with nearly $100 billion in assets who declined to be identified speaking about regulators. Still, some observers point out that Trump 2.0 might not be as friendly to the industry as his first time in office. Trump's vice presidential pick, Sen. JD Vance, of Ohio, has often criticized Wall Street banks, and Trump last month began pushing an idea to cap credit card interest rates at 10%, a move that if enacted would have seismic implications for the industry. Bankers also say that Harris won't necessarily cater to traditional Democratic Party ideas that have made life tougher for banks. Unless Democrats seize both chambers of Congress as well as the presidency, it may be difficult to get agency heads approved if they're considered partisan picks, experts note. \"I would not write off the vice president as someone who's automatically going to go more progressive,\" said Lindsey Johnson, head of the Consumer Bankers Association, a trade group for big U.S. retail banks. \u2014 Hugh Son\n\nEVs\n\nElectric vehicles have become a polarizing issue between Democrats and Republicans, especially in swing states such as Michigan that rely on the auto industry. There could be major changes in regulations and incentives for EVs if Trump regains power, a fact that's placed the industry in a temporary limbo. \"Depending on the election in the U.S., we may have mandates; we may not,\" Volkswagen Group of America CEO Pablo Di Si said Sept. 24 during an Automotive News conference. \"Am I going to make any decisions on future investments right now? Obviously not. We're waiting to see.\" Republicans, led by Trump, have largely condemned EVs, claiming they are being forced upon consumers and that they will ruin the U.S. automotive industry. Trump has vowed to roll back or eliminate many vehicle emissions standards under the Environmental Protection Agency and incentives to promote production and adoption of the vehicles. If elected, he's also expected to renew a battle with California and other states who set their own vehicle emissions standards. \"In a Republican win ... We see higher variance and more potential for change,\" UBS analyst Joseph Spak said in a Sept. 18 investor note. In contrast, Democrats, including Harris, have historically supported EVs and incentives such as those under the Biden administration's signature Inflation Reduction Act. Harris hasn't been as vocal a supporter of EVs lately amid slower-than-expected consumer adoption of the vehicles and consumer pushback. She has said she does not support an EV mandate such as the Zero-Emission Vehicles Act of 2019, which she cosponsored during her time as a senator, that would have required automakers to sell only electrified vehicles by 2040. Still, auto industry executives and officials expect a Harris presidency would be largely a continuation, though not a copy, of the past four years of Biden's EV policy. They expect some potential leniency on federal fuel economy regulations but minimal changes to the billions of dollars in incentives under the IRA. \u2014 Mike Wayland\n\nHealth care\n\nBoth Harris and Trump have called for sweeping changes to the costly, complicated and entrenched U.S. health-care system of doctors, insurers, drug manufacturers and middlemen, which costs the nation more than $4 trillion a year. Despite spending more on health care than any other wealthy country, the U.S. has the lowest life expectancy at birth, the highest rate of people with multiple chronic diseases and the highest maternal and infant death rates, according to the Commonwealth Fund, an independent research group. Meanwhile, roughly half of American adults say it is difficult to afford health-care costs, which can drive some into debt or lead them to put off necessary care, according to a May poll conducted by health policy research organization KFF. Both Harris and Trump have taken aim at the pharmaceutical industry and proposed efforts to lower prescription drug prices in the U.S., which are nearly three times higher than those seen in other countries. But many of Trump's efforts to lower costs have been temporary or not immediately effective, health policy experts said. Meanwhile, Harris, if elected, can build on existing efforts of the Biden administration to deliver savings to more patients, they said. Harris specifically plans to expand certain provisions of the IRA, part of which aims to lower health-care costs for seniors enrolled in Medicare. Harris cast the tie-breaking Senate vote to pass the law in 2022. Her campaign says she plans to extend two provisions to all Americans, not just seniors: a $2,000 annual cap on out-of-pocket drug spending and a $35 limit on monthly insulin costs. Harris also intends to accelerate and expand a provision allowing Medicare to directly negotiate drug prices with manufacturers for the first time. Drugmakers fiercely oppose those price talks, with some challenging the effort's constitutionality in court. Trump hasn't publicly indicated what he intends to do about IRA provisions. Some of Trump's prior efforts to lower drug prices \"didn't really come into fruition\" during his presidency, according to Dr. Mariana Socal, a professor of health policy and management at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. For example, he planned to use executive action to have Medicare pay no more than the lowest price that select other developed countries pay for drugs, a proposal that was blocked by court action and later rescinded. Trump also led multiple efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, including its expansion of Medicaid to low-income adults. In a campaign video in April, Trump said he was not running on terminating the ACA and would rather make it \"much, much better and far less money,\" though he has provided no specific plans. He reiterated his belief that the ACA was \"lousy health care\" during his Sept. 10 debate with Harris. But when asked he did not offer a replacement proposal, saying only that he has \"concepts of a plan.\" \u2014 Annika Kim Constantino\n\nMedia\n\nTop of mind for media executives is mergers and the path, or lack thereof, to push them through. The media industry's state of turmoil \u2014 shrinking audiences for traditional pay TV, the slowdown in advertising, and the rise of streaming and challenges in making it profitable \u2014 means its companies are often mentioned in discussions of acquisitions and consolidation. While a merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media is set to move forward, with plans to close in the first half of 2025, many in media have said the Biden administration has broadly chilled deal-making. \"We just need an opportunity for deregulation, so companies can consolidate and do what we need to do even better,\" Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav said in July at Allen & Co.'s annual Sun Valley conference. Media mogul John Malone recently told MoffettNathanson analysts that some deals are a nonstarter with this current Justice Department, including mergers between companies in the telecommunications and cable broadband space. Still, it's unclear how the regulatory environment could or would change depending on which party is in office. Disney was allowed to acquire Fox Corp.'s assets when Trump was in office, but his administration sued to block AT&T's merger with Time Warner. Meanwhile, under Biden's presidency, a federal judge blocked the sale of Simon & Schuster to Penguin Random House, but Amazon's acquisition of MGM was approved. \"My sense is, regardless of the election outcome, we are likely to remain in a similar tighter regulatory environment when looking at media industry dealmaking,\" said Marc DeBevoise, CEO and board director of Brightcove, a streaming technology company. When major media, and even tech, assets change hands, it could also mean increased scrutiny on those in control and whether it creates bias on the platforms. \"Overall, the government and FCC have always been most concerned with having a diversity of voices,\" said Jonathan Miller, chief executive of Integrated Media, which specializes in digital media investment.\n\n\"But then [Elon Musk's purchase of Twitter] happened, and it's clearly showing you can skew a platform to not just what the business needs, but to maybe your personal approach and whims,\" he said. Since Musk acquired the social media platform in 2022, changing its name to X, he has implemented sweeping changes including cutting staff and giving \"amnesty\" to previously suspended accounts, including Trump's, which had been suspended following the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection. Musk has also faced widespread criticism from civil rights groups for the amplification of bigotry on the platform. Musk has publicly endorsed Trump, and was recently on the campaign trail with the former president. \"As you can see, I'm not just MAGA, I'm Dark MAGA,\" Musk said at a recent event. The billionaire has raised funds for Republican causes, and Trump has suggested Musk could eventually play a role in his administration if the Republican candidate were to be reelected. During his first term, Trump took a particularly hard stance against journalists, and pursued investigations into leaks from his administration to news organizations. Under Biden, the White House has been notably more amenable to journalists. Also top of mind for media executives \u2014 and government officials \u2014 is TikTok. Lawmakers have argued that TikTok's Chinese ownership could be a national security risk. Earlier this year, Biden signed legislation that gives Chinese parent ByteDance until January to find a new owner for the platform or face a U.S. ban. TikTok has said the bill, the Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, which passed with bipartisan support, violates the First Amendment. The platform has sued the government to stop a potential ban. While Trump was in office, he attempted to ban TikTok through an executive order, but the effort failed. However, he has more recently switched to supporting the platform, arguing that without it there's less competition against Meta's Facebook and other social media. \u2014 Lillian Rizzo and Alex Sherman\n\nRestaurants\n\nBoth Trump and Harris have endorsed plans to end taxes on restaurant workers' tips, although how they would do so is likely to differ. The food service and restaurant industry is the nation's second-largest private-sector employer, with 15.5 million jobs, according to the National Restaurant Association. Roughly 2.2 million of those employees are tipped servers and bartenders, who could end up with more money in their pockets if their tips are no longer taxed. Trump's campaign hasn't given much detail on how his administration would eliminate taxes on tips, but tax experts have warned that it could turn into a loophole for high earners. Claims from the Trump campaign that the Republican candidate is pro-labor have clashed with his record of appointing leaders to the National Labor Relations Board who have rolled back worker protections. Meanwhile, Harris has said she'd only exempt workers who make $75,000 or less from paying income tax on their tips, but the money would still be subject to taxes toward Social Security and Medicare, the Washington Post previously reported. In keeping with the campaign's more labor-friendly approach, Harris is also pledging to eliminate the tip credit: In 37 states, employers only have to pay tipped workers the minimum wage as long as that hourly wage and tips add up to the area's pay floor. Since 1991, the federal pay floor for tipped wages has been stuck at $2.13. \"In the short term, if [restaurants] have to pay higher wages to their waiters, they're going to have to raise menu prices, which is going to lower demand,\" said Michael Lynn, a tipping expert and Cornell University professor. \u2014 Amelia Lucas\n\nTech",

        "text": "Why Ohio is not considered a swing state in this year\u2019s presidential election\nThe following article was originally published in the Ohio Capital Journal and published on News5Cleveland.com under a content-sharing agreement.\n\nWinning Ohio used to be crucial to winning the presidential election. This year, not so much.\n\nOhio used to be a key swing state in the presidential election for decades \u2014 meaning lots of political ads and campaign stops \u2014 but the tide shifted back in 2016, said Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics.\n\n\u201cThere was this educational realignment that Donald Trump supercharged in 2016 and it had the effect of changing a lot of states,\u201d he said. \u201cStates like Ohio and Iowa went from being purple states to red states.\u201d\n\nFifty-one percent of Ohio voted for former President Trump in 2016, who went on to win the election despite losing the popular vote. Fifty-three percent of Ohio voted for Trump in 2020, but President Joe Biden won the election.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ll look at 2016, historically speaking, as an important realigning election politically in lots of different places, but particularly Ohio because that\u2019s when it went from being a state that was very reflective of the nation to one that wasn\u2019t reflective of the nation anymore,\u201d said Kondik, who wrote \u201cThe Bellwether: Why Ohio Picks the President.\u201d His book was published June 2016.\n\nTrump is expected to win Ohio, which has 17 electoral votes, for the third time in a row in 2024. A recent Washington Post poll showed him leading by six points. Neither Harris or Trump have made campaign stops in Ohio recently. Trump was last in Ohio leading up to the state\u2019s March primary to drum up support for U.S. Senate candidate Bernie Moreno, who ended up securing the Republican nomination and is going up against Ohio U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown in a pivotal race for control over that chamber.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a state that seems to be particularly competitive (in this presidential election),\u201d Kondik said.\n\nArizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin are the key battleground states in the election for Vice President Kamala Harris and Trump.\n\nOhio\u2019s history as a swing state\n\nUp until 2020, Ohio had voted for the overall winning presidential candidate in every election since 1964. No Republican has won the presidential election without winning Ohio. Former President Barack Obama was the last Democratic presidential candidate to win Ohio in 2012.\n\n\u201cTrump has proven to be particularly popular among working class whites in northeastern Ohio, Cleveland, Akron area, as well as in Appalachia,\u201d said Paul Beck, professor emeritus and academy professor of political science at Ohio State University.\n\nRepublican candidates across the board have had much success in Ohio.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve had more candidates who have statewide recognition or visibility,\u201d Beck said. \u201cDemocrats have been hard pressed to find candidates who had that kind of visibility that could compete evenly or better with them in elections.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s possible Ohio could be a swing state again in the future, but things would have to change.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always possible that the demographic patterns that we\u2019ve seen recently could change in a way that maybe makes the state more competitive,\u201d Kondik said. \u201cI do think it would involve Democrats making up some ground with white working class voters which it\u2019s been a struggle for them with that group, and they\u2019ve been losing ground for a long time amongst that group. I also think that the Democrats just have to get much more out of the suburban counties than they do.\u201d\n\nFollow OCJ Reporter Megan Henry on X.\n\n",

The rally drew significant attention, especially after actor Dennis Quaid encouraged attendees to \u201cpick a side\u201d in a politically charged environment.Trump did not hold back in his assessment of California\u2019s current situation, stating, \u201cThe radical left Democrats have destroyed this state, but we are going to save it. We\u2019re going to make it better than ever before.\u201d He targeted Vice President Kamala Harris directly, declaring, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to let [Harris] destroy our country like she did San Francisco.\u201d The former president characterized California as \u201ca paradise lost\u201d but expressed optimism, asserting, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, we\u2019re gonna bring it back. It\u2019ll happen fast.\u201dIn a sweeping critique, Trump highlighted the state\u2019s challenges, saying, \u201cToday California has the highest inflation, the highest taxes, the highest gas prices, the highest cost of living, the most regulations, the most expensive utilities, the most homelessness, the most crime, the most decay, and the most illegal aliens. Other than that, I think you\u2019re doing quite well.\u201d He attributed these issues to policies pushed by Harris, whom he labeled a \u201cradical.\u201dTrump's critique of Harris included a reference to a recent statement she made on The View, where she indicated she would not change any Biden administration policies. \u201cKamala Harris got you into this mess, and only Trump can get you out of it,\u201d he said, emphasizing his intent to address the issues facing Californians.Actor Dennis Quaid's appearance added a notable celebrity aspect to the rally. Wearing a red MAGA hat and a blue T-shirt, Quaid urged the audience to \u201cpick a side\u201d and rallied support for Trump. He remarked, \u201cAre we gonna be a nation that stands for the Constitution or for TikTok?\u201dQuaid, who recently portrayed President Ronald Reagan in a film, drew comparisons between the current political climate and the 1980 election, which ushered Reagan into the presidency amid high inflation and national discontent. \u201cReagan is my favorite president of the 20th century,\u201d Quaid stated, \u201cDonald Trump is my favorite president of the 21st century.\u201dQuaid emphasized the importance of political participation, telling the crowd, \u201cWe can\u2019t sit on the sidelines anymore. The future of this country depends on all of us.\u201d His passionate message resonated with attendees eager for political change.Trump\u2019s rally at the Coachella festival, known primarily for its music and entertainment, marked an unconventional yet strategic attempt to engage with voters in a state that has historically favored Democratic candidates. Despite only capturing 34% of the California vote in the 2020 presidential election and 31% in 2016, Trump aimed to connect with frustrated voters feeling overlooked by current leadership. He remarked, \u201cCalifornia\u2019s potential is limitless, but it\u2019s being held back by terrible policies.\u201dIn addition to Harris, Trump took aim at Governor Gavin Newsom , calling him \u201cGavin Newscum\u201d and labeling him the \u201cworst governor in the country.\u201d He also criticized Congressman Adam Schiff, referring to him as \u201ca real low-life\u201d for his role in the Russia collusion investigation.The Coachella rally served as a platform for Trump to solidify his support among those seeking change as the 2024 election approaches. \u201cWith your vote, I will act with urgency and speed to save America and rescue the people of California from Kamala Harris\u2019 atrocious failures,\u201d he declared, underscoring his campaign\u2019s urgency.By combining political messaging with an engaging atmosphere, Trump aimed to energize his base and reach out to a broader audience, hoping to shift the political dynamics in a state that has long been a Democratic stronghold.",

        "text": "America's gun conundrum: Political implications for the 2024 presidential election\nAdvertisement America's gun conundrum: Political implications for the 2024 presidential election Share Copy Link Copy\n\nThe topic of guns is pervasive in American politics. It\u2019s also poignant and partisan. So, let's examine the contentious issue that could potentially determine the outcome of this year\u2019s election.This is a four-part series, breaking down the data, root causes, solutions and political implications of guns and gun violence in America. Here is Part 1, Part 2 and Part 3.This is Part 4: The political implications.On guns, former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris strongly reflect the state of the country: two sides starkly divided on foundational approaches, with some deviations interspersed.Trump, the Republican presidential nominee who is seeking a second term, is largely a committed gun rights advocate.\"I was proud to be the most pro-gun, pro-Second Amendment president you've ever had in the White House,\" Trump said at a National Rifle Association conference last year.During his first term, his administration opposed expanding the federal background check system to include private sales at gun shows and over the Internet by unlicensed dealers. He also opposed closing the so-called \u201cCharleston Loophole,\u201d which would extend the waiting periods for background checks from three days to 10 days.Additionally, he rescinded an Obama-era rule that would\u2019ve strengthened the reporting of mental illnesses to the FBI\u2019s National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). He also eased prohibitions on criminals obtaining guns by narrowing the definition of \"fugitive of law,\" which purged tens of thousands of records from the NICS.On top of that, Trump has continuously absolved the role of guns in mass shootings, suggesting stronger security measures, increased mental health attention and even arming teachers as more viable solutions.\"This is not a gun problem,\" he said at that same NRA conference last year. \"This is a mental health problem, this is a social problem, this is a cultural problem, this is a spiritual problem.\"State Rep. Bryan Fontenot, a Republican pro-gun rights legislator from Louisiana, appreciates Trump\u2019s perspective on the issue.\"The conversation should never really be about guns; the conversation needs to be about the crisis of mental health in this country,\" Fontenot said. \"We are not smart enough as a country to figure out that when someone has a mental illness, they shouldn\u2019t be able to purchase a gun.\"Addressing mental health\u2019s role in gun violence was actually a key component of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, a 2022 bill signed by President Joe Biden.The legislation earmarked over $750 million in funding for mental health services. So far, the Department of Health and Human Services has awarded nearly $245 million to support \"youth mental health, help the health care workforce address mental health needs, and fund other critical mental health supports.\"Aneesa McMillan, communications director for the Giffords Law Center, underlined the significance of the BSCA, noting that it was the first major piece of federal gun control legislation in 28 years.\"Common sense gun measures poll well not only with Democrats but also Republicans,\" McMillan said. \"That is one of the reasons why Vice President Harris and President Joe Biden were successful in passing the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which broke a nearly 30-year logjam on federal policy on the issue.\"The BSCA also extended background checks for firearm purchasers under the age of 21, tightened firearm license requirements, funded red flag laws at the state level, closed the so-called \"boyfriend loophole,\" and increased punishment for arms trafficking and straw purchases. Harris was, not surprisingly, a strong supporter of the bill. During her vice presidency, she took further steps to advocate for Extreme Risk Protection Orders (ERPOs), or red flag laws, and universal background checks.Her support for stricter gun laws goes back to her days as San Francisco district attorney from 2004 to 2011. In that office, she opposed pretrial release for people charged with gun crimes, cracked down on domestic abusers and worked with the state to craft some of the country's most expansive gun measures.In 2008, she worked with a group of lawyers to urge the Supreme Court to uphold a handgun ban in the landmark case, D.C. v. Heller. Her work was unsuccessful, as the court struck down the ban and ruled that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess firearms independent of service in a state militia and to use firearms for lawful purposes, including self-defense within the home.She continued her work on guns as California attorney general, overseeing gun sweeps to remove prohibited weapons, supporting restrictions for concealed carry and promoting microstamping.In the U.S. Senate, Harris co-sponsored bills to enact universal background checks, ban assault weapons, and increase oversight of federally licensed gun dealers.Other notable stances Harris has taken include advocating for the repeal of the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which shields gun manufacturers from liability, and backing a mandatory buyback program for assault weapons during her presidential run in 2019. She still maintains her support for an assault weapons ban.\"I feel very strongly that it\u2019s consistent with the Second Amendment to say we need an assault weapons ban,\" Harris said during an interview with a Philadelphia TV station earlier this month. \"They\u2019re literally tools of war; they were literally designed to kill a lot of people quickly.\"Harris and Trump have broken the mold of their gun views at times. As president, Trump signed the Fix NICS Act, a bipartisan bill that cleaned up the federal background check system and put parameters in place to increase coordination and efficiency. He also oversaw the Department of Justice\u2019s attempt to ban bump stocks in 2018, following the mass shootings in Las Vegas and Parkland, Florida. The Supreme Court, however, struck down that ban this year.Meanwhile, Harris has struck a more moderate tone on guns during her 2024 presidential campaign. \"We're not taking anyone\u2019s guns away, so stop with the continuous lying about this stuff,\" she said during the Sept. 10 debate with Trump, referring to his claims that she would \"confiscate everybody's gun\" if elected.She made headlines during a campaign event with Oprah Winfrey on Sept. 19, when she reconfirmed her ownership of a firearm and detailed her readiness to use it if need be.\"I'm a gun owner, (vice presidential candidate) Tim Walz is a gun owner\u2026 If somebody breaks into my house, they\u2019re getting shot,\" she said. \"Probably should not have said that. My staff will deal with that later.\"Fontenot said that, at the end of the day, neither candidate will move the needle on guns as much as Americans are led to believe, considering the influence of Congress and the courts.\"Every time there\u2019s a political election, there are winners and losers, and there are specific items that at some point come under attack,\" Fontenot said. \"President Trump has made his claim \u2026 that he believes in the Second Amendment gun rights. I think you\u2019ve seen Vice President Harris in the last debate say that she\u2019s a gun owner.\"He added, \"Any of those political maneuvers from the right or the left will ultimately be settled by the United States Supreme Court.\"McMillan, of Giffords Law Center, sees it differently. She believes there is a lot more at stake in this election.\"On the other side, you see almost this bragging, especially in the instance of Donald Trump, about not doing anything to address the problem,\" McMillan said. \"Which is a reflection of how we would approach this issue should he ascend to the White House for a second term.\"She added that her fear is that all of the progress made on addressing gun violence could be undone if Harris isn\u2019t elected to keep the momentum going.\"All of the initiatives \u2026 all of those key investments in legislation are at risk if we were to see a Trump/(JD) Vance administration because of how they have approached this issue, telling families to basically accept this as a way of life for Americans. It\u2019s unacceptable.\"",

        "text": "As US election nears, Mexico keeps up border enforcement, blocks migrants.\nMEXICO CITY \u2013 Fewer migrants are reaching the U.S. border than in years. The U.S. government's secret weapon in cutting illegal crossings?\n\nMexico.\n\nMexico is holding the line, analysts say, thanks to a carefully negotiated \u2013 but unwritten \u2013 agreement between neighbors, executed late last year by the Biden-Harris administration. It's held, they say, because it's in Mexico's economic interest to keep the border chaos-free and exports flowing north. And because the political stakes are high for Mexico in the upcoming U.S. presidential election.\n\nIllegal border crossings have been at the center of Republican Donald Trump's campaign.\n\nImmigration has been seen as one of Democrat Kamala Harris' weakest flanks. If Mexico lifted its checkpoints and eased its enforcement, it could sink Harris and buoy Trump, whose campaign has played on American fears and frustrations at the border.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nMexico's new President Claudia Sheinbaum is aware of her country's role in stopping migrants, and of the influence Mexico has in the U.S. presidential election, said Arturo Sarukha\u0301n, Mexico's former ambassador to the United States.\n\nKeeping up with Election 2024? Sign up for USA TODAY's On Politics newsletter for exclusive analysis.\n\n\"I\u2019m not arguing that they have explicitly decided to intervene or play a role in how Americans vote, but I think they are very aware of the role that Mexico plays in the context of the U.S. election,\" he said. Sheinbaum \"will try to ensure that migrant flows to the border don\u2019t impact that issue as Americans go to the polls in less than a month.\"\n\nMigrant encounters at the U.S. border plunged from nearly 250,000 in December of last year when urgent negotiations began, to below 60,000 last month, the lowest one-month total since the Trump administration, according to data provided to USA TODAY by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.\n\nAt the same time, Mexico's immigration agency reported a 160% increase in migrant encounters through the first seven months of this year, according to federal data.\n\nRefugees denied border access\n\nThe evidence of this policy shift can be seen 1,000 miles south of the U.S. border in the historic center of Mexico's capital.\n\nMari Eduvid Sarmiento and Samuel Malave Sarmiento spent weeks trying to make it out of Mexico's southern states on their journey to the U.S. border with their 12-year-old son, hiding from Mexican immigration agents and federal authorities. They only made it as far as the capital city.\n\nThe Venezuelan family's journey echoed the tales migrants used to tell of sneaking into the United States. \"Our passports were worthless,\" Eduvid Sarmiento said. \"We tried and tried and tried again.\"\n\nThey took taxis for short distances and at one point walked 13 hours through Mexico's southern Chiapas state to avoid highways and \"la migra,\" a word once reserved for U.S. Border Patrol. They sold coffee by the roadside until they reached Veracruz, where they climbed onto the roof of a cargo train, a decision that still gives Eduvid Sarmiento chills.\n\n\"It was like staring death in the face,\" she said.\n\nA decade, even five years ago, the Mexican government might have issued the Sarmiento family a seven-day travel visa, which many migrants used to reach the U.S. border by bus or plane. They could travel unobstructed, except for occasional bursts of enforcement when either the U.S. became frustrated or Mexico itself wished to reduce the number of migrants in its territory.\n\nInstead, the family only made it as far as Mexico City and were stuck, in late September, living in a tent in plaza crowded with dozens of other tents and lean-tos, where people from Venezuela, Cuba, Haiti, Angola and other countries were all struggling to keep out the rain.\n\nHad they made their journey nine months earlier, they might have faced fewer obstacles in Mexico en route to their dreamed-of destination, New York.\n\nIn December 2023, some 10,000 migrants per day were reaching the U.S. border.\n\nAnatomy of a U.S.-Mexico deal on migration\n\nPresident Joe Biden called his counterpart in Mexico four days before last Christmas.\n\nMonths of record migration had provoked humanitarian disasters in U.S. cities from El Paso, Texas, to Denver, Chicago and New York. The swell of migrants was already overwhelming city services and threatened \u2013 less than a year from the U.S. presidential election \u2013 to erupt into a political disaster for Democrats. A border security bill was being hashed out in Congress but its prospects looked grim.\n\nIt wasn't the first time Biden had discussed the border with Mexico. The two countries had made promises, including a commitment by Mexico in 2022 to spend $1.5 billion on infrastructure at its northern border over two years. Yet illegal crossings had still climbed to a record high.\n\nSix days after the presidential phone call, between the 2023 Christmas and New Year's holidays, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and White House adviser Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall got on a plane to the Mexican capital.\n\n\"I\u2019m sure what Blinken, Mayorkas, and Sherwood-Randall brought was a mix of carrots and sticks because the U.S. tends to operate that way,\" said Tony Payan, director for the Center for the U.S. and Mexico at Rice University's Baker Institute.\n\nOne \"stick\" was suspending traffic at five ports of entry between the U.S. and Mexico, including two key commercial rail crossings into Texas.\n\nMexico sends more than 80% of its exports to the U.S., worth more than $475 billion annually, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Mexico's economy takes a direct hit with every slowdown in cross-border commercial traffic.\n\n\"The demonstration of shutting the bridges to trade when Mexico is so dependent on trade was significant,\" Payan said.\n\nThe U.S. delegation came with \"specific asks\" for Mexico, according to senior State Department officials who spoke to USA TODAY on condition of anonymity to speak freely about the discussions. They included increased migration enforcement on cargo rail and passenger bus lines and for Mexico to \"decongest\" its northern border with the United States.\n\nRepeating a tactic from the Trump administration, the Biden-Harris administration in December reassigned customs officers to help Border Patrol process migrants. The closed ports \"got everybody's attention,\" one of the State Department officials said.\n\nIn response, Mexico quickly took a series of actions, including imposing visa requirements on migrants of certain nationalities and making it harder to seek asylum in Mexico, a system some migrants had used to travel safely to the U.S. border.\n\nThe country ramped up deportation flights to Guatemala and Honduras. Mexico also began a blitz of immigration enforcement along routes north \u2013 by bus, plane and train \u2013 that hasn't ended. Once apprehended, Mexican immigration agents transport migrants to the country's southern region, where they begin their trek northward all over again.\n\n\"People are being dumped on the street,\" said Gretchen Kuhner, director of the Mexico City-based Institute for Women in Migration.\n\nMexico has \"always had this carousel,\" she said, \"but it existed to pick up Central Americans and quickly return them. Now they are using the same idea to just tire people out. It opens all these spaces for extortion and violence and kidnapping.\"\n\nThe migrant 'carousel'\n\nEduvid Sarmiento sees no way out of Mexico City without an appointment issued by U.S. Customs and Border Protection on the CBP One app \u2012 one of the \"lawful pathways\" the Biden-Harris administration created to incentivize migrants to present at a port of entry. The family applied in August, with no answer yet.\n\nEarlier in the week another group of Venezuelans, a few dozen people, had tried to board a northbound cargo train. A young man named Yampier Sanchez shot a cellphone video of himself in a Los Angeles ball cap, the landscape rushing by in the background. Mexican immigration agents stopped the train less than two hours outside the city, he said, and put him and others on a bus to Villahermosa in Mexico's southern Tabasco state.\n\nThe same week, a video circulated on social media of a Mexican immigration raid on 10 apartments in a Mexico City borough where migrants were staying. Agents put at least 60 people on a bus, also to Villahermosa, according to a local news report.\n\nSarmiento and her husband and son had found informal work selling boxer shorts from a stand along a busy boulevard in Mexico City's historic center. They weaved between a crush of traffic and people selling clothes, pajamas, blankets and aprons. Sex workers waited by the roadside.\n\nThe relative safety of the city was a relief compared with the journey through Mexico, she said.\n\n\"Every day was a terror,\" said Malave Sarmiento, her husband. \"So much psychological trauma.\"\n\nTheir 12-year-old son sat on a plastic stool. It had been months since he'd gone to school.\n\n\"We were so afraid for him,\" she said.\n\n'Weaponizing' migration and putting people at risk\n\nSarukha\u0301n, the former ambassador, said Mexico has \"weaponized\" migration and turned an issue that requires \"shared responsibility\" into political leverage.\n\n\"I have never seen this type of leverage in the hands of Mexico in the contemporary U.S.-Mexico relationship,\" he said.\n\nAt the same time, Mexico has sacrificed the values that underpin its own immigration laws, Sarukha\u0301n said.\n\n\"We\u2019ve jettisoned Mexico\u2019s obligations under international conventions to adequately address the issues migrants face from organized crime and unscrupulous authorities who prey on them,\" he said.\n\nAndrew Selee, president of the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute said that, excepting trade, there are rarely written agreements between the U.S. and Mexico.\n\n\"It's always understandings,\" he said. \"What Mexico decided to do was something the U.S. had never even thought of: the carousel. That was a Mexican decision. There are policy conversations but, ultimately, each government is making its own decisions.\"\n\nMexico's immigration agency doesn't speak publicly about its tactics and a communications spokesman for Sheinbaum's transition team declined an interview request.\n\nWithout an agreement on paper, it's unclear to what extent the U.S. endorses Mexico's tactics.\n\nThe U.S. isn't paying for Mexico's migration enforcement programs, according to State Department officials. The United States provided nearly $87 million in \"humanitarian assistance for refugees, asylum seekers and vulnerable migrants in Mexico\" in fiscal 2023, according to a State Department spokesman.\n\nMigrant crisis under control \u2012 for now\n\nThe first two years of the Biden administration produced record highs in migrant encounters, more than 2 million each year in 2021 and 2022. The surge was driven in part by pent-up demand for jobs after the global pandemic shut down travel and depressed economies.\n\nAlong the U.S.-Mexico border, the number of migrants encountered by Border Patrol agents dropped in half immediately after the Cabinet secretaries rushed to Mexico City.\n\nMigrant encounters plummeted again after the White House issued an executive order in June restricting asylum at the U.S. border. The number dropped below 60,000 in July, August and September.\n\nOn Sept. 30, the Biden-Harris administration further cemented its executive order with a final rule restricting asylum access at the U.S. border.\n\nWhether Mexico, and Sheinbaum's newly inaugurated government will keep up the enforcement regime is an open question. Last week, she named a new head of the country's National Migration Institute, whose current leader is facing criminal charges in the deaths of 40 migrants in a migration detention center fire in 2023.\n\nState Department officials told USA TODAY there is an informal commitment that Sheinbaum will continue Mexico's enforcement regime.\n\n\"They are aware, for different political reasons,\" Sarukha\u0301n, the former ambassador, said, \"that what they do on the ground in Mexico does have a potential impact on the outcome of the election in November.\"\n\nLauren Villagran can be reached at lvillagran@usatoday.com.",

        "text": "Immigration: Where do Trump and Harris stand? \u2022 North Dakota Monitor\nThis is one in a series of States Newsroom reports on the major policy issues in the presidential race.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Immigration remains at the forefront of the 2024 presidential election, with both candidates taking a tougher stance than in the past on the flow of migrants into the United States.\n\nGOP presidential candidate Donald Trump has made immigration a core campaign issue, as he did in his two previous bids for the White House, and has expanded his attacks this time around to include false claims about migrants with legal status in specific locations like Springfield, Ohio.\n\nHe\u2019s often demonized immigrants in speeches and at rallies, and has vowed to enact the mass deportation of millions of people living in the United States without authorization.\n\nDemocratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, like the Biden administration, has shifted to the right on immigration, embracing limits to asylum and advocating for added border security, as migrant encounters hit a record high at the end of 2023. With those new policies in place, migrant encounters have sharply fallen this year.\n\nVice President Harris in her remarks on immigration has mainly stuck to her promise to sign into law a bipartisan border security deal that three senators struck earlier this year. That legislation, if enacted, would have been the most drastic change in U.S. immigration law in decades.\n\nThe deal never made it out of the Senate. Once Trump expressed his displeasure with the bill, House Republicans pulled their support, and the GOP in the upper chamber followed suit.\n\nHarris has not detailed her positions on immigration beyond her support of the border security bill.\n\nRegardless of who wins the White House, the incoming administration will be tasked with the fate of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which protects a little over half a million undocumented people brought into the United States as children without authorization. A Texas legal challenge threatens the legality of the program, and the case could make its way up to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nAdditionally, work visas, massive backlogs in U.S. immigration courts and renewing those individuals in Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, will fall to the next administration. Neither candidate has laid out how they would handle those issues.\n\nThe Trump campaign did not respond to States Newsroom\u2019s request for comment.\n\nThe Harris campaign pointed to the vice president\u2019s remarks from an Arizona campaign rally where she acknowledged the U.S. has a broken immigration system and put her support behind border security and legal pathways to citizenship.\n\nHarris also took a September trip to the southern border.\n\nPromise: border security deal\n\nHarris has made the bipartisan border deal a centerpiece of her campaign. She\u2019s often promised to sign it into law and has used the proposal to criticize Trump.\n\n\u201cWe can create an earned pathway to citizenship and secure our border,\u201d Harris said during the Democratic National Convention in August.\n\nThe bill negotiated by senators would need to reach the 60-vote threshold to advance through the chamber. But after Trump came out against it and it was brought to the floor, the Republican who handled negotiations with Democrats and the White House, Oklahoma\u2019s James Lankford, voted against his own bill.\n\nAdditionally, House Democrats in the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and immigration groups were not supportive of the bill.\n\n\u201cI will bring back the bipartisan border security bill that he killed, and I will sign it into law,\u201d Harris said at the DNC.\n\nThe measure raises the bar for asylum, and would require asylum seekers to provide greater proof of their fear of persecution.\n\nThe bill would have also provided $20 billion for the hiring of more than 4,000 asylum officers, legal counsel for unaccompanied minors and the purchase of drug screening technology at ports of entry. It would also have provided $8 billion for detention facilities to add 50,000 detention beds.\n\nThe plan did include some legal pathways to citizenship for Afghans who aided the U.S. and fled in 2021 after the U.S. withdrew from the country. It also provided up to 10,000 special visas for family members of those Afghan allies.\n\nIt also would have added 250,000 green-card employee and family-based visas over the next five years.\n\nPromise: mass deportations\n\n\u201cSend them back,\u201d is chanted at Trump\u2019s rallies, where he often promises to carry out mass deportations.\n\nThere are roughly 11 million people in the U.S. without legal authorization.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have the largest deportation,\u201d Trump said at a June campaign rally in Racine, Wisconsin. \u201cWe have no choice.\u201d\n\nUnder Trump\u2019s vision, mass deportation would be a broad, multipronged effort that includes invoking an 18th-century law; reshuffling law enforcement at federal agencies; transferring funds within programs in the Department of Homeland Security; and forcing greater enforcement of immigration laws.\n\nPromise: an end to birthright citizenship\n\nIn a May 2023 campaign video, Trump said if he wins the White House, one of his first moves would be to issue an executive order ending birthright citizenship, which means anyone born in the U.S., regardless of their parents\u2019 status, is an American citizen.\n\nThis is enshrined in the 14th Amendment of the Constitution and would likely face legal challenges.\n\n\u201cAs part of my plan to secure the border, on Day One of my new term in office, I will sign an executive order making clear to federal agencies that under the correct interpretation of the law, going forward, the future children of illegal aliens will not receive automatic U.S. citizenship,\u201d Trump said.\n\nPromise: deportation of pro-Palestinian students on visas\n\nAcross the country, students on college campuses during the past year have set up encampments and protests calling for a cease-fire in Gaza and an end to the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nIn the initial attack on Oct. 7, 2023, more than 1,200 people were killed in Israel and hundreds taken hostage. As the war has continued, researchers estimate that as many as 186,000 Palestinians have been killed, directly and indirectly.\n\nAt a private dinner in May, Trump told donors that \u201cany student that protests, I throw them out of the country,\u201d according to the Washington Post.\n\n\u201cYou know, there are a lot of foreign students,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAs soon as they hear that, they\u2019re going to behave.\u201d\n\nTrump also made that vow during a campaign rally in October 2023 in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll terminate the visas of all of Hamas\u2019 sympathizers, and we\u2019ll get them off our college campuses, out of our cities and get them the hell out of our country, if that\u2019s OK with you,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Republican party made it part of its party platform in July.\n\nPromise: an end to parole programs\n\nWith immigration reform stalled in Congress, one way the Biden administration has handled mass migration is the use of humanitarian parole programs. Those humanitarian parole programs have been used for Ukrainians fleeing the war with Russia, Afghans fleeing after the U.S. withdrawal and for Cubans, Haitians and Nicaraguans.\n\nMore than 1 million people have been paroled into the U.S. under the executive authority extended by the Biden administration.\n\nTrump said in a November 2023 campaign video he would end this policy on his first day in office.\n\n\u201cI will stop the outrageous abuse of parole authority,\u201d Trump said.\n\nPromise: green cards for foreign students\n\nIn a June podcast interview, Trump said that he was supportive of giving green cards to foreign students if they graduate from a U.S. college.\n\n\u201cWhat I will do is, if you graduate from a college, I think you should get, automatically as part of your diploma, a green card to be able to stay in this country,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThat includes junior colleges, too.\u201d\n\nThis would be done through rulemaking from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.\n\nOn the podcast, Trump also said he would extend H-1B visas for tech workers. Those visas allow employers to hire foreign workers for specialized occupations, usually for a high skill role.\n\nPromise: more screenings of immigrants\n\nOn social media, the Trump campaign said it would put in place an \u201cideological screening\u201d for all immigrants and bar those who have sympathies toward Hamas.\n\nPromise: Trump-era immigration policies\n\nTrump has stated in various campaign speeches that he plans to reinstate his immigration policies from his first term.\n\nThat would include the continuation of building a wall along the southern border; reissuing a travel ban on individuals from predominantly Muslim countries; suspending travel of refugees; reinstating a public health policy that barred migrants from claiming asylum amid the coronavirus pandemic; and reinstating the remain in Mexico policy that required asylum seekers to remain in Mexico while awaiting their cases.",

        "text": "Foreign policy: Where do Harris and Trump stand? \u2022 New Jersey Monitor\nThis is one in a series of States Newsroom reports on the major policy issues in the presidential race.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The next U.S. president must steer the nation through crises across the globe, including worsening violence in the Middle East, Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s refusal to retreat from Ukraine and U.S-China trade relations.\n\nThe Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, largely built her career as a prosecutor, but once in Washington she sat on the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, a position that comes with access to highly classified national security files.\n\nAs vice president she\u2019s represented the U.S. at high-profile international meetings, including the Munich Security Conference and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation.\n\nThe Republican nominee, former President Donald Trump, who followed his wealthy father\u2019s path into real estate and ascended to the status of celebrity businessman, has already held the elected position of Commander-in-Chief for four years \u2014 though high-ranking officials who served under him say he should not occupy that seat again.\n\nTrump and Harris\u2019 track records can provide clues on how, if elected, they would handle complex and challenging national and economic security policies.\n\nBut overall on the campaign trail, foreign policy \u201chas played a back seat role to domestic politics in the 2024 election,\u201d James M. Lindsay, a senior fellow in U.S. foreign policy for the Council on Foreign Relations, told States Newsroom in an interview.\n\nThat\u2019s not unusual, Lindsay said, as presidential year politics generally tend to have a domestic focus.\n\n\u201cThis has been more a campaign about personalities than about specific policy prescriptions. It\u2019s safe to say that the two candidates have very different world views,\u201d Lindsay said.\n\nRelationships with allies\n\nHarris centers relationship building, and promised in her Democratic National Convention acceptance speech to \u201cstand strong\u201d with NATO allies.\n\nIn Trump\u2019s convention speech he lamented that the U.S. has \u201clong been taken advantage of\u201d by \u201cso-called allies.\u201d\n\nObservers say the former president leads with a transactional outlook: In other words, nations must pay for access to U.S. markets and security.\n\n\u201cTrump thinks that U.S. support to allies is a bad deal for America, whereas Harris realizes that the United States benefits immensely from them,\u201d Matthew Waxman, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and chair of Columbia Law School\u2019s National Security Law Program, told States Newsroom.\n\nBut predicting how a presidential candidate would act on the global stage, if elected, is tricky. Conflicts continue to evolve, and those in top defense and diplomatic jobs are likely to turn over.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s partly because a President Harris or President Trump could face a very different situation in the Middle East or in Ukraine come Inauguration Day, but it\u2019s also because in Washington personnel are policy, people are policy,\u201d Lindsay said.\n\nHere are some of the serious international situations either administration will face:\n\nMiddle East\n\nThe deadly Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas attack on Israel, launched from the Palestinian territory of the Gaza Strip, reignited smoldering regional tensions and highlighted the inextricable U.S. role. Hamas militants killed roughly 1,200 in the brutal and unexpected incursion, and took 250 hostages, many of whom still remain in captivity.\n\nPresident Joe Biden immediately surged weapons and security aid to the key U.S. defense partner, and in April Congress approved his request for $8.7 billion more in foreign military financing and missile defense.\n\nIsrael\u2019s year-long campaign to completely eliminate Iranian-allied Hamas militants from the Gaza Strip has resulted in a staggering death toll, now over 41,000, according to Gaza health officials.\n\nHamas\u2019 assault also set in motion attacks from other Iranian-backed militias, opening up a war front between Israel and Hezbollah fighters to the north in Lebanon. And for months, Yemen\u2019s Iranian-backed Houthis have terrorized commercial shipping in the Red Sea.\n\nBiden has faced fierce criticism for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s war tactics.\n\nHarris, as early as March, publicly criticized Israel over the humanitarian \u201ccatastrophe\u201d in Gaza and called for an immediate six-week cease-fire.\n\nHarris, who became the Democratic presidential nominee in mid-summer after Biden dropped his bid, has repeatedly said she defends Israel\u2019s right to defend itself but that \u201chow it does so matters.\u201d\n\nProtesters could be heard in the distance Monday as Harris planted a memorial tree at the vice president\u2019s residence to mark the one-year anniversary of the Oct. 7 attack. Pro-Palestinian activists protesting the death toll in Gaza have marched and rallied throughout the U.S. during the past year.\n\nHarris told reporters that the administration is \u201cnot giving up\u201d on negotiating a cease-fire deal and release of hostages, an effort that has so far floundered.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the most important ways we will be able to end this war and bring any type of stability to the region. It\u2019s one of the highest priorities of this administration,\u201d she said.\n\nShe has not indicated any slowdown or conditions on assistance to Israel if elected \u2014 though she continues to advocate for a two-state solution.\n\n\u201cTrump may give Jerusalem less public chastising and criticism, but I\u2019m not sure the policy differences would be that great either,\u201d Michael O\u2019Hanlon, senior fellow and foreign policy research director at the Brookings Institution, told States Newsroom. O\u2019Hanlon recently published an article arguing the Trump and Harris defense strategies would at least \u201cpartially\u201d converge.\n\nTrump maintains that Oct. 7 \u201cwould never have happened\u201d had he been in office, and he accuses the Biden administration of inviting the attack because of its \u201cweak\u201d relationship with Iran.\n\n\u201cWhat is needed more than ever is a return of unwavering American leadership and unquestioned American strength. We were strong, we were powerful \u2026 That\u2019s what I intend to deliver as the 47th president of the United States,\u201d he said Monday while in Miami marking one year since the ambush on Israel.\n\nThe attack also wrecked any forward progress on the Abraham Accords \u2014 Trump\u2019s signature Middle East achievement that created full diplomatic relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco. While those established channels remain steady, the Biden administration\u2019s efforts to strike a deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia are now at a standstill.\n\nTrump is increasingly selling himself on the campaign trail as the candidate of stability who can quash Iran\u2019s aggression \u2014 which is pretty much a \u201cstandard approach to campaigning,\u201d Lindsay said.\n\n\u201cHe is not the first challenger to argue that the incumbent president has been weak.\u201d\n\nBut Lindsay said, \u201cthe important question isn\u2019t whether he was tougher, it\u2019s whether his policies were more effective.\u201d\n\nFor example, the Iranian-backed so-called \u201caxis of resistance\u201d militias currently upending the Middle East were also operating during Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\n\u201c(They) pre-dated his coming into office but it\u2019s not that a Trump administration ended that network of anti-Western, anti-Israeli groups,\u201d Lindsay said. \u201cAnd during the Trump administration it was the case that Iran both underwrote attacks on American troops and actually launched attacks on American troops.\u201d\n\nTrump drew attention last week to an early January 2020 barrage on U.S. troops in Iraq when he again described the traumatic brain injuries they suffered as \u201cheadaches.\u201d\n\nU.S. troops in Iraq and Syria, already a target, have come under increasing fire from Iran-backed militants, with more than 100 attacks on U.S. service members since Israel began its post-Oct. 7 offensive. A drone strike in January killed three U.S. soldiers and injured 30 at an outpost in Jordan on the Syrian border. The U.S. retaliated by launching more than 100 precision rockets at 85 of Iran military sites in Iraq and Syria.\n\nThe U.S. assisted Israel twice in 2024 in intercepting rockets fired directly from Iran \u2014 once in April following Israel\u2019s bombing of the Iranian embassy in Damascus, and again in September after Israel\u2019s assassination of Iranian-backed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut, Lebanon.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the last months of the Biden presidency, and Biden\u2019s own, I think, personal influence here is quite diminished. And you know, I can\u2019t predict what Trump policy really would be. I assume he would be less likely to be trying to restrain the Israelis, but so is the Biden administration. And maybe that is a Biden-Harris policy,\u201d Elliott Abrams, CFR\u2019s senior fellow for Middle Eastern Studies, told reporters on Oct. 2, the day after Iran launched its second direct attack.\n\nUkraine and NATO\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with both Harris and Trump in recent weeks to shore up continued U.S. support for his country\u2019s ongoing war against Russia\u2019s occupation.\n\nHarris\u2019 meeting with the Ukrainian leader was her seventh, and she pledged continued aid for the eastern European nation on the principle that Putin would continue marching into Europe if allies relent on Ukraine.\n\nHarris supports continued U.S. assistance, which has totaled roughly $175 billion since 2022. At the Ukraine peace summit in Switzerland in June, Harris pledged nearly $2 billion, some new and some redirected, to bolster the country\u2019s energy sector and add to humanitarian efforts.\n\nThe vice president has represented the U.S. three times at the annual Munich Security Conference in Germany, where she praised the NATO alliance and said the U.S. commitment to its principles is \u201cironclad.\u201d\n\nWhen facing Harris on the presidential debate stage in September, Trump refused to answer whether he wants Ukraine to be victorious over Russia.\n\nTrump\u2019s rhetoric and past behavior \u201cspells bad news for Ukraine,\u201d Waxman said.\n\n\u201cHe is likely to reduce American support for Ukraine and push Ukraine to make concessions to Russia. Overall, Trump\u2019s transactional approach to leader-to-leader diplomacy is likely to benefit Putin,\u201d Waxman continued. \u201cWhereas Harris wants to invest in alliances like NATO, Trump is skeptical of them.\u201d\n\nThat type of leader-to-leader communication was notoriously highlighted in 2019 when U.S. House lawmakers impeached Trump for directly threatening to withhold Ukraine aid if Zelenskyy did not announce an investigation into Biden \u2014 Trump\u2019s presidential campaign rival at the time. The Senate acquitted Trump.\n\nLike his campaign line on the Israel attack, Trump also repeatedly claims that had he been in office, instead of Biden, Russia would have never launched its February 2022 attack on Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThe war in Ukraine did not begin in February of \u201822, it began back in 2014,\u201d Lindsay said, referring to Putin\u2019s forced annexation of the Crimean Peninsula.\n\nTrump\u2019s own administration expanded Obama-era sanctions meant to punish Russia\u2019s actions in Crimea.\n\n\u201cExperts can argue about how to dole out criticism across administrations, but clearly the issue of Russian support for a notionally independent insurrection in eastern Ukraine was not solved during the Trump presidency,\u201d Lindsay continued.\n\nChina and trade\n\nForeign trade is a \u201cpolitical hot potato,\u201d and neither Harris nor Trump are offering much clarity for U.S. trading partners around the world, Mary E. Lovely, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told States Newsroom in an interview.\n\nLovely described the Biden-Harris approach as multipronged, in that they\u2019ve instituted policies to bring manufacturing back to the U.S. while also aiming to maintain good trade relationships with partner nations.\n\nThe tightrope walk becomes even trickier as U.S. policy also disincentivizes materials and components from China \u2014 one of the world\u2019s largest trading nations \u2014 in the final products imported from trading partners. Think: components in solar panels and electric vehicles.\n\nThe Biden administration\u2019s major legislative accomplishments \u2014 the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS and Science Act \u2014 provided major subsidies for \u201creshoring,\u201d or returning to the U.S., clean energy and semiconductor production. But the policies were not without risks to U.S. trading partners.\n\n\u201cWe had a lot of things (in the legislation), including things that upset the allies \u2014 you know, subsidies for American businesses, that they saw potentially as pulling investment out of their economies,\u201d Lovely said.\n\n\u201cThese are things that the European Union, Japan, Korea were concerned about,\u201d Lovely continued. \u201cSo we\u2019ve seen it there \u2014 this tension between foreign policy and this idea of economic security.\u201d\n\nWhile Lovely said she worries about how some of the Biden-Harris trade policies might affect competition and the nation\u2019s ability to sign timely trade agreements, she said Trump\u2019s plans are overall \u201cdestabilizing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe increased use of tariffs is misguided at best,\u201d Lovely said.\n\nTrump\u2019s promise to not only increase tariffs on Chinese imports to 60%, but also to slap flat 10% to 20% tariffs on all imports across the board is akin to \u201cstarting a trade war with the entire world.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to see those kinds of tariffs without retaliation,\u201d Lovely said.\n\nIf enacted, the tariffs would be particularly challenging for Indo-Pacific countries that rely on U.S. partnership in the face of China\u2019s regional dominance.\n\n\u201cI mean, you can imagine how this will go down in, say, Japan and Korea, two countries which rely on the U.S. for a security umbrella, which is why Trump thinks that he can do stuff to them. But they also have to protect their own economies,\u201d Lovely said. \u201cSo it\u2019s going to put them in a really terrible position because it\u2019s very important for them to maintain their alliance with the U.S., economic as well as military.\u201d\n\nBut one thing is for sure, Lovely said: \u201cEverybody wants to know what\u2019s going to happen. Everybody in every embassy here in Washington.\u201d",

        "text": "Trump calls for adding 10,000 Border Patrol agents after derailing a bipartisan border bill\nPRESCOTT VALLEY, Ariz. (AP) \u2014 Former President Donald Trump on Sunday proposed hiring 10,000 additional Border Patrol agents and giving them a $10,000 retention and signing bonus, after he derailed a bipartisan bill earlier this year that included funding for more border personnel.\n\nTrump made his pledge during a rally in Prescott Valley, Arizona, roughly 260 miles north of the state\u2019s border with Mexico. He accepted an endorsement from the agents\u2019 union, the National Border Patrol Council, which is a longtime Trump backer that endorsed him during his prior two campaigns.\n\nTrump has made illegal immigration the focus of his campaign and blamed Vice President Kamala Harris, his Democratic opponent, for a record spike in unauthorized crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border. He frequently denounces people entering the U.S. illegally as invaders and criminals, and he has vowed to stage the largest deportation operation in American history if he is elected president again.\n\nHe did defy the union earlier this year when he convinced Republicans to kill a bipartisan immigration bill that contained additional border resources. According to the White House, the bill would have funded 1,500 personnel at U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which includes the Border Patrol.\n\nTrump at the time said he did not want to give Democrats a political victory on his key issue. At the rally, Trump contended the legislation was \u201ca horrible bill.\u201d\n\nWhat to know about Trump\u2019s second term:\n\nStaffing the administration: Here are the people Trump has picked recess appointments Follow all of our coverage as Donald Trump assembles his second administration.\n\nTrump and his allies routinely call Harris the \u201cborder czar,\u201d even though she\u2019s never had that title. President Joe Biden did ask Harris early in his administration to study the \u201croot causes\u201d of migration from Central America.\n\n\u201cIf we allow Border Czar Harris to win this election, every city, every community in this great country is going to go to hell,\u201d union president Paul Perez said as he stood next to Trump on stage with a group of agents.\n\nMatt Corridoni, a spokesperson for the Harris campaign, noted Trump\u2019s move against the border bill and his vows that Mexico would pay for his signature border wall, which ultimately was funded by the U.S. government.\n\n\u201cTrump doesn\u2019t care about solving problems, he only wants to run on one,\u201d Corridoni said in a statement.\n\nTrump has vowed to complete a border wall if he\u2019s returned to the White House. He routinely trumpets his comparatively low numbers of border crossings with the much higher ones during Biden\u2019s first three years in office, though currently crossings are back down to levels at or below those seen during most of Trump\u2019s term.\n\nTrump\u2019s term was also marked by a struggle to crack down on illegal crossings before the COVID-19 pandemic led to international border closures. Under his administration, Border Patrol agents separated immigrant children from their parents, one of several enforcement programs the Trump administration implemented to target illegal immigration.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump said that Border Patrol agents deserved the higher pay and bonuses and bemoaned how he said Biden and Harris had neglected the border.",

        "text": "US Presidential Elections: Kamala Harris' Indian roots will be a significant advantage in the elections: Brookings Institute professor\nKamala Harris and Donald Trump\n\nThe US presidential election is set for November 5. With just three weeks remaining before the critical US presidential election, both vice president Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are intensifying their campaigns.In the crucial swing state of Pennsylvania, Trump held two rallies this week, while Harris enlisted the help of former President Barack Obama to rally support for the Democrats. Polls indicate a remarkably close race, with both candidates holding narrow leads in various surveys.In an interview with ANI, Professor Cameron Kerry of the Brookings Institution said that the race is \"extremely tight\" and both the candidates have strong chances of winning. He highlighted that while the momentum initially favoured Trump, Harris's strong performance in the second presidential debate has made the race competitive again.\u201cIt is a very close race. I think a Wall Street Journal poll put it well: \u2018Even, Steven, tight, tight, tight.\u2019 Kamala Harris has brought the race back from a point where it seemed to be tilting toward Trump,\u201d Kerry said. He added that the United States remains deeply polarised politically, with both parties fighting over narrow issues.According to Professor Kerry, voter turnout will be crucial in the final weeks, as each candidate will need to mobilise their supporters effectively, particularly as concerns about tensions in the Middle East and Ukraine grow.He also highlighted that the American voter is now prioritising domestic issues such as the economy, immigration, and foreign policy, simultaneously making these issues important for the perception of leadership and safety.Trump has frequently criticised the Biden administration, claiming that the US has lost its standing on the global stage. He claims that the conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine would not have emerged if he had been in office, he also promises to end both conflicts swiftly if he returns to the White House.He highlighted the different views on America's role in the world, with Trump advocating an \"America first\" policy and Biden, along with Harris, focusing on rebuilding international alliances.The issue of abortion is another critical factor shaping this election. Kerry believes that the Democrats will benefit from strong support for abortion rights , particularly following the overturning of the Roe v. Wade judgement. This issue energised voters during the 2022 midterms, and Kerry expects it will have a similar effect in the upcoming election.\"There has been a clear divide between the parties on abortion rights. Trump's attempts to soften his stance may not resonate well,\" he said.While Biden and Harris have vowed to bring back the abortion rights, the Republicans have had opposing views on the matter. Trump's running mate, JD Vance, has registered even stronger opposition to abortion rights.\"There's long been a so-called gender gap in American politics where women vote more for Democrats. But the polling now shows those numbers have doubled compared to what they were when we first started talking about a gender gap 25 or 30 years ago,\" Kerry said.Kerry also addressed the implications of Trump's ongoing legal troubles, which include 91 felony charges across four criminal cases. He suggested that while Trump's base remains loyal, the criminal allegations could concern undecided voters.\"It\u2019s extraordinary that Trump continues to raise funds despite these indictments. His supporters seem to believe in him regardless, but the fact that he is the first former president convicted of a crime will unsettle some voters,\" he said.Furthermore, Kerry believes Kamala Harris's Indian roots will be a significant advantage in the elections, potentially leading to strong support from the Indian-American community . He said that this community is becoming increasingly influential in key sectors across the US.\"It's definitely an advantage. People in the Indian-American community are excited and engaged. They play important roles in business, science, and technology, making them a powerful group,\" Kerry said.\"The possibility of having the first Indian-American president is very exciting. However, it's important to remember that no community is uniform in its views. While some will support Harris, I don't have specific data on that. Still, based on my political experience, I believe a large majority of Indian-Americans will back Kamala Harris,\" he added.As the election nears, both candidates are set to make history. If Trump wins, he will become the first president in over a century to serve two non-consecutive terms. Conversely, Harris could become the first woman, first Black, and first Asian American president in US history.",

        "text": "Tim Walz coming back to Nebraska's 2nd District for Harris on Oct. 19 \u2022 Nebraska Examiner\nOMAHA \u2014 Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a former Nebraska high school teacher and coach, is making a second presidential campaign stop Oct. 19 in Nebraska\u2019s 2nd Congressional District.\n\nWalz visited La Vista the weekend after being named Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 running mate. He hosted a rally that filled a concert venue in suburban Sarpy County with supporters hoping to win a single stray Electoral College vote from the 2nd District.\n\nThe 2nd District is considered up for grabs by many political observers, despite a slight Republican lean. It has split twice in the past four presidential elections, going most recently for President Joe Biden in 2020 and Trump in 2016.\n\nHarris leads most national and local polling in the 2nd District, while former Republican President Donald Trump leads significantly statewide. Both campaigns are knocking on Omaha-area voters\u2019 doors, but Harris and her backers have put more money into local advertising.\n\nNebraska and Maine award a single electoral vote to the winner of the presidential popular vote in each congressional district. The 48 other states award all of their electoral votes to the statewide winner, an approach many call \u201cwinner-take-all.\u201d\n\nWalz\u2019s October rally comes after Republicans in the officially nonpartisan Nebraska Legislature and Gov. Jim Pillen fell short of finding enough votes to switch the state to winner-take-all, despite help from former President Donald Trump and his team.\n\nHis wife, Gwen, hosted a stop Oct. 5, during a swing state and swing district bus tour for reproductive rights, at North Omaha\u2019s campus for Metropolitan Community College.\n\nOhio Sen. J.D. Vance, Trump\u2019s running mate, stopped in Omaha for a fundraiser Aug. 21 and visited with local Republicans at a local sports bar.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign also hosted Iowa Republican U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst on Saturday at a get-out-the-vote event in west Omaha.\n\nThe last time Tim Walz was here, he razzed Vance for not knowing Nebraska. He joked that Vance wouldn\u2019t know what a Runza was and then closed his visit by eating one.\n\nOn substance, Walz argued that Harris is the better choice on reproductive rights, political freedoms, economic opportunity and democratic ideals. He also talked about veterans\u2019 needs and his service in the Nebraska and Minnesota National Guard.\n\nNebraska Democratic Party Chair Jane Kleeb said Nebraska is \u201con the map\u201d to help Harris and Walz in the presidential race. She said she is proud the 2nd District can bring Walz back to his home state again, \u201cthis time to get folks fired up to vote early and vote for a new way forward.\u201d\n\nLiz Huston, a regional spokeswoman for Trump\u2019s campaign, called Walz \u201cout of touch with Nebraskans.\u201d She criticized his stances on immigration enforcement, public safety and climate change.\n\n\u201cTim Walz is dangerously liberal and his record speaks for itself,\u201d she said. \u201cNebraskans want a leader that puts Americans first and that\u2019s why they will overwhelmingly vote for President Trump.\u201d\n\nMore details about the Walz visit will be announced shortly.",

Ron Sachs/CNP / SplashNews.com\n\nHe\u2019s also pulled the spotlight from his intended successor on numerous occasions, including delivering his own comments last week on how the White House is responding to Hurricane Helene \u2014 even after Harris cancelled a Las Vegas campaign event and hurried back to DC to be briefed on the storm\u2019s impact.\n\nThe lame-duck leader has also served up a plethora of cringe-worthy actions that have left Donald Trump-loving conservatives salivating. They include sporting a \u201cTrump 2024\u201d cap during a 9/11 anniversary event last month, and praising Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis Tuesday for how he\u2019s prepped the Sunshine State to handle Hurricane Milton \u2014 one day after Harris complained that DeSantis didn\u2019t take her call.\n\nMeanwhile, there\u2019s been growing tension in recent months between Biden\u2019s advisors and Harris\u2019 over her dueling interest of remaining loyal to the unpopular president while also promoting herself on the campaign trail as representing change, according to multiple reports.\n\n\u201cBiden is intentionally enacting revenge on Kamala for knifing him in the back,\u201d claimed Jason Meister, a Republican political strategist who sits on the advisory board for Trump\u2019s campaign.\n\n\u201cHe never liked her.

AP\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he would have won [a second term], but in his views, and those of his family, they probably think that they were robbed of it,\u201d he added.\n\nTrump campaign spokesperson Caroline Sunshine said \u201cHarris doesn\u2019t need help sabotaging her campaign because she does that herself every time she speaks without a teleprompter, [but] it\u2019s important to remember there is absolutely no daylight between President Biden and Kamala Harris on policy.\u201d\n\n\u201cKamala Harris has said herself she wouldn\u2019t do a single thing differently these last four years, and our campaign will be reminding voters of this fact every day between now and Nov. 5,\u201d Sunshine said.\n\n6 \u201cHe never liked her.

And Harris also led in a new ABC News/Ipsos poll by two points (50% to 48%) among likely voters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Harris and Trump were tied in the latest NBC News survey (48% to 48%) among registered voters, with the former president erasing a five-point lead for the vice president last month.\n\nWhat do these results say about where the race is headed?\n\nThe economy remains key\n\nOne constant in the presidential race is the importance of economic issues in voters' minds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the unemployment rate is significantly lower than four years ago, inflation has been a recurring issue for Americans.\n\nThe economy has consistently been one of Trump's strongest issues. Had President Joe Biden remained the Democratic nominee, the former president's advantage on the issue might have been too much for Biden to overcome in states like Arizona and Nevada.\n\nBut after Biden stepped aside as the presumptive nominee in July, Harris' entry into the race upended the election and allowed Democrats to reframe their economic message independent of the president.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn several swing-state polls, Harris has had some success in pulling closer to Trump on the economy.\n\nHowever, the three polls showed that Trump retained an economic advantage.\n\nIn the NBC poll, Trump had an eleven-point lead over Harris (50% to 39%) on which candidate would best handle inflation and cost of living issues.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, respondents in the ABC poll gave Trump an eight-point edge on the economy (46% to 38%) and a seven-point lead on tackling inflation (44% to 37%). However, in the ABC poll, Harris had a five-point advantage (42% to 37%) over Trump regarding which candidate would look out for middle-class Americans.\n\nIn the CBS poll, though, 67% of respondents said that prices on items they purchase have increased in recent months, while only 6% said that prices have declined. But Trump has zeroed in on this issue throughout his campaign.\n\nBoth candidates \u2014 especially Harris \u2014 will continue emphasizing economic matters in the weeks ahead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWho's the change candidate?\n\nDespite having already served as president, Trump is running as a change candidate \u2014 touting conservative stances that would be a stark reversal from those of the Biden administration on issues ranging from immigration to judicial appointments.\n\nRelated stories\n\nHarris is also running as a change candidate. She's been more forceful than Biden in articulating her views on issues like reproductive rights and border security.\n\nOn most issues, Trump has sought to tie Harris to Biden at every turn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut so far, she has retained an edge \u2014 albeit narrow \u2014 on which candidate would represent change.\n\nIn the NBC News poll, Harris had a five-point lead over Trump on which candidate represented change (45% to 40%). The figure marks a small decline from her nine-point edge in September (47% to 38%).\n\nWith many voters seeking a candidate who'll shake things up from the Biden years, it's significant that Harris retains an advantage on the issue even though her overall lead in the NBC poll slipped. For many voters \u2014 especially young voters concerned over the economy and the conflict in Gaza \u2014 the \"change\" factor remains critical.",

She made her medical information public on Saturday in an effort to draw attention to his refusal to do so, according to a Harris aide.\n\nHarris said Trump\u2019s reluctance to provide a detailed medical reports is the latest example of his lack of transparency.\n\n\u201cI think that it\u2019s obvious that his team, at least, does not want the American people to see everything about who he is,\u201d Harris told reporters before boarding a plane to North Carolina.\n\nTrump has voluntarily released updates from his personal physician, as well as detailed reports from medical doctor Ronny Jackson who treated him after the first assassination attempt, Steven Cheung, Trump Campaign Communications Director, said in a statement\n\n\u201cAll have concluded he is in perfect and excellent health to be Commander in Chief,\u201d Cheung said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Harris campaign is eager to highlight the former president\u2019s age since he became the oldest candidate in the race. President Joe Biden, 81, stepped aside as the Democratic standard bearer following a poor debate performance against Trump.\n\nLocked in a tight race. Harris\u2019 campaign hopes that contrasting her comparative youth and mental acuity with Trump\u2019s more advanced age and tendency to meander, along with the differences in transparency between the two, will help convince undecided voters that she is more fit for office.\n\nA White House doctor said in 2018 when Trump was in office that he was in overall excellent health then but needed to shed weight and start a daily exercise routine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSimmons said Harris\u2019s allergies had been well-managed with over-the-counter and prescription medications.\n\nHer urticaria or hives were \u201csporadic and transient and do not seem to be triggered by any particular exposure nor are they associated with other symptoms\u201d and respond well to antihistamine treatment.\n\nHarris has been on allergen immunotherapy for the last three years, dramatically improving her allergy and urticaria symptoms and negating her need for medication other than occasional nasal spray, he said.\n\nHarris wears contact lenses. Her family history includes her mother\u2019s colon cancer. Harris was up to date on preventative health procedures including colonoscopy and annual mammograms, he said.",

        "text": "Harris losing ground to Trump in US presidential election, polls suggest\nDemocratic and Republican nominees locked in dead heat with less than a month until vote, according to new polling.\n\nKamala Harris is losing ground to Donald Trump with less than a month to go until the election for president of the United States, a series of polls suggest.\n\nHarris\u2019s lead over Trump has narrowed or vanished outright as the race for the White House approaches the final stretch, according to three polls released on Sunday.\n\nIn the latest NBC News poll, the Democratic and Republican nominees are tied nationally at 48 percent ahead of the November 5 vote, a turnaround from a five-point lead for Harris in the same survey last month.\n\nIn the latest ABC News/Ipsos poll, Harris leads 50 percent to 48 percent among likely voters. The Democrat led 52 percent to 46 percent in the same poll last month.\n\nThe latest CBS News/YouGov poll shows Harris up 51 percent to 48 percent among likely voters, compared with a four-point advantage last month.\n\nFollowing the latest figures, Harris holds a 1.4 percent point lead in Real Clear Polling\u2019s aggregate of major polls, slipping from 2.2 percent on Saturday.\n\nThe tightening poll numbers come amid concerns among Democrats that Harris is failing to shore up support among Hispanics and African Americans, two of the party\u2019s key constituencies.\n\nWhile Harris is leading among women of all races, she has struggled to drum up enthusiasm among men, including African Americans and Hispanics, who have increasingly gravitated towards Trump in recent years.\n\nIn The New York Times/Siena College polls released on Saturday and Sunday, Harris attracted the support of 78 percent of Black voters and 56 percent of Hispanic voters \u2013 significantly lower shares than won by the Democratic nominees in the 2020 and 2016 elections.\n\nOn Thursday, former President Barack Obama admonished Black men for not showing as much enthusiasm for Harris\u2019s candidacy as he had received during his campaigns in 2008 and 2012.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re coming up with all kinds of reasons and excuses, I\u2019ve got a problem with that,\u201d Obama said at a campaign event in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, one of seven key battleground states expected to decide the election.\n\n\u201cBecause part of it makes me think \u2013 and I\u2019m speaking to men directly \u2013 part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren\u2019t feeling the idea of having a woman as president, and you\u2019re coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that.\u201d\n\nHarris and Trump on Sunday continued to focus their campaigns on the battleground states, holding events in North Carolina and Arizona, respectively.\n\nAt a campaign rally in Greenville, North Carolina, Harris took aim at Trump for spreading misinformation about the government\u2019s response to recent hurricanes.\n\n\u201cThe problem with this, beyond the obvious, is it\u2019s making it harder, then, to get people life-saving information if they\u2019re led to believe they cannot trust,\u201d Harris said.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s the pain of it all, which is the idea that those who are in need have somehow been convinced that the forces are working against them in a way that they would not seek aid.\u201d\n\nTrump, meanwhile, used a rally in Prescott Valley, Arizona to call for the hiring of 10,000 additional Border Patrol agents.\n\n\u201cAfter I win, I will be asking Congress immediately to approve a 10 percent raise \u2013 they haven\u2019t had one in a long time \u2013 for all agents and a $10,000 each retention and signing bonus,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to retain them.\u201d",

        "text": "In Guam and other U.S. territories, citizens lose some voting rights\nVotebeat is a nonprofit news organization reporting on voting access and election administration across the U.S.\n\nThis news analysis was originally distributed in Votebeat\u2019s free weekly newsletter. Sign up to get future editions, including the latest reporting from Votebeat bureaus and curated news from other publications, delivered to your inbox every Saturday.\n\nA couple of weeks ago I got a fascinating email from a reader: She had moved from Hawaii to Guam, and had discovered she and her husband will not be able to cast ballots for president this November.\n\nBecause they\u2019d established residency in Guam, they were also not able to cast absentee ballots in Hawaii (or in Washington, where they are originally from and still own property). Her husband had moved from active-duty military to a civilian job working for the military, so she was no longer protected by federal laws that help service members and their families vote or that lend specific help to those living abroad.\n\nSince Guam is a U.S. territory, they aren\u2019t living \u201cabroad\u201d at all. They now fall into the squishy category that the millions of Americans in these territories fall into: They are U.S. citizens whose voting rights are significantly different (read: less) than any voter living in the 50 states. While the territories each elect a nonvoting member of the House of Representatives, they have no representation in the Senate. And while they hold presidential primaries, based on party rules, they have no representation in the Electoral College. Their votes for the federal offices are, more or less, seen as symbolic.\n\nIt\u2019s notable that at a time when the voting discourse is currently dominated by the nonexistent problem of noncitizens voting, there\u2019s much less interest in the problem of citizens who are denied the right to vote.\n\nKaren Ziemer, the new Guam resident we heard from, said she realizes her problem is not unique. She\u2019s offended on behalf of the people of her new home. One out of every eight Guam residents has served in the military \u2014 the highest rate anywhere in the United States, territory or otherwise. (The military owns about a third of the territory.) And yet veterans on Guam, who make up a significant portion of the island\u2019s 175,000 people, can\u2019t cast ballots in federal elections.\n\n\u201cYou would think that if anyone had the desire, even the right, to vote for commander in chief, it would be people who live on Guam,\u201d Ziemer said. \u201cAnd they can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThe situation strikes Ziemer as surreal. While her husband is no longer on active duty, he still works for the military, and many of their friends there are military-affiliated and cast absentee ballots elsewhere with the help of the federal government. A few days ago, she said, she went to a wine tasting with a group of active-duty spouses, \u201cand I was sitting there thinking \u2018They can all vote, and I can\u2019t.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn 2020, several former Hawaii residents who had relocated to Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico and American Samoa filed a lawsuit, arguing they had been \u201cdisenfranchised and relegated to a status as second-class citizens in ways they would not have been had they moved to anywhere else on Earth.\u201d They took issue with both the federal law governing overseas voting, and a specific law in Hawaii that dictates how such ballots are handled there.\n\n\u201cIndeed, even if they resided in Antarctica \u2014 or left Earth entirely to work at the International Space Station \u2014 they would still be permitted to vote for President and voting members of Congress in federal elections,\u201d their complaint read.\n\nThe 9th U.S. Circuit Court, which heard oral arguments this year, didn\u2019t buy it, upholding a lower court\u2019s ruling.\n\nFederal laws that govern how U.S. citizens abroad can vote do discriminate based on where those former residents move, the court ruled, but there are aspects of the relationship between the United States and the relevant territories that \u201cconceivably justify\u201d the differing treatment. Hawaii could reasonably conclude, they write, that allowing people who do not live there or plan to return to vote absentee would unfairly dilute the votes of its own residents.\n\nIn the same way Ziemer was surprised by the sudden loss of her federal voting rights, it is probably surprising to many of you that there are millions of U.S. citizens living in these territories whose voting rights in presidential races are reduced to what are essentially straw polls. But it highlights something that we\u2019ve talked about before in this newsletter and in our coverage: The Constitution does not explicitly guarantee a right to vote.\n\nAs Neil Weare \u2014 a civil rights attorney with special focus on the U.S. territories \u2014 wrote in a recent law review article, the unequal treatment of Americans in these areas \u201cis admittedly part of the constitutional structure established at our nation\u2019s founding.\u201d\n\nThis has been controversial since, essentially, the time the Constitution was written. Every few years the issue flares up again: John Oliver did a segment on it in 2015, and in 2016 Sen. Elizabeth Warren held some hearings about it. Presidential candidates are often asked about it, and former presidents Obama and Trump expressed some support for changing it.\n\n\u201cIt seems as though a legislative fix should be in order,\u201d Ziemer says.\n\nBut, she adds, \u201cit affects so few people I doubt very much it is on anyone\u2019s list of priorities. And, bonus, because I am here, I do not even have a legislative representative who could help!\u201d\n\nJessica Huseman is Votebeat\u2019s editorial director and is based in Dallas.

The election\u2019s outcome will influence US-India relations in critical areas, such as trade, defense cooperation, immigration, and climate collaboration, making it essential for India to carefully navigate the changes that may arise.\n\nIndia-US trade and investment: Contrasting approaches\n\nBilateral trade between India and the US remains a cornerstone of the economic relationship, with the two countries exchanging US$118.28 billion worth of goods and services in FY 2023-24. The US is a leading investor in India, particularly in sectors such as technology, infrastructure, renewable energy, and manufacturing. The post-election economic policies of the next US president will have a direct bearing on India\u2019s exports, investment flows, and overall economic growth.\n\nKamala Harris, if elected, is expected to carry forward many of the trade policies established under the Biden administration, which have emphasized economic resilience, domestic manufacturing, and reducing reliance on global supply chains. While these policies have contributed to the US\u2019s economic recovery, they have posed challenges for countries like India that rely heavily on exports to the US. Harris, however, is known for her strong ties to India\u2014her mother was Indian-born\u2014and may seek to strengthen economic relations by finding a balance between supporting domestic industries and fostering global trade.\n\nHarris\u2019s administration would likely continue discussions within the US-India Trade Policy Forum, which has aimed to resolve trade disputes, increase market access, and foster deeper collaboration in emerging sectors like technology and clean energy. However, India could still face trade barriers if the Democratic administration continues prioritizing domestic manufacturing through acts like the Inflation Reduction Act, which provides subsidies to American manufacturers.\n\nDonald Trump, on the other hand, has historically favored protectionist trade policies, focusing on America-first principles. During his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on various goods, including Indian exports, which led to trade tensions between the two nations.\n\nIn a speech delivered on October 10, 2024, the former US president announced plans to introduce a reciprocal tax against India if re-elected, criticizing the country for its high tariffs. Trump referred to India as the \u201cbiggest charger\u201d of tariffs, alongside China and Brazil, and reiterated complaints from American businesses like Harley-Davidson, which struggled with India\u2019s 150 percent tariffs. Despite acknowledging a positive relationship with India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Trump argued that US trade policies have been too lenient, contributing to America being \u201cover-exploited\u201d by countries with higher tariffs.\n\nIndia\u2019s average tariff rates have increased, reaching 18.1 percent in 2022. The US is among India\u2019s largest trade partners, with bilateral trade close to US$120 billion in FY24 (enjoying a trade surplus of US$36.74 billion). Indian policymakers defend their tariffs as necessary to protect and boost domestic manufacturing, drawing parallels to US policies like the Inflation Reduction Act and Chips Act. External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar noted that globalization has led to job losses, linking this to growing dissatisfaction in many societies.\n\nTrump\u2019s remarks come amid broader global concerns over Chinese imports, especially in the clean energy and high-tech sectors, sparking protective measures in the US and Europe. Indian steelmakers have also raised concerns over surging Chinese steel imports, calling for anti-dumping duties.\n\nIf Trump returns to the White House, India might face renewed challenges in exporting products like textiles, pharmaceuticals, and agricultural goods to the US market, as he may revive his tariff-focused trade strategy.\n\nOn the other hand, Trump has been known to favor bilateral trade deals over multilateral agreements, and a second Trump administration might explore the possibility of negotiating a US-India trade agreement. This could open new opportunities for India to expand its exports, though such negotiations would likely be tough and require India to make concessions in key sectors.\n\nGeopolitics and foreign policy: Strengthening strategic ties\n\nIn the geopolitical arena, both Harris and Trump are expected to maintain a strong focus on the Indo-Pacific region, where India plays a critical role as a counterbalance to China\u2019s influence. The US-India strategic partnership, particularly within the framework of the Quad alliance (India, US, Japan, and Australia), is likely to remain robust under either administration, as both Democrats and Republicans view India as a key ally in countering China\u2019s rise.\n\nKamala Harris, if elected, would continue the Biden administration\u2019s commitment to the Quad and may seek to deepen defense cooperation with India. Under Biden, the US and India have expanded their joint military exercises, defense sales, and technology transfers, solidifying India\u2019s role in the Indo-Pacific strategy. Harris is expected to maintain this trajectory, focusing on areas like cyber defense, artificial intelligence, and space collaboration via forums like the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) and Quad.\n\nGiven her personal connection to India, Harris may also push for more people-to-people ties and educational exchanges between the two countries, further strengthening diplomatic relations. Additionally, Harris\u2019s administration is likely to emphasize democratic values and human rights in its foreign policy, which could align well with India\u2019s position as a leading democracy in the region.\n\nDonald Trump, in contrast, is known for his transactional approach to foreign policy, often prioritizing immediate US interests over long-term strategic alliances. While Trump\u2019s first term saw a significant focus on China as a geopolitical rival, his approach to India was less consistent. A second Trump presidency could lead to a more unpredictable foreign policy, where defense and security cooperation with India may continue, but economic tensions could increase if Trump adopts a more confrontational and protectionist stance on trade.\n\nHowever, Trump\u2019s tough stance on China may benefit India\u2019s strategic goals, as the US would likely ramp up its efforts to counter China\u2019s influence in the Indo-Pacific. This could result in increased defense collaboration, including more defense sales and joint exercises. At the same time, Trump\u2019s focus on a more aggressive foreign policy could also put pressure on India to align more closely with US positions on China, which might complicate India\u2019s efforts to maintain its strategic autonomy.\n\nImmigration and IT sector: Workforce mobility at stake\n\nIndia\u2019s IT industry, which earned more than US$194 billion in export revenue in FY 2022-23 and US$199 billion in FY24, relies heavily on access to the US market and the mobility of its workforce. The H-1B visa program, which allows skilled professionals to work in the US, is particularly important for Indian IT firms, as thousands of Indian workers are employed by American tech companies.\n\nKamala Harris, with her background as a California senator, is likely to support policies that make it easier for high-skilled immigrants to work in the US. Harris has long been a proponent of comprehensive immigration reform, which includes provisions to expand visa availability for skilled workers. This would be a positive development for India\u2019s IT sector, as a Harris administration could offer greater stability and flexibility for Indian professionals seeking employment in the US. Additionally, Harris has voiced support for expanding STEM education and workforce development, which could benefit Indian tech companies working in collaboration with US firms.\n\nDonald Trump, in contrast, has a history of taking a hardline approach to immigration. During his first term, Trump introduced restrictions on H-1B visas, making it more difficult for Indian IT professionals to work in the US. A second Trump administration could bring tighter controls on skilled immigration, including further cuts to H-1B visas, which would negatively impact Indian IT firms and reduce opportunities for Indian professionals to work in the US. This could force Indian companies to look for alternative markets or explore remote work options to maintain their competitive edge.\n\nALSO READ: India\u2019s Global Capability Centers Market Estimated to Reach US$110 Billion by 2030\n\nClimate change and green energy: Collaboration opportunities\n\nIndia\u2019s renewable energy transition is well underway, with ambitious targets to expand solar, wind, and other green energy sources. The US has been a key partner in this effort, particularly under the Biden administration, which has made climate change a top priority. India has benefited from US technological and financial support in its renewable energy projects, and this collaboration is expected to continue depending on the election outcome.\n\nKamala Harris, if elected, is likely to prioritize climate action and continue the Biden administration\u2019s policies on clean energy and sustainability. This could include further collaboration with India on green technologies, electric vehicles, and climate finance. Harris\u2019s commitment to addressing global climate challenges would align with India\u2019s goals of expanding its renewable energy capacity, and joint US-India initiatives in this area could gain momentum.\n\nDonald Trump, however, has historically been skeptical of climate change initiatives and withdrew the US from the Paris Climate Agreement during his first term. A second Trump presidency might reduce US involvement in global climate efforts, which could hinder some of the progress made in US-India green energy cooperation. This could affect India\u2019s access to US technology and funding in the clean energy sector, potentially slowing down its renewable energy expansion plans.\n\nALSO READ: India-U.S. Boost Clean Energy Ties: Collaboration on Hydrogen, Sustainable Aviation\n\nConclusion: Navigating an uncertain future\n\nAs the 2024 US presidential election approaches, India faces a critical moment in its economic and strategic relationship with the United States. Whether it is navigating shifting trade policies, managing workforce mobility, or collaborating on climate initiatives, the next US president will play a crucial role in shaping India\u2019s global outlook.\n\nKamala Harris, if elected, is expected to bring continuity in many areas of cooperation, with a focus on strengthening economic, defense, and climate ties with India. Her personal connection to India and her balanced approach to global trade could provide opportunities for deeper collaboration.\n\nDonald Trump, if victorious, may introduce a more protectionist and transactional approach to US-India relations, particularly in trade and immigration. While defense cooperation could remain strong, Trump\u2019s focus on domestic priorities may create new challenges for India in the economic and technological spheres.\n\nFor India, staying agile and proactive in its engagement with the next US administration will be essential to securing its long-term economic and strategic interests. The outcome of the 2024 election will shape the future of India-US relations in profound ways, making it imperative for Indian businesses and policymakers to closely monitor and adapt to the evolving geopolitical landscape.",

Sued for it. When he took out a full-page ad in the New York Times against those five teenagers, Black and Latino, who were innocent, saying they should be executed. The Central Park Five. When you look at \u2013 the first black president of the United States and he had birther lies,\u201d Harris added.\n\nShe continued, \u201cAnd now you look at Black immigrants, legal immigrants, in Springfield, Ohio, and he gets on a debate stage, and says they\u2019re eating their pets. Come on. This man is dangerous.\u201d\n\nHarris went on to question Trump\u2019s fitness for office and accused his staff of shielding him from scrutiny, seizing on his decision to forego a second debate, or sit for an interview with 60 Minutes.\n\n\u201cEvery president for the last half century has done one, anyone who is running for president. Everyone has done it, except Donald Trump. He will not debate me again. I\u2019ve put out my medical records, he won\u2019t put out his medical records. And you have to ask, why is his staff doing that? And it may be because they think he\u2019s just not ready, and unfit, and unstable, and should not have that level of transparency for the American people. There\u2019s a real choice in this election,\u201d Harris said.\n\nThe vice president was also asked about the contest for battleground North Carolina, where she sat for the interview, and potential threats to voting rights, particularly for Black Americans.\n\n\u201cWell and so you know, I think that we should all, whoever is in North Carolina watching this, Josh Stein running for governor, it\u2019s going to be very important \u2013 pay attention to those state House races, because if they can change the balance in the state House, then they will be able to push through more protections for voting rights,\u201d Harris responded.\n\nHarris went on to criticize attempts to restrict voting expansions that took place during the pandemic.",

The Democratic presidential candidate is highlighting the age difference with the election just three weeks away . Harris' camp released a detailed report on Saturday concluding that the candidate is in \u201cexcellent health\u201d",
        "text": "U.S. Presidential Election 2024: Kamala Harris attacks Donald Trump on his age\n\u201cIf former President Donald Trump wins the election, at 78, he would surpass President Joe Biden and become the oldest U.S. president to take office \u2014 by just a few months.\u201d Meanwhile, Vice President Kamala Harris will celebrate her 60th birthday in a few days, on October 20. With the election just three weeks away, the Democratic presidential candidate is highlighting the age difference.\n\nDoubts surrounding Trump's health\n\nImages of Trump raising a clenched fist to the crowd after surviving an assassination attempt in July made an impression, showing a robust man despite the circumstances and passage of time. But is this really the case? In recent months, the former president has made numerous blunders and factual errors. Last month, in an interview with Fox News, he referred to the audience present during a televised debate with Harris when there was no audience. Later, he proudly posted on social media about a \u201cgreat day spent in Louisiana\u201d\u2026 when he was actually in Georgia.\n\nSuch confusions have led to mockery of Biden, who turns 82 November 20, though Trump has largely been spared from similar ridicule. However, a recent New York Times analysis pointed out several signs of Trump\u2019s aging: more frequent digressions, leading to longer speeches (82 minutes on average compared to 45 minutes in 2016), and more frequent use of terms like \u201calways\u201d or \u201cnever,\u201d considered by some experts as signs of advanced age, according to the East Coast newspaper.\n\nAccusations from Harris' camp\n\nAccording to Harris, Trump is hiding things from voters. \u201cIt is clear to me that he and his team do not want the American people to really see what it is that he is doing and whether or not he actually is fit to do the job of being president of the United States,\u201d the Democratic candidate said October 12. \u201cHe is quite unfit to do the job,\u201d she added before flying to North Carolina, a key battleground state recently hit by Hurricane Helen.\n\nAt the heart of the controversy is Trump\u2019s broken promise to undergo medical exams and release full health reports. \u201cOn August 20, Donald Trump told (CBS political correspondent Caitlin Huey-Burns) he would 'very gladly' release his medical records. He hasn\u2019t,\u201d said Democratic campaign spokesperson Ian Sams on X (formerly Twitter), before adding: \u201cWhat's he hiding?\u201d The American public had to settle for a letter from Trump\u2019s personal doctor in September 2023, stating that the results of his physical exams were normal and that his cognitive test results were \u201cexceptional.\u201d Meanwhile, on Saturday, Harris' team released a detailed report concluding that the candidate is in \u201cexcellent health\u201d and has the \u201cthe physical and mental resiliency required to successfully execute the duties of the presidency.\u201d\n\nAmericans\u2019 relative indifference\n\nWill these attacks land? They appear less effective than those launched earlier this year against Biden. According to a Gallup poll, 41% of voters think Trump is too old to be president, compared to 37% in June, before Kamala Harris entered the race. Before the summer, more than two-thirds of Americans believed that the current White House occupant was too old to lead the country.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Trump, with his undeniable physical presence, maintains a busy schedule of travel and rallies. Despite his digressions and confusions, he shows no visible signs of fatigue comparable to those often evident in Biden\u2019s gait, facial expressions, and speech. The 45th president continues to speak publicly at length, sometimes despite the heat, as seen recently in Arizona. Ultimately, it will be up to the American people to decide whether it\u2019s time for him to retire.",

        "text": "US presidential election: What is the electoral college and how does it work?\nWhile the race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris is still too close to call according to the latest polls, the most popular US presidential candidate can still end up losing the election anyway. Here's why.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhether it's former president Donald Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris, the most popular US presidential candidate could actually end up losing.\n\nUnlike many other countries, presidential elections in the US are not decided by the overall popular vote.\n\nInstead, the votes of individual states determine the outcome via a controversial, winner-takes-all system: the Electoral College.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nThe Electoral College is a group of people \u2014 electors \u2014 who collectively represent each of the 50 states. It is they, not the voters, who technically elect the president.\n\nIn total, there are 538 electors, corresponding to the number of US representatives (435) plus the number of US Senators (100) plus three additional electors for Washington, DC.\n\nEach state is assigned a number of electors based on the size of its Congressional delegation, which in turn is allocated by population. California, for example, has 54, while Wyoming has three.\n\nWhile electors are technically able to vote as they wish, they overwhelmingly back whichever candidate wins the most votes in their state.\n\nThat means whoever wins the popular vote in California will almost certainly get 54 electoral college votes to add to his or her tally.\n\nSwing states\n\nThere are only two main political parties in the US: the centre-left Democratic Party and the conservative Republican Party.\n\nMost states consistently vote one way or the other, and many of them by reliably hefty margins. This leaves just a handful of swing states where the vote can go either way. Candidates tend to focus the majority of their campaigning on these key areas.\n\nThere are typically just six or seven swing states in any given election year. This time around, the most frequently mentioned are Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada, Arizona, and Georgia. In 2020, Biden won these states by a slim margin.\n\nHowever, since Harris became the Democratic candidate, polls have shown she may be in with a fighting chance of winning North Carolina and even electoral vote behemoth Florida \u2014 both of which previously voted for Barack Obama.\n\nWhat's the controversy?\n\nThe electoral college gives \"small states much more power in selecting the president than their population warrants compared to large states,\" David Redlawsk, a professor of political science at the University of Delaware, told Euronews during the last election.\n\nFor instance, while California has 54 electoral votes to Wyoming's three, the population of the former is roughly 67 times that of the latter.\n\nAdditionally, all but two states award electoral votes in a \"winner-takes-all\" format, which means that \"anybody who votes for the candidate who doesn't win the state is essentially unrepresented,\" said Redlawsk.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThat's why a candidate can win the popular vote but lose the election, something that occurred in 2000 when George W Bush received 271 electoral votes even as Al Gore got 500,000 more votes nationally.\n\nHad the US Supreme Court decided differently in the notorious Bush v Gore case pertaining to the count in Florida, that state might have gone Gore's way, thus reversing the outcome of the election.\n\nAnd in 2016, Donald Trump triumphed with 304 electoral votes while Hillary Clinton won nearly three million more votes than him nationwide. His victory effectively rested on 100,000 votes spread across three states: Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania.\n\nThese outcomes explain why the Republican Party has elected three presidents since the start of the 21st Century despite having won the national popular vote once since 1988, in 2004.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHow did the electoral college system come about?\n\nWhen the US founders assembled the country's Constitution in 1787, they paid particular attention to the selection of the president and vice president.\n\nHaving fought and won a war of independence from the British monarchy, they were acutely concerned that the executive could end up with too much power.\n\nHistorians say that the founders were also distrustful of direct democracy and concerned about how to balance the interests of the individual states.\n\n\"Some people wanted Congress to select the president. Others wanted it to be independent of Congress,\" said Redlawsk in 2020.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"The Constitutional Convention was near the end, the delegates were tired. They ultimately came up with a compromise that meant that the states elected the president, not Congress.\"\n\nMany historians also trace the system's roots back to slavery.\n\nA convention compromise allowed Southern states to add three-fifths of their expansive slave population to their total population in order to get more electoral votes and seats in Congress.\n\nThe electoral college was amended after the contested election of 1800, which saw the House of Representatives decide a tie between presidential candidate Thomas Jefferson and vice-presidential candidate Aaron Burr.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe 12th amendment to the constitution, ratified in 1804, built the system that\u2019s used today where electors vote for president and vice president, so multiple candidates cannot win a majority of presidential electoral votes.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t really carefully thought out,\" explained Redlawsk, \"and it was done in a time before there were political parties. So nobody foresaw what would happen with political parties and the electoral college.\"\n\nDespite being unpopular among US voters, however, the system is unlikely to change. For that to happen, Congress would have to amend the Constitution, and two-thirds of both chambers of Congress would have to agree for that to happen.\n\nHowever, there are efforts underway at the state level to change things. Several states have signed an agreement called the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, a deal under which they would default to allocating their electoral votes to the national popular vote winner regardless of the statewide vote.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe compact, whose legality is not fully clear, would only take effect when enough states signed it to make it decisive at the national level. Among the states that have signed it is Minnesota \u2014 currently governed by Harris' running mate, Tim Walz.\n\nA version of this article was first published on 4 November 2020.",

This system, which he created in 1981 with Russian geophysicist Vladimir Keilis-Borok, uses methods originally designed for predicting earthquakes.The system consists of 13 keys, which assess various factors about the incumbent White House party. According to Lichtman, if six of these keys go against the incumbent party, it is predicted to lose the election. Less than six, and the incumbent is predicted to win.In a recent interview with ANI, Lichtman explained that only four of the 13 keys work against the Democrats, which spells defeat for Donald Trump.\"The White House party (Democrats) loses key 1, the mandate key, because they lost US House seats in 2022. They lost key number 3, the incumbency key, because the sitting president's not running. They lose key number 12, the incumbent charisma key, because what you may think of Harris, she's only been a candidate for a little while. She's not reached the status of a Franklin Roosevelt. And she loses key number 11, the foreign policy failure key, because the Middle East is a disaster, a humanitarian crisis with no good end in sight,\" said Lichtman.He added, \"That's four keys down, two keys short of what would be needed to predict Donald Trump returning to the White House and Harris losing.\"Lichtman further elaborated on the nine keys that are working in favor of the Democrats and Kamala Harris.\"Well, as I said, they're only losing four. That means they're winning nine keys. The contest key, because the Democrats united around Harris. The third-party key, because the campaign of RFK Jr. has fizzled. The short-term economic key, because there's no recession in the election year. The long-term economic key, because real per capita growth under the Biden term has vastly exceeded the average of the previous two terms,\" he said.He continued, \"They win the policy change key, because policies under Biden are fundamentally different from those under Trump. They win the social unrest key, because the earlier sporadic demonstrations have fizzled away. They win the scandal key. Republicans have been trying for four years to pit a scandal on Biden and have come up empty.\"On foreign policy, Lichtman credited Biden with stopping Putin's aggression: \"They win the foreign policy success key, because it was Biden and Biden alone who put together the coalition of the West that stopped Putin from conquering Ukraine... They win the challenger charisma key, because whatever you may think of Trump as a showman, he doesn't fit the definition of the key, which is a once-in-a-generation, across-the-board, inspirational candidate.\"Kamala Harris, currently serving as Vice President, is the first woman, first Black, and first Asian American to hold that office. If elected president, she would make history again as the first woman and the first president of mixed Asian and African descent.\"She will be a pathbreaking president, foreshadowing where America is going. We're rapidly becoming a majority-minority country. Old white guys like me are on the decline,\" Lichtman said.If Trump wins the election, it would mark a historic return to the White House, as he would be the first president in over 100 years to serve two non-consecutive terms.However, Lichtman dismissed the possibility of an \"October surprise\" swaying the election results. \"The October surprise is the biggest myth in American history. I've predicted all my elections... well before any October surprise,\" he said, citing the 2016 election when Trump\u2019s recorded comments on women didn't change his prediction of Trump's victory.Lichtman contrasted the leadership styles of Trump and Harris. He described Trump as an \"America first\" leader, against collective security with U.S. allies, while Harris represents a more traditional American approach, favoring cooperation with allies.\"Trump is an America first president or candidate... He believes in turning inward. He's against collective security with our allies. Harris is your typical president who believes in collective security, who believes in working with our allies,\" said Lichtman.As the election approaches, the political scientist stood firm in his prediction: \"The keys predict we're going to have a new pathbreaking president.\"The U.S. presidential election is scheduled for November 5, with Harris poised to make history if Lichtman\u2019s forecast holds true.",

        "text": "L.A. Times electoral endorsements for 2024 November election\nAdvertisement\n\nProposition 2: Yes\n\nProposition 2 is a $10 billion bond that will fund repairs for California\u2019s public schools and community colleges, many of which are run-down and lack basic functionality, such as air conditioning.\n\nProposition 3: Yes\n\nProposition 3 gives Californians an opportunity to formally renounce a wrongful moment in our voting history and step forward to positively affirm that bigotry toward same-sex couples has no place in our state or its Constitution.\n\nProposition 4: Yes\n\nProposition 4 is a $10 billion grab bag of spending on climate, fire prevention, energy, conservation and agriculture projects so disparate that this bond measure almost defies categorization. But it is still better to spend money today to prepare for climate change than to pay much more to respond in the future.\n\nProposition 5: Yes\n\nProposition 5 would get California closer to majority rule by lowering the threshold to pass local bond measures to 55% instead of 66.7%. We think it\u2019s a fairer way to make spending and taxing decisions. Requiring supermajority support gives disproportionate power to the naysayers to decide the appropriate level of taxation and spending. Why should one-third of voters get to set priorities for an entire community?\n\nProposition 6: Yes\n\nProposition 6 will remove the language in the state Constitution that allows prisons to force incarcerated people to work and punish them when they refuse. If we want people to emerge from prison rehabilitated \u2014 and if we care about public safety, we should \u2014 that requires allowing them to access as many opportunities as possible to get an education, learn a skill and get treatment to best prepare them for a productive life.\n\nProposition 32: Yes\n\nProposition 32 would give the state\u2019s lowest-paid workers a modest raise, setting the minimum wage to $18 an hour in January, up from the scheduled $16.50 under current law. Businesses with 25 or fewer workers would have until 2026 to start paying $18 an hour. Earning a decent wage shouldn\u2019t be a privilege afforded to people who happen to work in a city that has a higher local minimum wage, and raising base pay statewide is more equitable than a patchwork of rules for different regions and industries.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProposition 33: No\n\nProposition 33 would repeal a state law that restricts local governments\u2019 ability to expand rent control. But it goes too far by including sweeping language that would prohibit the state from imposing any limits on rent controls set by cities and counties in the future, even if they stymie housing construction.\n\nProposition 34: No\n\nAIDS Healthcare Foundation calls this a \u201crevenge initiative,\u201d and we agree. Proposition 34 would change the rules for healthcare providers in ways that seem designed to cut off the foundation\u2019s tenant advocacy. Voters should emphatically reject Proposition 34 and send the message that they will not tolerate such a weaponization of the state\u2019s citizen initiative process.\n\nProposition 35: No\n\nProposition 35 involves a tax on managed-care organizations, Medi-Cal reimbursement rates for medical providers, federal healthcare funding and the state budget. It\u2019s complicated policymaking that is better suited to the full-time Legislature.\n\nProposition 36: No\n\nProposition 36 won\u2019t end homelessness or crime waves. Existing laws already give police the tools to stop petty thieves and smash-and-grab robbers. Proposition 36 will only refill prisons, push more people to the streets and erase criminal justice reform progress. And it would suck up much of the funding Californians recently approved for mental health care and gut programs that have successfully slashed recidivism.",

        "text": "Trump sparks outrage after calling for army to handle enemies on election day\nDonald Trump has provoked an angry backlash from Democrats after calling for the US armed forces to be turned against his political adversaries when voters go to the polls at next month\u2019s presidential election.\n\nIn comments that further fuelled fears of an authoritarian crackdown if he recaptures the White House, the Republican nominee said the military or national guard should be deployed against opponents that he called \u201cthe enemy within\u201d when the election takes place on 5 November.\n\nHe singled out the California congressman, Adam Schiff, who was the lead prosecutor in the ex-president\u2019s first impeachment trial, as posing a bigger threat to a free and fair election than foreign terrorists or illegal immigrants, his usual prime target for abuse.\n\nTrump\u2019s comments, to Fox News in response to a question on possible election \u201cchaos\u201d, triggered an angry reaction from Kamala Harris\u2019s campaign, which likened them to previous remarks that he would be a dictator \u201con day one\u201d of a second presidency and his suggestions that the US constitution should be terminated to overturn the 2020 election result, which he falsely claims was stolen by Joe Biden.\n\nTrump and the vice-president are locked in a tight contest as election day looms. Most national polls put Harris narrowly ahead, but in the crucial swing states which will decide the election, the contest appears much tighter and offers Trump numerous paths to a potential victory.\n\nAfter initially saying election chaos would not come from his side, Trump launched a vituperative attack on his opponents when the interviewer, Maria Bartiromo, raised the possibility of outside agitators or immigrants who had committed crimes.\n\n\u201cI think the bigger problem are the people from within. We have some very bad people. We have some sick people,\u201d he said on Fox\u2019s Sunday Morning Futures programme.\n\n\u201cIt should be very easily handled by, if necessary, by the national guard, or if really necessary, by the military, because they can\u2019t let that happen.\u201d\n\nAt a rally in Pennsylvania on Monday night, Harris slammed Donald Trump for his comments and showed a clip of the former president making the remarks.\n\n\u201cA second Trump term would be a huge risk for America, and dangerous. Donald Trump is increasingly unstable and unhinged,\u201d Harris told the crowd after playing the clip.\n\nRuth Ben-Ghiat, a historian and expert on fascism at New York University, told NBC that Trump was flagging up what he planned to do as president, which she compared to the \u201c\u2018strongman\u2019 ruling templates of Viktor Orb\u00e1n, Narendra Modi and Vladimir Putin, the leaders of Hungary, India and Russia respectively.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s actually rehearsing, in a sense, what he would be doing as head of state, which is what Orb\u00e1n does, Modi is doing, Putin has long done,\u201d she said.\n\nTrump turned his fire on Schiff, who is a candidate for the US Senate in next month\u2019s poll. He said: \u201cThe thing that\u2019s tougher to handle are these lunatics that we have inside, like Adam Schiff.\u201d\n\nIt was his second attack in two days on Schiff, who earned Trump\u2019s enmity when he was the ranking Democrat on the House of Representatives\u2019 intelligence committee during his presidency, when he said there was evidence of collusion between Trump and Russia during the 2016 election. The House later voted, under Republican leadership, to censure Schiff over his comments.\n\nAt a rally in Coachella, California \u2013 a state he has virtually no chance of winning \u2013 on Saturday, Trump mocked Schiff\u2019s physical characteristics and labelled him a bigger threat than foreign adversaries, including the Chinese president, Xi Jinping.\n\n\u201cHe [Xi] is somebody that we can handle,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe worst people are the enemies from within, the sleaze bags, the guy that you\u2019re going to elect to the Senate, shifty Adam Schiff. He\u2019s a major low-life.\u201d\n\nHe claimed, without providing evidence, that Schiff was engaged in mass voter fraud. \u201cThey send millions and million of ballots all over the place,\u201d he said. \u201c[In] California, you don\u2019t have anything like a voting booth. They take ballots and they just send them all over the place. They come back and they say, oh, somebody won by 5m votes.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Stakes \u2014 Presidential Transition Free newsletter We will guide you through the aftermath of the US election and the transition to a Trump presidency Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Those amounts are expected to continue growing as election day nears and more traders are attracted to the platform.\n\nThe bets are structured as so-called binary options \u2014 all-or-nothing wagers priced at up to $1 a contract \u2014 where the winner keeps the dollar and the loser forfeits it. The price ahead of the event fluctuates depending on its perceived likelihood.\n\nContracts betting on a Trump win on Monday changed hands at 54 cents while those backing Harris were priced at 47 cents, widening a narrow gap that had swung between 51 cents and 49 cents for each candidate in the early days after the market went live just over a week ago.\n\nThe ability of Kalshi and others to offer the contracts to US residents stems from an appeals court ruling last week that lifted an emergency stay requested by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the regulator that blocked the platform\u2019s initial application to list elections contracts.\n\nThe watchdog argued that election bets were akin to gaming, and risked damaging the integrity of the democratic process. The court lifted the stay, ruling that the CFTC had not proved harm to the elections. The regulator\u2019s appeal against a lower-court ruling in favour of Kalshi is ongoing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same as in futures markets,\u201d said Steve Sanders, head of marketing and product development for Interactive Brokers, which launched its own events contracts following Kalshi\u2019s court win.\n\n\u201cThere are people hedging against risks and there are speculators taking a view on short-term market moves. Both play an important role,\u201d he added.\n\nGrant Ferguson, a political scientist and longtime follower of prediction markets at Texas Christian University, said: \u201cYou may want more institutional money because while these investors might have their own particular political views, they\u2019ll have studied the outcome and their wagers represent especially informed opinion.\u201d\n\nThe lifting of the ban has in effect freed onshore exchanges to offer the same kind of contracts on US elections already available overseas and on offshore crypto-based platforms.\n\nUK-based bookmaker Betfair had \u00a385mn placed on the winner of the US election, as of Monday. Total US election betting, also including battleground states and majorities for both chambers of Congress, totalled \u00a3136mn, according to its website.\n\nMore than $1.9bn has been staked on the presidential contest on offshore platform Polymarket, whose users wager in cryptocurrency and which does not technically allow US citizens to bet. Big bets on Trump in recent days from one user helped push the former president to 56 per cent and Harris as low as 43 per cent. On Monday, the pair stood at 55 per cent and 45 per cent respectively.\n\nRajiv Sethi, an economist at Barnard College, part of Columbia University, said: \u201cThe closeness of the race has made the volumes on these markets substantially greater \u2014 and also the closeness in individual states. All sorts of combinatorial possibilities exist.\u201d\n\nVolumes are likely to rise 10-fold as polling day draws closer, according to PredictIt, an onshore US site that operates under a 2014 arrangement based on its use in academic research. The platform, which limits users to $850 maximum bets, is separately fighting in court against closure by the CFTC.\n\n\u201cIt also generates interest when well-intentioned but misguided government agencies try to shut this stuff down,\u201d said John Aristotle Phillips, founder of PredictIt. \u201cThese markets are not just valuable and important \u2014 and legal and constitutionally protected in my opinion \u2014 but they\u2019re also a lot of fun. It\u2019s engaging if you have a little skin in the game.\u201d\n\nOne factor affecting different sites\u2019 pricing could be when they are prepared to declare the contest over. Presidential contracts on Kalshi and PredictIt resolve \u2014 that is, pay out winners \u2014 when the electoral college votes are cast or a victor is inaugurated. Polymarket\u2019s are based on when the Associated Press, Fox News and NBC call the contest for the same winning candidate.\n\nPhillips cautioned against expecting a quick resolution to the election \u2014 or the end of swings in the pricing of the contracts.\n\n\u201cIf the past is any guide, these markets may continue to shift after election day,\u201d he added.",

Both parties want their votes\n\ntoggle caption Ash Ponders for NPR\n\nPHOENIX \u2014 Both parties are ramping up their efforts to court Native American voters in the final stretch to Election Day.\n\nThis demographic could swing the election results in several closely divided states like Arizona.\n\nNative Health, an urban Indian health center, has held several voter registration events across the Grand Canyon state in the run-up to the election.\n\n\u201cI always think that the Native vote in Arizona shouldn't be discounted,\u201d said Walter Murillo, CEO of Native Health. \u201cIn such a tight race, I think any marginal or incremental influence that a candidate or issue might have really, really depends on convincing American-Indian voters.\u201d\n\nPresident Biden only won Arizona in 2020 by about 10,000 votes \u2014 less than a 1% margin \u2014 in a state where Native Americans make up 5% of the population.\n\ntoggle caption Ash Ponders for NPR\n\nNative Americans have traditionally voted for Democrats, and the Harris campaign is seeking to ensure that pattern continues in 2024.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe Harris campaign on Oct. 2 launched the Native Americans for Harris-Walz coalition, aiming to mobilize tribal leaders, organizations and voters. The campaign dubbed its operations in Arizona, home to 22 federally recognized tribes, the \u201cmost expansive tribal organizing program ever in the state,\u201d a campaign official told NPR on Oct. 12, speaking on background to discuss sensitive campaign strategy.\n\nThe campaign has already hired over 20 staff members, with plans for more, to focus on the state\u2019s tribal areas. This is the largest Native voter outreach team for a Democratic presidential campaign in the state. Staff dedicated to Native American communities have also been hired in Wisconsin.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee on Monday announced a six-figure ad campaign targeting Native voters \u2014 dubbed the \u201cI will Vote\u201d campaign \u2014 in Arizona, North Carolina, Montana and Alaska, with digital, print, and radio ads with a majority being placed in local and national Native-owned publications. This is their third, and most expensive, Native-focused ad campaign.\n\ntoggle caption Ash Ponders for NPR\n\nVice President Harris on Oct. 8 received an endorsement from the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe in Nevada, the first-ever endorsement from the tribe in a presidential election, with the tribe citing record funding to tribes and Native American federal appointments.\n\nTribal leaders and young people in Nevada and Arizona spoke with Harris and her running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz last week as they rallied in western swing states.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cIt means so much to be back with the Gila River Indian Community,\u201d Harris said, noting that last summer she was the first vice president to visit that tribe, mainly based outside Phoenix. \u201cI strongly believe that the relationship between tribal nations in the United States is sacred \u2014 and that we must honor tribal sovereignty, embrace our trust in treaty obligations and ensure tribal self-determination.\u201d\n\nVoters already making their choices\n\nAt a powwow in Phoenix, tribal members gathered for an evening of dancing, fry bread and sales.\n\nKevin Jackson, a member of White Mountain Apache, has \u201cDemocracy is Indigenous\u201d flags above his jewelry stand. He has already cast his ballot for Harris.\n\ntoggle caption Ash Ponders for NPR\n\n\u201cI think we need someone in there who's going to help out and help us build our infrastructure because right now it's awful,\u201d Jackson said, noting he hopes to attend the inauguration if she is elected.\n\nAcross the park, Charles Quimayousie is making his way through the vendors. A member of the Tohono O\u2019odham tribe, he also hopes Harris wins.\n\n\u201cThat wall just feels too prejudiced to me,\u201d Quimayousie said, referring to Trump\u2019s border wall \u2014 one of the former president\u2019s signature campaign promises to stem migration into the U.S.\n\n\u201cIt's a good thing, but it just turns me away because when they built that, it went right through my reservation, and some of my people are still on that side, so I'm against that all the way,\u201d he said.\n\nBoth said their tribes generally would agree with them \u2014 though there are members who will support Trump.\n\ntoggle caption Ash Ponders for NPR\n\nGerel Nells, who lives in Mesa and is Navajo said that between Harris and Trump he prefers Trump.\n\n\u201cI did like the fact that Trump put aside a plan for the missing and murdered Indigenous women of this nation,\u201d he said. However, he has already turned in his ballot for comedian Dave Chappelle.\n\nGOP hopes to stave off Democratic efforts\n\nTo the east of Phoenix, across the border in Gallup, New Mexico, members of the Navajo Nation pulled in to set up their booths and shop at the Gallup Flea Market, on a sunny Saturday morning.\n\nNavajo Nation, also known as the Dine, is the largest federally recognized tribe both in terms of enrolled members and geographical land. Its territory spans the state borders of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. Organizers are looking beyond state lines for mobilizing Arizona voters.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cI do feel like the Natives kind of brought it over last time to the Democrat side,\u201d said Ina Noggle, who was tending to the Arizona GOP\u2019s table at the market. She's campaigning for Trump in Arizona.\n\ntoggle caption Ash Ponders for NPR\n\n\u201cWe're just out there trying to present the different platforms and what they have been familiar with and explaining to them that the Democrat Party is no longer the party of their grandparents and their parents,\u201d she said. Noggle talks to voters about issues like abortion and energy independence.\n\nNoggle, Halee Dobbins \u2014 the RNC\u2019s communications director \u2014 and others at the event said they were not asking market-goers to vote for a specific candidate \u2014 but rather approached the conversation by talking about values.\n\n\u201cIt makes the conversation more fruitful and more productive, honestly,\u201d Dobbins said. \u201cIf you talk to the Navajos based on their values, that's where you really get people to feel comfortable talking about who are they going to vote for. You don't want to start with \u2018Are you just going to vote for this candidate?\u2019\u201d\n\nShe said the Trump campaign has been meeting with Navajo Nation members at markets, rodeos, parades, and other local events, and Arizona GOP ran an ad on tribal radio to urge voters to \u201cvote Republican.\u201d The campaign didn\u2019t share statistics about how much they\u2019re spending on Native voters overall.\n\ntoggle caption Ash Ponders for NPR\n\nAs a part of their showing at the flea market, the McKinley County GOP drove about a dozen cars waving GOP flags for Trump, and New Mexican Republican candidates by honking their horns. Some people waved and honked back. Others grumbled at them to get out.\n\n\n\nMaking inroads\n\nStill, GOP organizers said they have noticed a change.\n\n\u201cFour years ago it was like, we\u2019d get like so many fingers,\u201d said Pablo Martinez, who is the McKinley County GOP chair and joined Arizona organizers at the market. \u201cBut it's different now. Like people are coming out of their shells and there\u2019s a little more pride.\u201d\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAt the stand, market-goers picked up signs and stickers in support of Trump and Senate GOP candidate Kari Lake. Tribal members walking by assured their support.\n\nDemocrats had their own presence in the market.\n\nBrenda Hoskie, a member of the Navajo Nation and chair of the McKinley County Democratic Party in New Mexico, said she had organized precincts and others to put up mutton stew stands on Election Day and for early voting, which began last week.\n\n\u201cAfter people vote, they can eat and give out signs,\u201d she said.\n\ntoggle caption Ash Ponders for NPR\n\nSince the Navajo Nation stretches across both states, she hopes her efforts will shore up Democratic support among the Navajo in Arizona, as well the San Juan Southern Paiute tribes.\n\n\u201cWe need to win Arizona. So I'm out there making sure that we are not sitting back,\u201d Hoskie said.\n\n",

        "text": "A.R. Rahman bats for Kamala Harris in upcoming U.S. presidential election\nMusic composer and singer A.R. Rahman endorsed U.S. Vice President and Democratic candidate Kamala Harris for the White House, as he led a concert for her. Ms. Harris\u2019s mother, Shyamala Gopalan, a cancer researcher in California, was originally from Chennai (then Madras), from where Mr. Rahman hails.\n\nThe pre-recorded Sunday evening (October 13, 2024) concert was organized by the AAPI Victory Fund, a Super PAC (Political Activity Committee) that is backing Ms. Harris and other Asian American candidates.\n\nMr. Rahman sang various well-known songs, including Jai Ho [Be Victorious] from Slumdog Millionaire and \u2018Singapenney\u2019, which translates to \u2018lioness\u2019 from the Tamil movie called Bigil. He was accompanied by drummer Veeramani and sang duets, including with singer and voice actor Chinmayi Sripada.\n\n\u201cHer [Ms. Harris] interest in focusing on what unites us instead of what divides us is a message that is very important, not just for the United States but for the world,\u201d Mr. Rahman said.\n\n\u201cAs a fellow South Asian, Tamil, person, I\u2019m deeply proud of her commitment to making the world a better place,\u201d he said.\n\nMs. Harris\u2019s mother, Shyamala Gopalan, was Indian and her father is Black, from Jamaica. In her book, The Truths We Hold: An American Journey, Ms. Harris, who was mostly raised by her mother, says Ms. Gopalan and her relatives \u201cinstilled us with pride in our South Asian roots\u201d and that Ms. Harris and her sister, Maya, were raised with \u201ca strong awareness of and appreciation for Indian culture\u201d. She also says her mother knew that, in the U.S., they would be seen as \u201cblack\u201d and therefore raised them to be \u201cconfident, proud black women\u201d.\n\nSpeaking to the National Association of Black Journalists in July 2024, former U.S. President Donald Trump, who is fighting Ms. Harris for the Presidency, had questioned Ms. Harris\u2019s racial identity by suggesting that she had leaned into her Indian identity relatively more, until recently. Ms. Harris had characterized Mr. Trump\u2019s suggestion as an example of \u201cthe same old show: the divisiveness and the disrespect\u201d.\n\nDuring Sunday\u2019s (October 13, 2024) concert, the founder of AAPI, India-born Shekhar Narasimhan, urged participants to get involved in the elections.\n\n\u201cYou have to make a plan to vote. You have to volunteer in this campaign, and you have to donate,\u201d said Shekhar Narasimhan, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s called \u2018tan man dhan\u2019 [body, mind, wealth].\u201d\n\nMr. Narasimhan said that 400,000 Indian America voters in seven \u2018battleground states\u2019 [i.e., Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada, Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina] could become the \u201cmargin of difference\u201d between winning and losing the election, given the victory margins in these states in 2020.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden won six of these states, while Mr. Trump won one, North Carolina, in 2020.",

        "text": "Election updates: Kamala Harris, Donald Trump zero in on Pennsylvania campaign stops\nEditor's note: This page reflects the news from the campaign trail for the 2024 election from Monday, Oct. 14. For the latest news on the presidential election, read USA TODAY's live election updates for Tuesday, Oct. 15.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump hit the campaign trail on Monday, and they both courted one pivotal swing state: Pennsylvania.\n\nTrump participated in a town hall in Oaks, Pennsylvania, Monday evening, located about 25 miles northwest of Philadelphia. On the other side of the state, Harris held a campaign rally in Erie alongside Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa. Former President Bill Clinton also traveled to Georgia, trying to win over voters for Harris in another crucial battleground.\n\nCatch up with the USA TODAY Network's live updates.\n\nHarris criticizes Trump over \u2018enemy from within\u2019 comments\n\nKamala Harris on Monday seized on Donald Trump\u2019s recent comments that the U.S. military should handle the \u201cenemy from within\u201d in one of her most blistering attacks on the former president of the 2024 campaign.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\n\u201cThis is among the reasons I believe so strongly that a second Trump term would be a huge risk for America and dangerous,\u201d Harris alleged at her campaign rally in Erie, Pennsylvania. \u201cDonald Trump is increasingly unstable and unhinged, and he is out for unchecked power.\"\n\nHarris halted her speech while her campaign displayed video footage of Trump on a large screen using the phrase \u201cenemy from within\u201d during past interviews and rallies, including an interview Sunday with Fox News in which Trump called the \u201cenemy from within\u201d more dangerous than adversaries overseas.\n\n\u201cWe have two enemies. We have the outside enemy and we have the enemy from within,\u201d Trump said in the interview. \u201cAnd the enemy from within, in my opinion, is more dangerous than Russia, China and all these counties.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have some sick people, radical left lunatics. And I think, and it should be very easily handled by, if necessary, by National Guard, or if really necessary, by the military,\u201d Trump added.\n\nHarris then picked up her remarks: \u201cYou heard his words \u2013 coming from him,\u201d Harris said. \u201cHe's talking about the enemy within Pennsylvania. He's talking about the enemy within our country, Pennsylvania.\u201d\n\n\u2013Joey Garrison\n\nHarris remarks on Erie's pivotal election role\n\nWhen addressing the crowd during her rally, Kamala Harris said, \"Erie County, you are a pivot county. How you all vote in presidential elections often ends up predicting the national result.\"\n\nShe asked the crowd, \"Are you ready to make your voices heard?\"\n\n\u2013 Kevin Flowers\n\n'Would anybody else like to faint?'\n\nTrump cut his town hall short after at least two supporters suffered medical episodes in a hot and crowded building. But he also called for his aides to play music, mostly \"Ave Maria,\" and he made jokes to the crowd.\n\nTelling supporters that the two people were going to be okay, Trump said: \"Would anybody else like to faint?\"\n\nBefore that, the former president said, \"Personally, I enjoy this \u2013 we lose weight, you know? ... We can do this, lose four or five pounds, it's okay with me.\"\n\n\u2013 David Jackson\n\nOmarosa Manigault Newman endorses Kamala Harris\n\nOmarosa Manigault Newman, a former Trump White House official, endorsed Kamala Harris on Monday.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump squandered the greatest opportunity he had in his life to be a consequential leader, to shape the direction of our nation and bend it toward something positive,\u201d Newman told Variety in an interview published Monday.\n\nNewman appeared on the first season of \"The Apprentice\" and was a longtime Trump ally. However, Newman and the administration publicly severed ties in 2017, and she penned a book the next year that sparked a major legal battle.\n\n\u2013 Marina Pitofsky\n\nTrump hosts friendly town hall in Pennsylvania\n\nTrump participated in an event his campaign called a town hall, moderated by South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem with questions from supporters in the crowd.\n\nAppearing in Oaks, Pennsylvania., near Philadelphia, Trump outlined his views on the economy, inflation, immigration, and foreign policy challenges in a crucial battleground state. He also embraced a pair of gold star parents.\n\nThe former president told supporters: \"You know, (if) we win Pennsylvania, we win the whole thing,\"\n\nHowever, Trump mixed up the election date while promoting early voting. Things will go well \"if everybody gets out and votes on Jan. 5,\" Trump said at one point; Election Day is actually Nov. 5.\n\nThe former president also ended the town hall early after two medical incidents in the crowd.\n\n\u2013 David Jackson\n\nHarris stops at coffee shop to meet with business owners\n\nHarris stopped at Legenderie Records and Coffee House before her Pennsylvania rally to meet with owners Allana and Ishmael Trainor and other Black business owners and leaders.\n\nThe press was escorted out before she held a discussion about her new economic plan, \"Opportunity Agenda for Black men.\" Harris also purchased a Marvin Gaye record.\n\n\u2013 Matthew Rink\n\nTrump confirms Oct. 27 rally in New York's Madison Square Garden\n\nThe Trump campaign made it official Monday: He will tip off a final week of campaigning in New York City. Trump plans to headline an Oct. 27 rally at Madison Square Garden, the venerable arena in the heart of the Big Apple.\n\nTrump claims he can carry New York, despite the state's overwhelming support for Democrats. In its announcement, the campaign said that \"disastrous economic policies are draining the bank accounts of hardworking New Yorkers.\"\n\n\u2013 David Jackson\n\nKamala Harris will sit for first-ever Fox News interview\n\nKamala Harris has agreed to an interview with Fox News, the network announced Monday, in what will be the vice president\u2019s first sit-down interview with Fox.\n\nHarris\u2019 interview with Fox\u2019s chief political anchor, Bret Baier, will take place Wednesday in the battleground state of Pennsylvania and air that night at 6 p.m.\n\nHarris has received criticism for not doing many interviews with traditional news outlets since launching her bid for the White House. She ramped up media appearances in recent weeks, including a \"60 Minutes\" interview that aired last Monday.\n\nThe interview with Fox, known for its conservative-leaning pundits and programming, comes as Harris is trying to court independent and Republicans voters who oppose Donald Trump, the Republican nominee. Harris has also called for another televised debate with Trump, though the former president has said he won't face off against the vice president again.\n\n\u2013 Rachel Barber and Joey Garrison\n\nFox vs CNN town halls: Trump and Harris choose to take part in separate network events\n\nDonald Trump and Kamala Harris have both agreed to attend town halls \u2013 but not the same one. The Republican presidential candidate will take part in a pre-taped televised town hall hosted by Fox News on Tuesday, and focus on \u201cwomen\u2019s issues\u201d as he tries to win back female voters from his Democratic rival.\n\nThe hour-long event, which will not be broadcast live, will feature an all-women audience and cover various issues, including the economy, abortion, immigration, and health care. Fox\u2019s Harris Faulkner will moderate, and the show will air Wednesday at 11 a.m. Eastern.\n\nA week after Trump takes part in the Fox News town hall, Harris will participate in one hosted by CNN.\n\nAfter Trump ruled out joining a CNN presidential debate, the network invited both candidates to participate in separate town hall events later this month. CNN extended the invitations on Thursday, and the Harris campaign quickly accepted. The vice president is set to appear with Anderson Cooper on CNN on Oct. 23, with voters in Pennsylvania. That event will be aired live.\n\n\u2013 Margie Cullen\n\nTruth Social parent company's stock prices pick up steam\n\nAs Election Day approaches, Trump Media & Technology Group's share prices have increased. The price reached a low of $12.15 on September 23, but the Truth Social parent company has seen a spike of nearly 50% in the last week.\n\n\u2013 Marina Pitofsky\n\nBill Clinton hits the campaign trail in Georgia for Kamala Harris\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton on Monday called on pivotal voters in the swing state of Georgia to support Kamala Harris. The former president delivered remarks at a Democratic campaign office in Columbus, Georgia, on Monday.\n\n\u201cUniting people and building, being repairers of the breach, as Isaiah says, those are the things that work,\u201d Clinton said as he spoke to Peach State voters and organizers. \u201cBlaming, dividing, demeaning \u2014 they get you a bunch of votes at election time, but they don\u2019t work.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Marina Pitofsky\n\nHarris unveils initiatives to support entrepreneurs, regulate crypto in outreach to Black men\n\nKamala Harris proposed legalizing marijuana nationally for recreational use and ensuring Black entrepreneurs have access to the cannabis industry as part of an economic agenda aimed at Black men, whose support for the Democratic presidential nominee has shown signs of slipping.\n\nOther proposals in Harris' \"Opportunity Agenda for Black men,\" released Monday, include offering 1 million \"fully forgivable\" loans to Black business owners and new federal regulations for cryptocurrency that look to protect investors in the digital currency.\n\nThe Harris campaign said, if elected, the vice president will \"break down unjust legal barriers that hold Black men and other Americans back by legalizing marijuana nationally, working with Congress to ensure that the safe cultivation, distribution, and possession of recreational marijuana is the law of the land.\"\n\n\u2013 Joey Garrison\n\n2024 election countdown\n\nCandidates across the country are in the final homestretch of the 2024 election.\n\nEarly voting is open in multiple states, voter registration deadlines have passed in several states and it appears that the top of the ticket candidates may have made their final appearance on the national stage together at the vice presidential debate earlier this month.\n\nOf course, all eyes are on former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, who have been campaigning in battleground states in what is looking like a very close election.\n\n\u2212Kinsey Crowley\n\n'I will stand my ground': Election officials are prepared for attempts to 'find' votes\n\nWhen Donald Trump lost Georgia by just under 12,000 votes in 2020, he went to the two people with the most power over the state\u2019s elections \u2014 the governor and the secretary of state \u2014 and asked for help overturning the results.\n\nHe asked Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, to help him \u201cfind 11,780 votes,\u201d but Raffensperger refused. Then he asked Gov. Brian Kemp, another Republican, to order an audit and convene the state legislature so they could hand the state\u2019s electoral votes to him. Kemp also resisted.\n\nHeading into a tight Nov. 5 election, Trump in September claimed without evidence that Democrats are \"cheating,\" laying the groundwork to challenge the results again if he loses. During a debate in June, Trump twice avoided directly answering if he would accept the result's of this year's election, eventually saying he would do so only \"If it\u2019s a fair and legal and good election.\"\n\nBut Trump would be unlikely to find state officials willing to try to block their state's electoral votes from going to Vice President Kamala Harris. Democrats have gained power in major swing states, and the Republicans leading states that Harris could win have given no indication that they would overturn the election. In fact, several explicitly said they won't do so.\n\nRepresentatives of the Republican governors of New Hampshire, Vermont and Virginia \u2212 all states leaning toward Harris in polls \u2212 told USA TODAY they intend to certify the results regardless of the winner. And top election officials in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Wisconsin, and North Carolina also said they wouldn't be swayed.\n\n\u2013 Erin Mansfield and Sarah Wire\n\nTrump and Harris policies: Here's where the candidates stand on the issues\n\nAlthough Kamala Harris and Donald Trump's visions for solving Americans\u2019 largest problems differ, both have pledged to address inflation, lower taxes and support Israel in its war against Hamas. They have also both committed to ending federal taxes on tips.\n\nStill, Harris and Trump have seriously different pitches for the nation. They diverge most on climate change, reproductive rights and gun control.\n\nBefore you cast your ballot, USA TODAY\u2019s voter guide can help you lay out where each candidate stands. Here\u2019s what Trump and Harris have said about major issues, in their own words:\n\nVoters Guide 2024:Where Harris and Trump stand on key issues\n\n\u2013 Rachel Barber\n\nHow long will it take to know who won the 2024 election? What to know about results\n\nElection Day is on Nov. 5, less than a month away. What's not as obvious is when the results of the presidential race will be announced \u2014 and that depends on a variety of factors. Each state handles its elections differently, ranging from weeks-long early voting to strict voter ID laws.\n\nWhat we do know is that both Republicans and Democrats are ramping up for a barrage of legal challenges between now and after the general election. So don't expect Kamala Harris or Donald Trump to claim victory on Election Day.\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2013 Sam Woodward\n\nKeeping up with Election 2024? Sign up for USA TODAY's On Politics newsletter for exclusive analysis.\n\nIs Trump going to release detailed medical records before Election Day?\n\nNo, Trump probably isn't going to produce the kind of detailed medical report that Harris released over the weekend.\n\nThe release, reflecting a physical taken in April, aimed to contrast the Democratic presidential nominee with her opponent, Donald Trump, who would be the oldest person elected to the presidency and who has shared few details about his own health.\n\nTrump and his allies have rejected questions about whether the former president will released the same information. He demanded in a post on Truth Social that Harris also take a test on \"Cognitive Stamina and Agility\"\n\nThe Trump campaign, meanwhile, cited the general reports attesting to the candidate's health put out this year by congressman, doctor and longtime Trump ally Ronny Jackson. A campaign statement said Trump \"has maintained an extremely busy and active campaign schedule unlike any other in political history.\"\n\nAll the same, expect Harris and allies to call for more detailed health records from Trump.\n\n\"Are they afraid that people will see that he is too weak and unstable to lead America?\" Harris said this weekend in North Carolina. \"Is that what\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\n\u2013 David Jackson\n\nDonald Trump takes betting lead over Kamala Harris for first time since debate\n\nDonald Trump took the lead over Kamala Harris in the betting odds for the White House for the first time since the Sept. 10 presidential debate.\n\nTrump's largest lead at the betting houses USA TODAY has regularly surveyed comes at BetOnline where he stands -140 to Harris' +120.\n\nThe action, which U.S. bookmakers cannot legally take part in, held steady through September but has seen Trump come back into favor over the past two weeks.\n\n\u2013 James Powel\n\nVoter registration deadlines are here\n\nThe deadline to register to vote in 2024 has already passed in more than a dozen states, and time is running out in many more places through October.\n\nMillions of Americans have enrolled to cast a ballot this year, with unprecedented recent spikes in new voters posing to shake up a heated race for the White House.\n\nWith Election Day just weeks away, campaigns and nonpartisan organizations are turning their attention to another priority: making sure voters actually show up.\n\n\u2212 Savannah Kuchar\n\nMore:Voter registration deadlines hit, focus shifts to actually getting people to vote\n\nTrump gives thumbs-down to 'The Apprentice' movie\n\nDonald Trump has quickly criticized the new film about his life: \"The Apprentice.\"\n\n\"A FAKE and CLASSLESS Movie written about me,\" Trump said early Monday on Truth Social about the film that USA TODAY described as \"a polarizing biopic of young Donald Trump (Sebastian Stan), portraying him as a New York slumlord who becomes a ruthless real-estate mogul under the tutelage of closeted gay lawyer Roy Cohn (Jeremy Strong).\"\n\nTrump, who has threatened to sue the filmmakers, called it \"a cheap, defamatory, and politically disgusting hatchet job\" designed to influence the presidential election.\n\n\"The Apprentice\" isn't setting records at the box office. The Hollywood Reporter said that the Trump movie \"opened to an estimated $1.6 million range from 1,740 locations, just enough to crack the top 10.\"\n\n\u2013 David Jackson\n\nLiz Cheney says she regrets years-long support for Donald Trump\n\nOn the heels of her high-profile endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris, former Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., said she regrets her previous support for GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump.\n\nIn a Sunday interview on \"Meet the Press,\" NBC host Kristen Welker asked Cheney if she regrets standing by Trump in the 2016 presidential election and several years afterwards while she served in Congress.\n\nWelker pointed to a 2016 debate between Trump and then-Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in which Trump said \"I'll tell you at the time. I'll keep you in suspense,\" when asked if he would commit to the principle of a peaceful transition of power.\n\n\"Congresswoman, do you regret standing by him at the time and for all of those years after?\" Welker said.\n\n\"Yes, I do,\" Cheney responded.\n\n\u2212 Kathryn Palmer\n\nWhat's a sovereign citizen?

The license plate was \u201cone that is homemade and indicative of a group of individuals that claim to be sovereign citizens,\u201d Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco told reporters Sunday.\n\nBut what is the Sovereign Citizen movement?

Trump has long had an adversarial relationship with Rep. Adam Schiff, who was lead prosecutor in his first impeachment trial .",
        "text": "\u2018The enemy from within\u2019: Trump calls Democrats more dangerous than U.S. foreign adversaries\nFormer President Donald Trump called Democrats and others who have opposed or investigated him \"the enemy from within\" in an interview that aired Sunday, describing them as more dangerous than major foreign adversaries of the United States, including Russia and China.\n\nTrump specifically singled out those whom he called \"lunatics that we have inside, like Adam Schiff,\" referring to the California representative and Democratic nominee for Senate, who was the lead prosecutor in the then-president's first Senate impeachment trial.\n\nDuring a pretaped interview on Fox News' \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" Trump was asked by host Maria Bartiromo about how he would handle bureaucrats who might seek to undermine him in a potential second term.\n\n\"I always say, we have two enemies,\" Trump said, adding: \"We have the outside enemy, and then we have the enemy from within, and the enemy from within, in my opinion, is more dangerous than China, Russia and all these countries.\"\n\nTrump added that a \"smart president\" could handle outside adversaries \"pretty easily,\" but \"the thing that's tougher to handle are these lunatics that we have inside, like Adam Schiff.\"\n\n\"I call him the enemy from within,\" he added.\n\nAs the 2024 presidential race enters the final weeks, the Republican nominee has increasingly labeled those opposed to him, including Vice President Kamala Harris, as criminals, and speech critical of him or his policies as illegal \u2014 a rhetorical focus of his in past races as well.\n\nTrump's comments on Sunday echoed remarks he made at a rally in Coachella, California, on Saturday evening, where he called Schiff \u201cshifty Schiff\u201d and \u201cthe enemy from within.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe conceived of the Russia hoax. ... He\u2019s a sick person,\u201d Trump said.\n\nIn response to a request for comment from NBC News on Sunday, Schiff\u2019s campaign pointed to a series of tweets the Democratic congressman posted Saturday night in response to Trump\u2019s rally remarks.\n\n\u201cYet another nonsensical rant about me filled with tired insults, lies about voting booths, and more, this time in my home state of California. Seriously, Donald. Why are you so obsessed with me?\u201d Schiff wrote.\n\nThe former president has long had an adversarial relationship with Schiff going back to the congressman's work as one of the impeachment managers in Trump's first impeachment in 2019. In posts on Truth Social, Trump has often referred to the congressman as \"shifty\" and alleged that he improperly investigated Trump's ties to Russia during the impeachment inquiry.\n\nHouse Republicans have joined Trump in his ire against Schiff, who is leading in the California Senate race against former baseball player Steve Garvey, a Republican.\n\nIn 2023, House Republicans censured Schiff on the House floor, alleging that he misrepresented special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into the 2016 Trump campaign's contacts with Russia. Mueller's report found no explicitly coordinated effort between Trump's campaign and Russia to influence the election.\n\n\"You look at the danger he put our country in, potentially with Russia, with the phony, made-up deal that he made up with Hillary and some bad people ... that started off as an excuse for why she lost an election that a lot of people thought she should have won,\" Trump added on Sunday.\n\nWhen asked about the upcoming election, Trump tried to tamp down fears \u2014 as expressed by President Joe Biden earlier this month \u2014 that chaos could again ensue like it did in 2020.\n\n\u201cNo I don\u2019t think so, not from the side that votes for Trump,\" the former president said, adding that any issues around the election wouldn't be because of outside agitators or foreign nations.\n\n\"I think the bigger problem is the enemy from within \u2026 We have some very bad people we have some sick people, radical left lunatics,\" he said.\n\nAny unrest, Trump said, \"should be very easily handled by, if necessary, by National Guard, or if really necessary by the military, because they can\u2019t let that happen.\"\n\nThe National Guard were famously delayed for hours in responding to the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, in part because Trump did not request that they be deployed on the day of the riot.",

And Cornell West is running as an independent candidate.\n\nWhile the polls show no third-party candidate is running a campaign strong enough to seriously challenge Harris or Trump, the campaigns will be keeping an eye on the support they are getting.\n\nRELATED STORY | Harris' physician reports the vice president is in 'excellent health' and fit to serve as president\n\nAs Politico's Brittany Gibson notes, West is capable of getting votes that may traditionally lean Democratic.\n\n\"He has really galvanized the pro-Palestinian true activist support,\" she said.\n\nExperts say that to understand just how consequential a third-party vote could be, look no further than Wisconsin.\n\nIn 2016, Trump won the state by a little more than 20,000 votes. In 2020, he lost by around the same margin.\n\nIn 2016, over 100,000 Wisconsin voters cast a ballot for the Libertarian candidate and over 30,000 cast a ballot for Stein, who ran that year as well.\n\nRELATED STORY | Eric Trump goes 1-on-1 with Scripps News about misinformation and the presidential campaign\n\nThe Democratic National Committee is acutely aware of the impact third-party candidates may have this year. Last week, they launched this attack ad against Stein, which is airing in swing states like Wisconsin.\n\n\"Stein was key to Trump's 2016 wins in battleground states,\" the ad says.\n\nThe biggest third-party question mark may involve someone who is no longer running for president. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. endorsed Trump weeks ago but is still on the ballot in many states, including some swing states. A recent Wisconsin poll showed Kennedy still earning 3% support.",

        "text": "How voting plays a role in health \u2013 and how health plays a role in who votes\n(kali9/E+ via Getty Images)\n\nThe act of voting is at the heart of a healthy democracy. A growing body of research is building the case that voting also plays an important role in physical health \u2013 which affects who votes.\n\nExperts on this back-and-forth say the connections are a weave of cultural, political and other factors that studies are just starting to unravel. But it's far from a fringe concept. Groups such as the American Medical Association, American Heart Association and American College of Physicians have endorsed the idea that voting plays a role in health, making voting access something that health care professionals should be addressing.\n\n\"I think there's a clarity that's growing\" about the connections, said Dr. Anita Chandra, vice president and director of RAND Social and Economic Well-Being, which is based in Arlington, Virginia. Chandra co-wrote a 2019 report on how civic engagement, which includes activities such voting and volunteering, is linked with physical and mental health and overall well-being.\n\nJust a decade ago, the idea of linking voting and health was controversial, said Chandra, whose background is in public health and child development. Today, she said, voting and other forms of civic engagement are increasingly seen as an essential element of health.\n\nResearchers describe the process as a kind of loop: Health can affect someone's ability to vote. Voting has a direct effect on public policy. That, in turn, influences people's health.\n\n\"It's not just about making sure people who are not in optimal health are engaged and voting,\" Chandra said, but how voting affects things such as access to parks, construction of safe sidewalks and other public policies that affect health.\n\nIn one historical example, after women in the U.S. won the right to vote in 1920, elected officials enacted public health measures championed by women, and child deaths fell by 20,000 a year, according to a 2008 study in the Quarterly Journal of Economics.\n\nDr. Ross Arena, a professor who is head of the department of physical therapy at the University of Illinois Chicago, has co-written several studies that look at connections between regional culture, voting and health.\n\nOne study, published in Public Health in Practice in August, found that counties with low voter turnout fared worse on a health index that included items such as physical activity, mental health, heart disease and whether a person currently smoked. The findings suggest \"poor health may be a powerful contributor to lower participation in the voting process,\" Arena and his colleagues wrote.\n\nOther factors that influence voter participation include age, race, education and income, as does access to voting methods, which varies by state.\n\nAnother article, published in The Lancet Regional Health-Americas in 2023, found that better access to voting correlated with better health as measured by an index of 12 factors such as premature mortality, infant mortality, active physicians and poverty.\n\nDr. Julianna Pacheco, a professor of political science at the University of Iowa in Iowa City, said that while the connections between voting and health are \"pretty clear,\" there are also nuances.\n\n\"If a person has physical limitations, it might be harder to get to the polls and especially burdensome to navigate the process of obtaining an absentee ballot,\" depending on where they live. \"For a person who is depressed, politics may not be something that is on their minds, and it may be extra difficult to learn about the candidates in a way to inform the vote.\"\n\nWhile some researchers have found that early civic engagement is associated with less depression later in life, Pacheco's work has shown how depression is linked to a lower likelihood of voting later in adulthood. Her research also found that poor self-rated health at the end of adolescence is associated with a lower chance of someone voting in their first election.\n\nWork by Pacheco and her colleagues shows that being in an educated family might mitigate the effect of poor health on voting among young people. Other research suggests poor health depresses turnout among low-income voters but not wealthier ones.\n\nThe correlations vary by disease. One 2015 study, published in the Journal of Health Politics, Policy and Law, looked at data from eight states in the 2008 election and found that people with cancer were more likely to vote than their peers without cancer, whereas people with heart disease were less likely to vote than those without heart problems.\n\n\"Different health issues sometimes create community,\" Chandra said, and some of those communities might be more supportive of political activity.\n\nThat sense of community, whether around a health condition or something broader, can be another piece of the puzzle in how voting contributes to health. Social isolation is a well-established risk factor for poor heart health and other problems. But voting, Chandra said, is an act of participation that provides a sense of connection as well as a \"sense of agency\" that a person has a voice.\n\nSome researchers have suggested that if unhealthy people don't have access to the polls, it could lead to a \"health bias\" in public policy, favoring the needs of healthier people.\n\nThe U.S. Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion includes increasing voter participation among the objectives of its Healthy 2030 project, a collection of data-driven goals aimed at improving public health.\n\nWhile recent national elections have had the highest turnout in decades, a 2023 Pew Research Center report found that only 66% of those eligible voted in the 2020 presidential election and only 46% turned out for the 2022 midterms. In the nation's largest cities, participation in local elections is even lower \u2013 a median 20% for municipal elections, according to researchers at Portland State University.\n\nArena is among those who say health care professionals at all levels have an important role to play in boosting voter access. \"It should be considered part of your professional responsibility to advocate for voting rights and access to voting,\" he said.\n\nOne effort to register people in waiting areas at two Bronx clinics in New York City during a 12-week period in 2012 successfully registered 114 people \u2013 89% of those who were eligible. The effort was written about in the Annals of Family Medicine.\n\nArena and Pacheco noted the success of nonpartisan efforts that give physicians and nurses badges with QR codes that link patients to voter registration information or let them request absentee ballots as local laws allow.\n\n\"A lot of people do not vote simply because nobody asks them to,\" said Pacheco, who said federal law gives community health care centers the discretion to support nonpartisan voter registration efforts.\n\nSome politicians consider such efforts to be partisan. But the work of Arena and his colleagues showed that the strength of the connection between poor health and low voter turnout was similar in Democratic and Republican regions. That suggests the influence of health on participation transcends political affiliation.\n\n\"The correlations are pretty consistent,\" he said. And once anyone has poor health, it could be a barrier to voting \"no matter what your ideology.\"\n\nArena's long-term goal in exploring the connections is to find ways to reach people who, for partisan or cultural reasons, have tuned out messages about public health. \"We're not resonating with big parts of the country,\" he said.\n\nBut, he said, \"if, in fact, political ideology impacts health decisions, and poor health impacts voter turnout, then there's an opportunity to have a bi-directional conversation. It's my responsibility as a health professional to start thinking about how to improve voter access, and hey, let's talk about how your culture and political ideology impact your health care decisions.\"\n\nChandra also said the discussion about voting and health shouldn't be partisan.\n\n\"Unfortunately, it, at times, has become one,\" she said, \"but it really shouldn't be.\"\n\nTo her, the focus should be on improving lives by helping people engage with their communities. \"If we're trying to enhance life expectancy, enhance life satisfaction, enhance optimism and reduce the diseases of despair, then I would say engagement as a general principle is certainly nonpartisan.\"",

        "text": "America's gun conundrum: Political implications for the 2024 presidential election\nAdvertisement America's gun conundrum: Political implications for the 2024 presidential election Share Copy Link Copy\n\nThe topic of guns is pervasive in American politics. It\u2019s also poignant and partisan. So, let's examine the contentious issue that could potentially determine the outcome of this year\u2019s election.This is a four-part series, breaking down the data, root causes, solutions and political implications of guns and gun violence in America. Here is Part 1, Part 2 and Part 3.This is Part 4: The political implications.On guns, former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris strongly reflect the state of the country: two sides starkly divided on foundational approaches, with some deviations interspersed.Trump, the Republican presidential nominee who is seeking a second term, is largely a committed gun rights advocate.\"I was proud to be the most pro-gun, pro-Second Amendment president you've ever had in the White House,\" Trump said at a National Rifle Association conference last year.During his first term, his administration opposed expanding the federal background check system to include private sales at gun shows and over the Internet by unlicensed dealers. He also opposed closing the so-called \u201cCharleston Loophole,\u201d which would extend the waiting periods for background checks from three days to 10 days.Additionally, he rescinded an Obama-era rule that would\u2019ve strengthened the reporting of mental illnesses to the FBI\u2019s National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). He also eased prohibitions on criminals obtaining guns by narrowing the definition of \"fugitive of law,\" which purged tens of thousands of records from the NICS.On top of that, Trump has continuously absolved the role of guns in mass shootings, suggesting stronger security measures, increased mental health attention and even arming teachers as more viable solutions.\"This is not a gun problem,\" he said at that same NRA conference last year. \"This is a mental health problem, this is a social problem, this is a cultural problem, this is a spiritual problem.\"State Rep. Bryan Fontenot, a Republican pro-gun rights legislator from Louisiana, appreciates Trump\u2019s perspective on the issue.\"The conversation should never really be about guns; the conversation needs to be about the crisis of mental health in this country,\" Fontenot said. \"We are not smart enough as a country to figure out that when someone has a mental illness, they shouldn\u2019t be able to purchase a gun.\"Addressing mental health\u2019s role in gun violence was actually a key component of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, a 2022 bill signed by President Joe Biden.The legislation earmarked over $750 million in funding for mental health services. So far, the Department of Health and Human Services has awarded nearly $245 million to support \"youth mental health, help the health care workforce address mental health needs, and fund other critical mental health supports.\"Aneesa McMillan, communications director for the Giffords Law Center, underlined the significance of the BSCA, noting that it was the first major piece of federal gun control legislation in 28 years.\"Common sense gun measures poll well not only with Democrats but also Republicans,\" McMillan said. \"That is one of the reasons why Vice President Harris and President Joe Biden were successful in passing the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which broke a nearly 30-year logjam on federal policy on the issue.\"The BSCA also extended background checks for firearm purchasers under the age of 21, tightened firearm license requirements, funded red flag laws at the state level, closed the so-called \"boyfriend loophole,\" and increased punishment for arms trafficking and straw purchases. Harris was, not surprisingly, a strong supporter of the bill. During her vice presidency, she took further steps to advocate for Extreme Risk Protection Orders (ERPOs), or red flag laws, and universal background checks.Her support for stricter gun laws goes back to her days as San Francisco district attorney from 2004 to 2011. In that office, she opposed pretrial release for people charged with gun crimes, cracked down on domestic abusers and worked with the state to craft some of the country's most expansive gun measures.In 2008, she worked with a group of lawyers to urge the Supreme Court to uphold a handgun ban in the landmark case, D.C. v. Heller. Her work was unsuccessful, as the court struck down the ban and ruled that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess firearms independent of service in a state militia and to use firearms for lawful purposes, including self-defense within the home.She continued her work on guns as California attorney general, overseeing gun sweeps to remove prohibited weapons, supporting restrictions for concealed carry and promoting microstamping.In the U.S. Senate, Harris co-sponsored bills to enact universal background checks, ban assault weapons, and increase oversight of federally licensed gun dealers.Other notable stances Harris has taken include advocating for the repeal of the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which shields gun manufacturers from liability, and backing a mandatory buyback program for assault weapons during her presidential run in 2019. She still maintains her support for an assault weapons ban.\"I feel very strongly that it\u2019s consistent with the Second Amendment to say we need an assault weapons ban,\" Harris said during an interview with a Philadelphia TV station earlier this month. \"They\u2019re literally tools of war; they were literally designed to kill a lot of people quickly.\"Harris and Trump have broken the mold of their gun views at times. As president, Trump signed the Fix NICS Act, a bipartisan bill that cleaned up the federal background check system and put parameters in place to increase coordination and efficiency. He also oversaw the Department of Justice\u2019s attempt to ban bump stocks in 2018, following the mass shootings in Las Vegas and Parkland, Florida. The Supreme Court, however, struck down that ban this year.Meanwhile, Harris has struck a more moderate tone on guns during her 2024 presidential campaign. \"We're not taking anyone\u2019s guns away, so stop with the continuous lying about this stuff,\" she said during the Sept. 10 debate with Trump, referring to his claims that she would \"confiscate everybody's gun\" if elected.She made headlines during a campaign event with Oprah Winfrey on Sept. 19, when she reconfirmed her ownership of a firearm and detailed her readiness to use it if need be.\"I'm a gun owner, (vice presidential candidate) Tim Walz is a gun owner\u2026 If somebody breaks into my house, they\u2019re getting shot,\" she said. \"Probably should not have said that. My staff will deal with that later.\"Fontenot said that, at the end of the day, neither candidate will move the needle on guns as much as Americans are led to believe, considering the influence of Congress and the courts.\"Every time there\u2019s a political election, there are winners and losers, and there are specific items that at some point come under attack,\" Fontenot said. \"President Trump has made his claim \u2026 that he believes in the Second Amendment gun rights. I think you\u2019ve seen Vice President Harris in the last debate say that she\u2019s a gun owner.\"He added, \"Any of those political maneuvers from the right or the left will ultimately be settled by the United States Supreme Court.\"McMillan, of Giffords Law Center, sees it differently. She believes there is a lot more at stake in this election.\"On the other side, you see almost this bragging, especially in the instance of Donald Trump, about not doing anything to address the problem,\" McMillan said. \"Which is a reflection of how we would approach this issue should he ascend to the White House for a second term.\"She added that her fear is that all of the progress made on addressing gun violence could be undone if Harris isn\u2019t elected to keep the momentum going.\"All of the initiatives \u2026 all of those key investments in legislation are at risk if we were to see a Trump/(JD) Vance administration because of how they have approached this issue, telling families to basically accept this as a way of life for Americans. It\u2019s unacceptable.\"",

        "text": "US presidential election: A Trump victory could influence the International Energy Agency\nFormer U.S. president and Republican U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump at a campaign rally at the Grand Sierra Resort in Reno, Nevada, October 11, 2024. ALEJANDRA RUBIO/AFP\n\nMario Loyola, who served on the White House Council on Environmental Quality during Donald Trump's presidency, said \"The US should definitely come up with a strategy to replace the leadership at the IEA [International Energy Agency]\" if Trump wins the election. His position is clear-cut.\n\nIn the run-up to the November 5 presidential election, this senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think-tank, echoes a growing sentiment in the Republican camp that the IEA \u2013 the benchmark organization created in the wake of the 1973 oil crisis \u2013 has betrayed its mission and is threatening global energy security. They attribute this to the influence of its leader, Turkish economist Fatih Birol, who they argue is more focused on aligning with climate activists than doing his job.\n\nIn recent years, the IEA, which is part of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), has made a clear and widely praised shift toward becoming a key player in the fight against climate change. Since 2021, Birol has repeated that there was no need to invest in new oil and gas fields, that fossil fuel producers \"must choose between contributing to a deepening climate crisis or becoming part of the solution,\" and \u2013 ironically \u2013 that the world is on track to peak demand for coal, gas and oil.\n\nIn the United States, the world's leading oil and gas producer, this new direction has elicited strong reactions from some business leaders and politicians alike. \"There is a fringe within the Republican movement that is very hostile to the energy transition, which is becoming active in Congress and in Mr. Trump's entourage, and which could become an influential movement,\" said Marc-Antoine Eyl-Mazzega, the director of the French Institute of International Relations' Energy and Climate Center.\n\n'Excessive focus on an energy transition'\n\nIn March, Republicans John Barrasso and Cathy McMorris Rodgers, members of the Senate and House Committees on Energy, respectively, expressed their criticism in a lengthy letter penned to Birol. The two lawmakers condemned the \"excessive focus on an 'energy transition'\" and \"biased\" and \"one-sided\" reports. They also took offense that US Deputy Energy Secretary David Turk, an IEA alumnus, defended the need to pause the approval of new liquefied natural gas (LNG) export projects based on the agency's research.\n\n\"This LNG pause has particularly upset Republicans,\" confirmed Anne-Sophie Corbeau, a researcher at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy. \"They see it as preventing them from launching projects and creating jobs.\"\n\nYou have 37.87% of this article left to read.

US election 'Nostradamus' has predicted the outcome of every U.S. presidential election since 1984 . If elected, Harris would be the first female president of mixed Asian and African descent .",
        "text": "US Election Predictions 2024: US election 'Nostradamus' Allan Lichtman predicts Kamala Harris will be first woman president\nUS historian and political scientist, Allan Lichtman (ANI)\n\nProminent American historian and political scientist Allan Lichtman , renowned for his accurate track record in predicting U.S. presidential elections, has forecast that the country will elect its first female president, with Kamala Harris expected to defeat Donald Trump in the upcoming election.Lichtman, a distinguished professor at American University, developed a prediction model called the \"Keys to the White House,\" which has accurately predicted the outcome of every U.S. presidential election since 1984. The system, created in collaboration with Russian geophysicist Vladimir Keilis-Borok in 1981, adapts methods originally designed for earthquake prediction. It operates on 13 key indicators, and according to Lichtman, if six or more of these keys go against the incumbent party, they are likely to lose the election; fewer than six, and they are predicted to win.In an interview with ANI, Lichtman says that there are only four keys that work against the incumbent Democrats, which means that Donald Trump will not be returning to the White House.\"The White House party (Democrats) loses key 1, the mandate key because they lost US House seats in 2022. They lost key number 3, the incumbency key because the sitting president was not running. They lose key number 12, the incumbent charisma key because what you may think of Harris, she's only been a candidate for a little while.She's not reached the status of a Franklin Roosevelt. And she loses key number 11, the foreign policy failure key, because the Middle East is a disaster, a humanitarian crisis with no good end in sight,\" the historian said.\u201cThat's four keys down, two keys short of what would be needed to predict Donald Trump's return to the White House and Harris losing. So the keys predict we're going to have a new pathbreaking president, our first woman president, and the first president of mixed Asian and African descent, kind of foreshadowing where America is going. We're rapidly becoming a majority-minority country. Old white guys like me are on the decline,\" he said.Speaking on the factors that work in Democrats' favour, Lichtman said there has been no recession in the election year, the third-party campaign has fizzled and Republicans have been unsuccessful in putting up a scandal against the Democrats.\"Well, as I said, they're only losing four. That means they're winning nine keys. The contest key, was because the Democrats united around Harris. The third-party key, because the campaign of RFK Jr. has fizzled. The short-term economic key, because there's no recession in the election year.The long-term economic key, because real per capita growth under the Biden term has vastly exceeded the average of the previous two terms. They win the policy change key because policies under Biden are fundamentally different from those under Trump.They win the social unrest key because the earlier sporadic demonstrations have fizzled away. They win the scandal key. Republicans have been trying for four years to pit a scandal on Biden and have come up empty\u201d, Litchman said.\"They win the foreign policy success key because it was Biden and Biden alone who put together the coalition of the West that stopped Putin from conquering Ukraine, as many predicted, and moving on to threatening America's NATO allies and undermining America's national security. They win the challenger charisma key because whatever you may think of Trump as a showman, he doesn't fit the definition of the key, which is a once-in-a-generation, across-the-board, inspirational candidate.He only appeals to a narrow base. In four years as president, his approval rating was just 41 per cent, right at the bottom, historically, of presidents. And in two consecutive elections, he lost the vote of the people by a combined 10 million votes. So that's why there are nine keys in favour of the Democrats,\" he further said.Vice President Kamala Harris, is the first woman, first Black, and first Asian American Vice President. If elected president, the 59-year-old would become the first woman in history to become the US president.She is up against former President Donald Trump, who is eyeing a historic return to the White House after a bitter exit in 2020. If he wins, it would be the first time in over 100 years in US history, that a President would serve two non-consecutive presidential terms, wrote ANI.The US presidential polls are scheduled to be held on November 5. Asked about whether there can be different winners among Democrats and Republicans in terms of electoral college and popular votes, Lichtman said he hasn't made any prediction on that aspect.He also emphasized that the keys don't change in the swing states which essentially decide the US election results and stood with his prediction of Harris win.The political scientist also termed the October surprise a major event that changed poll outcome ahead of the November poll -- as the \"biggest myth\" in American history.\"The October surprise is the biggest myth in American history. I've predicted all my elections, 10 elections, this is my 11th, well before any October surprise. We had the biggest October surprise ever in 2016 when Donald Trump was recorded on tape bragging about sexually assaulting women. A lot of pundits were saying, he's finished, he's done. I never changed my prediction of a Trump win, which proved to be correct,\" he said.Speaking on the two candidates, he further said that Trump is an inward-looking leader who is against the collective security of America's allies, while Harris is a 'typical' American president who believes in working with the allies. He also said that today America's standing is \"vastly better\" than what it was under four years of the Trump administration.\u201cTrump is an America first president or candidate, either one. He believes in turning inward. He's against collective security with our allies. Many times he's trashed our NATO alliance and our NATO allies are very worried about a Trump presidency. Harris is your typical president who believes in collective security, who believes in working with our allies and not trying to go it alone,\" Lichtman said.\"America's standing around the world is vastly better in terms of how America's perceived...the United States it was during the Trump Administration when he had basically trashed our allies,\u201d he further added.",

One presidential candidate survived two attempts on his life while the other stepped into the race at the 11th hour, without going through the primaries. Closer to home, Coloradans have more than a dozen consequential measures to vote on, from ranked-choice voting that could change the way candidates are elected to cementing abortion rights on the heels of an overturned Roe v. Wade.\n\nAs we assembled this guide, our team spoke with thousands of voters like you across the state to understand which issues you care about most as part of our Voter Voices initiative. Once we identified the top concerns, we got to work questioning candidates, reviewing their websites and watching forums and debates. Their profiles below were directly shaped by you.\n\nWe hope these resources help you feel informed and allow you to cast your ballot with confidence. And if you are looking for Southern Colorado or Denver-specific issues, you can find those guides below.\n\nHappy voting.",

        "text": "As the US election nears, anxiety is mounting in Ukraine\nThe coming United States presidential election will have truly global ramifications. Few countries have more at stake than Ukraine, which is heavily reliant on continued US support to maintain the fight against Russia\u2019s invasion. As the November 5 vote draws nearer, Ukrainians are anxiously observing the final weeks of the campaign.\n\nOver the past two-and-a-half years of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion, Ukrainian officials, military personnel, and members of the public have gone to considerable lengths to express their gratitude for US support and acknowledge the critical role this has played in their country\u2019s war effort. However, there is now a sense of disquiet over the future of US aid.\n\nUkrainian concerns are primarily focused on the potential consequences of a Donald Trump victory in the forthcoming election. While Ukrainian officials and commentators generally prefer not to make any public statements about the presidential race in order to avoid accusations of interfering in domestic US politics, many acknowledge a growing nervousness.\n\nUncertainty in Kyiv over the former president\u2019s position is not a new phenomenon and can be traced back almost a decade to the 2016 US presidential race. \u201cTrump\u2019s view of Ukraine has been persistently negative for the last eight years at least,\u201d Odesa National University Center for International Studies director Volodymyr Dubovyk commented in September 2024. \u201cMuch of this view was shaped by people antagonistic to Ukraine.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s support for Ukraine while in the White House, which included the delivery of Javelin anti-tank missiles, did much to rebuild confidence in Kyiv. He also chose not to use his influence over Republican members of Congress to block aid for Ukraine earlier this year. Nevertheless, there is currently considerable unease over the former US president\u2019s vague plans for peace with Russia, which many Ukrainians fear would involve unacceptable territorial concessions.\n\nStay updated\n\nAs the world watches the Russian invasion of Ukraine unfold, UkraineAlert delivers the best Atlantic Council expert insight and analysis on Ukraine twice a week directly to your inbox.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has sought to downplay concerns by referring to Trump\u2019s more troubling campaign trail rhetoric on Ukraine as \u201celection messages.\u201d Despite these efforts, there remains significant uncertainty over what a Trump victory would mean for Ukraine, with some worried that he would be likely to adopt a softer approach toward Russia.\n\nThe sense of anxiety in Ukraine has been heightened by recent revelations in a new book by US journalist Bob Woodward, who claims Trump sent COVID-19 testing equipment to Russia in 2020 for President Vladimir Putin\u2019s personal use. The book also alleges that Trump and Putin may have spoken up to seven times since Trump left the White House in 2021, according to an unnamed aide.\n\nTrump campaign officials have denied these accusations. The Kremlin has confirmed that Russia did receive COVID tests from the United States, but has downplayed the significance of the gesture.\n\nThroughout the current election campaign, Trump\u2019s comments on Ukraine have centered on his commitment to ending the current war in one day, while also claiming that Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine would never have happened if he had remained in office. Speaking alongside Zelenskyy in New York in September, Trump highlighted his \u201cvery good relationships\u201d with both Putin and Zelenskyy, while insisting that he could broker a settlement between the two leaders \u201cvery quickly.\u201d\n\nNot everyone in Ukraine is convinced a Trump presidency would be bad news for the country. Some prefer to emphasize Trump\u2019s important contribution in April 2024 when he chose not to come out against House Speaker Mike Johnson\u2019s Ukraine aid bill, which likely would have prevented it from passing Congress. Allies of the former president have also said that he is receptive to advice from a number of officials who have cautioned him about the potentially dangerous repercussions of a Russian victory in Ukraine.\n\nPerhaps the most detailed outline of possible future US policy toward Ukraine during a potential second Trump presidency has come from Trump\u2019s vice presidential nominee, Senator JD Vance. In a September 2024 interview, Vance indicated that Trump\u2019s peace plan for Ukraine would involve allowing Russia to remain in control of the Ukrainian regions it currently occupies, establishing a demilitarized zone, and obliging Ukraine to commit to neutrality.\n\nIf implemented, such a settlement would likely be seen as a significant victory in Moscow. Critics have warned that it would also jeopardize Ukraine\u2019s future security and could set the stage for further Russian aggression. However, it is important to underline that Vance\u2019s comments have not been endorsed by Trump and do not represent official policy.\n\nTrump\u2019s often evasive statements on Ukraine may suggest that he is keeping his options open for the future. While much of his rhetoric in relation to Ukraine has set off alarm bells in Kyiv, he has also been supportive of US aid to the country and is doubtless aware that many in his own party continue to favor a strong pro-Ukrainian position.\n\nRecent allegations regarding the former US president\u2019s personal relations with Putin will do little to ease existing concerns in Ukraine. If Trump does win a second term next month, his approach to the Russian invasion of Ukraine may ultimately depend on the advice he receives from those closest to him. Ukrainians will be hoping that bipartisan political backing for their country and continued indications of strong support for Ukraine among the US public will be enough to prevent any major shifts in United States policy.\n\nKate Spencer is a program assistant at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Eurasia Center.\n\nFurther reading\n\nThe views expressed in UkraineAlert are solely those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Atlantic Council, its staff, or its supporters.\n\nThe Eurasia Center\u2019s mission is to enhance transatlantic cooperation in promoting stability, democratic values and prosperity in Eurasia, from Eastern Europe and Turkey in the West to the Caucasus, Russia and Central Asia in the East.

The continued investment in cleantech industries highlights the economic benefits of renewable energy and underscores the impact of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).\n\nCleantech is increasingly becoming a bipartisan success story in the US. This is underscored by our analysis, which shows the bulk of cleantech projects, from solar and batteries to hydrogen and carbon capture, are located in Republican strongholds. The tangible economic benefits are driving widespread support, ensuring that the economic momentum behind cleantech is likely to remain robust even under a potential Republican presidency. These sectors are poised to continue expanding, whether we see a red or blue outcome in November, Lars Nitter Havro, Head of Energy Macro Research, Rystad Energy\n\n*This chart has been updated to correct a mislabeling error.\n\nLearn more with Rystad Energy\u2019s Energy Scenarios Solution.\n\nBased on Donald Trump\u2019s previous tenure, there has been speculation about his stance on cleantech development, particularly following his withdrawal of the US from the Paris Agreement on climate change. However, cleantech initiatives did not come to a grinding halt during his time in office. Many projects from the Obama administration continued under Trump, and his administration even implemented a four-year, 30% tariff on imported solar panels and modules in 2018 to protect and stimulate domestic solar manufacturing by making imported products more expensive. Notably, more onshore wind capacity was added during Trump\u2019s term than under Biden so far, suggesting that the wind industry may be more affected by economic factors, such as interest rates, than by the political climate in the Oval Office.\n\nIf the Republican party wins the 2024 presidential election, the incoming administration will inherit the IRA and numerous pre-approved clean energy projects, making it unlikely that these initiatives would be abandoned. Despite a mixed record on cleantech, fossil fuel production during Trump's presidency was lower than current levels under Biden, and the growth of investments maintained a striking similarity, indicating a persistent momentum in US decarbonization efforts.\n\nAssuming a Republican White House and Senate majority in 2025, we could see efforts to roll back or weaken the climate and environmental policies of the Biden administration, including the IRA. This may impact electric vehicle (EV) adoption and lead to reduced environmental regulations and streamlined permitting for fossil fuel projects. Of course, due to the nature of the legislative process in the US, if a Republican president is faced with a Democrat-controlled House of Representatives, any major repeal attempts could be blocked. However, executive actions could still enable regulatory changes, potentially slowing the momentum toward renewable energy and EV adoption.\n\nRecent legislative proposals, such as vice-presidential candidate Senator J.D. Vance's \"Drive American Act\", which seeks to repeal EV tax credits and provide incentives for internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, are still in the early stages. However, President Trump's recent shift to a more favorable stance on EVs, influenced by Tesla CEO Elon Musk\u2019s endorsement, suggests potential policy changes sparing some EV incentives. Additionally, the \u201cLimit, Save, Grow Act,\u201d aiming to reduce funding for green energy and clean projects, faces challenges in the Senate, with some provisions already removed due to internal opposition.\n\nThe chance of repealing the IRA remains low, even with a Republican Senate majority, due to concerns about competitiveness, job creation, and countering China. However, differing Republican and Democratic priorities could lead to legislative gridlock, impacting energy projects and possibly prompting states to develop varied energy policies, with some focusing on renewables and others on fossil fuels.\n\nContacts\n\nLars Nitter Havro\n\nHead of Energy Transition Analytics\n\nPhone: +47 90 56 01 67\n\nlars.nitter.havro@rystadenergy.com\n\n\n\nKartik Selvaraju\n\nMedia Relations Manager\n\nPhone: +65 8779 4619\n\nkartik.selvaraju@rystadenergy.com\n\nAbout Rystad Energy\n\nRystad Energy is a leading global independent research and energy intelligence company dedicated to helping clients navigate the future of energy.

        "text": "Fortinet FortiGuard Labs Observes Darknet\nSUNNYVALE, Calif., Oct. 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\n\nDerek Manky, Chief Security Strategist and VP of Global Threat Intelligence at Fortinet\n\n\u201cAs the 2024 U.S. presidential election approaches, it\u2019s critical to recognize and understand the cyberthreats that may impact the integrity and trustworthiness of the election process and the welfare of the participating citizens. Cyber adversaries, including state-sponsored actors and hacktivist groups, are increasingly active leading up to major events like elections. Remaining vigilant and identifying and analyzing potential cyberthreats and vulnerabilities is crucial for preparing and safeguarding against the lures and targeted cyberattacks that could take advantage of a heightened moment in time and even disrupt or influence electoral outcomes.\u201d\n\nNews Summary\n\nFortinet \u00ae (NASDAQ: FTNT), the global cybersecurity leader driving the convergence of networking and security, today released its FortiGuard Labs Threat Intelligence Report: Threat Actors Targeting the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election, which reveals and analyzes threats tied to U.S.-based entities, voters, and the electoral process. Key findings from the threat intelligence report include:\n\nPhishing Scams Targeting Voters Leading Up to the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election: Threat actors are selling affordable phishing kits on the darknet designed to target voters and donors by impersonating the presidential candidates and their campaigns.\n\nThreat actors are selling affordable phishing kits on the darknet designed to target voters and donors by impersonating the presidential candidates and their campaigns. Malicious Domain Registrations on the Rise: More than 1,000 new potentially malicious domains have also been registered since the beginning of 2024 that follow particular patterns and incorporate election-related content and candidates, suggesting that threat actors are leveraging the heightened interest surrounding the election to lure unsuspecting targets and potentially conduct malicious activities.\n\nMore than 1,000 new potentially malicious domains have also been registered since the beginning of 2024 that follow particular patterns and incorporate election-related content and candidates, suggesting that threat actors are leveraging the heightened interest surrounding the election to lure unsuspecting targets and potentially conduct malicious activities. Darknet Landscape: Billions of records from the U.S. are for sale on darknet forums, including Social Security numbers (SSNs), personally identifiable information (PII), and credentials that could be used in misinformation campaigns and lead to fraudulent activity, phishing scams, and account takeover; approximately 3% of the posts on darknet forums involve databases related to business and government entities.\n\nBillions of records from the U.S. are for sale on darknet forums, including Social Security numbers (SSNs), personally identifiable information (PII), and credentials that could be used in misinformation campaigns and lead to fraudulent activity, phishing scams, and account takeover; approximately 3% of the posts on darknet forums involve databases related to business and government entities. Ransomware Landscape: FortiGuard Labs researchers noted a 28% increase in ransomware attacks against the U.S. government year-over-year based on observed leak sites.\n\nScams Targeting the U.S. 2024 Presidential Election Flood the Darknet\n\nCyber adversaries, including state-sponsored actors and hacktivist groups, are increasingly active in the lead-up to elections.\n\nThe FortiGuard Labs research team observed threat actors selling distinct phishing kits for $1,260 each, created to impersonate U.S. presidential candidates. These kits are designed to harvest personal information, including names, addresses, and credit card (donation) details.\n\nSince January 2024, FortiGuard Labs researchers have also identified more than 1,000 newly registered domain names that incorporate election-related terms and references to prominent political figures. Fraudulent fundraising websites, including secure[.]actsblues[.]com, meant to imitate the legitimate site for ActBlue (secure[.]actblue[.]com), a nonprofit American fundraising platform and political action committee.\n\nThe top two most-used hosting providers for these election-themed websites are AMAZON-02 and CLOUDFLARENET. The reliance on major hosting platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Cloudflare suggests that threat actors are leveraging these reputable services to enhance the legitimacy and resilience of their malicious domains.\n\nA notable concentration of domains is associated with a limited number of IP addresses, indicating a centralized approach by threat actors to efficiently manage multiple malicious domains to execute large-scale cyber campaigns.\n\nNo Shortage of Personal Data Being Sold Aimed at the U.S.\n\nFortiGuard Labs analysis continues to show a significant number of diverse databases available on darknet forums targeting the U.S., including SSNs, usernames, email addresses, passwords, credit card data, date of birth, and other PII that could be used to challenge the integrity of the 2024 U.S. election. Specific highlights include:\n\nOver 1.3 billion rows of combo lists, which include usernames, email addresses, and passwords, signify a considerable risk for credential-stuffing attacks. In such attacks, cybercriminals use these stolen credentials to gain unauthorized access to accounts, making it a valid and substantial security concern.\n\nThe discovery of 300,000 rows of credit card data, which include CVV, name, card number, expiration date, and date of birth, highlights potential financial fraud risks targeting voters and election officials.\n\nOver 2 billion rows of user databases on the darknet indicate a heightened exposure to identity theft and targeted phishing attacks.\n\n10% of the posts on darknet forums are associated with SSN databases, which poses a significant threat by increasing the risk of personal data breaches.\n\nThe U.S. Government Is an Increasingly Attractive Target\n\nRansomware attacks targeting government agencies before an election can impact the electoral process and public trust in government institutions. Compared to 2023, the FortiGuard Labs research team observed a 28% spike in ransomware attacks against the U.S. government in 2024.\n\nThe darknet has become a hub for U.S.-specific threats, where malicious actors trade sensitive information and can potentially develop strategies to exploit vulnerabilities. Approximately 3% of the posts on these forums involve databases related to business and government entities. These databases hold critical organizational data that is vulnerable to cyber exploits and are a prime target for threat actors as the elections come and go.\n\nRecommendations to Prevent and Mitigate Cyberattacks this Election Season\n\nCybersecurity measures are critical to safeguard the integrity of the U.S. 2024 presidential election. Following fundamental best practices can help prevent and mitigate the effects of cyber incidents. The full list of recommendations and best practices can be found in the report, but some key takeaways for citizens, business leaders, and election officials include:\n\nAlways remain vigilant for suspicious behavior or activity leading up to major events and prioritize good cyber hygiene.\n\nPrioritize employee training and awareness.\n\nEnforce multi-factor authentication and a strong-password policy.\n\nInstall endpoint protection solutions.\n\nPatch operating systems and web servers and update software regularly.\n\n\n\nAbout the Fortinet FortiGuard Labs Election Security Report\n\nThis report provides an in-depth analysis of threats observed from January 2024 to August 2024. It examines the diverse array of cyberthreats that may affect U.S.-based entities and the electoral process.\n\n\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nAbout Fortinet\n\nFortinet (NASDAQ: FTNT) is a driving force in the evolution of cybersecurity and the convergence of networking and security.

        "text": "'Dead heat': Trump pulls even with Harris in NBC News poll\nFormer President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are deadlocked in the latest national NBC News poll, with Trump bolstered by Republicans coming back home to support him after last month\u2019s rough debate and a subsequent polling deficit, as well as by a favorable voter assessment of Trump\u2019s term as president.\n\nThese are among the findings of a new survey released three weeks before Election Day, which also shows Harris\u2019 popularity declining compared to a month ago, after she got a big summertime boost; a massive gender gap between support for Harris and Trump; and voters viewing abortion as a top motivating issue heading into the 2024 vote.\n\n\u201cAs summer has turned to fall, any signs of momentum for Kamala Harris have stopped,\u201d said Democratic pollster Jeff Horwitt, who conducted this survey with Republican pollster Bill McInturff. \u201cThe race is a dead heat.\u201d\n\nFollow live updates on the 2024 election\n\nMcInturff said \u201cheadwinds\u201d for Harris have helped narrow the presidential contest, including concerns that the vice president doesn\u2019t represent change from President Joe Biden and voters seeing Trump\u2019s presidency in a more positive light than Biden\u2019s.\n\n\u201cShe is asking for another term from the incumbent party,\u201d McInturff said of Harris.\n\nNBC News\n\nStill, underlining the poll is uncertainty about the election (with 10% of voters saying they might change their minds and a sliver of unclaimed voters still on the fence), an all-time-high share of voters believing that this presidential election will make \u201ca great deal of difference\u201d in their lives, and key challenges for both Harris and Trump. The third-party vote could play a role, too \u2014 Trump gets a small boost when third-party candidates are included in the ballot test, to a 1-point edge.\n\nAnd in a finely balanced election, even small changes in turnout among different groups could be the difference between a win and a loss for either party.\n\n\u201cThe challenge for Kamala Harris: Can she meet the moment and fill in the blanks that voters have about her?\u201d asked Horwitt, the Democratic pollster.\n\n\u201cThe challenge for Donald Trump: Can he make the case that the chaos and personal behavior that bothered so many about his first term will not get in the way of governing and representing America?\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThe next month will tell whether the candidates can meet these challenges,\u201d Horwitt said.\n\nIn the new poll \u2014 which was conducted Oct. 4-8 \u2014 Harris gets support from 48% of registered voters in a head-to-head matchup, while Trump gets an identical 48%. Another 4% say they are undecided or wouldn\u2019t vote for either option when forced to choose between those two major-party candidates.\n\n(Read more here from NBC News\u2019 pollsters on why this poll measures registered voters and not likely voters.)\n\nThat\u2019s a change from September\u2019s NBC News poll, which found Harris leading Trump by 5 points, 49%-44%, though that result was within the margin of error.\n\nAn expanded ballot including third-party candidates also shows this shift, with 47% of registered voters in the new poll picking Trump, 46% supporting Harris and a combined 7% picking other candidates or saying they\u2019re undecided.\n\nIn September, however, Harris held a 6-point lead on this expanded ballot.\n\nGiven that close elections are often decided by which party better turns out its voters, the NBC News poll provides a snapshot of what could happen depending on different turnout scenarios.\n\nAssuming a more favorable environment for Republicans \u2014 which means slightly greater turnout among men, white voters and voters without college degrees \u2014 Trump leads Harris by 2 points, 49%-47%.\n\nBut assuming a more favorable turnout environment for Democrats \u2014 which means more women, more white voters with college degrees and more voters of color showing up to the polls \u2014 these survey results show Harris leading Trump by 3 points among registered voters, 49%-46%.\n\nAll of these results are within the poll\u2019s margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.\n\n(Read here for an in-depth breakdown of these different turnout scenarios and how they would affect the election.)\n\nA massive gender gap\n\nAt 48%-48%, the survey results are as close as possible. But among different groups, there are enormous variations in candidate support.\n\nThe poll finds Harris with her biggest advantages over Trump among Black voters (84%-11%), younger voters ages 18 to 34 (57%-37%) and white voters with college degrees (55%-41%).\n\nTrump, meanwhile, leads among rural voters (75%-23%), white voters (56%-42%) and whites without college degrees (65%-33%).\n\nYet what also stands out as one of the defining features of the election is a massive gender gap between Harris and Trump, with women supporting Harris by a 14-point margin (55%-41%) and men backing Trump by 16-points (56%-40%).\n\nIndependent voters are essentially split in the poll, with Harris getting support from 44% of them versus 40% choosing Trump. Compared to other groups, there are more independents who have yet to choose between Harris and Trump \u2014 or who say they don\u2019t want to pick either of them.\n\nHarris\u2019 popularity declines\n\nAnother significant change in the NBC News poll since September is Harris\u2019 popularity.\n\nOne of the major developments in September\u2019s NBC News poll, conducted after the Harris-Trump debate on Sept. 10, was her double-digit increase in popularity compared to earlier in the summer, before she became Democrats\u2019 presidential candidate. Her ratings shot upward to 48% positive, 45% negative (a +3 net rating).\n\nBut in this latest poll, Harris\u2019 rating stands at 43% positive, 49% negative (-6), with the erosion coming mainly from independents and young voters.\n\nThat\u2019s not too far removed from Trump\u2019s 43% positive, 51% negative score (-8) in this same poll. That positive rating is Trump\u2019s highest in the NBC News poll since he left office.\n\nPerceptions of Biden\u2019s presidency lag Trump\u2019s\n\nAnother storyline from the poll is voters\u2019 different views of Biden\u2019s presidency versus Trump\u2019s \u2014 a key question given the candidates\u2019 efforts to cast themselves as agents of change in this election.\n\nTwenty-five percent of voters say Biden\u2019s policies have helped them and their families, compared with 45% who believe they\u2019ve hurt them.\n\nThose numbers are essentially flipped on views of Trump\u2019s past presidency: 44% of voters say the former president\u2019s policies helped them, versus 31% who say they hurt them.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, looking back on Trump\u2019s presidency, 48% of voters say they approved of the former president\u2019s job performance. That\u2019s a higher job-approval rating than Trump ever held in the NBC News poll when he was president.\n\nIt also stands in contrast to Biden\u2019s current 43% approval in the poll.\n\nAnd asked what concerns them more \u2014 Harris continuing the same approach as Biden or Trump continuing the same approach from his first term as president \u2014 43% of voters say they are more concerned about Harris following in Biden\u2019s path, compared with 41% who are more worried about Trump repeating the actions of his term.\n\n\u201cThe fact that Harris trails even slightly on this measure is a warning sign, because voters are more likely to believe that Biden\u2019s policies are hurting their family, while Trump\u2019s policies helped their family,\u201d said Horwitt, the Democratic pollster.\n\nAbortion is the top motivating issue \u2014 and the best issue for Harris\n\nWhile most public polls, including September\u2019s national NBC News poll, find the cost of living ranking as voters\u2019 top concern, this survey asked a different question to get at voter intensity and motivation heading into Election Day: Is there one issue you feel so strongly about that you will vote for or against a candidate solely on that issue?\n\nThe top responses, with multiple allowed: abortion (22%), immigration/border security (19%), protecting democracy or constitutional rights (18%) and cost of living (16%).\n\nThe NBC News poll also tested Harris and Trump on nine different issues and presidential qualities, including who would better handle some of the key issues voters see as their top priorities.\n\nHarris\u2019 best issue versus Trump was abortion (19-point lead over Trump on handling the issue), health care (+10) and being competent and effective (+5).\n\nTrump\u2019s top issues and qualities: dealing with the border (+25), handling the situation in the Middle East (+18) and dealing with the cost of living (+11).\n\nOn the key matter of which candidate better represents change, Harris is ahead of Trump by 5 points, 45% to 40%, but that\u2019s down from her 9-point lead here in September.\n\nOther important poll findings\n\nSixty-two percent of registered voters believe the upcoming presidential election will make a \u201cgreat deal of difference\u201d in their lives. That\u2019s the highest response on this NBC News poll question dating back to 1992.\n\nLike on the presidential ballot, Democrats and Republicans are tied on congressional preference, with 47% of registered voters preferring a Democratic-controlled Congress, and with an identical 47% wanting Republicans in charge. Democrats held a 2-point lead in September, 48%-46%, which was within the margin of error.\n\nAnd 31% of voters believe the nation is headed in the right direction, while 64% think it\u2019s on the wrong track. The share of voters believing the country is on the wrong track is the lowest it\u2019s been in the poll since August 2021, which was also the last time Biden had a positive job approval rating in the poll.\n\nThe NBC News poll of 1,000 registered voters, 898 of whom were reached by cellphone, was conducted Oct. 4-8. It has an overall margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.",

        "text": "ELECTIONS: What Americans still have in common\nLooking at American life through literature is a great way to remind people that Americans have more shared experiences rather than differences, said Susan Straight, author and distinguished professor of creative writing at UC Riverside.\n\nWith the 2024 presidential elections around the corner, it is important to remember the shared humanity, love for family, and respect for neighbors, said Straight, who spent five years reading 1,001 novels that document American life. Last year she worked on a project alongside an Esri engineer to display those novels across an interactive U.S. map.\n\n\u201cThis is my love letter to the United States, to our powers of narrative and laughter, to the way we need to treasure every region of this extraordinary country, with geography that shapes all our lives, to honor the rivers and mountains, subways and freeways, deserts and forests, bayous and canyons of the nation,\u201d Straight said in an essay introducing the project.\n\nSusan Straight's \"Library of America\" map by Esri.\n\nThe map is divided into 11 regions and the 1,001 number is a tribute to Scheherazade, the central female character and storyteller in \u201cThe Arabian Nights.\u201d\n\nStraight calls the project a \u201cLibrary of America,\u201d born in 2016 when news stories were constantly inching at dividing America along party lines.\n\nStraight is the author of 10 books, her most recent is \u201cMecca,\u201d a novel that weaves the past and present into stories that reflect the lives of millions of ordinary people in the Inland Empire. She says she always writes about \u201ccharacters trying to find home, even if they migrate, how they carry home with them in language, food, and story, just as my own mother did when she arrived in Fontana, California, at 19, from the Alps of Switzerland.\u201d\n\nQ: Can reading serve as a healing agent in this current divisive political climate?\n\nA: I began working on the first edition of this Library of America literary map in January 2017, on an Inauguration Day when the news media kept declaring the election had made clear that America was divided into Red and Blue states, I kept seeing the huge maps everywhere, showing only those two colors, as if there were no places more complicated than politics.\n\nThat night, scenes from so many novels came into my head, places like Ernest J. Gaines\u2019 Louisiana, Louise Erdrich\u2019s North Dakota, Kent Haruf\u2019s Colorado, and Grace Paley\u2019s New York. I began writing down titles and wanting to make a beautiful map of America where home was the defining illustration for each novel.\n\nOne of my former students, Vanessa Hua, calls the places I write about, in Southern California, \u201chidden kingdoms,\u201d and I love that \u2013 she writes about the Bay Area, my former student Alex Espinoza writes about East LA and Colton.\n\nWorking with Esri was a joy \u2013 we found covers for the first editions of 737 books that year, and I delved deeply into GIS to find specific locations for each book, often reading old interviews with authors long passed away.\n\nLiterature takes us to places we might already know and love, but more often, it allows us to travel somewhere we might never visit, to hear people speaking as they do in Chicago or Boston or Washington D.C., or in small towns of Kansas or Virginia or New Mexico, those specific regional languages that make America fascinating and beloved.\n\nReading can heal us, can make us understand each other as neighbors in any city or town, whether our parents came from another country two generations ago, or arrived last year, whether we work as landscapers or tech giants, whether we share a faith or believe differently. Story lets us linger with strangers, and friends.\n\nQ: Through the 1,001 novels featured in this project, what shared experiences stood out to you? What common threads unite Americans?\n\nA: The larger second edition of the map, 1001 Novels, was finished in May 2023, published with Esri and the Los Angeles Times, and shared hundreds of thousands of times around the world.\n\nSo many common threads became clear as I continued to work on the project. Many novels were about young people and their animals, classics like \u201cOld Yeller,\u201d set in Texas, \u201cSounder,\u201d set in Louisiana, \u201cMy Friend Flicka,\u201d set in Wyoming, and \u201cThe Yearling,\u201d set in Florida. Many great novels were about teens and young adults navigating their identities in dangerous or violent situations, sometimes because of their backgrounds \u2013 these include \u201cFinding My Voice,\u201d by Marie Myung-Ok Lee, set in 1970s Minnesota, \u201cUnder the Feet of Jesus\u201d by Helena Maria Viramontes, set in Central California, and \u201cHoles,\u201d by Louis Sachar, set in Texas, as well as classics such as \u201cA Tree Grows in Brooklyn\u201d by Betty Smith.\n\nMaybe my favorite aspect of working for years on this map is how many \u201chidden kingdoms\u201d I discovered where the landscape leads to loyalty, family and survival, from Indigenous peoples in 1870 Montana Territory in James Welch\u2019s \u201cFools Crow\u201d to Irish American neighborhoods in Dennis Lehane\u2019s \u201cMystic River\u201d and Michael Connelly\u2019s \u201cLos Angeles,\u201d where as his detective Harry Bosch says a truth I believe: Everybody counts, or nobody counts.\n\nSusan Straight standing by her Fence Library.

Ohio Senator JD Vance, 40, is his vice-presidential candidate.Jill Stein is running for the Green Party, having previously contested in 2012 and 2016, while Chase Oliver is the Libertarian Party\u2019s candidate.And, Robert Kennedy Jr , son of the former attorney general and nephew of US President John F Kennedy , has suspended his independent campaign and endorsed Trump.Stein\u2019s previous runs and the Green Party\u2019s 2020 candidate, Howie Hawkins, reflect the ongoing presence of third-party challengers, though they have yet to pose a serious threat to the two-party dominance in US presidential elections There are numerous other candidates affiliated with other minor parties or those who are running independently, but do not have majority ballot access.A US voter does not directly vote for president. Instead, voters cast votes for electors in the Electoral College, a body that ultimately chooses the president.There are 538 electors in total, representing 435 members of the House of Representatives , 100 Senators, and 3 electors from Washington DC. The magic number for victory is 270 electoral votes \u2014 an absolute majority.Each state\u2019s allocation of electors is proportional to its representation in Congress, so a larger state like California has more electors (55) compared to smaller states like North Dakota (3).The candidate who wins the most votes in a state typically takes all of that state\u2019s electoral votes a system used in 48 states and Washington DC. Maine and Nebraska, however, use a proportional system that can split electoral votes based on district-level and statewide results.The 2020 census altered the distribution of electors by shifting seats in the House of Representatives. For instance, Texas gained two additional seats and now holds 40 electoral votes, while states like California, New York, and Michigan each lost one electoral vote. This redistribution reflects population changes and impacts the electoral weight of different states in upcoming elections.As a result of this system, candidates can lose the popular vote but still win the presidency by securing key electoral votes, as demonstrated in the 2016 election, when Hillary Clinton garnered almost 3 million more votes than Trump but lost in the Electoral College.In 2000, George W Bush won the presidency with 271 electoral votes, while his opponent, Al Gore, won the popular vote by over half a million.Early voting and absentee voting also play a vital role. Although the official election date is November 5, 2024, Americans have a choice to cast their votes weeks in advance through mail-in ballots or in-person early voting.Early voting picked up in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with absentee ballots accounting for 42 per cent of the total votes cast, according to the MIT Election Data + Science Lab. In total, 158 million votes were cast in the 2020 election, with absentee voting reaching a high of 66.4 million \u2014 up from 28.8 million in 2016.Trump claimed that absentee voting was \u201cfraudulent,\u201d but research has shown that\u2019s a very rare scenario. In the 2022 mid-term elections, absentee voting fell to 32 per cent, but it continues to remain a crucial voting method for many Americans.Early voting is widely accessible in 47 states, along with territories like Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. In most states, voters do not need a specific reason to cast their votes early, but some states require individuals to request absentee ballots for early voting.Only three states \u2014 Alabama, Mississippi, and New Hampshire \u2014 do not offer early in-person voting.The earliest set of results is typically known by the end of election night. Polling stations generally close between 6:00 pm and 8:00 pm, with the winner often projected by 11:00 pm Eastern Time.However, the rise in mail-in ballots has led to delays in final results, particularly in swing states where margins are tight. In 2020, for instance, Joe Biden was declared the winner only after multiple days of counting in critical battleground states.Media outlets such as CNN, NBC, and ABC rely on real-time vote counts and exit polls to project winners, while the Associated Press (AP) uses a more conservative approach. The AP employs around 4,000 correspondents across the country and only declares a winner once they are certain that the remaining uncounted ballots will not change the outcome.The final step in the election process occurs in December when the Electoral College formally casts its votes. State governors or secretaries of state certify the results, and on January 6, 2025, Congress will officially count the electoral votes.The newly elected president will be inaugurated on January 20, 2025, marking the start of a four-year term.Swing states play an outsized role in determining the outcome of presidential elections. These states do not have a consistent pattern of voting for one party and can swing either Republican or Democrat in any given election.Key swing states in 2024 are likely to include Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Winning these states is often decisive for candidates due to the significant number of electoral votes at stake.Campaigns pour millions of dollars into advertising and voter outreach in swing states. As of November 2023, Trump was leading in all but Wisconsin, highlighting how competitive these states can be.In addition to presidential votes, voters in many of these states will also be deciding on crucial local issues, including referendums on abortion rights in states like Montana and Arizona.The US presidential election is just one part of the broader voting process. On November 5, 2024, Americans will also elect 468 members of Congress, comprising 33 senators and all 435 members of the House of Representatives.Eleven states and two territories will hold gubernatorial elections, while various local offices and referendums will also be on the ballot. For example, a referendum in Montana will determine whether abortion rights should be enshrined in the state\u2019s constitution.These elections, along with the presidential race, form a dynamic and multifaceted process that reflects the decentralized nature of the US electoral system. Voters play a direct role in shaping not only national leadership but also local and state policies that impact everyday life.",

In the last several months, Moscow has dedicated millions of dollars to influencing Moldova\u2019s presidential election. We assess that this money has gone toward financing its preferred parties and spreading disinformation on social media in favor of their campaigns.\u201d\n\nThe Russian state has authorized this effort to spend significant sums of money to influence the election. Additionally, known Russian influence actor, Ilan Shor, has invested tens of millions of dollars per month into nonprofit organizations that spread narratives about the election in line with Russian interests. These nonprofits have promoted pro-Russia content on traditional media, on local websites, and through social media applications.\n\nWe continue to have full confidence in Moldova\u2019s ability to manage these foreign influence threats and have closely followed Moldovan government actions to thwart these efforts, including during the campaign period. For months, the U.S. government, the Moldovan government, the Moldovan security services, and other allies and partners have warned that Russia is seeking to undermine Moldovan democratic institutions in the lead-up to the presidential election and referendum on Moldova\u2019s EU membership.\n\nThe U.S. government and the Government of Moldova have worked hand-in-hand to expose Russian influence efforts, and sanction those involved. We are taking a range of measures to support those efforts as part of our partnership with Moldova and its people. The United States will continue to support Moldova and the Moldovan people, and to expose and counter Russian efforts to undermine Moldovan democracy.",

        "text": "US presidential election: How states have voted since 1924\nAs the election nears, the US is once again confronting questions about the Electoral College system. A candidate needs 270 electoral votes to win, and a mere handful of swing states determine the outcome.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWith the US presidential election almost here, the debate on the Electoral College system has flared up again.\n\nThe president is chosen every four years not just by the electorate but indirectly via the college, a system established by the framers of the Constitution.\n\nIn modern elections, a candidate must obtain a minimum of 270 electoral votesfrom the states to claim victory. The framers set it up to give more power to the states, and as a compromise to avoid having Congress decide the winner.\n\nAs a result, the story of past presidential elections is most effectively illustrated through state-by-state breakdowns.\n\nBelow, you can see the balance of each state's popular vote in every election since 1924. Blue represents the Democrats, red the Republicans, and the top bar the total votes for other parties or individual candidates.\n\n(Note that Hawaii and Alaska only became states in 1959, while the District of Columbia has only had electoral votes since the 1964 election).\n\nAs seen in the chart below, some states are remarkably uncompetitive. In South Dakota, for example, Democrats have won it in only 5 presidential elections since the state was admitted to the union in 1889.\n\nStates such as Maryland, Minnesota and Massachusetts are Democratic strongholds, while Republicans have become dominant in much of the southeast and in western states.\n\nWhile the Democrats have fewer states firmly in their column, those they do count on collectively carry a high number of electoral votes. Conversely, while Republicans reliably run up huge margins in states like Wyoming and Idaho, those are among the least populous states in the country and thus carry less weight in the electoral college.\n\nThis means the Republicans have to keep a large number of states on side while peeling as many states away from the Democrats as possible in order to win \u2014 and in recent years, medium-sized \"purple\" states like Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina have begun trending the Democrats' way, with little sign that strongly blue states are moving in the other direction.",

        "text": "IDJC\u2019s ElectionGraph: Surge in Negative Ads After Summer Assassination Attempt\nMedia, Law & Policy\n\nThe number of negative ads on Facebook and Instagram in the U.S. presidential race surged after a July assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump despite calls from both major parties to tone down heated rhetoric, according a new ElectionGraph report. Trump\u2019s own ads played a significant role in the shift.\n\nResearchers also found continued patterns of \u201ccoordinated inauthentic behavior\u201d among some outside organizations, including a large network of Facebook pages running ads aimed at scamming the public. The analysis found an estimated $5 million spent on ads that are potential scams, or roughly 4% of the overall ad spending by outside organizations. This translates into about 234 million impressions.\n\nThese are among the findings in the third quarterly report from the ElectionGraph project at the University\u2019s Institute for Democracy, Journalism and Citizenship (IDJC). The report examines ads on Meta platforms, which include Facebook and Instagram, mentioning primary and general election presidential candidates between Sept. 1, 2023, and Aug. 31, 2024.\n\nThe latest report found the Democratic ticket (Biden-Harris, then Harris-Walz) outspending the Trump campaign 10-to-1\u2014or roughly $50 million to $5 million\u2014on Facebook and Instagram between September 2023 and August 2024. That gap expanded to 12-to-1 in the crucial swing state of Pennsylvania. But Trump outpaced Biden\u2019s and Harris\u2019 campaigns combined by about 5-to-1 in ads categorized as \u201cuncivil.\u201d\n\nThe data shows a 4-to-1 difference in impressions on the social media platforms, or about 1 billion impressions for the Democratic ticket compared with 250 million impressions for the GOP. This gap doesn\u2019t take into account Trump-related spending on messaging on social platform X, Trump\u2019s Truth Social network or other media platforms.\n\nIn addition to campaigns\u2019 spending, nearly 3,500 Facebook pages from outside organizations have spent $55 million over the past year in an effort to influence the public this election season.\n\nElectionGraph seeks to identify misinformation trends in the U.S. presidential election and other top 2024 contests. The project is supported by a grant and use of analytics software from Neo4j, the world\u2019s leading graph database and analytics company.\n\nThe ElectionGraph team\u2019s efforts include pinpointing origins of messages and tracing misinformation by collecting and algorithmically classifying ads run on Facebook and Instagram. ElectionGraph also has developed a publicly accessible dashboard to explore its findings.\n\nWhile Meta allows approved organizations to access ad data, such data is not required to be made available\u2014and is not similarly trackable\u2014on TikTok, Google, YouTube or Snapchat. The findings nevertheless provide a framework to visualize the fire hose of information and misinformation targeting voters from groups with a jumble of motives, ties and trustworthiness ahead of the 2024 elections.\n\nThe Institute for Democracy, Journalism and Citizenship is a joint University initiative of the Newhouse School of Public Communications and the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs.\n\n\u201cMy concern with the ongoing scams running on Facebook and Instagram is that they look like legitimate advertisements, but they are full of falsehoods and even deepfakes, further polluting the information environment and deceiving voters,\u201d says Jennifer Stromer-Galley, a professor in the School of Information Studies and ElectionGraph\u2019s lead researcher.\n\nSocial media scams that exploit heightened sentiments during important moments like elections have become widespread, says Jim Webber, chief scientist at Neo4j.\n\n\u201cThis important research, enabled by Neo4j, can help voters and policymakers to distinguish legitimate actors from malicious ones hidden within complex networks,\u201d Webber says. \u201cWithout this technology, achieving such insights would be almost impossible.\u201d\n\nAdds IDJC Kramer Director Margaret Talev: \u201cReal, bipartisan concerns about election-related violence\u2014accentuated by assassination attempts against former President Trump\u2014have proved no match for the magnetic pull of negative, uncivil and attack-ad campaigning that Trump himself and his rivals consider too useful to set aside.\u201d Talev is a journalist and professor of practice in the Newhouse School.",

        "text": "Jimmy Carter has voted in presidential election, representatives confirm\nJimmy Carter, the centenarian former Democratic president, has voted in the 2024 presidential election, his representatives confirmed on Wednesday.\n\nA statement from the Carter Center did not reveal who he voted for, but it is assumed the 100-year-old, who is in hospice care, cast his ballot for the Democratic candidate Kamala Harris.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s never voted Republican in his life,\u201d his son, Chip, told the Atlanta Journal Constitution, after revealing in August that Carter\u2019s greatest wish, more than reaching his 100th birthday, was to live long enough to support her.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m only trying to make it to vote for Kamala Harris,\u201d he said at the time.\n\nAt the Democratic national convention in August, just weeks before Carter\u2019s 1 October birthday, his grandson Jason, the Carter Center chair, told delegates that the former president believed Harris \u201ccarries my grandfather\u2019s legacy\u201d.\n\nThe statement issued on Wednesday at lunchtime was brief: \u201cThe Carter Center can confirm that former US President Jimmy Carter voted by mail today, Oct 16, 2024. We do not have any further details to share at this time.\u201d\n\nSome media outlets earlier reported falsely that Carter, whose single term of office was 1977 to 1981, had already voted on Tuesday\u2019s first day of early voting in Georgia.\n\nDon\u2019t miss important US election coverage. Get our free app and sign up for election alerts\n\nThe Journal Constitution, confirming the correct details on Wednesday, said Carter filled out his ballot and it was placed in a drop box at the Sumter county courthouse near his hometown of Plains this morning.\n\nCarter has been \u201can especially reliable voter\u201d over the years, the New York Times reported on Wednesday. The newspaper said he had routinely cast ballots in general elections as well as primary runoffs and special elections. For more than a decade, he has voted exclusively by mail in elections tracked by the state, it said.\n\nAccording to Jason Carter, his grandfather, the 39th US president, was in August \u201cmore alert and interested in politics and the war in Gaza\u201d. He has been in hospice care since February 2023, nine months before the death of his wife, the former first lady Rosalynn Carter.\n\nThe move was widely believed to be an indication that Carter was nearing the end of his life, a perception reinforced by his decision to ask Joe Biden to deliver his eulogy the following month.\n\nBiden then suggested he might have provided that information unintentionally, telling reporters: \u201cExcuse me, I shouldn\u2019t say that,\u201d before adding Carter\u2019s medical team had \u201cfound a way to keep him going for a lot longer than they anticipated\u201d.\n\nThe ultimate elder statesman of US politics, Carter became the first president in history to reach 100 years old, a milestone celebrated a couple of weeks before his birthday at a star-studded party in Atlanta.\n\n\u201cNot everyone gets 100 years. But when someone does and uses that time to good, it\u2019s worth celebrating,\u201d Jason Carter, the 2014 Democratic nominee for Georgia governor, said.\n\nAfter losing to the Republican Ronald Reagan in the 1980 election and leaving the White House, Carter dedicated himself to diplomacy, and was regularly provided counsel to subsequent presidents dealing with international crises.\n\nHe was awarded the Nobel peace prize in 2002 \u201cfor his decades of untiring effort to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights, and to promote economic and social development\u201d.\n\nHe founded the Carter Center in 1982 with the intention it become a leading advocate for advancing human rights globally and alleviating famine, poverty and suffering.",

        "text": "Team Pennsylvania and Clean Air Task Force convene leaders to discuss challenges, opportunities of industrial decarbonization\nFeatured speakers from U.S. Department of Energy, Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection provide policy briefing on the current regulatory landscape\n\nPITTSBURGH, PA \u2013 More than 100 leaders from business, industry, labor, higher education and nonprofit organizations convened today for a roundtable on industrial decarbonization, held by Team PA and Clean Air Task Force (CATF) at the Energy Innovation Center in downtown Pittsburgh. The forum included keynotes by senior leaders from the United States Department of Energy and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, who provided an update on Pennsylvania\u2019s implementation of $400 million in federal investment to address pollution from small, medium, and large industrial facilities through the RISE PA grant program. Executives from private industry also discussed the challenges and opportunities in reducing industrial emissions.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re making real progress on the ground. For greater Pittsburgh and the state of Pennsylvania where traditional manufacturing has played such an important historic role, there is greater comfort with this type of development and a broader appreciation of the need for the energy transition to work for everyone,\u201d said Assistant Secretary Brad Crabtree for Fossil Energy and Carbon Management at DOE. \u201cNow, with the path forward much clearer than in the past, and our policy tools much more robust and comprehensive than before, Pennsylvania has the potential to lead our nation\u2019s industrial decarbonization agenda to the benefit of our climate and the region\u2019s economy, workers and communities.\u201d\n\n\u201cReducing emissions from the industrial sector is critical to achieve state and national climate goals, drive economic and job growth, and improve public health for communities. As one of the largest energy producers in the country with a legacy of driving American industry forward, Pennsylvania is well positioned to lead in the clean energy transition,\u201d said John Carlson, Senior Northeast Regional Policy Manager at CATF. \u201cWe look forward to continuing our work together to expand the clean energy portfolio in the state to reduce emissions and bolster the energy workforce in Pennsylvania.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndustrial decarbonization is not a solo activity. As an organization focused on collaboration, we are honored to convene so many tremendous leaders this week in Pittsburgh,\u201d Abby Smith, President & CEO of Team PA, said. \u201cCreating economic opportunity across all of Pennsylvania while advancing sustainability and industrial decarbonization will require all of us to work together outside the political fray, where policymakers hear from those who are on the ground building Pennsylvania\u2019s economy and where leaders from across the state\u2019s industries learn from one other.\u201d\n\n\u201cPennsylvania was one of the birthplaces of the Industrial Revolution, and now, through RISE PA, we have the opportunity to lead the nation in the industrial decarbonization movement,\u201d said Louie Krak, director of PA DEP\u2019s Infrastructure Implementation program.\n\nPress Contacts:\n\nKevin Sunday, Team PA, [email protected], (717) 487-3571\n\nSamantha Sadowski, CATF, [email protected], (202) 440-1717\n\nU.S. Department of Energy, [email protected]",

        "text": "Record turnout in Georgia state as early voting begins in US election\nGeorgia is one of several key battleground states set to decide the US presidential election, with the early turnout showing voter enthusiasm.\n\nThe state of Georgia has reported a record turnout on the first day of early voting in the United States elections, revealing a high level of engagement in the key battleground state.\n\nHours after polls opened in the southern state on Tuesday, election officials reported that more than 251,000 voters had already cast their ballot in person.\n\nOne of several races on the ballot is the high-profile showdown for the White House: Vice President Kamala Harris \u2014 the Democratic presidential candidate \u2014 is set to face off against her Republican rival, former President Donald Trump.\n\nTuesday\u2019s voter tally in Georgia blew away the state\u2019s previous record for the first day of in-person early voting, set in 2020. That year saw 133,000 residents show up to vote.\n\n\u201cAs of 4pm [ET] we have crossed the quarter million mark with 251,899 votes cast. Spectacular turnout. We are running out of adjectives for this,\u201d Gabriel Sterling, the chief operating officer for the Office of the Georgia Secretary of State, posted on X.\n\nHistorically, large turnouts for early voting have favoured Democrats, although both parties have been urging voters to go to the polls early in states where it is allowed.\n\nUS presidential elections are ultimately determined through a weighted voting system called the Electoral College.\n\nEach state has a certain number of Electoral College votes to award, and most grant those votes in a winner-takes-all system: Whichever candidate wins the state \u2014 no matter how small the margin \u2014 receives all the Electoral College votes.\n\nGeorgia, with its 16 Electoral College votes, is one of seven tightly-fought \u201cswing states\u201d, which could lean either Democrat or Republican this election cycle. Other battleground states include Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona, Nevada and North Carolina.\n\nClose races in those states could determine who becomes the next president.\n\nEyes on Georgia\n\nTuesday\u2019s tally has been interpreted as a sign of voter enthusiasm, particularly as the presidential race enters its final stretch. Election day \u2014 the final opportunity to cast a ballot \u2014 is set for November 5.\n\nBoth Harris\u2019s and Trump\u2019s campaigns have set their sights on winning Georgia. Trump rallied in its capital, Atlanta, on Tuesday, and Harris is set to hold her own event in the city on Saturday.\n\nIn 2020, President Joe Biden became the first Democrat to win the state since 1992, a victory largely attributed to a huge uptick in Black voting. Black residents account for about one-third of Georgia\u2019s population.\n\nBut with a margin of victory of just 11,779, the state also became a key lever in Trump\u2019s campaign to overturn Biden\u2019s victory.\n\nIn the wake of the 2020 election, Trump infamously pressured Georgia\u2019s top election official to \u201cfind\u201d more votes, and he actively spread misinformation that the ballot tally was marred by election fraud.\n\nThe Republican leader was subsequently indicted on state racketeering charges in relation to his alleged efforts to overturn the vote.\n\nThe pending case, led by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, will not go to trial before the 2024 election. Nevertheless, recent polls show Harris and Trump remain locked in a neck-and-neck race in the state.\n\nSome Democrats fear that an apparent softening in Black voters\u2019 support for Harris could help tip the race.\n\nWhile Black residents overwhelmingly support Democratic candidates, a recent poll from The New York Times and Siena College showed Harris polling at lower levels than Biden did in 2020.\n\nIn turn, Trump\u2019s campaign has increasingly sought to appeal to Black voters, whom critics say Democrats have taken for granted.\n\nTrump\u2019s claim that migrants are taking \u201cBlack jobs\u201d has become a mainstay of his stump speech.\n\nHarris has also made a concerted effort to appeal more to Black men. Earlier this week, she released a policy plan that would include giving forgivable business loans to Black entrepreneurs, more support for studying diseases that disproportionately affect African-American men and legalising marijuana on the federal level.\n\n\u201cBlack men have long felt that too often their voice in our political process has gone unheard and that there is so much untapped ambition and leadership within the Black male community,\u201d the Harris campaign said upon releasing the proposal.\n\nCourt ruling\n\nMeanwhile, questions about the validity of Georgia\u2019s election proceedings, fuelled by Trump\u2019s false claims of fraud, have continued to hang over the state\u2019s vote.\n\nOn Monday, Fulton County Superior Judge Robert McBurney ruled that local election board members could not refuse to certify election results in any situation.\n\nThat came in response to a local election board member\u2019s request that the court rule that the certification is discretionary.\n\nThe request stoked concerns that some election board members \u2014 particularly those who have cast doubt on the 2020 results \u2014 would refuse to certify results in their counties.\n\nSuch a refusal would have wide-ranging implications in an election that could come down to just a handful of votes.\n\nMcBurney also blocked a new Georgia State Election Board rule that would have required districts to hand-count ballots.\n\nElection experts have warned the approach is actually less accurate than machine counting and could create long waits for a final tally. That, in turn, could help to fuel doubt and conspiracy theories about the election results.",

        "text": "Harris slams Trump in Pennsylvania as US election race heats up\nHarris says second Trump term would be \u2018dangerous\u2019 as presidential candidates hold duelling rallies in key swing state.\n\nUS Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris has accused her Republican rival Donald Trump of being a threat to democracy, as the pair held duelling rallies in the critical battleground state of Pennsylvania.\n\nHarris and Trump addressed their respective supporters on Monday evening, with Harris speaking in the city of Erie and Trump hosting a town hall in Oaks, a suburb northwest of Philadelphia.\n\n\u201cA second Trump term would be a huge risk for America \u2013 and dangerous. Donald Trump is increasingly unstable and unhinged,\u201d Harris told the crowd, referencing recent comments in which Trump warned that the United States faced an \u201cenemy from within\u201d.\n\nTrump has leaned into increasingly incendiary rhetoric as the race for the White House heats up ahead of the November 5 vote.\n\nThe former president has adopted dehumanising rhetoric about immigrants, and he also recently suggested the country faced internal enemies who could be addressed with military force.\n\n\u201cI think the bigger problem is the enemy from within,\u201d he told Fox News in an interview that aired at the weekend when asked about potential chaos on Election Day. \u201cWe have some very bad people. We have some sick people, radical left lunatics.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cIt should be very easily handled by, if necessary, by [the] National Guard, or if really necessary, by the military.\u201d\n\nTrump also has previously shared content on his social media platform suggesting that his political opponents were traitors who should face military tribunals.\n\nFor years, Democrats have sought to portray Trump as a threat to US democracy, particularly after a mob of his supporters stormed the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, in an effort to prevent Congress from certifying the 2020 election results.\n\nPresident Joe Biden \u2013 who defeated Trump in that 2020 vote \u2013 said last year that the ex-president\u2019s Make America Great Again (MAGA) campaign was an \u201cextremist movement that does not share the basic beliefs in our democracy\u201d.\n\nBut recent polls suggest Trump and Harris are locked in an extremely tight race for the White House, less than a month before the election.\n\nIn recent weeks, Harris has been on a media blitz as her campaign pushes to appeal to key segments of the Democratic base, including Black men as well as Arab and Muslim Americans who have shown waning support for the candidate.\n\nAt her rally on Monday, she showed clips of Trump\u2019s most recent comments as she warned against electing him to another term.\n\n\u201cHe considers anyone who doesn\u2019t support him, or who will not bend to his will, an enemy of our country,\u201d the US vice president said.\n\nPolling averages show Harris with a narrow lead of less than 1 percent in Pennsylvania, a northeastern state that could prove critical in the upcoming election.\n\nFor his part, during his event in the Pennsylvania town of Oaks, Trump repeated a pledge to increase US oil drilling, which he said would drive down costs though domestic production is already at record highs.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to drill baby drill. We\u2019re going to have so much energy and we\u2019re going to bring prices down,\u201d Trump said.\n\nAfter medical incidents in the crowd interrupted his town hall, the Republican candidate requested that the song Ave Maria be played for the audience.\n\n\u201cThose two people who went down are patriots,\u201d Trump said afterwards. \u201cWe love them. And because of them, we ended up with some great music, right?\u201d",

        "text": "US Presidential Election 2024: Kamala Harris holds slim lead over Donald Trump in three new national poll surveys\nThree latest national poll surveys indicate that Vice President Kamala Harris is maintaining a slim lead over former President Donald Trump as the two prepare for the upcoming US presidential election on November 5.\n\nMarist College Poll: Harris leads Trump by 5 points among likely voters (52% to 47%) A Marist College survey shows Harris leading Trump by five points among likely voters, with 52 per cent support compared to Trump\u2019s 47 per cent. This represents a shift from earlier polling this month, which indicated a two-point margin between the candidates.\n\nHowever, the race tightens when considering registered voters, where Harris holds a narrow 51 per cent to 48 per cent lead. Trump shows strength among independent voters, capturing 54 per cent compared to Harris\u2019s 44 per cent. The dynamics of the race also reveal stark differences among demographic groups, with Harris enjoying a significant advantage among women (57 per cent to 42 per cent) and younger voters, while Trump leads among men (53 per cent to 47 per cent).\n\nAmong Generation X voters, Harris leads with 51 per cent compared to Trump\u2019s 48 per cent. Harris also enjoys significant support among younger voters, with 53 per cent of Gen Z and Millennials favouring her.\n\nNew Marquette Law School Poll: Harris leads Trump by a narrow 1% margin In a separate Marquette Law School national poll, survey reveals a tightly contested race for the presidency between Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris and former Republican President Donald Trump. The polls were conducted from October 1-10, 2024.\n\nHarris is favoured by 48 per cent of likely voters, with Trump close behind at 47 per cent. When factoring in other potential candidates, such as Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Jill Stein, Harris's lead narrows further, demonstrating the competitiveness of the race. In this scenario, Harris garners 44 per cent of the vote, while Trump follows closely with 41 per cent.\n\nWhen respondents who are undecided or leaning toward other candidates are forced to choose between Harris and Trump, the race tightens, with both candidates receiving 50 per cent support among likely voters.\n\nIn congressional races, the poll shows that 51 per cent of likely voters prefer Democratic candidates, while 49 per cent lean toward Republican candidates.\n\nWhen asked who they believe is more likely to win the upcoming election, 53 per cent of respondents think Harris will definitely or probably win, compared to 47 per cent who believe Trump will have the upper hand.\n\nReuters/Ipsos Poll: Harris holds 3-point lead over Trump (45% to 42%) A recent Reuters/Ipsos poll has revealed a closely contested race for the presidency, with Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris holding a marginal 3-percentage-point lead over former Republican President Donald Trump. Kamala Harris leads Donald Trump by a narrow margin of 45 per cent to 42 per cent among likely voters.",

At the end of August, Vice President Harris had leads large enough in three of the seven states for them to lean in her direction, according to an NPR analysis of polling averages at the time.\n\nNow, Trump has taken over the lead in an average of the polls in the seven swing states for the first time since Harris got in the race.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nSurveys in the past couple of weeks have moved in Trump\u2019s direction, and the leads Harris had in the most competitive and critical states have mostly evaporated. Everything is still within the margin of error and incredibly close \u2014 just 0.34 percentage points separate Trump and Harris. But the consistency of the change \u2014 and the fact that it\u2019s all in Trump\u2019s direction \u2014 has Democrats concerned.\n\nLoading...\n\nWhen President Biden dropped out of the race and Harris stepped in, Democratic enthusiasm went up, and the trajectory of the race moved in her direction. But since then, Trump\u2019s team has gone intensely negative, looking to drag Harris\u2019 numbers down.\n\nThe Harris campaign maintains that the race has been close all along, that they always expected a close race, and there hasn\u2019t been much movement, with the exception of Harris\u2019 entry.\n\nIn 2016 and 2020, surveys in the presidential election overstated Democrats\u2019 standing. Even though Biden won in 2020, he had been leading by more in many swing state polls than what the final result showed. Does that mean Trump will win this election? Maybe. Or have the pollsters corrected errors, making this more of a true coin-flip race? That\u2019s possible, too.\n\nPolls also understated Democrats\u2019 support in the 2022 midterms. Of course, Trump wasn\u2019t on the ballot then.\n\nGiven that these contests are all well within the margins of error, mobilization of key voting groups is the most important thing at this point for both sides, as early voting has kicked off in some places with many more states joining them in the coming days.\n\nBecause all of the seven swing states are within the margin of error, they remain a toss-up in NPR\u2019s \u201canalysis\u201d map (Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada). That\u2019s not based strictly on polling, but historical trends and conversations with campaigns and party strategists.\n\nLoading...\n\nThe \u201cpolling map\u201d is based on the average of two polling aggregators \u2014 FiveThirtyEight and DDHQ/The Hill. If a candidate has a lead of 1 point or more in each of them, then a state is moved to Lean D or R. If not, they are Toss-ups.\n\nNeither candidate is yet favored to win in enough states to put them at or over the 270 electoral votes needed to win, with three weeks to go until voting ends.",

        "text": "As the presidential campaign goes viral, so, too, does misinformation\nThe 2024 election season has been unprecedented by almost every measure.\n\nPresident Joe Biden dropping out of the race less than four months before Election Day. The meteoric rise of Vice President Kamala Harris as the new Democratic presidential candidate. Two failed assassination attempts on former President Donald Trump. Accusations of AI-generated crowd sizes. And thousands and thousands of cat memes.\n\nFor anyone who closely studies U.S. elections, this cycle has proven rife with opportunities to explore new facets of political culture, including how meme makers, social media influencers, AI technologies and misinformation are shaping campaigns, affecting voter turnout, and even potentially delegitimizing the election results when they do come in next month.\n\nMoody College of Communication journalism assistant professor Jo Lukito and her team at the Center for Media Engagement, which researches media ethics and propaganda, look at all these factors in their work.\n\nFor Lukito, it\u2019s a labor that is equal parts exciting and terrifying.\n\n\u201cEverything is moving super, super fast,\u201d she said in September. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to keep up, and we\u2019ve had to change course quite a bit.\u201d\n\nSince her September interview, the southeastern U.S. was hit with catastrophic hurricanes, the conflict in the Middle East has escalated to full-on warfare and more documents were released detailing Trump\u2019s involvement in the Jan. 6 insurrection.\n\nThe world\u2019s eyes are fixed on the political stage.\n\n\u201cThis election is a really good time to talk about politics because many folks are getting more involved. I feel like there's a lot of engagement,\u201d Lukito said. \u201cBut I think the part that makes me anxious is just how much distrust people have in the media system.\u201d",

Alex Brandon/AP\n\nFormer President Donald Trump responded to Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 calls for him to release his medical records after she released a summary of hers over the weekend, saying the vice president \u201cis dying to see my Cholesterol.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve put out more Medical Exams than any other President in History,\u201d Trump said on Truth Social, while attacking Harris for parts of her medical history released in the summary provided by her office.\n\nTrump went on to attack Harris\u2019 medical records, saying her history with seasonal allergies and hives were \u201cdeeply serious conditions that clearly impact her functioning.\u201d\n\nHarris blasted Trump for not releasing his medical records during a rally in Greenville, North Carolina, on Sunday, telling the crowd \u201cHe\u2019s not being transparent with the voters. He\u2019s not being transparent. So, check this out \u2014 He refuses to release his medical records. I\u2019ve done it. Every other presidential candidate in modern era has done it. He is unwilling to do 60 Minutes interviews, like every other major party candidate has done for more than half a century. He is unwilling to meet for a second debate.\u201d\n\nThe White House on Saturday released a letter summarizing her medical history from the vice president\u2019s doctor, US Army physician Dr. Joshua R. Simmons, who said Harris is in \u201cexcellent health.\u201d\n\nMore on Harris\u2019 medical history: Harris has seasonal allergies and hives and is nearsighted, Simmons\u2019 letter said. Her immunizations and preventive care screenings are all up to date, and her most recent April physical exam and her routine bloodwork have shown no causes for alarm, according to Simmons.\n\nThe vice president wears contact lenses, takes a vitamin D3 supplement, and at times uses over-the-counter and prescription allergy medications, including Allegra, nasal spray and eye drops, Simmons wrote. Simmons described her diet as \u201cvery healthy,\u201d and said Harris does not use tobacco products and drinks alcohol \u201conly occasionally and in moderation.\u201d\n\nDr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN\u2019s chief medical correspondent, said the letter is \u201cmost notable in some ways\u201d for what it does not show. \u201cNo history of diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, cardiac disease, lung disease, cancer,\u201d Gupta noted, summarizing it as \u201cbasically saying (Harris) is fit for duty.\u201d\n\nFor context: The medical conditions that affect Harris and that Trump pointed out in his Truth Social posts, including urticaria, allergic rhinitis and allergic conjunctivitis, are not considered serious and would not impact someone\u2019s cognition. Urticaria\u2014a skin condition\u2014\u201caffects 20% of people at some time during their lives,\u201d according to the American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.\n\nTrump\u2019s medical history: Trump\u2019s campaign released a letter from his personal physician in November 2023 that described him as being in \u201cexcellent\u201d health, but the letter did not include information about the types of tests that Trump took or what the results were. It notably didn\u2019t include basic information that Trump\u2019s physicians have shared in the past, such as his height and weight, cholesterol level or blood pressure.",

Three in four business leaders in the technology industry expect the outcome of the US election to impact artificial intelligence (AI) regulation, initial public offering (IPO) activity, innovation and innovation .",
        "text": "EY survey reveals upcoming US presidential election will have notable impact on technology sector\nThree in four business leaders in the technology industry (74%) think the results of the upcoming US election will have a major impact on the US tech sector\u2019s ability to stay ahead of global competitors\n\nErnst & Young LLP (EY US) today released its latest technology pulse poll, which examines how technology leaders think the upcoming US election will impact the technology industry. The poll of 500 technology industry leaders, which was conducted in October 2024, reveals that respondents expect the outcome of the US election to impact artificial intelligence (AI) regulation, initial public offering (IPO) activity, innovation and global competitiveness.\n\nTech industry leaders said they plan to significantly increase AI investments in the next 12 months, although they indicate that future progress toward AI growth may be contingent on the outcome of the elections. Specific focus areas of AI investment include hiring AI-specific talent, back-office functions and cybersecurity. As companies look to further develop AI initiatives, there will be a growing need to hire AI-specific talent, while also restructuring and/or reducing legacy job functions in exchange for other in-demand functions.\n\n\n\nNearly three-fourths (74%) of technology industry leaders think the results of the upcoming US election will have a major impact on the US tech sector\u2019s ability to stay ahead of global competition in the next two to four years. Notably, they think that the outcome of the US election would most impact the following areas of regulation: cybersecurity/data protections, AI and machine learning, and user data and content oversight.\n\n\n\nRegardless of the presidential outcome, technology companies will continue significant investment in AI. However, all eyes will be on how election results impact the direction of fiscal, tax, tariff, anti-trust and regulatory policies and the resulting impact on interest rates, mergers and acquisitions, IPOs and AI regulations. Coming off of a sluggish tech market in 2024, the 2025 trajectory is bullish, as companies focus on raising capital to invest in growth and emerging technologies like AI,\u201d says James Brundage, EY Global and Americas Technology Sector Leader.\n\n\n\nOther key findings from the EY survey include:\n\n\n\nTech leaders double down on AI\n\nThe majority of technology leaders (82%) say their company plans to increase AI investments by 50% or more in the next year. The key areas where these leaders report plans to focus AI investment over the next year include AI-specific talent (60%), cybersecurity (49%) and back-office functions (45%). Most tech industry leaders surveyed also say they plan to allocate/reallocate resources toward AI investments in the next 6\u201312 months, with 78% of tech leaders reporting their company is thinking about divesting noncore assets or businesses as part of their growth strategy during that time.\n\nSize hinders AI speed\n\nTech leaders say around 63% of their organization\u2019s AI initiatives have successfully moved to the implementation phase. However, organizations that employ more employees report less success moving AI initiatives to the implementation phase. Among those who indicate that fewer than half of their AI initiatives have been implemented successfully, data quality issues (40%) and talent/skills shortages (34%) are the most common reasons for AI initiatives failing to progress to the next stage.\n\nThe search for AI talent accelerates\n\nAs companies continue to integrate more AI into their businesses, the need to hire AI-specific talent will increase, as well as the need to restructure or reduce headcount from legacy job functions. In fact, 80% of tech leaders surveyed said they foresee reducing or restructuring headcount from legacy functions to other in-demand functions, and 77% anticipate an increase in hiring for AI-specific talent. Additionally, 40% of technology leaders say their company plans to focus next year\u2019s AI investments on human capital efforts such as training.\n\n\u201cAs companies pivot to more investments in AI talent, there are key considerations for tech leaders as they strive to bridge the gap between AI investment and implementation,\u201d says Ken Englund, EY Americas Technology Sector Growth Leader. \u201cThese include hiring talent with both hard and soft skills, offering AI training programs, and upskilling their workforce.\u201d\n\n\n\nSurvey methodology\n\n\n\nEY US commissioned Atomik Research to conduct an online survey of 503 US business leaders working within the technology industry. Participants held roles similar or equivalent to director, vice president, senior vice president, executive vice president, C-suite or president. Business leaders surveyed worked at organizations consisting of 5,000 or more employees. The margin of error is +/- 4 percentage points with a confidence level of 95%. Fieldwork took place between September 27 and October 7, 2024.\n\nAbout EY\n\n\n\nEY exists to build a better working world, helping to create long-term value for clients, people and society and build trust in the capital markets.

        "text": "US faces \u2018challenging\u2019 time as presidential election looms\nNews\n\nBy Ted Simmons\n\nWith the US presidential election forthcoming, Distilled Spirits Council of the US (Discus) and other spirits bodies share the issues they stand to face. From concerns about the possible return of Trump-era tariffs to much-needed support for the hospitality workforce, we temperature check the state of the American spirits industry ahead of voting on 5 November.\n\nAt its annual conference this past March, Discus introduced Cher A Spirit, its candidate for the Cocktail Party, a new initiative launched to band its members together regardless of political affiliation. The US spirits industry is facing a number of issues entering the upcoming presidential election between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, and the notion from Discus and Spirits United is that the industry needs to band together to combat forces like inflation, taxes, tariffs, and the threat of a labour strike.\n\nWith the election less than a month away, Discus president Chris Swonger shares that sentiment once more. \u201cIt\u2019s imperative that the industry comes together, works together, and rises up in support,\u201d Swonger says. \u201cFor us, we are bipartisan, and we\u2019re committed to working with the Harris administration or the Trump administration, and we\u2019ll be strong advocates for this industry whoever wins the White House.\u201d\n\nDiscus is based in Washington DC, and Swonger says the organisation has been monitoring polls both on a national and state level, and doing its best to get a sense of what might happen. For Swonger and Discus, the chief issue of this election remains the hefty tariffs imposed on American whiskey by the EU stemming from the Trump administration\u2019s trade disputes over steel and aluminium. A 25% tariff was suspended in December 2023, but will be reimposed and doubled if a resolution isn\u2019t reached by March 2025.\n\n\u201cWe will be turning on a dime, depending on the results of the election, to quickly work with our European counterparts and the incoming administration to make sure those tariffs that are scheduled to go up on American whiskey either get suspended again, or our hope and aspiration is to get them eliminated all together,\u201d Swonger says.\n\nFormer president Trump has frequently mentioned tariffs on the campaign trail as a means to solve the national deficit, and Swonger says he would anticipate a very aggressive trade posture should he win the presidency once more.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to do everything we can to demonstrate and showcase that distilled spirits products, both here in the United States and overseas are not commodity products,\u201d Swonger adds. \u201cA tariff on American whiskey by our EU partners impacts American jobs and our ability to export, and the same will apply if the US happens to impose a tariff on Cognac. The industry is totally aligned, both in the US and in Europe, in terms of working with the EU and whichever administration comes into power to try to avoid that.\u201d\n\nBeyond the potential EU tariffs, Swonger says Discus is focused on the forthcoming US dietary guidelines, state market modernisation efforts that include access to spirits-based RTDs, and combatting state level spirits taxes like the proposed 287% hike in Nebraska that was shot down in August thanks in part to an effort organised by Discus.\n\n\u201cThis is a challenging, unique time for the industry,\u201d Swonger says. \u201cWe want to make sure that American craft distillers around the country can continue to thrive just like we want our larger companies to thrive too because distilled spirits play such a positive role in society, and support economic vitality in communities around the country.\u201d\n\nCraft spirits\n\nElsewhere within the US spirits industry, the American Craft Spirits Association (ACSA) is focused on keeping businesses open, leveraging opportunities for increased market access, and continued tax relief and other incentives.\n\n\u201cDiscussions with members of both parties indicate they value the economic impact that our small businesses create in rural, urban, and suburban communities throughout the US,\u201d ACSA CEO Margie AS Lehrman says. \u201cWe are cautiously optimistic that we will be able to create the changes we need to move craft spirits from the decreases in value and volume that we have seen in 2023 results back to positive territory over the next year.\u201d\n\nLehrman says her members are struggling with the impact of price increases and the effects of inflation on their customers. Earlier this year, the ACSA traded statements with the Wine and Spirits Wholesalers of America (WSWA) over market access, namely direct-to-consumer (DTC) shipping laws. New York recently joined the shortlist of states that allow DTC shipping.\n\n\u201cThat is a big deal and ACSA hopes other states will see the benefit and follow suit,\u201d Lehrman notes.\n\nExpiration of Trump-era tax cuts\n\nThe WSWA is focused on the potential expiration of Trump-era tax cuts, particularly the 199A tax deduction, which allowed family-owned and small businesses to reinvest in their operations. The provision allows pass-through entities whose income is taxed at the individual tax rate, rather than the lower corporate rate, to deduct certain business expenses.\n\n\u201cIf it expires, wholesalers will be at a significant disadvantage compared to corporations, and we are advocating for its extension to ensure continued growth for small and medium-sized businesses,\u201d WSWA president and CEO Francis Creighton says.\n\nSimilar to Discus, the WSWA is concerned about the return of tariffs on wine and spirits, and it is closely watching each candidate\u2019s trade policies. \u201cA return to Trump-era tariffs could severely impact supply chains, while a Harris administration would likely maintain the status quo,\u201d Creighton added. \u201cNonetheless, we must stay vigilant as global trade dynamics remain unpredictable.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the WSWA is following cannabis regulation closely, as well as supply chain disruptions, such as the ongoing threat of port strikes. The WSWA is actively engaging with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle and emphasising the negative impact tariffs would have on wine and spirits.\n\n\u201cSipSource data indicates ongoing declines in the wine and spirits sectors, with no immediate signs of recovery,\u201d Creighton says. \u201cThese challenges, combined with potential policy shifts, highlight the need for a proactive and strategic approach in the coming months.\u201d\n\nBartenders and over-regulation of alcohol\n\nOn the bartending front, Bo Shuff, executive director of the United States Bartender\u2019s Guild (USBG) says they are facing the same issues as many Americans, namely fair wages, affordable healthcare and housing, and safe working conditions. More specific to bars, Shuff lists over-regulation of alcohol distribution and the difficulties of opening a new nightlife business as key issues.\n\n\u201cWhile many of these issues are decided at the state, local, or even neighbourhood level, it\u2019s encouraging that both presidential candidates are speaking directly to the needs of the hospitality workforce\u201d Shuff notes.\n\n\u201cThe ethics of tip-based compensation, the role of immigration in the hospitality workforce, and the effect of tariffs on the cost of operating bars and restaurants are all complicated and nuanced issues that deeply affect bars and bartenders. But while we are affected by these policies, the bartending community isn\u2019t regularly heard in the conversation. That\u2019s one of the goals of the new USBG Advocacy Committee.\u201d\n\nOn a state level, the USBG is keeping a close eye on two ballot propositions impacting service industry minimum wage. Arizona Ballot Proposition 138 would change how the state\u2019s service industry minimum wage and tip credits are calculated, while Massachusetts Proposition 5 would phase out the tipped minimum wage entirely.\n\nThe general feeling across the American spirits and hospitality sectors is a nervous mix, and nerves will understandably remain until the election polls close on 5 November.\n\nRelated news\n\nDiscus: tariffs on spirits \u2018will hurt US consumers\u2019\n\nHeritage Distilling Co launches IPO\n\nRTD growth in US driven by spirits",

        "text": "Donald Trump: US Presidential Election 2024: Why 7 states can help you rule USA\nGame of Thrones,\n\nsvars\n\nArizona: Biden's narrow win in 2020 is complicated by immigration and abortion being dominant issues. Harris, the Schrodinger's \u2018Border Czar,\u2019 is visiting the state today \u2013 her first trip since becoming the Democratic nominee. It could be a sticky wicket for the Dems. Georgia: Trump faced legal battles over \u201celection interference\u201d here, but the state is crucial. African-American voters backed Biden in 2020, and Harris hopes they\u2019ll support her as well. Michigan: The state\u2019s significant Arab-American population is unhappy with Biden\u2019s Middle East policy. Recently, the mayor of Hamtramck, the only city with an all-Muslim government, endorsed Donald Trump . Nevada: Though the state has voted Democrat since 2008, it\u2019s still considered a swing state despite offering only six electoral votes. The economy and immigration issues make it a battleground for both candidates. North Carolina: The state has been in the news for its lieutenant governor\u2019s controversial comments on a black porn forum, raising concerns that Mark Robinson could jeopardise Trump\u2019s chances. Robinson, heavily backed by Trump for governor, was ignored when Trump recently visited the state. Pennsylvania: Trump is known for his successes here. Democrats had won this state since 1992 until Trump flipped it in 2016. He also survived an assassination attempt, effectively ending Biden\u2019s bid for a second term. Wisconsin: Harris has a slight edge over Trump, but the economy, healthcare, abortion, and crime could create challenges. She leads for now, but can she maintain it?\n\nGame of Thrones\n\nIn the Harry Potter universe \u2013 whose creator is now defined by her gender-bender takes \u2013 the number seven is pivotal. That\u2019s why Lord Voldemort decided to create seven Horcruxes that would have made him immortal, if his sidekick hadn\u2019t fancied the mother of a scrawny git. Seven is a number that frequently recurs in fiction and non-fiction. There are seven kingdoms inseven colours in the rainbow, seven musical notes (), and the number seven graces the backs of iconic sportsmen like MS Dhoni and Eric Cantona.The number seven is equally significant in US elections, where seven swing states can determine the outcome. While swing states may change, for the purposes of this piece, the seven are: Arizona (11), Georgia (16), Michigan (15), Nevada (6), North Carolina (16), Pennsylvania (19), and Wisconsin (10).A candidate needs a majority while battling for 538 electoral college votes. Regardless of the margin of victory, whoever wins a state takes the full electoral college vote count. For example, in Arizona in 2020, Joe Biden won by just 10,457 votes but secured all 11 electoral college votes from the state. It\u2019s possible to win more votes overall, as Clinton did in 2016, and still receive fewer electoral college votes. As NPR \u2019s Domenico Montanaro noted, \u201c44,000 votes in Georgia, Arizona, and Wisconsin\u201d separated Trump and Biden from a tie in the electoral college. Hillary Clinton famously won the popular vote in 2016 but lost in the electoral college.Essentially, these seven states could decide the fate of the realm.Since 1988, 20 states and Washington, DC have consistently voted for the same party in every presidential election, with only a few seeing close battles. Trump\u2019s unexpected victory in 2016 was due to his ability to swing several key states that had previously voted for Democrats, earning him 304 electoral votes to Hillary's 227. Meanwhile, Biden\u2019s ability to reclaim some of these states was crucial to his victory, where he defeated Trump 306-232.Now a disclaimer: given the unprecedented nature of this election \u2013 with a candidate shoehorned in at the last moment after her predecessor lost his bearings, and a former POTUS who has survived two assassination attempts \u2013 all bets are off.With fluctuating polls, any state with less than a 5% gap could be in play. A recent NYT-Sienna College poll suggested Trump\u2019s fortunes were looking up in the so-called Sun Belt swing states of Arizona, North Carolina, and Georgia. However, these polls were taken before the revelations about Trump\u2019s \u2018black Nazi\u2019 Mark Robinson\u2019s candid thoughts on a porn forum, which could reverse Trump\u2019s gains in North Carolina.Here's a quick look at each key state:Overall, Trump and Harris are neck-and-neck in several polls. According to 538, Harris is nationally leading by 2.7 BPS. In the, to sit on the Iron Throne, you had to wade through eight seasons of incest, bloodletting, political chicanery and lots of speeches. It was a rather messy affair at times. Hopefully, it won't get that messy on November 5.The Top 10 Stories:",

Already twice this century, networks have made calls that led to a contested election result, experts noted. Several factors this year make calling election results dicey for news networks, according to Northeastern University experts. AP Photo/Jae C. Hong\n\nWith Donald Trump and Kamala Harris neck and neck in the polls, Northeastern University political experts say the 2024 presidential election could come down to a handful of ballots in one state, and recounts and lengthy court challenges.\n\nOr, experts say, it may be a clear victory for one candidate or the other by 10 p.m. on election night.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a huge range of possibilities,\u201d says Northeastern University polling expert David Lazer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really a coin flip at this point,\u201d adds John Wihbey, associate professor of media innovation and technology at Northeastern.\n\nSo how will we know who wins? The news media.\n\nBut Northeastern University experts say that litigation (both existing and anticipated), political polarization among the electorate, the culture of \u201cscoops,\u201d and the memories of the 2000 and 2020 presidential elections, and claims of political fraud put tremendous pressure on the newsrooms to make a call this year.\n\nAnd that may mean a little bit of a wait on the evening of Nov. 5.\n\n\u201cI think there should be a note of caution, particularly in this election, and not be premature,\u201d Wihbey says. \u201cThere is a really fine balance between making a rigorous, evidence-based call and yet not being premature.\u201d\n\n\n\nMeg Heckman, associate professor of journalism at Northeastern and a journalist with experience making newsroom election calls, concurs.\n\n\u201cSpeed matters, but accuracy and honesty matter more,\u201d Heckman says.\n\nElections are administered by the states, so there is no single U.S government agency or federal commission that tallies results and declares winners. Thus that role falls to the news media, with the Associated Press playing the role of the \u201cdefinitive source.\u201d\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean that other networks will defer to the AP if they feel they can confidently make a call.",

Trump is \u201cunstable\u201d and \u201cunhinged\u201d and would eviscerate democratic norms if given a second White House term, she said. \u201cAmerica must heed this warning\u201d.\n\nIn her interview on Fox News, Harris was asked about the Biden administration\u2019s efforts to tackle illegal immigration at the southern border , and laid the blame on Republicans for failing to pass a border bill . Harris said Trump told Republicans to reject the bill because \u201che preferred to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem.\u201d\n\nIn the Fox interview, Harris singled out Iran when asked which foreign country she considers to be America\u2019s greatest adversary. Baier questioned whether the Biden-Harris administration was \u201cacting like Iran is the number one threat\u201d.\n\nOf Trump, Harris said, \u201cPeople are exhausted with someone who professes to be a leader and who spends full-time demeaning and engaging in personal grievances.\u201d She added, \u201cHe\u2019s not stable.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s running mate, JD Vance answered \u201cno\u201d when asked if Trump lost the 2020 election, at a Pennsylvania rally. \u201cWhat message do you think it sends to independent voters when you do not directly answer the question \u2018Did Donald Trump lose in 2020?\u2019\u201d the reporter asked, eliciting boos from the crowd. Vance said, \u201cNo. I think there were serious problems in 2020\u201d.\n\nTrump doubled down on his controversial comments about \u201cthe enemy from within\u201d made over the weekend. Before an all-female audience in Cumming, Georgia, Trump mocked Kamala Harris and her allies as \u201csick\u201d, \u201cevil\u201d and \u201ca party of soundbites\u201d. He said, \u201cThey\u2019re very dangerous. They\u2019re Marxists and communists and fascists,\u201d Trump told the Fox News anchor Harris Faulkner. \u201cThey\u2019re the threat to democracy.\u201d\n\nThe former director of Project 2025, a conservative plan to overhaul the US government, has blamed \u201cviolent rhetoric\u201d from his former boss Kevin Roberts , the president of the Heritage Foundation thinktank, for the blueprint\u2019s downgrading as Trump has sought to publicly distance himself from it.\n\nIn Trump\u2019s Univision town hall he was asked to name three virtues possessed by Harris, which he did, before again attacking her. He said that \u201cshe seems to have an ability to survive\u201d, that \u201cshe seems to have some pretty longtime friendships\u201d and that \u201cshe seems to have a nice way about her\u201d. \u201cI mean, I like the way some of her statements, some of her \u2013 the way she behaves, in a certain way. But in another way, I think it\u2019s very bad for our country,\u201d he said.\n\nElsewhere on the campaign trail\n\nA Georgia judge has declared that seven new election rules recently passed by the state election board are \u201cillegal, unconstitutional and void\u201d. Fulton county superior court judge Thomas Cox issued the order on Wednesday after holding a hearing on challenges to the rules. The rules that Cox invalidated included three that had garnered a lot of attention \u2013 one that required that the number of ballots be hand-counted after the close of polls and two that had to do with the certification of election results.\n\nJimmy Carter, the centenarian former Democratic president, has voted in the 2024 presidential election, his representatives confirmed on Wednesday. A statement from the Carter Center did not reveal who he voted for, but it is assumed the 100-year-old, who is in hospice care, cast his ballot for the Democratic candidate Kamala Harris.\n\nAlabama cannot remove thousands of people from its voter rolls on the eve of the presidential election, a federal judge ruled on Wednesday . The US district judge Anna Manasco, an appointee of Donald Trump, issued a preliminary injunction halting an effort by Alabama\u2019s top election official to try to remove more than 3,200 people from the voter rolls who it suspected of being non-citizens until at least after the presidential election.\n\nThe League of Women Voters of Wisconsin has called on the Department of Justice to investigate text messages they say targeted and tried to discourage young people from voting in the November election. The League of Women Voters says it initially learned of the alleged text campaign on 10 October, when the group received numerous complaints from voters who had received the text. Two people in their 20s who work with the League of Women Voters also received the message, which reads: \u201cWARNING: Violating WI Statutes 12.13 & 6.18 may result in fines up to $10,000 or 3.5 years in prison. Don\u2019t vote in a state where you\u2019re not eligible.\u201d\n\nRead more about the 2024 US election:",

        "text": "Trump vs Harris: Who is leading in US election polls?\nAl Jazeera tracks the latest polls with less than three weeks to go before US voters choose a new president on November 5.\n\nThis page is now closed. To stay updated on the latest polls, please click here.\n\nThe US election campaign is in its final weeks with voters heading to the polls on November 5 to elect the next president.\n\nWith less than three weeks to go until the election, Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris and Republican former President Donald Trump are battling it out to sway undecided voters.\n\nHowever, the popular vote does not decide the winner. Instead, it determines which electors will represent each state in the Electoral College, which does pick the president.\n\nTo win, a candidate needs to secure 270 of the 538 electoral votes up for grabs. Electoral College votes are distributed across states according to their relative populations.\n\nWho is in the lead?\n\nAccording to FiveThirtyEight\u2019s daily election poll tracker, as of October 22, Harris is leading in the national polls and has a 1.9-percentage-point lead over Trump.\n\nIn July, President Joe Biden, a Democrat, exited the presidential race and endorsed Harris as his replacement. Since then, the vice president\u2019s ratings have risen from what had been lower numbers under Biden.\n\nWhich states could swing the presidential election?\n\nSwing states, also known as battleground states, can sway the outcome of a national election.\n\nOne of the defining characteristics of a swing state is its ambiguous political leanings where no party has overwhelming support.\n\nThis year, the states being closely watched are Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nIn the 2020 presidential election, Georgia flipped from Republican red to Democratic blue after nearly three decades of voting Republican, and in Arizona, the Democrats won by a narrow margin of 0.3 percentage points.\n\nPolls show Trump and Harris in a narrow race in swing states. Polling in these states is more important in determining the winner than national polling because the Electoral College and not the popular vote chooses the president.\n\nWhat happens if Harris and Trump end in a tie?\n\nThere are a total of 538 electoral votes. To win the election, a candidate must get 270.\n\nGiven the nature of how electoral votes are distributed, specific combinations of states could lead to a tie of 269 votes. Such a scenario is possible, though not probable.\n\nIf no candidate wins at least 270 electoral votes, a contingent election takes place in which the US House of Representatives decides the winner.\n\nEach state\u2019s delegation in the House would cast one vote, and a candidate must receive a majority (26 out of 50) of the state delegation votes to win.\n\nThe US Senate would then choose the vice president with each senator casting one vote and a simple majority (51 votes) required to win.\n\nHow do polls work?\n\nElection polls predict how the population might vote by surveying a sample of voters. Surveys are most commonly conducted by phone or online. In some cases, it is via post or in person.\n\nPoll trackers, which aggregate a number of polls together, are weighted based on a number of factors, such as the sample size of the poll, the pollster quality, how recently the poll was conducted and the particular methodologies employed.\n\nHow accurate are polls?\n\nPolls are never 100 percent accurate. Both the 2016 and 2020 US elections saw opinion polls underestimate the popularity of Republican candidates. Despite polling for the 2022 midterms being more accurate, many still remain sceptical about polling results.\n\nPart of the reason for inaccuracy in polls in recent years is related to the ability to reach voters. Often polls are conducted via telephone surveys; however, fewer people are inclined to answer calls. Nonresponse bias is another reason for inaccuracy \u2013 for example, in recent years, Trump voters have chosen not to respond to polls. Additionally, changes in voter turnout have affected the accuracy of polls, for example, in 2020 voter turnout was much higher than expected.\n\nA mathematical margin of error is implicit in polls because they use small, select groups of people to ascertain the choice of a larger population. That margin of error in US polls indicates the range within which the actual result is likely to fall. With a 1,000-person sample size, the margin of error is about plus or minus 3 percent.\n\nMany of the polls conducted before this year\u2019s presidential election have shown the difference in support between Harris and Trump within the margin of error.",

        "text": "Key facts about union members and the 2024 election\n(Left) A union worker attends the Democratic National Convention in Chicago on Aug. 22, 2024. (Right) Guests hold signs during a campaign rally for former President Donald Trump held at an automotive parts manufacturer in Clinton Township, Michigan, on Sept. 27, 2023. (Kevin Dietsch and Scott Olson/Getty Images)\n\nLong seen as a core constituency of the Democratic Party, voters who belong to labor unions are increasingly being courted by both political parties. In this year\u2019s presidential election, the campaigns of former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris have made high-profile efforts to win the support of union members. And union workers are a crucial voting bloc in several battleground states that will likely determine who wins the White House.\n\nHere are five facts about unions and union members, drawn from recent Pew Research Center surveys and federal data.\n\nHow we did this Pew Research Center conducted this analysis to summarize key facts about union members and Americans\u2019 views about unions ahead of the 2024 presidential election. We used data from Center surveys as well as federal data sources to provide insights into union members\u2019 views, such as their party affiliation and vote choice. This data also highlights how Americans view declining union membership and the effect of labor unions on society. Links to these data sources are available in the text. The links to the Center surveys include information about the questions used, sample sizes and other methodological details.\n\nThe majority of union members align with the Democratic Party. About six-in-ten voters who belong to a union (59%) identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party, while about four-in-ten (39%) associate with the GOP, according to 2023 Center survey data.\n\nHalf of union voters say they would support Harris if the election were held today and 43% say they would support Trump, though this gap is within the survey\u2019s margin of error. Another 6% favor a third-party candidate.\n\nVoters who do not belong to a union are about equally likely to align with either party. And they are equally divided in their presidential vote preferences: 47% would vote for Trump, while 47% would choose Harris. Another 5% would back a third-party candidate.\n\nThe share of U.S. workers who belong to a union has fallen over the past four decades. In 1983, 20.1% of American workers were represented by a union. By 2023, 10.0% of U.S. workers were in a union, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nAs of 2023, union membership was much higher among workers employed in the public sector than the private sector (32.5% vs. 6.0%).\n\nUnionization rates are the lowest in the Southeast and highest in the Northeast, Alaska and Hawaii. A Pew Research Center analysis in 2020 found that 3.1% of workers in North Carolina and 2.9% in South Carolina were unionized, compared with 22.0% in New York, 17.8% in Rhode Island, 17.7% in Alaska and 23.7% in Hawaii.\n\nMajorities of Americans say declining union membership is bad for the country (54%) and for working people (59%), according to a January 2024 Center survey.\n\nDemocrats are more likely than Republicans to view the decline in union membership as bad.\n\n69% of Democrats say the decline has been bad for the country, and 74% say it has been bad for working people.\n\n40% of Republicans say the decline has been bad for the country, and 43% say it has been bad for workers.\n\nLike voters overall, voters who belong to unions are more likely to say Harris\u2019 policies would be better for union members than Trump\u2019s. While 38% of voters overall say Harris\u2019 policies would make things better for union members, 28% say this about Trump\u2019s policies, according to a September 2024 Center survey.\n\nAmong voters who are in a union, 43% say Harris would improve things for union members, while 26% say this about Trump. By contrast, 46% of union voters say Trump\u2019s policies would make things worse for union members. Just 23% of union voters say this about Harris\u2019 policies.\n\nA majority of Americans (55%) say labor unions have a positive effect on the country, while about four-in-ten (41%) say they have a negative impact, according to the Center\u2019s January survey.\n\nThere are large partisan and ideological differences in views of how labor unions impact the country.\n\n75% of Democrats believe labor unions have a positive effect on the country, while about a quarter (23%) say they have a negative impact. More Liberal Democrats (86%) than conservative or moderate Democrats (66%) say labor unions affect the country positively.\n\nwhile about a quarter (23%) say they have a negative impact. More Liberal Democrats (86%) than conservative or moderate Democrats (66%) say labor unions affect the country positively. 35% of Republicans believe labor unions have a positive effect on American society, compared with 61% who say unions have a negative impact. Negative views are higher among conservative Republicans (69%) than moderates or liberal Republicans (47%).\n\nAbout three-quarters of union members (74%) say labor unions have a positive effect on the country. A smaller share of nonmembers (53%) say the same.",

        "text": "Economic factors and currency volatility in the 2024 US presidential election\nImageFlow // Shutterstock\n\nWritten by Moheb Hanna\n\nThe U.S. Presidential elections are approaching, and although there are many political and societal factors that may determine the outcome of an election, November 2024 may be affected by economic factors. Voters are closely monitoring the economy due to the high inflation experienced in the aftermath of COVID-19. To combat inflation, the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates 11 times since April 2022. Although inflation has declined from its 2022 peak, it remains a concern in certain sectors, explains OANDA's market analyst Moheb Hanna.\n\nIn a year where monetary policy decisions by world central banks continue to dominate headlines, the Federal Reserve has only recently made its first cut since 2020, cutting rates by a staggering 50 basis points. This more \"cautious\" approach contrasts those of the European Central Bank and the Bank of Canada, who opted to reduce interest rates much earlier in the year following a steady decline in inflation indicators.\n\nIn the post-COVID period, the U.S. has experienced strong economic growth and a robust job market, outperforming global economies. Recent data, however, indicates that Americans are spending more cautiously, seeking bargains, and reducing leisure spending.\n\nWhich Currency Pairs Are Likely to be Most Affected by the Volatility Surrounding the U.S. Presidential Election?\n\nAs the world's reserve currency, the U.S. dollar often experiences fluctuations in value due to various factors. This volatility is expected to increase around the U.S. elections as global currencies and commodities are priced against the dollar. Moreover, the Federal Reserve's November meeting, scheduled during the election week, will likely amplify market volatility due to anticipated interest rate decisions and economic announcements.\n\nThe anticipated market volatility surrounding the election may present diverse trading opportunities across various currency pairs and timeframes. Prolonged uncertainty or delayed election results could extend this period of heightened volatility, potentially offering even more trading prospects. As the November 2024 presidential election approaches, traders are likely anticipating numerous election-driven trading opportunities in the currency markets. Some traders may also position themselves ahead of the election, therefore, volatility may have already started.\n\n1. USD/MXN: Price action during 2016 and 2020 U.S. elections, Mexico's elections, USMCA agreement and COVID-19\n\nThe Mexican peso has been a strong performer over the past two years, primarily due to high interest rates, economic growth, and increased cooperation with U.S. businesses. This has presented a significant carry trade opportunity, with Mexico's interest rate at 11.25% compared to the U.S. dollar's 5.50%. Although the peso has experienced fluctuations, including a 37% rise against the USD from March 2020 to July 2023 and a subsequent rebound to 18.10 in June 2024, it remains an attractive investment for some investors. Pre-election positioning, driven by factors like interest rate differentials and differing inflation rates between the two countries, may influence the USD/MXN exchange rate. Historical trends show varying peso responses to U.S. elections, with potential implications depending on whether Harris or Trump wins. While Harris's win might maintain the status quo, Trump's win could reintroduce tariff concerns. Additionally, Mexico's strong economic ties with the U.S., particularly through the USMCA, add another layer of complexity to the USD/MXN relationship.\n\n2. USD/JPY: Price action during 2016 and 2020 US elections, FOMC Interest Rate hikes and Bank of Japan intervention\n\nIn March 2024, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) concluded its extensive monetary easing program, including its negative interest rate policies, which had been in place for over eight years. The central bank maintained its interest rate at 0.10%. Traders are now closely watching for any signals from the BOJ regarding quantitative tightening (QT), as the bank is expected to gradually reduce its bond holdings. This process, if not carefully managed, could potentially disrupt the market. To mitigate this, the BOJ might opt to reduce bond purchases at a slower rate than their holding expiration, a strategy requiring cautious execution.\n\nThe Japanese yen is currently trading near its lowest point versus the dollar in 38 years, and at a level not seen since 1986, worrying traders. Despite both the U.S. and Japan maintaining their interest rates for a prolonged period, the yen has continued to weaken against the dollar, contributing to market uncertainty. As a result, and in a measure to stop \"excessive fluctuations driven by speculation,\" the Bank of Japan is known to have intervened at least once in recent history, aiming to prop up yen prices. Owing to abnormalities in price action, some traders have speculated that market intervention has happened more than just once, but the BOJ has yet to officially confirm.\n\nAlthough the BOJ is in a rate-raising mode and the Fed is expected to cut rates, the interest rate differential between the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen remains appealing. Carry trades on USD/JPY can still offer returns for long-term investors, though these returns may be lower than other carry trade opportunities. However, they might also involve less risk compared to other available carry trade pairs.\n\n3. EUR/USD: Price action during 2016 and 2020 US elections\n\nThe EUR/USD is the most frequently traded currency pair in the foreign exchange markets. During events that impact global markets, like the U.S. elections, the euro tends to be more susceptible to market risks. This is primarily due to changes in U.S. interest rates affecting the U.S. dollar, rather than the euro itself. EU inflation has seen a recent uptick in May 2024, rising to 2.6% year-on-year, primarily driven by energy costs. This follows a period of steady decline since its peak in March/April 2022. The ECB, having already reduced interest rates by 25 basis points on June 6th, 2024, is now faced with the challenge of balancing inflation control with potential future rate cuts. The latest inflation increase, while bringing the indicator closer to pre-pandemic averages, adds complexity to the ECB's decision-making process.\n\nHistorically, the euro has reacted to shifts in US leadership. It initially declined under Trump's presidency, falling 8.5% to 1.0320. However, it later rebounded, reaching 1.2550 against the dollar. A sharp drop occurred in early 2018, finding support above 1.0600 during COVID-19, followed by another rise to 1.2200. With Biden's inauguration and the onset of the Ukraine war, coupled with FOMC interest rate hikes, the euro experienced a significant decline of 22.80%, reaching below parity at 0.9600. It has since partially recovered, trading within the 1.0550 \u2013 1.1200 range in early 2023.\n\n4. USD/CAD: Price action during 2016 and 2020 US elections, USMCA agreement and COVID-19\n\nCanada, a major economic partner of the USA, has a highly correlated economy. The USD/CAD exchange rate is influenced by interest rates in both countries and oil prices, as Canada is a significant oil producer and a member of OPEC+. As Trump took office in January 2017, and when Biden did in January 2021, the Canadian dollar rose significantly against the U.S. dollar as an initial reaction, and in both cases, the exchange price returned to its pre-election levels. Under the Trump administration, the USD/CAD rate remained relatively stable during the negotiation and implementation of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which took effect on July 1st, 2020. However, anticipatory market positioning was evident before that.\n\nCanadian inflation has followed global trends, rising post-COVID and then declining sharply after peaking around 8% in mid-2022. By early 2024, key inflation measures remained below 3%. This decline, coupled with weaker-than-expected economic growth, led to anticipation of the Bank of Canada's actions. On June 5, 2024, the Bank of Canada became the first to cut interest rates by 25 basis points. Governor Tiff Macklem emphasized data-driven decision-making for future adjustments.\n\nDespite strong retail sales over the past five years, recent months have shown a decline in specific categories, suggesting consumer caution and potential delays in interest-sensitive purchases. This trend is noteworthy as it coincides with a slowdown in Canada's GDP growth since late 2021.\n\nThis story was produced by OANDA and reviewed and distributed by Stacker Media.",

        "text": "Immigration and the Presidential Election\nOne of the top issues in this presidential election is immigration\u2014though it is much more important for Republican voters than for Democrats, according to the Pew Research Center. Immigration policy encompasses all those who have already immigrated to the U.S. from all over the world, and those who might arrive in the future, but attention is often focused on the border with Mexico.\n\nTufts Now reached out to two faculty members with expertise in the area to understand why immigration is an issue for the campaigns and voters, and what the implications might be for immigrants under a Donald Trump or Kamala Harris presidency.\n\nDeborah Schildkraut, the John Richard Skuse, Class of 1941, Professor of Political Science, is the author of, most recently, States of Belonging: Immigration Policies, Attitudes, and Inclusion; one aspect of her research examines how the changing ethnic composition of the United States affects public opinion. Helen Marrow, a professor in the Department of Sociology, is an editor of The New Americans: A Guide to Immigration Since 1965 and teaches an undergraduate seminar on the public opinion, politics, and media of immigration.\n\nWhy is immigration an important issue this election cycle?\n\nDeborah Schildkraut: People respond to the information environment that they\u2019re in. If the information environment is spending a lot of time talking about immigration, people are going to be more likely to think immigration is a problem. That\u2019s not to say that there aren\u2019t problems with immigration that should be addressed. There are, but the extent to which it\u2019s on people\u2019s radars corresponds to how much the candidates are talking about it, and how much media is talking about it.\n\nHelen Marrow: Immigration is almost never American voters\u2019 top priority in the leadup to national elections. But it is what we call a wedge issue\u2014it\u2019s very easily manipulated by political and media entrepreneurs to raise voters\u2019 racial and economic anxieties and catch their attention. Similarly, media outlets\u2014even centrist and mainstream ones\u2014know their viewership numbers and ratings will go up when they talk about it, especially if they frame it as a \u201ccrisis\u201d instead of an ordinary and continuous facet of human life.\n\nGiven that most immigration that Americans hear about is on the border with Mexico, will the focus on immigration cause a rise in Latino voters favoring Democrats?\n\nSchildkraut: I think it\u2019s important to be wary of assuming that any rhetoric from Republicans that demonizes immigrants will lead Latino voters to be more supportive of Democrats. That\u2019s not always true. It\u2019s also often not true that immigration is going to be the most important issue for Latino voters.\n\nWhy might anti-immigration rhetoric push some Latino voters to support Republicans?\n\nSchildkraut: One theory is that when people belong to a group that is being maligned, people in that group can use different identity management strategies. One way is to try to distance yourself from the group that\u2019s being maligned. A lot of Latino voters are not immigrants, so they may resent being treated as immigrants. That might make them want to create more distance psychologically between themselves and immigrants.\n\nSome Latino people prioritize seeing themselves as American or seeing themselves as white. There\u2019s some research that shows that the more that Hispanic people do that, they\u2019re also more likely to support Trump and to support restrictive immigration policies.\n\nIt shows that we need to recognize the complex heterogeneity among voters on all kinds of issues, but especially with respect to how they respond to immigration being made a central issue in the election.\n\nWho are Trump and Harris trying to appeal to when talking about immigration?\n\nSchildkraut: I think for Trump, he\u2019s appealing to his base. What\u2019s been remarkable is just how stable his level of support seems to be. It\u2019s been at a ceiling for a long time, so he needs to get his base to turn out. Making people angry about issues like immigration motivates turnout, which is really important for him.\n\nI think for Harris, it might be a little different. When she talks about immigration, it\u2019s about appealing to people who are movable in their preferences, who might otherwise stay home or be on the fence. I suspect that regardless of her own ideas about policy solutions, the campaign would prefer not to focus on immigration, because they want to appeal both to people who are interested in a law-and-order approach and to people who prefer a more welcoming approach.\n\nThe issue is very complicated and a presidential campaign doesn\u2019t lend itself well to the nuance that it demands. Many of her comments about immigration therefore focus on governing styles and her willingness to compromise across the aisle to try to pass reforms. While that may in fact be true for her, it also allows her to shift the focus a bit.\n\nWhat might be the consequences for immigrants of a Trump or Harris election in November?\n\nMarrow: The consequences of a second Trump presidency are pretty clear, since we saw what happened during his first term. Trump and his immigration advisors made total restriction a centerpiece of their agenda. They came out of the gate quickly, banning anyone from several Muslim-majority countries from entering in January 2017. They went on to target undocumented immigrants, including by widening interior enforcement priorities to include anyone who lacks official legal status, not merely people who also have criminal records for other infractions.\n\nThey also targeted other groups, including asylum-seekers, refugees, and people who have what we call \u201cdiscretionary\u201d or \u201ctemporary\u201d status to live and work in the U.S. For example, they not only dramatically reduced the numbers of refugees admitted into the country, but also reduced the amount of federal funding going toward refugee resettlement agencies and initiatives.\n\nThey actively encouraged the separation of small children from their parents during the asylum process, and later even started sending asylum-seekers back to \u201cremain in Mexico\u201d while they await the verdicts on their cases. And they cancelled the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, and suspended the designation of Temporary Protected Status for nationals from certain foreign countries.\n\nIn fact, the list of executive orders and policy initiatives is so long that these are only a few of the better-known examples. But since some of them were eventually blocked by or stalled in the courts, I suspect we would see a second Trump administration try to bring them back again.\n\nI also suspect a second Trump administration would continue its prior practice of quietly understaffing the federal immigration courts, which has lengthened backlogs there. It could even start targeting other groups of immigrants, too, including ones who arrive here legally through family reunification categories, as well as temporary \u201cnon-immigrants\u201d like students on F visas, highly-skilled workers on H-1 visas, and tourists.\n\nHow would things look different if Harris were elected president?\n\nMarrow: I have comparatively less to say about the consequences of a Harris victory. Democratic politicians have locked themselves into a cycle of \u201cenforcement-only\u201d politics over the last few decades, so I suspect we could see a few of the same things I just laid out for a Trump presidency, such as continued rhetoric about needing to \u201cget tough\u201d on undocumented immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border, and a continuation of the \u201cremain in Mexico\u201d policy, which routinely violates both U.S. and international asylum law by sending asylum-seekers abroad while they await verdicts on their cases here.\n\nBut, like the Biden administration before it, a Harris presidency would probably try to temper those kind of policies with making incremental increases to the numbers of refugee admissions, preserving policies like DACA and TPS, and narrowing enforcement priorities back mainly onto immigrants who have serious criminal records. Symbolically, a Harris presidency would likely even try to reframe immigrants and refugees in a more celebratory light, even as it tries to balance this with a \u201claw-and-order\u201d approach to the southern border. After all, Harris herself is the child of immigrants from India and Jamaica.",

        "text": "Donald Trump calls himself \u2018father of IVF\u2019 at all-women town hall\nFormer U.S. President Donald Trump called himself the \"father of IVF\" at a town hall for women voters on Wednesday (October 16, 2024), as the Republican Presidential candidate tries to convince the crucial voting bloc they can trust him on reproductive issues.\n\nMr. Trump, who is trailing Democrat Kamala Harris in popularity among women voters ahead of the November 5 U.S. election, suggested he was eager to discuss the issue at an all-women event hosted by Fox News in Georgia. The state is among a handful likely to decide the election.\n\nKamala Harris slams Donald Trump for suggesting U.S. military handle \u2019enemy from within\u2019 on election day\n\n\"I want to talk about IVF. I'm the father of IVF, so I want to hear this question,\" Mr. Trump said. Hearing that some women were concerned about possible restrictions on fertility treatments, Mr. Trump touted his party's support for the procedure, even though some conservative Republicans do not support in vitro fertilization.\n\nSenate Republicans blocked Democratic-led legislation designed to protect IVF access twice in recent months, with some Republicans arguing the legislation is unnecessary as IVF access is not in danger.\n\n\"We really are the party for IVF,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We want fertilization that is all the way, and the Democrats tried to attack us on it, and we're out there on IVF, even more than them.\" IVF emerged as a hot-button issue in the election after the conservative Alabama Supreme Court ruled in February that embryos are children. That ruling left it unclear how to legally store, transport and use embryos, prompting some IVF patients to consider moving their frozen embryos out of the state.\n\nRepublicans nationwide scrambled to contain the backlash from the decision, while Democrats warned more reproductive rights could be under threat.\n\nMr. Trump's campaign described his \"father of IVF\" comment as a joke. \"It was a joke President Trump made in jest when he was enthusiastically answering a question about IVF as he strongly supports widespread access to fertility treatments for women and families,\" spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said.\n\nMs. Harris, when asked about Mr. Trump's comments, warned against being \"distracted by his choice of words. The reality is his actions have been very harmful to women and families in America on this issue,\" Ms. Harris told reporters.\n\nAccording to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released this week, 49% of women who are registered to vote support Harris, while 40% support Mr. Trump. Polls also show Americans broadly trust Democrats more than Republicans on reproductive rights.\n\nMr. Trump, who as President appointed three of the justices who made up the majority that ended constitutional protection for abortion, has said the matter should now be decided by individual states. He also has said he would support making IVF free of charge, though he has not detailed how he would do so.\n\n'ENEMY FROM WITHIN'\n\nAt times during the town hall, Mr. Trump returned to the dark language that has been a hallmark of many of his campaign stops. Mr. Trump warned of the danger posed by an \"enemy from within\" \u2014 a phrase he has used before \u2014 and he called his opponents \"evil.\"\n\n\"They're really very different and it is the enemy from within, and they're dangerous,\" Mr. Trump said, while discussing his political foes. Mr. Trump was responding to a comment from Fox host Harris Faulkner, who noted that Ms. Harris had criticised an interview Mr. Trump gave to Fox News on Sunday (October 13, 2024), during which he had called Democrats the enemy from within.\n\nDuring that interview, Mr. Trump suggested that the National Guard or Army could be deployed to handle \"radical-left lunatics.\"\n\n\u201cAs he is out of office, Mr. Trump has no authority to order such a deployment though he repeatedly expressed interest in using the military to quell civilian protesters during his 2017-to-2021 term,\u201d according to former advisors.",

As several other states start early voting, we will be closely watching to see whether similar patterns hold elsewhere, because early voting has important implications for how election results might unfold on election night.\n\nVirginia\u2019s first two weeks of voting by mail and early in-person voting suggest that the gap between the early vote in Republican and Democratic counties might be smaller this year compared with 2020.\n\nThe table above shows how many votes and absentee ballots were cast in 2020 based on a jurisdiction\u2019s overall lean toward Democratic or Republican candidates. In 2020, about 2.8 million, or 63%, of the roughly 4.5 million total votes in Virginia were cast before Election Day. However, there were substantial differences in the number of early voters based on a city\u2019s or a county\u2019s partisan lean. In those cities and counties that strongly favor Democratic candidates, 70% of voters cast absentee ballots. In comparison, only about 50% of voters in Republican-leaning counties and cities cast absentee ballots.\n\nThe table below compares how many 2024 absentee ballots were recorded as returned by Oct. 11 in the same areas, according to TargetSmart, a voter data vendor. So far, more absentee voting has occurred in places that tend to support Republicans than places that tend to lean Democratic.\n\nOne way to capture the trend is by calculating the percentage of 2020 votes in an area that have already been cast in 2024 via absentee ballots. That ranges from about 12% in the areas that are most supportive of Democrats to almost 22% in those areas that lean toward Republicans.\n\nTargetSmart also provides information about how frequently such voters participated in the past three statewide general elections (the 2020 presidential election, the 2021 election for governor and the 2022 midterm election).\n\nVoters who have participated in most or all of those elections are almost certain to vote in the coming presidential election \u2014 which means observing that these voters are casting their ballots well before Election Day instead of later does not tell us much about what the turnout will look like. However, if early voters are less consistent or new voters, it could signal a shift in electoral trends ahead of November.\n\nSo far, it appears that about 90% of the people who have voted in Virginia are consistent voters who participated in at least two or three of those elections. And there are no meaningful differences in the shares of consistent voters based on the partisan lean of the area.\n\nWhile it might be tempting to interpret the patterns as evidence that consistent Democratic voters are going to cast ballots at lower rates than Republicans in Virginia, we assess that such a conclusion is premature. To see why, the table below uses data from the Virginia Public Access Project to show when voters cast absentee ballots in the state\u2019s 2022 election.\n\nSpecifically, the table shows what share of the total absentee ballots cast were recorded 25 days before the election. The data shows that only about 21% of the early in-person ballots and 39% of the mail ballots had been cast at this point in 2022. Notably, a higher percentage of the absentee ballots had been cast in areas more supportive of Republicans than in areas more supportive of Democrats.\n\nWhy might voters in more Democratic-leaning areas cast their votes later than in areas more supportive of Republicans? One possible explanation is the availability of \u201csatellite voting locations\u201d in some Virginia jurisdictions. These are additional locations, beyond the general registrar\u2019s office of a county or a city, where voters can cast early in-person ballots starting later in October. Such satellite voting locations may make early in-person voting accessible in more populous areas, which tend to be more Democratic-leaning. We will be watching closely to see whether those differences by area even out, or possibly reverse, over the next couple of weeks as satellite voting begins.\n\nIf we continue to observe turnout lagging in Democratic areas compared with Republican areas after satellite voting begins, it would lead us to do more investigation about whether consistent Democratic voters appear to be less mobilized than normal this election cycle.\n\nWhy these patterns matter for the NBC News Decision Desk\n\nPart of why the NBC News Decision Desk watches absentee voting so closely is its implications for the sequencing of how votes get reported on election night. The fact that Democrats were more likely to cast mail and early in-person ballots than Republicans made our work on the Decision Desk more challenging than normal in 2020.\n\nWe are accustomed to the fact that counties report election results at different speeds on election night. In some states, smaller, largely rural counties tend to report their votes first, while in others, larger, mostly urban counties are the first to report. We have long used models that try to account for such unevenness by analyzing whether the counties that have reported more votes tended to lean more Democratic or Republican in past elections compared with counties that have reported fewer votes. The models help us assess what the current reported results suggest about the likely final outcomes.\n\nBefore 2020, such models did not adequately account for the fact that counties also do not report different results by vote mode at the same speed. In some states, counties initially report the mail and early in-person votes and then the Election Day votes. In others, the order is flipped.\n\nAs it became clear in 2020 that Democrats were going to disproportionately vote by mail or vote early in person and Republicans were going to disproportionately vote on Election Day, we had to quickly improve our models to account not only for differences in the rates of reporting over counties, but also for differences in which vote modes had been counted. And while we are now in a better place to deal with that issue, it will still generally take us longer to project races in states where there are substantial partisan differences in voters\u2019 use of mail and early in-person voting and differences in the speed of reporting by vote mode.\n\nHowever, seeing the data out of Virginia makes us cautiously optimistic that we may observe less partisan differences by vote mode in 2024 than in 2020, at least in states like Virginia that have extensive early in-person voting.",

For the latest news on the presidential election, read USA TODAY's live election updates for Friday, Oct. 18.\n\nWASHINGTON - Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are closing in on the final weeks of the 2024 presidential election.\n\nOn Thursday, Harris focused her campaign on a pivotal state: Wisconsin. Meanwhile, Trump attended a longtime political tradition in New York City, known as the Al Smith dinner.\n\nRegardless of where they're hitting the campaign trail, Harris and Trump will spend the weeks leading up to Election Day making their final pitches to voters across the country, outlining how they'd approach issues ranging from inflation to the southern border and abortion rights.\n\nCheck back here for live coverage from across the USA TODAY network.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nTrump fires insults at Harris, others at charity dinner\n\nTrump hurled insults and attacks on targets ranging from Harris to former New York Mayor Bill DeBlasio during a Thursday monologue at a Catholic charity dinner Thursday.\n\nTrump drew some groans and boos from the white-tied audience at the annual Al Smith dinner, including what even he called a \"nasty\" joke about the first marriage of Harris spouse Douglas Emhoff. Trump attacked Harris - who did not attend the dinner - on items ranging from her late entry into the race to her laugh.\n\nThe former president also described one of the other guests, DeBlasio, as the \"worst mayor\" New York has ever had, and responded to the audience reaction by saying \"I don't give a s---.\" He added, \"that's not comedy by the way - that's fact.\"\n\nIt was a reminiscent of candidate Trump's speech at the 2016 Al Smith dinner, when he constantly insulted Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton.\n\nAt one point, Trump announced he would tell a few \"self-deprecating\" jokes, then quickly added: \"Nope - I've got nothing; there's nothing to say.\"\n\nHarris, having declined an invitation to speak in person in order to spend the day campaigning in the battleground state of Wisconsin, spoke via a short video, part serious and part joking. The video featured comedian Molly Shannon, who portrayed a young Catholic girl giving advice to Harris about her speech to a largely Catholic audience.\n\nTold not to say anything negative about Catholics, Harris made a reference to a recent Trump event in Michigan by saying \"that would be like criticizing Detroit in Detroit.\"\n\nShannon's character also told Harris: \"Don't worry if you make a mistake - Catholic people are very forgiving.\"\n\n\u2013 David Jackson\n\nHarris says Americans are 'exhausted' with Trump\n\nKamala Harris took a swipe at Donald Trump over his claim at a Univision town hall that the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol was \"a day of love.\"\n\n\"It points out something that everyone here knows: the American people are exhausted with his gaslighting,\" she said. \"Enough.\"\n\nHarris also made light of her combative interview on Fox News at the campaign stop in La Crosse, saying that she is campaigning for the vote of every American, \"no matter their political party, where they live or where they get their news.\"\n\n\"And on that point, last night, you may have seen I went on Fox News,\" she said, laughing.\n\nShe used the aside as a set up for her comments about Trump.\n\n\u2013 Francesca Chambers\n\nDonald Trump to 'work the fryers' at a Pennsylvania McDonald's on Sunday\n\nDonald Trump is planning another campaign stop in the Philadelphia suburbs, this time at a McDonald\u2019s in Lower Southampton, Pennsylvania, on Sunday, according to sources familiar with the visit.\n\nThe 2024 presidential candidate plans to stop at the fast food chain in the early afternoon, according to a source who did not have permission to publicly comment.\n\nTrump reportedly plans to \u201cwork the fryer\u201d behind the counter, a stop he referenced at a rally in Indiana, Pennsylvania, late last month \u2013 a job Harris said she had when she was growing up.\n\n\u2013 Chris Ullery and Jo Ciavaglia\n\nHarris addresses hecklers in crowd\n\nAbout 20 minutes into Harris' remarks at a Thursday campaign rally in La Crosse, Wisconsin, some members of the crowd shouted as the vice president talked about the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade in 2022.\n\n\u201cOh, you guys are at the wrong rally,\u201d Harris joked before taking a jab at Donald Trump. \u201cNo, I think you meant to go to the smaller one down the street.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Marina Pitofsky, Francesca Chambers\n\nMark Cuban calls Trump \u2018The Grinch\u2019 in attack on tariff plan\n\nHarris got an assist Thursday from billionaire businessman Mark Cuban, who excoriated Trump\u2019s plan for across-the-board tariffs on China as he sought to bolster the Democratic nominee\u2019s economic pitch to voters.\n\nCuban, a host of ABC\u2019s \u201cShark Tank\u201d and minority owner of the NBA\u2019s Dallas Mavericks, coined Trump \u201cThe Grinch\u201d at a campaign rally in La Crosse, Wisconsin. The campaign surrogate argued Trump\u2019s plan for 60% tariffs on all imports from China will result in higher costs for consumers come holiday season.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump wants you to have a lousy Christmas,\u201d Cuban said. \u201cDonald Trump is \u2018The Grinch\u2019 that wants to steal your Christmas.\u201d Cuban said Trump has \u201cso little understanding of tariffs, he thinks that China pays for them. This is the same guy who also thought that Mexico would pay for the wall.\"\n\nThe Harris campaign is using a swing Thursday and Friday through the Midwest battleground states of Wisconsin and Michigan to drive home an economic message. That includes emphasizing Harris\u2019 proposal for tax deductions for new small businesses. While most polls suggest Trump has an advantage on who voters perceive is better equipped the economy, Harris has made up ground.\n\n\u201cThis election is a battle for entrepreneurs. This election is a battle for small businesses,\u201d Cuban said, highlighting Harris\u2019 goal to grow the number of small businesses in the U.S. from 33 million to more than 50 million.\n\n\u2013 Joey Garrison\n\nWhen will we know the results of the 2024 election?\n\nIt's not clear. Voters from coast to coast will want to know whether Donald Trump or Kamala Harris won the 2024 race for the White House on Election Day, but it's not likely.\n\nElection officials will have millions of votes to tabulate, following specific procedures, and the candidates could launch legal challenges in some states.\n\n\u2013 Marina Pitofsky\n\nWant daily politics news in your inbox? Subscribe to On Politics for the news as we lead up to the presidential election.\n\nVance on whether Trump lost in 2020: 'No'\n\nJoe Biden may be in the White House, but Republican vice-presidential candidate JD Vance stated unequivocally Wednesday that he believes Donald Trump did not lose the 2020 election.\n\nVance was asked by a reporter during an event in Pennsylvania what message it sends \u201cto independent voters when you do not answer the question, did Donald Trump lose in 2020?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve answered this question directly a million times,\u201d Vance said. \u201cNo. I think there are serious problems in 2020. So did Donald Trump lose the election? Not by the words that I would use.\u201d\n\nTrump has insisted without evidence that the 2020 election was rigged. Vance often has parried questions about Trump\u2019s unfounded election fraud claims, such as during his debate with Democratic vice-presidential candidate Tim Walz.\n\nWalz asked Vance \u201cDid Trump lose the 2020 election?\u201d Vance responded that he is \u201cfocused on the future,\u201d leading Walz to call it a \u201cdamning non answer.\u201d\n\nVance\u2019s comments at the event in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, were an unambiguous embrace of Trump\u2019s claim that he didn\u2019t lose, despite all the evidence to the contrary.\n\n-Zac Anderson\n\nMcConnell called Trump 'despicable' and a 'narcissist,' cried after Capitol riot, new book says\n\nSenate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell privately described then-President Donald Trump as \"stupid as well as being ill-tempered,\" \"despicable\" and a \"narcissist,\" after the 2020 election, according to excerpts from a forthcoming biography of the longtime Senate power broker.\n\nThe remarks, recorded by McConnell and shared with Associated Press Deputy Washington Bureau Chief Michael Tackett, are McConnell's strongest condemnation yet of the former president, despite years of a famously frosty relationship between the two men.\n\nIn the weeks following Election Day in 2020, when Trump and his campaign were working to overturn the election results, McConnell said in his recordings that \u201cit\u2019s not just the Democrats who are counting the days\u201d until Trump left office, according to the AP.\n\n\u2013 Riley Beggin\n\nKamala Harris to address Al Smith dinner via video\n\nKamala Harris won't be at the Al Smith charity dinner, a white tie event that raises money for Catholic charities and typically features candidates trading jabs. But she is going to address the dinner by video on Thursday, according to multiple reports.\n\nHarris' campaign had previously said she was focusing on campaigning in battleground states and wouldn't travel to the event. The vice president is in Wisconsin today, one of the states that could ultimately decide the 2024 election.\n\nTrump is set to attend the dinner in person in New York City.\n\n\u2212 Marina Pitofsky\n\nHarris says Sinwar\u2019s death presents moment for \u2018day after\u2019 in Middle East\n\nKamala Harris said \u201cjustice has been served\u201d following the death of Hamas Yahya Sinwar in a brief statement to reporters on the campaign trail in La Crosse, Wisconsin.\n\n\u201cSinwar was responsible for the killing of thousands of innocent including the victims of October 7 and hostages killed in Gaza. He had American blood on his hands,\u201d Harris said. \u201cToday, I can only hope that the families of the victims of Hamas feel a sense and measure of relief.\u201d\n\nHarris, the Democratic nominee for president, commended the work of U.S. intelligence officials who worked in tandem with Israeli to locate Sinwar.\n\n\u201cAnd I will say, to any terrorist who kills Americans, threatens the American people, or threatens our troops or our interests, know this: We will always bring you to justice,\u201d Harris said. \u201cIsrael has a right to defend itself, and the threat Hamas poses to Israel must be eliminated today. There is clear progress toward that goal.\u201d\n\nShe said Sinwar\u2019s death \u201cgives us an opportunity\" to end the conflict in Gaza. \u201cAnd it must end such that Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom and self-determination,\u201d Harris said.\n\n\u2212Joey Garrison\n\n3 controversial swing-state counties to watch in 2024 election\n\nIn county governments across the country, officials who fear elections are vulnerable to fraud have been taking matters into their own hands, lodging protests and investigations.\n\nMany have delayed and voted against certifying elections since former President Donald Trump falsely claimed his 2020 loss was due to voter fraud. In Nevada, a commissioner of a key swing county said she learned information that warranted \"further investigation.\"\n\nIn Mohave County, Arizona, a commissioner who voted to delay a certification vote said it was a statement of solidarity with other counties that were delaying certification. In Michigan, two members of a county board of canvassers in the Upper Peninsula didn't believe three recall elections all could have had a similar margin.\n\nAn official in Colorado breached her own county\u2019s voting machines, and another in Ohio was investigated for a potential attempted breach.\n\nThen there are counties that attempt to replace machine-counting ballots with having humans hand-count their ballots, a practice that studies show is less accurate and timely than using machines.\n\nSome of these counties are in key swing states, or blue states where Vice President Kamala Harris is dependent on electoral votes to win.\n\nCheck out the full report here on the three swing-state counties where officials have created controversy over elections, and how they could affect the presidential election.\n\n- Erin Mansfeld\n\n3 ways the election loser could try to reverse the outcome\n\nWhen Congress passed the Electoral Count Reform Act in the wake of former President Donald Trump's post-2020 election effort to reverse his loss, leaders in both parties said it would help safeguard future elections.\n\nThere are still holes that could be exploited, however, especially at the local level. Some of those holes are already being tested by local officials, such as refusing to certify elections at the county level, according to Matthew Seligman, a fellow at Stanford's Constitutional Law Center and co-author of the 2024 book \"How to Steal a Presidential Election.\"\n\n\"Due to the changes in the Electoral Count Reform Act, the effort has shifted to try to get county boards of elections, and then potentially state-level boards of election, to have some kind of authority to refuse to certify the election results,\" Seligman told USA TODAY.\n\nCheck out the full report here on what the Electoral Count Reform Act did and three possible strategies for overturning the election in spite of it.\n\n- Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump visits a Bronx barbershop\n\nWhile preparing for Thursday night's appearance at the Al Smith dinner in New York City, Trump made an unscheduled visit to a Bronx barbershop.\n\nThe former president arrived to the Knockout Barbershop at around 1:45 p.m., according to video posted on social media.\n\nNo word yet on whether the famously coiffed Trump is actually getting a hair cut.\n\n\u2212 David Jackson\n\nFlorida's Senate race not slowed by Helene, Milton storms\n\nThe heated campaign barbs between Republican U.S. Sen. Rick Scott and his Democratic challenger, former U.S. Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, weren\u2019t cooled by the double blow of hurricanes Helene and Milton.\n\nIn fact, the storms provided more campaign fodder as the sides clashed over disaster response efforts of the federal government, as well as climate change and property insurance.\n\n\u201cAnother hurricane. More devastation. And Rick Scott is making it worse,\u201d Mucarsel-Powell stated in an ad released Oct. 2, six days after Helene made landfall at Dekle Beach in Taylor County. She went on to criticize Scott for receiving $3 million in campaign donations from property insurance companies as premiums skyrocketed in recent years.\n\nScott responded two days later \u2013 six days before Milton barreled into Sarasota County \u2013 with his own ad blasting Mucarsel-Powell for claiming he \u201cdoesn\u2019t care about hurricane victims.\u201d\n\nEach candidate has sought to help victims of the disasters.\n\nScott, in his trademark U.S. Navy hat familiar from his days overseeing recovery efforts as Governor, viewed the devastation, met with local officials and pressed President Joe Biden to issue a disaster declaration to release FEMA money.\n\nHe later met with Biden when the president toured damage in Taylor County following Helene, and also in St. Pete Beach to view Milton\u2019s destruction.\n\nMucarsel-Powell helped clear beaches in Pinellas after Helene and helped fill sandbags for residents ahead of Milton.

Cox Jr. struck down seven new rules from the board in a late-Wednesday ruling, including a controversial ballot hand-count rule that another judge had already temporarily blocked on Tuesday. Cox said the rules exceeded the state board's authority.\n\n\"An administrative agency can only act to implement existing statutory schemes; they hold no authority to create new requirements or otherwise expand their own authority,\" Cox wrote.\n\nThe board has come under increasing scrutiny after its Republican majority passed a flurry of new requirements within weeks of the election, despite being cautioned by the state's Republican attorney general that some rules were likely unlawful.\n\n- Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump cancels NRA appearance\n\nThe Republican nominee has canceled an Oct. 22 appearance before the National Rifle Association because of scheduling conflicts, the campaign and the NRA said Wednesday.\n\nTrump had been scheduled to attend a \"Defend the 2nd\" (amendment) gun rights event Tuesday in Savannah, Ga.\n\nWhile the Harris campaign tries to use gun violence as an issue against Trump, the NRA said in its cancellation notice that it still backs Trump.\n\n\"The NRA is committed to ensuring Donald Trump wins in November and returns to the White House,\" the organization said.\n\nTrump has also canceled media interviews with CNBC and CBS' '60 Minutes' in recent days.\n\n-David Jackson\n\nWhat is the Al Smith Dinner?\n\nThe annual Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner, a white-tie charity event in New York City, is known for prominent political figures poking fun at one another and the issues of the moment.\n\nThe Al Smith dinner benefits Catholic charities. Smith was known for his sense of humor, and speakers at the event often take jabs at themselves or others.\n\nIn 2016, Trump and his opponent Hillary Clinton took swipes at one another, but some of the audience booed at Trump, feeling he went too far. Trump is scheduled to speak but Harris declined the invitation for the annual event.\n\n- Kinsey Crowley\n\nHarris thanks Carter\n\nKamala Harris seized the opportunity to thank a special supporter: Former President Jimmy Carter.\n\n\u201cPresident Carter, thank you for your support,\u201d Harris said on the X social media platform.Carter, who turned 100 years old earlier this month, used Georgia\u2019s early voting period to cast his ballot for the Democratic vice president.\n\n- David Jackson\n\nWho will control the U.S. Senate next year?\n\nWhile a large chunk of the national attention in the 2024 battle for control of the U.S. Senate rests in the same presidential battlegrounds - think Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona and Nevada - several other states that are likely slam dunks for Kamala Harris or Trump also have potentially competitive contests too.\n\nWithout a Senate controlled by their own party, the next president will likely struggle to pass the most ambitious parts of their campaign platform. The Senate is also solely responsible for confirming a president's Cabinet officials and judges, from federal district courts up to the U.S. Supreme Court, where four of the nine justices will soon be in their 70s.\n\n- Riley Beggin\n\nTrump gives thumbs down to Harris\u2019 performance on Fox News\n\nNot surprisingly, Trump gave a negative review to Harris\u2019 interview on Fox News, saying all she did was criticize him.\n\n\u201cShe has a massive and irredeemable case of TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME,\u201dTrump said on Truth Social.\n\nTrump, who has been critical of Fox\u2019s coverage of the Harris campaign, gave a thumbs-up to interviewer Bret Baier, who frequently interrupted and clashed with the vice president. \u201cGreat job by Bret Baier,\u201d Trump said.\n\n- David Jackson\n\nWhere do Kamala Harris, Donald Trump stand in the polls?\n\nKamala Harris and Donald Trump are neck-and-neck in the 2024 race for the White House. In a Real Clear Politics average of national polls, Harris leads Trump by 1.7 percentage points.\n\nIt's even closer when it comes to polling averages from the battleground states. Trump leads Harris by 1.1 percentage points in Arizona, for example, and Harris leads Trump by 0.3 percentage points in Wisconsin.\n\n\u2013 Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhere is Donald Trump campaigning on Thursday?\n\nDonald Trump on Thursday is attending the annual Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner, a white-tie charity event in New York City. It's known for prominent political figures poking fun at one another and the issues of the moment.\n\nThe Al Smith dinner benefits Catholic charities. Smith was known for his sense of humor, and speakers at the event often take jabs at themselves or others.\n\nThe Harris campaign confirmed with USA TODAY that the Democratic presidential nominee will not attend the dinner scheduled for Oct. 17, as they want to focus on the battleground states so close to the election.\n\n\u2013 Kinsey Crowley\n\nWhere is Kamala Harris campaigning on Thursday?\n\nKamala Harris is bringing her presidential campaign back to Wisconsin Thursday with stops in Milwaukee, La Crosse and Green Bay.\n\nHarris' upcoming travel to the battleground states of Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan comes as the race with Donald Trump reaches its final weeks. Thursday will mark her sixth visit to Wisconsin, and her third stop in Milwaukee County. She launched her presidential campaign in Wisconsin in late July with a rally in West Allis.\n\n\u2013 Mary Spicuzza and Hope Karnopp",

        "text": "How Accurate, or Off-Target, Could the Polls Be This Year?\nHow Accurate, or Off-Target, Could the Polls Be This Year?\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing you remember about the 2016 election polls, it\u2019s probably that they were wrong \u2014 very wrong. Right?\n\nIt\u2019s true that pollsters that year underestimated Donald J. Trump\u2019s support in key swing states. But the national polls, on average, aligned pretty closely with the popular vote, which Hillary Clinton won. In fact, the national polls in 2020 were worse, but since they correctly showed Joseph R. Biden Jr. in the lead, and he won the election, the gap was not as memorable.\n\nA look at polling averages over time shows that the last two cycles were not outside the scope of previous elections. But this year, amid another tight presidential race, even a small polling miss could vastly misjudge the outcome.\n\nNational polling misses in presidential elections Polls underestimated Democrat Republican Polling\n\nmiss 2020 4 pts. 2016 1 pt. 2012 3 pts. 2008 <1 pt. 2004 1 pt. 2000 5 pts. 1996 4 pts. 1992 <1 pt. 1988 1 pt. D+10 D+5 Even R+5 R+10 Result Poll avg. Note: Arrows show the weighted national polling average margin compared with the final national popular vote margin.\n\nEvery cycle, the polls diverge from the election results to some extent. It\u2019s inevitable when pollsters can make estimates only about who will show up to vote, some people make up their minds only in the voting booth, and bombshells may drop late in the race.\n\nData from the past four decades shows that the polls do not always bias one party over the other, and that past performance can\u2019t predict how the polls will do the next time around. The polls in the 2022 midterms, for example, were some of the most accurate in years.\n\nTo judge the accuracy of presidential polls, the charts in this article show averages that combine many polls into one estimate for each election. Between 1988 and 2020, the final national polling average was off by an average of 2.3 percentage points.\n\nSome years were better than others: In 2008, the national polling average missed the final result for Barack Obama by less than one percentage point on average; in 1996, it overestimated the support for Bill Clinton by almost four points.\n\nState-level polls haven\u2019t performed quite as well. Since 2000, polls in close states have been off by an average of 3.1 points. In 2016 and 2020, nearly all of the state-level polling averages underestimated support for Mr. Trump, sometimes by a wide margin.\n\nState polling misses in presidential elections with Trump Polls underestimated Democrat Republican 2020 D+10 D+5 Even R+5 R+10 Iowa Result Poll avg. Ohio Texas Fla. N.C. Ga. Ariz. Wis. Pa. Nev. Mich. Wisconsin had one of the biggest polling misses in recent cycles, overstating Mr. Biden\u2019s support by 9 points. 2016 D+10 D+5 Even R+5 R+10 Iowa Ohio Ga. N.C. Ariz. Fla. Wis. Pa. Mich. N.H. Minn. Nev. Colo. Several states that Mr. Trump ultimately won had polling averages showing Mrs. Clinton in the lead.\n\nThe state polling misses have been magnified in the last two presidential elections \u2014 two very close races that heightened the importance of the Electoral College. But the polls\u2019 performance in those two years was not entirely unusual. A look at state polling misses since 2000 shows that polls of older elections did about as well as today\u2019s polls.\n\nState polling misses in presidential elections Polls underestimated Democrat Republican 2012 D+10 D+5 Even R+5 R+10 S.C. Result Poll avg. N.C. Fla. Ohio Va. Colo. Pa. N.H. Iowa Nev. Wis. Mich. State polls underestimated Mr. Obama, with the exception of South Carolina, which Mitt Romney won. 2008 D+10 D+5 Even R+5 R+10 Ga. Mont. Mo. N.C. Ind. Fla. Ohio Va. Polls showed John McCain leading in Indiana, but Mr. Obama won the state. 2004 D+10 D+5 Even R+5 R+10 Mo. Fla. Colo. Nev. Ohio N.M. Iowa Wis. N.H. Pa. Mich. Minn. Ore. Hawaii Polls were more of a mixed bag, with some underestimating George W. Bush, and others John Kerry. 2000 D+10 D+5 Even R+5 R+10 Tenn. Ohio Mo. N.H. Fla. Wis. Iowa Minn. Pa. Mich. Wash. Ill. Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the election. Polls showed Mr. Bush leading in Florida, but the results were razor thin.\n\nState polls have missed in both directions over the years. But if pollsters underestimated Mr. Trump in the last two elections, are they doomed to do so again this year? Should you, as some poll watchers claim to do, mentally add a boost for Mr. Trump to any poll numbers you see?\n\nPollsters believe they have largely identified what caused the polling misses in 2016. A major culprit was the failure to account for voters\u2019 education levels, according to a report from a professional organization of public pollsters. State level polls in particular that year overrepresented college-educated respondents and undercounted respondents without a college degree.\n\nThis was less of a problem in past elections, when vote choice did not cleave so sharply along educational lines. But in 2016 and thereafter, non-college-educated voters have largely supported Republicans, especially Mr. Trump.\n\nBy 2020, nearly all pollsters had begun accounting for education. But polls still underestimated Mr. Trump. This time, the cause of the error was less clear-cut. One theory, presented by a report evaluating 2020 polls, is that Trump supporters were less likely to respond to surveys. As a result, \u201ceven if you control for white non-college male, the ones that answer the survey are more Democratic than the ones who don\u2019t,\u201d said Chris Jackson, who heads U.S. public opinion research for Ipsos. Others have posited that Biden voters were more likely to stay at home during the pandemic, giving them more time and opportunity to respond to polls.\n\nYet another challenge that year: the record turnout. About a quarter of voters in 2020 had not voted in 2016, according to estimates by the Pew Research Center. And polling had indicated that any new 2020 voters would mostly be Biden supporters. In fact, they were divided between Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump, according to the Pew study.\n\nSo, what about this year? Polling in seven swing states is extremely close \u2014 in most of these states, Mr. Trump and Kamala Harris are essentially tied. While the polls in these states underestimated Mr. Trump\u2019s support in the last two cycles, historically, they have a mixed track record, with misses on both the left and right, and some years better than others.\n\nPast polling misses in presidential elections for battleground states Years in bold indicate those in which the polling leader lost in that state.

D+15 D+10 D+5 Even R+5 R+10 R+15 Note: Averages not available for some states in some years.\n\nMost pollsters have made some changes to their methodology, partly in response to the 2020 misses, and the accurate 2022 midterm polls gave pollsters some optimism.\n\nBut one key difference between the midterms and the last two presidential elections is that Mr. Trump was not on the ballot. Ultimately, there may be something about Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters that makes them especially difficult to measure in polls.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a real possibility that having Trump on the ballot makes it hard to poll for whatever reason,\u201d said Berwood Yost, the director of the Franklin & Marshall College Poll of Pennsylvania.\n\n\u201cBut the other possibility is that we\u2019ve made all these adjustments to correct the error. And perhaps we\u2019ve overcorrected,\u201d he added. \u201cI don\u2019t know which it is.\u201d",

Conducted in October 2024, EY\u2019s latest pulse poll asked 500 business leaders how they think the upcoming U.S. election will impact the technology industry.\n\nIn their responses, tech industry leaders said they plan to significantly increase AI investments in the next 12 months, However, they indicated that future progress toward AI growth may be contingent on the outcome of the elections. Specific focus areas of AI investment include hiring AI-specific talent, back-office functions, and cybersecurity.\n\nImage: Adobe Stock / Generated with AI by Marta P. (Milacroft)\n\nNearly three-fourths (74%) of technology industry leaders surveyed think the results of the upcoming U.S. election will have a major impact on the U.S. tech sector\u2019s ability to stay ahead of global competition in the next two to four years. Notably, they think that the outcome of the U.S. election would most impact the following areas of regulation: cybersecurity/data protections, AI and machine learning, and user data and content oversight.\n\n\u201cRegardless of the presidential outcome, technology companies will continue significant investment in AI,\u201d commented James Brundage, EY Global and Americas Technology Sector Leader. \u201cHowever, all eyes will be on how election results impact the direction of fiscal, tax, tariff, anti-trust and regulatory policies and the resulting impact on interest rates, mergers and acquisitions, IPOs, and AI regulations. Coming off of a sluggish tech market in 2024, the 2025 trajectory is bullish, as companies focus on raising capital to invest in growth and emerging technologies like AI.\u201d\n\nOther key findings from the EY survey include:\n\nTech leaders double down on AI: The majority of technology leaders (87%) said their company plans to increase AI investments by 50% or more in the next year. The key areas where they plan to focus AI investment over the next year include AI-specific talent (60%), cybersecurity (49%), and back-office functions (45%). Most tech industry leaders surveyed also plan to allocate/reallocate resources toward AI investments in the next 6\u201312 months, with 78% of tech leaders reporting their company is thinking about divesting noncore assets or businesses as part of their growth strategy during that time.\n\nThe majority of technology leaders (87%) said their company plans to increase AI investments by 50% or more in the next year.

Size hinders AI speed: Tech leaders said around 63% of their organization\u2019s AI initiatives have successfully moved to the implementation phase. However, organizations that employ more employees report less success moving AI initiatives to the implementation phase. Among those who indicate that fewer than half of their AI initiatives have been implemented successfully, data quality issues (40%) and talent/skills shortages (34%) are the most common reasons for AI initiatives failing to progress to the next stage.\n\nTech leaders said around 63% of their organization\u2019s AI initiatives have successfully moved to the implementation phase.

The search for AI talent accelerates: As companies continue to integrate more AI into their businesses, the need to hire AI-specific talent will increase, as well as the need to restructure or reduce headcount from legacy job functions. In fact, 80% of tech leaders surveyed said they foresee reducing or restructuring headcount from legacy functions to other in-demand functions, and 77% anticipate an increase in hiring for AI-specific talent. Additionally, 40% of technology leaders said their company plans to focus next year\u2019s AI investments on human capital efforts such as training.\n\n\u201cAs companies pivot to more investments in AI talent, there are key considerations for tech leaders as they strive to bridge the gap between AI investment and implementation,\u201d remarked Ken Englund, EY Americas Technology Sector Growth Leader. \u201cThese include hiring talent with both hard and soft skills, offering AI training programs, and upskilling their workforce.\u201d",

        "text": "US presidential election looms over IMF and World Bank annual meetings\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Global finance leaders face a major uncertainty as they meet in Washington next week: Who will win the U.S. presidential election and shape the policies of the world\u2019s biggest economy?\n\nRepublican nominee former President Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris have spoken little about their plans for the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. But their differing views on trade, tariffs and other economic issues will be on the minds of the finance leaders as they attend the financial institutions\u2019 annual meetings.\n\nIMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva alluded to what\u2019s at stake in a curtain-raiser speech Thursday ahead of the meetings.\n\nWithout naming Trump, she warned that \u201cmajor players, driven by national security concerns, are increasingly resorting to industrial policy and protectionism, creating one trade restriction after another.\u201d\n\nShe said trade \u201cwill not be the same engine of growth as before,\u201d warning that trade restrictions are \u201clike pouring cold water on an already-lukewarm world economy.\u201d\n\nTrump promises as president to impose a 60% tariff on all Chinese goods and a \u201cuniversal\u2019\u2019 tariff of 10% or 20% on everything else that enters the United States, insisting that the cost of taxing imported goods is absorbed by the foreign countries that produce those goods.\n\nHowever, mainstream economists say they actually amount to a tax on American consumers that would make the economy less efficient and send inflation surging in the United States.\n\nWhat to know about Trump\u2019s second term:\n\nStaffing the administration: Here are the people Trump has picked recess appointments Follow all of our coverage as Donald Trump assembles his second administration.\n\nTrump has also embraced isolationism and heavily criticized multilateral institutions. During his first term, he signed an executive order to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, and replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. His administration blocked new appointments to the World Trade Organization appellate body as the terms of its judges expired, leaving the organization without a functional appellate body.\n\nWorld Bank President Ajay Banga, who also made a speech Thursday previewing the meetings, spoke directly about the election in a question-and-answer session with reporters. He credited Trump for increasing investment in the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development during his presidency, which offers loans to middle-income developing countries.\n\n\u201cThen the question will be, how will the nuances of each administration be different,\u201d Banga said. \u201cI don\u2019t know yet so I\u2019m not going to speculate on how to deal with them.\u201d\n\nHarris has not specified her views on the World Bank or IMF, though even as she has embraced some tariffs, is more likely to continue the Biden administration approach favoring international cooperation over threats, The Biden-Harris administration has not eliminated tariffs imposed on China during the Trump administration and in May also slapped major tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, advanced batteries, solar cells, steel, aluminum and medical equipment.\n\nHarris met Banga in June 2023 when he began his five-year term as World Bank president and released a statement then that \u201cpraised the steps taken to evolve the World Bank\u2014including expanding its mission to include building resilience to global challenges like climate change, pandemics, fragility and conflict.\u201d\n\nGeorgieva who did not speak about the election directly in her speech, said: \u201cWe live in a mistrustful, fragmented world where national security has risen to the top of the list of concerns for many countries. This has happened before \u2014 but never in a time of such high economic co-dependence. My argument is that we must not allow this reality to become an excuse to do nothing to prevent a further fracturing of the global economy.\u201d\n\n___",

        "text": "US presidential election updates: Trump\u2019s insults draw laughs at Catholic charity dinner as Harris appears remotely\nDonald Trump laid into Kamala Harris and other Democrats on Thursday in a pointed and at times bitter speech as he headlined the annual Al Smith charity dinner in New York. The Republican nominee repeatedly criticised his Democratic campaign rival over her decision to skip the event \u2013 a break with presidential electoral tradition, as she prioritised campaigning in the swing state of Wisconsin, rather than New York, a safe Democratic state. Harris recorded a video that was played instead.\n\nTrump questioned the mental fitness of Harris and the president, Joe Biden, commented on second gentleman Doug Emhoff\u2019s extramarital affair during his previous marriage, and made jokes about transgender people. The dinner was emceed by the comedian Jim Gaffigan, who portrays the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, Tim Walz, on Saturday Night Live.\n\nHarris, in her pre-recorded remarks \u2013 which featured the comedian and actor Molly Shannon, who reprised her long-running Saturday Night Live character Mary Katherine Gallagher, an awkward Catholic school pupil \u2013 mocked Trump for lying, a sin, about the results of the 2020 election, and comments he made in Michigan, saying that mocking Catholics in the video would be \u201clike criticising Detroit in Detroit\u201d.\n\nHere\u2019s what else happened on Thursday:\n\nKamala Harris election news\n\nA poll has revealed that Harris continues to lead Trump among Black likely voters in battleground states. The poll, conducted by Howard University\u2019s Initiative on Public Opinion from 2 October to 8 October, surveyed 981 Black likely voters in the states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The results show that 84% of respondents said they planned to vote for the vice-president, while only 8% said they would support Trump for president in November, and another 8% remained undecided.\n\nWith three weeks left, Harris is spending most of her days trying to shore up support in the \u201cblue wall\u201d states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin as she tries to avoid a repeat of Hillary Clinton\u2019s collapse there eight years ago. Her schedule reflects the Democratic nominee\u2019s focus on her most likely path to victory over Trump. Harris visited Milwaukee on Thursday seeking support from college-age voters. She dropped by a business class at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and held a student rally at the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse, closing out the day with a rally in Green Bay.\n\nThe Democratic governors of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin this week embarked on a swiftly organised bus tour, rolling through the autumn landscape to press the urgency of the case for Harris in must-win states where some Democrats worry she is struggling. Gretchen Whitmer, Josh Shapiro and Tony Evers descended on Flint on Thursday afternoon, joined by the chairman of the national Democratic party, Jaime Harrison.\n\nHarris and Walz will attend church on Sunday in the battleground states of Georgia and Michigan. Harris will also sit down for an interview with the Rev Al Sharpton that will air on Sunday night on his MSNBC programme, according to a Harris campaign official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss schedule details not yet officially announced.\n\nDonald Trump election news\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s transition team is reportedly preparing a blacklist of potential officials to be banned from a future administration , with special emphasis placed on those with links to the radical Project 2025 plan to overhaul the US government. The former president\u2019s eldest son, Donald Jr, is spearheading the drive to compile the list of barred staffers, according to Politico, citing a former official in the first Trump administration.\n\nTrump was joined at the Al Smith event by his wife, Melania, who has been an infrequent presence on the campaign trail. The white-tie dinner raises millions of dollars for Catholic charities and has traditionally offered candidates from both parties the chance to trade lighthearted barbs, poke fun at themselves, and show that they can get along \u2013 or at least pretend to \u2013 for one night in the election\u2019s final stretch.\n\nGaffigan referenced allegations that the Trump Organization in the 1970s discriminated against Black renters in its buildings . \u201cIf vice-president Harris wins this election, not only would she be the first female president, a Black woman would occupy the White House, a former Trump residence,\u201d Gaffigan said. \u201cObviously you wouldn\u2019t be renting to her. I mean, that would never happen anyway. Maybe if Doug did the signing.\u201d\n\nElsewhere on the campaign trail, a Nevada man who was arrested with guns at a security checkpoint outside a Trump rally in the southern California desert has filed a lawsuit accusing the sheriff of falsely characterising his arrest as a thwarted assassination attempt, for the sheriff\u2019s own personal gain.\n\nThe Republican vice-presidential candidate, JD Vance, falsely told a reporter on Wednesday that there were \u201cserious problems\u201d in the 2020 election and suggested that the then president, Donald Trump, did not actually lose the race. \u201cDid Donald Trump lose the election? Not by the words that I would use,\u201d Vance said in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. \u201cBut look, I really couldn\u2019t care less if you agree with me or disagree with me on this issue.\u201d\n\nOther election news:\n\nThe Nevada Democratic US Senator Jacky Rosen and Republican challenger Sam Brown painted each other as extremists on Thursday night in the presidential battleground state where the election could determine control of both the White House and the Senate. The election pits Rosen, a first-term senator seen as a political consensus-builder, against Brown, a retired army captain who bears scars from battlefield injuries and is endorsed by Trump.\n\nSenior Democrats in US cities are preparing to defend their communities in the event of Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House after the former president repeated threats that he would use presidential powers to seize control of major urban centres. Trump has proposed deploying the military inside major cities largely run by Democrats to deal with protesters or to crush criminal gangs. He has threatened to dispatch large numbers of federal immigration agents to carry out mass deportations of undocumented people.\n\nRead more about the 2024 US election:",

        "text": "The US presidential election is now a toss-up\nThe US presidential election is now a toss-up\n\nFri, 18th Oct 2024\n\nThe US presidential race has become extremely close, with the contest between the Democratic vice-president, Kamala Harris, and the Republican former president, Donald Trump, having settled into a statistical tie.\n\nWe now believe that the election will be a toss-up, marking a shift from our previous (high-risk) forecast that Mr Trump would win. The final result will be extremely close, and vote-counting delays mean that a winner will probably not be clear right after Election Day.\n\nUndecided voters and the composition of turnout in the battleground states will ultimately decide the election, with the US economy, women\u2019s healthcare rights and the Middle East conflict among the most likely factors to shape voter behaviour.\n\nA divided Congress remains most likely, regardless of the presidential election result. This would present greater obstacles to Ms Harris than to Mr Trump if Republicans retake the Senate (the upper house), as we assume.\n\nWith about two weeks left until Election Day on November 5th, the races that will decide which party controls the US presidency and Congress remain extremely close. This article outlines our latest forecasts on these elections, noting any updates from our previous election calls and our reasoning for making those changes.\n\nMs Harris and Mr Trump now have equal chances of winning\n\nWe now believe that the presidential election will be a toss-up between Ms Harris and Mr Trump. This marks a shift from our previous forecast of a Trump win, which we had set just before Ms Harris entered the race in late July, although we had always qualified our election call as high risk. Since launching her campaign, Ms Harris has erased the wide and stable polling leads that Mr Trump had developed against the Democratic incumbent and previous presidential candidate, Joe Biden. However, her meteoric rise has hit a ceiling in recent weeks, with polls between her and Mr Trump having settled into a statistical tie.\n\nMs Harris continues to hold her months-long lead in the national polls, although by a thin 1-3-point margin, which may actually be narrower given that polls have tended to undercount votes for Mr Trump. Meanwhile, she and Mr Trump each hold leads in about half of the seven battleground states that will decide the Electoral College vote and hence the election\u2019s ultimate winner. Those leads vary across polls but consistently sit well within the margin of error, meaning that most (if not all) of these states remain in play for both candidates, including absolutely critical states like Pennsylvania. With no further presidential debates scheduled (Mr Trump has refused) and most voters already set in their voting intentions, we expect that the race will remain in deadlock right up until Election Day.\n\nWhat factors could determine the outcome?\n\nThe outcome of the presidential election will be determined by a small number of undecided voters and turnout in the battleground states. Decisions about who to vote for and who shows up will have the greatest impact on the Electoral College results. The election\u2019s trajectory will remain vulnerable to many factors, including unexpected events, that could shape the opinions of these voters between now and Election Day. We feature below three such factors that we are watching most closely, and how we believe each will favour either candidate.\n\nThe US economy (neutral): The economy has long topped the list of voter concerns, with the cost of living and jobs attracting the most interest. This benefited Mr Trump for most of the campaign, particularly when Mr Biden was the Democratic candidate and inflation remained stubbornly high. However, Ms Harris has managed to erode this advantage, even pulling ahead of Mr Trump in some recent polls on the economy. Strong economic growth and labour market data published over the past month have worked to her advantage, as has the recent decision by the Federal Reserve (Fed, the central bank) to begin cutting interest rates as inflation continues to ease\u2013the next Fed meeting is right after the election. The release of additional growth and employment data in the next few days could further shape voter opinion, and our expectation of solid GDP growth in the third quarter is likely to give Ms Harris a boost. Meanwhile, Mr Trump will have to contend with growing voter scepticism towards his economic policies, which we believe would be inflationary and would slow growth. The often surprising jobs data due out the Friday prior to the election could sway voter opinion. However, early voting in key states such as Arizona, Georgia and Michigan, and in some counties in Pennsylvania, suggests that substantial votes may already have been cast by the time the data are released.\n\nThe economy has long topped the list of voter concerns, with the cost of living and jobs attracting the most interest.

However, early voting in key states such as Arizona, Georgia and Michigan, and in some counties in Pennsylvania, suggests that substantial votes may already have been cast by the time the data are released. Women\u2019s healthcare rights (favours Ms Harris): Reproductive health remains a top voter concern. The issue has expanded beyond abortion rights to encompass healthcare access for women, including treatment for miscarriages, as well as obtaining contraceptives and fertility treatments. The issue has proven to be an asset to Democrats, having helped to generate surprise victories at the 2022 midterms and the 2023 state elections, particularly by mobilising young, female and independent voters and encouraging voter turnout. We expect Ms Harris to benefit similarly, given her unwavering support for women\u2019s healthcare rights, her plans to restore federal abortion protections (although this would face obstacles in Congress) and her likely efforts to appoint liberal judges, potentially to the Supreme Court. Mr Trump\u2019s own muddled approach to the issue (his stance on a proposed federal abortion ban remains unclear) will only help Ms Harris further. Ballot measures on abortion access, which several states will vote on during the election, should give her with an additional boost by increasing voter turnout among likely Harris voters in some key toss-up states. Arizona, Florida and Nevada are among the states that will be holding these referendums. If the measures help to generate turnout for the Democrats, particularly on the back of a large campaign spending push, Ms Harris\u2019s performance in these states could end up stronger than current polls suggest.\n\nReproductive health remains a top voter concern.

If the measures help to generate turnout for the Democrats, particularly on the back of a large campaign spending push, Ms Harris\u2019s performance in these states could end up stronger than current polls suggest. Middle East conflict (favours Mr Trump): Now in its second year, the Israel-Hamas war continues to weigh on Democrats\u2019 electoral chances, working to Mr Trump\u2019s advantage. The continuation of the conflict and its recent expansion into Lebanon have allowed Mr Trump to sharpen his attacks against the Biden administration\u2019s (and Ms Harris\u2019s) handling of US foreign policy. (The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, which has divided voter opinion, has had a similar effect.) Meanwhile, Ms Harris\u2019s continued alignment with Mr Biden\u2019s support for Israel, despite her strong emphasis on the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, has compromised her standing with Arab/Muslim voters, who traditionally vote Democrat as a bloc. This is particularly a liability in the battleground state of Michigan, which Mr Biden won in the 2020 election and houses the country\u2019s largest Arab-American population. The state\u2019s \u201cuncommitted\u201d movement, which protested Mr Biden\u2019s candidacy over his approach to the war, has refused to endorse Ms Harris, although it also opposes Mr Trump. We assume that some Arab/Muslim voters will still vote for Ms Harris, owing to Mr Trump\u2019s more staunchly pro-Israel stance and his anti-Muslim rhetoric. However, Ms Harris\u2019s inability to rely fully on this voting group will complicate her path to an election victory. If the conflict in the Middle East intensifies, which we view as a moderate risk scenario, her chances could dim even further.\n\nRegardless of whether Ms Harris or Mr Trump wins the election, we expect the result to be extremely close. With some states, including Georgia and Pennsylvania, not reporting their full results on Election Day owing to rules around when and how votes are counted, it could take several days before the final winner is clear. Mr Trump in particular has refused to confirm that he would accept an election loss. With two key states not reporting full results until after Election Day, Mr Trump will have a window to declare victory if he so chooses. This is because Ms Harris is unlikely to have a sufficient number of Electoral College votes to win without Georgia or Pennsylvania in the mix. Such a scenario would generate political instability, and the risk of a negative market response would be high.\n\nA divided Congress remains most likely\n\nWe continue to believe that neither Democrats nor Republicans will win commanding majorities in the next Congress, regardless of the presidential election results. Intense voter polarisation and a small number of competitive races mean that the parties will have little opportunity to expand their current wafer-thin margins; Democrats now control the Senate, while Republicans hold the House of Representatives (the lower house), both by a handful of seats. The next president will therefore be unable to translate their full policy agenda into legislation. However, the exact party split between the two chambers will matter (even if majorities remain slim), creating distinct scenarios for whichever party controls the presidency. We believe that two scenarios are most likely.\n\nMajorities flip\u2014Democrats take the House and Republicans take the Senate (55% probability): The 2024 electoral map favours the current minority parties in both chambers. Republicans are certain to gain a Senate seat in West Virginia, a deeply conservative state, now that Joe Manchin, a Democrat-turned-independent, is retiring. That puts Republicans just one seat away from retaking the chamber, and this will probably come via a win in Montana, where the Democratic incumbent, John Tester, faces an uphill battle. Meanwhile, Democrats appear well positioned to flip the few seats needed to control the House; the importance of races in California, a blue state where Ms Harris was senator, and a likely rally effect around issues like abortion, as occurred during the 2022 midterms, will work in the party\u2019s favour. Another divided government will mean that even basic legislation, including to fund the federal government and avoid a disruptive default, will face partisan gridlock and delays. Neither Ms Harris nor Mr Trump would have much prospect for implementing their legislative agendas. However, Ms Harris would face the bigger burden , given that a Republican Senate would block any cabinet or judicial appointments that it deems too progressive; conversely, Mr Trump\u2019s appointments would face little obstruction. This would carry important implications for the ideological balance of the Supreme Court if a vacancy emerges before the 2026 midterms.\n\nThe 2024 electoral map favours the current minority parties in both chambers.

Trifecta sweep\u2014single party takes the presidency, House and Senate (45% probability): Although less likely, it remains very possible that the winning party in the presidential election will also take full control of Congress. This has been the norm since 1989, and the potential for upsets (particularly in the Florida, Nebraska and Texas Senate races, or in some California House contests) will keep this possibility alive. We believe that Ms Harris and Mr Trump would have equal chances of such an outcome. The absence of large congressional majorities would prevent either candidate from enacting the more partisan elements of their agendas, for example a rise in the corporate tax rate by Ms Harris, or a repeal of the Affordable Care Act under Mr Trump. However, the more moderate elements of their platforms would have an easier time passing, particularly if bipartisan agreement is possible. This could include Ms Harris\u2019s proposed cost-of-living controls or extensions to some of Mr Trump\u2019s previous tax cuts.\n\nThe analysis featured in this article can be found in EIU\u2019s Country Analysis service.

        "text": "In This Presidential Campaign, Disinformation May Be the Winner\nIf you propose that the government should somehow control information on social media, \u201cyou immediately run into these massive First Amendment problems,\u201d she said. \u201cLies are not great in lots of contexts. They are legal.\u201d\n\nIn particular, speech that is considered political receives high levels of protection under the First Amendment, so the platforms don\u2019t want to touch it, Wolff said. But more and more topics\u2014such as information about COVID-19\u2014have become politicized. Therefore \u201ceverything very quickly becomes political speech\u201d that the platforms let stand, she said.\n\nIf the government can\u2019t criminalize disinformation, Wolff said, the remaining options for social media platforms may be to label the disinformation and try to deprecate it with an algorithm that makes it visible to fewer people. But \u201cactually removing it, I think, becomes politically tricky for the platforms and legally very tricky for a lot of governments.\u201d\n\nPeople can\u2019t always tell truth from fiction.\n\nWhile we might hope that informed citizens in a democracy can identify disinformation on their social media feeds and elsewhere, evidence suggests that people in fact can\u2019t distinguish between truth and fiction when it comes to this sort of manipulation, said Thomas Cao, assistant professor of technology policy at Fletcher.\n\nThere is no evidence that all citizens \"have the capacity to distinguish between what is true and what is misinformation,\u201d he said. This is \u201cbecause a lot of the misinformation we see on social media is specifically designed to cater to \u2026 a particular demand from a certain segment of voters.\u201d\n\nUnlike official propaganda from authoritarian regimes in other countries, which might be more obviously false or clearly designed to promote a specific political perspective, disinformation in the United States is often more potent because it \u201ccan be concealed as a reasonable viewpoint spreading some kind of information [where] the political agenda is not particularly obvious,\u201d Cao said.\n\nPolitically driven speech in the United States also can be regarded as \u201cjust freedom of speech of parties spreading their own agenda and nothing particularly concerning,\u201d he said. But \u201cif you mix truth and falsehood together when spreading this kind of information, I think that presents a unique danger.\u201d\n\nControlling information strengthens political power.\n\nWhile there are differing opinions about regulating content on social media platforms, political leaders clearly understand that the control of information is linked to power, said Monica Duffy Toft, professor of international politics, director of the Center for Strategic Studies, and academic dean at Fletcher.\n\nIn other countries, such as Poland before its 2023 election, government leaders have increased their power over the judiciary and the media and attacked the opposition as a way of consolidating control, Toft said. In such circumstances, \u201cno longer are fellow elites or citizens seen as loyal opposition challenging the state, but they become enemies of the state,\u201d she added. She pointed to how former President Donald Trump used the phrase \u201cenemy from within\u201d recently to describe Rep. Adam Schiff, a Democrat who oversaw the congressional investigation that led to Trump\u2019s first impeachment. Schiff is now running for the Senate.\n\n\u201cWe have seen this before,\u201d Toft said. \u201cThere is a playbook \u2026 [for how you] get control. You recognize the importance of the media information space, you use it and you frame and you lie and you do misinformation and you say it enough and people start to believe it. \u2026 And that systematic effort we\u2019re starting to see is really playing off in the United States with this election.\u201d\n\nToft said Americans tend to have too much faith in technology and to value freedom over regulation. \u201cBut I think in this case we need to really be guarded\u2026. Technology in the wrong hands, when it\u2019s not used by sage, wise people with good intentions, can really go awry. And I think that\u2019s where we\u2019re at.\u201d",

        "text": "Election Anxiety Is Real \u2014 Here Are Some Tips To Help\nIt\u2019s no secret that this election year has been a bit more tense than those in recent memory. It also seems like there is more at stake than there has been in years prior. The country is changing at a rapid pace and there are many issues, both domestically and internationally, that have made a huge impact.\n\nAll of these things, plus having a full load of coursework, bills to pay and other responsibilities, may become a bit overwhelming, and anxiety may get the best of you. We sat down with Smita Majumdar Das, executive director of Stony Brook University Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) and Behavioral Health, and picked her brain on a few things to do if election anxiety is getting the best of you.\n\nTake a deep breath: Majumdar Das explained that taking a step back and evaluating how important this is in your everyday life is the first step.\n\n\u201cAs human beings, we are anxious about things that sometimes never happen,\u201d she said. \u201cSo a lot of things, a lot of fears, stay in our head, and we catastrophize a lot of different things. Take a deep breath and remember that whatever happens, happens. We have very little control over it.\u201d\n\nMajumdar explained that while we do have some control over the voting process \u2014 we get to vote for the person we feel will do the best job \u2014 we have no control over how other people feel. As long as you made the effort to control what you could, then it is time to accept that you did your part.\n\nGive back: Majumdar Das said that finding a way to give back to your cause can help put the mind at ease in the lead-up to the election, and can help accept the outcome in the end. Perhaps looking into joining a young professionals club or finding out how you can get involved locally in the campaign for your candidate can help. Other times, looking within and reflecting on what you feel is a way you want to give back to society can be the route to go. It is a personal choice.\n\n\u201cSometimes, there is a very small or personal way you want to make a change, and to change your surroundings. Think about how you want to impact the world around you and find a way to do that,\u201d she said.\n\nPut down the phone, pick up a skill: While it is easy to grab the phone and \u201cdoom scroll\u201d or sit and read all of the headlines during your free time, if your feelings are already a bit uneasy or you feel your anxiety growing, begin monitoring your information intake. \u201cThe moment you go down that rabbit hole, you\u2019re surrounding your thoughts in a very, very narrow kind of way and you\u2019re not thinking of anything else,\u201d she said. Instead, try meditation, a quick breathing exercise or simply engage your mind elsewhere, like a new hobby or building up your skill set.\n\n\u201cFor example, if you like to cook, find a very difficult recipe and try to engross yourself into that cooking process. Try to engage in something that is fun or a skill you want to try to master; not too much of a cognitive load,\u201d Majumdar Das said. \u201cYou can\u2019t be thinking about politics and try to do something new or master a technique of your choosing.\u201d\n\nGo to therapy: If you have big feelings about something, there is no reason that therapy cannot be an option, especially if you\u2019re feeling stuck in that emotional state. Therapy, said Majumdar Das, does not have to be long-term, either. It can be episodic, meaning that when the problem has been worked through, therapy can cease.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re feeling stuck, part of therapy is exploring why you feel that way. It might not be the election; it might be lots of different things surrounding your life that already have you feeling stuck and the election is added on to it, like the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back,\u201d she said. Majumdar Das added that people are generally very resilient, and if something truly makes you unable to move forward, it may be bigger than just the election.\n\n\u2014 Emily Cappiello",

Rosen said she would work to lower housing costs and promoted her legislation, the HOME Act, which would direct the federal government to investigate price gouging of residential rental and sale prices. On how she\u2019d lower grocery prices, Rosen said that she\u2019s working with the Federal Trade Commission to hold Kroger to account in its plans to acquire Albertsons.\n\nBrown said the US needs to prioritize cheaper and more efficient energy, arguing that it will drive down costs. He then accused Rosen and Harris of driving up costs with prioritizing energy policies that reward green energy projects.\n\nThe candidates were asked about their parties\u2019 standard bearers\u2019 proposals to eliminate tax on workers\u2019 tips and who should qualify for this policy.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re receiving tips, then you ought to be\u2013 not have to pay taxes on those tips,\u201d said Brown. Rosen said that they should start with servers, bartenders and waitresses and address the sub-minimum wage, then we \u201ccan also have a discussion and analysis, and see if there other industries that also work heavily in tip.\u201d\n\nImmigration: Brown was pressed on whether he agrees with mass deportations as former President Donald Trump has promised on the campaign trail, and acknowledged it\u2019s a \u201cvery big logistical undertaking.\u201d\n\nRosen did not directly answer whether she believed that the next US president should keep some of the Trump administration immigration policies that were brought back by the Biden administration. She said that the first thing she\u2019d pass is the bipartisan border security agreement that was blocked in Congress earlier this year.\n\nShe then criticized Trump\u2019s plans for mass deportations, saying, \u201cHow would that happen? Mass deportations? Who would get caught in that? How many innocent people would get rounded up?\u201d\n\nBrown asked to clarify stance on Yucca Mountain: Brown insisted that he hasn\u2019t change his position on the Yucca Mountain nuclear depository when asked about his comments back in 2022 where he suggested that it could be \u201can incredible opportunity\u201d and another source of revenue for Nevada.",

        "text": "AI\u2019s influence on the 2024 US election: a threat to democracy?\nAs the 2024 US presidential election draws ever closer, the discussion about artificial intelligence (AI) influencing political discourse has become increasingly pertinent.\n\nFrom generative AI (GenAI) creating deepfakes of political figures to suggestions of AI-driven surveillance at ballot boxes, concern about the potential for AI to disrupt the democratic process is deepening.\n\nElection officials, cybersecurity experts, and tech leaders are rigorously raising the alarm about the sophistication of AI\u2019s threats to election integrity, voter privacy, and public trust in democratic institutions.\n\nEvolution of AI: from tool to threat\n\n\u201cWe did have AI during the last election, but it wasn\u2019t as sophisticated as it is today. Advances in AI, such as generative AI or deepfakes, have evolved from mere misinformation into sophisticated tools of deception,\u201d says Dr Srinivas Mukkamala, chief product officer at Ivanti.\n\n\u201cAI has made it increasingly challenging to distinguish between genuine and fabricated information,\u201d Mukkamala adds.\n\nA recent study by Ivanti, an IT security and systems management company, revealed that 54% of office workers were unaware that AI can impersonate anyone\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cThis statistic is concerning,\u201d says Mukkamala, \u201cconsidering these individuals will be participating in the upcoming election. We cannot risk critical decisions being influenced by disinformation.\u201d\n\nPaul Teather, CEO of the AI-powered market intelligence platform Amplyfi, elaborates on this, explaining how GenAI has \u201cdemocratised\u201d the ability to create fake content, as it has become easier and requires less skill to pull off.\n\n\u201cThere have already been numerous examples of this, including some by candidates and their campaigns, e.g. Taylor Swift endorsing Trump.\n\nRead more: Trump and Musk rank as the most deepfaked figures ahead of the 2024 US election\n\n\u201cPeople no longer need a photography studio to create near-flawless images based just on their ideas,\u201d Teather continues, adding that this has led to a proliferation of AI-generated disinformation.\n\n\u201cThis increases both the tolerance of GenAI (it is seen as normal, rather than evil) and better recognition of it (people checking GenAI images\u2019 hands for errors).\u201d\n\nHe continues that while voters are improving at recognising telltale signs of AI manipulation, the sheer volume of disinformation has become overwhelming.\n\nAI-driven misinformation and the weaponisation of disinformation\n\nAccording to Simon Horswell, senior fraud specialist at Onfido, this proliferation of fake content is evidenced by a 3000% increase in deepfake attempts in 2023.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a real, concerning uptick of fraudsters using deepfakes to trick businesses and mislead consumers,\u201d he says.\n\nThis explosion of AI-driven fake content is creating new avenues for voter manipulation; Horswell adds: \u201cDeepfakes have become a vector to produce fraud at scale.\u201d\n\nWith AI-generated videos and articles becoming increasingly convincing, fraudsters and political actors alike can use these technologies to spread disinformation at an unprecedented scale.\n\nDr Ilia Kolochenko, CEO of ImmuniWeb, emphasises that AI can create millions of \u201cmalicious brainwashing messages\u201d, which can be disseminated across social media platforms, further amplifying these efforts.\n\nThis trend might be particularly concerning in the context of the US election, where small margins can tip swing states.\n\nThese AI-generated narratives have the potential to significantly alter voter perceptions, especially in an environment where social media algorithms prioritise engagement over accuracy, according to Amplyfi CEO Paul Teather.\n\nAI-driven surveillance and the erosion of privacy\n\nBeyond disinformation, True the Vote, a group known for election denialism, is threatening the use of AI-driven cameras to monitor ballot drop boxes across various states.\n\nThis initiative, which has been dubbed a ballot box \u201csurveillance reality show,\u201d aims to live-stream footage of voters in the name of transparency.\n\nHowever, local officials warn that this type of surveillance could lead to voter intimidation, particularly among marginalised communities, and raise serious privacy concerns.\n\nPaul Bischoff, consumer privacy advocate at Comparitech, argues that \u201cthe problem with the conspiracy group monitoring ballot boxes is not the use of AI, but the camera surveillance itself.\u201d\n\nHe notes that some voters might choose not to vote if they know they\u2019re being watched.\n\nThe ethical implications of AI surveillance go beyond privacy concerns; they also call into question the fairness and integrity of the electoral process.\n\nChris Hauk, consumer privacy advocate at Pixel Privacy, expresses concern over conspiracy groups\u2019 potential use of AI.\n\n\u201cWhile AI will certainly be used as a weapon during the election season, I believe it will likely be limited to using deepfake videos, photos, and audio to push voters in the direction the fakers are promoting. We\u2019ve already seen AI-generated videos on the internet that paint both US presidential candidates in an unfavourable light.\n\nEvidence that deepfakes can swing the vote is still lacking\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unclear what \u2018AI-driven\u2019 video monitoring will involve, but statements like these from groups like True the Vote could simply be an attempt to scare some voters from voting,\u201d Hauk explains. \u201cWe may see similar attempts by both sides as they work to tailor the vote total to their needs.\u201d\n\nIs AI also the solution?\n\nWhile using AI for nefarious ends is problematic, it may also be part of the solution. Simon Horswell describes an \u201cAI vs AI\u201d battle, where advanced AI systems are trained to detect and combat deepfakes and AI-generated misinformation.\n\nAI\u2019s ability to learn and adapt continuously is one of its key strengths. That\u2019s why training on large datasets of both real and fake media is needed to provide advanced protection without impacting the user experience, Horswell argues.\n\n\u201cCompanies can train AI algorithms to recognise the subtle differences between authentic and synthetic images or videos, which are often imperceptible to the human eye,\u201d he explains.\n\nBiometric AI-powered tools are already being used to verify the authenticity of images, voices, and fingerprints, offering a defence against the surge in AI-generated fraud.\n\n\u201cAI can automate the verification process and run comprehensive checks based on an individual\u2019s unique physical characteristics, such as facial features, voice or fingerprints.\n\n\u201cAI powers liveness checks, whereby the algorithm checks for facial movements, skin textures and micro-movements, and seeks to identify abnormalities such as unnatural blinking patterns or lip movements found in deepfakes,\u201d Horswell outlines.\n\nSimilarly, Lewis Duke from Trend Micro advocates using AI-powered detection tools to combat deepfakes and misinformation.\n\n\u201cDetecting and combating AI-generated disinformation presents several challenges, but automated detection tools can identify discrepancies in content that humans often miss,\u201d he says.\n\nDuke notes that combined with public education efforts to promote critical thinking and fact-checking, these tools could provide a robust defence against AI-driven disinformation in the election cycle.\n\nAI innovation vs voter privacy\n\nRob Shavell, co-founder and CEO of DeleteMe, points out that the availability of personal data online makes voters, particularly those in marginalised communities, more vulnerable to targeted disinformation campaigns.\n\nShavell explains that the primary methods by which personal information is utilised to disrupt voting processes can be categorised into two groups.\n\n\u201cTargeted misinformation, such as \u201cspoofed official statements changing location or date of voter\u2019s specific polling places,\u201d which we have seen examples of in both current and previous election cycles.\u201d\n\nThese deceptive tactics could be distributed through robocalls, text messages, and viral social media campaigns.\n\n\u201cAnd using elections as an opportunity for fraud: these tend to be similar spoofed campaigns claiming to be either aiding in voter registration efforts or soliciting donations on behalf of some local candidate.\u201d\n\nThese fraudulent activities are directed at specific groups, such as seniors, immigrants, and minority communities with limited knowledge of formal voter registration procedures.\n\n\u201cWhat has changed in the era of widely available personal data is the ability to micro-target specific audiences \u2014 particularly minorities and other at-risk groups \u2014 in a way that was previously more labour-intensive,\u201d he adds.\n\n\u201cBut there are few federal laws protecting people\u2019s personal information in the United States. Passing a National Privacy Law, like the ADDPA proposed in previous years, would go a long way to ensuring that the US can mitigate personal information risks associated with AI,\u201d Shavell concludes.\n\nSecuring elections in the age of AI\n\nAccording to Amplyfi\u2019s Teather, misinformation has always been indistinguishable from facts, but GenAI could tip the scales in ways we haven\u2019t yet fully grasped.\n\nTo combat this, experts like Chris Black, AI evangelist at Vizrt, suggest using technologies like C2PA standards, which track the authenticity of media content through encrypted metadata, ensuring content credibility and transparency in election reporting.\n\n\u201cGovernments and tech developers are taking greater steps to combat emerging threats and safeguard democratic integrity,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cHowever, at the same time, some governments have deployed facial recognition technology to profile individuals based on ethnicity, enabling tracking and detention. On a smaller scale, individuals equipped with consumer AI tools are exposing privacy vulnerabilities,\u201d he adds.\n\nRead more: United fakes of America\n\n\u201cHarvard students have shown how smart glasses (like Meta Raybans) can access personal information with just a glance, exemplifying how these tools can be misused.\u201d\n\nHowever, some steps can be taken to improve democracy in the future.\n\nDave Merkel, CEO of Expel, stresses that no company or government entity should consider itself immune to attack and that cybersecurity and vigilance are essential to protecting democratic institutions.\n\n\u201cAdversaries are already looking for ways to orchestrate attacks that shift opinions,\u201d Merkel says, emphasising the need for robust cyber defences to safeguard election infrastructure.\n\nMoving forward, Teather envisions a future where voters can rely on AI advisors to help them navigate the overwhelming flood of information they receive daily.\n\nHe explains that these AI systems would act as personal assistants, helping individuals filter out disinformation and make more informed decisions.\n\nBut this vision requires a combination of technology, regulation, and education. AI tools must be integrated with blockchain and decentralised platforms to ensure content authenticity.\n\nAt the same time, he adds, governments and tech companies must invest in media literacy programs to help voters become more critical of the information they consume.\n\nSo, what is the fate of the US election?\n\nDr Ilia Kolochenko summarises: \u201cSocial networks and other online platforms will probably play a huge role in the upcoming US elections.\n\n\u201cIf cybercriminals manage to outsmart moderation and content filtering mechanisms, we can expect a real and serious interference with the US elections and unprecedented threat to the democracy.\u201d\n\nRob Shavell predicts: \u201cEveryone is concerned about protecting voters on election day, and many localities are setting up barbed wire and bulletproof glass to enhance security. Unfortunately, most of the real damage will occur before voters even get to the polls.\u201d\n\nDr Srinivas Mukkamala concludes: \u201cWhen all is said and done, though, scepticism is the best defence against deepfakes. It is essential to avoid taking information at face value and critically evaluate its authenticity.\u201d",

        "text": "Majority of Americans Feel Worse Off Than Four Years Ago\nWASHINGTON, D.C. -- More than half of Americans (52%) say they and their family are worse off today than they were four years ago, while 39% say they are better off and 9% volunteer that they are about the same. The 2024 response is most similar to 1992 among presidential election years in which Gallup has asked the question.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nThe latest findings are from a Sept. 16-28 poll, which also finds differences among partisans\u2019 perceptions on this measure -- Democrats (72%) are much more likely than independents (35%) or Republicans (7%) to view themselves as \u201cbetter off.\u201d\n\nThe higher-than-usual percentage of U.S. adults who say they are worse off this year is largely owing to Republicans\u2019 much greater likelihood to say this than opponents of the incumbent president\u2019s party had been in prior election years. Likewise, the higher-than-usual percentage of \u201cbetter off\u201d responses in 2020, when Donald Trump was in office, was attributable to Republicans\u2019 much greater likelihood to give that response than supporters of the incumbent president\u2019s party did in prior election years.\n\nEconomic Confidence and Being \u201cBetter Off\u201d\n\nAmericans\u2019 perceptions of whether they are better off have been related, historically, to how they feel about the U.S. economy, as reflected in Gallup\u2019s monthly Economic Confidence Index (ECI).\n\nGallup\u2019s ECI summarizes Americans\u2019 evaluations of current economic conditions (as excellent, good, only fair or poor) and their outlook for the economy (whether they believe it is getting better or worse).\n\nThe index has a theoretical range of +100 (if all Americans rate current conditions as excellent or good and say the economy is getting better) to -100 (if all Americans rate the economy as poor and say it is getting worse). In Gallup\u2019s trend of these measures since 1992, the highest ECI score was +56 in January 2000, and the lowest was -72 in October 2008.\n\nIn 1992, a relatively low 38% of Americans said they were better off with the ECI at -37; and the incumbent, George H.W. Bush, lost. In 2004, when nearly half said they were better off and the ECI was +1, and George W. Bush won reelection. Similarly, 45% felt better off in 2012 when the ECI was -1, and Barack Obama won. Yet, in 2020, while 55% claimed to be better off and the ECI was -4, Trump lost his reelection bid -- a sign that noneconomic factors were paramount to voters that year.\n\nGallup\u2019s latest measurement of Americans\u2019 economic views, from an Oct. 1-12 poll, puts the ECI at -26 -- one of the worst election-year readings, along with the 39% \u201cbetter off\u201d reading from September.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nAmerica\u2019s Economic Confidence Remains Low\n\nThe -26 ECI reading in October is essentially unchanged from September.\n\nOver the past four years, Economic Confidence has largely been negative. In 2022, the index registered several scores that were among the worst since the 2007-2009 recession, as inflation reached levels not seen in four decades. During the past three years, Americans have named inflation as the most important financial problem facing their family. These findings suggest inflation likely underlies Americans\u2019 perceptions that the economy is poor, even against a backdrop of generally low unemployment, steady economic growth, and record stock and housing values.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nForty-six percent of Americans describe current economic conditions as \u201cpoor\u201d and 29% as \u201conly fair,\u201d while 25% say current conditions are \u201cexcellent\u201d or \u201cgood.\u201d Additionally, 62% say the economy is \u201cgetting worse\u201d compared with 32% saying it is \u201cgetting better.\u201d The latter figure has been the same since August, when Americans\u2019 optimism jumped seven points.\n\n43% Mention Economic Matters as Most Important Problem\n\nEconomic concerns figure prominently when Americans are asked to name the most important problem facing the U.S., with a total of 43% naming one or more economic issues, similar to September\u2019s 44%. Economic mentions were last this high in October 2022, and had not been above the mid-40% range since May 2014.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nThe \u201ceconomy\u201d in general terms (21%) and inflation (14%) are two of the specific issues most commonly mentioned as the most important U.S. problem, along with immigration (21%) and the government (17%).\n\n###Embeddable###\n\n44% View U.S. Job Market Favorably\n\nGallup asks Americans quarterly for their assessments of the job market. Currently, 44% of U.S. adults say it is a good time to find a quality job, while 50% say it is a bad time.\n\nThis month\u2019s \u201cgood time\u201d percentage is essentially unchanged from the prior measure in August, but is lower than readings taken between August 2021 and April 2024.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nSeptember\u2019s U.S. unemployment rate was 4.1%, similar to where it has been in recent months, below the historical average of 5.69% but higher than the record low of 3.4% registered in January and April 2023.\n\nBottom Line\n\nRonald Reagan famously asked in a 1980 presidential debate against then-incumbent President Jimmy Carter, \"Are you better off than you were four years ago?\" The question lingers as a standard by which each presidential administration is judged, particularly when incumbents are seeking reelection, and has been asked by Gallup in most presidential election years since 1992.\n\nWhile there are different dimensions that build a \u201cgood\u201d life, and these could make someone feel they are better off, the economy serves as a broad indicator of national health and directly impacts individuals' daily lives. Other research shows the relationship between the economy and personal wellbeing.\n\nHistorical trends suggest that perceptions of personal wellbeing and economic confidence can significantly impact election outcomes. With a majority of Americans feeling they are not better off than four years ago, economic confidence remaining low, and less than half of Americans saying now is a good time to find a quality job, the economy will be an important consideration at the ballot box this year. As inflation persists and economic concerns dominate voters' minds, the upcoming election may hinge on which candidate can best address these pressing issues.\n\nTo stay up to date with the latest Gallup News insights and updates, follow us on X @Gallup.\n\nLearn more about how the Gallup Poll Social Series works.\n\nView complete question responses and trends (PDF download).\n\n###Embeddable###",

        "text": "Here\u2019s how different the first presidential election was from 2024\nA different type of vote\n\nThe first U.S. presidential election occurred 235 years ago, in 1789. It was a small election (about 28,000 voters) without attack ads, noisy political conventions, assassination attempts and vice presidents taking over the campaign a few months before voters decide.\n\nCould you have voted for George Washington?\n\nIn 1789 only White men who owned property had the right to vote. Thirteen years after the American Revolution began in 1776, the nation had its first presidential election. Washington won in a landslide without having to campaign. After serving as commander of the Continental Army and president of the Constitutional Convention, Washington was a national hero.\n\nThe real race\n\nUnlike today, when a candidate nominated to run for president by their political party can select a vice presidential running mate, the vice president was determined by who came in second in the electoral vote. Between Dec. 15, 1788, and Jan. 10, 1789, states held elections and chose presidential electors, who according to the Constitution at the time had two votes. The Electoral College convened Feb. 4, 1789, and the election results were determined. Washington took the presidential oath of office April 30 at Federal Hall in New York City, the first U.S. capital.\n\nThe first candidates\n\nJohn Adams finished second with 34 electoral votes in 1789 and became the first vice president of the nation.\n\nThere were no Republicans or Democrats, only Federalists who favored the Constitution, Anti-Federalists who opposed it and Washington, who ran as an independent. Washington presided over the Constitutional Convention, which devised the federal government.\n\nNorth Carolina and Rhode Island had not ratified the Constitution and did not participate; New York did not choose electors due to an internal dispute.\n\nWashington received all 69 electoral votes. No other president has come into office with a universal mandate to lead.\n\nThere are 54 electoral votes in California in 2024, the most of any state.\n\nWashington was both a national hero and the favorite son of Virginia, the largest state at the time. Washington ascended to the presidency with the practical leadership experience of his Continental Army and Constitutional Convention roles.\n\nThe inauguration for this year\u2019s election will be in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 20, but Washington was sworn in during the spring. On April 30, 1789, Washington took the presidential oath of office. The chancellor of the state of New York, Robert Livingston, administered the oath to the first chief executive and exclaimed, \u201cLong live George Washington, president of the United States!\u201d\n\nThe 12th Amendment to the Constitution (ratified in 1804) mandated that presidents and vice presidents be elected together. Thomas Jefferson was the first president to be inaugurated in Washington, D.C. Jefferson simply walked to the Capitol for the oath-taking and returned to his boardinghouse afterward for dinner. After his second inauguration, he rode on horseback from the Capitol to the White House amid music and a spontaneous gathering of workers from the nearby Navy Yard \u2013 a procession that grew into today\u2019s Inaugural Parade.\n\nSources: National Archives, Mountvernon.org, Virginia Museum of History and Culture, electproject.org, Vital Statistics of American Politics",

        "text": "AP\u2019s presidential campaign tracker highlights how most American voters are sidelined\nA distinctive AP tool tracking every presidential campaign event highlights how the Electoral College leaves most American voters out \u2014 a reality told from one overlooked city.\n\nBy the first week in October, the presidential campaigns had made over 200 stops to try to woo voters ahead of November\u2019s U.S. presidential election. The vast majority of that impressive total were to specific counties in just seven states \u2014 the so-called battlegrounds. In all, the campaigns have been directing their time, attention and money to a cluster representing just 10% of all voters registered nationwide, an outgrowth of the U.S.\u2019s unique Electoral College system.\n\nThat data point was just one of many produced using a unique AP reporting tool developed by Democracy Team news editor Tom Verdin and multimedia journalist Kevin Vineys. Among many other uses, the tool helped power a story about all the other places in America left out of campaigning. Democracy Team reporter Christine Fernando, and Chicago-based visual journalists Melissa Perez Winder and Nam Y. Huh traveled to Waukegan, Illinois, a struggling, working-class city overlooked by campaigns despite being a short drive from the Milwaukee metropolitan area, a place that is visited routinely by presidential campaigns. Their story was told in text, a photo package and video, and the file embedded the interactive Vineys developed from the campaign tracking.\n\nThe tool is used several times a week for multiple stories about the presidential campaign, to add crucial context to AP stories. On a day when both Vice President Kamala Harris and Republican nominee Donald Trump were in Pennsylvania, AP was able to add a contextual graph showing that the state had by far the most visits by the campaigns this year \u2014 46. This gives the AP a competitive advantage, able to rely on our own reporting without having to rely on outside sources to show campaign trends.",

        "text": "2024 US Elections: Your Questions Answered\nOn 5 November, United States citizens will head to the polls to decide who will succeed Joe Biden as president of the United States : vice president Kamala Harris or former president Donald Trump.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo far, the debate has been heated and ugly between Republican candidate Trump and both Harris and Biden, the latter of whom only dropped out as the Democratic nominee in late July.\n\n\n\nIn the lead-up to the vote, here are all your questions answered.\n\n\n\nKamala Harris was born in 1964 and, after graduating from law school, began a long career as a prosecutor, eventually becoming California's attorney-general in 2011.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe launched a successful campaign for the US Senate in 2016 but failed to attract support during a short-lived tilt for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Biden selected Harris as his running mate and, after his victory against Donald Trump , Harris became the first African American and Asian person to serve as US vice president.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Who is Kamala Harris and what are her chances in the November election? SBS News 26/07/2024 07:06 Play\n\nWho is Donald Trump?\n\nDonald Trump was born in 1946 to a New York real estate tycoon and joined his father's business as soon as he graduated college, becoming the company\u2019s president in 1971.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis big media break came in 2004 with the reality TV show The Apprentice, which helped solidify his image as a savvy, tough businessman and contributed greatly to his public persona.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump's unorthodox political approach and ability to attract media attention helped him secure the Republican nomination and ultimately led to a victory over Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis push to build a wall along the US-Mexico border and his association with Russian President Vladimir Putin have both been controversial.\n\n\n\nTrump was the first president to be impeached twice but both times he was acquitted by the Senate.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince leaving the presidency, Trump has faced 91 felony charges across four criminal cases and is the first former American president to be convicted of a felony .\n\n\n\nWho is Kamala Harris' running mate Tim Walz?\n\nMinnesota governor Tim Walz is a US Army National Guard veteran and former schoolteacher elected to the US House of Representatives in 2006.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 60-year-old Walz is a self-proclaimed champion of \"progressive values\", and policies he has endorsed as governor have included expanding paid leave and free school meals.\n\n\n\n\n\nWho is Donald Trump's running mate JD Vance?\n\nRepublican senator for Ohio JD Vance rose to prominence after releasing a 2016 memoir focusing on his upbringing in Middletown, Ohio.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe was a critic of Donald Trump in the lead-up to the 2016 presidential election but began to recant his former statements about Trump while running for the US Senate in 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe is critical of mass immigration and opposes abortion , believing individual states should set abortion laws.\n\n\n\nWhy did President Joe Biden drop out of the race?\n\nUS President Joe Biden was the Democrats' 2024 presidential candidate until he dropped out on 21 July, several weeks after a widely criticised debate performance against Trump.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 81-year-old's performance in the debate sparked concerns about his mental acuity and resulted in calls from party leaders and donors to exit the race.\n\n\n\nAfter dropping out and endorsing Harris \u2014 who until then was his running mate \u2014 Biden said high-profile Democrats questioning his choice to stay in the race would have been too much of a distraction to his campaign.\n\n\n\nWhich states will decide the US election and why?\n\nSeven swing states have been identified as key to victory in the 5 November contest: Nevada, Arizona, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, North Carolina and Georgia.\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth candidates have roughly similar levels of support among voters in these states, meaning they could lean either way come election day.\n\n\n\nSource: SBS News In the 2024 election, some issues are more important in certain swing states; for example, the US administration's handling of the conflict in Gaza among Michigan's large Arab-American population.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, a key factor that unites the swing states in this electoral cycle is that they all have large populations in both urban and rural areas, which creates a strong political divide, experts have told SBS News .\n\n\n\nREAD MORE The seven battleground states that could decide the US election\n\nThe US Electoral College: Why winning the most votes doesn't make you president\n\nIn 2016, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton received almost 3 million more votes than Donald Trump \u2014 nonetheless, the latter became president.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's because US presidential elections aren't decided by the popular vote, but by the 'Electoral College' \u2014 a weighted system in which 270 of 538 electoral votes are required to win.\n\n\n\n\n\nStates each have the same number of electoral votes as they have representatives and senators \u2014 electoral votes do not correspond to population size in most states.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE This is how the US voting system actually works - and why it matters\n\nWhen is the US election, and when will we know the results?\n\nThe US general election will be held on 5 November 2024, a Tuesday. However, almost all states in the US allow citizens to vote early, meaning millions of Americans will have already cast their vote before election day.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn most states, mail ballots are counted on election day, either when the polls open or after they close. Regardless of when the count starts, results cannot be disclosed until after the polls close on election day.\n\n\n\n\n\nPolling places open in most states close by around 7-8pm (local time). That means it'll be the afternoon of 6 November (AEDT) when polls close and results start coming in.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe winner of the presidential election is usually declared on election night or the next morning, but not always. In 2020, it took four days before most broadcasters projected that Joe Biden would be the next US president .\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO INTERVIEW: Why do we often witness vitriol and personal attacks in US politics? SBS News 04/10/2024 11:18 Play\n\nWho can vote in the US presidential election?\n\nPeople can vote in a US federal election if they\u2019re US citizens \u2013 including citizens living outside of the US and dual citizens \u2013 who will be 18 or older by election day and have registered to vote.\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-citizens, including permanent legal residents, cannot vote in federal or state elections in the US and there are heavy penalties for non-citizens who try to vote, including jail time, fines and deportation.\n\n\n\nWhat has Kamala Harris promised to do if elected?\n\nHarris has made reproductive rights and personal freedoms a rallying cry and backs a national law codifying access to safe abortion.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn foreign policy, Harris is expected to stick largely to Biden's playbook on key issues such as Ukraine, China and Iran.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe has pressured Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for a Gaza ceasefire deal but has also taken a hard line against Hamas , saying the militant group must be \"eliminated\", and remains committed to the US policy of arming Israel.\n\n\n\nHer economic plans include tax cuts for most Americans, price gouging bans, more affordable housing and a new child tax credit as well as efforts to boost domestic manufacturing.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe has promised tougher immigration and fentanyl controls at the border.\n\n\n\n\n\nHer climate and energy positions are similar to those held by Biden, who made fighting climate change a top priority \u2014 even as US oil and gas production soared to record highs.\n\n\n\nWhat has Donald Trump promised to do if elected?\n\nOn foreign policy, Trump has vowed to fundamentally alter the US' relationship with NATO and to resolve the Ukraine war with possible peace talks that might require Kyiv to cede territory .\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the key issue of immigration, Trump has promised mass deportations, the expansion of a travel ban on people from certain countries and ending birthright \u2014 a constitutional guarantee of citizenship to persons born on US soil.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe has also called for migrants who kill US citizens to receive the death penalty.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO America's great immigration debate: what are both sides saying? SBS News 20/10/2024 15:07 Play\n\nTrump said he does not support banning birth control.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump has sought to distance himself from the sweeping Project 2025 policy agenda despite the involvement of his former aides and running mate JD Vance.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the economy, Trump has pledged to end taxes on tips and overtime, to lower corporate tax rates and to open federal lands to foreign companies and housing. He has also vowed to undo much of Biden\u2019s climate change work.\n\n\n\nIn early September, the results of a recent national Pew Research Center survey showed that the economy, gun rights, health care, abortion and migration were the most important issues for US voters .\n\n\n\n\n\nAround 61 per cent of voters said immigration is very important to their vote \u2014 up nine percentage points from the 2020 election. According to Pew's research, the issue is now much more important for Republican than Democrat voters.\n\n\n\n\n\nEighty-one per cent of registered voters said the economy would be very important in this year's election. Around 93 per cent of Trump supporters said the economy is a leading issue, compared with 68 per cent of Harris supporters.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor 65 per cent of all voters, health care is very important to their vote, while gun policy is a very important issue for 56 per cent of all voters.\n\n\n\nSupreme Court appointments are very important for 63 per cent of all voters and foreign policy is on the minds of 62 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nViolent crime is a very important issue for 61 per cent of all voters\n\n\n\n\n\nOver 50 per cent of all voters say abortion is very important, including 67 per cent of Harris supporters compared to 35 per cent of those who support Trump.\n\n\n\nDo Australians prefer Donald Trump or Kamala Harris?\n\nRecent polling has consistently shown that more Australians support Kamala Harris over Donald Trump.\n\n\n\n\n\nA YouGov poll from late August found 67 per cent of Australians would vote for Kamala Harris, while only 33 per cent would choose Donald Trump, if they had a say in the US presidential election.\n\n\n\nA September poll conducted by the Lowy Institute found that 73 per cent of Australians wanted Harris to become US president, compared to only 22 per cent for Donald Trump.\n\n\n\n\n\nWant more politics?

        "text": "What is gerrymandering in US elections? What to know in 500 words\nGerrymandering, the partisan redrawing of voting districts, is as old as the US and yet is still a controversial part of its elections.\n\nIt\u2019s been called vote-rigging, a power grab and just plain sneaky.\n\nBut it\u2019s legal, and both Republicans and Democrats do it.\n\nGerrymandering, the process of redrawing voting districts to favour political parties, is almost as old as the United States and yet still very much part of the modern political process.\n\nIn this year\u2019s general election, it could affect the outcome of crucial races for the US House of Representatives as well as state legislatures.\n\nHow does gerrymandering work?\n\nGenerally, once a decade, states update their voting districts to reflect population changes.\n\nThat\u2019s where gerrymandering creeps into the process. Political parties try to redraw the electoral maps to give their side the greatest number of seats in state legislatures and Congress.\n\nThe district boundaries are manipulated to put like-minded voters together or to split them apart, either amplifying or diluting their voting power.\n\nThe results are often contorted districts with meandering boundaries drawn to include some voters and leave others out.\n\nEssentially, gerrymandering allows politicians to choose their voters instead of the other way around.\n\nThe word was invented in 1812 when the governor of Massachusetts, Elbridge Gerry, redrew the electoral map for the state Senate to benefit his party.\n\nThe result was an oddly shaped district that looked like a salamander.\n\nIt inspired cartoonist Elkanah Tisdale to draw a mythical creature for the Boston Gazette, calling it the \u201cGerry-mander\u201d. The name stuck.\n\nForging complacent politicians?\n\nGerrymandering is controversial \u2014 and not just because it\u2019s a blatant grab for votes. Critics claim it can dilute the voting power of racial minorities and undermine democracy.\n\nA 2023 study by Harvard University researchers found that gerrymandering often creates \u201csafe\u201d seats for politicians, meaning their races are less competitive. In turn, those politicians become less responsive to the needs of their constituents, who become discouraged about voting as a result.\n\nAt least eight states have clear language in their constitutions against the partisan redrawing of voting districts. Others use independent commissions to make the changes. But the majority of states lack safeguards.\n\nNational efforts in the last Congress also failed to ban partisan gerrymandering.\n\nIn 2019, the US Supreme Court ruled it\u2019s up to state courts to deal with legal battles over voting maps.\n\nSo now, it\u2019s a state-by-state fight over the role of partisan politics in voting districts \u2014 with some recent rulings potentially affecting the outcome of the 2024 election.\n\nFor example, in South Carolina, a new voting map has turned a swing district into a safer Republican one, causing outrage among voting rights advocates.\n\nIn Louisiana and Alabama, meanwhile, newly drawn maps could mean at least one more House seat in each state for Democrats.\n\nAnd in North Carolina, the state supreme court ruled in favour of a gerrymandered congressional map, possibly giving Republicans three more House seats.\n\nEach of those races is significant: Control over the US House of Representatives is decided by district-level votes, with the fate of national legislation hanging in the balance.",

        "text": "US Election 2024 Live Updates: Trump criticise Kamala\u2019s absence at Al Smith Dinner, calls it 'deeply disrespectful'\n11:41 (IST) Oct 18\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump took the opportunity to make light-hearted jabs at his political opponents while addressing the annual Al Smith charity dinner in New York City on Thursday night. The event, which raises funds for Catholic charities, has long been a tradition where candidates from both sides can engage in playful banter.\n\n\n\nSpeaking at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel, Trump, known for his brash style, quipped, \u201cIt\u2019s really a pleasure (to be) anywhere in New York without a subpoena for my appearance,\u201d referencing his ongoing legal troubles. His comment was met with chuckles from the crowd, which included many of the city\u2019s elite.\n\n\n\nDuring his speech, Trump also poked fun at embattled New York Mayor Eric Adams, who is facing federal corruption charges, saying, \u201cGood luck with everything,\u201d in a tone that blended humour with sharp undertones.\n\n\n\nWhile Trump attended the gala in person, his opponent, Democrat Kamala Harris, skipped the event, opting to campaign in Wisconsin, a vital swing state. Trump took the opportunity to jab at Harris for her absence, comparing her to Democrat Walter Mondale, who missed the dinner in 1984 and suffered a major defeat against Ronald Reagan. \u201cIt shows you there is a God,\u201d Trump joked, sparking laughter and applause from the audience.\n\n\n\nHarris, however, still made her presence known through a pre-recorded video, calling for unity and understanding. \"In the spirit of tonight's dinner, let us recommit to reaching across divides, to seek understanding and common ground,\" she said.\n\n\n\nNot one to hold back, Trump continued with a more controversial joke, suggesting Harris might have attended if the charitable funds had been earmarked for \"the looters and rioters in Minneapolis\"\u2014a reference to the 2020 racial justice protests. The remark led to boos from parts of the audience.\n\n\n\nIn attendance with Trump was his wife, former first lady Melania Trump, making a rare political appearance alongside him. It was their first time together at such an event since the 2020 Republican National Convention.\n\n\n\nDespite the event\u2019s tradition of light-hearted self-deprecation, Trump struggled to poke fun at himself. \"Tradition holds that I'm supposed to tell you a few self-deprecating jokes this evening,\" he admitted. \"Nope, I've got nothing,\" a statement that drew mixed reactions from the crowd.\n\n\n\nThe dinner, however, is more than just an opportunity for political jabs. With Catholic voters being a key swing constituency, Trump sought to shore up support. Polls released this week show him leading Harris among Catholic voters in battleground states like Michigan and Pennsylvania by a margin of 5 per cent.\n\n\n\nAs the race between Trump and Harris remains tight, with the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll showing Harris slightly ahead at 45 per cent to Trump\u2019s 42 per cent, events like the Al Smith dinner serve as vital moments for both candidates to connect with voters and energize their base.\n\n",

        "text": "US Presidential polls 2024: Will Donald Trump be next US President? Here\u2019s what betting markets predict\nWith less than three weeks until the presidential election, polls show a tight race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. However, prediction markets tell a different story, with shifting odds reflecting the potential outcomes of the election. Political observers and analysts closely monitor these changing probabilities for a Harris or Trump victory.\n\nThere are increasing whispers that an individual or a group may be influencing Trump\u2019s odds on the betting platform Polymarket, having placed a series of substantial bets totalling $30 million, according to a report by Business Insider.\n\nWhat does the prediction say? Election Betting Odds, which aggregates data from the major markets, shows Trump has a 57% chance, the largest margin in his favour since 29 July, up from about 48% at the end of September.\n\nOther betting sites also reflect this trend: Betfair gives Trump a roughly 58% chance of victory, Kalshi at 57%, and Smarkets at 58%.\n\nOn Polymarket, the odds have shifted significantly, with Trump now holding a 60% chance of winning compared to Harris's 40%. This shift has been fueled by four accounts that collectively placed over $30 million in bets, as confirmed by Reuters, citing a source.\n\nThis has led political pundits and social media users to speculate whether certain high-profile Americans might influence these betting trends.\n\nMeanwhile, PredictIt shows a recent shift in sentiment, with traders now favouring Trump 54% to 49%. This marks the first time since late July that Harris has dropped below 50% support on the platform.\n\nStatus quo in swing states According to The New York Times, Pennsylvania is considered the most crucial swing state in this election, with its 19 electoral votesvital for both candidates\u2019 paths to victory.\n\nGroups supporting Trump and Harris are expected to spend over $138 million on TV and radio ads from late September until Election Day, and both candidates have dedicated significant time to campaigning there.\n\nPolling analysis from FiveThirtyEight attributed this importance to strong anti-Trump sentiments, broader acceptance of Biden among various Democratic voter groups, and a growing non-white population in the state over the past two decades. Generally, Asian, Black, and Hispanic voters tend to lean more Democratic.\n\nMoreover, former President Obama will join the Democratic nominee in Georgia on 24 October, while former First Lady Michelle Obama is scheduled to campaign with Vice President Kamala Harris in Michigan on October 26, Bloomberg reported citing a senior campaign official who requested anonymity.\n\nThe report further said that these get-out-the-vote events will be the first time Harris shares the campaign trail with either Obama during this election cycle.\n\nBloomberg reported that it will mark Michelle Obama\u2019s inaugural appearance in the battleground states for Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz.",

Chalkbeat and Headway at The New York Times will ask young people to share their insights and perspectives throughout the 2024 presidential election.\n\nThroughout 2024, Headway and Chalkbeat, a nonprofit news organization focused on education in America, have been in conversation with teenagers about the upcoming presidential election.\n\nWe\u2019ve asked these teenagers some big questions: How are you engaging with the election? Why are you engaged, or why not? What issues matter to you? So far, we\u2019ve heard from a broad range of students, from self-described political junkies to those more hesitant or uninvolved. In total, we\u2019ve exchanged messages with nearly 1,500 students nationwide.\n\nWith each questionnaire, we also invited students to ask us their own questions about the election. Here\u2019s a synthesis of what we\u2019ve heard from them.\n\nWhat are the candidates\u2019 policies?\n\nThe two major candidates, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald J. Trump, have very different records and plans. Maggie Astor, a New York Times reporter covering the election, contacted both candidates\u2019 campaigns and reviewed hundreds of interviews, statements, policy papers, bills, and agency actions to build a guide to each candidate\u2019s key policies.\n\nThe guide outlines both Trump\u2019s and Harris\u2019 stances on major issues like abortion, climate change, crime, democracy, the economy, foreign policy, immigration, and the Israel-Gaza conflict. Check it out here, and save the link, as more topics will be added in the coming weeks.\n\nHow does the electoral process work?\n\nWhile the specifics of what happens during an election cycle may vary, the overall electoral process \u2014 the steps candidates, campaigns, and voters take to prepare for and participate in Election Day \u2014 tends to follow a set order.\n\nFirst, individuals interested in running for president officially declare their candidacy. Campaigning can begin years before Election Day. These candidates, who aren\u2019t yet official nominees of any political party, campaign by holding town halls and rallies, competing at debates and doing interviews with news outlets. Eventually, the process leads to the primaries and caucuses, where voters select their preferred party\u2019s nominee. These primaries and caucuses occur on the state level, with each state having its own schedule and rules.\n\nFour years ago, Times journalists Sarah Almukhtar, Matt Flegenheimer, Umi Syam, and Eden Weingart created a guide to help readers navigate the intricacies of the 2020 presidential election\u2019s primaries and caucuses. Their definitions remain relevant today:\n\nPrimaries are reasonably straightforward: Voters vote, and their votes go to candidates who hope to receive more votes than the other candidates. Caucuses are like this in spirit, but with a dash of municipal sausage-making and D.M.V.-style chaos. Generally, supporters for various candidates sit or stand together in groups. A head count is conducted. And if a candidate doesn\u2019t reach a certain threshold of support \u2014 say, 15 percent of attendees at a caucus site \u2014 the group is deemed \u201cnonviable,\u201d and its members realign with other clusters before a final count is made.\n\nAfter the votes from the primaries and caucuses are tallied, each party coalesces around the winning candidate. Next, the candidates announce their vice-presidential running mates. Finally, the candidates head to their respective party\u2019s national convention, where they are formally nominated by the party\u2019s state delegates.\n\nThe conventions themselves are multi-day events full of speeches and presentations, nearly all focused on telling the story of the campaign to a national audience. More than 200,000 words were spoken at this year\u2019s Democratic National Convention and Republican National Convention combined. The Times reporter Jonathan Corum analyzed all those words, which you can check here.\n\nAs Election Day approaches, the presidential candidates continue to persuade voters through more debates, speeches, rallies, and media interviews. In many states, eligible voters can vote early.\n\nIn this year\u2019s election, early voting has already begun in many states, and voter registration deadlines have begun to pass in some. Here\u2019s a full guide to the key dates in each state. (We also received a lot of questions about how results are counted, which you can read about here.)\n\nOnce voting concludes, the ballots are counted in each state. This is where the Electoral College comes into play. In almost every state, the candidate who wins the most votes secures all of the state\u2019s electoral votes. (Maine and Nebraska allocate some of their electoral votes by congressional district). There are 538 total electoral votes, and the candidate who earns at least 270 is declared president-elect. The president-elect officially takes office at noon on Inauguration Day, which is usually on Jan. 20.\n\nWhy do we still use the Electoral College?\n\nThe Electoral College was a clear point of confusion for teenagers. In 2016, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote but still lost the election to Donald Trump because she lost the Electoral College. Teenagers wondered why this system remains a part of our electoral process.\n\nIn 2022, The New York Times published a comprehensive guide to the Electoral College. In this guide, the Times fellow Allyson Waller explained that although a majority of the public supports the Electoral College\u2019s abolition, it remains politically contentious \u201csince Republicans currently benefit from the electoral clout of less populous, rural states.\u201d\n\nShe continues:\n\nIn 2020, Gallup reported that 61 percent of Americans supported abolishing the Electoral College in favor of the popular vote. However, that support diverges widely based on political parties, with support from 89 percent of Democrats and only 23 percent of Republicans. One route to changing the system would be a constitutional amendment, which would require two-thirds approval from both the House and Senate and ratification by the states, or a constitutional convention called by two-thirds of the state legislatures. Some hope to reduce the Electoral College\u2019s importance without an amendment. Fifteen states and the District of Columbia, which together control 195 electoral votes, have signed on to an interstate compact in which they pledge to grant their votes to the winner of the national popular vote. The local laws would take effect only once the compact has enough states to total 270 electoral votes.\n\nIf you want to dive deeper into what fake electors are, how many electoral votes it takes to win, or if there could ever be a tie, you can read more here.\n\nFor this year\u2019s election, Times journalists Lily Boyce, Jon Huang, and Blacki Migliozzi created an interactive that allows you to game out how Harris or Trump could reach 270 electoral votes, depending on which swing states they win. You can play that here.\n\nHow do polls work, and can we trust them?\n\nMany teenagers had questions about polls. Times reporter Kaleigh Rogers broke down how election polling works here. If you\u2019re short on time, she also explains it in a video. Here\u2019s the gist:\n\nThe golden rule: Never put too much stock in a single poll. Remember that polls are a snapshot of how people were feeling at a particular moment in time; they are subject to error and are best understood in aggregate, such as through New York Times polling averages. But when you do want to understand more about a single poll, consider the so-called P.S.T. No, not Pacific Standard Time \u2014 take a look at the pollster that conducted the poll, the sample population surveyed, and the time frame in which it was conducted.\n\nNow that you\u2019ve been introduced to the importance of considering a survey\u2019s pollster, sample, and time frame, you can read Rogers\u2019 explanation for each of these terms in clear, easy-to-understand detail here.\n\nHow can I tell if the information I\u2019m consuming is accurate and unbiased?\n\nIn 2022, Times technology reporter Tiffany Hsu explored how teachers are helping students navigate a media landscape littered with misinformation. The article touched on a number of strategies that teachers and students can employ to improve their ability to find verified facts and mitigate bias.\n\nA New York Times Opinion article about misinformation by Charlie Warzel \u2014 later incorporated into a lesson plan from The New York Times Learning Network \u2014 argued that consuming accurate and unbiased information requires going beyond a single source. One teacher encourages students to remember the acronym SIFT:\n\n1. Stop. 2. Investigate the source. 3. Find better coverage. 4. Trace claims, quotes, and media to the original context.\n\nYou can find more resources here in the lesson plan from The New York Times Learning Network.\n\nHow are election results counted?\n\nThere are two main types of ballots counted during an election: in-person ballots cast at polling stations on Election Day, and absentee or mail-in ballots, which voters submit either by mail or by hand before Election Day.\n\nFor in-person voting on or before Election Day, voters go to designated polling places and fill out ballots.\n\nAbsentee or mail-in ballots, which in this election are starting to go out, are becoming more popular among voters. There are state-specific rules for when they should be returned \u2014 you can see your state\u2019s deadlines for registration and voting here.\n\nAt the close of voting on Election Day, all ballots are sent to state authorities for official counting. Each state has established procedures for processing in-person, absentee, and mail-in ballots. After all votes are tallied and certified, the state\u2019s overall result determines which candidate receives its electoral votes. Once a candidate reaches 270 electoral votes, he or she wins the presidency. The results are then formally sent to Congress, concluding the election process.\n\nIn 2024, for the second presidential election in a row, we may not know the winner until days after Election Day. One of those reasons is the rise in popularity of mail-in voting. In an article about mail-in ballot delays, Times reporter Nick Corasaniti explains why:\n\nCounting mail ballots takes more time because there are more steps involved. A variety of security measures, including signature verification and ensuring that voters did not also try to vote in person, are required. Election officials must open the ballots and flatten them before they can be put in a tabulator to be counted.\n\nCorasaniti adds: \u201cIf a winner is not declared on election night, it will not necessarily point to failures in the process. More likely, it will be a result of the intense security measures required for counting mail-in ballots.\u201d\n\nIn 2020, it took two weeks before every state was called. New York Times reporters Alicia Parlapiano and Lazaro Gamio explained how and why that happened here.\n\nStarting on election night, you can follow along with The New York Times as we process the 2024 election results reported by each state.\n\nHow do candidates finance their campaigns?\n\nCandidates finance their campaigns through a combination of donations from individuals, joint fundraising committees, political action committees (PACs), and super PACs. Each of these fundraising mechanisms has its own rules and contribution limits. Candidates may also lend personal funds directly to their campaigns. They can also receive large donations from wealthy individuals and organizations through super PACs, which can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money as long as they do not coordinate directly with the candidate.\n\nIn 2023, Times journalists Molly Cook Escobar, Rachel Shorey, Charlie Smart, and Christine Zhang examined the sources of funding for the 2024 presidential candidates. Although the article was published before Trump secured the Republican nomination and Harris became the Democratic presidential nominee after President Biden\u2019s withdrawal, it provides a clear explanation of how campaigns are financed.\n\nWhat is the role of foreign interference in this election?\n\nAccording to U.S. officials, Russia, Iran, and China have all engaged in disinformation campaigns, cyberattacks, and influence operations targeting U.S. elections. These efforts are an attempt to undermine public confidence in the U.S. electoral process, create discord, and sway public opinion. In the article \u201cCrunchtime for Election Interference: October Is the Month of Mischief,\u201d Times reporters David E. Sanger and Julian E. Barnes report that U.S. officials identify Russia as the most active threat, followed by Iran and China. To counter these efforts, U.S. officials have ramped up measures to protect election systems, especially against hacking and misinformation.\n\nThe scenarios that worry American officials are legion. While the actual balloting processes being used on Nov. 5 seem safer than in previous elections \u2014 97 percent of votes cast will involve some form of paper backup that makes recounts far more reliable \u2014 federal officials have been war-gaming the possibility that registration systems become locked up, perhaps in what may initially look like the kind of ransomware attacks that have closed down city services in Baltimore or Atlanta, or hit the Seattle airport.\n\nBut why are foreign agents interfering? Jen Easterly, the head of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, told Sanger and Barnes that these agents have common goals.\n\n\u201cThe two main goals are to undermine American confidence in the security of our election and our democratic institutions and to sow partisan discord,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cThose are the two goals of all our foreign adversaries.\u201d\n\nYou can read more about this issue here.\n\nWhat is the significance of swing states in this election?\n\nThe significance of the most competitive states in any close presidential election is monumental. Appropriately named, swing states are states with close polling and enough Electoral College votes to swing the election to one candidate or another. Swing states are again the main focus this year as Harris and Trump are essentially tied in the polls.\n\nPolls suggest that the presidential contest this year hinges on the results in seven states in particular: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. To explore how each of these states may influence the election, check this swing state tracker from Times journalists Lily Boyce, Lazaro Gamio, Eli Murray, and Alicia Parlapiano.\n\nWhy are third-party candidates not more prominent?\n\nThird-party candidates face significant challenges in gaining national traction in the winner-take-all system of U.S. politics, although some are competitive in state and local races. Restrictive ballot access laws, legal opposition from major parties, and concerns about vote-splitting limit their influence. In an article headlined \u201cDemocrats Prepare Aggressive Counter to Third-Party Threats,\u201d Times reporter Rebecca Davis O\u2019Brien touched on third-party candidates. She wrote:\n\nGaining access to the presidential ballot is a complicated and expensive process for candidates, particularly for those not affiliated with a party, even a minor one. Laws vary from state to state, with some requiring merely a fee or a few thousand signatures, and others requiring tens of thousands of signatures gathered under tight deadline pressure, along with other administrative hurdles. State rules limiting ballot access \u201censure that the people who are on the ballot have legitimate bases of support, and it\u2019s not simply a vanity project,\u201d said Robert Lenhard, a Democratic Party lawyer who co-led an effort to fight against third-party candidates. Independent candidates and third-party leadership see restrictive ballot laws, and efforts to monitor and enforce them, as anti-democratic, exemplifying the kind of two-party political machinations they say they are trying to combat. \u201cWhat are ballot access barriers? They are barriers against free speech,\u201d said Ralph Nader, who has made four third-party runs for president. He described state ballot laws in the United States as \u201cthe worst in the Western world, by orders of magnitude.\u201d\n\nEfforts to reform the system, such as switching to proportional representation, face political and structural challenges. Times journalists Alyce McFadden, Taylor Robinson, Leanne Abraham, and Rebecca Davis O\u2019Brien are tracking where third-party candidates are on the ballot here.\n\nFor a snapshot of third-party involvement in U.S. presidential elections, Darcy Eveleigh wrote a brief history in 2016 for The Upshot, detailing major third-party candidates and their eventual outcomes. And if you\u2019re weighing a vote for a third-party candidate on your own ballot, the Ethicist column in The New York Times Magazine offered some considerations here.\n\nWhat other election-related questions do you have?

        "text": "Europe's view of the U.S. Election\nEurope's view of the U.S. Election\n\nROB SCHMITZ, HOST:\n\nWith less than three weeks until Election Day, Americans are focused intensely on the close race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. Europeans are also watching closely. European leaders are focused on Russia's war in Ukraine and concerned about the long-standing economic and political ties between the EU and America. To help us dig into all of this, we're joined now by Markus Ziener from the German Marshall Fund, a nonpartisan public policy think tank that focuses on relations between the U.S. and Europe. Thanks for joining us, Markus.\n\nMARKUS ZIENER: Hello from Berlin. Thanks for having me.\n\nSCHMITZ: So, Markus, for starters, remind us just how close the U.S. and Europe are politically and economically. You know, how important is this relationship from a global perspective?\n\nZIENER: I think it became very visible when President Joe Biden was here just the other day. Germany is very much in sync with the U.S., whether it's security, whether it's the economy. I think the trans-Atlantic alliance really is a cornerstone, and I think that works very well, you know, with the current administration. So I think the concern is very much about those two big issues - security and economics - when it comes to the upcoming elections.\n\nSCHMITZ: Let's go into that a little further. You know, I know you can't speak for all Europeans, but, you know, what concerns would you say are top of mind for many Europeans, particularly European political leaders, when they're thinking about this U.S. presidential election?\n\nZIENER: I think there's three main issues. The one is security. The other one is economics, and then it's right-wing populism. And it all has to do with the fact that we already know what it means if Donald Trump is president because we already had one term with him, and we remember that it was very difficult in particular for the Germans to deal with Donald Trump at the time. It looked at if he had singled out Germany as an adversary, as an enemy, particular when we talk about security and how much Germany is spending on defense. He was criticizing Germany time and again for not doing enough. By the way, I think he had a point in doing so at the time.\n\nSCHMITZ: I was going to ask you, was that justified?\n\nZIENER: Well, to a certain degree, it was justified because Germany was kind of very lenient when it comes to our defense. We were believing that after the Cold War, we don't have to spend that much money anymore in propping up our defense, and I think we were very wrong. And the problem is not really that we did that. The problem is that we didn't wake up after 2014, after the Crimea was taken by the Russians? I think at that time, we should have known that this was a game changer and that we have to rethink our security policy, but we didn't.\n\nA couple of years later, I think we are in a different situation because Germany has, I think, at least to a certain degree, understood that we have to do more. But is this going to keep Donald Trump from criticizing Germany again for not doing enough? Well, it's not. No. The answer is no. Germany will be behind always in Donald Trump's eyes.\n\nSCHMITZ: If Trump should win the U.S. presidency this time around and let's say he is able to withdraw funding for Ukraine, what would that - how would that leave Germany and how would that leave the EU? Would - can the EU fill that gap of funding to help Ukraine defend itself?\n\nZIENER: I think the answer is pretty clear. It's a no. Europe will not be able to fill that gap. We probably can provide some more support for Ukraine, but it's not going to compensate for what the United States is giving to Zelenskyy and to Kyiv.\n\nSCHMITZ: Let's pivot to presidential candidate Kamala Harris. She is an untested leader, but I'm curious to know what you think European leaders think of how she would fare as U.S. president.\n\nZIENER: It's true we don't know that much about her. She was attending the Munich Security Conference earlier this year. And from that, we can take away that she is also an advocate of multilateralism, that she also said that she wants to move further when it comes to disarmament treaties and to negotiate. However, there are a lot of things we don't know really where she's standing.\n\nBut we can say, I guess, that she is - she will support the trans-Atlantic relationship, and she will not let down on Ukraine. I think this is something we know for certain, and she also will not withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement, like - Donald Trump did that when he was in power. So in a sense, we know those kind of big cornerstones there where we think that, OK, we can deal with Kamala Harris. When it comes to the details, I'm sure we still have to see how she - how this plays out.\n\nSCHMITZ: Europeans will be watching closely. That's Markus Ziener from the German Marshall Fund. Markus, thank you.\n\nZIENER: Thank you.\n\nSOUNDBITE OF JEAN CARNE ET AL. SONG, \"THE SUMMERTIME\")\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 NPR. All rights reserved.

        "text": "The Impact of the 2024 US Presidential Election on Southeast Asia\u2019s Markets\nThe 2024 US presidential election will significantly impact Southeast Asia markets, influencing trade policies, geopolitical strategies, and investment trends, with crucial implications for regional economies deeply tied to US-China relations.\n\nImpact of the US Election on Southeast Asia\n\nSoutheast Asia, noted for its rapid economic growth, is significantly impacted by US economic and foreign policy changes. The 2024 US presidential election, involving either a continuation with Democratic President Kamala Harris or a shift to Republican President Donald Trump, could greatly affect the region\u2019s economies. Key economic factors include trade, foreign direct investment (FDI), and security. As global risk consultancies like BMI predict a close race, markets and political analysts worldwide are watchful.\n\nShifts in Trade Policies\n\nChanges in US trade policies are crucial for Southeast Asia\u2019s export growth. Trade liberalization could allow the region to diversify export markets and reduce reliance on China. This shift would enhance Southeast Asia\u2019s role in global supply chains. Economies within regional trade frameworks, such as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), may experience increased integration with the US, encouraging stronger trade flows and better investment environments.\n\nTrade policies are a major concern for Southeast Asian economies, which have historically benefited from globalization and open trade with the United States. The region\u2019s export-driven economies, such as Vietnam, Malaysia, and Thailand, could face challenges if the new US administration implements tariffs similar to those seen during the US-China trade war. Such measures could undermine the economic stability of these nations, which rely heavily on exports to the US.\n\nGeopolitical Strategy and Balancing Acts\n\nUS foreign policy has been characterized by its strategic relationship with China. For Southeast Asia, the US-China rivalry presents challenges and opportunities. Regional nations have significant economic connections with both superpowers, necessitating a delicate balance in their international relations strategies to maintain positive ties with the US while managing their relationship with China.\n\nThe geopolitical rivalry between the US and China has long influenced Southeast Asia, with many ASEAN nations maintaining intricate economic relationships with both superpowers. The election could result in policy shifts that may require Southeast Asian countries to navigate the delicate balance between the US and China. This could disrupt integrated supply chains, especially in technology sectors like semiconductors and electronics, introducing new economic challenges for the region.\n\nRead the original article : The 2024 US Presidential Election: Impact on Southeast Asia Markets",

        "text": "Trump has gained in 538's forecast, but the election is still a toss-up\nThe closest election of the century keeps getting closer. Two weeks ago, 538's forecast of the presidential election gave Vice President Kamala Harris just a 58-in-100 chance of defeating former President Donald Trump on Nov. 5. Now \u2014 just 18 days away from Election Day \u2014 our forecast gives Trump the bare advantage in the race with a 52-in-100 chance to win.*\n\nYou might be tempted to make a big deal about our forecast \"flipping\" to Trump, but it's important to remember that a 52-in-100 chance for Trump is not all that different from a 58-in-100 chance for Harris \u2014 both are little better than a coin flip for the leading candidate. While Trump has undeniably gained some ground over the past couple weeks, a few good polls for Harris could easily put her back in the \"lead\" tomorrow. Our overall characterization of the race \u2014 that it's a toss-up \u2014 remains unchanged.\n\nThe reason our forecast is close is that the polls are close \u2014 well within the range that even a small polling error could be decisive. According to our polling averages, the margin between Trump and Harris is 2 percentage points or less in all seven major swing states (Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin). And in our average of national polls, Harris leads Trump by only 2.0 points. That is tighter than the margin between Trump and President Joe Biden on every day of the 2020 campaign, and tighter than the margin between Trump and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on every day between Oct. 1 and Election Day 2016. (Because of the Electoral College's bias toward Republicans, our model currently estimates that Harris likely needs to win the national popular vote by 2.0 points in order to be favored to win a majority of electoral votes.)\n\nFor the most part, recent high-quality polls have only affirmed the closeness of the race. An ABC News/Ipsos poll fielded Oct. 4-8 found Harris up by 2 points nationally. An Oct. 1-10 survey from Marquette University Law School, one of the most accurate and transparent pollsters in America, found her up by 3 points. The list goes on: YouGov/CBS News recently gave Harris a 3-point lead; Marist College gave her a 5-point lead; Fairleigh Dickinson University a 3-point lead. Fewer pollsters have given Trump a lead nationally, but there have been a few: Beacon Research/Shaw & Co. Research/Fox News found Trump up 2 points; Hart Research Associates/Public Opinion Strategies/NBC News put him up by 1.\n\nIn national polls, the race has been not only close, but also stable. In fact, Harris's current 2.0-point margin in national polls is pretty similar to where it was two months ago, on Aug. 18. The crosstabs have barely changed as well. For example, among Black and Hispanic voters, Harris's support has moved up or down by less than 2 points since she joined the race. Of course, those 2 points could be decisive, but it's remarkable how little has changed over the course of the campaign.\n\nState polls, however, have shown comparatively more movement \u2014 and most of it against Harris. Compared to her numbers at the start of the month, Harris has lost ground in all of the seven key swing states. This is why her chance of winning in our forecast has decreased. In American presidential elections, you don't get points for winning the national popular vote.\n\nAre partisan pollsters biasing our averages?\n\nOne question that we sometimes get is whether polling averages like 538's are biased toward Trump because of the influx of polls conducted by Republican-aligned firms. Over the past two weeks, 22 of the 113 presidential polls released in the seven main swing states were from a Republican pollster or sponsor, while none were from Democratic organizations.** (The remaining 91 polls were nonpartisan.)\n\nWhile there is always uncertainty about how accurate state polls are, partisan polls affecting our averages is not one of my bigger concerns. That's because we work hard to subtract potential statistical bias from each poll before putting it into our averages. As you can see in our polling-average methodology, we adjust partisan polls to account for the fact that these polls are typically a bit too good for the sponsoring party.\n\nAnd even for nonpartisan polls, we apply something called a \"house effects\" adjustment that accounts for how much more Democratic- or Republican-leaning a pollster is than its peers (whether due to the partisan leanings of its principals or, simply methodological choices that typically produce more liberal or conservative samples). For example, if a pollster's polls have consistently been 2 points better for Trump than the polling average, after controlling for factors such as a poll's population (likely voters versus registered voters or all adults) and mode (e.g., live phone, online panel, text message, etc.), we adjust those polls 2 points toward Harris.\n\nFinally, we give less weight to polls from pollsters without a 538 pollster rating and pollsters that release a bunch of polls in a short period of time. This ensures that pollsters that are \"flooding the zone\" with polls don't have outsized influence in our averages.\n\nOne test for whether these adjustments are working correctly is to see how 538's averages would look if we didn't include any polls from the firms alleged to be trying to influence the averages. The table below shows the results of this comparison. In the second column, you'll find 538's averages as of 4 p.m. Eastern on Oct. 18. The third column is what our averages would have been at that time if we removed those polls but otherwise ran the same algorithm we normally do:\n\nAs the table shows, this does not significantly change our averages. In most places, the pollsters in question are indeed more pro-Trump than other pollsters. However, this has just a mild effect on our averages, moving them toward Trump by just 0.3 points on average. (The biggest difference is in Pennsylvania, where our published average gives Harris a 0.1-point lead over Trump, but the nonpartisan average gives her a 0.9-point edge.) That's not a significant difference in a world where the average polling error in presidential elections is 4.3 points, and it's small enough that it could easily be attributed to sampling error or some methodological factor other than partisan bias. As a point of comparison, our averages regularly move by 0.1-0.3 points on a daily basis, and we don't recommend that anyone read into those shifts.\n\nGranted, this says nothing about the motivations of the firms (we like to stick to the data here at 538) or what's going on behind the scenes (we don't really know). What we can say is that, over the long run, polling averages that are more inclusive have typically overperformed averages that use a more restricted set of pollsters or an inconsistent methodology for weighting and making adjustments. One of the reasons we have all the rules and methods we do is to have trust in our work even when we have doubts; that means sticking to our rules even when we may be tempted to make an exception.\n\nImportantly, though, that doesn't mean that we should consume all polls without criticism or taking a closer look at how pollsters are generating their data. In this case, our empirical look at how our averages are operating is reassuring us that things are working as intended.\n\nWhat if the election were held today?\n\nIn conclusion, the presidential race is close no matter which way you slice it. This is both because the polls are exceedingly tight right now and because there is still uncertainty about how the final two and a half weeks of the campaign will unfold. As we have written, the race can change quickly in the final weeks. For example, in the last few weeks of the 2016 and 2020 campaigns, polls moved by about 4 and 2 points, respectively, toward Trump.\n\nThe value our forecast adds over our polling averages is that it attempts to quantify how likely such a shift is \u2014 and how inaccurate polls might be even on Election Day itself. But this also means that as the time remaining for people to change their minds decreases, the forecast's uncertainty about the race also decreases \u2014 and very quickly.\n\nBut because the polls are so tight right now, if they don't budge, the forecast won't either. If you run our presidential election forecast in \"nowcast\" mode \u2014 where we pretend the election is being held today and remove all volatility stemming from how many days are left until Nov. 5 \u2014 Trump still has a 52-in-100 chance of winning.\n\nFinally, I have to remind you that a close election in terms of the odds does not necessarily mean that the final outcome will be close. If the polls miss by a historically normal amount, either candidate could easily win with 300 Electoral College votes. While we can say that this is one of the closest elections in modern history in the polls, we can't guarantee that it will go into the history books as one of the closest in terms of votes.\n\nMary Radcliffe contributed research.\n\nCORRECTION AND CLARIFICATION (Oct. 29, 2024, 12:50 p.m. Eastern): This article originally said that over the previous two weeks, 23 of the 121 polls released in the seven main swing states were from a Republican pollster or sponsor, while four were from Democratic organizations and the remaining 93 were nonpartisan. The number of nonpartisan polls was actually 94. Those numbers also included polls of Senate and House races. Because the focus of this article is the presidential race, those numbers have been updated to reflect numbers only among presidential polls.\n\nFootnotes\n\n*All numbers in this article as of Oct. 18 at 4 p.m. Eastern.\n\n**Includes all polls added to our database from Oct. 5 to Oct. 18 at 4 p.m. Eastern. Partisan polls are defined as polls from a pollster or sponsor marked as partisan in our database, including internal polls conducted for a campaign.",

The U.S. has roughly 3.5 million Muslims from diverse ethnic backgrounds . The surge in political engagement is driven by a mix of factors, from a desire for political representation .",
        "text": "Muslim candidates surge in local elections in US\nAs the United States prepares for a presidential election next month, the idyllic New York suburb of Teaneck, New Jersey, is gearing up for elections that reflect a broader trend in U.S. politics.\n\nTwo Muslim women are running for local office in Teaneck, a town of 41,000 residents with a significant Muslim population. They are among hundreds of Muslim candidates in local, state and federal elections around the country.\n\nTeaneck once had a Muslim mayor but never a Muslim woman on its city council.\n\nReshma Khan, a longtime local activist of Indian origin and a council candidate, is aiming to change that.\n\n\"I don't take that lightly,\" Khan, 47, said in a recent phone interview from her makeshift canvassing base in Teaneck. \"It's one of great responsibility as a Muslim.\"\n\nNadia Hussain, a Trinidadian American high school teacher, is the other Muslim candidate in Teaneck's nonpartisan local elections. She is hoping to be the first Muslim woman elected to the local school board.\n\nKhan and Hussain, two hijab-wearing, everyday working American moms, represent a growing trend of Muslim Americans seeking office, reflecting a larger national pattern of more diverse candidates.\n\n\"There is a saying that we have: 'If you're not at the table, then you're on the menu,' so engagement is a must,\" Hussain said in an interview with VOA.\n\nMuslims' political engagement surges\n\nThe U.S. has roughly 3.5 million Muslims from diverse ethnic backgrounds. Though most vote Democratic, a growing number have leaned Republican in recent elections.\n\nMuslim elected officials, once a rarity, have become increasingly common in recent years. This surge in political engagement is driven by a mix of factors, from a concern about Islamophobia to a desire for political representation, experts say.\n\n\"If voter turnout of American Muslims is any indication of further political participation, Muslims running for office seems to parallel that trend,\" said Nura Sediqe, an assistant professor of political science at Michigan State University.\n\nSome experts trace the surge of Muslim political engagement to 2018, when Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib shattered glass ceilings by becoming the first Muslim women elected to Congress. Their success, coupled with that of numerous local candidates, ignited a wave of Muslim political activism.\n\nThe ripple effects have continued in the years since. In 2021, Boston and New York City elected their first Muslim council members. The following year, Dearborn, Michigan, a city with a substantial Arab and Muslim population, inaugurated its first Muslim mayor. Meanwhile, state legislatures from Maine to Texas have welcomed about 50 Muslim members into their ranks.\n\n\"Every cycle we're seeing an increase in the number of people running,\" said Basim Elkarra, executive director of CAIR Action, himself a school board president near the Sacramento, California, area. \"You're seeing more local races, more school board races and more city council races where folks are running in.\"\n\nLast year, CAIR, a civil rights group promoting American-Islamic relations, tallied 235 Muslim elected officials, including nearly 50 in New Jersey, home to the largest Muslim population per capita in the country. This year, the group expects the total number to surpass 250, a record.\n\nLocal races, like school board and city council elections, account for most of the recent growth. A city council member may not wield the power of a member of Congress, but in a country where \"all politics is local,\" these races can have a huge impact on local communities.\n\nRecounting her talking points to voters, Khan said, \"We say, yes, the presidential election is important, but more important is local elections.\"\n\nA consummate activist, Khan views a future role on the city council as an extension of her activism rather than a political position. Her goal, she said, is to inspire future generations of Muslim women.\n\n\"I'm not doing this for myself,\" Khan said. \"I am doing this for the Fatimas and the Muhammads and the Ahmads who are going to come 50 years from now.\"\n\nCandidate aims to challenge stereotypes\n\nKhan wasn't always a hijabi woman. Born in Chennai, India, she attended a Catholic school. After earning an master's degree in business administration from an Indian university, she moved to the U.S. in early 2001 to take a marketing job in New Jersey.\n\nThe terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, changed her outlook. To challenge stereotypes about Muslims, she began wearing a hijab.\n\n\"I wanted to show that there are peaceful Muslims,\" she said.\n\nNearly 20 years ago, Khan and her husband, Arif, moved to Teaneck, where she immersed herself in community activism: attending city council meetings, serving on the council's community relations board and leading a school Parent Teacher Association.\n\nThen in 2021, she was thrust into the spotlight after helping lead a ballot initiative to move local elections from May to November when turnout is higher. She credits her marketing skills for the success of the \"One Town, One Vote\" campaign.\n\n\"At this point, I had become such an icon in Teaneck, because even though the movement was not started by me, I brought my marketing skills,\" she said.\n\nThe following year, she considered running for town council but decided to wait while she was raising three young daughters.\n\nThis year, though, she took the plunge, inspired by the historic victories of several Muslim women candidates in New Jersey and a sense the council wasn't listening to her community.\n\n\"I felt that I should be the leader for my community, so my community finds a voice in American politics,\" she said.\n\nTeaneck is an ethnically and religiously diverse town, with about 40% of the population Jewish, more than 20% Muslim, and the rest mostly Blacks and Latinos.\n\nThe war in Gaza, ignited by Hamas' terror attack on Israel last October, sparked tensions after the council passed a resolution in support of Israel but not one \"designed to speak for Palestinian voices,\" Khan said.\n\nTeaneck's Muslims, Khan said, \"feel let down by the local leadership because the local leadership has only spoken for one community.\"\n\nTeaneck Mayor Mike Pagan did not respond to repeated requests from VOA for comment.\n\nA self-described \"bridge builder,\" Khan said she has formed a broad coalition of supporters from Teaneck's major communities, using young canvassers to go door to door.\n\nWhether that's enough to win remains to be seen. With local elections now held in November, winning a council seat requires substantially more votes. But whether she wins or not, Khan said she wants to be remembered \"as a woman in her hijab who's a Muslim and has galvanized support from every community in the town, not because she is a Muslim person but because she is someone who stands for equity.\"",

Why are long lines an issue in some communities but not others?\n\nQuestions like these have rankled some in recent years to the point of outright but misguided rejection of valid results.\n\n\u201cElection administration mostly happens in the background, and most individuals don\u2019t realize the United States is unique in that its electoral system is highly decentralized,\u201d said Michael Ritter, an assistant professor in the School of Politics, Philosophy, and Public Affairs at Washington State University.\n\nRitter continued, \u201cWe have 50 states that administer elections differently, with different registration laws and a lot of authority and responsibility extending down to county governments. So, if you\u2019re a voter who sees election events happening differently than what you\u2019re used to in other states, it can lead you to suspect that foul play is occurring, when in fact other states just have different election rules.\u201d\n\nThe different types of primary elections Elections administration largely falls to states and the counties therein, resulting in different voting experiences for voters across the country. Read more\n\nAs an example, Ritter pointed to the 2020 Presidential Election. Early results in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania favored Donald Trump, as in-person voters largely swung Republican. But projections swung heavily toward Joe Biden as time went by and hundreds of thousands of absentee and mail-in ballots were subsequently counted. Different states have different laws on when absentee or mail ballots can be counted, and Trump\u2019s lead in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin evaporated when these ballots were counted, which in these states can only begin on Election Day. Some individuals suspected foul play in these states, when in fact these developments were simply reflections of state election laws.\n\nHow states administer elections and the laws that govern those processes make a significant impact, not just in how quickly results are known, but in perceptions of the validity of elections. Their laws and processes, however, must comply with federal law and the U.S. Constitution.\n\nUnderstanding these differences, therefore, is critical.\n\nState vs. federal\n\nIn the earliest years of the United States, elections were irregular and less formal. White land owners showed up when an election was called and voted by saying their choice out loud.\n\nAs processes became more formalized, who was able to vote and how changed dramatically. Constitutional amendments provided previously disenfranchised people with the right to vote and eliminated barriers like the Poll Tax, which required would-be voters to pay money to register.\n\nThe federal government also enacted laws requiring states and municipalities make voting easier for elderly voters and those with disabilities. And in the wake of the 2000 Presidential Election, Congress approved the Help America Vote Act in an effort to streamline the voting process, update elections equipment and require states to create voter registration lists.\n\nThe authority of the federal government has been successfully challenged, however, as was the case in 2013 with the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Shelby County vs. Holder. That decision rolled back provisions of the Voting Rights Act, including the requirement that states and localities with a history of voter suppression seek approval from the U.S. Justice Department in making changes to election law.\n\nSeveral states responded by making changes to voter registration requirements and election law, prompting legal challenges by advocacy groups. The boundaries of voting districts and the potential for gerrymandering remain an oft-discussed and legally relevant issue for states across the country.\n\nPros and cons of local control\n\nIn a recent study, Ritter developed an index to evaluate how well counties across the country do administering elections.\n\nHe and his coauthor found significant variance in how well localities carry out their responsibilities, with non-white and less wealthy voters more likely to live in communities with fewer resources available to election workers. Fewer resources means it can be more difficult for these communities to produce educational material on the election and to count and certify results in a timely fashion. It\u2019s a job made even more difficult in some states that forbid the tabulating of mail-in ballots until Election Day.\n\n\u201cHaving millions of ballots to count in such a short period of time means it could take longer to know the outcome of an election and it may be more likely that election workers may make a mistake in processing a ballot,\u201d Ritter said.\n\nIt\u2019s imperative that election results be known quickly, as delays can depress voter confidence, Ritter added. These inequalities, as well as the chance that authorities wield their power against certain groups of voters, as was done under Jim Crow laws in the past, are major arguments in favor of a centralized elections system.\n\nA decentralized elections system gives states and localities the freedom to meet the needs of their unique communities. The dispersal of elections offices also makes wide scale fraud far less likely.\n\nOne bright spot, Ritter found, is that municipalities across the country, including many in Washington, are improving each presidential election cycle. They\u2019re doing this by providing more information and resources to voters as well as making it easier for voters with disabilities to cast their ballots. In Washington state, voter information pamphlets are distributed to millions of people for primary as well as general elections.\n\nOne advantage of the decentralized elections system is that states and localities have the freedom to meet the needs of their unique communities. A state like Alaska has to contend with a lot of land and a relatively sparse population, a set of much different challenges than a state like Massachusetts. And the highly dispersed nature of elections offices makes wide scale fraud far less likely, as Cornell Clayton, director of WSU\u2019s Foley Institute for Public Policy and Public Service, highlighted as part of the center\u2019s work on behalf of the Election Integrity Initiative.\n\nTargeting a decentralized system in hopes of influencing the results would mean infiltrating numerous entirely separate systems across dozens of states that are equipped specifically to deter this type of event.",

        "text": "Seeing them as current events and not really new \u2014 Harvard Gazette\nThe media keep calling the 2024 election \u201cunprecedented,\u201d said political historian Jill Lepore. They said the same thing about contests for U.S. president in 2016 and 2020.\n\n\u201cSince, I would say, the [2000] Bush v. Gore election, our political discourse is about falling off a cliff,\u201d Lepore, the David Woods Kemper \u201941 Professor of American History, told her students recently. \u201cIt has a weird torquing effect on how people experience daily life.\u201d\n\nLepore is one of three well-known scholars teaching the brand-new \u201cHIST 10: A History of the Present\u201d this semester. Co-created with professors Maya Jasanoff and Kirsten Weld, the introductory course uncovers historic concepts and clich\u00e9s that anchor perceptions of today.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to approach the present in this classroom as historians \u2014 as people concerned with how individuals and collectives situate themselves in historical time and, most importantly, how they make meaning of it,\u201d promised Weld, a Canadian-born historian of modern Latin America.\n\nJasanoff, the X.D. and Nancy Yang Professor of Arts and Sciences and Coolidge Professor of History, kicked off the first lecture with some history on the course itself. HIST 10 was once offered as a yearlong survey for actual and prospective concentrators focused on the Western world, especially Europe, she explained. But that framing slowly fell out of favor with students and faculty alike until the course was finally canceled in 2006.\n\n\u201cBut we felt, and continue to feel, that history is something we all need to be educated in and conscious of,\u201d said Jasanoff, a historian of the British Empire. \u201cAnd so the three of us started talking about re-presenting a gateway course to revivify the sense that history is integrated into our consciousness, our lives, our society, our government, and much more.\u201d\n\nThey designed a lecture course broken into three modules, each informed by individual interests and expertise. First Jasanoff is interrogating evolving definitions of ancestry. Lepore, who is also a Harvard Law School professor and New Yorker staff writer, will then lead a section on rights. And Weld will wrap things up with a unit on memory.\n\n\u201cWhat really drew me to the class were these conceptual frameworks,\u201d said Victoria Rengel \u201928, a Newark, N.J., native considering a joint concentration in government and history. \u201cAs the professors laid out in the first class, most human conflict can be broken down and understood through one of the three.\u201d\n\nEnrolled in the course are about 60 undergraduates, plus a sizeable contingent of auditors. \u201cIt\u2019s packed,\u201d observed A.J. Moyeda \u201927, a history concentrator with a secondary in philosophy from South Texas. \u201cI never imagined a history course with this many students.\u201d\n\nMondays begin with scholarly takes on the students\u2019 anonymously submitted questions. Wednesdays feature all three professors engaged with (and often debating) daily news. The first few conversations left Jacqueline Metzger \u201927, a joint concentrator in history and in Theater, Dance & Media from the Washington, D.C., area, rethinking how election coverage is packaged.\n\n\u201cI really liked the conversation about things being unprecedented,\u201d Metzger said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of an intimidating term, because it makes you feel we\u2019re unequipped to handle what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nMost of Day One was focused on the news cycle \u2014 a key tool for making sense of the present. Jasanoff invited everyone to pull out their laptops for some live polling on media habits and current events. Newspapers, social media, and word of mouth/group chats emerged as the go-to sources. Topping a ranking of 2024 issues were \u201cthe election,\u201d \u201cpolitical polarization,\u201d and \u201cPalestine.\u201d\n\nPicking up on one of these topics, Weld demonstrated how students might think about the war in Gaza using her module. In the Middle East and elsewhere, perspectives on the conflict are \u201cindelibly and inseparably framed,\u201d she said, by historical memories of two traumatic world events: the Holocaust, when 6 million Jews were killed by the Nazis, and the Nakba of 1948, when 750,000 Palestinian Arabs were displaced to create the modern State of Israel.\n\n\u201cHow one remembers those events \u2014 both within one\u2019s own families as well as politically speaking \u2014 makes up a constitutive building block of your interpretations of the present,\u201d Weld said.\n\nThe 75-minute session ended with Lepore lending rich historical insight to the 21st century\u2019s confusing swirl of fact, fiction, and information technology. She started with the \u201clong adversarial tradition\u201d between America\u2019s newspapers and its political leaders, beginning in the 1720s with the dogged New England Courant (published by Benjamin Franklin\u2019s brother James).\n\nThis year\u2019s candidates for U.S. president are hardly the first to try reaching voters without risking criticism by newspaper reporters. Lepore offered examples that bridge past and present including rallies, political postering, and President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s direct-to-listener radio broadcasts from the 1930s.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s cool to see that much of what we\u2019re dealing with has happened again and again,\u201d Metzger said. \u201cIt\u2019s such a grounded way to understand who we are and where we are in history.\u201d\n\nAt one point, Lepore shared an advertising clip from President Dwight D. Eisenhower\u2019s 1956 re-election campaign. It opens with an animated figure anguished over the firehose of political information from TV, radio, magazines, and newspapers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve listened to everybody,\u201d he cries. \u201cWho\u2019s right? What\u2019s right? What should I believe? What are the facts? How can I tell?\u201d\n\n\u201cThose are questions we still have,\u201d Lepore emphasized. \u201cThey\u2019re endemic to the age of mass communication we have been in for well more than a century. I hope that gives you some comfort.\u201d",

        "text": "Inflation, U.S. presidential election and cyberfraud top of mind for American investors\nDES MOINES, Iowa \u2013 American investors are keeping a close eye on the economy and the nation\u2019s capital according to a new survey from F&G Annuities & Life. F&G\u2019s fifth annual Risk Tolerance Tracker asked American investors how the events of the past 12 months have impacted their views on retirement and risk, as well as the issues they are concerned about for the year ahead.\n\nInflation continues to rank as the top stressor, with 80% of respondents saying they are worried about it having a negative impact on their financial future. This was followed closely by worries about the U.S presidential election, which were cited by nearly three quarters (72%) of American investors. More specifically, nearly half (48%) said they expect the presidential election to have an impact on their retirement plans.\n\nWorries about a recession are also top of mind at 72%. Additionally, cybercrime/fraud (63%), geopolitical risks/tensions (61%), historically high debt (59%), stock market volatility (59%) and the impact of Generative AI on finances (50%) are other leading concerns when people evaluate factors impacting their financial future.\n\nAmericans\u2019 risk tolerance over time\n\nWhen it comes to how American investors see overall risk tolerance and the mindset around their financial future, there are some signs of improvement, although many fears remain.\n\n73% of respondents say the events of the last 12 months made them less likely to take financial risks. This is down from the past two years when 78% of respondents said they had become more financially risk averse.\n\nWorries about retirement income still persist as 66% are worried about retirement income due to the events of the last 12 months, down only 3% from 2023.\n\nFewer people (53%) feel like their financial safety net was ripped away as a result of the past 12 months compared to 60% in 2023 and 67% in 2022.\n\nThe generational risk gap\n\nWhen it comes to how different generations view risk, Baby Boomers are the most worried about the U.S. presidential election having a negative impact on their financial future (79%), compared to Generation X (72%) and Millennials (64%).\n\nMeanwhile, GenX respondents are most worried about the U.S. entering a recession (76%), compared to Millennials (72%) and Baby Boomers (69%).\n\nAll generations continue to cite inflation as the top worry that may affect their financial future.\n\nDespite this, well over half (58%) of respondents stated that they don\u2019t currently use a financial professional. More concerning is that the two generations that are either in or approaching retirement may not be getting appropriate advice. Over half of Baby Boomers surveyed (53%) and nearly two-thirds of GenX (63%) don\u2019t use a financial professional.\n\nThe opportunity for guaranteed income products\n\nIn addition to overlooking advice, American investors are also overlooking guaranteed income products as a way to hedge these unpredictable times as only 14% of respondents noted owning an annuity.\n\nWhen asked about how important various factors were when considering their investments for retirement income, 88% noted guaranteed income for life as important just behind maximizing their accumulated income (91%).\n\n\u201cOur fifth annual survey shows that while risk tolerance is modestly increasing, uncertain economic factors continue to weigh on the minds of American investors,\u201d said Chris Blunt, CEO of F&G. \u201cYet at the same time, many investors are not taking advantage of the tools they need to plan for the long term, such as leveraging an advisor and building a balanced portfolio that includes guaranteed income products. Being proactive now can give investors more peace of mind in the months and years to come.\u201d\n\nFor more information on F&G\u2019s latest survey, please visit fglife.com/research\n\nSurvey Methodology\n\nThe survey was conducted online by ROI Rocket, a MarketOnce company and an industry leader in consumer and B2B research. It was fielded from August 22 to September 9, 2024 among a nationally representative sample of 1,678 U.S. adults 30 years of age and older who have sole or shared financial decision-making responsibility for their household, and own financial products valued at $10,000 or more.",

        "text": "American despair: In Arizona, high home prices and limited prospects shape voters\u2019 presidential pick\nMESA, Ariz. (AP) \u2014 Karl Peterson has been living the cruel inverse of the American dream. His rent keeps getting higher, but his apartments keep getting smaller.\n\nPeterson left the Midwest nine years ago for the epicenter of an economic boom, only to gradually learn that endless sunshine and desert views are increasingly among the few bargains left in Arizona. Peterson married his wife, Tani, and they struggled to save for a home, moving through four apartments as their rent nearly tripled from $625 to $1,800 a month.\n\nHe does not believe that either presidential nominee, Democrat Kamala Harris or Republican Donald Trump, is addressing the paradox of a country that has never been this wealthy even as so many people see themselves left behind. His trust in government is running low. The negatives of inflation and national division are easier to glimpse than are signs of hope.\n\nVoters like Peterson are at the fulcrum of the electorate in Arizona and the handful of other key states that will decide which candidate wins the White House and which party controls Congress.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re addressing what\u2019s really going on with me, with my family,\u201d said Peterson, who figures he will need to leave Mesa, east of Phoenix and the state\u2019s third-largest city, for Indiana or Wisconsin if he ever hopes to attain the middle-class promise of owning his own home.\n\nPromises by both parties to \u201chelp the middle class\u201d ring hollow to many voters who have heard those commitments before, only to see the pressures on housing, education, career, parenthood and the tending of their own aging parents mount.\n\nWhat to know about Trump\u2019s second term:\n\nStaffing the administration: Here are the people Trump has picked recess appointments Follow all of our coverage as Donald Trump assembles his second administration.\n\nHarris has pledged $25,000 for first-time homebuyers and tax breaks for new parents. The Trump campaign says mass deportations of migrants living in the U.S. without permanent legal permission will free up housing and that higher tariffs will create job opportunities. Voters are focused on the inflation of the past three years, but Federal Reserve data reveal a deeper gap in which the United States has so much wealth that it can be easy for anyone to feel worse off than their neighbors.\n\nDemocratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris walks to board Air Force Two, Friday, Oct. 11, 2024, at Sky Harbor International Airport in Phoenix, en route to Washington.

Yet there is a difference between meeting that average and being the typical household, despite gains since 2019. The median household had a net worth of just $192,900. That\u2019s the level at which half are above and half are below.\n\nPlenty of Americans can look at their personal finances and see reasons for comfort, even if they mostly register despair when asked about the health of the country as a whole. Nearly 6 in 10 described their own economic situation as good, even as 7 in 10 said the nation was on the wrong track, according to a September poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs.\n\nJohn Akers, 34, is one who feels lucky with how the economy has treated him, but worries too many of his family and friends are being left behind.\n\nHe and his wife have seen their fortunes improve over the past several years as their high-end audio-visual business has thrived, and the fixer-upper they bought in 2015 in Phoenix has proved to be a wise investment.\n\nAt the same time, some of their aging relatives have struggled with rising costs, and a few close friends are thinking about ditching Arizona to find cheaper housing. It\u2019s left him wondering if Washington is too focused on hot-button cultural issues.\n\n\u201cNo matter what, we\u2019re going to have polarization at the end of this election,\u201d said Akers, who plans to vote for Trump. \u201cThe political conversation is too often pitting the middle class against each other, and there\u2019s been too little focus on the issues that matter, like inflation and housing costs.\u201d\n\nRepublican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump gestures at a campaign rally at the Findlay Toyota Arena Sunday, Oct. 13, 2024, in Prescott Valley, Ariz.

But the land was cheap and once water and air conditioning arrived, the cities of Phoenix, Scottsdale, Chandler, Glendale, Tempe and Mesa spread across the once dry sandstone.\n\nTech companies like Intel, TSMC, Google and others arrived, as developers said the time it took to get approval for a new housing development in the county increased. Out of the biggest counties nationwide, Maricopa posted the largest percentage job gains so far this year, according to the Labor Department. Home prices have nearly doubled since 2016, according to Zillow.\n\nThe population surge \u2014 Phoenix is now the fifth largest U.S. city \u2014 also has fostered competing political beliefs in which the one source of unity is a mutual frustration with government leadership.\n\nA little more than half of Arizona voters said the government should do more to solve people\u2019s problems, according to AP VoteCast, a sweeping survey of the electorate, while less than half said the government was already doing too much. That year, about one-third of the state\u2019s voters identified as \u201cmoderates\u201d \u2014 a group whose votes could be critical to the outcome of the Nov. 5 election.\n\nVoters see reasons to doubt both candidates\u2019 commitment to help\n\nAbel Ramirez, 32, is an assistant pastor at the Baptist church where Karl Peterson worships. Ramirez voted for Trump in 2020, firmly opposes abortion, questions the credibility of the 2020 election that Democrat Joe Biden won, and believes Biden\u2019s administration is too supportive of LGBTQ+ rights.\n\nHis family lives in a manufactured home in a mobile home park and he figures that once all his kids are in school, his wife can work full time and he can take on a second job so they can buy a house. But he\u2019s dismayed by a politics geared toward hurting rivals instead of helping voters.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to helping the citizen, helping a guy that\u2019s got to go to work every day to provide for their family, I\u2019m not hearing too much about it,\u201d Ramirez said. He is considering not voting in this election.\n\nSamantha Lopez, who voted for Biden in 2020, believes the federal government needs to spend more on education, secure abortion rights and do more to expand Americans\u2019 access to health care.\n\nA student at Arizona State University, Lopez recently moved back to her parents\u2019 home about 15 miles from campus after it became clear to her that it would be too difficult to keep up with rent and groceries while paying for school.\n\n\u201cThe future feels really unpredictable right now,\u201d said Lopez, who is uncertain how she will vote, between serving customers earlier this year at her part-time job at a downtown Phoenix doughnut shop.\n\nIt\u2019s all about the housing market\n\nMaricopa County is a microcosm of the boom that has driven American prosperity over the past two presidencies, powering through the Great Recession\u2019s housing bust and pandemic era shutdowns. But that boom also destabilized people\u2019s confidence in the real estate market that helped drive the growth\n\nMore people moved into the area than its cities and neighborhoods could absorb, pushing prices up in ways that made mortgage rates of 6%-plus troubling. Homeowners felt they could not afford to sell and buy a new property. Renters felt that the promise of middle-class stability was increasingly out of reach.\n\n\u201cMany voters see home prices and 30-year mortgage rates and compare that to the experience of their parents and grandparents and say \u2018I\u2019m never going to own a home,\u2019\u201d said Glenn Farley, director of policy and research at the nonprofit Common Sense Institute Arizona. \u201cUntil those things are brought back under control, voters are going to continue to be sour.\u201d\n\nOther worries also overshadow progress. The country is more educated and more diverse, yet there are persistent worries about mass shootings, crime, personal liberties, illegal immigration, climate change and the capacity of the government to fix any of it.\n\nWhy do so many Americans feel bad about the economy? Blame our politics\n\nAmericans are finding firsthand that prosperity is not the same as opportunity.\n\nThe University of Michigan\u2019s consumer sentiment index, a well-regarded barometer of confidence in the economy, is lower now than during the height of the 2020 pandemic. The index, with Biden in power, shows that people also think about the economy based on their political identity. with Democrats comparatively optimistic and Republicans decidedly bleak.\n\nWhen Republican John Giles was elected mayor of Mesa in 2014, his goal was to have a place where his children and grandchildren could live.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to overlook the city in the shadow of Phoenix, but Mesa\u2019s population of 511,648 makes it larger than Atlanta, Miami or Minneapolis. The closing of Williams Air Force Base three decades ago led Mesa to recruit leading companies and Giles treats his state of the city addresses like a CEO at a tech rollout, recreating scenes from the time-travel movie \u201cBack to the Future\u201d and hanging out with shock rocker Alice Cooper.\n\nBut Giles made headlines by endorsing Harris and speaking at the Democratic National Convention in August, saying that her policies would be more helpful for his city than would Trump\u2019s. Giles sees the negativity swirling around the population as a byproduct of the politics in which ideologically driven media elevates conspiracy theories and consistently seeks to perpetuate division instead of rewarding problem-solving.\n\n\u201cI always used to think the political spectrum was a pendulum,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were these forces that would bring us back to seeing the flaws of extremism. But now there\u2019s a lot of people making a lot of money promoting extreme political thought. To be successful at that, you have to fan people\u2019s fears and tell them that they\u2019re unhappy.\u201d\n\nHe looks at the economic data \u2014 4.1% unemployment, new computer chips plants opening in Arizona, record levels of factory construction spending, a higher stock market and inflation easing \u2014 and confesses that he\u2019s never been one who could overlook the facts and toe the Republican Party line.\n\n\u201cPresident Biden should be hoisted on our shoulders and walked to the top of the mountain,\u201d he said.\n\nBuses get ready to depart with summer camp attendees at Valley Baptist Church, Tuesday, June 18, 2024, in Mesa, Ariz.

Doug Ducey, sees it, Arizona packed in generations of wealth creation in less than a decade. Its chief virtue was always its proximity to California and ability to capture both people and employers who found that state\u2019s taxes and cost of living to be too high.\n\nFarley said Arizona had a reliable climate and affordable electricity costs, adding 20,000 businesses in under eight years as posh steak houses opened in Paradise Valley, the small Phoenix suburb that is the state\u2019s richest city, and Waymo had driverless Jaguar sedans ferrying people through Scottsdale. But that growth also came with the need for a larger services sector with more people working for lower wages and inequality became clearer.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not the growth state anymore, but we\u2019re not the mature state,\u201d he said.\n\nThe pandemic also changed Arizona\u2019s economy.\n\nAfter the Great Recession, it was adding roughly 40,000 people a year on average from other states. But when the pandemic hit, the prospect of bigger homes brought in roughly 100,000 people in 2020, more than what the housing market could absorb. Median home prices in Maricopa County jumped to a peak of $500,767 in July 2022, leaving many renters unable to buy a home.\n\nTrevor Cowling, the assistant pastor at the Baptist church in Mesa, bought his 1,500 square foot home in 2020 for $225,000 with a 3.1% mortgage rate. Mortgage rates more than doubled, until easing recently, as have the prices in his neighborhood.\n\nTrevor Cowling helps out during an activity class at a summer camp for youth at Valley Baptist Church Tuesday, June 18, 2024, in Mesa, Ariz.

The redacted files are believed to include things like transcripts of grand jury testimony, which remain under wraps because of grand jury secrecy rules.\n\nOther information visible to the public includes passages from former Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s book, excerpts of testimony provided by several witnesses to the House committee that investigated the Jan. 6 riot and a transcript of Trump\u2019s phone call pressuring Georgia election officials to \u201cfind\u201d enough votes to reverse his election loss in the state to Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nOther documents include fundraising emails from Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign and Pence\u2019s letter telling Congress on Jan. 6 that he could not claim \u201cunilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not.\u201d\n\nThe filing was submitted as a series of appendices to a 165-page brief unsealed this month in which prosecutors disclosed new evidence against Trump to support their argument that the former president is not entitled to immunity from prosecution.\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyers objected to the unsealing of the filing so close to next month\u2019s presidential election, but Chutkan on Thursday rejected their bid to postpone the material from becoming public until after the election. She said it would be inappropriate to take the political calendar into account.\n\nRead the full, four-part collection of documents below:\n\nVolume 1\n\nVolume 2\n\nVolume 3\n\nVolume 4",

        "text": "US presidential election updates: Stars turn out for Harris while Trump tells story about Arnold Palmer\u2019s \u2018anatomy\u2019\nOn the first day of early voting in Detroit, Michigan, rapper Lizzo campaigned for Kamala Harris, saying she rejected the argument that America was not ready for a female president, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s about damn time\u201d. In Atlanta, Georgia, Harris was joined by singer Usher, with the Democratic candidate describing Donald Trump\u2019s speeches as \u201cnonsense\u201d.\n\nWith Harris and Trump essentially tied in the most competitive states, both campaigns are focused on early by mail or in person voting, with just 17 days until the 5 November election.\n\nIn the battleground of Pennsylvania, Trump escalated his personal attacks on Harris, calling her a \u201cshit vice-president\u201d. The Republican candidate had billed the event as the start of his final argument to voters but quickly went off script with a long story about Arnold Palmer that included remarks about the genitalia of the late golfing legend.\n\nHere\u2019s what else happened on Saturday:\n\nIn both Detroit and Atlanta, Harris urged her supporters to put in an all-out effort to win . \u201cOn election day, we don\u2019t want to have any regrets about what we could have done these next 17 days,\u201d she said. Harris hammered Trump for a second straight day for cancelling events and for avoiding another presidential debate because of what she called \u201cexhaustion\u201d. Her campaign called Trump\u2019s Pennsylvania rally \u201cjunk\u201d, saying he had focused on the issue \u201cmost important to voters in this election: a deceased golfer\u2019s \u2018anatomy\u2019.\u201d\n\nIn Atlanta, Harris said Trump was \u201ccruel\u201d for how he talked about the grieving family of a Georgia mother who died after complications from an abortion pill. Harris blamed Amber Thurman\u2019s death on Georgia\u2019s abortion restrictions and referenced a clip of Trump at a Fox News town hall. When asked about the Thurman family joining a separate media call, Trump reportedly said \u201cwe\u2019ll get better ratings, I promise.\u201d \u201cDonald Trump still refuses to take accountability, to take any accountability, for the pain and the suffering he has caused,\u201d Harris said.\n\nHarris repeated her call for a ceasefire in Israel\u2019s war in Gaza and said it was important to seize the opportunity provided by the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. Harris dodged a question on whether Arab American and Muslim anger over US support for Israel could cost her the election in the battleground state of Michigan, but said she would continue speaking out about the tragic loss of innocent lives. \u201cI speak publicly all the time about the fact that there are so many tragic stories coming from Gaza,\u201d Harris said.\n\nIn Latrobe, Pennsylvania, Trump said Harris is further to the left than Democratic Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders , adding \u201cYou have to tell Kamala Harris that you\u2019ve had enough, that you just can\u2019t take it any more.\u201d Trump underscored the importance of the eastern state\u2019s electoral college delegates to the overall election: \u201cIf we win Pennsylvania, we win the whole damn thing.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s campaign may be failing to reach thousands of voters they hope to turn out in Arizona and Nevada, with roughly a quarter of door-knocks done by America Pac flagged by its canvassing app as potentially fraudulent, according to leaked data and people familiar with the matter. The Trump campaign earlier this year outsourced the bulk of its ground game to America Pac, the political action committee founded by Elon Musk, betting that spending millions to turn out Trump supporters, especially those who don\u2019t typically vote, would boost returns.\n\nElsewhere on the campaign trail\n\nEarly voting also began on Saturday in Nevada, where Barack Obama campaigned for Harris in Las Vegas. The former president poked fun at Trump, telling the audience \u201cwe don\u2019t need to see what an older, loonier Donald trump with no guard rails looks like.\u201d\n\n1:56 Obama pokes fun at Trump's town hall concert \u2013 video\n\nBillionaire Mark Cuban \u2013 who has emerged as an energetic campaign surrogate for Harris \u2013 has told the Guardian that Trump\u2019s planned tariffs could put \u201csmall retailers and manufacturers out of business.\u201d \u201cSmall businesses don\u2019t have the pricing elasticity of larger companies. They can\u2019t pass on the incremental and administrative costs associated with tariffs.\u201d\n\nElsewhere another billionaire \u2013 Elon Musk \u2013 campaigned for Trump in Pennsylvania. Speaking in Harrisburg, he announced he would start to randomly distribute cash awards \u2013 $1m each day until the election \u2013 to a registered voter in the state who signed his organisation\u2019s petition. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO has taken an increasingly visible role in Trump\u2019s campaign and has donated almost $75m to his political organisation America PAC.\n\nRead more about the 2024 US election:",

        "text": "US election: Legal experts question Elon Musk\u2019s planned cash giveaways\nPlan to give $1m per day until November 5 election could violate law against using cash to induce voting, experts say.\n\nTech billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s promise to give away $1m per day until the United States election has drawn legal scrutiny, with experts warning the scheme could violate a prohibition on using cash to incentivise voting.\n\nPennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro said on Sunday that the plan to give money to registered voters in US swing states who also have signed an online petition was \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d and that law enforcement could \u201ctake a look\u201d at the effort.\n\nMusk gave a $1m cheque to an attendee of his America PAC event on Saturday in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, which aimed at rallying people behind Republican candidate and former US President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cMusk obviously has a right to be able to express his views. He\u2019s made it very, very clear that he supports Donald Trump. I don\u2019t. Obviously we have a difference of opinion,\u201d Shapiro said in an interview with NBC\u2019s Meet the Press programme.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t deny him that, right, but when you start flowing this kind of money into politics, I think it raises serious questions,\u201d he added.\n\nThrough America PAC, a political action committee that he founded in support of Trump, Musk has committed $75m to helping the former president defeat US Vice President and Democratic candidate Kamala Harris in the election on November 5.\n\n\u201cThis election, I think, is going to decide the fate of America and, along with the fate of America, the fate of Western civilisation,\u201d the Tesla co-founder said at a recent pro-Trump town hall event in Folsom, Pennsylvania.\n\nWhile such PACs are a common feature of US politics, legal experts have raised the alarm at Musk\u2019s pledge to give $1m cheques to people who sign a petition in favour of the First and Second Amendments of the US Constitution.\n\nThose amendments guarantee freedom of speech and the right to bear arms, respectively.\n\nThose who sign must be registered to vote, a potential violation of federal laws barring the use of cash or lottery-style chances to induce people to vote or register to vote.\n\nIt is a federal crime to pay people with the intention of inducing or rewarding them to cast a vote or to get registered \u2013 an offence punishable by prison time.\n\nThe prohibition covers not only monetary expenditures, but also anything of monetary value like liquor or lottery chances, a US Department of Justice election-crimes manual explains.\n\n\u201cThough maybe some of the other things Musk was doing were of murky legality, this one is clearly illegal,\u201d Rick Hasen, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, said in a blog post on Saturday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to hear if there\u2019s anyone who thinks this is not a clear case of a violation,\u201d he added.\n\nBrendan Fischer, a campaign finance lawyer, told The Associated Press that Musk\u2019s giveaway approaches a legal boundary. That\u2019s because the PAC is requiring registration as a prerequisite to become eligible for the $1m cheque.\n\n\u201cThere would be few doubts about the legality if every Pennsylvania-based petition signer were eligible, but conditioning the payments on registration arguably violates the law,\u201d Fischer told the news agency.\n\nMichael Kang, an election law professor at Northwestern University\u2019s Pritzker School of Law, also said the context of the giveaway so close to Election Day makes it harder to argue the effort is anything but an attempt to incentivise people to register to vote.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not quite the same as paying someone to vote, but you\u2019re getting close enough that we worry about its legality,\u201d Kang told AP.",

        "text": "Column: Hello, my name is Robin, and I have presidential election poll derangement syndrome\nAh, autumn: the season of pumpkin-spice everything, falling leaves and poll derangement syndrome.\n\nThese days, I wake up, log in and immediately look at the \u201cLatest Polls\u201d pages on Real Clear Politics and 538. My anxiety level on any given morning depends on the distance between the blue and red lines. Invariably, they are maddeningly close.\n\nI know obsessing about polls is dumb, but how else can we decide what to stock up on before election day: champagne or antidepressants?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou\u2019d think I would have learned my lesson eight years ago. Just before the 2016 election, my friend Suzanne was fretting that Donald Trump was going to beat Hillary Clinton. Suzanne is a sought-after hairstylist in Orange County, and she had been listening very closely to her clients, many of whom are politically conservative.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be silly,\u201d I told her as she blew my hair dry. \u201cThe polls all show Hillary winning decisively.\u201d\n\nI was so certain that I wrote in the memo section of the check I gave Suzanne, \u201cTrump can\u2019t win.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI don\u2019t make political predictions anymore.\n\nThe disparity between the 2016 polls and the election outcome was a \u201cjarring event\u201d for pollsters, as the American Assn. for Public Opinion Research put it in a postmortem. How could they have been so wrong?\n\nIt turns out that when the pollsters weighted their polls in an effort to correct discrepancies between their samples and the population, they failed to account for education levels. Their samples were skewed by the inclusion of too many college graduates, who tended to favor Clinton.\n\nIt was not entirely the pollsters\u2019 fault, though. Until that election, there had never been such a stark divide between white voters who were college-educated and those who weren\u2019t.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was a shock,\u201d said Scott Keeter, an expert on American public opinion and political behavior at the Pew Research Center in Washington. \u201cAt least from the time of the New Deal, the non-college group actually tended to be more Democratic.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, however, the appeal of populist politicians on the right and left has risen across the Western world, not just in the United States, undermining faith in government and institutions.\n\n\u201cWorking-class and less-educated voters,\u201d Keeter told me, \u201chave become more supportive of the populist candidates.\u201d Political scientists were aware of these trends, he said, \u201cbut Trump\u2019s candidacy really crystallized the phenomenon.\u201d Before 2016, education levels were simply not correlated with political views.\n\nCuriously, the pollsters didn\u2019t fare much better in the 2020 presidential election. Although they correctly predicted Biden\u2019s victory, they dramatically overestimated his support. That was partly a result of record turnout: About a quarter of 2020 voters had not voted in 2016. But pollsters were also wrong about which candidate those new voters would choose. Preelection polling indicated that the new voters would be younger and tend to vote Democratic, but they were about evenly split between Biden and Trump.\n\nThe Harvard Gazette recently spoke to Biden\u2019s chief 2020 pollster, John Anzalone, about why the polls have had such a mixed track record lately. For some reason, the polls have been less accurate when Trump was on the ballot.\n\n\u201cI think the challenges have a lot to do with modeling who\u2019s going to turn out,\u201d Anzalone said. \u201cThat has been an absolute mystery in the Trump era. I couldn\u2019t tell you who\u2019s going to turn out now.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYears ago, the writer Arianna Huffington and the comedian Harry Shearer launched the tongue-in-cheek initiative the Partnership for a Poll-Free America. Their manifesto urged people to \u201chang up on the pollsters who are polluting our political environment by dominating media coverage, influencing election outcomes, and turning our political leaders into slavish poll followers.\u201d It was a playful attempt to undermine the much-derided horse-race style of political journalism: Who\u2019s up today? Who\u2019s down?\n\nBut political coverage has evolved. Poll stories no longer dominate daily coverage.\n\nMany research and news organizations that sponsor polls, Keeter said, \u201chave stepped away from chasing the horse race and instead have focused more on trying to understand the dynamics, who the coalitions were and so forth. But the fact remains that people want to know who is ahead and who is behind.\u201d\n\nI know I do, and polls \u2014 however flawed \u2014 seem to be the only way to guess.\n\n\u201cIf you didn\u2019t have polls and were at the mercy of so-called man-on-the-street interviews or who is buying whose baseball caps, I think your anxiety levels would still be the same,\u201d Keeter said. \u201cThere\u2019s no cure for that.\u201d\n\nThreads: @rabcarian",

        "text": "'60 Minutes' comes to Door County for story about how it backs U.S. presidential election winners\nDOOR COUNTY - Win Door County, win the U.S. presidency. That's been the case since 2000, and \"60 Minutes\" wanted to know how and why.\n\nDoor County's record of voting purple across the last six elections for U.S. president made the Peninsula the subject of a feature report on Sunday's broadcast of the long-running CBS News show.\n\nThe 13-minute report, titled \"The Swingiest County,\" said that of the 513 counties in the seven closely contested \"swing states\" \u2013 Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada \u2013 whose combined 93 electoral votes likely will decide whether Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Donald Trump wins the Nov. 5 presidential election, Door County is the only one to have voted for the eventual winner in all six elections in the 21st century, no matter their political party: Republican George W. Bush in 2000 and 2004, Democrat Barack Obama in '08 and '12, Republican Trump in '16 and Democrat Joe Biden in 2020.\n\nThat's why CBS News correspondent Jon Wertheim traveled to the Peninsula to try and shed some light on why Door County has voted so purple \u2013 both red (for Republican Party candidates) and blue (for the Democrats) \u2013 since 2000, calling it \"the ultimate political weather vane.\"\n\n\"Consider Door a window into this critical election,\" Wertheim said in the introduction to his report.\n\nWertheim's report noted that while Biden carried Door County in 2020, he did so by just 292 votes, the closest margin of any Wisconsin county, while about 80% of the counties saw double-digit margins in the last two presidential races.\n\n\"Whoever wins in Door County is probably the next president of the United States,\" state Democratic Party Chair Ben Wikler said to Wertheim as part of the report.\n\nState Assembly Rep. Joel Kitchens, R-Sturgeon Bay, pointed out to \"60 Minutes\" the unique demographic mix of the 30,000 people living in Door County, from the farms of Southern Door to the manufacturing in Sturgeon Bay and the arts and tourism community in Northern Door, as one large reason the county isn't decisively red or blue.\n\n\"I think a lot of it is that we are such a cross-section of the state that we have a lot of people that came from the cities and from the suburbs and retired,\" Kitchens said to Wertheim. \"We have a strong agricultural community, we have heavy manufacturing, and as you can see when you drive along the lakeshore and the bayshore, there's a lotta money here. But there are also a lot of people that are really struggling as well.\"\n\n\"And it's not just the presidential elections,\" Kitchens added. \"It's virtually every statewide election, we seem to pick the winner. It's kind of weird.\"\n\nWertheim tried to find a Door County resident who, like the county, had voted for the eventual president in those last six elections. His quest took him to Al Johnson's Swedish Restaurant in Sister Bay, Door County Fire Co. in Sturgeon Bay and a Rotary Club of Sturgeon Bay meeting, but the closest he came was with a man at Door County Fire Co. who said he'd backed five of the six, voting for Trump instead of Biden in 2020.\n\nBut Wertheim reported that while the Peninsula's residents may be closely split on who they support, they seem to do so without the rancor and divisiveness seen elsewhere in the country during this election cycle.\n\n\"We found a place in America where family and community outrank party loyalty,\" Wertheim said in his report. \"In this divisive election season, we came to America's ultimate battleground, except there was no battle. As they say here with pride, 'We live above the tension line.'\"\n\nWertheim spoke with Austin Vandertie, a sixth-generation dairy farmer in Brussels who said he's supporting Trump, citing inflation as his main concern. Vandertie said he knows he has relatives who \"absolutely\" will vote for another candidate, but all of then still can get together for Thanksgiving dinner without fighting.\n\n\"Politics is, you know, if we can't talk about it that means it's gone way too far in the wrong direction,\" Vandertie said.\n\n\"You recognize that's not necessarily the vibe in the country at large?\" Wertheim asked him.\n\n\"Hey, we're a little different in Wisconsin, I guess,\" Vandertie replied. \"We got that 'Midwest nice' going on.\"\n\n\"You don't wanna alienate your neighbors, you don't wanna alienate your fellow business owners,\" Emma Cox, owner of kindgoods, a fair-trade gift and decor boutique in Sister Bay, and a supporter of reproductive rights, told Wertheim. \"You all come together.\"\n\nSocial media reaction\n\nA number of people and local organizations that posted on their Facebook pages about the piece complimented it and said they were happy Door County was featured in a positive light.\n\n\"It was pretty cool being part of 60 Minutes,\" Kitchens posted on his Facebook page. \"They spent many days in Door County putting this together. I think it was fair and cast our county in a good light.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s a 50/50 political county, but the difference is that the residents don\u2019t hate each other,\" former state Secretary of Tourism Stephanie Klett posted on her page. \"Bravo to the Door, and to the producers at 60 Minutes who showed the best in people & politics.\"\n\nHowever, local resident Paul Taylor was one of several who used the opportunity in his post to warn people how important is their vote in this election.\n\n\"A fascinating if not somewhat horrifying story,\" he posted. \"I know a lot of people here - especially young people, are checked out, disenfranchised, rightfully pissed off about Gaza and many just don\u2019t even care \u2026 All I\u2019m saying (for today) is - def make time to watch the story if you can and by god please please please VOTE.

In recent elections, Democrats have had an edge in the popular vote even when they have lost the Electoral College and thus the White House. They have been looking to Ms. Harris to build a strong national lead as a sign that she would do well in such critical swing states as Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\n[Nate Cohn evaluates whether Donald Trump could win the popular vote but lose the Electoral College.]\n\nMs. Harris and Mr. Trump remain effectively tied even after three of the most tumultuous months in recent American political history. A high-profile debate, two attempts on Mr. Trump\u2019s life, dozens of rallies across seven battlefield states and hundreds of millions spent on advertisements have seemingly done little to change the trajectory of the race.",

Election officials and other voting experts are raising concerns that these legal challenges may discourage eligible voters .",
        "text": "What to know about Republican challenges to overseas and military voting\nWhat to know about Republican challenges to overseas and military voting\n\ntoggle caption Allison Joyce/Getty Images\n\nIn the final weeks before Election Day, Republican groups have filed lawsuits in the swing states of Michigan, North Carolina and Pennsylvania that challenge the validity of ballots cast by U.S. citizens living abroad, including members of the U.S. military.\n\nPassed in 1986, a federal law known as the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act has required states to allow military members and their family members, plus other so-called UOCAVA voters, to cast absentee ballots in federal elections.\n\nMore than 938,000 UOCAVA voters had ballots counted in the 2020 general election. And for this fall\u2019s election, Pennsylvania has sent more than 25,000 ballots to overseas voters, according to the Pennsylvania Department of State.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe election rules states put in place for overseas voting have remained uncontroversial for decades \u2014 until now.\n\nWith absentee voting underway, election officials and other voting experts are raising concerns that these legal challenges may discourage eligible voters from casting ballots and sow the grounds for questioning the upcoming results.\n\n\n\nWhat Republicans are arguing in court about overseas voters\n\nIn Pennsylvania, a group of six Republican members of the U.S. House of Representatives \u2014 all of whom voted against certifying the swing state\u2019s presidential electoral votes in 2020 \u2014 first filed a federal lawsuit in September.\n\nThey argue that Pennsylvania\u2019s election rules \u2014 which do not require eligible overseas voters to show identification when registering or, if voting for the first time in a federal election in the state, turn in a copy of their ID with their absentee ballot \u2014 skirt identity verification requirements for voters registered by mail under a federal law known as the Help America Vote Act.\n\nThat law, however, specifically exempts overseas voters from having to provide a document proving their identity. When registering to vote in federal elections, overseas voters have to either provide their driver\u2019s license number or the last four digits of their Social Security number, or report that they have neither so that a state can assign them a unique ID number. But federal law defers to states to determine whether the information provided is \u201csufficient\u201d according to their state laws.\n\nIn the two other lawsuits, filed this month, the Republican National Committee is questioning the eligibility of specific categories of overseas voters, who, the RNC argues, do not meet requirements under Michigan and North Carolina\u2019s state constitutions for voters to be residents.\n\nTo comply with UOCAVA\u2019s requirements, North Carolina\u2019s election rules allow absentee voting by citizens who were born outside the U.S. and whose parent or legal guardian\u2019s former residence is in the state. Michigan\u2019s secretary of state has issued similar guidance: \u201cA United States citizen who has never resided in the United States but who has a parent, legal guardian, or spouse who was last domiciled in Michigan is eligible to vote in Michigan as long as the citizen has not registered or voted in another state.\u201d\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cNorth Carolinians and Michiganders should not have their votes canceled by those who\u2019ve never lived in the state in the first place \u2013 plain and simple,\u201d Michael Whatley, the RNC\u2019s chair, said in a statement.\n\nBut the state election offices named in these lawsuits point out that these rules have been in place for years to help minimize barriers that can keep U.S. citizens from exercising their right to vote.\n\n\u201cThe plaintiffs have challenged a state law that allows US citizens living abroad to vote in North Carolina elections when these voters\u2019 only residential connection to a US state is through their parents\u2019 former residence in North Carolina. Otherwise, these US citizens have no other way to vote in US elections,\u201d Patrick Gannon, a spokesperson for the North Carolina State Board of Elections, said in a statement.\n\nAngela Benander, a spokesperson for the Michigan Department of State, noted that among the citizens whose voting rights the RNC is \u201ctargeting\u201d are the \u201cchildren of active-duty military service members who are making sacrifices for our freedoms.\u201d\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, however, has been focusing his criticism on overseas voters who are not connected with the military. In a September post on his social media platform, the Republican presidential nominee appeared to reference the Democratic National Committee\u2019s new voter-registration push among U.S. citizens living abroad, saying without evidence that Democrats \u201cwant to dilute the TRUE vote of our beautiful military and their families.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhy the timing of these lawsuits is raising concerns\n\nMany legal experts do not expect these cases to go anywhere. Apart from any legal arguments, they point to procedural problems \u2014 including the timing of these lawsuits.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s kind of boggling about these lawsuits is that none of the systems that they are challenging about these voters are new,\u201d says Danielle Lang, senior director of the Campaign Legal Center\u2019s voting rights program. \u201cThe RNC is not unfamiliar with election laws. These aren\u2019t new to them, and yet they\u2019re raising these questions at the very last minute before an election. It seems like they\u2019re trying to raise questions rather than answer them.\u201d\n\nSponsor Message\n\nDuring a hearing last week in the Michigan lawsuit, Judge Sima Patel of the state's Court of Claims said the RNC\u2019s \u201cbiggest hurdle\u201d is bringing this case weeks after election officials started sending out ballots to UOCAVA voters.\n\nAttorneys are now waiting for rulings from the Michigan judge and the Pennsylvania case\u2019s federal judge, who also held a hearing last week. A hearing in the North Carolina lawsuit is scheduled for Monday.\n\nWith about two weeks left before the end of voting, many election watchers are concerned that these legal challenges are laying groundwork for questioning the ballots of eligible voters.\n\n\u201cWe are right now in a cycle of spectacularly invented controversy, where the problems aren\u2019t real problems but fuel an outrage machine,\u201d says Justin Levitt, a constitutional law professor at Loyola Law School, who has served as a Justice Department official and in the Biden administration as a White House voting rights policy adviser.\n\nIn a statement, Matt Heckel, a spokesperson for the Pennsylvania Department of State, compared the GOP lawmakers\u2019 case to efforts during the previous presidential election.\n\n\u201cThis challenge appears to be a continuation of the unfounded litigation in state and federal court filed in 2020 in an effort to sow confusion and ultimately to throw out the votes of millions of Pennsylvanians and overturn the results of that legitimate election,\u201d Heckel said. \u201cThose efforts failed then, and these latest dishonest efforts will also fail.\u201d\n\n\n\nHow these lawsuits could affect overseas voting\n\nEven if these lawsuits are ultimately tossed out of the courts, Lang of the Campaign Legal Center is concerned about the costs of this controversy on eligible voters living abroad.\n\n\u201cI can promise you that military and overseas voters reading these newspaper articles are very anxious about their vote,\u201d Lang says. \u201cThey may feel confused. They may feel like their vote isn\u2019t going to count. And so what\u2019s the point? And I certainly hope that\u2019s not the case, but I fear that it may be.\u201d\n\nSponsor Message\n\nWhile the main federal law about overseas voting is usually associated with the military, a survey by the U.S. Election Assistance Commission shows that uniformed service members made up about 42% of registered UOCAVA voters in 2020.\n\n\u201cUndercutting confidence in our free and fair elections by disenfranchising our service men and women is unacceptable,\u201d Democratic Rep. Pat Ryan of New York, who served two tours in Iraq as a battalion intelligence officer in the U.S. Army, wrote in a letter last week to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who is charged with carrying out UOCAVA.\n\nIn a statement, Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Gen. Patrick Ryder said Austin \u201cbelieves that service members serving overseas, eligible family members and U.S. citizens overseas have the right to vote, and DOD will continue to work to help them do so.\u201d\n\nIn court filings for all three lawsuits, the Republican groups have asked the courts to at least order election officials to set aside the returned ballots of UOCAVA voters and not count them in the final election results until the voters\u2019 eligibility can be confirmed.\n\nBut election officials warn that would introduce a new process that could bring confusion and disrupt an already-tense period for election workers, who are under public pressure to report accurate vote tallies as soon as possible.\n\nKathy Boockvar, who used to oversee elections in Pennsylvania as secretary of the commonwealth, notes that the swing state\u2019s election rules allow UOCAVA voters\u2019 ballots to be received up to seven days after Election Day.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a sort of ripe time for the intentional insertion of distrust and conspiracy theories and tearing down faith in our electoral process,\u201d Boockvar said last week during a press briefing organized by Issue One, a democracy-focused advocacy group. \u201cThere's so many protections in place. This is such a critical right for our American citizens overseas and in the military. Adding this doubt and intentional fueling of distrust is just another example of exactly what we don't need.\u201d\n\nSponsor Message\n\nTom Bowman contributed reporting. Edited by Benjamin Swasey",

        "text": "Trump works the fry station and holds a drive-thru news conference at a Pennsylvania McDonald\u2019s\nFEASTERVILLE-TREVOSE, Pa. (AP) \u2014 Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump manned the fry station at a McDonald\u2019s in Pennsylvania on Sunday before staging an impromptu news conference, answering questions through the drive-thru window.\n\nAs reporters and aides watched, an employee showed Trump how to dunk baskets of fries in oil, salt the fries and put them into boxes using a scoop. Trump, a well-known fan of fast food and a notorious germophobe, expressed amazement that he didn\u2019t have to touch the fries with his hands.\n\n\u201cIt requires great expertise, actually, to do it right and to do it fast,\u201d Trump said with a grin, putting away his suit jacket and wearing an apron over his shirt and tie.\n\nThe visit came as he\u2019s tried to counter Democratic nominee Kamala Harris\u2019 accounts on the campaign of working at the fast-food chain while in college, an experience that Trump has claimed \u2014 without offering evidence \u2014 never happened.\n\nA large crowd lined the street outside the restaurant in Feasterville-Trevose, which is part of Bucks County, a key swing voter area north of Philadelphia. The restaurant itself was closed to the public for Trump\u2019s visit. The former president later attended an evening town hall in Lancaster and the Pittsburgh Steelers home game against the New York Jets.\n\nAfter serving bags of takeout to people in the drive-thru lane, Trump leaned out of the window, still wearing the apron, to take questions from the media staged outside. The former president, who has constantly promoted falsehoods about his 2020 election loss, said he would respect the results of next month\u2019s vote \u201cif it\u2019s a fair election.\u201d\n\nWhat to know about Trump\u2019s second term:\n\nStaffing the administration: Here are the people Trump has picked recess appointments Follow all of our coverage as Donald Trump assembles his second administration.\n\nHe joked about getting one reporter ice cream and when another asked what message he had for Harris on her 60th birthday on Sunday, Trump said, \u201cI would say, \u2018Happy Birthday, Kamala,\u2019\u201d adding, \u201cI think I\u2019ll get her some flowers.\u201d\n\nTrump did not directly answer a question of whether he might support increased minimum wages after seeing McDonald\u2019s employees in action but said, \u201cThese people work hard. They\u2019re great.\u201d\n\nHe added that \u201cI just saw something \u2026 a process that\u2019s beautiful.\u201d\n\nWhen aides finally urged him to wrap things up so he could hit the road to his next event, Trump offered, \u201cWasn\u2019t that a strange place to do a news conference?\u201d\n\nTrump has long questioned Harris\u2019 story of working at McDonald\u2019s\n\nTrump has fixated in recent weeks on the summer job Harris said she held in college, working the cash register and making fries at McDonald\u2019s while in college. Trump says the vice president has \u201clied about working\u201d there, but not offered evidence for claiming that.\n\nRepresentatives for McDonald\u2019s did not respond to a message about whether the company had employment records for one of its restaurants 40 years ago. But Harris spokesman Joseph Costello said the former president\u2019s McDonald\u2019s visit \u201cshowed exactly what we would see in a second Trump term: exploiting working people for his own personal gain.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump doesn\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like to work for a living, no matter how many staged photo ops he does, and his entire second term plan is to give himself, his wealthy buddies, and giant corporations another massive tax cut,\u201d Costello said in a statement.\n\nIn an interview last month on MSNBC, the vice president pushed back on Trump\u2019s claims, saying she did work at the fast-food chain four decades ago when she was in college.\n\n\u201cPart of the reason I even talk about having worked at McDonald\u2019s is because there are people who work at McDonald\u2019s in our country who are trying to raise a family,\u201d she said. \u201cI worked there as a student.\u201d\n\nHarris also said: \u201cI think part of the difference between me and my opponent includes our perspective on the needs of the American people and what our responsibility, then, is to meet those needs.\u201d\n\nTrump has long spread groundless claims about his opponents based on their personal history, particularly women and racial minorities.\n\nBefore he ran for president, Trump was a leading voice of the \u201cbirther\u201d conspiracy that baselessly claimed President Barack Obama was from Africa, was not an American citizen and therefore was ineligible to be president. Trump used it to raise his own political profile, demanding to see Obama\u2019s birth certificate and five years after Obama did so, Trump finally admitted that Obama was born in the United States.\n\nDuring his first run for president, Trump repeated a tabloid\u2019s claims that Texas Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s father, who was born in Cuba, had links to President John F. Kennedy\u2019s assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald. Cruz and Trump competed for the party\u2019s 2016 nomination.\n\nIn January of this year, when Trump was facing Nikki Haley, his former U.N. ambassador, in the Republican primary, he shared on his social media network a post with false claims that Haley\u2019s parents were not citizens when she was born, therefore making her ineligible to be president.\n\nHaley is the South Carolina-born daughter of Indian immigrants, making her automatically a native-born citizen and meeting the constitutional requirement to run for president.\n\nAnd Trump has continued to promote baseless claims during this campaign. Trump said during his presidential debate with Harris that immigrants who had settled in Springfield, Ohio, were eating residents\u2019 pets \u2014 a claim he suggested in an interview Saturday was still true even though he could provide no confirmation.\n\nTrump\u2019s visit created a spectacle in Pennsylvania\n\n\u201cIt is a fundamental value of my organization that we proudly open our doors to everyone who visits the Feasterville community,\u201d the McDonald\u2019s location\u2019s owner, Derek Giacomantonio, said in a statement. \u201cThat\u2019s why I accepted former President Trump\u2019s request to observe the transformative working experience that 1 in 8 Americans have had: a job at McDonald\u2019s.\u201d\n\nPolice closed the busy streets around the McDonald\u2019s during Trump\u2019s visit. Authorities cordoned off the restaurant as a crowd a couple blocks long gathered, sometimes 10- to 15-deep, across the street straining to catch a glimpse of Trump. Horns honked and music blared as Trump supporters waved flags, held signs and took pictures.\n\nJohn Waters, of nearby Fairless Hills, had never been to a Trump rally and had hoped to see the former president so close to his house after missing other nearby rallies.\n\n\u201cWhen I drove up, all the cars, unbelievable, I was like, \u2018He\u2019s here\u2019s, he\u2019s coming, he\u2019s definitely coming with this all traffic,\u2019\u201d Waters said.\n\nTrump is especially partial to McDonald\u2019s Big Macs and Filet-o-Fish sandwiches. He\u2019s talked often about how he trusts big chains more than smaller restaurants since they have big reputations to maintain, and the former president\u2019s staff often pick up McDonald\u2019s and serve it on his plane.\n\nJim Worthington, a Trump supporter and fundraiser who owns a nearby athletic complex and chaired Pennsylvania\u2019s delegation to the Republican National Convention, said he arranged Trump\u2019s visit to the locally owned McDonald\u2019s franchise.\n\nThe campaign contacted him looking for a McDonald\u2019s in Pennsylvania and Worthington started looking for one. He got in touch with Giacomantonio through a friend and talked the franchise owner through some initial nervousness.\n\nGiacomantonio needed to know that McDonald\u2019s corporate offices would be OK with it, first. Second, he was concerned that being seen as a Trump supporter would hurt his business or a spark boycott, Worthington said.\n\n\u201cHe certainly had concerns, but I eased his mind, and talked to him about the benefits,\u201d Worthington said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Will Weissert in Washington contributed to this report.",

        "text": "US presidential election: With just two weeks to go, why is the race still so close?\nWASHINGTON - Confronted by a dead heat in opinion polls that show a frozen presidential race two weeks before election day, both camps are fighting for every vote.\n\nSurveys show razor-thin gaps between Vice-President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump in the handful of decisive swing states, as well as nationally. All the polls are within the margin of error.\n\nWhy is this race even close? It is a question that frustrates both Democrats and Republicans, expecting their candidate to have a clear advantage.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a good answer,\u201d Virginia Senator Mark Warner, a Democratic heavyweight, told The Straits Times. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a candidate like Mr Trump, who is so negative about America, so inward-looking that he will ruin our connections in Asia. And it feels like every day he is slightly more erratic,\u201d said Mr Warner, in a short interview on the sidelines of an Oct 19 event to shore up support for Ms Harris in Virginia.\n\nIn July, Mr Warner, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, was at the forefront of efforts to mobilise Democratic senators to pressure US President Joe Biden to step down as the party\u2019s presidential candidate, after his faltering performance in a debate with Trump. It led to the emergence of Ms Harris.\n\nMr Warner cast doubt on the polls. \u201cI think she\u2019s still going to win if the final days go well,\u201d he said. \u201cI know people are concerned about inflation, but it\u2019s coming down. And at the end of the day, I think people are going to turn up for Kamala. I\u2019m not sure the polls reflect that.\u201d\n\nNo independent analyst is brave enough to stick his neck out to predict the outcome. Flashy pollster Nate Silver said this week that Trump had a slight edge, with a 50.2 per cent chance of winning, compared with Ms Harris\u2019 49.5 per cent.",

        "text": "U.S. Presidential Election 2024: A Defining Moment for International Diplomacy and Global Stability\nThe upcoming U.S. presidential election presents a pivotal moment for international diplomacy and global stability. As the world grapples with multifaceted challenges\u2014ranging from geopolitical tensions to climate change\u2014the implications of this election extend far beyond American borders. The choices made by American voters will resonate globally, influencing diplomatic relations, international governance, and the very fabric of global stability.\n\nThe Context of the 2024 Election\n\nGenerally, foreign policy has not been a concern of major interest in American presidential campaigns. However, the consequences of these elections do impact both friends and foes of the United States in a sort of way. Currently, we are witnessing China\u2019s increasing and more aggressive actions, European and Middle Eastern never-ending conflicts, and nationalism that directly opposes the contemporary globalization. This is why the 2024 election is so important because it pits two very different ideas about America\u2019s place in the world.\n\nCandidates\u2019 Foreign Policy Agendas\n\nThe two favorites in the 2024 contest, Kamala Harris, the Vice President of the United States, and the former President of the United States, Donald Trump, have distinctly contrasting visions for foreign policy. Harris supports a collective action through international cooperation, cooperation with NATO, fight against current challenges such as climate change or violations of human rights. In contrast, the principles of President Trump\u2019s foreign policy agenda, known as, the \u201cAmerica First\u201d policy, aims at the United States\u2019 self-interests together with a decrease in entanglements globally. This juxtaposition reveals a broader battle for the souls of America as a political tradition regarding the United States\u2019 international place.\n\nHarris\u2019s Vision:\n\nMultilateralism: Strong support for NATO and international cooperation.\n\nGlobal Challenges: Focus on climate change and human rights.\n\nCommitment to Allies: Continued support for Ukraine against Russian aggression.\n\nTrump\u2019s Vision:\n\nIsolationism: A retreat from multilateral agreements.\n\nNational Interests: Prioritization of American economic and security interests.\n\nSkepticism of Alliances: Questioning the value of longstanding partnerships.\n\nGlobal Reactions and Expectations\n\nInternationally, there is a palpable sense of uncertainty regarding the future of U.S. foreign policy. Countries across Europe, Asia, and the Global South are preparing for potential shifts in diplomatic relations depending on who occupies the White House after January 2025. Experts suggest that while some nations anticipate continuity in U.S. policies regardless of the election outcome, others are bracing for significant changes that could alter their strategic calculations.\n\nImplications for Global Governance\n\nThe election takes place at a time when the international order framed by rules is under more pressure than ever before. Because of the continuous fighting between Ukraine and Russia or the Gaza-Israel conflict as well as china\u2019s encroachment, leaders of the world are wondering whether they should continue to rely on America\u2019s guidance. It will take a great deal of diplomatic finesse for the next administration to consider these while both candidates feel compelled to reposition America in a world that is becoming increasingly multi polar.\n\nKey Considerations:\n\nChina\u2019s Assertiveness: Both candidates will need to address China\u2019s strategic competition.\n\nMiddle Eastern Conflicts: The U.S. approach to Israel-Palestine relations will be scrutinized.\n\nGlobal South Relations: There is an opportunity to rectify past neglect of Global South countries.\n\nThe Future of Multilateralism\n\nMultilateralism is gradually becoming a topic of discussion, and as such, it is going to be up to the next president of the United States to determine the framing of this particular system. Whereas Harris might call for fresh and strengthened dedication to those global organizations, the Trump approach may result in continuing disintegration of the presently emergent governance structures. This election therefore is not only an election of candidates, but more so an election of America\u2019s place in the world.\n\nRegardless of who wins the presidency, it is critical for the United States to:\n\nReaffirm Commitment to Allies: Strengthening alliances will be essential in countering authoritarian influences.\n\nEngage with Global South: Acknowledging the autonomy and perspectives of Global South nations can foster more equitable international relations.\n\nPromote Inclusive Multilateralism: Reforming international institutions to better reflect contemporary realities can enhance global cooperation.\n\nFinally, the 2024 U.S. presidential election stands as a defining moment for international diplomacy and global stability. As voters prepare to make their choice, they must consider not only domestic issues but also how their decision will reverberate across borders. The next administration will inherit a complex geopolitical landscape that will be very tight and challenging in engaging with partners, allies and adversaries. In this context, America\u2019s leadership\u2014or lack thereof\u2014will significantly shape the future trajectory of global stability in an era marked by uncertainty and change.",

        "text": "In the U.S. presidential election, religious groups are more divided than we think\nOutsiders may find it disconcerting to hear the religious references, whether sincere or opportunistic, that have been working their way into U.S. political discourse since the Reagan years, including some by certain religious leaders.\n\nDespite this, the role of religious identities in American elections cannot be decoded by simply pitting the faithful against secularized progressives. Even quite far on the left, it\u2019s not rare to hear male and female politicians referring to their faith.\n\nAlthough the leaders of the Christian right are united in their goal of gaining privileged access to the Oval Office, the different religious populations in the U.S. are politically quite divided.\n\nTrained as a geographer, historian and religiologist, I have been studying the evolution of ethnoreligious diversity in Qu\u00e9bec as a whole, as well as in certain specific religious universes, for twenty years. My analyses are based on both Canadian census data and field surveys. Since 2016, I have examined different elections at various levels of government (Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada, United States), particularly from the angle of geography and culture.\n\nEthnic realities\n\nThe meaning of the partisan leanings of faith-based groups will escape us unless we take into account how the ethnic or racial groups that form these groups express strong socio-political differences due to their historical experiences, sociology and sensibilities.\n\nThrough surveys, specialized research institutions such as the Pew Research Center and the Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI) have been able to identify and highlight ethnoconfessional subsets.\n\nThree main Protestant blocs\n\nAccording to the PRRI census, in 2022, 41 per cent of the U.S. population associated itself with one of the many churches that make up the Protestant world. These churches can be opposed in terms of theology and certain social positions.\n\nMainline churches are more liberal and sensitive to social justice causes. Evangelical churches have a reputation for being conservative to different degrees. That said, there are some liberal evangelical churches.\n\nBy combining the liberal/conservative dynamic with the ethnic dimension, we can distinguish, under umbrella names, three major ethnoconfessional blocs.\n\n(The Associated Press, Rebecca Blackwell)\n\nThe first two blocs are made up of the Euro-descendant fringe of the mainline and evangelical churches. Each bloc represents a third of the American Protestant universe, or 14 per cent of the total population.\n\nThe third bloc is made up of the third of Protestants who come from other origins (Afro-descendant, Latino, etc.). More than half of these are African Americans, representing eight per cent of the country\u2019s population. Two out of three Protestant African Americans are members of congregations associated with \u201cBlack churches\u201d of various denominations. Evangelical Latinos are often overlooked in analyses.\n\nAccording to a Pew study published in 2014, congregants of Black churches are closer to white evangelicals in their theological beliefs, but closer to the liberal positions of mainline white congregants on social issues such as abortion. In contrast to white evangelicals and mainline Protestants, Black Protestants look positively on government intervention to help the poor.\n\n(The Associated Press, George Walker IV)\n\nGenerally speaking, the Republican Party wins, hands down, among white evangelicals. The mainline white vote is more divided between the two major parties, although the majority leans Republican.\n\nBlack Protestants, for their part, have leaned overwhelmingly towards the Democratic Party, especially since the heyday of the civil rights movement.\n\nWith their conservative values, particularly on the abortion issue, Latinos are closer to Republican Euro-descendant evangelicals.\n\n(The Associated Press, Alex Brandon)\n\nCatholics: United but diverse\n\nCatholics, meanwhile, make up 23 per cent of the U.S. population according to the 2022 PRRI census. While their universe is united in terms of religious denomination, it is ethnoculturally highly diverse.\n\nMore than half (55 per cent) are of European origin (Irish, French, Italian, Polish, etc.). Four out of 10 (37 per cent) are of \u201cLatino\u201d or \u201cHispanic\u201d origin (Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Salvadorian, etc.). These two groups represent 13 per cent and nine per cent of the U.S. population, respectively.\n\nAlthough this dynamic plays out inside a single church, there is still polarization between conservatives and liberals within it.\n\nFor the past 25 years, Euro-descendants have favoured the Republican Party. The propensity of Latino Catholics to vote Democrat is significant, although allegiances are now diversifying. Anti-socialists of Cuban and Venezuelan origin are inclined to vote Republican.\n\nThe other communities\n\nThe Christian panorama also includes three per cent of members of other churches, including Mormons, Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses and Orthodox Christians. While Mormons largely favour the Republican Party, this margin of support is eroding.\n\nNon-Christian Americans (Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus, etc.) make up six per cent of the population. As different as they may be, members of these religious universes mostly support Democrats.\n\nChanging the political landscape\n\nIn spite of what the context seems to suggest, the trend of secularization in western societies is affecting the United States, as well. The different Protestant churches and the Catholic Church have been losing members for decades now, despite the contribution of Christian immigration.\n\nAccording to PRRI, between 2006 and 2022, the share of white mainline Protestants in the U.S. population fell from 18 per cent to 14 per cent. The proportion of white Catholics slipped from 16 per cent to 13 per cent. A little known fact: white evangelicals, who used to dominate the religious landscape of the U.S. with a share of 23 per cent, are now down to 14 per cent.\n\nConversely, the proportion of people with no religious affiliation has climbed from 16 per cent to 27 per cent. The latter are either affiliated with \u201cno religion in particular,\u201d or are atheist or agnostic. This segment is more naturally inclined towards supporting the Democratic Party, in a ratio that ranges from two-thirds to three-quarters.\n\nFluctuating partisan leanings from Bush to Biden\n\nAccording to Pew exit polls, between the presidential elections of 2000 and 2012, Protestant support for Republican candidates fluctuated little. It reached 59 per cent in 2004, a year when international political issues helped George W. Bush to be elected. It dipped to 54 per cent in 2008, when Barack Obama was elected for the first time.\n\nSince 2004, three-quarters of white evangelicals have supported Republican candidates. The Republican preference of white mainline Protestants remains very stable at around 53-55 per cent. Black Protestants\u2019 support for Democratic candidates, although massive, can also fluctuate. It dipped to 86 per cent in 2004 and rose to 95 per cent in 2012, during Obama\u2019s second election. Black voter turnout then exceeded that of whites.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2012, the majority of Catholics preferred Democratic candidates, except in 2004 (47 per cent). However, the majority of white Catholics preferred Republican candidates, with rates rising from 52 per cent to 59 per cent. Latino Catholics lined up clearly behind Democrats by a margin of two to one, peaking at 75 per cent in 2012.\n\n(The Associated Press, Rebecca Blackwell)\n\nIn 2016, the leaders of the Christian Right found, in Donald Trump, the right candidate to accomplish their goal of restoring the role of the Christian religion to governance and society more broadly, with the immediate aim of opposing abortion rights. The religious right is a coalition that brings together mainly evangelicals, but also other Protestants and fundamentalist Catholics.\n\nWhile Hillary Clinton won the popular vote, the small number of her white evangelical supporters slipped further in favour of the Republican Party. Trump won not only the majority of Protestants (56 per cent), but also of Catholics (52 per cent).\n\nIn 2020, 59 per cent of Protestants supported Trump thanks to the mobilization of white evangelicals, of whom 84 per cent voted for him. Compared with 2016, the white mainline Protestant vote was unchanged (57 per cent). Joe Biden, a practising Catholic, managed to save the day by rallying 49 per cent of Catholics, just short of the 50 per cent who were pro-Trump. Biden also retained 40 per cent of Protestants, of whom African Americans are a significant proportion.\n\nIt was actually the religiously unaffiliated voters who changed the game, with 71 per cent voting for Biden. That\u2019s six points more than for Clinton. The Democratic victory was made up of more diversified support.\n\nWhat\u2019s changing\n\nReligious issues are not usually at the forefront of presidential campaigns. The cost of living, health care, access to affordable housing and safety are currently the most frequently raised concerns.\n\nHowever, the Supreme Court\u2019s overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022 turned abortion rights into an election issue. While Trump has won the loyalty of the religious right, the Republican Party has been weakened electorally since, according to surveys PRRI and Pew published in May 2024, the majority of religious populations, both Christian and non-Christian, say they are in favour of preserving this right. The only exceptions are the majority of white evangelicals and a few other groups.\n\n(The Associated Press, Alex Brandon)\n\nIn terms of the political sensibilities of ethnoreligious groups, the numerical decline of evangelicals, the rise of the unaffiliated and the demographic growth of Hispanics create challenges for political strategists and researchers \u2014 especially as individual choices appear to be less automatic than before.\n\nFor some time now, certain Mormons have been distancing themselves from Trump. Biden lost support in some ethnic communities (African Americans, Latinos, Indigenous people). Some Hispanics have turned to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nTraditionally polarized in favour of the Republican Party, white evangelicals remain a political force, aided by their high-profile leaders. At the same time, African-American Protestants and a host of small non-Christian groups are equally polarized in favour of the Democratic Party. And that\u2019s not counting the religiously unaffiliated.\n\nBy contrast, although Republican presidential candidates have been supported by the majority of white mainline Protestants as well as by the majority of Catholics since 2016, these two worlds remain the most politically divided. This is increasingly the case for Hispanics. This makes these voters strategic.\n\nAlso, the Muslim, Jewish or Indigenous vote could create local surprises. All these elements are liable to rupture the usual dividing line between partisan identities.\n\nAt the moment\n\nAfter the Biden-Trump rematch was cancelled, followed by a handover from Biden to Harris and a rallying of Kennedy to Trump, will this campaign result in a reshuffling of ethnoreligious cards?\n\nAgainst a backdrop of polarized male and female voting, the recent Pew poll shows that the political leanings of ethnoreligious groups have moved very little since the spring, when Biden emerged weakened. Harris has won back a solid number of Black Protestants and especially Hispanic Catholics. The majority (52 per cent) of Catholics remains pro-Trump, with the gap narrowing. On the other hand, the EWTN News/Real Clear poll indicates that half (50 per cent) of Catholics are now leaning towards Harris.\n\nAt a time when every vote counts, the slightest changes in partisan leanings, or in voter mobilization rates of different ethnic and religious groups, could play an unexpected role in several key states.",

        "summary": " The US is electing a wartime president. Neither candidate has yet spoken plainly enough to the American people about the perils represented by the growing geopolitical and defense industrial collaboration among China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea. This axis of aggressors may be unprecedented in the potential peril it represents.",
        "text": "The US is electing a wartime president\nAmericans on November 5 will be electing a wartime president. This isn\u2019t a prediction. It\u2019s reality.\n\nNeither candidate has yet spoken plainly enough to the American people about the perils represented by the growing geopolitical and defense industrial collaboration among China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea. This axis of aggressors may be unprecedented in the potential peril it represents.\n\nNeither candidate has outlined the sort of generational strategy that will be required by the United States to address this challenge. Irrespective of whether former President Donald Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris is elected, this will be the unavoidable context of their presidency. One will become commander-in-chief at the most perilous geopolitical moment since the Cold War\u2014and perhaps since World War II.\n\nIn that spirit, Washington Post columnist George F. Will this week compared the 2024 US elections to the 1940 US elections, when the United States hadn\u2019t yet formally declared war on Imperial Japan, Hitler\u2019s Germany, or Mussolini\u2019s Italy.\n\nWhat was different then was that one of the two candidates, incumbent President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, sensed he was about to become a wartime president and was acting like it. FDR, wrote Will, \u201cwas nudging a mostly isolationist nation toward involvement in a global conflict\u201d with his 1937 \u201cquarantine speech\u201d on aggressor nations and through his subsequent military buildup.\n\nFDR\u2019s opponent was Republican businessman Wendell Willkie, who like FDR was more internationalist than isolationist, in the tradition of his party\u2019s elites of that time. \u201cIn three weeks,\u201d Will writes, \u201cAmericans will not have a comparably reassuring choice when they select the president who will determine the nation\u2019s conduct during World War III, which has begun.\u201d\n\nThe point is that just as World War II began with \u201ca cascade of crises,\u201d initiated by the coalescing axis of Japan, Germany, and Italy, so today there is a similar axis\u2014China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea. Will reckons our current global crisis began no later than Russia\u2019s 2014 seizure of Crimea.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that I have quoted diplomat-historian Philip Zelikow in this column. Writing in Texas National Security Review this summer, Zelikow reckoned that the next president has a 20-30 percent chance of being involved in worldwide warfare, which he differentiates from a world war in that not all parties will be involved in every aspect or region.\n\nZelikow, who recently expanded on these ideas among experts at the Atlantic Council, reckons that the next three years mark a moment of maximum danger. Should the United States navigate this period successfully, alongside global allies and partners, the underlying strengths of the American economy, defense industry, tech, and society should kick in and show their edge over those of the authoritarians.\n\nThe problem in the short term is that the United States is facing challengers in Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, who may see a window of opportunity in the United States\u2019 domestic distractions, a defense sector not yet adequate for emerging challenges, and an electorate that questions the value and necessity of US international engagement. Both leaders might calculate that acting more forcefully against Ukraine and Taiwan now could produce a greater chance of success than a few years in the future.\n\nWrote George Will: \u201cFrom Russia\u2019s western border to the waters where China is aggressively encroaching on Philippine sovereignty, the theater of today\u2019s wars and almost-war episodes spans six of the globe\u2019s 24 time zones.\u201d He says this is what \u201cthe gathering storm\u201d of world war looks like, borrowing the title of the first volume of Winston Churchill\u2019s World War II memoirs.\n\nWill charges the two presidential candidates with \u201creckless disregard\u201d for failing to provide voters \u201cany evidence of awareness, let alone serious thinking about, the growing global conflagration.\u201d\n\nIf that sounds like hyperbole to you, it\u2019s worth reading FDR\u2019s third inaugural address in January 1941, almost a year before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, which prompted Congress to declare war on Japan the following day.\n\n\u201cTo us there has come a time,\u201d said Roosevelt, \u201cin the midst of swift happenings, to pause for a moment and take stock\u2014to recall what our place in history has been, and to rediscover what we are and what we may be. If we do not, we risk the real peril of isolation, the real peril of inaction. Lives of nations are determined not by the count of years, but by the lifetime of the human spirit.\u201d\n\nWar isn\u2019t inevitable now any more than it was then. When disregarded, however, gathering storms of the sort we\u2019re navigating gain strength.\n\n\u201cIn the face of great perils never before encountered,\u201d Roosevelt concluded, \u201cour strong purpose is to protect and to perpetuate the integrity of democracy. For this we muster the spirit of America, and the faith of America.\u201d\n\nFrederick Kempe is president and chief executive officer of the Atlantic Council.

        "text": "North Carolina Tops 1 Million Votes Cast\nRaleigh, N.C.\n\nAs of 4 p.m. Sunday, the fourth day of in-person early voting in North Carolina, more than 1 million voters had cast ballots in the 2024 general election, according to preliminary State Board of Elections data.\n\nThis turnout total \u2014 1,008,123 ballots cast \u2014 is broken down into the following voting methods:\n\nIn-person early voting: 916,433\n\nAbsentee (civilian): 77,831\n\nAbsentee (overseas): 11,168\n\nAbsentee (military): 2,691\n\nThe ballots cast number represents a statewide turnout of about 13 percent of North Carolina\u2019s nearly 7.8 million registered voters.\n\nNote: These numbers are slightly lower than the actual turnout, as there is a lag between when a voter casts a ballot and when county boards of elections upload this data to the State Board.\n\n\u201cMy sincerest thanks goes out to the county boards of elections and the thousands of election workers around the state who are making this happen,\u201d said Karen Brinson Bell, executive director of the State Board. \u201cIt has been an incredibly busy few days. Please thank those in your community who are making sure your vote counts.\u201d\n\nThrough Saturday, nearly 863,000 voters had cast ballots during the first three days of the in-person early voting period. That\u2019s an increase of 2.4 percent over 2020, when nearly 843,000 voters had cast ballots after three days of in-person voting. In 2020, more voters voted absentee ballots because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe State Board publishes daily turnout reports on its website.\n\nIn-person early voting runs through Saturday, Nov. 2, and sites and schedules vary by county. Some counties do not offer Sunday voting. To view county-by-county schedules, use the Early Voting Site Search tool.",

        "text": "A Saturday in presidential crosshairs for Nebraska\u2019s 2nd District \u2022 Nebraska Examiner\nOMAHA \u2014 Nebraska\u2019s 2nd District bathed in the attention Saturday of presidential surrogates befitting a swing state, not the most populous part of a conservative state that Republicans rule.\n\nThe presidential campaigns of former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris held dueling rallies in parts of the district each would like to win \u2014 east Omaha and the suburbs.\n\nTrump sent former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and former U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, to the Hilton Omaha hotel downtown to appeal to traditional Democratic voters in the east.\n\nHarris sent Nebraska native Tim Walz, Minnesota\u2019s governor and her running mate, to Papillion\u2019s SumTur Amphitheater, aimed at traditional Republican voters to the west and south of Omaha.\n\nValue of the 2nd District vote\n\nBoth drew significant crowds. Nebraska Democrats filled most of SumTur\u2019s seats and grassy expanse, drawing more than 1,700 people, based on campaign estimates.\n\nNebraska Republicans filled Hilton\u2019s grand ballroom to capacity and spilled over into the hallway. Republicans helping organize the rally estimated it drew more than 1,000 people.\n\nKennedy and Gabbard stressed the importance of Nebraska\u2019s 2nd District to scenarios where Trump\u2019s ability to win could come down to the district\u2019s single stray Electoral College vote.\n\nNebraska and Maine award a single electoral vote to the winner of the presidential popular vote in each congressional district. In Nebraska, that leaves one up for grabs in the Omaha area.\n\n\u201cIt is still the most critical election in this country,\u201d Kennedy said of the 2nd District presidential contest. \u201cWe could still end up 269 to 269 (in electoral votes).\u201d\n\nTo win the presidency, a candidate must secure 270 electoral votes. In a tie, the presidential election would go to the House of Representatives, with each state\u2019s House delegation getting a single vote.\n\nWalz did the same, saying Harris sent him to make sure people know they could help cement her presidency and help Americans turn the page from the time of Trump.\n\n\u201cThis state and this district are showing the rest of the country that democracy runs right through here,\u201d Walz said of the 2nd District\u2019s Douglas, Saunders and part of Sarpy Counties.\n\nHistory behind \u2018blue dot\u2019\n\nOne of the reasons behind the full court press for hearts and minds in the 2nd District kicked off Walz\u2019s rally: former Nebraska Gov. and former U.S. Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb.\n\nNelson told the crowd he was pleased to see the attention paid to Nebraska from legislation he signed as governor in the 1990s and that he preserved with vetoes of GOP efforts to change it.\n\nNebraska Republicans have tried for years to shift the state to winner-take-all, stopped largely by the quirks of its one-house, officially nonpartisan Legislature that requires 33 of 49 votes to overcome a filibuster, a tactic often deployed against controversial proposals.\n\nThey tried this summer to find a 33rd vote, now that Republicans hold 33 seats. But a former Democrat-turned-GOP lawmaker, State Sen. Mike McDonnell, backed what he called the \u201cgreen dot.\u201d\n\nHe calls it that because the district has drawn tens of millions in advertising and campaign investments seeking the electoral vote, including more than $20 million this year.\n\nTrue swing district\n\nThe swing nature of the district is evident in the past four presidential election results. The 2nd District backed Democrats in 2008 and 2020 and Republicans in 2012 and 2016.\n\nOne of the quirks of the election this year is that Harris\u2019 campaign has outspent Trump by more than $20 million in ads. The Harris campaign has also put more staff on the ground.\n\nSome Republican candidates, including U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., who represents the 2nd District, have complained that the lack of spending by Trump\u2019s campaign put them in a more precarious position.\n\nNo members of Nebraska\u2019s all-GOP federal congressional delegation attended the Trump campaign\u2019s rally Saturday. Three of the Democrats\u2019 federal candidates attended Walz\u2019s rally.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s ability to motivate grassroots Republicans remains strong. Republicans who spoke to the Nebraska Examiner said they were excited to vote for Trump and mentioned the cost of living.\n\nBacon\u2019s opponent, State Sen. Tony Vargas of Omaha, urged Walz rally attendees to volunteer for his campaign and to help candidates up and down the ballot.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s elect Kamala Harris and Tim Walz to show the world the power of Nebraska, the power of the \u2018blue dot,\u2019\u201d Vargas said Saturday, referencing what Democrats call the 2nd District.\n\nReinforcements arrive\n\nReinforcements have come. House Speaker Mike Johnson visited the 2nd District on Friday for Bacon. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries is visiting Sunday for Vargas.\n\nDemocrats attending the rally who spoke to the Examiner said they were motivated to make sure Harris wins and to keep Trump from having a second term. They emphasized reproductive rights.\n\nWalz\u2019s speech played to the middle. He stressed the need to get the country back to a place where people can disagree politically without treating one another like enemies.\n\nWalz talked about the need to get health care costs under control and the need to continue to invest in the future of American manufacturing and education.\n\nThe Walz rally featured local voters who have supported Republicans but back Harris, including Blaine McKillip of Omaha, who said he could not support Trump\u2019s departure from norms, including his unwillingness to accept his 2020 loss.\n\nKennedy and Gabbard banked toward the middle, too, in a different way. The two stressed voter fatigue with higher grocery prices and war in Europe and the Middle East.\n\nBoth said they were tired of letting the military industrial complex cost Americans billions of tax dollars and thousands of servicemembers\u2019 lives. Kennedy said intelligence services are in charge of the government.\n\nKennedy ran for president as a Democrat before trying as a nonpartisan. Nebraska Secretary of State Bob Evnen recently removed him from the Nebraska ballot at his campaign\u2019s request.\n\nKennedy visited Nebraska while he was still running. He said Saturday that one of his goals was to win the 2nd District. Saturday was Walz\u2019s second rally in Nebraska this cycle.\n\nMotivating middle and the base\n\nWalz, Kennedy and Gabbard also drew loud applause with partisan appeals, too.\n\nWalz riled up the crowd over abortion rights and his \u201cmind your own damn business\u201d line about personal privacy. He said regular people would pay more for items they rely on under Trump\u2019s tariffs.\n\nKennedy and Gabbard drew loud applause for talking about the impact on families of post-pandemic inflation and how federal spending has made housing and bills less affordable.\n\nBoth have been mentioned as possible participants in a second Trump administration.\n\nIn a campaign that could be decided by the energy of volunteers down the stretch, both sides spelled out the stakes. Walz said the country can\u2019t afford Trump\u2019s assault on democracy.\n\nGabbard said Americans can\u2019t afford to let neo-conservatives who prefer war to peace keep making decisions about arming Ukraine that she said could lead to wider war.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud to be here to support President Trump tonight,\u201d Gabbard said.\n\nSpeakers at both rallies argued that the competing party had forgotten about working people. And both said to expect door-knockers, mailers, phone calls and texts through Nov. 5.\n\n\u201cOne dot makes the difference,\u201d Walz said.\n\nSaid Gabbard: \u201cLook at the facts of the record for four years under President Trump and four years under Kamala Harris and Joe Biden, and let that motivate your vote.\u201d",

Both Harris and Trump, and their respective vice-presidential running mates, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Ohio Senator JD Vance, are making few campaign stops in any place but seven key states .",
        "text": "Harris, Trump battle for 7 states in final election sprint\nThe U.S. presidential campaign is culminating in a final sprint to the official Election Day on November 5, with Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris and her Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump, focused almost exclusively on seven political battleground states that most likely will determine the outcome.\n\nMore than 14 million people have already cast early ballots, according to the University of Florida\u2019s Election Lab, and more will do so in the coming days as almost all the country\u2019s 50 states open polling stations for early voting and to accept mail-in ballots.\n\nNational polls show the contest is among the closest in decades, with Harris holding a slight edge.\n\nU.S. presidential elections are not decided by the national popular vote but rather through the Electoral College vote, which turns the election into 50 state-by-state contests, with 48 of the 50 states awarding all their electoral votes to the winner in their states, either Harris or Trump, while Nebraska and Maine allocate theirs by both state and congressional district vote counts.\n\nThe number of electoral votes in each state is based on population, so the biggest states hold the most sway in determining the overall national outcome, with the winner needing 270 of the 538 electoral votes to claim a new four-year term in the White House starting in January.\n\nPolls show either Harris or Trump holds substantial or somewhat comfortable leads in 43 of the states. Barring an upset in one of those states, that leaves the outcome to the remaining seven states \u2013 a northern tier of three states (Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania), two states in the Southeast (North Carolina and Georgia) and two in the Southwest (Arizona and Nevada).\n\nPolling in the seven states is easily within the margins of statistical error, leaving the outcome in doubt in all seven.\n\nAs a result, both Harris and Trump, and their respective vice-presidential running mates, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Ohio Senator JD Vance, are making few campaign stops in any place but the seven key states, a travel schedule that is likely to hold through the last two weeks of the campaign.\n\nHarris celebrated her 60th birthday Sunday by speaking at the New Birth Missionary Baptist Church in Stonecrest, Georgia, about 50 kilometers (31 miles) east of the state\u2019s major city, the Democratic stronghold of Atlanta. She told of her childhood experiences in a Black church, drawing a sharp contrast to the harsh and divisive rhetoric of the current political climate, although she did not mention Trump by name.\n\nThen she headed to Divine Faith Ministries International in Jonesboro, just south of Atlanta, where she encouraged worshippers to exercise their voting rights. Later, she planned to record an interview with civil rights leader Al Sharpton.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump, donned an apron at a McDonald\u2019s fast-food restaurant in Pennsylvania to work in the French fries part of the kitchen and handed orders to customers in the drive-through lane.\n\nHarris has said she worked for spending money at a McDonald\u2019s in California during her college days, but Trump has said he doesn\u2019t believe her, although a friend of Harris\u2019 told The New York Times that she recalled Harris working there.\n\nAfter his brief stint at the restaurant, Trump boasted that he\u2019d \u201cnow worked for 15 minutes\u201d longer than Harris had.\n\nLater in the day, Trump scheduled a town hall gathering with voters in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.\n\nHarris is campaigning Monday in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, while Trump heads to Greenville, North Carolina.",

And the White House firsts will continue through Election Day, whether it's Kamala Harris or Donald Trump who is elected.\n\nEach party can make history by winning the election, whether for reasons of precedent or infamy.\n\nPossibly outcomes will mark something that has not been done since as far back as the mid-1800s when James Buchanan was in office. And speaking of firsts, Buchanan was the first and only president who never married. His niece, Harriet Lane, acted as first lady while he was in office.\n\nWe've got the news you need to know to start your day. Sign up for the First & 4Most morning newsletter \u2014 delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.\n\nUse that, and the potential firsts from this year's election listed below, as a conversation starter with fellow voters while waiting on line at the polls.\n\nHas there ever been a woman president?\n\nHarris is the first women in the United States to be vice president and would be the first to be president.\n\nHarris, whose mother emigrated from India and whose father emigrated from Jamaica, would become the first president of Asian-American or South Asian descent.\n\nHas there ever been a First Gentleman?\n\nIf Harris is elected president, it would make her husband Doug Emhoff the country's first \"first gentleman.\"\n\nHas a president ever served non-consecutive terms?\n\nTrump, who held office from 2016 to 2020 before losing the ensuing election to Joe Biden, would be the first U.S. president to serve non-consecutive terms since Grover Cleveland in the late 1800s.\n\nCleveland was president from 1885 to 1889 and from 1893 to 1897.\n\nHas a president ever been convicted of a felony?\n\nTrump would become the first U.S. president to have been convicted of a felony. He was found guilty of 34 felony counts in his criminal trial over concealing hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels during his 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nTrump would also become the first president to take office after having previously been impeached.\n\nWho is the youngest vice president?\n\nJD Vance, at 40 years old, is the first millennial on a major party presidential ticket. But he would not become the youngest vice president.\n\nThat distinction is held by John C. Breckinridge, who became vice president at the age of 36 in 1857. Breckinridge, who was the running mate of James Buchanan, held office until 1861 when he ran for president and lost to Abraham Lincoln.\n\nHere\u2019s how to double check your registration status before you head to the polls.\n\nHas a California native ever been president?\n\nHarris, who was born in Oakland, would become the second president that is a California native. The first was Richard Nixon, who was from Yorba Linda.\n\nEven though many people think of Ronald Reagan as a Californian because was governor there before becoming president, he was actually born in Illinois and later migrated to the Golden State.\n\nTrump was the fifth president to have been born in New York. He joined Millard Fillmore, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Theodore Roosevelt and Martin Van Buren.\n\nWhich state has produced the most presidents?\n\nThere are 21 states with the distinction of being the birthplace of a U.S. president. Virginia has produced the most with eight -- George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, James Monroe, William Henry Harrison, Zachary Taylor, John Tyler, and Woodrow Wilson.\n\nNext is Ohio, which has produced seven: James A. Garfield, Ulysses S. Grant, Warren G. Harding, Benjamin Harrison, Rutherford B. Hayes, William McKinley and William Howard Taft.\n\nOhio, however, has never produced a vice president, which could change if Vance takes office.\n\nThere are several types of voter fraud that make headlines every election \u2013 but how common is voter fraud really? Here\u2019s what you need to know.",

Betting markets have already picked their President, check predictions\nHome\n\nNews\n\nUS Elections 2024: Can Trump Defeat Kamala Harris? Betting markets have already picked their President, check predictions\n\nUS Elections 2024: Can Trump Defeat Kamala Harris? Betting markets have already picked their President, check predictions\n\nThere are also increasing whispers that an individual or a group may be influencing Trump\u2019s odds on the betting platform Polymarket, having placed a series of substantial bets totalling USD 30 million.\n\n21 mUS Presidential Elections 2024: 21 million Americans have already casted their vote illion Americans have already casted vote in US Presidential Elections\n\nThe U.S. presidential election is less than three weeks away and several opinion polls show a tight race between Trump and Harris. But, what does the betting market indicate? The betting market is often considered a reliable predictor of American elections because people invest money in it. While traditional polling shows Harris with a slight edge, the betting odds indicate a shift in momentum toward Trump. There are also increasing whispers that an individual or a group may be influencing Trump\u2019s odds on the betting platform Polymarket, having placed a series of substantial bets totalling USD 30 million, according to a report by Business Insider.\n\nEarlier surveys suggested that Harris was slightly ahead of Trump, but the situation now seems to be shifting. According to Polymarket, as of October 15, former President Trump had a 60% chance of winning. The popular betting platform PredictIt has reported that more people are wagering on Trump\u2019s victory. Currently, Trump\u2019s chances of winning stand at 54%, while Harris\u2019s chances have dropped to 49%. This marks the first time since July that Harris has received support from less than 50% of the bettors.\n\nInsights from Predictions\n\nMost betting platforms are predicting a win for Trump. Betfair estimates his chances of victory at around 58%, while Kalshi puts it at 57%. PredictIt has Trump\u2019s winning probability at 54%, and Smarket also rates his chances at 58%. According to the poll of polls, Trump\u2019s chances of winning exceed 57%, a significant increase from approximately 48% at the end of September. This indicates a remarkable shift in the dynamics of the race since then.\n\nThe Contrasting Story of the Betting Market\n\nAccording to The New York Times\u2019 national survey tracker, 49% of voters plan to support Kamala Harris, while only 47% are backing Trump. However, the betting market tells a completely different story. Thomas Miller, a data science professor at Northwestern University, told Fortune that betting platforms tend to provide accurate predictions because real money is at stake. Miller runs a site that estimates electoral college outcomes based on PredictIt contract prices, which further indicates that Trump is likely to win by a significant margin.\n\nPolling data indicates a tough fight\n\nHowever, the polling data provides a more nuanced perspective. Poll aggregators like FiveThirtyEight indicate a slightly different scenario, with their averages showing Kamala Harris with a slight lead, garnering around 48-49% compared to Trump\u2019s 46-47%. Nonetheless, the more critical contest is unfolding in seven swing states, where Trump is again showing a slight advantage.\n\nThis trend aligns with Real Clear Politics\u2019 weighted averages, which indicate that Harris has a narrow lead of 49.2% to 47.7% over Trump.\n\nFor breaking news and live news updates, like us on Facebook or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.

        "text": "Who will win the presidential election? The Trump trade offers a clue\nThe so-called Trump trade is coming back as polls have started to tilt toward the former president in the election.\n\nAs a result of the electoral college\u2019s peculiarities, even slight changes in presidential polls in just a handful of states could signal a decisive shift toward either Donald Trump or Kamala Harris.\n\nAnd as the 2024 election enters the final stretch, polls could have more salience now. Election Day is Nov. 5, and early voting has already begun in some states, including in hotly contested Georgia and North Carolina.\n\nBased on 538\u2019s latest analysis of presidential polls, Trump now has the barest advantage in the race, with a 52-in-100 chance to win. Two weeks ago, Harris had a 58-in-100 chance to win. Still, 538 cautions that the race remains in a dead heat.\n\nWhile Harris maintains a slight lead in nationwide polls, it has narrowed in October. In addition, her leads in the key swing states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Nevada have also shrunk or vanished, while Trump has added to his leads in Georgia and North Carolina.\n\nTo be sure, many presidential polls in the past few cycles were well off the mark (and often underestimated Trump\u2019s support). As a result, some election watchers have turned to betting markets for a more accurate reading, arguing that those who put money on the line have a greater incentive to make an accurate call.\n\nBut recent a big shift on top prediction sites like Polymarket raised doubts about their accuracy as a few deep-pocketed bettors appeared to sway the odds toward Trump.\n\nThen there\u2019s actual financial markets, which try to anticipate election results as much as possible given that the next president could put trillions of dollars at stake.\n\nDuquesne Family Office founder and hedge fund manager Stanley Druckenmiller pointed to financial markets when he was asked about the election this past week, saying they appear \u201cvery convinced Trump is going to win.\u201d\n\nKey market signals include the Trump trade. When the former president looked like the favorite earlier this year, the U.S. dollar, Treasury yields, Bitcoin, and shares of Trump Media and Technology rose.\n\nThey retreated after Joe Biden dropped out of the race and Harris took his place on the Democratic ticket. But since October began, the Trump trade has rebounded.\n\nThe U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the greenback against a basket of top global currencies, has rallied 2% so far this month. The 10-year Treasury yield has surged about 40 basis points. That\u2019s as Trump\u2019s tariffs and tax cuts are expected to boost the dollar and deepen U.S. debt, putting upward pressure on bond yields.\n\nBitcoin has jumped 12% in October. Trump has rebranded himself as a champion of the crypto industry after previously dismissing Bitcoin as a \u201cscam.\u201d\n\nAnd shares of Trump Media, the parent company of Truth Social, have shot up 83% so far in October. The stock has already been on a wild ride this year, acting like a barometer of Trump\u2019s election prospects. It skyrocketed following Trump\u2019s first debate with Biden in June and again after Trump survived an assassination attempt in July.\n\nBut after Biden stepped aside, Trump Media stock tumbled, then sold off further last month as the end of the lockup period approached, allowing company insiders to sell their shares.\n\nOther parts of the Trump trade have been mixed, largely owing to factors beyond the election. Energy stocks, which could benefit from lighter GOP regulation, have been relatively flat after oil prices jumped then sank on the outlook for a wider conflict between Israel and Iran.\n\nThe financial and health sectors could also see less regulation under Trump. But insurance stocks slumped after UnitedHealth gave weak guidance in its earnings report, while bank stocks jumped on strong quarterly results.",

Donald Trump criticized her for skipping the Al Smith dinner in New York City, saying her absence was \u201cvery disrespectful to our great Catholic community\u201d",
        "text": "Harris goes to church, highlighting the absence of religion in the 2024 campaign\nReligion is making a rare appearance on the campaign trail in a presidential election that has dwelled less on candidates\u2019 personal faiths than any in recent memory.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris attended services and spoke at the New Birth Missionary Baptist Church outside Atlanta on Sunday, while her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, visited Victorious Believers Ministries in Saginaw, Michigan.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump on Thursday criticized Harris for skipping the Al Smith dinner in New York City, a high-profile fundraiser for Catholic charities, saying her absence was \u201cvery disrespectful to our great Catholic community.\u201d Harris instead sent a video.\n\nWhile candidates in both parties have traditionally sought to play up their piety to appeal to religious voters and signal their personal integrity, Harris, Trump and their running mates have not centered their faith this year.\n\nThat\u2019s a marked contrast from President Joe Biden, a lifelong Catholic who regularly attends services, quotes hymns and figures like St. Augustine, and can be seen on Ash Wednesday with ash on his forehead.\n\nBarack Obama\u2019s religion was a major factor in his 2008 campaign, both for its influence on his oratory and the criticism of his relationship with his former pastor Jeremiah Wright, a controversial figure whom Obama ended up rebuking.\n\nObama cut his teeth in Chicago as a community organizer working for a coalition of Catholic churches. And his comfort in religious settings was apparent throughout his presidency, from the five times he invoked God in his first inaugural address to his impromptu singing of \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d at Mother Emanuel AME Church after a white supremacist killed nine people at the historic Black church in Charleston, South Carolina.\n\nBut the U.S. has grown even more secular in the eight years since Obama left office, with a record 28% of adults now identifying as religiously unaffiliated, according to the Pew Research Center, surpassing evangelical Protestants and Catholics to now be the largest religious group in the country.\n\nAs recently as 2007, when Obama was preparing his first presidential run, the religiously unaffiliated \u2014 who include people who identify as atheists, agnostics and \u201cnothing in particular\u201d \u2014 made up just 16% of the country in Pew\u2019s data.\n\nAnd presidential historian Michael Beschloss said Americans have grown more cynical about their politicians and what their religious affiliations might say about their character.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve learned a lot about a lot of politicians who seemed to be very religious but did not necessarily follow the tenets of their faith in one way or another,\u201d said Beschloss, noting religion has become as much about policy as personality. \u201cSo for many people, religion may no longer say much about someone\u2019s personal character.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s now less incentive for candidates to play up their religiosity \u2014 and even potential peril with irreligious voters, especially on the left \u2014 said Massimo Faggioli, a Villanova University theology professor who wrote a spiritual biography of Biden.\n\nAnd Harris and Trump, along with their running mates, have complicated religious backgrounds that are harder to \u201csell\u201d politically than Biden\u2019s familiar Catholicism, he said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s secularism on one side and a more complicated religious mix on the other side,\u201d said Faggioli. \u201cAnd for Harris, there\u2019s a risk where religion is associated in the eyes of some voters as a form of oppression.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s coalition is powered in large part by evangelical Christians, but their support for him is based more on a shared political agenda than a spiritual connection. Just 8% of people who had positive views of Trump earlier this year thought he was \u201cvery\u201d religious, according to Pew.\n\nTrump was raised Presbyterian but in 2020 said he considers himself a nondenominational Christian, though he is not known to attend services regularly.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no pretense anymore that this is a true love story. It\u2019s a marriage of convenience,\u201d said Faggioli. \u201cThe relationship has become much more transactional.\u201d\n\nIndeed, at the Al Smith dinner, Trump made that plain: \u201cCatholics, you\u2019ve got to vote for me. You better remember: I\u2019m here, and she\u2019s not.\u201d\n\nHarris, on the other hand, is a rare political figure who may have downplayed her spiritual life in public, given anti-religious sentiments in her native San Francisco Bay Area and a complicated personal religious journey.\n\nHarris is a Baptist who was raised by a Black Anglican father and an Indian Hindu mother, and she is married to a Reform Jewish husband.\n\nShe\u2019s a longtime member of San Francisco\u2019s historic Third Baptist Church and has a deep relationship with its pastor, the Rev. Amos Brown. As vice president, she has attended services at Baptist churches in the Washington, D.C., area and in 2022 spoke at the National Baptist Convention.\n\nBrown, whose campaign for the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1999 she managed, was one of the first people Harris called after Biden decided not to run for re-election.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a strong, spiritual person who comes from a strong, spiritual family that we\u2019ve known for a very long time now,\u201d Brown said in an interview with a newspaper in his native Mississippi earlier this year.\n\nHarris\u2019 husband, Doug Emhoff, said in his Democratic National Convention speech that \u201cKamala has connected me more deeply to my faith\u201d and that they attend both synagogue and church on holy days.\n\nIn her 2019 memoir, Harris wrote about her mother\u2019s making sure she was exposed to both Hindu and African American Christian religious traditions, adding that she and her sister, Maya, sang in the choir at 23rd Avenue Church of God in Oakland.\n\n\u201cI believe we must live our faith and show faith in action,\u201d she wrote.\n\nBut aside from asking Brown to give the closing prayer at the convention this summer and some occasional references to her church, especially when she speaks with Black audiences, Harris rarely speaks of God, and her oratorical style is more prosecutor than preacher.\n\n\u201cI grew up in the Black church,\u201d Harris told radio host Charlamagne Tha God last week when a pastor asked about partnering with faith communities. \u201cOur God is a loving God. Our faith propels us to act in a way that is about kindness and justice, mercy.\u201d\n\nShe contrasted that with what she said was Trump\u2019s belief that strength is \u201cwho you beat down,\u201d which she called \u201cabsolutely contrary to the church I know.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, Harris spoke at New Missionary Baptist Church about how faith can guide people.\n\n\"When the way is not clear, it is our faith that then guides us forward \u2014 faith in what we often cannot see but we know to be true,\" she said.\n\n\"I say that because in this moment across our nation, what we do see are some who try to deepen division among us, spread hate, sow fear and cause chaos,\" she added. \"There are those who suggest that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down instead of what we know, which is the true measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up.\"\n\nWalz was raised Catholic but became Lutheran after he married his wife, Gwen. Lutheranism is a major Protestant denomination, but in the U.S. it is almost entirely concentrated in the Upper Midwest, with little salience in the rest of the country, where it accounts for just a small percentage of the population.\n\nWalz rarely speaks about his religion, joking at times that his Midwestern sensibilities make it difficult to open up.\n\n\u201cBecause we\u2019re good Minnesota Lutherans, we have a rule: If you do something good and talk about it, it no longer counts,\u201d he joked at a speech to trade unions this year.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump\u2019s running mate, Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, has written about his own personal journey. Raised evangelical but rarely attending services, he became an atheist as a young adult before he converted to conservative Catholicism as an adult.\n\nVance\u2019s wife, Usha, grew up Hindu in a \u201creligious household,\u201d and she and Vance were married in an interfaith ceremony that included both Bible readings and a Hindu pandit.\n\nThose stories of conversion, intermarriage and back-seat religiosity reflect the spiritual life of Americans today but may not make for tidy stories on the stump.\n\n\u201cIf you are not comfortable talking about religion, it really shows, so it makes sense not to,\u201d said Faggioli.",

Harris has support of a dozen of billionaires, including hedge fund manager George Soros and investor Mark Cuban\n\nWhile Trump\u2019s billionaire supporters have provided him with a lifeline, Harris has outpaced him in overall fundraising.(AP Photo)\n\nRunning for US President is a costly affair. Billions of dollars have gone into the campaigning of presidential candidates \u2014 Donald Trump and Kamala Harris \u2013 with some of the powerful megadonors making humungous donations to their favourite runner.\n\nWhile US Vice President Harris leads in overall fundraising, Trump has received an extraordinary level of support from some influential billionaires who have pumped in hundreds of millions of dollars into the Super Political Action Committee (PAC) backing his campaign.\n\nThe amount of money being injected into 2024 races means this election cycle is poised to become the most expensive federal election ever, according to a new analysis released by the research group OpenSecrets.\n\nWho are Trump\u2019s Donors?\n\nThe most significant financial contributors to Trump\u2019s campaign include Miriam Adelson, Elon Musk, Richard Uihlein, and Timothy Mellon. Collectively, they have donated over $350 million to super PACs supporting Trump.\n\nElon Musk: The Tesla CEO has given almost $75 million in three months of his Trump-supporting PAC. Musk, who has always been hesitant of engaging in politics, has become an increasingly influential figure in Republican politics, using his X feed to echo GOP anxieties over immigration and transgender issues. His contributions mark his first direct involvement in Trump\u2019s campaign. This group made one of the largest voter outreach operations in the country, focusing heavily on canvassing efforts in battleground states like Pennsylvania. To date, America PAC has spent nearly $96 million on the 2024 presidential race, including over $57 million on field operations.\n\nMiriam Adelson: The widow of casino magnate Sheldon Adelson and a staunch Israel supporter, Miriam has donated $95 million to Trump\u2019s PAC campaign during the third quarter of the year, bringing her total donations to the group to $100 million for this cycle. This super PAC has invested in advertising efforts in key swing states. \u2018Preserve America\u2019 has already spent nearly $92 million in independent expenditures, primarily on TV ads designed to sway voters in states such as Michigan and Wisconsin. Adelson and her late husband were Trump\u2019s biggest donors in 2020.\n\nRichard Uihlein: The Uihleins, founders of the shipping company ULine, poured nearly $49 million into their conservative Restoration PAC in the last quarter of the year, according to the Federal Election Commission (FEC) filing. Restoration PAC has spent millions on both the presidential race and several House contests, with significant expenditures targeting key battleground states such as Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Georgia. Dick and Liz Uihlein have given $10 million to the Make America Great Again super PAC, the Post reported.\n\nTimothy Mellon: Billionaire businessman Timothy Mellon is one of Trump\u2019s biggest backers, having given the pro-Trump Super PAC $125 million this election cycle, per OpenSecrets, making him the largest one of the largest contributors in the election campaigns.\n\nWho Are Harris\u2019 Most Important Donors?\n\nHarris trails Trumps in endorsements from the mega-rich as she has the support of almost a dozen billionaires, including familiar names such as hedge fund manager and philanthropist George Soros and investor and television personality Mark Cuban.\n\nGeorge Soros: The Founder of Soros Fund Management, known for throwing millions at philanthropic and political causes, immediately supported Harris after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race. His son and heir, Alex Soros, posted about their support in July. The Soros are the old guard of Democratic big-money politics, and George supports more establishment-minded groups, and likes to fund organisations that try to build change over the long term.\n\nMike Bloomberg: The former mayor of New York City has had a frosty relationship with Joe Biden, and hasn\u2019t invested much this time in the campaigning. He has contributed $19 million to Future Forward, that had supported Biden\u2019s re-election bid, and is now supporting Harris, as per Politico. He has also donated $7 million to a super PAC associated with Everytown for Gun Safety and $10 million to House Majority PAC, a group that supports Democrats in House races, the Post reported.\n\nReid Hoffman and Michelle Lee: Tech billionaire Hoffman, the founder of LinkedIn, signed onto a letter with fellow venture capitalists, including Cuban, declaring their support for Harris\u2019 White House bid. That letter called Harris\u2019 election, \u201cthe best way to support the continued strength, security and reliability of our democracy and economy\". They have given $10 million this cycle to the Future Forward PAC supporting Harris\u2019 campaign, per The Washington Post. They have also donated $6 million to the anti-Trump Republican Accountability PAC and more than $2 million to the One for All Committee, a left-leaning super PAC that aims to convince \u201cmoderate women\" to support Democrats.\n\nDifference between Trump and Harris\u2019 Fundraising Efforts\n\nA total of 79 billionaires (or more) are backing Harris. While Trump\u2019s billionaire supporters have provided him with a lifeline, Harris has outpaced him in overall fundraising.\n\nThe Harris Victory Fund, which raises money for both Harris\u2019 campaign and Democratic groups, raised $633.2 million between July 1 and September 30, according to a FEC filing.\n\nTrumps National Committee JFC, which raises money for Trump\u2019s campaign and the Republican National Committee, took in only $194.5 million during that same period, while the ex-president\u2019s Trump 47 Committee, a different joint fundraising committee that collects funds from bigger donors, raised $145.2 million.\n\nHarris\u2019 two joint fundraising committees raised a combined $650 million during the third quarter, nearly double the amount raised by Trump\u2019s equivalent committees.\n\nFF PAC has spent over $371 million on advertising efforts throughout the 2024 cycle, dwarfing the expenditures of Trump\u2019s super PACs. It is the largest single outside advertiser in the presidential race, and its impact has been felt across swing states.\n\nAccording to CNN, Trump held a major fundraiser at his Mar-a-Lago estate on Wednesday night, with top donors contributing up to $924,600 each as his campaign works to close the gap in fundraising and secure a victory in November.\n\nMajority PAC, aligned with Senate Democrats, raised $119 million in the third quarter, slightly surpassing its Republican counterpart, the Senate Leadership Fund, which raised $116 million. This dynamic has created a competitive fundraising environment in which wealthy donors from both sides of the aisle are playing pivotal roles.\n\nFirst Published: October 18, 2024, 17:03 IST",

        "text": "Everything you need to know about the 7 swing states that could decide the election\nThe US election will likely be decided in the seven highly competitive swing states of Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina, Michigan, Arizona, Wisconsin, and Nevada. Within these, there are various combinations that Kamala Harris or Donald Trump could secure to make it to the 270 electoral college votes needed to win.\n\nIf both candidates win all the states that solidly and likely lean their way, Harris would still need 44 electoral votes from the tossup states to win, and Trump would need 51. Here\u2019s a roadmap of each candidate\u2019s route through the swing states to the White House, and the key voters and issues in each state, in order of their number of electoral votes.\n\nPennsylvania is arguably the most important battleground state because it has 19 electoral votes, the most of any swing state, and it's hard to imagine either candidate winning the White House without it. According to election analyst Nate Silver, the candidate who wins Pennsylvania has more than a 90% chance of winning the White House.\n\nPennsylvania historically trended slightly blue, but in recent years the state has purpled. The state House is divided and the last few general elections have been decided on razor-thin margins. That was until the 2022 governor\u2019s race when Democrat Josh Shapiro triumphed over a Trump-backed Republican by almost fifteen points, and his approval ratings in the state remain strong.\n\nWhen it comes to the issues and key demographics, Pennsylvania is a mini America. The economy is transitioning from manufacturing to newer industries, and agriculture is still the state\u2019s second largest industry. It also has a massive energy sector \u2013 where fracking is and the green energy transition are major issues.\n\nDemographically, the majority of the population is white, but the immigrant population is increasing. Twelve percent of the population is black, just under the national total of 13%. The two major cities, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, lean blue, and the vast rural stretches between them are dominated by Republicans.\n\nHarris currently leads by less than 1 point, meaning it\u2019s a dead tie. In 2020, Joe Biden only won the state by 1.2 points.\n\nGeorgia has 16 electoral college votes, and after years of Republican dominance, Biden clinched the closest win in 2020, at just 0.2 points, largely thanks to the state's rapidly diversifying population, marking the first time a Democratic presidential candidate won the state in nearly three decades.\n\nIt has also been the site of a battle over whether votes would be hand-counted on election night, but a judge struck down the proposal this week, ruling it would be too disruptive.\n\nJust under half of the Peach State\u2019s population is non-white. Thirty-three percent of the population is Black, and both candidates are vying to win their vote. Strong Black voter turnout \u2013 key to Biden\u2019s Georgia victory in 2020 \u2013 was credited in large portion to the efforts of Stacey Abrams, who is also campaigning on Harris\u2019 behalf this election . But Trump is trying to win those voters to his side by focusing on his economic policies, illegal immigration, and inflation.\n\nHarris is also campaigning heavily on the state\u2019s abortion restrictions, in recognition that women, who comprise 51% of Georgia\u2019s population, could also play a crucial role in winning the state.\n\nAs of now, the state is leaning back toward its Republican roots. Trump is ahead there by two points.\n\nNorth Carolina, with 16 electoral votes,has been won by Republicans in every presidential election since 2012. But right now, the state is a toss-up, with Trump ahead by less than one point.\n\nTrump carried North Carolina in 2020 by just 70,000 votes, which has buoyed Democrats' hopes that this purple state could be winnable this year. The state is still reeling from Hurricane Helene, and Harris is trying to boost recovery efforts while Trump is criticizing and spread misinformation about FEMA not doing enough \u2013 or even being completely corrupt. He is also campaigning on illegal immigration and the economy.\n\nNext up is Michigan, which has 15 electoral college votes, and because it has the largest proportion of Arab Americans , it has become the nationwide epicenter for backlash over Biden\u2019s support for Israel's war in Gaza. During the Democratic primary in the state, more than 100,000 voters chose the \u201cuncommitted\u201d option on their ballots to push the US government to halt its military aid to Israel.\n\nMost of these voters realize a Trump administration would be even more supportive of Israel. But they feel unrecognized by the DNC, especially after the party decided not to have a pro-Palestine speaker at the DNC. As a result, the appeal of voting third-party, or not at all, is growing in the Great Lakes State.\n\nArizona, with 11 electoral votes, is the focal point of the nation\u2019s immigration debate thanks to its 372-mile-long border with Mexico. Trump is showing strength in this Sun Belt State and is ahead by 2 points, in large part because of support from the state\u2019s Hispanic voters. At his rallies in the state, Trump has repeatedly attacked Harris\u2019 record on immigration, because she was given a role by President Joe Biden to try to ease the border crisis.\n\nHowever, Democrats are banking that ballot measures codifying the right to abortion in the state will help drive turnout. Following the overturning of Roe v. Wade, state Republicans tried unsuccessfully to reinstate a 160-year-old near-total ban on terminating pregnancies, before the issue of whether to add the right to an abortion to the state constitution landed on the ballot to be decided in November.\n\nWisconsin, with 10 electoral votes,is a key component of the Democrats' clearest path to victory \u2013 which would be winning Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. Like in 2020, it has the potential to be a \u201ctipping point\u201d giving either candidate the edge. Wisconsin was once considered a reliably blue Rust Belt state. But it became a big-time battleground after Trump eked out a victory there in 2016.\n\nThe state is overwhelmingly white, and white working-class voters are a key group for both candidates. Notably, Harris garnered the endorsement of the local Teamsters union in Wisconsin despite national union representatives deciding not to back a candidate in the race and dispersed internal data showing a majority of members backed Trump.\n\nBut another important group is independent voters. While Wisconsin does not register voters by political party, the electorate is fairly evenly split between Democrats and Republicans, with a notable independent population in between. These independent voters helped Trump win the state in 2016 and helped Biden take the reins in 2020.\n\nThe biggest issues in the state are the economy, crime, and abortion. As things stand now, neither candidate has a lead, with Harris ahead by less than one vote.\n\nLast and with the least electoral weight, is Nevada. Harris currently leads \u2013 if you can call it that \u2013 by less than 1 percentage point in this Sun Belt swing state. That being said, it is tricky to predict because it has more registered independent voters than Democrats or Republicans. However, with just 6 electoral votes, it is much less likely to be decisive.\n\nOnce decidedly blue, the Democrats have been winning presidential elections here by smaller and smaller margins since 2000. It is also the most diverse battleground state, and Harris has shrunk Trump\u2019s lead since she took to the ticket.\n\nEven though the US economy has shown strong growth and job creation since Biden took the presidency, the post-COVID recovery has been slower in Nevada than elsewhere. At 5.1%, the state has one of the highest unemployment rates in the country. Trump has been campaigning in the state to lower taxes and lessen regulations.\n\nIt\u2019s war game time. Harris\u2019 most obvious strategy is Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. But this would get her to exactly 270 votes, and only if she won all of the states Biden won in 2020. This is risky. Any misstep, even just losing Nebraska\u2019s 2nd Congressional District, could lose her the presidency.\n\nIf she loses Pennsylvania, which she very well might, she\u2019d need to pick up one of the two Sun Belt states and one of the two Southern states to win \u2014 so long as she still carries Michigan and Wisconsin. There\u2019s also the chance she could repeat Biden\u2019s 2020 victory, winning Nevada, Arizona, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Georgia -- though that would be quite a blowout.If Trump loses Pennsylvania, he could reach 270 by winning the two swing states where he is ahead the most, Georgia and Arizona, as well as Wisconsin, Nevada, and Michigan.\n\nTrump\u2019s easiest path to victory is blocking Harris in Pennsylvania, Georgia, and North Carolina. To do this, Trump would need to exceed his 2020 performance in suburban counties. But like Harris, this strategy of winning exactly 270 leaves no room for error. All that we really know is that whoever wins Pennsylvania will be well on their way to winning the White House.",

        "text": "Kamala Harris Turns 60 As Age Plays Key Role In US Election\nKamala Harris turns 60 on Sunday in the final stretch of a knife-edge election battle with 78-year-old Donald Trump, who is now the oldest presidential candidate in US history. Age has been a crucial factor in a campaign that President Joe Biden quit over fears about his capacity, and where Harris has steadily taken aim at Trump's mental fitness for office.\n\nWith just over two weeks before Election Day, the Democratic vice president and the Republican billionaire are in a fierce race that polls suggest is effectively tied.\n\nThe two candidates will on Sunday again be in Pennsylvania, the battleground that is considered a must-win among the seven key states expected to decide the November 5 election.\n\nBiden passed the torch to Harris after a disastrous debate against Trump raised concerns in the Democratic Party about his mental sharpness.\n\nBut Trump's age has not appeared to be a deal-breaker for voters, as polls show a close battle.\n\n\"Now he's ducking debates and canceling interviews because of exhaustion,\" Harris told a rally Saturday in Atlanta, mocking his rambling, off-script speeches.\n\nWhile Donald Trump is canceling interviews and ducking debates from \u201cexhaustion,\u201d the American people are exhausted by his same old, tired playbook.\n\n\n\nHe is unfit to be President of the United States. pic.twitter.com/SxFfuCcGvt \u2014 Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) October 20, 2024\n\n\"He's called it the weave. But we here, we will call it nonsense,\" she added.\n\n'Across the finish line'\n\nHarris had also sought to goad Trump with a report on October 12 that described her \"excellent health\", but the ex-president's campaign noted he too is \"in perfect and excellent health to be Commander-in-Chief\".\n\nThe Republican running for a second go in the White House countered Harris's accusations with a marathon speech in Pennsylvania on Saturday, a day after saying she \"doesn't have the energy of a rabbit.\"\n\nBoth candidates are spending their final campaign days in pivotal battleground states, but so are their surrogates.\n\nTesla and SpaceX boss Elon Musk has personally hit the campaign trail in Pennsylvania, holding a series of events in the must-win state.\n\nSpeaking in the southeastern city of Harrisburg, he announced he would start to randomly distribute cash awards -- $1 million each day until the November 5 vote -- to a registered voter in the state who signed his organization's petition.\n\nHarris deployed surrogates in the form of pop stars Lizzo and Usher to make her case to voters.\n\nLizzo drew cheers when telling a Detroit rally that America was more than ready for its first woman president, dropping a reference to her own hit song: \"It's about damn time!\"\n\nOne of Atlanta's major stars, Usher, told voters there that \"I'm counting on you\" to get Harris's \"campaign across the finish line\" in Georgia.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

Millions of people will have their say on whether Donald Trump or Kamala Harris should be the next White House incumbent. Northeastern experts look at why the final votes are cast on a Tuesday. The U.S. presidential election has been held on a Tuesday in November ever since a federal law was passed in 1845 mandating that all states vote on the same day. AP Photo/David Goldman\n\nLONDON \u2014 On Tuesday, Nov. 5, millions of Americans will cast their votes to elect the 47th president of the United States.\n\nThe act of voting on the first Tuesday that follows a Monday in November is a tradition that reaches back almost 180 years.\n\nThe decision in 1845 to pass a federal law to nominate a midweek polling day in the fall to choose the most powerful leader in the free world has its roots in the industrial makeup of 19th-century America, says Jessica Linker, an assistant professor in history at Northeastern University.\n\nBy the middle of the 1800s, states were increasingly making the right to vote available to non-land owning white men over the age of 21 (equal voting rights were not achieved until the 1960s). With that expansion of the popular vote came a desire to streamline the presidential voting process and move away from the previous system that allowed states to hold elections within a 34-day period before the first Wednesday in December.\n\nAware that early voting declarations could have a bearing on turnout and even voting behavior in states voting later, Congress wanted to create a single election day.\n\nWhy did they select a Tuesday?\n\n\u201cThis is where agriculture comes in,\u201d Linker explains.\n\nCongress was keen, Linker says, to ensure the presidential polling day did not \u201cdisenfranchise\u201d the vast numbers of people working in the agricultural sector at the time.\n\n\u201cThey were aware that they had to call it at a time when it was not a difficulty to go to the polls,\u201d she explains, \u201cbecause the polls weren\u2019t necessarily down the street from you. You had to travel to them and so part of the logic was that people might need a day to travel. Traveling might be a two-day affair, and so that ruled out certain days of the week \u2014 and this is how they ended up with Tuesday.\u201d\n\nJessica Linker, an assistant professor at Northeastern University, is an expert in early American history. Photo by Alyssa Stone/Northeastern University\n\nWhy not a Wednesday?\n\nLinker says there were \u201ccalculations about what day of the week was not going to be a burden\u201d for the farming community, with Wednesdays ruled out because that was a popular market day in many places.\n\nReligion was also a factor, she notes. The centrality of Christianity to many of the country\u2019s population meant polling day could not be a Monday as that would involve potentially having to set off on a Sunday when most Christians would attend church.\n\nChristianity is also said to have played a part in specifying that polling day should be the Tuesday \u201cafter the first Monday,\u201d with the provision in place to prevent it from falling on Nov. 1 \u2014 a day that some Christians observe as All Saints\u2019 Day.\n\nNovember was selected also for agrarian reasons. It was after the harvest, before the planting season and avoided the arrival of the worst of the winter weather.\n\nBut Linker argues that mid-19th century America should not purely be seen as a nation of farmers \u2014 with New York, Philadelphia and Boston all thriving cities at the time. It was simply that urban dwellers would have been less of a consideration for politicians when selecting a nationwide polling date.\n\nNot strictly agricultural\n\n\u201cI would caution against talking about America [in this period] as being strictly agricultural because it has quite a few large cities that are taking part in the voting,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cThe agricultural aspect gets emphasized because that was their [Congress\u2019] concern when trying to figure out logistically, \u2018How are we going to do this?\u2019",

Here's what happens if there's a 269-269 Electoral College tie\n\ntoggle caption Allison Joyce/AFP via Getty Images\n\nIt\u2019s very unlikely \u2014 but theoretically possible \u2014 that the presidential election ends with a 269-269 tie in the Electoral College.\n\nThat would mean that neither Kamala Harris nor Donald Trump, who are locked in a toss-up race, wins enough electoral votes to become president.\n\nThis hasn't happened in modern American politics \u2014 it did happen back in 1800 \u2014 and after a renewed effort to change how Nebraska allocates its electoral votes failed, it is now looking even less likely that a tie would occur.\n\nBut if this year's election did end 269-269, the U.S. Constitution does have a plan for what happens next. Experts and scholars point to Article II of the Constitution as well as the 12th Amendment to outline how this would work.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nElaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who has written a lot about presidential elections and presidential nominations, said we \u201chave a pretty good rulebook\u201d for where things go if there is a tie.\n\nUltimately, she said, the election moves to the U.S. House of Representatives, where the newly elected members of Congress would have to be sworn in and then vote on who becomes president.\n\nThe way this would work is that each state \u2014 regardless of the size of the state\u2019s delegation \u2014 gets one vote.\n\n\u201cI don't know if they would deliberate or not or just take a poll,\u201d Kamarck said. \u201cIn some cases, it'd be pretty easy. And they would cast their vote for one of the people who finished in the Electoral College.\u201d\n\nBecause it is unlikely third-party candidates will win any electoral votes this year, each state would have to vote for either Trump or Harris.\n\n\u201cThe Constitution says you need a majority of the House delegations,\u201d Kamarck said. \u201cSo that would be 26 House delegations.\u201d\n\nRepublicans currently have an edge if it were to come to this, because the party right now has control of 26 U.S. House delegations and Democrats control 22 delegations. Two states \u2014 Minnesota and North Carolina \u2014 have split delegations. This, of course, could all change depending on what happens in this year\u2019s general election.\n\n\u201cWhat we're really saying here is if the Electoral College was really in a tie, then the outcome of House races and Senate races would be absolutely critical to the outcome of the [presidential] election,\u201d Kamarck said.\n\nShe mentioned the U.S. Senate because a similar process would play out there to decide who would become vice president. In that case, though, each senator gets a vote \u2014 instead of one vote per state like in the House. The candidate that gets to 51 votes becomes the vice president. And because these are separate votes, it is possible that the president and vice president could end up being from different political parties.\n\nIf the House can\u2019t get to 26 votes for a presidential candidate the first time, they would have to keep voting.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAnd if no candidate gets to 26 by Inauguration Day, the person chosen as vice president by the Senate will be acting president while the House continues to vote.\n\n\u201cThe House keeps voting and voting until the tie is broken,\u201d Kamarck said. \u201cSo, there is an end to it.\u201d",

        "text": "U.S. cybersecurity chief says election systems have \u2018never been more secure\u2019 \u2013 Houston Public Media\nJen Easterly, director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, told NPR that election officials across the U.S. have made big improvements to bolster both physical and cyber security.\n\nJen Easterly, director of the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, speaks at a meeting, Feb. 16, 2023, in Washington, D.C. (Patrick Semansky | AP)\n\nAmid widespread concerns of outside interference influencing the results this year's presidential election, the head of the country's cybersecurity agency says election infrastructure is more secure than ever.\n\nState and local election officials across the country have made big improvements to strengthen both physical and cyber security at polling and voting locations to preserve election integrity, said Jen Easterly, the director of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, in an interview with Weekend Edition.\n\nAfter Russia\u2019s attempts to influence the U.S. presidential election in 2016, CISA was created to work with state and local officials to make sure voting machines aren't vulnerable to hacks.\n\n\"I can say with confidence based on all the work that we\u2019ve done together since 2016, that election infrastructure has never been more secure,\" Easterly said. \"There are cyber threats, there are physical threats to election officials, but we\u2019re at a point now with our election infrastructure secure and the election community prepared to meet the moment on the 5th of November.\"\n\nHer confidence in election integrity comes as intelligence officials warn that foreign adversaries \u2014 mainly Russia, Iran and China \u2014 are stepping up efforts to undermine voter trust in the democratic process, sway voters and inflame partisan divisions.\n\nMost Americans are concerned about voter fraud in this year's general election, fueled by election misinformation and distrust in free and fair elections, according to a recent NPR/PBS News/Marist poll. Republicans, who account for most of the concerned voters, are leading the trend, inspired by former President Donald Trump's continued false claims that vote rigging is rampant and the reason he lost the 2020 election.\n\nWidespread voter fraud is rare, and a slew of audits and investigations have confirmed the results of the election four years ago. Even so, election officials across the country have been busy debunking voter fraud conspiracy theories.\n\nSome election administrators have been subject to death threats in the face of public erosion of trust in their work.\n\nPushing false election fraud theories is \"essentially doing our adversaries\u2019 job for them,\" Easterly said. \"And it\u2019s doing a massive disservice to the hundreds of thousands of election officials across the nation because it\u2019s leading to threats of violence and creating real mistrust and stoking partisan discord. That\u2019s exactly what our foreign adversaries want.\"\n\nThe director said the federal agency has worked with local officials to install safety measures at election sites such as panic buttons and bulletproof glass.\n\nEasterly said it's important for Americans to be patient while awaiting the official outcome of the Nov. 5 election.\n\n\"We know that this election is probably going to be very close and elections don\u2019t end when the polls close,\" she said. \"It actually may take days to weeks to actually fully count and audit and certify the vote.\"\n\n\"In that zone of uncertainty,\" she added, \"that\u2019s where our foreign adversaries are going to do their best to influence Americans to undermine our belief in the legitimacy of the process.\u201d",

        "text": "Most U.S. voters say immigrants \u2013 no matter their legal status \u2013 mostly take jobs citizens don\u2019t want\nMajorities of U.S. registered voters say immigrants \u2013 both undocumented and legal \u2013 mostly fill jobs American citizens don\u2019t want, as opposed to jobs citizens would like to have.\n\nThree-quarters of voters say undocumented immigrants fill jobs citizens don\u2019t want, while a lower share (61%) say the same of legal immigrants, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted in August 2024.\n\nThe impact of immigration on the U.S. job market has come up regularly in the 2024 presidential election. Supporters of Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris and her Republican opponent Donald Trump have points of agreement and disagreement on this issue.\n\nHow we did this Pew Research Center conducted this analysis to examine registered voters\u2019 views of the impact of immigration on the U.S. job market ahead of the 2024 presidential election. This analysis is based on a survey of 9,201 adults \u2013 including 7,569 registered voters \u2013 conducted from Aug. 5 to 11, 2024. Everyone who took part is a member of the Center\u2019s American Trends Panel (ATP), a group of people recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses who have agreed to take surveys regularly. This kind of recruitment gives nearly all U.S. adults a chance of selection. Surveys were conducted either online or by telephone with a live interviewer. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other factors. Read more about the ATP\u2019s methodology. Harris supporters are respondents who said they would vote for Kamala Harris, the Democrat, if the 2024 presidential election were held today, or those who said they would not vote for any of the candidates but lean toward Harris. Trump supporters are respondents who said they would vote for Donald Trump, the Republican, if the 2024 presidential election were held today, or those who said they would not vote for any of the candidates but lean toward Trump. Here are the questions used for this analysis, the topline and the survey methodology. Estimates of the U.S. immigrant workforce are based on augmented 2022 American Community Survey data. For workforce estimates, \u201cindustry\u201d refers to the kind of business conducted by an employing organization and \u201coccupation\u201d refers to the kind of work people do on the job. More information on the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s industry and occupation categories can be found here.\n\nNotably, majorities of Harris and Trump supporters say that undocumented immigrants mostly fill jobs that Americans don\u2019t want. Even so, substantial differences exist: 90% of Harris supporters hold this view, compared with 59% of Trump supporters.\n\nLarge shares in both coalitions also say legal immigrants mostly take jobs that U.S. citizens don\u2019t want. Seven-in-ten Harris supporters say this, compared with around half of Trump supporters (52%).\n\nOverall, views have changed little since May 2020, the last time we asked these questions. At that time, 77% of U.S. adults said undocumented immigrants mostly fill jobs that U.S. citizens don\u2019t want, while 64% said the same about legal immigrants. Partisan differences in views have also not changed much since 2020.\n\nViews by race and ethnicity\n\nVoters differ somewhat by race and ethnicity over whether undocumented and legal immigrants take jobs that U.S. citizens don\u2019t want.\n\nNine-in-ten Asian voters say undocumented immigrants mostly fill jobs that American citizens don\u2019t want, as do large majorities of Hispanic (79%), White (75%) and Black (71%) voters.\n\nAmong Harris supporters, majorities across racial and ethnic groups say undocumented immigrants mostly take jobs that citizens don\u2019t want.\n\nBlack Harris supporters are less likely to hold this view. Three-quarters of Black voters who support Harris (75%) say undocumented immigrants mostly fill these jobs, compared with larger shares of Hispanic (93%), White (94%) and Asian (96%) Harris supporters.\n\nThere are insufficient sample sizes to show results by race and ethnicity among Trump supporters in this analysis.\n\nWhen it comes to legal immigrants, 67% of Hispanic voters overall say these immigrants mostly fill jobs that American citizens don\u2019t want, as do smaller shares of White (61%), Asian (57%) and Black (54%) voters.\n\nHarris supporters again differ somewhat by race and ethnicity. Black and Asian voters who support Harris (56% and 58%) are less likely than White and Hispanic Harris supporters (73% and 77%) to say legal immigrants mostly fill jobs that citizens don\u2019t want.\n\nRelated: Trump and Harris Supporters Differ on Mass Deportations but Favor Border Security, High-Skilled Immigration\n\nHow many immigrants are in the U.S. labor force?\n\nOver 30 million immigrants were in the U.S. workforce as of 2022, accounting for 18% of all U.S. workers.\n\nLawful immigrants made up the majority of the immigrant workforce at 22.2 million, representing about 13% of all workers.\n\nAn additional 8.3 million immigrant workers were unauthorized (about 5% of all workers). This is a notable increase over 2019 , but about the same number as in 2007.\n\nRelated: What the data says about immigrants in the U.S.\n\nWhat kinds of jobs do immigrants in the U.S. hold?\n\nBy industry\n\nWhen looking at industries \u2013 the kind of business that employers do \u2013 immigrants accounted for about a quarter of workers (27%) in the agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting sector in 2022. This was followed by construction (26%), according to a Center analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data. There are no major U.S. industries in which immigrants outnumber those born in the country.\n\nThe largest shares of unauthorized immigrant workers were in the construction (13%), agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting (12%), and leisure and hospitality (7%) industries in 2022. Legal immigrant workers accounted for the largest shares in the transportation and utilities (15%) and other services sectors (15%), followed by professional and business services (14%) and agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting sector (14%) \u2013 only slightly above their share of the overall workforce.\n\nBy occupation\n\nWhen looking at occupations \u2013 the kind of work that people do on the job \u2013 immigrants overall accounted for the largest share of workers in farming, fishing and forestry (43%) in 2022, followed by construction and extraction (29%). Immigrants outnumbered U.S.-born workers in some jobs, such as manicurists/pedicurists (73%), taxi drivers (57%) and drywall/ceiling installers (53%).\n\nUnauthorized immigrant workers accounted for the largest shares in occupations such as drywall/ceiling tile installers and tapers (33%), roofers (32%), painters and paperhangers (28%), other agricultural workers (24%), construction laborers (24%), and maids and housekeeping cleaners (24%). Legal immigrant workers accounted for the largest shares in jobs such as manicurists/pedicurists (60%), taxi drivers (44%), interpreters and translators (38%), other life scientists (35%), and physical scientists (34%).\n\nNote: Here are the questions used for this analysis, the topline and the survey methodology.",

        "text": "The U.S. Spies Who Sound the Alarm About Election Interference\nVoters have a limited number of ways to learn about the illicit attempts of foreign powers to manipulate them. One way is for private companies\u2014Microsoft is currently the most active\u2014to publish research about suspicious social-media content or cybercrimes that appear to be state-sponsored. Brandt described such civilian-identified plots as \u201ccaught in the wild.\u201d But private companies can never speak with the authority of the government, and, without subpoenas or spies, they also lack the same breadth of information. Watts, a former F.B.I. special agent, told me that the government is \u201cthe ultimate source of confirmation on attribution and actors.\u201d A deepfake that Microsoft spots \u201cmay be the tip of the iceberg,\u201d he continued, and U.S. intelligence officials \u201ccan understand it at a much deeper level.\u201d Then, there is what he called \u201ca chicken-and-egg problem\u201d facing private companies. The government asks them to shut their platforms to malicious foreign trolls, but the companies \u201care waiting for the state to tell them who those accounts are.\u201d\n\nCriminal prosecutions are another way that covert foreign plots targeting an election can be exposed. Since the appointment of the special counsel Robert Mueller to investigate the Kremlin\u2019s gambit in 2016, federal indictments have consistently provided the most detailed, and therefore potent, accounts of such influence operations. This past summer, news reports about a hacking of the e-mail accounts of Roger Stone, a former Trump adviser, evidently prompted prosecutors in Washington, D.C., to file an indictment against three Iranians. They were charged with dozens of hacking attacks during a five-year period, almost all of them against Americans involved in national security or foreign affairs. The U.S. government had been watching these Iranians for at least four years; the indictment cites evidence that, in each of those years, two of the operatives repeatedly visited a Tehran address linked to the crimes. On June 27, 2024, according to the indictment, the Iranians e-mailed two Biden campaign officials a stolen copy of materials that Trump had used to prepare for that night\u2019s Presidential debate. (The Iranians presciently warned that, if Biden lost the debate, the Democrats \u201cwill have to replace\u201d him.) There\u2019s no evidence, however, that the recipients read the e-mails; Biden flailed in any case. A subsequent attempt to give journalists stolen vetting materials about Trump\u2019s running mate, J. D. Vance, also found no takers. The Times reported its editors had concluded that \u201cpublication was likely to serve the interests of the attackers.\u201d\n\nOther legal findings, also unsealed in September, described a sweeping Russian operation that was years in the making. An affidavit by an F.B.I. investigator quoted notes from meetings held at the Kremlin by a top aide to Putin as early as April, 2022. The aide had hired three Russian contractors to conduct a covert online propaganda campaign to weaken global support for Ukraine\u2019s attempt to repel Russia\u2019s invasion. In 2023, one of the contractors submitted a more detailed proposal, called the Good Old U.S.A. Project, to sway the 2024 election in America. The proposal asserted that an isolationist view of the Ukraine war had become a \u201ccenterpiece\u201d of the Presidential race; Russia must therefore \u201cput a maximum effort to ensure that the Republican point of view (first and foremost the opinion of Trump\u2019s supporters) wins over the U.S. public opinion.\u201d (The names of the parties and candidates were redacted in the filing.) The proposal\u2019s authors saw an opportunity in \u201cthe high level of polarization of American society,\u201d which had created an \u201cinformation situation\u201d that \u201cdiffers dramatically from that in all other Western countries.\u201d\n\nThe Good Old U.S.A. Project envisaged setting up hundreds of fake online accounts, including eighteen seemingly apolitical \u201csleeper\u201d groups on multiple social-media platforms across six swing states; \u201cat the right moment,\u201d they would \u201cdistribute bogus stories disguised as newsworthy events.\u201d (Kremlin documents included in the filing describe Twitter as the most hospitable \u201cmass platform,\u201d although a partially redacted sentence suggests that the Russians liked Trump\u2019s Truth Social even more.) To avoid detection, the Russians planned to disseminate misinformation by inserting comments or replies into authentic message threads; these comments would include links directing users to sites showcasing more elaborate propaganda. The Russians also set out to secretly promote real American influencers who supported \u201cending the war in Ukraine\u201d and were \u201cready to get involved in the promotion of the project narratives.\u201d\n\nIn March, two of the Russian contractors were sanctioned by the Treasury Department for their role in the operation. In July, U.S. prosecutors, after receiving a tip from another government agency, seized nearly a thousand X accounts allegedly tied to a Russian \u201cbot farm\u201d that used A.I. \u201cto create fictitious social media profiles,\u201d evidently as part of the same scheme. Finally, in September, the government shut down thirty-two Web sites that disguised Kremlin propaganda as content from news organizations such as Fox News and the Washington Post. At the same time, prosecutors charged two Russian spies with conspiring to pay ten million dollars to a group of conservative American influencers. Although the unsealed indictment redacted the names, other details indicated that the Russians worked through a Nashville startup called Tenet Media. According to the indictment, in recent months the Russians had posted nearly nine hundred video clips of their own propaganda directly to Tenet social-media feeds. Until the indictment was unsealed, American viewers had no way of knowing that the Kremlin was behind this.\n\nBut U.S. intelligence agencies definitely did, just as they plainly knew about the disguised Web sites. Details from the indictments make clear that federal prosecutors were aware of the underlying schemes for months or longer before informing voters. Of course, educating voters about foreign plots is not the primary responsibility of law enforcement, which moves at its own methodical pace. Subpoenas must be obtained to legally acquire information that other agencies might have learned through spycraft; it takes time to squeeze conspirators to testify against one another, and to lock down conclusive evidence before unsealing charges. Law-enforcement agencies may also want to delay an indictment so that they can arrest suspects before they can flee\u2014although, in the recent election-influence cases, the three Iranians and two Russians indicted were already far out of reach.\n\nProsecutors also work under their own deadlines. Justice Department policy precludes the agency from taking any public actions in the sixty days before an election which might affect the outcome\u2014including filing indictments that expose a foreign adversary\u2019s backing of a candidate. Prosecutors appear to have kept working on the Russia indictments in secrecy as long as they could. They were unsealed on September 4th, on the eve of the sixty-day deadline. Still, Brandt told me that, whatever the timing constraints, the Justice Department can \u201cgo much farther than we can\u201d when releasing information. \u201cThat is how you end up making public multiple internal Russian planning documents, which is something the intelligence community could never release.\u201d\n\nFor voters, the Russia and Iran indictments also raise questions about what else the government knows. Both filings offer keyhole views of major influence operations that surely were not limited to a few inconsequential hacks and to the staff of a small Tennessee media company. Watts, of Microsoft, told me that the government is cracking down on covert Russian influence operations more aggressively than it did before the 2020 election, when there were no such indictments; prosecutors have gone after a \u201csizable chunk of the Russian efforts we have noted.\u201d But he said that law enforcement had not yet taken any visible action against two other Russian online networks that Microsoft had spotted meddling in the election. The company calls those two networks Storm-1516 (which pushed the staged video falsely accusing Harris of a hit-and-run) and Storm-1679 (which pushed a viral video showing a fake New York billboard that hyped false claims about Harris).\n\nRepresentative Jim Himes, of Connecticut, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, told me he was \u201cquite certain\u201d that the foreign corruption of Tenet Media was not an isolated incident: \u201cWe are going to find out there are other cases where some cutout says, \u2018Hey, I\u2019ve got five million dollars for you to promote that Fauci is a Bolshevik,\u2019 or whatever, and the answer is \u2018Yeah, give me that five million!\u2019 \u201d\n\nHearing directly from the U.S. intelligence agencies is the third way Americans can learn about foreign efforts to manipulate our elections. This election season, the Foreign Malign Influence Center has scheduled periodic \u201cupdates\u201d to address the torrent of questions from journalists about such plots. For the spy services, one official told me, this level of public disclosure \u201cis like standing there naked compared to what we have done in the past.\u201d The agencies, always zealous about protecting their sources and methods, prefer to talk as little as possible, and as vaguely as possible. The resulting updates, typically about five hundred words each, are exasperatingly abstract. Speaking as the \u201cintelligence community,\u201d or I.C., an update from early October noted:\n\nA range of foreign actors continue to try to influence U.S. elections as we approach November. These activities include broad efforts aimed at undermining trust in U.S. democratic processes and exacerbating divisions in our society, while also seeking to shape voter preferences toward specific candidates. Our assessments about the activities and goals of Russia, Iran, and China are unchanged from earlier election security updates. On the presidential race, the IC continues to assess that Russia prefers the Former President and Iran prefers the Vice President; China is not seeking to influence the Presidential election.\n\nThe center also holds hour-long conference calls with journalists, but the officials on the calls limit their answers to the contents of the written updates.\n\nThe opacity of such intelligence assessments, whether to journalists or to lawmakers, inevitably opens opportunities for political spin. In 2019, intelligence officials appointed a career spy named Shelby Pierson to the new post of election-threats executive. Her job was to co\u00f6rdinate the analysis of foreign interference or influence operations. After Pierson briefed the bipartisan leaders of the congressional intelligence committees, people on Capitol Hill leaked that she had said the Kremlin once again preferred Trump. The President exploded in anger, tried to get Pierson fired, and attempted to stop the briefings.\n\nShe survived. But Trump then appointed two new directors of National Intelligence, both of whom downplayed the Russian threat. The first was the former ambassador Ric Grenell, who served as temporary acting director. Under Grenell\u2019s tenure, a declassified update provided to the committees declared that the intelligence community \u201chas not concluded\u201d that the Kremlin was aiding either Trump or Biden, \u201cnor have we concluded that the Russians will definitely choose to try to do so in 2020.\u201d\n\nJohn Ratcliffe, a Republican congressman and a former prosecutor, took over as director in May, 2020. He played up supposed intelligence about a major plot by China instead of Russia. Shortly before the election that fall, Ratcliffe was asked in an interview on Fox News whether China opposed Trump. Ratcliffe replied that he could not \u201cget into a whole lot of details\u201d in an unclassified setting, but did say that China was \u201cusing a massive and sophisticated influence campaign that dwarfs anything that any other country is doing.\u201d\n\nDemocrats complained that the Trump appointees were twisting the conclusions of the career analysts, but the classified nature of the reports left no way to settle the dispute. Then, on January 6, 2021, the spy agencies\u2019 \u201canalytic ombudsman\u201d released a report saying that, in the final year of the Trump Administration, intelligence about foreign efforts to influence the election had been \u201cdelayed, distorted, or obstructed\u201d for \u201cpolitical reasons,\u201d and that career analysts viewed some of the public statements issued under Grenell and Ratcliffe as a \u201cgross misrepresentation\u201d of the agencies\u2019 assessments of the Russian and Chinese operations. (Grenell told me that the ombudsman\u2019s report had relied on liberal partisans inside the intelligence agencies; Ratcliffe defended his statements about China as a dissenting view based on his own analysis.) Two months after Biden took office, a declassified version of the agencies\u2019 post-election assessment stated that several arms of the Russian government had, in fact, carried out influence operations \u201csupporting former President Trump\u201d and that the Russians had also been spreading misinformation denigrating Biden for at least six years. A headline in the assessment declared, \u201cChina Did Not Attempt to Influence Presidential Election Outcome.\u201d",

        "text": "Pennsylvania could tip the scales in tough-to-call US presidential election\nThe presidential race hinges on Pennsylvania, a key battleground with 19 electoral votes, where both candidates are heavily investing in a neck-and-neck contest.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPennsylvania, a crucial swing state that could hold the keys to the White House, is getting set for a neck-and-neck contest in the US presidential election.\n\nWith the presidential race in the final stretch, both candidates have become laser-focused on the must-win Pennsylvania, the largest prize of the most important swing states, holding 19 electoral votes.\n\nBoth candidates have become fixtures in America's largest battleground state, investing more money, energy, and visits there than anywhere else in the US.\n\nThe state has sided with the winner of the last two presidential elections by just tens of thousands of votes.\n\n\"Pennsylvania is a state that went for Trump in 2016, went for Biden in 2020,\u201d explained Franklin & Marshall College Director Berwood Yost.\n\n\u201cIt's got large urban centres, rural communities. So Pennsylvania serves as sort of a microcosm of the country as a whole, I think, in many ways,\u201d Yost added.\n\nIt was at a rally in the state in July that Donald Trump survived an assassination attempt after being shot by and wounded in his upper right ear by Thomas Matthew Crooks, a 20-year-old man from Bethel Park.\n\nTrump has since returned to campaigning in the Keystone State, whose power is not lost on the voters themselves.\n\n\"I think it's split pretty evenly right now, half of my friends are, you know, voting for Kamala, and the other half are voting for Trump,\u201d said Brian Neel, a Pennsylvania voter from Chester County. \u201cSo if that's any indication, then, I think it's a pretty tight race here.\"\n\nJodi Eichler-Levine, a voter from Upper Macungie Township, echoed that sentiment.\n\n\"I think that Pennsylvania is such a close state that it's really going to be, you know, literally on Election day, does it rain? Is it sunny? And who's knocking on doors and is most excited about their candidate?\"\n\nHarris is looking to win big in the urban centres of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh\u2014and rack up strong numbers in their suburbs\u2014by driving out the women, black voters, and college graduates that propelled Joe Biden to victory four years ago.\n\nOn the other hand, Donald Trump hopes to expand the Republican support in the rural counties that he carried handily in 2020 and chip away at traditionally democratic voters like Latinos and blue-collar workers.\n\nWhile both sides are claiming the edge in the race for the state, analysts and voters expect every vote to count up until the very end.\n\n\"Both candidates' current voters are equally motivated,\u201d Yost said. \u201cThis is going to come down to which campaign is, I think, better on the ground\u2026That's ultimately going to be what tips the scales here.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSince 1948, no Democrat has won the White House without winning Pennsylvania, which makes the political stakes especially high this time for Harris.\n\nAnd with polls showing the race essentially tied here, once again, Pennsylvania could be the state that tips the US 2024 election.",

        "text": "LaHood, Issa Call for Diplomatic Pressure and Sanctions on Lebanon's Speaker of the Parliament Nabih Berri\nWashington, D.C. \u2013 U.S. Representatives Darin LaHood (R-IL-16) and Darrell Issa (R-CA-48), Co-Chairs of the U.S.-Lebanon Friendship Caucus, sent a letter to President Joe Biden, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen calling on the United States to increase diplomatic pressures, including economic sanctions, on Speaker of the Lebanese Parliament Nabih Berri and those in Lebanon who continue to obstruct the presidential election process and further destabilize the country.\n\n\n\nThe failure to adhere to the Lebanese constitution and hold an open and fair\n\nparliamentary session to elect a president clearly benefited Hezbollah and\n\nthe Iranian regime that calls the shots from the shadows and harms the Lebanese people. LaHood and Issa urged the Administration take a revitalized policy approach toward Lebanon, including renewed diplomatic efforts and effective targeted support through USAID and to the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF).\n\n\n\nIn the letter, LaHood and Issa write in part:\n\nSince October 7, 2023, we have watched Isarel fight against Iranian terror proxies Hamas and Hezbollah, including increasingly significant engagement on the southern border of Lebanon. Hezbollah is today dramatically weakened through the targeting of Hezbollah militants and leadership. As Hezbollah\u2019s grip on Lebanon weakens, and it continues to lose leaders, foot soldiers, infrastructure, financing, and influence, we believe the United States should move forward with direct pressure of Speaker Nabih Berri, Lebanon\u2019s Parliament, and other political leaders to act quickly and hold immediate elections for president. Any continued delay by the Speaker of the Parliament \u2013 or others \u2013 to obstruct the constitution and hold an open and fair parliamentary session to elect a president is unacceptable.\n\nWe believe that electing a president is not ancillary to the current conflict but of central importance to the future of Lebanon. Without a president, and fully operational government, the Lebanese people are denied a national voice and lack a realistic leadership structure to negotiate efforts towards peace on the southern border. This situation has clearly benefited Hezbollah and its terror masters in Tehran that call the shots from the shadows and continue to harm the Lebanese people.\n\n\n\nWe also underscore the necessity of a stronger approach from your Administration. The United States must throw its diplomatic weight behind advancing this reform, including through the Quint, and economically by imposing meaningful sanctions. The U.S. should also be prepared to use all the tools we have to review and freeze the assets \u2013 including dollar denominated and other assets within the United States \u2013 of those who continue to block the electoral process.\n\nOver the last 20 months, Speaker Nabih Berri, has specifically obstructed the electoral process and is clearly not acting in the best interest of Lebanon and its people. He continues to be a main barrier to the opening of Parliament and this and any intentional prevention of a timely presidential election must be viewed for what it is \u2013 exceedingly harmful to Lebanon\u2019s citizens and potential future recovery.\n\nThe full letter can be read HERE.\n\nLaHood and Issa, both of Lebanese descent, have led numerous delegations to Lebanon during their time in Congress. In 2022 and 2023, LaHood and Issa led efforts to urge the United States to push for timely and fair presidential elections in Lebanon.\n\n###",

        "text": "IRI Preliminary Statement on Moldova\u2019s 2024 Presidential Elections & Constitutional Referendum\nChi\u015fin\u0103u, Moldova \u2013 The International Republican Institute\u2019s (IRI) International Election Observation Mission (IEOM) today released its preliminary statement on Moldova\u2019s October 20, 2024, presidential and referendum elections.\n\nThe international delegation, co-led by six-term U.S. Congressman Peter Roskam and former European Union Commissioner and United Nations Deputy Secretary-General Danuta H\u00fcbner, deployed short-term observer (STO) teams across Moldova\u2019s regions. These teams were supported by a core group of thematic experts who have been analyzing the pre-election environment for several weeks and observing the election day process.\n\n\u201cMoldovans demonstrated resilience in the face of unprecedented foreign interference,\u201d said Roskam. \u201cNotwithstanding, Moldova\u2019s institutions are under constant assault from malign actors whose primary aim is to destabilize the country and usurp the will of the Moldovan people. Undeniably, the greatest threat to Moldova\u2019s electoral integrity is malign foreign influence from the Russian Federation.\u201d\n\nH\u00fcbner added, \u201cThough preliminary election results have been declared, efforts to undermine Moldova\u2019s institutions will continue. Moldovans and the democratic community must remain vigilant and stay engaged in reforms that will further consolidate democracy. After all, elections are fundamental for democracy, but democracy cannot survive on elections alone.\u201d\n\nKey Findings:\n\nRussian Interference: There was significant foreign interference, including vote-buying, propaganda, cyberattacks, and provocateurs, particularly targeting the election in Ialoveni raion.\n\nIncreased Voter Turnout: Over 1.5 million Moldovans voted, marking a 10% increase from 2020. Polling stations were well-staffed with notable gender inclusion in leadership roles.\n\nTransparency and Oversight: Strong participation from citizens and international observers ensured a high level of transparency at many polling stations.\n\nCEC\u2019s Strong Performance: The CEC successfully increased polling stations abroad, implemented postal voting, and maintained stations for Moldovan citizens that reside in the Transnistrian region, despite security concerns.\n\nVoter Registry Concerns: Despite efforts to remove invalid voters and to synchronize the State Registry of Voters with other Moldovan government databases, IRI observed that voters and political parties had continued concerns with the potential inclusion of deceased or otherwise inactive voters on the voter list.\n\nElection Integrity Issues: Isolated incidents of carousel voting and vote-buying were observed, raising concerns about the integrity of the election in specific areas.\n\nCampaign Challenges: Reduced visibility of campaign activities, cases of misuse of state resources and illicit financing linked to Russian actors were reported.\n\nRecommendations:\n\nThe Central Election Commission (CEC) in collaboration with the State Register of Population should continue to update and maintain the integrity of the State Registry of Voters (SRV) including establishing a commission of experts to resolve the complex issues of reconciling the voter list, especially concerning Moldovan citizens in diaspora and providing the updated voter list in an analyzable format to ensure independent analysis of its quality.\n\nCounter foreign malign influence by supporting initiatives at the national and local levels, equipping non-governmental and state institutions to confront foreign authoritarian threats to democracy.\n\nExpand postal voting to a larger number of countries, to enable Moldovans abroad to fully participate in the electoral process.\n\nEnsure judicial integrity by holding criminals accountable to the rule of law and empowering authorities to investigate and prosecute foreign actors who attempt to disrupt the campaign and electoral processes.\n\nCombat illicit finance by continuing efforts to address external funding threats and increasing the capacity of institutions to combat them.\n\nExpand the Audiovisual Council\u2019s jurisdiction to cover a wider range of platforms, safeguarding Moldova\u2019s information ecosystem from foreign malign influence.\n\nIRI will continue to monitor the post-election process and issue a final, comprehensive report in the coming weeks, which will include further analysis and recommendations for future elections. IRI remains committed to supporting Moldova\u2019s democratic development and its aspirations for closer European integration.\n\nAbout the Mission:\n\nIRI has led or supported 249 international and citizen election observation missions worldwide and is recognized for its impartiality and professionalism. The organization has been actively working in Moldova for more than 20 years, contributing to the strengthening of democratic institutions and civil society. The IRI 34-person expert delegation for the 2024 Moldovan election is observing all aspects of the electoral process across Moldova, providing a comprehensive analysis of the election process.\n\nThe Moldova mission adheres to the Declaration of Principles for International Election Observation and the Code of Conduct, as adopted by the United Nations in 2005.\n\nThis mission is made possible with the support of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Consortium for Elections and Political Process Strengthening (CEPPS).",

        "text": "Election 2024 recap for Oct. 21: Harris mocks Trump's dancing; Trump jabs Abraham Lincoln\nEditor's note: This page reflects the news from the campaign trail for the2024 election from Monday, Oct. 21. For the latest news on the presidential election, read USA TODAY's live election updates for Tuesday, Oct. 22.\n\nWith just 15 days until Election Day, former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are hitting the battleground states that could determine the race for the White House.\n\nTrump on Monday toured damage from Hurricane Helene in the Asheville, North Carolina, area. He then hosted a rally in Greenville, North Carolina, located in the eastern part of the Tar Heel state. In the early evening, Trump is scheduled to meet with faith leaders near Charlotte.\n\nHarris is making a 3-state swing with former Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., Monday with stops in key suburban counties in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.\n\nThe Republican and Democratic nominees will lay out their plans on the economy, the southern border and other top issues facing the nation as they court voters in these pivotal states, which could be make-or-break in November.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nKeep up with the USA TODAY Network's live election coverage.\n\nHarris mocks Trump\u2019s dancing, suggests he\u2019s 'hiding' a condition\n\nVice President Kamala Harris sought to turn the tables on former President Donald Trump at a Monday evening event, where she questioned his mental soundness and suggested he and his staff are hiding something.\n\nTrump and his allies have accused Harris of participating in a cover-up since President Joe Biden, 81, struggled to get his points across at a June presidential debate. Harris has, in turn, questioned why Trump has not released his medical records and backed out of interviews.\n\n\"I wonder what is he hiding. I also wonder what his staff is trying to hide by preventing or suggesting he not debate me again, not do these interviews,\" Harris told conservative commentator Charlie Sykes on Monday during a moderated conversation in Wisconsin.\n\nThe jab came amid a sharpened pitch from Harris, 60, that Trump, 78, is unstable and unfit for the presidency.\n\nAt the event in Waukesha County with former Republican Rep. Liz Cheney, Harris also mocked Trump\u2019s lengthy dancing at a town hall event this month.\n\n\"Would it be called just a solo dance?\" she asked. Cheney said, \"Dance is really generous.\"\n\n\u2014 Francesca Chambers\n\nTrump (again) throws shade at Abraham Lincoln\n\nLess than a week after questioning President Abraham Lincoln's leadership for not settling the Civil War, Trump again hit Honest Abe on Monday - over border issues.\n\nIn what may have been a joke, Trump also managed to mock President George Washington while discussing the endorsement of a border patrol union during a rally in Greenville, N.C.\n\nA union official supposedly said \"I'm the greatest president there's ever been,\" according to Trump. \"I said, 'what about George Washington?' ... Nah, you're better ... 'What about Lincoln? What about Abraham Lincoln?' ... Nope, you're better.\"\n\n\"He said I'm tougher on the border than Abraham Lincoln, right, than Honest Abe.\"\n\nPerhaps he was referring to the Confederate army's incursions into Maryland and Pennsylvania (where it met defeat at Antietam and Gettysburg). Who knows?\n\n- David Jackson\n\n'Not eating gummies': Harris on coping with anxiety on the campaign trail\n\nDemocratic nominee Kamala Harris on Monday said she's certainly not using one potential wellness technique to deal with anxiety during her presidential campaign: edible marijuana.\n\nThe topic came up during a town hall style exchange in Royal Oak, Michigan, between Harris and journalist Maria Shriver.\n\n\u201cEverybody I talk to says you know, I have to turn off the news I can\u2019t read anything, I\u2019m mediating, I\u2019m doing yoga. I\u2019m so anxious . . . I\u2019m eating gummies. All kinds of things. What are you doing?\u201d Shriver asked.\n\nHarris, the incumbent Democratic vice president, replied, \"Not eating gummies.\"\n\n\"Okay! We got that clear!\" Shriver said in response.\n\nElaborating on her efforts to stay healthy, Harris said she's working out daily, but added: \u201cI wake up in the middle of the night usually these days, just to be honest with you.\u201d\n\n- Darren Samuelsohn and Karissa Waddick\n\nTrump touts his odds in betting markets\n\nDonald Trump has his eye on the gambling lines.\n\nTrump told supporters at a rally in Concord, North Carolina that he\u2019s doing \u201creally well\u201d against Kamala Harris and pointed to political betting markets as proof.\n\n\u201cI know nobody in this room gambles, but some of the gambling polls are really at that like 65 to 35 or something like that,\u201d Trump said.\n\nOverseas bettors on sites like the crypto trading platform Polymarket are predicting that Trump will win the election by a wide margin against Harris.\n\n\u201cDoes anybody in this room gamble? No, no, no great Christians don't gamble, do they?\u201d Trump said.\n\nTraditional polls, meanwhile, show Trump and Harris locked in a close race. The latest USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll found Harris at at 45% and Trump at 44% nationally.\n\n- Karissa Waddick\n\nCrude talk and the NFL: Trump doubles down on his lead with male voters\n\nDonald Trump, who is leading in the polls with male voters, over the weekend referenced a golfing legend's manhood, interspersed his speeches with curse words and attended an NFL game to ensure he holds onto that key constituency.\n\nIt's a strategy that involves doubling down on exciting the Republican presidential nominee's most ardent supporters and emphasizing turnout among low propensity male voters with a hyper-masculine style, one his critics call a corrosive version of masculinity. Meanwhile, he is barely nodding at - and may be alienating - the suburban women swing voters once considered key campaign targets.\n\nStill, Trump's approach has him competitive in the polls \u2212 neck-and-neck with Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris \u2013 and it's one he\u2019s long employed, even if it\u2019s unusual for most politicians.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anyone focus more strenuously on current supporters rather than trying to expand the pool of potential voters,\u201d said Frank Luntz, a GOP pollster and frequent Fox News contributor with more than three decades of political experience.\n\nCheck out the full report here on Trump's efforts to double down with male voters.\n\n- Zac Anderson\n\nTrump blames the media for questions about 'cognitive decline'\n\nAll that odd Trump behavior in recent days?\n\nThe former president blames the media, denouncing its \"level of meanness.\"\n\nAt a rally in Greenville, N.C., Trump did not discuss incidents in the past week, including a 40-minute music-and-dance-a-thon after a truncated town hall in Oaks, Pa., his use of profanity at Catholic charity dinner in New York City, and his locker room tribute to the physical attributes of legendary golfer Arnold Palmer in his hometown of Latrobe, Pa.\n\nIn Trump's telling, the stories are all about him misusing words.\n\n\"All these idiots back there will say 'he's cognitively impaired,'\" Trump told supporters, referring to the press pen. \"'Oh, I heard a word that wasn't exactly proper. He's cognitive.' They're sick people.\"\n\nTrump did pull back to say it wasn't every reporter - \"not all of them ... I'd say 92%.\"\n\n- David Jackson\n\nPro-Trump group behind ads lying about Harris' positions on guns and fracking\n\nA pro-Trump group is secretly behind a website, texts and ads in swing states that lie about Democratic nominee Kamala Harris' positions on a range of topics.\n\nThe connection between the website and political non-profit organization named \"Building America's Future,\" which has connections to several prominent Republicans backing Republican nominee Donald Trump in 2024 was first reported by campaign spending and government transparency organization Open Secrets.\n\nBilled as Progress 2028, the site purports to be Kamala Harris\u2019 liberal counter to the conservative Heritage Foundation\u2019s Project 2025, a guide of proposals for a second Trump term that has drawn scrutiny and outrage from the left.\n\nThe policies listed on the Progress 2028 website include disproven and misleading claims about Harris\u2019 positions. Policies listed include providing Medicaid to immigrants here illegally, banning fracking for natural gas and a mandatory gun buy back program.\n\nWhile the website is bare bones, the group has spread the information through text messages and nearly $191,769 in Facebook and Instagram ads targeted at voters in North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Georgia and Michigan\n\nBuilding America's Future filed its fictitious name \"Project 2028\" in Virginia back in September. The website was created three days later.\n\nAs a political nonprofit, Building America\u2019s Future is not legally required to report its finances until after Election Day. By law, it is not required to disclose its donors.\n\n-Sarah D. Wire\n\nHarris hits the suburbs with former GOP Rep. Liz Cheney\n\nVice President Kamala Harris began a three-state swing on Monday that focuses on anti-Trump Republicans and suburban women in Chester County, Pennsylvania, with former GOP Rep. Liz Cheney at her side.\n\nPresident Joe Biden won the Philadelphia suburb four years ago, and former GOP presidential candidate Nikki Haley performed well there during the Republican primary contest in April, which was held after she'd already ended her campaign.\n\nCheney emphasized at the event that she is a conservative and a lifelong Republican.\n\n\"You have to choose in this race between someone who has been faithful to the Constitution, who will be faithful, and Donald Trump,\" Cheney said, bringing up the Jan. 6 insurrection and the former president's efforts to overturn the results of the last election.\n\nHarris and Cheney, who previously endorsed Harris, participated in a moderated conversation with Republican strategist Sarah Longwell, a prominent Trump critic, in Malvern, taking questions on issues such as child care, elder care and maternal health. They'll be in Michigan and Wisconsin later in the day.\n\n\u2212 Francesca Chambers\n\nTrump tours storm damage in N.C.; urges supporters to get out and vote\n\nTraveling Monday to western North Carolina, Trump combined a disaster recovery tour with a get-out-the-vote plea to supporters.\n\nTrump also pledged to help North Carolinians with hurricane recovery - \"if\" he wins the election.\n\n\"We have to vote,\" Trump told reporters at the top of remarks in Asheville, N.C., saying his supporters need to find ways to cast ballots despite the massive damage to the area wrought by Hurricane Helene. \"They have to get out and vote.\"\n\nTrump said aides would prefer him say he would do things \"when\" he regains the presidency, but he feels better saying \"if\" because \"you never want to take something like that for granted.\"\n\nThen he mentioned turnout.\n\nNorth Carolina, which Trump carried in 2016 and 2020, is probably an essential state for him in 2024; polls show a close race with Harris in the Tar Heel state.\n\nThe former president has two more events Monday in North Carolina.\n\n\u2212David Jackson\n\nWalz questions if misstatements are 'important', calls Trump a 'pathological liar' on 'The View'\n\nDemocratic vice presidential candidate Tim Walz made his debut appearance on ABC's \"The View\" Monday morning and defended his long history of misstatements and gaffes, arguing there is a stark difference between him and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.\n\nCo-host Alyssa Farrah, and former Trump White House assistant and director of strategic communications, questioned Walz on his trustworthiness as his short time on the campaign trail has and produced a number of inconsistencies and exaggerations.\n\n\"I think people do separate (misspeaking about when he was in China) between a pathological liar, like Donald Trump, they get it out there. But I do think it's important that we're careful about how we speak,\" Walz said.\n\nThe former educator has largely chalked up his inaccuracies, like saying he was present for the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests when he wasn't, to speaking off-the-cuff and his lack of political polishing.\n\n\"I think being a teacher, being a coach, I just speak from my heart,\" he said.\n\nHe added: \"I think the public sees this, just the massive amount of misinformation that gets poured out there, (are the misspeaks) important to be detailed?\" he said as he abruptly ended the response.\n\n\u2212 Sam Woodward\n\nWalz suggests Republicans for possible Harris Cabinet contenders on 'SmartLess' podcast\n\nDemocratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz during a Monday podcast interview endorsed Kamala Harris' pledge to appoint a Republican Cabinet member if elected.\n\n\u201cWell, she said, and I agree with her, she needs to appoint a Republican to the Cabinet,\u201d he said on the \"SmartLess\" podcast, hosted by comedians Jason Bateman, Sean Hayes and Will Arnett. \u201cTo a position of authority, there\u2019s a lot of them out there. These folks who are coming out and speaking on behalf of these Republicans, I disagree with many of them, but their values are there.\"\n\nHe even named some names, applauding conservative figures known to reach across the aisle such as former Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., and Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla.,\n\nHe added: \"Some of these people need to be put in a position where they truly have the ability to influence things because they are ethical and they care about this country and I think that\u2019s something that really sets (Harris) apart to make a high profile appointment to the Cabinet.\u201d\n\nPodcast co-host and actor Jason Bateman interjected, \"or two, or three?\"\n\n\"Yes! Bring 'em,\" Walz agreed.\n\n\u2013 Sam Woodward\n\nFollowing Election 2024? Sign up for USA TODAY's On Politics newsletter for breaking news and exclusive analysis.\n\nSupreme Court ends Michael Cohen's attempt to sue Donald Trump and other federal officials\n\nThe Supreme Court on Monday put an end to Michael Cohen\u2019s attempt to sue Donald Trump for being abruptly sent back to prison in 2020 as retaliation for writing a tell-all book about him.\n\nThe justices rejected Cohen\u2019s appeal of a lower court\u2019s dismissal of his suit. Cohen said Trump and others tried to silence him by revoking his home release and putting him in solitary confinement. Cohen, who had served as Trump's loyal personal attorney and fixer, was serving a three-year sentence after pleading guilty to coordinating payoffs to buy the silence of women who said they had sexual affairs with Trump before he was elected.\n\nA federal judge ordered Cohen released back to his family, saying his return to prison had been in retaliation for his criticism of Trump. But when Cohen also sought damages from Trump, Attorney General William Barr and from prisons officials, another federal judge said Supreme Court precedents prevented the suit.\n\n\u2013 Maureen Groppe\n\nCBS\u2019 '60 Minutes' rejects accusation Harris interview was deceptively edited\n\nCBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d which recently held its traditional pre-election interview with Kamala Harris, rejected accusations from Donald Trump and his allies that it deceptively edited a clip of the conversation.\n\nTrump's campaign has alleged that CBS edited different responses for different shows on the network, including \"60 Minutes\" and \"Face the Nation.\"\n\nHowever, the longtime news program said in a statement this week that: \u201c60 Minutes gave an excerpt of our interview to Face the Nation that used a longer section of her answer than that on 60 Minutes. Same question. Same answer. But a different portion of the response,\u201d the network explained in a statement.\n\n\u201cWhen we edit any interview, whether a politician, an athlete, or movie star, we strive to be clear, accurate and on point. The portion of her answer on 60 Minutes was more succinct, which allows time for other subjects in a wide ranging 21-minute-long segment,\u201d they added.\n\nTrump declined to participate in an interview with \u201c60 Minutes\u201d ahead of Election Day.\n\n\u2212 Sudiksha Kochi\n\nHarris and Trump tied in USA TODAY poll amid battle for Black and Latino voters\n\nAn exclusive USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll found that among 1,000 likely voters, Harris has earned 45% of support, while Trump has earned 44%, a closer race than the poll found in August. Then, in the wake of the Democratic National Convention, Vice President Harris led the former president by five percentage points, 48% to 43%.\n\nHarris has also lost ground among Latino voters, who now support Trump by 49% to 38%, and among Black voters. They favor Harris by 72% to 17%, a 55-point advantage that is well below where Democrats traditionally fare.\n\nTrump has made a concerted bid for the votes of Hispanic and Black voters, especially men, focusing on issues of the economy and crime. His success at eroding the Democrats' typical advantage has raised alarm in Harris' camp and a rebuke on the stump from former President Barack Obama of Black men, who he said might be reluctant to vote for a woman.\n\n\u2212 Sudiksha Kochi, Susan Page and Maya Marchell Hoff\n\nWhen will the election results be announced?\n\nIt is not clear exactly when the election results will be announced, as the timing depends on a variety of factors. Each state handles its elections differently, ranging from weeks-long early voting to strict voter ID laws.\n\nBut you can anticipate delays.\n\nSome key swing states that Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are vying for, like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, aren't permitted to start processing absentee and mail-in ballots until Election Day, which is expected to slow down the count.\n\n-- Sudiksha Kochi and Sam Woodward\n\nWhen can you vote for the president?\n\nThere are several ways you can vote in the general election. Depending on where you live, you can vote early either by mail or in person. You can also wait to go to a polling location on Nov. 5, which is Election Day, to cast your ballot.\n\nUSA TODAY has a breakdown of when early voting has started or will begin in the states. The first state in the country to begin voting was Alabama, which sent around absentee ballots on Sept. 11. Alabama does not have an option for in-person early voting.\n\nSeven states are expected to open up options for in-person early voting or in-person absentee early voting on Monday, including Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Idaho, South Carolina and Texas.\n\n-- Sudiksha Kochi and Fernando Cervantes Jr.\n\nElon Musk's $1 million reward plan raises questions about election interference\n\nElon Musk's pledge to give away $1 million to a person who signed his online petition every day until Election Day is raising some concerns from some election law experts, who say it may be election interference.\n\nMusk, the world's richest person, announced the lottery at a Donald Trump rally on Saturday in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, as he handed out the first $1 million check to an attendee named John Dreher.\n\n\"The only thing that we ask for the million dollars is that you be a spokesperson for the petition,\" Musk said as Dreher held up a cardboard cutout of the million-dollar check.\n\nGiving out a reward to people for casting a vote or registering to vote is a federal crime that could incur prison time, legal experts say.\n\n\"Making a million dollar prize contingent on registering to vote is illegal,\" Rick Hasen, an election law expert and the director of the Safeguarding Democracy Project, wrote in a widely-viewed post to X on Saturday. \"Also, with PA registration soon closing for this election it may not accomplish what Musk wants.\"\n\nIn an interview on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro called the giveaways \"deeply concerning.\"\n\n\"When you start flowing this kind of money into politics, I think it raises serious questions,\" he said.\n\n\"It's something that law enforcement could take a look at,\" he added.\n\n-- Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nIs Election Day a federal holiday?\n\nElection Day, Nov. 5, is not a federal holiday.\n\nBut some states observe it as a holiday, closing state offices on the date, including New York, Virginia, Maryland, Illinois, Indiana, and at least eight others.\n\nThe District of Columbia and 24 states offer workers paid time off to cast their ballot. Some other states, including Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Massachusetts and Wisconsin, offer time off to vote, but without pay guaranteed.\n\n-- Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nWhere do Harris and Trump stand in the polls?\n\nAs the 2024 presidential race heads into the homestretch, the latest Real Clear Politics polling average shows a tight contest between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. As of Sunday afternoon, Harris leads Trump by 0.9 percentage points in the national polling average.\n\nIn key battleground states, Trump holds narrow leads. He\u2019s up by 0.7 percentage points in averages of Pennsylvania polls, 1.2 in Michigan averages and 0.2 in Wisconsin. These swing states are expected to play a pivotal role in determining the outcome next month\n\n\u2013 Jeremy Yurow\n\nWhere is Harris campaigning?\n\nKamala Harris will be in Wisconsin Monday, campaigning alongside former Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo, one of Donald Trump's most vocal critics.\n\nThe pair plans to appear together in a series of three \u201cmoderated conversations\u201d in suburban swing state communities, according to the Harris campaign.\n\nBeginning in Chester County, Pennsylvania, west of Philadelphia, Harris and Cheney will then make stops in Waukesha County, Wisconsin, west of Milwaukee, and Oakland County, Michigan, northwest of Detroit.\n\nCheney joined Harris on the campaign trail this month, after endorsing the vice president in September.\n\n\u2013 Savannah Kuchar\n\nWhere is Trump campaigning?\n\nTrump kicks off a southern swing early this week, beginning with appearances across North Carolina on Monday.\n\nThe former president plans to visit Asheville and give remarks from the Appalachian city hard hit by Hurricane Helene.\n\nAlso in the Tar Heel State, Trump will hold a rally in Greenville Monday afternoon and an event in Concord with faith leaders, his son Eric Trump and former U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson.\n\n\u2013 Savannah Kuchar",

        "text": "Mideast conflict looms over US presidential race as Harris and Trump jostle for an edge\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Two weeks out from Election Day, the crisis in the Middle East is looming over the race for the White House, with one candidate struggling to find just the right words to navigate its difficult cross-currents and the other making bold pronouncements that the age-old conflict can quickly be set right.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has been painstakingly \u2014 and not always successfully \u2014 trying to balance talk of strong support for Israel with harsh condemnations of civilian casualties among Palestinians and others caught up in Israel\u2019s wars against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, for his part, insists that none of this would have happened on his watch and that he can make it all go away if elected.\n\nBoth of them are bidding for the votes of Arab and Muslim American voters and Jewish voters, particularly in extremely tight races in the battleground states of Michigan and Pennsylvania.\n\nHarris over the weekend alternately drew praise and criticism over her comments about a pro-Palestinian protester that were captured on a widely shared video. Some took Harris\u2019 remark that the protester\u2019s concerns were \u201creal\u201d to be an expression of agreement with his description of Israel\u2019s conduct as \u201cgenocide.\u201d That drew sharp condemnation from Israel\u2019s former ambassador to the U.S., Michael Oren.\n\nBut Harris\u2019 campaign said that while the vice president was agreeing more generally about the plight of civilians in Gaza, she was not and would not accuse Israel of genocide.\n\nWhat to know about Trump\u2019s second term:\n\nStaffing the administration: Here are the people Trump has picked recess appointments Follow all of our coverage as Donald Trump assembles his second administration.\n\nA day earlier, the dynamics were reversed when Harris told reporters that the \u201cfirst and most tragic story\u201d of the conflict was the Oct. 7 Hamas attack last year that killed about 1,200 Israelis. That was triggering to those who feel she is not giving proper weight to the deaths of the more than 41,000 Palestinians who have been killed in Gaza.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, in recent days has participated in interviews with Saudi-owned Al-Arabiya and Lebanese outlet MTV, where he promised to bring about peace and said \u201cthings will turn out very well\u201d in Lebanon.\n\nIn a post on his social media platform Monday, he predicted a Harris presidency would only make matters in the Mideast worse.\n\n\u201cIf Kamala gets four more years, the Middle East will spend the next four decades going up in flames, and your kids will be going off to War, maybe even a Third World War, something that will never happen with President Donald J. Trump in charge,\u201d Trump posted. \u201cFor our Country\u2019s sake, and for your kids, Vote Trump for PEACE!\u201d\n\nHarris\u2019 position is particularly awkward because as vice president she is tethered to President Joe Biden\u2019s foreign policy decisions even as she\u2019s tried to strike a more empathetic tone to all parties. But Harris aides and allies also are frustrated with what they see as Trump largely getting a pass on some of his unpredictable foreign policy statements.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the very thoughtful, very careful school versus the showboat,\u201d said James Zogby, founder and president of the Arab American Institute, who has endorsed Harris. \u201cThat does become a handicap in these late stages when he\u2019s making all these overtures. When the bill comes due they\u2019re going to walk away empty-handed, but by then it\u2019ll be too late.\u201d\n\nThe political divisions on the campaign trail augur potentially significant implications after Election Day as powers in the region, particularly Israel\u2019s Benjamin Netanyahu, closely eye the outcome and the potential for any shifts to U.S. foreign policy.\n\nA new AP-NORC poll finds that neither Trump nor Harris has a clear political advantage on the situation in the Middle East. About 4 in 10 registered voters say Trump would do a better job, and a similar share say that about Harris. Roughly 2 in 10 say neither candidate would do a better job.\n\nThere are some signs of weakness on the issue for Harris within her own party, however. Only about two-thirds of Democratic voters say Harris would be the better candidate to handle the situation in the Middle East. Among Republicans, about 8 in 10 say Trump would be better.\n\nIn Michigan, which has the nation\u2019s largest concentration of Arab Americans, the Israel-Hamas war has profound and personal impacts on the community. In addition to many community members having family in both Lebanon and Gaza, Kamel Ahmad Jawad, a metro Detroit resident, was killed while trying to deliver aid to his hometown in southern Lebanon.\n\nThe war\u2019s direct impact on the community has fueled outrage and calls for the U.S. to demand an unconditional cease-fire and impose a weapons embargo on Israel.\n\nAlthough both parties have largely supported Israel, much of the outrage and blame has been directed at Biden. When Harris entered the race, many Arab American leaders initially felt a renewed sense of optimism, citing her past comments and the early outreach efforts of her campaign.\n\nHowever, that optimism quickly faded as the community perceived that she had not sufficiently distanced her policies from those of Biden.\n\n\u201cTo say to Arab Americans, \u2018Trump is going to be worse\u2019 \u2014 what is worse than having members of your family killed?\u201d said Rima Meroueh, director of the National Network for Arab American Communities. \u201cThat\u2019s what people are saying when they\u2019re asked the question, \u2018Isn\u2019t Trump going to be worse?\u2019 It can\u2019t be worse than what\u2019s happening to us right now.\u201d\n\nFuture Coalition PAC, a super PAC backed by billionaire Elon Musk, is running ads in Arab American communities in Michigan focused on Harris\u2019 support for Israel, complete with a photo of her and her husband, Doug Emhoff, who is Jewish. The same group is sending the opposite message to Jewish voters in Pennsylvania, attacking her support for the withholding of some weapons from Israel \u2014 a Biden administration move to pressure the longtime U.S. ally to limit civilian casualties.\n\nHarris spokesperson Morgan Finkelstein cast Trump\u2019s approach toward the Middle East as part of a broader sign that \u201can unchecked, unhinged Trump is simply too dangerous \u2014 he would bring us right back to the chaotic, go-it-alone approach that made the world less safe and he would weaken America.\u201d\n\n___\n\nCappelletti reported from Lansing, Michigan.

        "text": "Saint Michael\u2019s College visiting speaker makes case for voting as a duty\nVoting may not be a legal requirement in the U.S., but it\u2019s certainly a moral obligation for citizens \u2013 at least that\u2019s what visiting speaker and Political Science Professor Julia Maskivker says.\n\nMaskivker, a professor at Rollins College in Florida, spoke to a full room of Saint Michael\u2019s students, faculty, staff, and other community members recently as part of a voter awareness series on campus. The series has approached the topics of voting and citizenship from a number of different perspectives throughout the fall semester in the lead-up to the U.S. Presidential election in November.\n\nMaskivker, who described herself as a Latin American immigrant from Argentina, said she had been surprised upon moving to the U.S. that voting is not a requirement. In Argentina, like in many Latin American countries, voting is compulsory, she said.\n\n\u201cYou have to show up at the polls absent some valid justification, such as you were sick or too far away from the polls,\u201d Maskivker said. \u201cWhen I came to this country to start my graduate studies, I realized that elections here are more complicated. Political parties have to worry about convincing people to vote \u2013 not just telling them who to vote for.\u201d\n\nThis new understanding inspired Maskivker to examine the concept of voting further, leading to many published articles and a book titled, \u201cThe Duty to Vote.\u201d Her book formed the basis for her talk at Saint Michael\u2019s College on Oct. 14.\n\nMaskivker incorporated political theory and philosophy into her talk to make the case that voting is a moral duty and that being an informed voter matters.\n\n\u201cI argue that we have duties of Samaritan justice to relieve society of the harms, suffering and pains caused to citizens by bad governance \u2013 by rulers that govern unjustly, cruelly, non-responsibly, or inefficiently,\u201d Maskivker said. \u201cWe have duties to relieve our fellow citizens of the suffering that those actions cause.\u201d\n\nPeople who don\u2019t vote cause just as much harm as uninformed or apathetic voters, Maskivker said, because they are failing to act in a way that will prevent harm to others. She pointed out that many voters feel like their votes don\u2019t make a difference because their single vote gets lost in a \u201cproverbial ocean of votes.\u201d However, she countered that collective action \u2013 or joining forces with others toward a common good \u2013 was still a way individuals\u2019 votes could have an impact.\n\n\u201cNot everything we do in life is individually rational,\u201d Maskivker said. \u201cSome things are collectively rational.\u201d\n\nShe listed several examples, adding, \u201cWe recycle, and we know that our plastic bottle down in the blue bin will not be the one responsible for solving the climate crisis. We donate to charity, and we know that our single donation will not end global poverty. We volunteer our time to find a cure to cancer, and we know it\u2019s not our five minutes or half an hour doing this that will determine whether cancer is curable or not. People do these things all the time, but they know that many others doing the same thing has an impact.\u201d\n\nWhile the institutional design of the U.S. electoral system (including the two-party system and the Electoral College) presents challenges to some of Maskivker\u2019s points, she said the underlying moral obligation to vote remains constant for all who live in democracies.\n\n\u201cThe problem is structural \u2013 it\u2019s in the rules,\u201d Maskivker said of the U.S. electoral system. \u201cIt\u2019s not in democracy.\u201d",

        "text": "Housing Takes Center Stage in the Presidential Election\nEvery presidential election cycle, those who work on housing issues (\u201chousers\u201d) watch the policy debate hoping that the nation\u2019s housing challenges get some attention from those in the race. For decades those hopes have been dashed as housing has barely received a mention. But this year housing has not only made an appearance on the political stage, it has taken a leading role. In this election, housing affordability has emerged as a critical issue not just for the country\u2019s poorest households or those on the expensive coasts but for those solidly in the middle class and in the heartland. Renters across a broad spectrum are struggling to find apartments that don\u2019t require an excessive share of their monthly income, while would-be homebuyers are increasingly priced out, if they can even find an available home in today\u2019s historically tight market.\n\nSo what are the candidates proposing to address these issues? Vice President Kamala Harris has formulated a fairly detailed housing plan that both seeks to stimulate greater production of affordable homes and help households afford to buy one. On the supply side, she has proposed expanding the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program (LIHTC), which has been the principal source of new affordable rentals since 1986. Harris has also proposed tax incentives for homebuilders to produce more entry-level homes, as well as a tax credit to support the construction and rehabilitation of homes for sale in distressed communities where these investments don\u2019t pencil out. The plan also includes financial incentives for state and local governments to streamline restrictive regulations that currently limit housing production and support innovative means of developing homes.\n\nThe campaign asserts that these initiatives would enable the construction of three million new homes over four years. That goal is certainly ambitious; it would represent a roughly 50 percent increase in housing production over the current rate. But while the target may be difficult to achieve, the emphasis on efforts to expand the housing supply\u2014particularly of affordable rentals and entry-level homes\u2014represents a sea change in the federal approach to housing assistance that has largely focused on demand-side help in recent decades.\n\nIn fact, the Harris plan includes a substantial new program that would provide $25,000 in downpayment assistance to four million first-time homebuyers over the next four years. This proposal has raised concerns that it would spur inflation in a tight housing market. However, this concern would be mitigated if the supply-side initiatives are quickly implemented and successful. And given the stark racial differences in wealth in the US, failing to address this critical demand-side constraint would unfairly leave millions on the sidelines. Given the massive cost of supporting so many homebuyers, a smaller scale and more targeted program would be more likely to get passed by congress, less likely to be inflationary, and give more time for supply-side efforts to bear fruit.\n\nFinally, the Harris plan calls for efforts to rein in investors in single-family rentals who may compete with first-time buyers. Her proposal would limit tax breaks available to investors and would curtail coordinated efforts by large property owners to share data to set rents. It is difficult to gauge how effective these approaches would be. Single-family rentals play an important role in expanding choice for renters and the national share of single-family homes for rent is not particularly elevated relative to historic standards, although the shares are high in selected markets in the South and West. Cracking down on firms that aggregate rental data to help owners set rents is also unlikely to turn back the clock on what is now a far more sophisticated industry with respect to mining data to assess market conditions.\n\nThe Trump campaign has also consistently highlighted housing affordability, although it has not released any detailed policy proposals, so the specifics of their approach are not known. The Republican platform simply calls for the limited use of federal land for housing construction, tax incentives for first-time homebuyers, and efforts to cut unnecessary regulations that raise housing costs. Former President Donald Trump\u2019s principal talking point on the campaign trail has been that immigrants are a chief cause of housing inflation and that efforts to curb immigration and deport millions of immigrants will bring housing costs under control. Notwithstanding the substantial personal suffering and economic toll that massive deportation would entail, the argument that immigrants are behind the recent housing cost rise has been rebutted by numerous economists who note that there is only a small correlation between house prices, rents, and levels of immigration. Immigrants are also an important source of labor to help expand the supply of homes.\n\nHaving made it to the political stage, the question is whether housing will see greater action by the federal government once the dust settles on the election. Given the specifics of the Harris plan in my view there would be more hope of progress in a Harris administration. But most of her agenda will require congressional action and bipartisan legislation, which has been rare in these hyper-partisan times. Still, many of these proposals have strong support from both parties, building as they often do on existing proposed legislation. And the groundswell of public opinion that has brought housing to center stage is not going away, as home prices and rents continue to stay near record levels. Housers will be eager to see how this drama unfolds, keeping hope alive that there will be meaningful action to address our country\u2019s significant need for decent, affordable homes.\n\nChris Herbert is the managing director of the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University.",

        "text": "What to expect on Election Day, according to Brown's faculty experts\nOn the historical significance of the 2024 election\n\nSchiller: If elected, it is highly likely that Trump will govern in a more authoritarian fashion than any president in modern times, and he will try to disregard the rule of law, especially given that the current Supreme Court has given presidents immunity for actions taken while president. We will have to see how Americans react to the changes that would come in every corner of our democracy.\n\nTobin-Tyler: This election could not be more important for the future of women\u2019s rights. The differences in the visions for the future of the country, and interpretation of the past, of the two campaigns are stark. The ideology represented by the Trump-Vance campaign envisions a return to a time when women\u2019s roles were more circumscribed and they were expected to sacrifice their freedoms and economic independence to fulfill their role as mothers. Parts of the religious right are attacking not only access to abortion, but also access to contraception as a way to reign in what some see as too much sexual freedom for women. This vision has been reinforced by the conservative majority of the Supreme Court, which insists that the Constitution should be interpreted through the lens of \u201chistory and tradition\u201d and the original public meaning at the time of the country\u2019s founding, a time when women essentially had no rights. In recent cases, it has also signaled its willingness to privilege religious rights over the rights of women and gender minorities.\n\nReflective of this \u201ctake the country back\u201d vision is an unwillingness to acknowledge the very real challenges faced by women in 2024: No federally mandated paid family leave, unaffordable and often low-quality childcare, a stubborn pay gap, and a growing maternal health crisis, exacerbated by inaccessible reproductive health care for many women, especially low-income women and women of color.\n\nThe Harris campaign represents a completely different vision of women\u2019s roles and rights. If she wins, as the first woman president she will exemplify what it means for women to have equal access to power. Her record as vice president and her choice of Tim Walz, who as governor of Minnesota successfully passed paid leave and childcare legislation, also demonstrates her vision of what policies she believes can help to provide an even playing field for women.\n\nOn how the economy will affect voters\u2019 decisions\n\nBlyth: If we are talking about the broad mass of voters whose votes will absolutely not determine the election \u2014 say Democratic voters in Massachusetts or Republican voters in Montana \u2014 then the cost of living, especially the cost of housing, is a key issue. Unfortunately, there is very little either candidate can do about these factors in the short to medium run (build many more houses, break up concentrated markets) and one of them seems to have little interest in either solution, focusing instead on China and immigration as key themes. In terms of the less than 1% of the population that will decide the election? That\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess. Housing or immigration? Take your pick. And if the Middle East turmoil worsens and that affects gas prices, that adds more uncertainty into the mix.\n\nOn the role of race\n\nTate: Trump has made race an issue in this campaign. He accused Harris of only recently claiming to be Black. He has falsely accused Haitian immigrants of eating family pets. He said he would change Fort Liberty\u2019s name back to its former Confederate name, Fort Bragg. He has pledged to end DEI programs in the military and in federal offices. He has also attacked Harris\u2019 gender, calling her dumb. Harris has reacted by avoiding any discussion of her race and gender. She generally has not commented on the historic nature of this election, and the fact that she could become the nation\u2019s first Black South Asian female president. When asked directly about Trump\u2019s comment about her racial identity, she refused to answer, saying \u201cnext question.\u201d\n\nBy injecting race into the campaign, Trump is appealing to his base of racially conservative white voters. Political scientists have found that whites who believe that Blacks don\u2019t try hard enough and want special favors (about 40% of the white population) greatly preferred Trump over Clinton in 2016, and that whites who believe the same things about Latinos (i.e., they don\u2019t work hard) also preferred Trump. Trump has campaigned hard on stressing that Latino immigrants bring crime and are violent. Some Blacks and Latinos also believe that members of their community don\u2019t work hard. These voters will strongly back Trump. If Trump wins, it will be because of his exploitation of America\u2019s racial divisions.\n\nZarate: I expect that race will play a significant role in voter behavior and affect the outcome of this election. Research has found that white racial identity and white racial animus are powerful predictors of support for Trump. Much of the Trump coalition is predicated on stoking white racial animus, and this hasn\u2019t changed during his third campaign for president. If anything, with a woman of color as his opponent, now this strategy becomes even stronger.\n\nAlthough Harris\u2019 status as a woman of color risks hurting her electoral chances among racial conservatives, there is reason to believe it will help her significantly among Democrats. Prior to Harris becoming the Democratic nominee, there was a lack of enthusiasm surrounding the election. This is no longer the case as evidenced by the Harris team\u2019s fundraising numbers. Although there are likely several factors contributing to this, we have every reason to believe that Harris being a Black woman is part of it. This will be important come time to count the votes. The 2020 election underscored the importance of African American voters to Democrats, especially when thinking about the surprising presidential and senatorial victories in traditionally Republican Georgia.\n\nOn Black voter polling\n\nTate: Harris has won back most of the Black vote that had eroded under Biden\u2019s candidacy. Still, there are reportedly more Blacks supporting Trump in 2024 than in 2020. I am not sure Trump in the end will get a bump in Black support. I think Black dissatisfaction is there with both Harris and Trump. Although Harris replaced Biden, the choice in 2024 seems identical to the one in 2020 to dissatisfied Black voters. I think the turnout among Blacks might be low. The Democratic Party has to work harder on securing the support of young Black males.",

        "text": "College students in battleground states could make an election impact with registration decisions\nCollege voters are crucial, and some strategize on where to cast their ballots.\n\nWith just about two weeks until Election Day, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are working to secure votes in key battleground states where polls show a neck-and-neck race -- and part of that strategy is appealing to young voters, some of whom may have switched their voter registration to cast ballots in their college towns located in crucial swing states.\n\nCollege students are usually allowed to register to vote in \"either [their] hometown or where [they] attend college,\" depending on state residency requirements, according to vote.gov.\n\nAs a result, some students have chosen to register under the address that gives their ballot the most impact, particularly when one of their residences is located in a swing state.\n\nAnd those votes could potentially make a difference. A recent ABC News/Ipsos poll found the candidates to be tied in the seven battleground states, with 49% for Harris and 49% for Trump.\n\nGiven these incredibly tight margins in key battlegrounds, both candidates are fighting for every vote where they can.\n\nPenn State students stand in line inside the Student Union, called The Hub, waiting to cast their ballots in the presidential election in State College, Penn., Nov. 8, 2016. Jeff Swensen/Getty Images\n\n\"We've seen dozens of elections up and down the ballot over the course of the last few years that have been decided by as close as one vote,\" said Clarissa Unger, co-founder and executive director of Students Learn Students Vote Coalition, a nonpartisan national network dedicated to increasing student voter participation.\n\n\"Every single college student's vote can be consequential,\" Unger told ABC News.\n\nHow are students exercising this right?\n\nSpeaking on behalf of ALL IN Campus Democracy Challenge, a nonpartisan initiative that promotes college civic engagement, its executive director Jen Domagal-Goldman explained the motivations behind students' voting decisions.\n\n\"We know there are a few key factors that students likely consider as they're determining where they want to register to vote or if they want to update their voter registration,\" Domagal-Goldman told ABC News.\n\nShe said \"what's on the ballot\" and \"where [students] think their vote might count the most for the presidency\" are prominent motivators for college students.\n\nShe added that students are also influenced by local elections, and many choose to vote in the state that they identify with the most.\n\nJulia Levine, a 21-year-old senior at the University of Pennsylvania, told ABC News that she changed her voter registration from her home state of New York to her college state of Pennsylvania, one of the crucial battleground states in the presidential race.\n\n\"For this upcoming general election, my decision to change my registration to [Pennsylvania] was based on impact and also ease,\" she said. \"My hometown elections tend to go one way or another without much swing, so I thought my vote would count more in a swing state.\"\n\nIt's expected to be a close race in Pennsylvania: it went for Trump by more than 44,000 votes in 2016 before President Joe Biden took it back by more than 80,000 votes in 2020. Trump leads Harris by .4 points in Pennsylvania, according to 538's polling average in the state.\n\nLevine also works with Penn Leads the Vote (PLTV), a student-run, nonpartisan organization that seeks to increase voter engagement on campus. She told ABC News that many of her peers had the same idea to intentionally vote in a swing state.\n\nAccording to PLTV, about 75% of the school's enrollment rate is registered to vote, totaling about 17,000-18,000 students. Among the students originally registered out of state, Levine estimated more than half have changed their registration to their college state of Pennsylvania. The organization was not able to offer specifics on the number of students who changed their registration to Pennslyvania.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump speaks to supporters during a campaign event at Saginaw Valley State University in Saginaw, Mich., Oct. 03, 2024. Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nAlyssa Lopez, a senior at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, told ABC News that she is a first-time voter, and she became motivated because she is casting her ballot in a battleground state.\n\nOriginally from New Jersey, Lopez said there \"was no question\" that she would register to vote in her college state of Georgia rather than her hometown because she wanted her vote to make a \"true impact.\"\n\nAfter seeing abortion laws become stricter in the state of Georgia through the recent years she has lived there, Lopez realized how much was at stake during this election and she \"wanted to make a difference.\"\n\nThe race in Georgia is expected to be tight once again after Trump won the state in 2016, but Biden flipped it in 2020 -- turning the reliably red state blue by roughly 12,000 votes of more than 5 million cast.\n\nTrump is currently ahead of Harris in Georgia by 1.6 points, according to the 538 polling average in the state.\n\nKyle Nitschke, the co-executive director of the nonpartisan, student-led organization Arizona Students' Association, which represents Arizona State University, Northern Arizona University and the University of Arizona, said that the association helped more than 3,000 young adults register to vote in the swing state of Arizona this election cycle.\n\nAbout half of these registrations came from students not originally from battleground Arizona, he added.\n\n\"We had many students come up to us over the last few months excited to get registered in Arizona where they will be living for the next few years, be present during major elections and where they have more of an impact,\" Nitschke told ABC News. \"Students know the impact that they will have on deciding the next president of the United States and the future senator of Arizona.\"\n\nAccording to 538's polling average, Trump is leading by 1.9 points in the state of Arizona.\n\nHistory of voting on campus\n\nA 1979 Supreme Court case, Symm v. United States, affirmed that college students have a constitutional right to register and vote where they attend college.\n\nThe 2008 Higher Education Opportunity Act also requires universities to make voter registration information and access readily available for students on campus.\n\nBoth Unger and Domagal-Goldman pointed out that adults with multiple homes in different states also face a similar decision when deciding where to vote. They must choose one location to declare as their primary residence where they will cast a ballot -- and if one of these homes is located in a swing state, they may prefer to vote from there.\n\nDomagal-Goldman recognized that \"there may be strategy at play for some particular students or some particular voters,\" but she says it's important to remember that these are \"full-fledged adults who have the right to vote and who can choose within a specific set of legal guidelines.\"\n\n\"[College students] bring vibrancy, innovation, economic opportunities to their campuses and the surrounding communities and their institutions,\" Unger said. \"College students also bear the consequences of the public officials and government offices that oversee their schools and the communities that they reside in, and so they have the right to have a say in who governs the communities where they spend \u2026 a majority of their year while attending school.\"\n\nContinued youth outreach\n\nWhen it comes to young voters across the entire country, the Institute of Politics at the Harvard Kennedy School recently found Harris to be significantly ahead of Trump.\n\nHarris' support among this demographic has been building since President Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race in July.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris reacts as she greets people during a campaign event at Ripon College in Ripon, Wisc., Oct. 3, 2024. Evelyn Hockstein/Reuters\n\nWithin 48 hours of Biden announcing his withdrawal from the race, CEO of Vote.org Andrea Hailey cited a 700% spike in voter registrations, particularly from 18-34-year-old voters in battleground states.\n\n\"Some of the states that were affected were Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin -- so this is about to make everything very, very interesting,\" Hailey told NewsNation last month.\n\nHarris recently applauded young voters for their efforts.\n\n\"Your generation is killing it, I mean, honestly,\" Harris said on a youth organizing call last month. \"You are one of the reasons that I am so optimistic and excited about the future of our country, your generation.\"\n\nHer campaign launched a \"Back to School\" initiative over the summer, which targeted 150 college campuses with a focus on those in battleground states, in addition to a Youth Vote Week of Action following National Registration Day last month. They continue to target students on battleground campuses with digital, newsletter and flyer ads as well as text messages encouraging voter registration, the campaign told ABC News.\n\nRecognizing the power celebrities hold over America's youth, Harris appeared alongside singer Lizzo in Michigan on Saturday, in addition to campaigning with singer Usher in Georgia later that evening.\n\nFor his part, Trump has used celebrity endorsements such as television personality Amber Rose and Barstool Sports Founder Dave Portnoy to connect with younger audiences.\n\nHe has also turned to podcasters as a way to reach a diverse group of younger listeners, too.\n\nAppearing on a Barstool podcast episode of \"Bussin' with the Boys\" released last week, Trump worked to relate to the younger audience by touting the number of views he generates on shows and using sports analogies. Trump also attended the Steelers-Jets' football game on Sunday.\n\nThe candidates have both been very active on social media, embracing memes and engaging in online trends.",

        "text": "How will gender shape the presidential election?\nFrom childless cat ladies to the masculinity crisis, the gender gap is widening during this year\u2019s presidential election. We spoke with experts to get an in-depth look at how gender drives votes and what the candidates are doing to capitalize on that factor.\n\nWhat You Need To Know Gender has become an important topic in the 2024 presidential election\n\n\n\nPolls show a widening gender gap among voters\n\n\n\nExperts explain how electability bias affects female candidates\n\nSpeaking to a crowd of his supporters in August, former president Donald Trump mocked Vice President Harris\u2019s laugh.\n\n\u201cHave you heard her laugh? That is the laugh of a crazy person. That is a laugh of a lunatic.\u201d\n\nHarris has repeatedly called her opponent \u201can unserious man.\u201d\n\nA resurfaced 2021 comment from Trump\u2019s running mate, Ohio Senator JD Vance has led to a series of election-related \u201cchildless cat lady\u201d memes.\n\nAnd a suggestive hand gesture made by former president Barack Obama in conjunction with a comment about Trump\u2019s \u201cweird obsession with crowd sizes\u201d made headlines during the Democratic National Convention.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump versus Vice President Kamala Harris. Republican versus Democrat. Man versus woman. The 2024 presidential race is a battle of the sexes... or is it?\n\n\u201cAll elections are masculinity contests,\u201d argued Dan Cassino, a politics professor at Fairleigh Dickinson University. \u201cIt\u2019s just we often don\u2019t recognize it because it\u2019s two men.\u201d\n\nIn our country\u2019s nearly 250-year history, we have only known male presidents.\n\n\u201cWe define leadership traits as being masculine traits. So, when we think of masculine traits, masculine personality traits, we\u2019re talking about a genetic behavior, someone who\u2019s going to get stuff done, someone who\u2019s aggressive,\u201d Cassino said.\n\nAs candidates and political strategists have zeroed in on this, we see the masculinity contest on full display along the campaign trail.\n\n\u201cHe talked about being manly, you know, hand size and things like this, right? Using kind of brute force and strength, saying she doesn\u2019t have the presidential look,\u201d said Kelly Dittmar, a director of research at Rutgers University\u2019s Center for American Women and Politics. \u201cDonald Trump was really leaning into the fact that his masculinity, his manhood, was the primary credential.\u201d\n\nFemale candidates, on the other hand, have a distinct challenge.\n\n\u201cFemale candidates have to be masculine, have to be a leader, but they can\u2019t be too masculine because then you\u2019d be nonconforming,\u201d said Cassino.\n\n\u201cSo female candidates have to somehow be both masculine and feminine at the same time, so they have to run for office, you know, backwards and high heels.\u201d\n\nDittmar explained that much of the challenge faced by female candidates can be attributed to something called an electability bias.\n\n\u201cThe electability bias that women and particularly women of color, have faced in U.S. politics across levels of office, is especially strong at the presidential level. And what that bias is, is a presumption that the country writ large is not ready to elect a woman,\u201d Dittmar said.\n\nIt\u2019s something we saw play out in 2016 when Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ran with the \u201cI\u2019m with Her\u201d slogan and Trump went on gender-based attacks.\n\nBut in the nearly 10 years since, we have seen a shift\u2026a realignment.\n\n\u201cIn 2016, there were a lot of sexist male democrats, and they did not like Hillary Clinton. They moved over to Bernie Sanders. And a lot of those Bernie brothers from 2016 are now hardcore Trump supporters,\u201d explained Cassino.\n\nAccording to a New York Times-Siena College poll out this month, the race could have the largest gender gap since exits polls have been taken\u2014beyond the previous record of eleven percentage points reached in the 1992 and 2016 elections.\n\nVoters in the survey also think that Trump is a stronger leader while Harris is found to be more fun.\n\nOne key difference from 2016 is that Harris entered the race much later in the campaign, skipping primaries and experiencing less so-called electability bias.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s especially harmful at that primary stage because during the primary, folks are doing calculations of, I have to choose the candidates most likely to win in November,\u201d said Dittmar. \u201cDonors are doing calculation who\u2019s the most viable candidate against the Republican nominee?\u201d\n\nPerhaps as a result, we see the use of gender playing a very understated role in the Harris campaign. This, as Cassino says, Trump is making inroads with groups who value traditional masculine traits.\n\n\u201cSo young Black and Hispanic men are moving over into the Trump campaign because he\u2019s saying, I\u2019m going to fix this. I\u2019m going to give you a way forward. We can meet the demands of masculinity.\u201d\n\nBoth Dittmar and Cassino say voters don\u2019t turn out to the polls based on gender alone.\n\n\u201cScholars have done studies of what motivates your vote on Election Day, it is not gender and it is not race. In other words, you\u2019re motivated almost entirely by party,\u201d Dittmar said.\n\nIn the end, whether we come from Venus or from Mars doesn\u2019t really matter. We all end up at the ballot box.\n\nA previous version of this article had misspelled Kelly Dittmar's name",

        "text": "A tight race gets tighter as Trump closes gap with Harris - CNBC TV18\nThe clock for the US presidential election countdown continues to tick, drawing us closer to November 5, or Super Tuesday, when America will elect its next commander-in-chief.\n\nUS Vice President Kamala Harris has been riding the wave of Democratic enthusiasm sparked by Joe Biden quitting the race in July. The early lustre appears to have dimmed \u2014 Harris, who led Trump in key battleground states and the rest of the country by 2% for most of her campaign, is still ahead, but the odds have started to favour Trump, according to the latest data published by 538.\n\nAccording to 538, Harris is polling at 48.2%, while Trump is at 46.4% \u2014 a 1.8% difference between the two major party nominees in the US. This, as per an ABC News report, gives Trump a slight advantage. The report gives Trump a 52-in-100 chance of winning, compared to Harris's previous 58-in-100 odds just two weeks ago.\n\nDespite this shift, experts caution that the election remains a toss-up. A 52% chance for Trump is still very close to a coin flip (50:50), and a few favourable polls for Harris could quickly change the dynamics once again. The polling landscape indicates a razor-thin margin, with both candidates tightly contesting key swing states.\n\nAlso read: US Presidential Election: Kamala Harris triples Trump\u2019s ad spending with $270 million push\n\nSwing state dynamics\n\nPolling averages show that the margin between Trump and Harris is two percentage points or less in all seven major swing states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Nationally, Harris leads Trump by just 2%, tighter than the margins observed during Trump's 2020 campaign against Joe Biden and the 2016 election against Hillary Clinton.\n\nRecent polls reflect this closeness, with an ABC News/Ipsos poll showing Harris up by 2% nationally and a Marquette University survey indicating a 3-point lead for her. However, some polls in this volatile race have also given Trump a slight edge.\n\nStability amidst change\n\nWhile national polls have remained relatively stable over the past two months, state polls have shown more fluctuation, primarily unfavourable for Harris. This shift has contributed to a decrease in her chances of winning, according to 538's forecast.\n\nConcerns have been raised about potential bias in polling averages, particularly regarding the influence of Republican-aligned firms. However, 538 said it has implemented adjustments to account for any statistical bias, ensuring that the averages remain reliable.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nWith just over three weeks until election day, the outcome remains uncertain. Historical trends suggest that polls can shift dramatically in the final weeks of a campaign, as seen in previous elections. 538's forecast aims to quantify the likelihood of such shifts and the potential inaccuracies of polling on election day.\n\nIf the election were held today, Trump would have a 52-in-100 chance of winning, but the tight polling indicates that the final result could be drastically different. The close nature of the race suggests that either candidate could secure a significant electoral college victory if polling errors occur.\n\nAlso read: Voters split on Trump vs. Harris for economic issues, Harris leads on middle-class taxes: AP-NORC poll",

        "text": "Expert explainer: How the Electoral College works in U.S. presidential elections\nOn Nov. 5, Americans will head to the polls to cast their vote for president of the United States. How a candidate wins the election is more complicated than just votes. It actually comes down to an often misunderstood body called the Electoral College.\n\nBut what is the Electoral College and what role does it play in choosing the next president of the United States?\n\nPolitical science professor Matthew Lebo, an expert in American domestic politics with an emphasis on the presidency, Congress and elections, helps to explain how the Electoral College works and what to watch for on election night.\n\nWestern News: What is the Electoral College?\n\nMatt Lebo: The Electoral College is how the presidency is decided. There are 538 votes in the Electoral College and each state has a certain number of votes based on how many seats they have in the House of Representatives, plus their two senators. Therefore, larger states have more Electoral College votes.\n\nWhichever candidate wins the popular vote in a state gets all that state\u2019s electoral college votes. Maine and Nebraska are a little bit different because they allocate votes by congressional district. Whichever presidential candidate gets at least 270 Electoral College votes will be the winner of the Electoral College and the presidency.\n\nWhy does the U.S. use the Electoral College?\n\nML: It\u2019s incredibly arcane. It was set up by those who framed the constitution. It was intended to give a little bit more representation to smaller states when choosing the president. Theoretically it\u2019s set up so that the electors could decide the people made a bad choice, and then they would choose somebody else. That\u2019s never happened and it\u2019s difficult to imagine it ever would.\n\nI believe it is an outdated system for choosing a leader. There\u2019s no other office in the world where you\u2019re choosing one person for one job, and the person who gets the most votes doesn\u2019t necessarily win.\n\nWhat are swing states and why are they crucial?\n\nML: There are 43 states plus the District of Columbia where we\u2019re sure we know who\u2019s going to win. Then there are seven states that are extremely close in the polling and were extremely close in the 2020 election.\n\nThose seven states are Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada. The election will come down to who can win those states. There are a few different scenarios that could mean a victory for either candidate.\n\nIf Kamala Harris can win Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2013 which are states that Joe Biden won \u2013 then she could lose the rest of them and still become president. She\u2019s ahead now in Wisconsin and Michigan, so Pennsylvania is really a key state.\n\nHow does a candidate win the election without winning the popular vote?\n\nML: There are some states where a presidential candidate will win overwhelmingly.\n\nFor example, in California, Harris might win by 10 million votes, but she only needs to win by one vote to get all the Electoral College votes. A candidate can pile up the votes in states where they win, but only get so many Electoral College votes.\n\nThat\u2019s the 2016 story. Hillary Clinton won by wide margins in places like California, New York, New Jersey and Illinois. Donald Trump won in states by smaller margins but eked out enough wins in key battleground states like Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.\n\nWho are the electors on the Electoral College?\n\nML: In every state the two political parties will come up with a slate of electors. The Democratic Party has one list of names, and the Republican Party has a different list of names. Those people get on the list by being loyal to the party. Perhaps they\u2019re activists within the party or have positions within the party organizations. When a state\u2019s popular vote is decided, the slate belonging to the winning candidate\u2019s party casts its votes.\n\nCan we expect a quick result on Nov. 5?\n\nML: It is possible there will be a quick result if Pennsylvania is counted and Harris has a lead. If Harris is already doing well in rural Pennsylvania early in the evening, it\u2019s a sign that she\u2019s in very good shape. North Carolina is also counted early and if it goes to Harris, then that\u2019s hugely important, but probably it\u2019ll be a day or two days at least until we really know who won every state.",

        "text": "How soon will we know who won the presidential election? An AP editor weighs in\nHow soon will we know who won the presidential election? An AP editor weighs in\n\nJUANA SUMMERS, HOST:\n\nIt is exactly two weeks until Election Day, but election season is already in full swing, with mail-in voting and early voting already underway. As polls begin to close on November 5, a team of 5,000 people will be working with the Associated Press to tally up all those votes and get the results back to the American people as quickly as possible. And their work goes well beyond the presidential race. The AP will also call winners in roughly 7,000 state and local elections. David Scott oversees the AP's decision team, and he joins us now to explain how all of this works. Welcome.\n\nDAVID SCOTT: Hi.\n\nSUMMERS: Now, I'm a former AP staffer, so I've been able to watch this firsthand, and I know that you guys don't wait for a hundred percent of the ballots to come in before you make a call. So help us understand how you balance the need to announce a winner as soon as possible with the uncertainty and the fact that there's still ballots out there.\n\nSCOTT: Well, we start with the fact that we're not calling races until we're certain that there is a winner, right? And if that means that we have to wait for all the ballots to be counted and a race to go all the way to certification, we wait. And we have done that, and we still do that in some races that are exceptionally close and that are exceptionally tight.\n\nMost races, however, we're able to look at the data that's come in, the vote counts that have come in and the other data points that we're able to look at and analyze and see that those trailing candidates are far enough behind that there's not a chance for them to overtake the winner. So we're trying to call races as soon as possible but never at the risk of making a mistake and declaring a winner when they've not actually won.\n\nSUMMERS: I think a lot of us remember 2020, where we had really more of an election week than an Election Day, and it took days for the results in the presidential race to come in. So tell us. What do you expect this time around? Do you think that you will be able to call a winner on election night?\n\nSCOTT: You know, we're used to this idea that we should all know who the next president is going to be by the time the late local news starts on the East Coast or by the time we go to bed at night on election night. And often that's the case. Often it's not the case. It really varies. If we go back to 2000, when there was no race call on election night or - really, AP never declared a winner...\n\nSUMMERS: Right.\n\nSCOTT: ...In that race. Sometimes we're able to do it on election night. Sometimes, you know, it's Wednesday, like in the race that Donald Trump won, or when George Bush beat John Kerry. And sometimes it takes quite a bit longer. Our last presidential election went to Saturday, and it took us until that time to know the results in Pennsylvania and then ultimately that Joe Biden had won. So what I've been telling people is prepare for everything. It could be a race that's decided on election night. It could be one that takes several days. And so we're just going to have to wait to see what the voters do and what the voters decide.\n\nSUMMERS: David, former President Trump has continued to lie about the 2020 election results, and a majority of his supporters - they believe these falsehoods. The former president has cast doubt on the upcoming election, too. How are you and your team preparing for the possibility of seeing disputed election results this time around?\n\nSCOTT: Well, the good news is that our election system in this country is run by people, public servants. And they're really committed to this process. They're really, really good at it, too. There's almost no voter fraud. I mean, the number of fraudulent ballots in a presidential election you can count almost on one hand. And campaigns can make claims. Candidates can make claims. But ultimately, the numbers are what the numbers are. The voters make their choice. We get those results. They're reported by election officials. We count all of those results up, and we declare a winner. We're driven entirely by the facts. We're driven entirely by what the voters decide.\n\nSUMMERS: David, I want to end on this. I mean, there's just a lot of election-related anxiety out there, a lot of people on election night who are going to be glued to their TVs, their computers, their radio, really taking in all of this fire hose of information, trying to figure out who's won and lost races up and down the ballot. As someone who sits in the seat that's helping make these decisions and inform America, what's your advice for people as they're sitting there consuming all of this news?\n\nSCOTT: It's so hard, but just be patient. I mean, think about all the work that goes into doing a presidential election in the United States. A hundred sixty million ballots are going to be cast and counted. Voting takes place over several weeks. And yet within a couple of hours or within a couple of days, our election officials and the Associated Press - we're able to tally up all those votes and say who the winners are. And if you think about the scale of what goes into a presidential election in the United States, it's really amazing. And so we can wait, and we can be patient and let the process work itself out to know who we've picked to be our next leaders.\n\nSUMMERS: That was David Scott of the decision desk at the Associated Press, where he is also vice president and head of news strategy and operations. David, thank you so much.\n\nSCOTT: Glad to be here.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 NPR. All rights reserved.

        "text": "Important Dates In US Presidential Election 2024\nRepublican former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, a Democrat, will face each other in the November 5 US presidential election.\n\nHere is a timeline of events related to the election between now and Inauguration Day in January.\n\n- November 5: Election Day\n\n- Later in November: It could take days for the election result to be known, especially if it is close and mail-in ballots are a factor.\n\n- November 26: Trump, the first sitting or former US president to be convicted of a crime, is due to be sentenced in a Manhattan hush money case where he was found guilty of falsifying documents to cover up a payment to silence a porn star. Trump has denied wrongdoing. Sentencing was originally due to take place on September 18.\n\n- December 17: Electors, who together form the Electoral College, meet in their respective states and the District of Columbia to select the president and vice president.\n\n- December 25: The electoral votes must be received by this date by the president of the Senate - a role held by the vice president, currently Harris - and the archivist.\n\n2025\n\n- January 6: The vice president presides over the Electoral College vote count at a joint session of Congress, announces the results and declares who has been elected.\n\nAhead of the count on January 6, 2021, then-President Trump lambasted his vice president, Mike Pence, for refusing to try to prevent Congress from certifying President Joe Biden's victory over Trump. On that day, the US Capitol was attacked by Trump supporters trying to stop the count. Biden's win was certified early the next day.\n\nCongress has since passed the Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act of 2022, which requires approval of one-fifth of the House and Senate to consider a challenge to a state's results - a much higher bar than existed before, when at least one member each in the Senate and House of Representatives could together trigger a challenge.\n\n- January 20: The inauguration of the election winner and their vice president takes place. At this ceremony, the victor and the vice president are officially sworn into office.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "US presidential election briefing: Harris courts Republicans with Liz Cheney as Trump says he was \u2018saved\u2019 by God\nKamala Harris continued to court conservative voters and disaffected Republicans as she was joined on the campaign trail by Liz Cheney. Cheney, a former Republican congressperson and abortion rights opponent, condemned Republican-imposed bans on the procedure as she appeared with the Democratic presidential nominee at three events in battleground states.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pro-life and I have been very troubled, deeply troubled by what I have watched happen in so many states since Dobbs,\u201d said the daughter of former vice-president Dick Cheney.\n\nDonald Trump, meanwhile, visited hurricane-damaged North Carolina and spoke at a faith leaders meeting, where he told Christian voters to \u201cstand up and save [their] country\u201d.\n\nWith only 15 days to go until election day, the candidates are hammering home their areas of comparative advantage. A new poll found Trump may have lost his edge among voters when it comes to handling the economy, while Harris is viewed more favourably overall.\n\nHere\u2019s what else happened on Monday:\n\nTrump spent the day in North Carolina, first visiting the city of Asheville to survey the damage Hurricane Helene brought last month . He doubled down on debunked claims about the federal government\u2019s hurricane recovery efforts and promoted baseless conspiracy theories about immigration. Trump has falsely accused the White House of deliberately diverting assistance away from Republican areas after the storm ravaged the region and killed about 100 people.\n\nTrump also held a rally in Greenville, before attending a faith leaders meeting in Concord, alongside his son Eric and Dr Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon and former US housing secretary . At the Concord event, the former president leaned into religious messaging. \u201cGod saved me for a purpose,\u201d he said of his assassination attempt, later adding: \u201cI\u2019m here tonight to deliver a simple message to Christians across America. It\u2019s time to stand up and save your country.\u201d\n\nThe Central Park Five sued Trump for defamation after he falsely said during the presidential debate that they had pleaded guilty to a brutal rape 35 years ago , despite the fact that they had their convictions overturned.\n\nKey rightwing legal groups tied to Trump and his allies have banked millions of dollars from conservative foundations and filed multiple lawsuits challenging voting rules in swing states.\n\nElsewhere on the campaign trail\n\nRead more about the 2024 US election:",

        "text": "US Presidential Elections 2024: All you need to know about 2024 elections in the United States\nWith less than two months remaining until Election Day and just hours before Alabama began mailing early ballots on September 11, the recent debate offered a critical insight into the contentious presidential race. In their first and potentially sole debate before the election, Kamala Harris presented a strong case against Donald Trump, confronting him on issues such as abortion, immigration, the Israel-Gaza conflict, the Russia-Ukraine war, and the state of American democracy, highlighting their starkly differing visions for the country.\n\nThe two major political parties nominate their presidential candidates through a series of state primaries and caucuses, where voters express their preferences for who should lead the party in the general election. In the Republican Party, former President Donald Trump secured his party\u2019s nomination with a significant lead over his opponents, officially becoming the Republican nominee at the party convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. On the Democratic side, Vice President Kamala Harris entered the race after President Joe Biden withdrew, with no other Democrats contesting her candidacy. Additionally, there are independent candidates running for president.\n\n2. Who is Kamala Harris?\n\nHarris is recognized for her advocacy on issues such as criminal justice reform, healthcare, and immigration.. (File) Harris is recognized for her advocacy on issues such as criminal justice reform, healthcare, and immigration.. (File)\n\nOn July 21, U.S. President Joe Biden announced his decision to step back from the 2024 presidential race and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as the new party nominee. Harris\u2019s nomination for the upcoming November elections would be historic, mirroring her achievement in 2020 when she became the first woman, Black woman, and person of South Asian descent to serve as Vice President of the United States. Harris, who has been in office since January 20, 2021, was previously the junior senator from California from 2017 to 2021 and served as the Attorney General of California from 2011 to 2017. She is recognized for her advocacy on issues such as criminal justice reform, healthcare, and immigration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3.

        "text": "US presidential election updates: Trump goes to McDonald\u2019s while Harris delivers 60th birthday sermon\nDonald Trump visited a McDonald\u2019s franchise in Pennsylvania on Sunday, working the drive-thru and manning the fryer while he answered questions from reporters. The former president took a moment to boast about his time in office and sarcastically congratulated Kamala Harris on her 60th birthday. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll get her some fries,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThe visit was meant to be a jab at opponent Harris, who worked at the fast food chain while at college. Trump has frequently called that experience into question, without providing any evidence.\n\nHarris celebrated her birthday at two churches in Georgia, continuing her campaign\u2019s \u201csouls to the polls\u201d push to reach Black voters through religious communities.\n\nThe Democratic vice-presidential nominee, Tim Walz, visited churches in Michigan and Minnesota while Donald Trump and backer Elon Musk held separate town halls in Pennsylvania. Both campaigns are focused on rallying support from voters in the battleground states, 16 days before an election that polls suggest is still on a knife-edge.\n\nHere\u2019s what else happened on Sunday:\n\nKamala Harris election news\n\nKamala Harris celebrated her 60th birthday visiting two community churches in Georgia . The first congregation sang Happy Birthday as Harris took the stage, while Stevie Wonder joined Harris and sang Bob Marley\u2019s Redemption Song at the second visit.\n\nHarris spoke about how religious experiences in her youth in Oakland, California, influenced her politics, addressing the congregation of the New Birth Missionary Baptist church in Atlanta. Drawing on the parable of the Good Samaritan in the Gospel of Luke, the vice-president argued for policies that embrace compassion. \u201cWhat kind of country do we want to live in \u2013 a country of chaos, fear and hate, or a country of freedom, compassion and justice? \u2026 When we come across our brothers and sisters in need, let us, as the Good Samaritan did, see, in the face of a stranger, a neighbour.\u201d\n\nWalz, attending a church service in Saginaw, Michigan, slammed Trump for selling branded Bibles . \u201cWe understand in our faith, the Bible is to be read and followed and absorbed. It\u2019s not to be branded and sold for $59,\u201d Walz said, telling the crowd he felt \u201cpretty uncomfortable with this idea\u201d.\n\nHarris is not planning to campaign with Joe Biden ahead of the election. The decision was mutual, anonymous Harris campaign and White House officials told NBC News. The president will instead help Harris by leveraging his longtime political relationships. \u201cThe most important role he can play is doing his job as president,\u201d a White House official said.\n\nHarris sat down with the Rev Al Sharpton in a one-on-one interview in Atlanta on MSNBC\u2019s PoliticsNation, where she discussed the latest polling suggesting a slide in her support from Black men. \u201cThis narrative about what kind of support we are receiving from Black men that is just not panning out in reality,\u201d she said. \u201cI must earn the vote of everyone regardless of their race or gender.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump election news\n\nTrump doubled down on his dangerous rhetoric labelling Democrats as \u201cenemies from within\u201d during an interview with Howard Kurtz on Fox News, broadcast on Sunday. The former president said that \u201cradical left lunatics \u2026 the enemy from within \u2026 should be very easily handled, if necessary, by the national guard, or if really necessary, by the military\u201d, before specifically denouncing representatives Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff. Similar comments made by Trump in the past weeks have sparked concern and raised fears of an authoritarian crackdown if he were to become president again.\n\nTrump repeated his statement that the January 6 attack on the Capitol was a \u201cday of love\u201d during the same interview with Fox News. Asked whether he was comfortable calling January 6 a \u201cday of love\u201d, Trump responded: \u201cThey came down to protest a rigged election \u2026 you have the right to protest in this country.\u201d Earlier he had said \u201cthere was a beauty to it and a love to it\u201d, repeating comments he made at a recent town hall in Miami.\n\nTrump held a town hall in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, his second rally in the battleground state this weekend. The former ESPN anchor Sage Steele moderated as Trump took questions from the audience. Asked whether he would protect social security and Medicare benefits, Trump listed his priorities as \u201cno tax on social security for our seniors, that\u2019s a big deal \u2026 no tax on tips [and] no tax on overtime\u201d.\n\nElsewhere on the campaign trail\n\nElon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and owner of X, hosted a town hall in Pittsburgh in support of Trump . In a short speech, Musk repeated false and fear-mongering claims, telling those attending that \u201cthe constitution is literally under attack\u201d. Musk also discussed his aims to expedite government procedures and his promised role as \u201csecretary of cost cutting\u201d in a second Trump administration. \u201cI\u2019d like to say it\u2019s a hard job, but it\u2019s not,\u201d he said.\n\nMusk also issued his second check for a million dollars to a signatory to his petition that encourages Republicans in key states to register to vote. The tech mogul, who is worth an estimated $247bn, on Saturday pledged to give $1m each day to someone who signs a petition backing the first and second amendments.\n\nRead more about the 2024 US election:",

        "text": "US election: 14 days left \u2014 What polls say, what Harris and Trump are up to\nKamala Harris and Donald Trump are campaigning through key battleground states as the race remains tight across the country.\n\nWith two weeks remaining in the US presidential race, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are racing to secure votes in key battleground states.\n\nOn Monday, Harris, the Democratic Party\u2019s nominee, made stops in all three \u201cblue wall\u201d states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin which have traditionally voted for the party and were critical to the victories of the last two Democratic presidents.\n\nAt the same time, Trump, the Republican nominee, visited Asheville, North Carolina, where he is worried that the significant damage caused by Hurricane Helene could negatively affect the turnout in a race that surveys suggest is becoming closer by the day.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at what the polls say, the key highlights from campaigns over the previous day, and a look at what to expect next.\n\nTrump and Harris are neck-and-neck across the country\u2019s seven battleground states that can swing in favour of either candidate, according to the latest survey of voters published on Monday by The Washington Post.\n\nA poll by The Washington Post and Schar School, surveying more than 5,000 registered voters in the first half of October, showed that 47 percent are likely to support Harris and Trump each.\n\nAmong likely voters, 49 percent favour Harris compared with 48 percent for Trump.\n\nThe poll comes just as Trump\u2019s average has nudged slightly ahead of Harris in the aggregate of surveys calculated by the website FiveThirtyEight, though the margin is so small that it remains a statistical tie.\n\nAccording to FiveThirtyEight\u2019s daily election poll tracker, as of October 21, Harris was leading in the national polls and had a 1.8 percentage-point lead over Trump.\n\nBut in the key states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Nevada \u2014 which have a total of 51 votes in the 538-strong Electoral College \u2014 the two candidates are effectively tied, with less than half a percent separating them. If either Trump or Harris wins all four of these states, they are effectively guaranteed the presidency.\n\nWhat\u2019s Kamala Harris been up to?\n\nHarris\u2019s first stop on October 21 was Malvern, Pennsylvania with former Republican Congresswoman Liz Cheney. Speaking in front of a \u201cCountry Over Party\u201d banner, Cheney \u2014 the daughter of former Vice President and Iraq war architect Dick Cheney \u2014 called on Republican voters unhappy with Trump to instead support Harris.\n\nIn a post on his Truth Social platform on Monday, Trump called Cheney \u201cdumb as a rock\u201d and a \u201cwar hawk\u201d. The Cheneys are among the most high-profile Republicans to endorse Harris.\n\nWhen asked why she was supporting Harris, Liz Cheney explained that it was crucial to stand behind a candidate who defended what she called the \u201cmost conservative\u201d principle for conservatives: the US Constitution.\n\n\u201cYou have to choose in this race between someone who has been faithful to the Constitution, who will be faithful, and Donald Trump,\u201d Cheney said.\n\nSeparately, Susan Ford Bales, the daughter of former Republican US President Gerald Ford, also endorsed Harris on Monday.\n\nOn Monday, Harris also admitted the campaign was affecting her. When asked in Michigan whether she sleeps, Harris responded: \u201cI wake up in the middle of the night usually these days, just to be honest with you.\u201d\n\nBut Harris said she tries to keep a routine: \u201cI work out. I try to eat well, you know. I love my family, and I make sure that I talk to the kids and my husband every day.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz appeared on ABC\u2019s The View, a daytime talk show hosted by women, where he described some of Trump\u2019s comments on using his presidential powers to go after critics as \u201cthe talk of dictators\u201d. Walz also appeared on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart on Variety later on Monday.\n\nIf you stand for country, democracy, and the rule of law, our campaign has a place for you. https://t.co/3ebj7ky8NG \u2014 Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) October 21, 2024\n\nWhat\u2019s Donald Trump been up to?\n\nTrump spent the day in North Carolina \u2013 a swing state he has won twice, but where he is now locked in a close race with Harris, less than 1 percentage point ahead, according to the FiveThirtyEight polling average as of October 22.\n\n\u201cTo see that is incredible, the power of nature,\u201d Trump said after seeing hurricane damage in Asheville along his motorcade route. \u201cNothing you can do about it. But you\u2019ve got to get a better crew.\u201d He then expressed his sympathies to the storm victims.\n\nHe repeated an incorrect claim that the federal government does not have enough money for hurricane victims because it is being used to help immigrants in the country illegally.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t have any money left for North Carolina,\u201d he said.\n\nAsheville suffered severe damage last month from Helene, with floods washing away roads, homes and bridges across a wide section of North Carolina.\n\nTrump has accused Harris before of abandoning North Carolina and leaving hurricane victims \u201cto drown\u201d.\n\nHe also said \u2014 without evidence \u2014 that Democrats are trying to rig the 2024 election, maintaining \u2014 also without evidence \u2014 that the 2020 election he lost to President Joe Biden was marred by extensive voter fraud.\n\nTrump said he intends to take no days off leading up to the November election. \u201cI don\u2019t want a day off. We have to win,\u201d he added. When asked if he had observed any cheating incidents that made him doubt the fairness of the election, Trump replied, \u201cWell, I haven\u2019t.\u201d\n\nBut both parties agree on something\n\nHarris and Trump have one message in common, people need to go out to vote.\n\nTrump took to his social media platform Truth Social to remind supporters in Michigan that it was the last day to register to vote in the state, while Democrats rallied people to vote in the US election in a post on X.\n\nIn North Carolina Trump also urged voters not to let the storm deter them from voting. \u201cYou must get out and vote.\u201d\n\n\u201cDonald Trump knows to have a chance of winning back the White House he has to make sure his base turns out. He may not have convinced new voters, but he can\u2019t lose support from those who always backed him,\u201d Al Jazeera\u2019s Alan Fisher said, reporting from Greenville, North Carolina.\n\nHis supporters are also rallying for him as the election nears.\n\n\u201cI can tell you, if he doesn\u2019t get in, this country is gone,\u201d Kevin O\u2019Carroll, a Trump supporter, said.\n\nEarly voting is under way in almost every state across the country just 14 days before election day, November 5.\n\nMICHIGAN!

He faced some criticism following a recent event in Pennsylvania, where he challenged some Black men for not being open to the idea of a female president.\n\nMichelle Obama will make her first campaign appearance of this election cycle on October 26 in Michigan, joining Harris.\n\nTrump to participate in roundtable discussion with Latino community\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump will convene a roundtable of Latino business leaders in Miami and then return to North Carolina for the second straight day for a rally in the city of Greensboro.\n\n\u201cThe Latino community knows that President Donald J. Trump is the only candidate who can bring prosperity back to America. That\u2019s why they\u2019ll turn out in record numbers on November 5th to vote for him,\u201d his campaign website stated.\n\nTrump, like his rival Harris, is also scheduled to be in Detroit this week, following his recent comments at the Detroit Economic Club on October 10, where he decried the state of the city. In his remarks, the former president stated that the US would become like Detroit if Harris were to be elected.",

The Constitution calls for Congress to select our national executives via a \u201ccontingent election\u2019s\u201d Constitution . The only plausible scenarios here involve a 269-269 tie in which key swing states shift .",
        "text": "What would happen if Harris and Trump tie in the Electoral College?\nIn the United States, we elect our president and vice president using the Electoral College rather than the national popular vote. To win, a party\u2019s ticket must win the most votes in enough states to attain an outright majority of electoral votes \u2014 at least 270 votes out of a total of 538 (sound familiar?).\n\nBut lurking in that overall figure is the potential for no candidate to win a majority, in the case of a 269-to-269 tie. While seemingly not in play in the 2024 election, it\u2019s also possible that third parties could win sufficient electoral votes to prevent anyone from hitting 270. Regardless of how it happens, should no contender claim a majority, the Constitution calls for Congress to carry out the selection of our national executives via a \u201ccontingent election.\u201d In this scenario, the U.S. House of Representatives would choose the president, although based not on the vote of the whole chamber but each state\u2019s preferences \u2014 meaning a candidate needs majority support from 26 state delegations out of 50 to win \u2014 and the 100-seat U.S. Senate would pick the vice president based on the vote of individual senators, with 51 votes needed to win.\n\nCould we run into this situation in the 2024 presidential race? It\u2019s possible, though pretty unlikely: According to 538\u2019s presidential forecast, there\u2019s only about a 1-in-300 chance that neither Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Donald Trump attain 270 electoral votes, and the only plausible scenarios here involve a 269-269 tie in which key swing states shift in ways that appear less likely based on the current state of the race. With that in mind, let\u2019s take a look at how we could end up with contingent elections for president and vice president, and why such a development would heavily favor Republicans.\n\nHow Harris and Trump could both end up shy of 270\n\nOf the small number of scenarios in 538\u2019s presidential forecast in which Harris and Trump tie, four scenarios are by far the most plausible, making up about 4 in 5 of those rare cases. In each, Harris would capture states and congressional districts worth 225 electoral votes, while Trump would capture 219. That leaves the 94 electoral votes in the seven principal battleground states \u2014 Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2014 as well as Nebraska\u2019s 2nd District in play for a possible tie, with the outcomes in those contests varying across all four cases, as shown in the table below.\n\nThree of these four scenarios involve at least two of the three northern swing states shifting into the GOP column while the southern and western ones mostly end up in Democratic hands. That is somewhat at odds with our current forecast, which gives Trump a slightly better chance of flipping states in the Sun Belt than in the Frost Belt.\n\nOf these, Scenario 1 is the most common \u2014 only with about a 1-in-1,000 shot of happening, however \u2014 and involves Trump holding onto North Carolina and flipping Pennsylvania and Michigan, while Harris retains Wisconsin, Arizona, Georgia and Nevada from President Biden\u2019s 2020 showing. Next-most common is Scenario 2 (about a 1-in-1,200 shot), which includes mostly the same results, except with Harris and Trump trading Georgia and North Carolina\u2019s identical electoral votes. Scenario 3, has about a 1-in-1,600 shot of happening \u2014 In it, Trump reclaims the Sun Belt states and Nebraska\u2019s 2nd District while Harris holds onto the three northern battlegrounds. Scenario 4 is the least likely of this quartet (about a 1-in-2,000 chance), but it involves Trump carrying all the northern battlegrounds and Nevada while Harris wins the three southern swing states.\n\nBeyond these scenarios, a handful of even more remote possibilities exist, but they have about a 1-in-10,000 (or worse) chance of occurring. Of those, the only ones that happen at least twice in our forecast\u2019s roughly 34,000 simulations are four sets of state-by-state results in which Democratic-leaning New Hampshire or Virginia go Republican, while the outcomes in the seven key swing states vary (although Michigan remains in the Democratic column in all four). Out of the 12 other simulations that produce a tie, two involve Maine\u2019s red-leaning 2nd District going Democratic.\n\nNow, 538\u2019s forecast assumes that electoral votes will go to the candidate who has won them based on the election results \u2014 but that\u2019s not a 100-percent given. In 2020, for instance, Republicans in a handful of states that voted for Biden attempted to submit fake Republican electors to Congress in support of Trump\u2019s unfounded claims that he\u2019d actually won the election. And about two-thirds of House Republicans voted against certifying the results in one or both of Arizona and Pennsylvania. While these attempts to disrupt the 2020 election ultimately failed, they could definitely come into play in 2024, too.\n\nAdditionally, the electors of the Electoral College have some room for maneuver to cast votes for whomever they want, meaning a \u201cfaithless elector\u201d could refuse to cast their vote for the ticket they were expected to support. For instance, in 2016, five Democratic electors and two Republican electors did not cast their votes for their party tickets but instead voted for other candidates. If an election outcome were to hang on every elector like in a 269-269 tie or another very close scenario, it\u2019s unlikely that a faithless elector would cast what would amount to a protest vote \u2014 but it can\u2019t absolutely be ruled out.\n\nHow the House would elect a president\n\nIf Congress finds the absence of a majority when it gathers on Jan. 6, 2025, to certify the Electoral College results, the 12th Amendment calls for the House to \u201cimmediately\u201d choose the president from no more than the three candidates who won the most electoral votes. In a 269-269 tie, that would mean just the two major-party nominees (though a faithless elector scenario could technically introduce a third candidate). However, the choice is not based on a simple vote by the House\u2019s 435 members as a whole, but instead is decided through a unique system whereby each state casts one vote according to the preferences of each member of that state\u2019s House delegation \u2014 with states that have tied delegations potentially unable to cast a vote unless a member breaks with their party. To win, a candidate must win a majority of state delegations (26).\n\nUnder these rules, Republicans would likely hold an edge in this contingent election for president. 538\u2019s House forecast shows a tight race for overall control of the House (which, of course, is based on which party controls more individual seats), but Republicans are far more likely than the Democrats to have an edge in the House delegations from at least 26 states in the next Congress. Currently, Republicans hold a majority of the House seats in 26 states compared with the Democrats\u2019 22, while two others (Minnesota and North Carolina) are tied. Yet if we take 538\u2019s forecast and rate each state based on the race rating of its most competitive seat that would change party control, the GOP looks favored to control as many as 28 state delegations to Democrats\u2019 18 come January, with the four other states rated as toss-ups or likely to have tied delegations.\n\nBased on this metric, Republicans are currently positioned to flip at least one state delegation in their favor, and possibly more. Thanks to a new Republican-drawn congressional map in North Carolina, the GOP is all but certain to shift that state from a 7-7 tied delegation to one with at least a 10-4 Republican edge. The GOP may also have a shot at capturing Michigan, where Democrats\u2019 7-6 lead looks tenuous due to two swingy Democratic-held seats that Republicans hope to flip. And, the GOP needs to flip only one highly competitive seat in Alaska, Pennsylvania or Virginia to control the House delegations in those states, while doing the same in Colorado and Maine would produce tied delegations in states currently held by Democrats.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats have no real path to 26 state delegations in a political environment where the presidential election produces a 269-269 tie in the Electoral College. At best, they could hope to hold onto their current states \u2014 save North Carolina \u2014 and flip two competitive Republican-held seats in Arizona to remain at 22 states. But if Democrats did better than that \u2014 say by flipping GOP-leaning seats in states such as Iowa, Montana and/or Wisconsin to potentially tie those delegations \u2014 that would probably signal that Democrats are doing well enough overall that Harris is winning at the top of the ticket, making the contingent election arithmetic purely academic.\n\nWe have only one precedent for a contingent election for president: the 1824 presidential race.* At that time, the Democratic-Republicans (known then as the Republicans but unrelated to today\u2019s party) held a dominant political position amid the decline of the rival Federalist Party. As a result, four separate Democratic-Republicans contested the presidential race. To win, a candidate needed 131 electoral votes out of 261, but every contender fell short of that mark: General Andrew Jackson won 99 electoral votes, Secretary of State John Quincy Adams captured 84 electoral votes, Secretary of the Treasury William Crawford earned 41 electoral votes and House Speaker Henry Clay came in fourth with 37 electoral votes.\n\nWhen the House gathered in February 1825 to choose a president, it could only consider Jackson, Adams and Crawford \u2014 the top-three recipients of electoral votes. While all were Democratic-Republicans, the party had internal divisions that would eventually split into a new party system by the 1828 election, and the votes in the House largely followed these cleavages. Clay, speaker of the chamber deciding the election, viewed Adams as most in line with his political views and publicly backed him. Accordingly, House members from the states that had supported Clay mostly shifted to Adams\u2019 camp, which enabled Adams to win the 13 states that he needed to attain the presidency. (Jackson\u2019s supporters soon argued that Adams and Clay had struck a \u201ccorrupt bargain,\u201d whereby Clay became Adams\u2019s secretary of state in exchange for Clay\u2019s support. In 1828, Jackson went on to defeat Adams in a head-to-head rematch.)\n\nBeyond its age and unusual political context, there are other reasons this 200-year-old case might not serve as much of a precedent for a modern contingent election, though. For one, due to the 20th Amendment, the newly-elected House would elect the president rather than the outgoing Congress that did the job in 1825, back at a time when the new Congress began in early March instead of on Jan. 3.\n\nThe choice that would confront the House in January 2025 would likely be more straightforward than the decision the chamber faced two centuries ago, too. While the House had to sort out an election involving three options ostensibly from the same party in 1825, it would likely be weighing two candidates from clearly opposing parties this time around \u2014 and the two-party division in the House today is readily apparent. As a result, it\u2019s very difficult to imagine any Democrat or Republican deciding to vote for the other party\u2019s candidate in a contingent election, a move that could effectively end the defector\u2019s political career at a time of intense partisanship \u2014 especially if the vote is public. (In 1825, the House chose to conduct its contingent election in closed proceedings using a secret ballot, but the preferences of individual members soon became public knowledge.)\n\nHow the Senate would elect a vice president\n\nHarris\u2019s rise to become her party\u2019s standard bearer is only the latest demonstration of how important the vice presidency is \u2014 and it\u2019s the Senate that would decide who fills this key position if no vice presidential candidate earned a majority in the Electoral College. Unlike the House, a Senate contingent election vote would be based on a vote of the chamber as a whole, in which a candidate needs 51 of 100 votes to win. Additionally, the Senate can only consider the top two recipients of electoral votes, so even if a faithless elector casts a vote for another vice presidential candidate, the Senate would find itself picking between the major-party running mates: Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.\n\nThe Senate math favors Republicans to win a contingent election for vice president, too, due to their seeming edge in the race to control the upper chamber. Currently, Democrats hold a 51-to-49 majority, including the four independents who caucus with them. But Republicans are essentially guaranteed to pick up a Democratic-held seat in dark red West Virginia to get to 50-50. Next, Democratic Sen. Jon Tester is at least a slight underdog to win reelection in Republican-leaning Montana, while Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown is in a toss-up race to keep hold of his Ohio seat. Furthermore, Democrats are fighting to defend five seats in key presidential swing states (Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin), which could also bear some fruit for the GOP. On top of this, Democrats have only a small chance of capturing GOP-held seats in states like Texas and Florida.\n\nNow, it\u2019s possible that the Senate math would not be as straightforward as the House because the GOP caucus will include some senators who have been more openly critical of Trump. For instance, three Republican senators who voted to impeach Trump after the events of Jan. 6 \u2014 Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska \u2014 will still be in office this January. One of them (particularly Murkowski, reelected in 2022 by Alaska\u2019s ranked-choice voting system) might vote against Vance in a contingent election. Still, it\u2019s more likely than not that the GOP would have the upper hand.\n\nThat being said, any unexpected delays in the House\u2019s process to elect a president could also cloud the Senate picture. Based on the 12th Amendment, if the House fails to elect a president by Inauguration Day (Jan. 20), the Senate\u2019s choice for vice president would serve as acting president until the House elects a president. And if the Senate also fails to choose a vice president, the Presidential Succession Act calls for the Speaker of the House to be next in line to serve as acting president. (Assuming that individual meets the presidential eligibility requirements and that the House is able to select one \u2014 the latter hasn\u2019t happened easily in recent times.)\n\nJust once has the Senate had to elect a vice president, and no, it actually wasn\u2019t in 1824-25 when the House had to elect a president. In that election, Sen. John Calhoun won a majority of votes for the position in the Electoral College from a mix of electors who mainly backed Jackson or Adams for president. Rather, the one time the Senate elected a vice president was in February 1837, following the 1836 election when no vice presidential candidate won a majority of electoral votes because of intraparty dislike for Richard Mentor Johnson, the running mate of the victorious presidential candidate, Democrat Martin Van Buren.\n\nIn the 1836 election, the Van Buren-Johnson ticket carried states worth 170 electoral votes, surpassing the necessary 148 of 294 to win. However, while Virginia\u2019s 23 Democratic electors voted for Van Buren, they voted for a different vice presidential candidate, leaving Johnson just shy of a majority with 147 electoral votes. A Kentucky representative and former senator, Johnson had alienated some in his party, especially in the South, due to his common-law marriage to an enslaved Black woman. However, a mostly party-line vote in the Senate easily elected Johnson as vice president, 33 to 16. Johnson\u2019s political difficulties continued, though, as the Democrats refused to renominate him at their 1840 convention, although he served as the party\u2019s de facto nominee in most states as Van Buren lost reelection.\n\n***\n\nIt\u2019s quite unlikely, but not impossible, that we could find ourselves in a situation where Congress has to decide the next president and vice president. But as the 1824-25 example shows, a contingent election to decide the next occupant of the White House could bring with it ample controversy and dissatisfaction that could carry on for years to come.\n\nFootnote\n\n*The Electoral College result in the 1800 election also required the House to choose the president, but that took place before the passage of the 12th Amendment (that election precipitated its implementation), so the 1824 election is the only contingent election for president to occur under the rules that would govern one today.\n\nCORRECTION (Oct. 22, 2024, 10:15 a.m. Eastern): This article originally said that two Republican senators who voted to impeach Trump in 2021 will still be in the Senate in January 2025. That missed Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, so the figure is actually three.",

        "text": "For NPR news executive Eric Marrapodi \u201903, journalism and elections demand receipts\nIn a nation with deep partisan fissures, Eric Marrapodi \u201903 believes coverage of the 2024 presidential election has demanded relentless journalism and airtight, evidence-based facts.\n\nMarrapodi, vice president for news programming at National Public Radio, refers to this covenant of truth as receipts, proof based on facts \u2014 not deception, not disinformation, and, most certainly, not lying.\n\n\u201cOne of the things we talk about a lot is receipts. You better bring your receipts when you're a journalist and you're turning in a story because receipts matter,\u201d said Marrapodi, a guest of Quinnipiac University\u2019s Critical Conversations Speaker Series last week.\n\nWith a presidential election just days away and seven swing states expected to determine the outcome, transparency in reporting \u2014 with real voices in real time \u2014 is what NPR tries to do best for its listeners.\n\n\u201cWe want to cover both sides completely and accurately, and if someone is lying, we will report that someone is lying,\u201d Marrapodi said. \u201cAnd if someone is hiding the truth, we will say that they\u2019re hiding the truth. It\u2019s our job in an election to go out there and cover things completely, honestly and accurately, and bring the receipts for the audience.\u201d\n\nMarrapodi\u2019s talk in the Mount Carmel Auditorium was moderated by Mary Snow, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll and a former CNN political correspondent.\n\nWhile Doug Schwartz, associate vice president and director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute, had a prior commitment, other members of the Critical Conversations ad hoc committee were present, including David Fryson, the interim vice president for equity and inclusion, and Nadine Barnett Cosby, the new School of Communications dean.\n\n\u201cPresident Olian has asked us to provide a multitude of perspectives in these critical conversations, particularly as we enter the national elections next month, which to my mind is the currency of a well-ordered democracy,\u201d Fryson said.\n\nFor Marrapodi, who served as NPR\u2019s lead producer of live special coverage for the 2020 election, this moment is both urgent and massive. It\u2019s critical to get the coverage right. While Marrapodi is committed to the work before him and his team, that doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t feel its weight.\n\n\u201cGiven the climate of where we are, this race feels consequential and it feels heavy,\u201d said Marrapodi, who met with student media before his talk. \u201cIt feels impactful on one side for people who identify as Democrats because they feel like democracy is on the ballot.\"\n\n\u201cOn the other side, people on the right tell us they feel like the economy and immigration are overwhelming and there has to be a major change for them,\u201d he added. \u201cThey feel like they're losing their country, so you have that real tension.\u201d\n\nMarrapodi said there are two ways the media can cover an election. Journalists can cover the horse race or cover the issues. But once President Joe Biden dropped out of the race, it became both \u2014 a horse race to November and a deep dive into Harris and her policy views.\n\nWhile former President Donald Trump, a Republican, was already a well-known political figure, Harris was much lesser known. In July, when Harris replaced Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket, the reporting quickly turned to the \u201cWho is Kamala Harris?\u201d stories.\n\nAnd, just as quickly, it turned to the Electoral College map and the country\u2019s seven swing states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\n\u201cWhat we decided to do in covering those issues was put our journalists in places where we knew people were going to have an impact on the election,\u201d Marrapodi said. \u201cWhat do they care about the most? How can we dig into those issues? And how can we get a better sense of where that state is in the moment?\u201d\n\nMarrapodi said one of NPR\u2019s most curious findings has been that gender is a bigger issue than race with many voters.\n\n\u201cI've been surprised by how real the gender issue is ... with Vice President Harris. It\u2019s just been really interesting to hear people say that on the record to us, both men and women,\u201d Marrapodi said. \u201cThat's been surprising in a place like Pennsylvania. Michigan was another place you heard that as well.\u201d\n\nWith \u201crazor-thin\u201d margins in the presidential race, Marrapodi said he doesn\u2019t expect the winner to be decided on election night.\n\nConsider: In 2020, although Biden beat Trump by nearly 7 million votes in the popular vote, if 44,000 votes in Georgia, Arizona and Wisconsin had gone to Trump, he would have been reelected as president, Marrapodi pointed out.\n\nSnow, meanwhile, sourced some of the latest findings from the Quinnipiac University Poll.\n\n\u201cSome of the questions in our polls over the past couple of years are questions I never thought we would ask,\u201d Snow said. \u201cBut we did ask a question in our national poll last month. We asked people how concerned they were about politically motivated violence following the outcome of the 2024 presidential election.\u201d\n\nThe response was noteworthy \u2014 73% of respondents are concerned, about 4-in-10 are very concerned and another third are somewhat concerned.\n\nMarrapodi suggested a different perspective.\n\n\u201cI think it's worth remembering that as bad as things seemed in 2020, as a country, we\u2019re pretty resilient and we made it through,\u201d Marrapodi said. \u201cThere are a lot of people in this country at 9,000 different polling places that are run by volunteers and voting officials. We have a very sort of fragmented system intentionally for voting in this country.\"\n\n\u201cPeople of goodwill come together and work to keep those polls open to allow our fellow citizens to cast their ballots,\u201d Marrapodi said. \u201cThat process has worked for hundreds of years, and I think it\u2019s a pretty resilient system. I'm confident things will be OK. It might be rough. It might be tough. But I think America is a pretty resilient place.\u201d",

        "text": "We went to Ireland to escape election stress, but found Europeans very nervous about America too \u2022 Ohio Capital Journal\nWe ducked into a Dublin pub to grab a quick pint and wound up getting an earful on the American presidential race from nervous Europeans. Their anxiety about the U.S. election was off the charts. We traveled across the pond to escape the stress of politics back home, but these folks talked of nothing else.\n\nSo, over a Guinness (or two) we listened. Locals shared their alarm about the approaching vote in America and their perplexity about why it was such a close affair. A former officer in the British Royal Air Force (RAF) who spent a career working for NATO drew his chair nearer to us. His wife joined him.\n\nLike many folks overseas, they keenly followed the American campaign and shuddered to think of the global ramifications of another Trump presidency. The retired lieutenant colonel, whose work had taken him to the states (including Wright-Patterson Air Force Base east of Dayton) was gravely worried about NATO\u2019s future if its most prominent critic and Putin fanboy returned to power in the U.S.\n\nTrump, the couple noted, had a lengthy history of bashing the security alliance and particularly European allies with appalling comments \u2014 including one (this year) in which he declared that he would encourage Russia \u201cto do whatever the hell they wanted\u201d to any NATO member country that didn\u2019t meet his definition of contributing enough defense spending.\n\nThe candidates, the ballot measures, and the tools you need to cast your vote. 2024 Ohio Voter Guide\n\nThe remark stunned members of the collective military pact on both sides of the Atlantic and confirmed Europe\u2019s worst fears about Trump throwing allied nations to the wolves should he win. The threat kept the old RAF pilot up at night. His wife shifted apprehensively.\n\nTrump\u2019s long-standing affinity for Putin, she said, combined with the former president\u2019s cavalier taunts to undermine NATO (or threaten U.S. withdrawal) horrified Europeans eying Russia\u2019s re-emergence as a murderous regime on the prowl for an empire. The strength of trans-Atlantic cooperation on vital security and peace hung in the balance of the American election for president.\n\nThe destabilizing implications of a post-American NATO for the European Union were too disturbing to contemplate. In all the biggest conflicts in and around Europe, the U.S has played a central role as a global peacemaker, the pair argued. But if the continent\u2019s most important partner is again led by Trump \u2014 whose previous administration strained the transatlantic relationship \u2014 the next iteration would almost certainly be worse.\n\nThe conversation went into overdrive. Somebody noted the ex-president\u2019s open support for Europe\u2019s autocratic governments, such as Victor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s party in Hungary, and how the high-profile endorsement of anti-democratic leadership had already emboldened the far-right internationally. A comeback for a vengeful Trump (without guardrails) would further legitimize European nationalists and populists.\n\nEurope\u2019s firewall against the extreme right holds for now but the outcome of the U.S. election could change everything. \u201cWe are really scared,\u201d confided the wife of the RAF veteran. She was under no illusions about Trump\u2019s fantasy to replicate a \u201cHungarian style\u201d regime in America where the president governs without checks and balances. His absolute predominance over the state is already spelled out in the dystopian Project 2025 manifesto.\n\nLike others tracking the U.S. election abroad, the NATO couple remained baffled by millions of American voters inextricably wedded to Trump \u2014 no matter what. They display blind allegiance to their cult of personality leader regardless of what he has done of vows to do. They\u2019re Team Trump despite all.\n\nDespite his promise to be a dictator on day one of a second term. Despite his attempt to overturn a presidential election he lost and lied about (\u201cstolen election\u201d) to retain power. Despite his charge to armed supporters on Jan. 6 to \u201cfight like hell.\u201d Despite his undisguised glee when they stormed the U.S Capitol, beat police, hunted lawmakers and tried to hang his vice-president in Trump\u2019s name.\n\nDespite his recasting of the violent insurrection as \u201ca day of love\u201d when \u201cnothing\u201d was \u201cdone wrong\u201d and insistence that the transfer of power in 2021 was really peaceful \u2014 under savage assault. Despite his refusal to commit to a peaceful transfer of power after the 2024 election while he seeds fertile ground for post-election violence with increasingly extreme rhetoric.\n\nDespite his deeply ominous suggestion that \u201cthe enemy from within,\u201d or fellow Americans in the political opposition or free press, are more dangerous than foreign adversaries and may need to be handled by the National Guard or the military. Despite being a twice-impeached disgrace, convicted felon, adjudicated rapist and criminal defendant in four pending cases. Despite all that.\n\nConfounded Europeans pressed us on why Trump voters continue to back him without question. Their support seems impervious to the outrage he generates or the objective facts he denies. The Republican presidential nominee is running neck and neck with the Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump could be inaugurated this January following the fourth anniversary of the insurrection he incited. We\u2019ve crossed into crazy.\n\nThe international therapy group across the pond dusted off the last of the Guinness in a neighborhood pub and carried on. Unsettled. The American tourists were spent. An existential turning point in America we could hardly imagine let alone explain five years ago has us living on a knife\u2019s edge. We were at a loss for words. Like the rest of the world.",

        "text": "2024 U.S. Presidential Election Special Series\nThere are two weeks to go until the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election. Interest, speculation, and tension have been building all year.\n\nMost news coverage of the election is intended to sway voters, hyperbolic to a fault, and not tailored to the specific information needs of procurement and supply chain professionals. What we really need to know is what each major party candidate has said and what likely outcomes that would lead to.\n\nIn this four-part special series, we will cover the policies and plans of Democratic Candidate Vice President Kamala Harris and Republican Candidate Former President Donald J. Trump as well as how they compare.\n\nPart 1: Playing Politics with Supply Chains\n\nIs it possible to discuss politics without stoking division or getting into trouble? It is if you stick to a set list of policies, limit research to primary sources so that all information is in the candidate\u2019s own words, and invoke \u2018Roadhouse Rules.\u2019\n\nIn part 1, I explain the intent behind the series, explain the policy areas we will examine, and outline our hopes and expectations for passionate but constructive discussion that stays focused on what the election means for corporate strategy.\n\nPart 2: Democratic Candidate Vice President Kamala Harris\n\nVice President Kamala is 60 Years old and a former Senator and Attorney General from the State of California. She became the presumptive Democratic nominee on July 21, 2024 when President Biden suspended his campaign for re-election, and the official nominee on August 22 when she accepted the nomination at the Democratic National Convention.\n\nHarris\u2019s clearest policy positions include renewable energy and the environment, with little detail available to clarify her position on trade and tariffs. She has made strong statements about China, specifically around the race to dominate AI, domestic labor protections, and intellectual property concerns.\n\nPart 3: Republican Candidate Former President Donald J. Trump\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is 78 Years old, and a former businessman/real estate developer as well as the former host of The Apprentice. He became the nominee on July 18, 2024 when he accepted the nomination at the Republican National Convention\n\nTrump\u2019s clearest policy positions include trade, and China, with little detail available to clarify his position on emissions and the environment. He has made strong statements about energy policy, both the cost and availability of energy, and the importance of emphasizing domestic production over imports from other parts of the world.\n\nPart 4: Head-to-Head Comparison of Candidate Policies\n\nWith less than two weeks until election day, procurement and supply chain professionals must have plans in place for the eventuality of either candidate being voted into office, focusing on the areas where they agree as much as where they differ.\n\nWhen lined up side by side, this election will give us either supply chain policy based on certain industries or one that is focused on domestic production, exploring a diverse range of energy sources or the effective cost of the energy that is available, opposing plans on corporate taxes, but philosophical alignment on China.\n\nSubscribe to Art of Procurement\n\nApple | Stitcher | iHeart Radio | Email\n\nLinks & Resources\n\nVice President Kamala Harris Information Sources:\n\nFormer President Donald Trump Information Sources:",

        "text": "2024 US Presidential Election Media Impact Analysis \u2013 Fifth Edition\nDates covered in this report: July 15, 2024 to September 23, 2024\n\nIn the last reporting period the presidential election saw a significant strategy change by the Democratic party on the heels of the first assassination attempt on former president Donald Trump. President Biden stepped down and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democrats top pick.\n\nThis time period has been a pivotal stretch in the lead-up to the 2024 US presidential election. Both major parties and their candidates have been actively strategizing and positioning themselves to capture voter attention and support, while addressing critical issues facing the country.\n\nKamala Harris as the Democratic Presidential Candidate: A Historic and Symbolic Candidacy\n\nKamala Harris\u2019s elevation as the Democratic Party\u2019s presidential candidate marks a historic milestone in U.S. political history. As the first Black woman and first person of South Asian descent to be nominated by a major party, her candidacy symbolizes the growing diversity within the Democratic Party and the broader American electorate. For many, her presence on the ticket represents a breakthrough moment in the fight for representation and inclusion in politics.\n\nHarris\u2019s personal story is central to her political identity. Born to immigrant parents\u2014her mother from India and her father from Jamaica\u2014Harris has often spoken about her upbringing and how it shaped her views on justice, equality, and opportunity.\n\nHarris has positioned herself as a champion of civil rights, criminal justice reform, and social equality.\n\nOn the policy front, Harris has staked out positions that appeal to a wide range of Democratic voters. She has been a vocal advocate for reproductive rights, particularly in the wake of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, and has championed progressive policies on healthcare, climate change, and immigration reform. Harris\u2019s candidacy is also seen as a continuation of President Joe Biden\u2019s agenda, which includes major investments in infrastructure, combating climate change, and expanding access to healthcare.\n\nHowever, Harris faces challenges as the party\u2019s nominee. Progressives have at times questioned her commitment to more transformative policies, while conservatives have attacked her record as too liberal, particularly on issues like crime and immigration. Navigating these criticisms while defining her own vision for the presidency will be a critical task for Harris as she moves forward in the race.\n\nTrump\u2019s Shift in Strategy: Targeting Harris and Reframing the Election\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has built his political brand on countering Democratic candidates, and with Kamala Harris as the Democratic standard-bearer, Trump has adjusted his tactics to address her candidacy directly. Trump\u2019s campaign in 2020 relied heavily on attacking Joe Biden, framing him as a weak leader and a symbol of establishment politics. However, with Harris at the top of the ticket, Trump has shifted his focus to exploit perceived vulnerabilities in her political background and campaign platform, while continuing to rally his base with his hallmark populist message.\n\nOne of Trump\u2019s primary tactics has been to paint Harris as a radical leftist, an extension of a broader Republican strategy aimed at labeling the Democratic Party as being out of touch with mainstream America. Trump\u2019s campaign has emphasized Harris\u2019s progressive stances on issues like criminal justice reform and healthcare, often distorting her record to suggest that she supports extreme policies such as defunding the police and open borders. This line of attack is aimed at moderates and suburban voters, who could be swayed by concerns about public safety and immigration enforcement\u2014key issues for many voters, particularly in swing states.\n\nTrump has also sought to portray Harris as inexperienced and unqualified for the presidency. Throughout his rallies and media appearances, Trump has repeatedly questioned Harris\u2019s readiness to lead, pointing to moments in her political career that have drawn criticism, such as her handling of criminal justice issues as California\u2019s attorney general. This critique dovetails with Trump\u2019s broader message about the Biden administration, which he has characterized as incompetent and ineffective. By casting Harris as a continuation of what he portrays as failed leadership, Trump is hoping to sway voters who may have reservations about Biden but are still undecided about Harris.\n\nIn addition to his attacks on Harris\u2019s record, Trump has also made an effort to contrast himself with Harris on issues like economic management and foreign policy. Trump\u2019s campaign has focused heavily on the economy, presenting his time in office as a period of economic growth and prosperity, while blaming the Biden administration\u2014and by extension, Harris\u2014for inflation, rising interest rates, and high energy costs. By framing the election as a referendum on economic performance, Trump aims to appeal to voters who may be disillusioned by the current state of the economy but are hesitant to embrace Harris\u2019s progressive economic agenda.\n\nHarris\u2019s Counter to Trump\u2019s Strategy: A Unified Democratic Front\n\nKamala Harris and the Democratic Party have anticipated many of Trump\u2019s lines of attack and have been preparing a counter-strategy designed to neutralize his criticisms while rallying their base. Harris has sought to frame Trump\u2019s rhetoric as part of a broader pattern of divisiveness and fear mongering, contrasting it with her own message of unity and progress.\n\nIn response to Trump\u2019s economic critiques, Harris has highlighted the Biden administration\u2019s achievements, such as job creation, infrastructure investments, and reducing the unemployment rate, while calling for further reforms to address income inequality and climate change.\n\nHarris\u2019s campaign has also focused on voter mobilization efforts, particularly among the key demographic groups that Trump is targeting. Recognizing that suburban women, young voters, and minority communities will be crucial to her success, Harris has leaned into her identity as a woman of color and her commitment to progressive values. She has made reproductive rights, climate action, and criminal justice reform central themes of her campaign, aiming to energize voters who may be concerned about Trump\u2019s policies and rhetoric.\n\nA Defining Race for Both Candidates\n\nThe 2024 presidential race between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump presents a defining moment for both candidates and the United States. Harris\u2019s historic candidacy as the first woman of color to lead a major party ticket brings with it opportunities to reshape American politics and energize key voter groups.\n\nHowever, Trump\u2019s recalibrated strategy shows that he is prepared to fight hard, using a mix of attacks on her policy positions, her readiness to lead, and identity-based appeals to his base.\n\nAs the race continues, it will be crucial to see how both candidates adapt their strategies in response to an evolving political landscape. For Harris, the challenge will be to define her own vision for the presidency and connect with voters across a wide ideological spectrum.\n\nFor Trump, the task will be to sustain his base while making inroads with moderate and swing voters, particularly in the face of Harris\u2019s unique appeal.\n\nUltimately, the outcome of this race will have far-reaching implications for the future of American politics and governance.",

        "text": "U.S. Presidential Election 2024: Latinos reflect on key issues\nTo find the common good to help them vote in the upcoming U.S. election, one may want to start by looking at the Latino voter. According to figures released from the 2020 U.S. Census, half of all first-time voters will be Latinos.\n\n\"In Rome, religious are meeting to talk about listening, walking together in discernment,\u201d said Aleja Hertzler-McCain, a reporter for Religion News Service. \u201cThere's a process that has used that consultation method to decide the pathway forward for Hispanic and Latino ministry in the U.S. The process and the centrality at the heart underlines the common good.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the Latino culture can inject more humor\u201d than the prevailing Anglo culture, said Santiago Ramos, executive editor of Wisdom of Crowds, a project of the Aspen Institute\u2019s Philosophy and Society Initiative.\n\n\u201cWe are big on family, family values. We throw big parties, we eat a lot of food, everybody is invited to our gatherings, so our faith teaches us that we are built to be in communion in relationship with God and in relationship with one another,\u201d noted Lia Garcia, director of Hispanic ministry in the Archdiocese of Baltimore.\n\nTop issues\n\n\u201cSuffering is almost like a precondition to empathy to understanding the needs of the other,\u201d said Father Agustino Torres, a priest with the Franciscan Friars of the Renewal based in New York City, and founder of Coraz\u00f3n Puro (Pure Heart) and Latinos por la Vida (Latinos for Life).\n\n\u201cSo, if a necessary element in the common good is understanding the need of the other, we've been wounded and this can be transformed into entering into the pain, the experience of another \u2014 and this is something we can bring to the common good,\u201d Father Torres said.\n\nHow would that translate at the voting booth Nov. 5? \u201cLatinos have historically turned out at lower rates than other racial and ethnic communities,\u201d Hertzler-McCain said, \u201cso that will be a big question by watching what does turnout look like, because that will have a big impact.\u201d\n\nThe economy in general, and inflation in particular, is the top issue for Hispanic voters, she added. \u201cOther issues that come in as important on a secondary level are immigration, health care, gun policy, violent crime, and Supreme Court appointments, so those are important.\u201d\n\nYet \u201cdespite our Catholic bishops\u2019 teaching that Catholic voters should take abortion as their preeminent priority in approaching this election,\u201d Hertzler-McCain said, \u201conly 5% of Latinos said abortion was their top issue.\u201d\n\nFor her, the real question is how common the common good is.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey had (said) one in ten of Latinos were (religiously) unaffiliated and that tripled by 2022,\u201d Hertzler-McCain said. \u201cIn the same 2022 poll, they had slightly under half of 18 to 29 Latinos being religiously unaffiliated. We know they are intending to support Kamala Harris and their views on abortion. The other thing we know from unaffiliated people in general: They tend to vote less than affiliated people.\u201d\n\nCatholic social teaching\n\n\u201cI see how social Catholic teaching and the common good is lived and practiced every day in our communities,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cWe now have a plan for national Hispanic ministry and in that plan, it allows us to tap into what are the priority areas for Hispanic Latino ministry here in the United States, and one is Catholic social teaching.\u201d\n\nGarcia added, \u201cWe have to continue accompanying people, especially young people. Something I have witnessed \u2014 and people have reported on it \u2014 is how our children, my children born here in the United States, like many of you whose parents are older, they have a different mentality; they might vote differently from you. Sometimes they crash, they clash, when it comes to the candidate they are going to vote for, but ultimately, they recognize they are family \u2014 then they have to be there for one another.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomething that we try to teach everyone and respectfully call people on is, we have an obligation to our brothers and sisters,\u201d Father Torres said, illustrating his point from personal experience.\n\n\u201cI got invited to give a preaching at a pretty well-to-do suburban area not too far from our location in New Jersey,\u201d he said, \u201cI asked them, \u2018There are our brothers and sisters, what are we doing for them?\u2019 I am sure there are great things for people, but I have never been invited back to that place.\u201d\n\nFather Torres said, \u201cYou can't read the words of Jesus Christ and skip over his call for us to engage the poor radically. It is something that each one of us has to answer (for).\u201d\n\nFor Ramos, who was born in Paraguay, \u201cwhen you see the contrast between the world around you and the culture that you take to the place, that's when you find out what your identity is.\u201d\n\nThe problem Ramos has with ideology, he said, is that \u201cit is a narrative reality that excludes a lot of reality. It doesn't let you see a lot of things. \u2026 Ideology doesn't want us to see the particular ways that we treat migrants.\u201d\n\nFather Torres concurred. \u201cWe sometimes become more Catholic, sometimes we're (more) American-Catholics than Catholic-Americans,\u201d he said. \u201cWe allow our politics to inform our faith than our faith informing our politics. We read more from the gossip providers rather than the Gospel.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe think about our brothers and sisters who have died trying to cross the border,\u201d Garcia said, \u201cthe thousands of people whose names we will never know, the millions of people who have undergone so much pain, women who have been gone through so many atrocities trying to reach the better land.\u201d\n\nAlthough some offered perspectives on where demographic subgroups of U.S. Latinos are leaning toward in the presidential election, or suggesting whose campaign better aligns with Catholic interests, Hertzler-McCain said, \u201cI think it is up to voters to decide whether each candidate's vision for the common good sounds appropriate or not.\u201d",

        "text": "Who does China's president want to win the U.S. election?\nThough Taiwan was generally happy with Trump\u2019s approach to the island while in office, more recently he has called on Taiwan to pay Washington more for its defense and accused the island of undermining the U.S. semiconductor manufacturing industry.\n\nAsked whether he would use U.S. military force to defend Taiwan against Chinese aggression, Trump told the Wall Street Journal editorial board last week that he \u201cwouldn\u2019t have to\u201d because Xi \u201crespects me and he knows I\u2019m f------ crazy.\u201d He said he would respond by imposing tariffs on China of 150% to 200%, perhaps even halting trade entirely with one of the United States\u2019 biggest trading partners.\n\nConsistent with U.S. policy, Harris has also declined to say whether she would use military force to defend Taiwan. Instead she emphasizes the importance of military communications with China and supporting Taiwan\u2019s ability to defend itself.\n\nTariff talk\n\nThough Trump talks far more about China on the campaign trail than Harris does, neither of them have said much about how they would manage ties with Beijing.\n\nThat may be at least partly because taking a tough line on China is one of the few areas of agreement between Trump and Harris, as well as their parties. But China is also not high on the list of voters\u2019 national security priorities compared with immigration and the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East.\n\nIn the presidential debate last month, China came up mostly in the context of tariffs.\n\nBiden has maintained and in some cases expanded tariffs on Chinese imports that Trump introduced as president, citing national security concerns. If she wins, Harris is expected to continue Biden\u2019s targeted tariffs and restrictions on key Chinese tech sectors.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has doubled down on the idea of taxing imports, proposing blanket tariffs as high as 20% on goods from all countries and 60% or higher on goods from China. According to the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a Washington-based think tank, Trump\u2019s proposals would cost the typical U.S. household more than $2,600 a year.\n\nTrump\u2019s harsher trade policies toward China, combined with his antipathy toward U.S. alliances in the Asia-Pacific, point to greater instability in U.S.-China relations, said Wu Xinbo, director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai.\n\n\u201cUnder a Trump presidency, Sino-U.S. relations will witness intense frictions, serious crises and even military conflicts,\u201d he wrote in a recent essay for the Asia Society Policy Institute.",

        "summary": " Donald Trump was voted 'Employee of the Month' at McDonald\u2019s . The billionaire appeared to have found his most natural habitat at the fast-food chain . Trump has always been fixated with McDonald's, being a huge fan of the Big Mac .",
        "text": "Donald Trump: US Presidential Election Top 10: Donald Trump \u2013 McDonald\u2019s \u2018Employee of the Month\u2019\nOne of politics' greatest drawbacks is that it favours gifted thespians or orators over able administrators. How natural one appears while serving takeout at McDonald\u2019s or buying Doritos shouldn\u2019t decide who gets to hold the nuclear football and become the leader of the free world. Sadly, that\u2019s not how the ball rolls, and ever since being shoehorned in at the last minute after Democrats refused to accept the reality about Joe Biden Kamala Harris has been going all out to prove she\u2019s relatable, which has been a hard sell so far. She also appears to have a bizarre strategy of media engagement, where she first avoided interviews, but then started giving more, getting stuck in David Sacks\u2019 prophetic \u201cdoom loop\u201d: the more interviews Harris gives, the more her ratings suffer. On the other hand, Donald Trump appears to have found a second wind in recent weeks and is looking stronger than ever, the bumbling old man of the ABC debate completely forgotten.Trump\u2019s mini-renaissance appears to have started from the Flagrant podcast . He was in fine form during the Al Smith Dinner that Kamala Harris skipped, a curious choice given Catholics aren\u2019t just a significantly high voting bloc but consist of much of the \u201chaves and have-lots\u201d, who George W Bush once joked was his base. Of course, Harris\u2019 decision to skip the Al Smith Dinner could have been mediated by her strong pro-abortion stance, given Donald Trump\u2019s role in overturning Roe vs Wade .Trump chose his McDonald\u2019s stint to coincide with Kamala Harris\u2019 60th birthday. During the gig, Trump appeared to have been doing this his entire life, the bankrupt billionaire looking like he had finally found his most natural habitat. Of course, Trump has always been fixated with McDonald\u2019s, being a huge fan of the Big Mac and even greeting guests at the White House with fare from the Golden Arches.In its own way, McDonald\u2019s is America, and Trump appeared to have morphed into Mr America in his red tie and golden hair. He joked with the owner (\u201cHow much are you paying me?\u201d), before putting on the apron, working the French fry counter, and handing out a few bags of food to drive-in customers. The customers, carefully handpicked, included a black couple and an Indian-origin couple, clearly designed to show the new diverse MAGA that includes the likes of Vivek Ramaswamy.The fact is that McDonald\u2019s isn\u2019t just a fast-food chain; it\u2019s an enduring symbol of American capitalism and everything great about it. It unifies beyond race, gender and creed, the North Star of the American story where any hardworking individual could \u2013 through grit and hard work \u2013 own a joint that fuels obesity and diabetes. There are nearly 14,000 McDonald\u2019s outlets in America, and a 'like' from McDonald\u2019s on social media is the American equivalent of a knighthood. They serve 25 million people a day, and 85% of the American population visits an outlet at least once a year. It\u2019s also an enduring symbol of Americana across the world, and the fact that Russia had lost the Cold War was confirmed when the first McDonald\u2019s opened in Moscow in 1990. Much like NASCAR or WWE, it\u2019s an American institution that Donald Trump has been associated with for a very long time.After working for fifteen minutes, Trump announced that he had already worked at McDonald\u2019s longer than Harris. Despite Harris\u2019 claim to have worked at a McDonald\u2019s on Central Avenue in Alameda, California during her freshman year at Howard University, the Harris campaign hasn\u2019t been able to show an iota of proof that the event actually took place.There were no pay stubs or any sort of documentation, and the campaign has refused to let any friend or family member of Kamala Harris speak about her memories of her time at McDonald\u2019s. Recently, the Nostradamus-like data analyst Nate Silver shared 24 reasons he believed Donald Trump could win. If he had seen Donald Trump\u2019s performance at McDonald\u2019s, he might have been tempted to add a 25th.Top 10 US Election Must Reads:",

A new Reuters/Ipsos poll on Tuesday shows Harris with a slim national lead over Trump in an incredibly close election race, while a top Harris advisor says each of the seven battleground states could be decided by a single percentage point.\n\nAn exclusive USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll released Monday puts Harris at 45%, Trump at 44%, a closer race than the poll found in August.\n\nKeep up with the USA TODAY Network's live coverage of the 2024 election.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nRepublicans lose bid to revive Georgia ballot hand-count rule ahead of Nov. 5 election\n\nThe Georgia Supreme Court rejected an emergency appeal from Republicans to get seven rules, including a requirement for thousands of poll workers to hand count ballots, reinstated in the final weeks before the election.\n\nThe decision likely means none of the rules will be in place on Nov. 5 \u2013 Election Day.\n\nThe ballot hand-count rule was one of seven new rules struck down by trial Judge Thomas A. Cox Jr., who said in an Oct. 16 decision that the Georgia State Election Board lacked authority to pass the rules. The hand-count rule in particular has garnered widespread criticism from election workers and officials, who have warned it could undermine public confidence in the election and set fatigued workers up to miss the state's Nov. 12 county certification deadline.\n\nGeorgia Republican Party Chairman Josh McKoon called the state high court's decision \"supremely disappointing\" in a statement posted on X. \"We will press our appeal next year and hope for sanity to prevail.\"\n\n\u2013 Aysha Bagchi\n\nObama: Trump's mismanagement of COVID cost lives\n\nFormer President Barack Obama suggested Tuesday that thousands of Americans who died of COVID might still be alive if Donald Trump hadn\u2019t badly mismanaged the deadly pandemic.\n\nSpeaking at a campaign rally for Vice President Kamala Harris in Detroit, Obama said that when he left office in 2017, he handed Trump, his successor, a playbook for how to deal with a pandemic. Trump trashed it, he said.\n\nCOVID, which has killed 1.2 million Americans, would have been a crisis regardless of who was president, Obama said. But Canada\u2019s per capita death rate from the virus was 60% lower than the United States\u2019, he said, suggesting that more than 600,000 American deaths could have been prevented.\n\n\u201cThat's people's grandparents, people's parents, co-workers, friends,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of those folks might be alive if we had a competent president who actually was paying attention and doing their homework and actually trying to make things better as opposed to telling people go ahead and inject bleach.\u201d\n\nAt his own rally Tuesday night in Greensboro, North Carolina, Trump lashed out at Obama, calling him \u201ca real jerk\u201d and a \u201cdivider.\u201d\n\nHarris reaffirms support for Biden\n\nHarris continued her defense of Biden in an interview with NBC Tuesday, saying she would not take back her support of the president\u2019s acuity in the wake of his campaign-ending debate performance in June.\n\n\u201cIt was a bad debate. People have bad debates,\u201d Harris told NBC\u2019s Hallie Jackson.\n\nIn his debate with Trump over the summer, Biden struggled with a hoarse voice, at times stumbling over words and appearing to lose his train of thought. The performance fueled widespread backlash, including from Democratic allies, and ultimately led to Biden\u2019s exit from the race.\n\nHarris, who defended Biden at the time, then became the Democratic presidential nominee.\n\nSaying she has worked \u201chours and hours and hours\u201d with Biden as vice president, Harris maintained that the president is \u201caccomplished, experienced and capable in every way.\"\n\n\u201cI speak with not only sincerity but with a real firsthand account of watching him do this work,\u201d she said Tuesday. \u201cI have no reluctance in saying that.\u201d\n\n- Savannah Kuchar\n\nSexism not to blame for 2024 election gender gap, Harris says\n\nKamala Harris rejected the idea that sexism could be a negative factor for her campaign, in an interview with NBC News on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI will never assume that anyone in our country should elect a leader based on their gender or their race,\u201d the vice president added. \u201cInstead that that leader needs to earn the vote based on substance.\u201d\n\nFormer President Barack Obama during a stop at a Pittsburgh campaign office this month suggested misogyny was to blame for Harris\u2019 slipping support among men, specifically Black men. In a USA TODAY/Suffolk University survey released Monday, Harris held a 17-point lead among women, while Trump had an inverse advantage with men by 16 percentage points.\n\nHarris told NBC she believes Americans are \u201cabsolutely\u201d ready for a woman and a woman of color to be president. But from the campaign trail, she has said little about potentially being this historic first.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m a clearly a woman,\u201d Harris said Tuesday, laughing. \u201cI don\u2019t need to point that out to anyone.\u201d\n\n\u2212 Savannah Kuchar\n\nHarris ready for Trump to declare victory before all votes are counted\n\nKamala Harris said her campaign is preparing for the possibility that Donald Trump will declare victory before all votes are counted and a winner is projected.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got two weeks to go, and I'm very much grounded in the present in terms of the task at hand,\u201d Harris said Tuesday in an interview with Hallie Jackson of NBC News. \u201cWe will deal with election night and the days after, as they come, and we have the resources and the expertise and the focus on that as well.\u201d\n\nTrump refused to concede the 2020 election, which he lost to Democrat Joe Biden, and filed multiple unsuccessful lawsuits to overturn the results. He still claims falsely that the election was stolen.\n\n\u201cThis is a person, Donald Trump, who tried to undo a free and fair election, who still denies the will of the people, who incited a violent mob to attack the United States Capitol and 140 law enforcement officers were attacked. Some were killed,\u201d Harris said. \u201cThis is a serious matter. The American people are, at this point, two weeks out, being presented with a very, very serious decision about what will be the future of our country.\u201d\n\n\u2013Michael Collins\n\nHarris says she does not believe in \u2018concessions\u2019 on abortion\n\nHarris suggested that she would not compromise on protecting abortion rights, in an interview with NBC News Tuesday evening.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we should be making concessions when we\u2019re talking about a fundamental freedom to make decisions about your own body,\u201d Harris told NBC\u2019s Hallie Jackson.\n\nWhen pressed whether she would offer more moderate Republicans, such as Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, an \u201colive branch\u201d on the issue, Harris said she was \u201cnot going to engage in hypotheticals.\u201d\n\nReproductive rights have been central to Harris\u2019 campaign, as abortion is likely to be top of mind for many voters in the first presidential election since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. The vice president will be in Texas Friday, in a state with some of the country\u2019s most restrictive abortion laws, talking about the \u201cconsequences of these bans on women\u2019s lives,\u201d according to her campaign.\n\n\u2212 Savannah Kuchar\n\nTulsi Gabbard joins Republican party\n\nFormer Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, said she is joining the Republican party, making the announcement during a Trump rally in North Carolina Tuesday evening.\n\n\u201cIt is because of my love for our country and specifically because of the leadership that President Trump has brought to transform the Republican party and bring it back to the party of the people and the party of peace,\u201d Gabbard said on stage alongside Trump.\n\nGabbard served in Congress from 2013 to 2021 as a member of the Democratic party and ran in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary. In 2022, she announced she would be leaving the party but did not mention at the time plans to join another.\n\nGabbard endorsed Trump\u2019s 2024 bid for the White House and is a part of the former president\u2019s transition team.\n\n- Savannah Kuchar\n\nEx-chief of staff: Trump fits the definition of 'fascist'\n\nFormer White House Chief of Staff John Kelly is speaking out on his ex-boss Trump - and it's not very flattering.\n\nIn interviews with The New York Times, Kelly said the former president exhibits the tendencies of a fascist, including his threat to possibly use the military against domestic political opponents.\n\n\u201cWell, looking at the definition of fascism: It\u2019s a far-right authoritarian, ultranationalist political ideology and movement characterized by a dictatorial leader, centralized autocracy, militarism, forcible suppression of opposition, belief in a natural social hierarchy,\u201d Kelly said.\n\nHe added: \u201cSo certainly, in my experience, those are the kinds of things that he thinks would work better in terms of running America . . . So he certainly falls into the general definition of fascist, for sure.\u201d\n\nKelly also confirmed reports that Trump has spoken positively about German dictator Adolf Hitler.\u201cHe commented more than once that, \u2018You know, Hitler did some good things, too,\u2019\u201d Kelly told The Times.\n\nOver the years, Kelly said that Trump has denigrated wounded warriors and dead soldiers as \"losers\" and \"suckers,\" mostly according to reports that relied on anonymous sources.\n\nGoing on the record with The New York Times, Kelly said: \u201cIn many cases, I would agree with some of his policies ... But again, it\u2019s a very dangerous thing to have the wrong person elected to high office.\u201d\n\nTrump has denied Kelly's criticisms.\n\n\"John Kelly, by far the dumbest of my Military people, just picked up the theme of the Radical Left\u2019s lying about Gold Star Families and Soldiers, in his hatred of me,\" Trump said in a Truth Social post last month. \"He was incapable of doing a good job, it was too much for him, and I couldn\u2019t stand the guy, so I fired him like a 'dog.'\"\n\n- David Jackson\n\nObama hits \u2018older, loonier Donald Trump\u2019\n\nFormer President Barack Obama questioned Donald Trump at a Harris campaign rally Tuesday in Madison, Wisconsin, warning that the country can\u2019t afford an \u201colder, loonier Donald Trump.\u201d\n\n\"There are questions about his competence. I mean, he\u2019s out there giving two-hour speeches. It's like Fidel Castro -- just keeps on talking. It's just word salads,\u201d Obama said. The former president, who has been hitting the campaign trail for Harris ahead of Election Day Nov. 5, said he voted early by mail Monday from his hometown of Chicago.\n\nObama, joined at the rally by Harris' running mate Tim Walz, mocked Trump for a campaign town hall last week that turned into a music concert, of sorts, as Trump stood on the stage for 39 minutes while some of his favorite songs played over the venue\u2019s sound system.\n\n\u201cHe decided, no I\u2019m not going to answer questions anymore. Let\u2019s just play music for half an hour,\u201d Obama said. \u201cSo, he\u2019s standing there, and he\u2019s swaying to \u2018Ave Maria,\u2019 and \u2018YMCA.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe added: \"Can you imagine if Tim did that, or Kamala did that, or I did that? Now our playlist would be better. But you would say to yourself, this is odd behavior. He calls himself the \u2018father of IVF.\u2019 I have no idea what that means. You don\u2019t either.\u201d\n\n\u2212Joey Garrison\n\nEminem introduces Obama at Harris rally in Detroit\n\nRapper and Detroit native Eminem took the stage Tuesday to briefly address the Michigan crowd and introduce former President Barack Obama.\n\nEminem, who has not formally endorsed a presidential candidate in previous elections, said he wants people to feel free to express opinions without being \u201cworried about retribution.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think Vice President Harris supports a future for this country where these freedoms and many others will be protected and upheld,\u201d Eminem said, before turning over the stage to Obama.\n\n- Savannah Kuchar\n\nBiden mocks Trump\u2019s \u2018concept\u2019 of a plan to replace Obamacare\n\nPresident Joe Biden poked fun at Donald Trump on Tuesday for claiming he has \u201cconcepts\u201d of a plan to replace Obamacare.\n\nBiden, speaking in Concord, New Hampshire, touted his administration\u2019s work to lower the cost of prescriptions drugs, such as insulin. At one point, he noted sarcastically that \u201cmy predecessor, the distinguished former president\u201d has threatened to repeal the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare, a landmark health care law in effect for nearly 15 years. Trump doesn\u2019t actually have a plan to replace the law, Biden said, he has just a \u201cconcept of a plan.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe has no concept of anything,\u201d Biden said. \u201cNo plan.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s dig is rooted in comments Trump made during a debate with Kamala Harris in September. Trump said he has \u201cconcepts\u201d of a plan to replace the health care law but offered no details.\n\n\u2013Michael Collins\n\nVance makes joke about Harris 'trying to steal' election at rally\n\nSen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, appeared in Arizona Tuesday, addressing a crowd of supporters from behind a wooden lectern with a \u201cTrump Vance\u201d campaign sign taped to the front.\n\nWhile making his pitch encouraging residents to get out and vote, the tape seemingly gave way and the sign fell off. And Vance quickly pointed fingers.\n\n\u201cKamala Harris put that sign up, ladies and gentlemen,\u201d Vance joked. \u201cShe\u2019s already trying to steal the 2024 election.\u201d The Ohio senator quickly resumed giving the end of his speech.\n\nDonald Trump for years has made false claims of fraud about the 2020 election, and the former president and his running mate have often refused to say Trump lost the election to President Joe Biden.\n\n\u2013 Savannah Kuchar\n\nTim Walz accuses Elon Musk of helping Donald Trump \u2018buy an election\u2019\n\nWalz accused Trump of lacking \u201cthe stamina\u201d to serve a second presidency, continuing the Harris campaign's line of attack questioning Trump\u2019s fitness for the job.\n\n\u201cIt takes stamina to run for president. It takes stamina to be president. Donald Trump does not have stamina,\u201d Walz say at the campaign rally in Madison, Wisconsin.\n\nWalz also took a jab at billionaire businessman Elon Musk, who Walz referred to as Trump\u2019s \u201crunning-mate.\u201d\n\n\u201cElon is on that stage, jumping around,,\" Walz said. \u201cThat guy is literally the richest man in the world spending millions of dollars to help Donald Trump buy an election.\"\n\nMusk promised on Saturday to give away $1 million each day until November's election to someone who signs his online petition, with the first prize awarded at a PAC event supporting Republican Donald Trump.\n\n\u2013 Joey Garrison, Reuters\n\nWalz mocks Trump\u2019s McDonald's appearance: \u2018Ronald wears less make-up\u2019\n\nDemocratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz mocked Donald Trump\u2019s appearance at the drive-thru line of a McDonald's in Pennsylvania earlier this week, calling it a \u201ccruel\u201d stunt to Americans whose livelihoods depend on working at the fast-food chain.\n\n\u201cHe went to a McDonalds and dressed up as a drive-thru worker. They found him an apron his size and put it on him,\u201d Walz said at campaign rally in Madison, Wisconsin, where he was joined by former President Barack Obama.\n\n\u201cLook, there's something not just nuts, but cruel about feeling better using people's livelihood as a political prop,\u201d he said. \u201cHis agenda lets big corporations not pay people overtime and diminishes those very works who he was cosplaying at.\u201d\n\nWalz then quipped: \u201cBeing at McDonalds, he looked much more like Ronald McDonald than the clown that he actually is,\u201d Walz said. \u201cAnd Ronald wears less makeup.\u201d\n\n\u201cKamala actually worked at McDonald's and did that job,\u201d Walz added. Trump without evidence has accused Harris of lying about working part-time at a McDonald to help pay for expenses during college. The fast food giant has not responded to inquiries about Trump's accusations.\n\n\u2013 Joey Garrison\n\nDonald Trump cancels virtual event with RFK Jr., Tulsi Gabbard\n\nTrump may have mocked Harris for staying off the campaign trail Tuesday, but he canceled an event of his own as well.\n\nThe Republican candidate was set to do a \"virtual town hall\" on health issues with two prominent endorsers, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., and former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, but the campaign canceled the event because of scheduling changes.\n\nTrump and Harris have repeatedly traded jabs in recent weeks about calling off events. Trump \u2013 who noted this morning that Harris is off the trail today, although she is sitting for a pair of television interviews \u2013 has said that he has as much energy these days as he has ever had.\n\nTrump hosted an Hispanic roundtable this morning in Doral, Fla., and holds a rally tonight in Greensboro, North Carolina.\n\n\u2013 David Jackson\n\nJudge orders seizure of Rudy Giuliani\u2019s property, but not World Series rings\n\nRudy Giuliani \u2013 or at least his son Andrew \u2013 gets to keep his three World Series rings. For now.\n\nU.S. District Judge Lewis Liman ordered Giuliani on Tuesday to surrender his property to settle a $145 million civil judgment for defaming two Georgia election workers after the 2020 election by saying they stuffed ballot boxes.\n\nThe belongings at stake include a luxury New York apartment on Madison Avenue and a $2 million claim for legal fees against Donald Trump and the Republican National Committee.\n\nLiman ruled that seizing the property would make it easier for election workers Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss to sell them. Giuliani had asked to delay trying to collect the legal fees from Trump until Nov. 6 to avoid influencing the election with \u201cinaccurate\u201d claims sparking a \u201cmedia frenzy,\u201d a proposal Liman rejected.\n\nThe judge said the ownership of the former New York mayor\u2019s World Series rings will be determined separately, after his son Andrew Giuliani claimed he was given the rings in 2018.\n\n\u2013 Bart Jansen\n\nDonald Trump to appear on Joe Rogan podcast\n\nDonald Trump is set to appear on \"The Joe Rogan Experience,\" one of the most popular podcasts in America. Trump will sit Friday for the interview, which comes after the former president has appeared on other podcasts such as Theo Von's \"This Past Weekend.\"\n\nKamala Harris has also made her fair share of podcast appearances, including an interview on \"Call Her Daddy\" that focused on abortion access and other reproductive rights debates.\n\n\u2013 David Jackson and Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhen will the election results be announced?\n\nIt is not clear exactly when the election results will be announced, as the timing depends on a variety of factors. Each state handles its elections differently, ranging from weeks-long early voting to strict voter ID laws.\n\nBut you can anticipate delays.\n\nSome key swing states that Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are vying for, like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, aren't permitted to start processing absentee and mail-in ballots until Election Day, which is expected to slow down the count.\n\n\u2013 Sudiksha Kochi and Sam Woodward\n\nThe power of third-party candidates:Here's how they could play a pivotal role on Election Day\n\nEminem to introduce Obama at Detroit rally\n\nSlim Shady is hitting the campaign trail.\n\nEminem is set to introduce former President Barack Obama during a rally in Detroit on Tuesday, according to multiple reports. The rapper, who grew up in Detroit, has long criticized Donald Trump, even releasing a freestyle rap mocking the former president in 2017.\n\nA slate of musicians have backed Harris' White House bid, from Billie Eilish and Taylor Swift to Bruce Springsteen. Beyonce\u0301 gave Harris her blessing to use her song, \"Freedom\" as an unofficial campaign anthem.\n\n\u2013 Marina Pitofsky\n\nTrump chats up Hispanic supporters - and bashes Harris\n\nDonald Trump used a roundtable event focused on Hispanic voters Tuesday to praise an important voting bloc and remind people that he is on the campaign trail today \u2013 unlike Harris.\n\n\"Who the hell takes off when you have 14 days left?\" Trump said during the event in Doral, Fla.\n\nHarris does have two media interviews on Tuesday, with NBC and Telemundo, as well as her vice presidential duties. \"She will receive briefings and conduct internal meetings with staff,\" her schedule says.\n\nMeanwhile, the Doral event featured Hispanic supporters who praised Trump \u2013 and vice-versa.\n\n\"It's an incredible community,\" Trump said.\n\n\u2013 David Jackson\n\nIs Election Day a federal holiday?\n\nElection Day is not a federal holiday.\n\nBut some states do observe Election Day as a holiday. State offices will be closed on Nov 5. in Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Montana, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Virginia and West Virginia.\n\nTwenty-four states, plus the District of Columbia, offer paid time off to vote. Some states offer time off for voting but with no pay, including Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Massachusetts and Wisconsin.\n\n\u2013 Olivia Munson\n\nTrump campaign selling t-shirts off McDonald\u2019s visit\n\nAfter creating a viral moment on Sunday by sporting an apron and working as a fry cooker at a McDonald's in Pennsylvania, the former president's campaign is now selling \"MAGADonald's\" t-shirts.\n\n\"I have a McGift for you!\" the campaign's online gift shop says above a t-shirt featuring a photo of Trump leaning out a drive-thru window.\n\nThe visit was called a stunt by some critics, but it was part of a larger effort by the Trump campaign to undermine Vice President Kamala Harris and her appeals to working-class and middle-class voters, specifically how she emphasized working at the $225 billion fast food chain in college.\n\n-- Phillip Bailey\n\nSpringsteen, Obama to headline concerts for Harris in Atlanta, Philly\n\nWith two weeks left until Election Day on Nov. 5, Kamala Harris is getting a boost from \u201cThe Boss.\u201d\n\nMusic icon Bruce Springsteen will headline a series of concerts for Harris during the homestretch of the campaign, beginning with concerts Thursday in Atlanta and Monday in Philadelphia, the Harris campaign confirmed.\n\nSpringsteen, a longtime Democratic activist, will be joined by former President Barack Obama at both shows, with Harris scheduled to attend the Atlanta concert.\n\nThe Harris campaign is billing the concert series, dubbed \u201cWhen we vote, we win,\u201d as part of its get-out-the-vote strategy amid the early-voting period before the Nov. 5 election. Additional concerts are set to be announced in the coming days.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nTop Harris adviser says every battleground could come down to 1 point or less\n\nTop Harris campaign adviser David Plouffe said the seven battlegrounds that will decide the election could each be decided by less than 1 percentage point and suggested Trump is likely to top his past performances in the popular vote.\n\n\u201cHistorically, it would be unusual to have seven states come down to a point or less,\u201d Plouffe said on CNN. \u201cBut I think at this point, you have to assume that\u2019s a distinct possibility.\u201d\n\nHarris and Trump are running neck and neck in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada. President Joe Biden won each except North Carolina in 2020.\n\nTrump finished with 46.1% in the popular vote in the 2016 election he won over Hillary Clinton. He received 46.8% of the national vote in his Electoral College loss against Biden in 2020.\n\nPlouffe, who was Barack Obama\u2019s campaign manager in 2008, acknowledged Trump could reach a higher bar nationally this year.\n\n\u201cDemocrats wish Donald Trump wouldn\u2019t get more than 46% of the vote,\u201d Plouffe told CNN, adding that in the battleground states, \u201cthat\u2019s not reality. He\u2019s going to get up to 48% in all of these states. And so we just have to make sure we\u2019re hitting our win number, which depending on the state, could be 50, could be 49.5.\u201d\n\n\u2212 Joey Garrison\n\nHarris will talk abortion rights in Texas on Friday\n\nVice President Harris will travel on Friday to Texas, home to some of the most restrictive abortion laws in the country, to talk about the \u201cconsequences of these bans on women\u2019s lives,\u201d according to her campaign.\n\nHarris will appear with Rep. Colin Allred, who's challenging Republican Sen. Ted Cruz.\n\nOne of Harris\u2019 top surrogates on reproductive freedom has been Texas resident Amanda Zurawski, who almost died of sepsis after being denied an abortion and who led a lawsuit against Texas\u2019 abortion bans.\n\n\u2212Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nMore:Harris leads Trump 2-1 among the earliest voters, many driven by abortion access\n\nRepublican former officials call for probe of Elon Musk's $1 million petition prizes\n\nFormer Republican lawmakers, Justice Department officials and advisors have asked Attorney General Merrick Garland to investigate whether it\u2019s illegal for billionaire Elon Musk to be handing out $1 million cash prizes to swing state voters if they sign his political organization\u2019s petition.\n\nThe letter, sent Monday to Garland, argues that the prizes established by Musk as part of his effort to help elect former President Donald Trump, violate laws make it illegal to pay people for registering to vote.\n\n\u201cWe are aware of nothing like this in modern political history,\u201d says the letter, which was signed by 11 former Republican officials.\n\n\u2212 Josh Meyer\n\nMore:Former GOP officials ask DOJ to probe Elon Musk $1 million giveaways to pro-Trump voters\n\nWhat are Kamala Harris\u2019 religious views?\n\nHarris identifies as a Baptist \u2212 a major Protestant Christian denomination. She told the Associated Press in 2020 that she attends services at the Third Baptist Church of San Francisco.\n\nBut her religious background is quite mixed. Her father is a Christian while her mother was a Hindu. Harris' husband, Doug Emhoff, is Jewish.\n\n\u2212 Sudiksha Kochi\n\nMore:Voters Guide 2024: Where Harris and Trump stand on key issues\n\nHarris targets Latino men with small biz boot camps and a pledge to hire more police\n\nVice President Kamala Harris released a new slate of proposals on Tuesday aimed at helping Latino men get ahead economically.\n\nHarris said she\u2019d push for legislation allowing construction workers and apprentices to write off tools and other equipment on their taxes, which her campaign estimates would affect 2 million people.\n\nThe vice president said he would fund \u201chigh-quality bilingual education and English language acquisition programs\u201d and increase the number of college and career counselors in lower income schools, while funding small business boot camps for aspiring entrepreneurs.\n\nBuried in the plan are promises to \u201cend the shortage of police officers\" by hiring 100,000 more nationwide.\n\n\u2013 Francesca Chambers\n\nElection Day is Nov. 5. Sign up for USA TODAY's On Politics newsletter for breaking news and exclusive analysis.\n\nThe campaign is stressful - but no gummies for Harris\n\nPresidential elections are stressful, but Vice President Kamala Harris says she's not using one potential wellness technique to temper anxiety during her presidential campaign: marijuana edibles.\n\nThe topic arose at a town hall-style exchange between Harris and journalist Maria Shriver on Monday in Royal Oak, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit.\n\n\"Everybody I talk to says you know, 'I have to turn off the news \u2212 I can\u2019t read anything, I\u2019m meditating, I\u2019m doing yoga.

Numerous national and state polls show that the 2024 race is very tight with both candidates essentially neck and neck.\n\nThe Harris and Trump campaign have been pushing out more events and interviews in the final two-week stretch.\n\n\u2212 Sudiksha Kochi\n\nTrump's 'mass deportation' promise\n\nIf he returns to the White House, Donald Trump has vowed to launch a \u201cmass deportation\u201d of at least 11 million immigrants living in the U.S. without authorization.\n\nHe made a similar promise during his first administration. It didn\u2019t pan out after he hit logistical and legal obstacles. Next time, experts say, things may be different.\n\nA new USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll found 45% of respondents support Trump\u2019s mass deportation proposal and 49% oppose it, with 4% undecided. The poll of 1,000 likely voters, taken by landline and cellphone Oct. 14 to 18, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.\n\nA second, more experienced Trump administration will know \"how to effectively use an enormous bureaucracy to their advantage,\" said Ce\u0301sar Garci\u0301a Herna\u0301ndez, an Ohio State University law professor and author of \"Migrating to Prison: America\u2019s Obsession with Locking Up Immigrants.\"\n\n\u2212 Lauren Villagran, Bart Jansen and Aysha Bagchi\n\nMore:Donald Trump has promised a 'mass deportation.'

In Real Clear Politics' average of 2024 surveys, Harris leads Trump by just 0.9 percentage points.\n\nIt's even closer in some of the crucial swing states, such as Arizona, Michigan and Pennsylvania. For example, Trump leads Harris by 0.2 percentage points in the polling average of Wisconsin surveys.\n\n\u2013 Marina Pitofsky\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of misinformation out there.

Depending on where you live, you can vote early either by mail or in person. You can also wait to go to a polling location on Nov. 5, which is Election Day, to cast your ballot.\n\nUSA TODAY has a breakdown of when early voting has started or will begin in the states. The first state in the country to begin voting was Alabama, which sent around absentee ballots on Sept. 11. Alabama does not have an option for in-person early voting.\n\nSeven states are expected to open up options for in-person early voting or in-person absentee early voting on Monday, including Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Idaho, South Carolina and Texas.\n\n\u2013 Sudiksha Kochi and Fernando Cervantes Jr.",

        "text": "Monday, October 21, 2024\nIt\u2019s Monday, October 21st, 2024.\n\nI\u2019m Albert Mohler, and this is The Briefing, a daily analysis of news and events from a Christian worldview.\n\nPart I\n\nThe Media Are Doing U.S. Citizens a Disservice in Their Reporting on Israel: Israel\u2019s Only Option Remains Its Self-Preservation\n\nWe have to start today in Israel. And the big question in Israel is, what comes next? That what comes next is a big question, and what could be an even bigger question. The big question, immediately, is what is Israel going to do in response to the attack by Iran? The second time in just a matter of the last several months that there has been a direct attack upon Israel by Iran, and Israel will not let this go unanswered. What exactly Israel does in response? Well, time will tell.\n\nThe second thing, which is a bigger question, is what comes next when it comes to the battle against Hamas and Hezbollah? And in both of those cases, here is where I think the Western media are failing Americans and others in the West in trying to interpret these issues. For example, here from Saturday\u2019s edition of the New York Times, a headline, \u201cIts Ruthless Leader is Gone, but Hamas is not likely to relent.\u201d Well, absolutely right. Another headline on the same page, \u201cHamas says, its Demands are Unchanged as Biden Pushes for a Ceasefire.\u201d Again, that makes sense. \u201cEven after death of Hamas Leader, Mideast Peace May still be Elusive,\u201d another headline, \u201cOn the Run, Hurt, Yet Ever Defiant,\u201d that\u2019s about the last hours and days of Yahya Sinwar, the head of Hamas who was killed by Israeli forces last Thursday.\n\nSo, you look at this and you recognize it\u2019s not so much what they\u2019re saying as what they\u2019re not saying that is the problem. I want to look particularly at that duo of stories that ran over the weekend in the New York Times. One headline, \u201cHamas is not likely to relent.\u201d The other, \u201cHamas says its demands are unchanged as Biden pushes for a ceasefire.\u201d It\u2019s not that I found any errors in these reports. And frankly, the reports are of the quality that you would expect from a newspaper like the New York Times. It\u2019s a very liberal newspaper, but what it has as an asset is a base of professional reporters all over the world, a network of reporters all over the world that no other paper can match.\n\nAnd this is one of the differences between, say, watching cable news and reading a paper of this kind of substance. There\u2019s just a lot more information in the paper. This is a lot more information, especially in the print edition of the paper. There\u2019s a reason why the Sunday edition of the New York Times weighs so much. That is to say the paper edition. Online, not so much.\n\nAll right. So, the article by a team of reporters that had the headline, \u201cHamas says its demands are unchanged,\u201d here\u2019s how the New York Times summarizes those demands. The demands are that Israel will stop what\u2019s described here as its onslaught in Gaza, \u201cas well as its complete withdrawal from the territory and the release of Palestinian prisoners in Israel.\u201d\n\nNow, here\u2019s what we have to notice. It\u2019s not that that\u2019s wrong, it\u2019s that is woefully incomplete. What we know about the demands of Hamas that are unchanged, the demands aren\u2019t only those for a ceasefire. We have to remember that Hamas has been about a deadly attack against Israel. And its basic demand is not that Israel negotiate, but that Israel cease to exist. The same thing is true for Hamas, that is the Shia group that is, of course, mostly located in Gaza, also very influential in the West Bank. It also applies to Hezbollah, the Shiite group mostly now in Lebanon, launching deadly attacks against Israel as well.\n\nYou look at this and you recognize, what needs to be repeated over and over again in the press coverage of Israel\u2019s fight against Hezbollah in the north and Hamas right there on the Gaza Strip and, at least, with influence in the West Bank, and furthermore, the Houthi rebels there in Yemen, and also, ultimately, Iran, the evil power behind what they call the axis of opposition, we need to understand that Israel is facing existential threats all around. You just look at a clock, you look at a map, and all the way around, Israel is facing existential threats.\n\nThe second thing that isn\u2019t often mentioned is the fact that it is simply untrue that Hezbollah and Hamas are governments. They\u2019re not governments, they are terrorist organizations. They function, of course, with press offices and with all the rest that comes with some kind of quasi-governmental entity. But they are not recognized as governments. They\u2019re certainly not recognized as states. So, when there is some equality or even some kind of parallelism that, say, is comparing Israel with Hamas or Israel with Hezbollah, that is a fundamental error. But the American media back into these all the time.\n\nAnd so, I did say carefully there, I think, sometimes, the major media in the United States back into this because they are so trained to say on the one hand, and on the other hand, here\u2019s one source on this side, here\u2019s a source on that side. And to be honest, in terms of adequate news coverage, you\u2019ve got to get those voices in. For one thing, it is impossible to understand what\u2019s going on in any of these fronts if you don\u2019t have first-hand reports from the people involved about why they\u2019re doing this. But when you, then, go to say Israel\u2019s leader and then the leader of Hamas, you imply a parallelism. And that just does not exist. When you have a failure of self-government, such as is true in Gaza, then these terrorist group, these militias step in. Hezbollah effectively in control of southern Lebanon, Hamas effectively and, indeed indubitably, in control there in Gaza.\n\nSo, where does Israel go next? Well, for one thing, it has to recognize what the American people just aren\u2019t reminded of enough, and that is that these groups want the extinction of Israel. They\u2019re not just looking for territorial concessions, they\u2019re not just looking for a prisoner release. They\u2019re looking for all those things, of course. They\u2019re not just looking for self-determination for some province outside of Israel. They want Israel.\n\nNow, one of the major journalistic issues right now is that you have so many reporters, so many media sources saying the people of Gaza deserve better. True or false, do the people of Gaza deserve better? Well, in general terms, the answer has to be yes. They deserve far better than what they have received. They have been horribly affected by Israel\u2019s war against Hamas. And by horribly, I mean horribly. The suffering there in Gaza is frankly unspeakable. You are looking at the deaths of civilians and you\u2019re looking at the deaths, even, of infants and children. And that is largely because Hamas embedded itself, just as Hezbollah embeds itself in the north, they embed themselves among civilians. And as we saw in the case of Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas chief who was just killed last week, he acknowledged openly that it was his moral strategy, not just his military strategy, it was his moral strategy, to embed his militia and terrorist organization with the civilian population because he wanted the civilian population to suffer just as his troops or his militia would suffer. That\u2019s directly from his own argument.\n\nSo, one of the big questions right now is, do we see an opening for some kind of ceasefire, much less, for some kind of more abiding peace or settlement there in the Middle East? Does Israel now face a moment of decision when it can simply pull back? Well, the point of these headlines coming from even liberal media is, no, Israel can\u2019t do that. You don\u2019t have, for instance, the American administration saying that as clearly as it should. Israel is facing an existential threat. Hamas has simply said, \u201cOkay, you can kill Yahya Sinwar. We will be back with more. We\u2019re not changing our plans. We\u2019re not changing our aims.\u201d Hezbollah said, you can kill Hassan Nasrallah. You can kill their military leader,\u201d which Israel did just in recent weeks. But they say, \u201cIt is not going to deter us. We\u2019re going to be right back in the battle. We will show up with an even newly increased intensity.\u201d\n\nAnd so, is this an opening for peace? Well, if it is, it doesn\u2019t appear to be one at the moment. What I keep calling for is a bit of candor, indeed, a lot more candor coming from the American government. Now, I will tell you, the American government on the ground in terms of policy actually seems to be operating better than would be implied by a lot of public statements. I\u2019m glad of that. I mentioned last week that the U.S. has moved a major missile defense system into Israel with about 100 U.S. military personnel. That is an incredibly loud statement. I guarantee you it\u2019s being heard in Iran. It\u2019s being heard by Hamas and Hezbollah. And I want to give the Biden administration credit for doing that.\n\nIt needs, however, to be more clear, just as is also the case, I would argue in the situation, in Ukraine with Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. The administration, any administration, a future administration after the November election, needs to be incredibly clear with the American people and honest with the world that there are limited options in these situations. And then, when it comes to Israel, Israel is going to defend itself. You can put a period at the end of that. Full stop, Israel is going to defend itself.\n\nNot only that, as I have argued, the United States depends not only upon Israel defending itself but Israel defending our interest in the region. It is simply not the case that it\u2019s just friendship, as is represented by that new missile system, missile defense system, and those American personnel on the ground. The United States has its own interests in the entire region. We can\u2019t help but to have our own interests. And that includes our own self-defense, given attacks even on the continental United States, for instance, in September 11, coming from the cauldron of the Middle East. The United States is involved in this, whether we like it or not, whether we acknowledge it or not. And I think the American people would be well-served by an administration that explained the situation more honestly.\n\nAnd I\u2019ll just say that, at least, as I can see it, applied to this electoral cycle, the problem is that Kamala Harris won\u2019t say the right thing. I think she might do the right thing, in many cases, but she won\u2019t say the right thing. And thus, that really blunts the effectiveness of American action. I think it\u2019s more likely that former President Trump, if re-elected, would say the right thing. I want to tell you upfront, he will say it very simplistically. I will wish, I can anticipate, that President Trump would do a better job of explaining what he\u2019s thinking and what he does. But in terms of the interest of Israel, I think, well, Israel\u2019s sending every signal that it does understand what is at stake. And that\u2019s one of the reasons why I think it is clear that the Netanyahu government certainly hopes for a Trump election in November. And given what Israel\u2019s experiencing right now, that\u2019s a pretty loud testimony.\n\nPart II\n\nThe Christian Worldview Does Not Honor Surrogacy: The Principle of Alienation and the Massive Moral Risk of Our Modern Rent-A-Womb Industry\n\nOkay, we\u2019ll come back to the United States in just a moment, but I want to turn from the Middle East to Italy, because just in the last several days there has been a lot of news coverage about legislation adopted by Italy\u2019s government related to the criminalization of surrogate parenthood, of surrogacy, as it is known. Now, as you look at this, you recognize that previous generations would not know what we\u2019re talking about. The very concept of a surrogate mother or a surrogate parent would have been only a legal fiction. If you were to go back a matter of years, it would mean someone standing in the place of a mother or someone standing in the place of a parent. Not what it means anymore. No.\n\nNow, we\u2019re looking at a situation in which surrogacy refers to the fact that some human gametes are used, often donor gametes, which is to say sometimes it\u2019s egg and sperm bought in some kind of laboratory context. Sometimes, it is the donation of one or the other or both. Wow, let\u2019s just go down the list and say that involves the transfer of an embryo into the womb of someone who is not the biological mother of the child. That person is hired to carry that child through pregnancy to birth. And then that person recedes. And the persons who paid the other side of the contract get the baby.\n\nNow, from a Christian perspective, there are all kinds of problems here. So, we\u2019re not even getting to the LGBTQ stuff yet. That\u2019s on the front line. That\u2019s the very first paragraph of most news coverage. But let\u2019s just not go there yet. Let\u2019s just look at the technology. Let\u2019s remind ourselves of what the Christian worldview has to say about such a thing. Number one, it\u2019s a good thing to want a baby. Bible\u2019s clear about that. It\u2019s a good thing to want a baby. But the second thing the Bible says is that there is a context in which a baby should be conceived, in which a baby should be born. That context is marriage. And that means that context of marriage is always definitively non-negotiably, the union of a man and a woman, period.\n\nSo, let\u2019s just say, without question, that, from the Christian worldview, there\u2019s a big problem with hiring someone as a rent-a-womb in order to have a baby, so-called \u201chave a baby.\u201d Now, there\u2019s a Christian worldview principle here. I like to refer to it as alienation. And that just means that the further alienated or distant an issue becomes from the context in which God has given it, the more ethical risk is involved.\n\nAnd so, you just look at surrogacy, you say, well, number one, let\u2019s work backwards. If a man and a woman are married and they come together and they make a baby, there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. There can\u2019t be anything wrong with that. The moment you alienate from that context of absolute right in creation order, you bring in greater moral risk. So, even when you have just, say, donor gametes, donor sperm or donor egg, you\u2019ve already created a certain alienation that brings in all kinds of complications, all kinds of moral risk. You add IVF, and you can\u2019t have surrogacy without IVF. All the problems with IVF are just exaggerated and accentuated when it comes to surrogate parenting. So, we have a lot of alienation. Then you pay someone to be, as I said, basically a rent-a-womb, and you pay a woman to carry a baby, which by the way, women say, and we can understand it\u2019s a very emotional process, they develop a relationship with that child within them, and then you take that child away in order to fulfill a contract and you give it to someone else, that\u2019s a problem. And then you know what the big problem is and why this legislation in Italy has made headlines in the United States.\n\nIt is because let\u2019s just put it as simply and straightforwardly as we possibly can. When you have a homosexual male couple, what you do not have anywhere is a womb. What you do not have with a homosexual male couple is any way to have a baby. If you say there is such a thing as \u201cgay marriage,\u201d the marriage you\u2019ve defined against creation order is meaning a man and a man, you still can\u2019t, in any sense, with just the two of them, produce a baby. And so, this is where surrogacy becomes a third party. And when we talk about the moral risk and alienation, it is so graphically displayed that it simply can\u2019t be denied.\n\nPart III\n\nItaly Bans Surrogacy Use by Its Citizens: This is the Right Move by Italy\u2019s Prime Minister and Government\n\nAnd yet, what the government in Italy has done is to respond to that issue, not only outlawing surrogacy in Italy, but outlawing the use of surrogacy elsewhere on the part of Italian citizens. And so, you look at the major media in the United States, they\u2019ve reported on this. They\u2019ve said that it is a part of the government of Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni to satisfy the right wing of Italy\u2019s government and Italy, by the way, sometimes, it\u2019s had a socialist government, but it always has a right wing. There\u2019s a right wing out there, World War II, let\u2019s just remember the right wing of fascism in Italy. And yet here we\u2019re talking about a right wing, which is really right wing in this sense because of the tradition of Catholicism, for example, and Catholic moral teaching and Catholic influence, which, by the way, on these issues mean we are in agreement about the definition of marriage, and we are in agreement about these reproductive moral issues.\n\nSo, many in the West, and this would also include some media in Italy, are saying she\u2019s just trying to pacify the right wing of her party and of the government there in Italy. And I\u2019ll simply say, if so, then good for them. This is where we have to look at reports like this and say, \u201cYou know what? At this point, that is simply the right thing, and whoever\u2019s pushing for it is on this issue on the right side.\u201d And so, I would say to Italy\u2019s prime minister, congratulations.\n\nThe other thing that is being alleged against this legislation in Italy is that it might be unenforceable. And you know it might be. It might be that the government in Italy never comes to know of a situation. But then again, there\u2019s something that\u2019s missing here, and that is, let\u2019s just say you have a homosexual male couple in Italy and they secure against the law some kind of surrogacy elsewhere, well, it still is likely to come to government attention when they bring that baby and need to register that baby, for instance, for school or preschool programs or anything else. They just want to register the legal existence of that child. They\u2019re going to have to explain how that child came to be.\n\nOther critics are saying, \u201cthis is not going to absolutely stop the practice.\u201d Well, there are a lot of things the law doesn\u2019t absolutely stop. But Christians understand, the law is not only a restraint, the law is not only a criminal definition, the law is also a teacher. And in this case, Italy\u2019s legislation is going to teach the right thing, even if not all learn the lesson, the law is righteously teaching.\n\nPart IV\n\nKamala Harris Goes to Church: The Lack of Religion in the \u201824 Presidential Election Highlights the Vast Secularization of the U.S.\n\nWell, as I promised, let\u2019s come back home. And one interesting issue for us to discuss about the 2024 presidential election today is, well, what happened or didn\u2019t happen yesterday when it comes to the major candidates and attending church. And so, in the course of American history, especially as you get this far into an electoral campaign, but frankly, even far earlier in most campaigns, you have presidential candidates who are pretty clear about claiming some kind of specific religious identity. And to be honest, they want to use that politically.\n\nNow, of the two parties, as we have often explained, it\u2019s simply beyond doubt. It\u2019s affirmed by the leadership of both parties that the Republican Party and the Democratic Party are in a different place on this. The Republican Party is more likely to include religious believers and those who have attended church services, some voting specialists, some pollsters say that is the clearest single determinant of voting patterns. That is to say voters who attended church one time in the last month are overwhelmingly likely to vote Republican. The Democratic Party includes more secular people, and its messaging is a good deal more secular. But yesterday, it was the Democratic ticket that made news with both the presidential nominee and the vice presidential nominee, pretty ostentatiously going to church.\n\nNow, this has often not gone well for candidates. When it comes to someone like Former President Trump now running again as the Republican nominee, he rather infamously cited two Corinthians, which, by the way, isn\u2019t wrong, it\u2019s just British. But I don\u2019t think the president understood whether it was British or American or wrong. It was just an indication that he probably hasn\u2019t spent a lot of time lately reading two Corinthians.\n\nFor the current vice president Democratic nominee, the book of the Bible that seems to be the problem is Ecclesiastes, which came out Ecclesiastics. Well, the bottom line is this. You don\u2019t have to look at 2 Corinthians to find out that neither one of these candidates is an ecclesiastic. That is simply a fact. In other words, they\u2019re not church people. And that\u2019s not really headline news. But it was headline news yesterday, according to NBC News, that the two major Democrats did attend different churches in order to make a political public attendance. The vice president and current Democratic nominee, Kamala Harris, appeared at New Birth Missionary Baptist Church outside Atlanta. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, the vice presidential nominee, visited a church known as Victorious Believers Ministries in Saginaw, Michigan. Now, Michigan and Georgia are key states in the 2024 election, and both of those churches reflected key constituencies, in particular, the African-American church when it comes to the Democratic ticket.\n\nBut NBC news reported, \u201cThe United States has grown even more secular in the eight years since President Obama left office with a record 28% of U.S. adults now identifying as religiously unaffiliated, according to Pew,\u201d as the Pew Research Center, \u201csurpassing evangelical protestants and Catholics to now be the largest religious group in the country.\u201d So, NBC is explaining that one of the reasons why religion hasn\u2019t factored much in terms of the 2024 election is because America\u2019s growing more secular. As the report says, \u201cWhile candidates and both parties have traditionally sought to play up their piety to appeal to religious voters and signal their personal integrity, Harris, Trump, and their running mates have not centered their faith this year.\u201d\n\nWell, that\u2019s certainly true. And even though evangelical protestants, for example, are overwhelmingly likely to vote for Donald Trump, there should be no delusion that, somehow, Donald Trump qualifies in any sense as an evangelical Christian. And frankly, it\u2019s not just his church identity. His early identity was associated with the Marble Collegiate Church and with the late Dr. Norman Vincent Peale, who was a prophet of prosperity theology. And then you go down to where the former president and the former first lady were married there in a church on Palm Beach. It is an episcopal church. And let\u2019s just say, rainbow flag out front, everything you could imagine inside.\n\nFurthermore, I think it\u2019s also pretty clear that, at least, in recent months, if you had a security camera outside America\u2019s churches, you\u2019re not likely to catch a surreptitious Vice President Harris or Former President Trump attending those services. When they attend now, it\u2019s pretty ostentatious. And on the Democratic side, these were clearly political appearances. Now, as I\u2019m saying, that\u2019s pretty much true for politicians across the board.\n\nThe big thing in this news report is that this is only happening now, that this hasn\u2019t been the routine in the campaign, thus far, and that both sides seem basically to, at least, until this point, have been basically ignoring, say, church attendance as a matter of political attention. I think that does tell us something. I think it tells us something about the secularization of this country and about a major shift in the electorate.\n\nAnd I\u2019ll just say that, on the Republican side, you\u2019ve got a really interesting picture. We really don\u2019t know much sincerely about Melania Trump\u2019s religion in terms of day-by-day religious practice or faith or the absence of the same. We really don\u2019t know much about Donald Trump\u2019s religion because, if you\u2019re going to read his heart, he has identified as a non-denominational protestant in recent years. And again, he does have that history in the Marble Collegiate Church prosperity gospel, prosperity theology Norman Vincent Peale. And he also has some other interesting connections as well. But no one has associated Donald Trump with any level of genuine religious piety. That hasn\u2019t even genuinely been claimed. The former president himself, in some speeches, identifies with Christians. He sometimes identifies with Christians. But let\u2019s just say that\u2019s an awkward embrace and everybody knows it.\n\nBut when it comes to Kamala Harris, well, as I mentioned before, she\u2019s a member of a very liberal Black Baptist church, which was very much involved in the civil rights movement, not so much to find theologically with a pastor who\u2019s very much a democratic activist and has been very involved in democratic politics. The NBC story made something very clear. Here\u2019s the report. \u201cHarris is a Baptist who was raised by a Black Anglican father and an Indian Hindu mother, and is now married to a reformed Jewish husband.\u201d\n\nNow, I don\u2019t even say that as a criticism. I just raised that because, number one, NBC reported it this way, and I do think it\u2019s important. I think it indicates much about religious change in the United States. I don\u2019t think further editorial comments are necessary. I think it is just a picture of an increasing number of Americans. We not only have blended families, with no fault divorce, and all kinds of marital arrangements, and all kinds of domestic arrangements. We not only have that happening. We also have the secularization of the United States. And we have religious mixing in a way that was inconceivable in previous generations, but increasingly now becomes, more and more, for many Americans, the norm, right down to the nominee for president of one of America\u2019s two major political parties.\n\nAnd you know this hasn\u2019t even been really a big issue. It just makes this news report by NBC News in the last days of the campaign, in which someone seems to have thought, \u201cThere must be a religious dimension to this, maybe we ought to look at it.\u201d Well, we, as Christians, know, there is, not only a religious dimension to this, there is a Christian worldview dimension to this. There is a theological analysis, worldview analysis aspect to this. It\u2019s our business to try to think these issues through. And yes, the secularization of the electorate, the secularization of the American people, that turns out to be a very real and very challenging reality. At the same time, it also tells us something that, with the race coming to a close and with most pollsters on both sides saying it\u2019s a very close race, some of the candidates went to church and made sure they were very visibly seen there.\n\nBut then, maybe, the vice president felt she had to go to church because, rather infamously now, last Thursday, a heckler cried out at one of her events, \u201cJesus is Lord,\u201d and the vice president interrupted her remarks and responded, \u201cOh, you guys are at the wrong rally. No, I think you meant to go to the smaller one down the street.\u201d Now, let\u2019s be clear. I didn\u2019t say that. She said that. So, I\u2019ll simply say, America may be growing more secular, undoubtedly so, but politicians continue to act like politicians on both sides of the aisle. And going to church is a political act, and it is interesting to see that, on the Democratic side, they decided yesterday to go to church. Just a coincidence.",

Trump cruised to victory in their respective parties\u2019 primaries. Mr. Trump dispatched with a large group of Republican challengers, most of whom ended their campaigns before a single vote was cast, and Mr. Biden faced only nominal opposition.\nBut a little over three weeks after a disastrous debate performance, Mr. Biden ended his campaign. Vice President Kamala Harris sought the nomination in the president\u2019s place, and the Democratic Party immediately consolidated around her. In early August, delegates officially chose her as the party\u2019s nominee.\nBoth major-party candidates have selected their running mates, essentially finalizing the field. Mr. Trump announced in July his choice of Senator JD Vance of Ohio, and Ms. Harris announced in August that she had chosen Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota.\nNumber of candidates in the race over time\nNearly all challengers to Mr. Trump dropped out before Super Tuesday.

BLINKEN\n\nOctober 22, 2024\n\nPresidential Elections in Moldova\n\nThe United States congratulates the Moldovan people for making their voices heard in record numbers in simultaneous presidential election and referendum on EU accession on October 20. The Government of Moldova and the Central Election Commission ensured the election was well-managed and competitive despite serious attempts by Russia to undermine the integrity of the process, as noted by the OSCE/ODIHR Observation Mission. Facing unprecedented Russian efforts to deny the Moldovan people their right to choose their own future, a majority of Moldovans voted to amend their constitution to advance Moldova\u2019s accession to the EU.\n\nRussia did everything in its power to disrupt the election and referendum to undermine Moldova\u2019s democracy, including through illicit financing and vote buying, disinformation, and malicious cyber activities. As we look ahead to Moldova\u2019s runoff presidential election on November 3, the United States remains concerned Russia will again attempt to prevent Moldovans from exercising their sovereign right to choose their own leaders.\n\nThe United States will continue to support Moldova\u2019s efforts to ensure a credible, transparent, and democratic process on November 3. Alongside our Allies and partners, the United States stands with the Moldovan people in their desire for a secure, prosperous, and democratic future.",

Vance.\n\nHere are some of the key dates and events related to the U.S. Presidential election:\n\nSeptember 10, 2024: U.S. presidential debate - Donald Trump and Kamala Harris faced each other on the debate stage for the first time on September 10, 2024.\n\nOctober 1, 2024: Vice presidential debate \u2013 Minnesota\u2019s Democrat Governor Tim Walz and Republican Senator from Ohio, J.D. Vance clashed on October 1, 2024.\n\nNovember 5, 2024: This is when voters across the United States will cast their ballots for president.\n\nNovember 25, 2024: This is the last day for 17 states and District of Columbia to allow postal votes to arrive with Election Day postmark.\n\nDecember 11, 2024: Electors in each state officially cast their votes for president and vice president.\n\nDecember 17, 2024: Deadline for 538 electoral college votes to arrive in Washington.\n\nJanuary 6, 2025: Electoral college votes formally counted before Congress.\n\nJanuary 20, 2025: The elected president and vice president are inaugurated and officially take office.\n\nWhat are electoral college votes?\n\nThe electoral college refers to a process, wherein, based mostly on a winner-takes-all rule, each U.S. State chooses its electors, who then go on to pick the President and the Vice-President. The college also encompasses counting of the electoral votes by the U.S. Congress.\n\nFor example, if more than 50% of the voters in the State of New York vote for the Democratic Party, then all the potential electors allocated to that State will be Democratic. Each State has the same number of electors as it does members in its Congressional delegation, namely one for each member in the House of Representatives, and two Senators. Nationwide, there are 538 electors, and to win the presidency, a candidate would be required to secure 270 votes in the electoral college.\n\nThe 2024 U.S. election is anticipated to be closely watched and significantly impactful, with many variables that can change the dynamics leading up to election day.",

        "text": "Social media disinformation looms over presidential election\nEXPERT ANALYSIS\n\nTaylor Swift has entered the chat. And so have singer Charli XCX, brat memes, cats and dogs, offbeat humor, absurd AI-generated photos, and firestorms of misinformation.\n\nIt\u2019s been a bizarre time for the presidential elections. University of Michigan School of Information researchers\u2014experts on social media, misinformation and disinformation\u2014have watched it all unfold.\n\nCliff Lampe\n\n\u201cSocial media has played a bigger role, I think, than we saw in the last election,\u201d said professor Cliff Lampe, a social media expert.\n\nMore celebrities have made their political voices heard. For instance, Taylor Swift signed off on her endorsement letter to the Harris-Walz campaign with \u201cChildless Cat Lady,\u201d in a dig against JD Vance. Donald Trump Jr. posted an AI-generated photo of Donald Trump on a giant cat with the caption \u201cSave our pets!!!!!\u201d\n\nThe Harris-Walz campaign has targeted Gen Z Americans on their home turf: TikTok. Could this be a good thing?\n\nChelsea Peterson-Salahuddin\n\n\u201cYounger people have been really demotivated to come out and vote,\u201d says assistant professor Chelsea Peterson-Salahuddin, whose research focuses on the culturally specific ways marginalized communities\u2014most often Black women, femmes and queer folks\u2014engage with mass and digital communications technologies to seek information and build community. \u201cThe Harris campaign has tapped into TikTok meme culture and attempted to capitalize on a younger vote.\u201d\n\nThe 2024 election\u2014and the prior two presidential elections\u2014have demonstrated how technology can both undermine and empower democracy. But associate professor David Jurgens, an expert in artificial intelligence and social media, notes that one bedrock of democratic discourse\u2014rhetoric\u2014seems stuck in perpetual decline.\n\nDavid Jurgens\n\n\u201cThe degree of eloquence in making campaign arguments has dropped,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the 2016 and 2020 elections were effective in raising the anger rhetoric, but in 2024, the silliness rhetoric has come onboard, as well.\u201d\n\nAlthough the memes are sometimes funny, their ability to parade as official sources of truth has become a pressing concern.\n\nUMSI experts have studied the impact of misinformation\u2014false or misleading information shared without harmful intent\u2014on democracy.\n\n\u201cSocial media allows for the rapid spread of disinformation,\u201d Lampe said. \u201cIf we can\u2019t even agree on fairly straightforward things, and truth becomes entirely subjective to your identity affiliation, it can be super harmful to democracy overall. The 2020 claims of the stolen election, for example, were proven wrong multiple times. But it doesn\u2019t matter, right? There\u2019s definitely been a blow to democracy.\u201d\n\nUMSI experts said it will take media literacy, education and government regulation to combat the pervasive spread of falsehoods and restore trust in public discourse. The widespread use of generative AI, especially, has changed the sophistication and quality of the information people are capable of producing. It also raised our level of skepticism in engaging with information we see online.\n\nAssistant professor Nazanin Andalibi said the United States needs greater regulation and social media companies\u2019 incentive structures need to change to better protect against harmful speech.\n\nNazanin Andalibi\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t trust tech companies to be of any help here,\u201d she said, regarding companies self-regulating. \u201cTheir obligation is to make money.\u201d\n\nAndalibi would like to see a system that attends to a set of values and a social media governance model that has different incentive structures and motivations than currently exist.\n\nThere is no quick fix for these issues, but election years have a way of highlighting what\u2019s at stake when technology is unrestrained and moving faster than society can control it.\n\nMatt Bui\n\n\u201cWe need to be thinking critically about what types of information infrastructures we need to build back the trust that has been lost,\u201d said assistant professor Matt Bui, who studies data justice and activism. \u201cWe need infrastructures that help communities form but also foster a sense of cohesion and unity.\u201d",

        "text": "ABF Research Professor Traci Burch Explores Barriers to Participation Ahead of the 2024 Presidential Election\nAs the 2024 US presidential election approaches, the work of American Bar Foundation Research Professor Traci Burch takes on heightened importance in understanding how voter eligibility verification systems impact political participation\u2014especially for marginalized communities. With over a decade of research experience at the intersection of criminal justice and political participation, Burch is uniquely positioned to provide insights into how barriers to participation, including voter registration and ID requirements, affect voter turnout and broader democratic engagement.\n\nIn a recent interview with ABF Executive Director Mark Suchman, Burch discusses her research on voter disenfranchisement and the challenges administrative processes pose for voters. She explains how some voters, particularly low-income individuals, older people, rural residents, and those with past felony convictions, may struggle to navigate the bureaucratic hurdles involved in voter registration and ID, even when they are eligible to vote.\n\nOne of the key points in the interview is Burch\u2019s discussion of \u201cadministrative exclusion,\u201d a concept she adopts from public policy research. Administrative exclusion refers to the ways in which eligible voters can be excluded from the voting process due to the complexity and cost of compliance with administrative rules, such as obtaining birth certificates or verifying eligibility post-incarceration. \u201cYou might have a person who is eligible to vote and wants to participate,\u201d says Burch, \u201cbut due to the design of the process itself, it becomes really difficult. It\u2019s not the person\u2019s eligibility that\u2019s the issue\u2014it\u2019s the administrative system excluding them.\u201d\n\nIn prior research, Burch looked specifically at voting patterns among individuals with felony convictions. Her analysis revealed that, even after serving their sentences, many individuals who had been disenfranchised faced significant administrative barriers when they sought to reengage with the political process. These barriers, she argues, are part of a broader issue of penal disenfranchisement, which extends beyond individuals to entire communities.\n\nBurch also shared insights into her ongoing research, which includes collecting data on voter registration processes and studying how policy changes over time affect voter participation. As the presidential election approaches, her research will focus on understanding how these administrative processes vary across states and how they influence overall voter turnout.\n\n###\n\nAbout the American Bar Foundation\n\nThe American Bar Foundation (ABF) is the world\u2019s leading research institute for the empirical and interdisciplinary study of law.

        "text": "Trump vs Harris: Who is leading in the US presidential election polls?\nDiscover who's gaining and who's losing ground in the latest US presidential election opinion polls.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOn 5 November, US citizens will head to the polls to choose their next president in an election that looks to be on a knife-edge.\n\nDonald Trump had expected to go into the election against sitting President Joe Biden, but after Biden dropped out of the race in the summer and gave his backing to Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump found himself facing a tougher path to another term.\n\nHowever, Harris has not yet taken a decisive polling lead against Trump, either nationally or in the seven swing states expected to decide the outcome, making predicting how the election will fall extremely difficult.\n\nSo as things stand, who is in the lead, and who is predicted to win?\n\nAccording to the latest data, while there are glimmers of hope for Harris, it\u2019s all coming up Trump.\n\nNationally, the vote is as tight as it can possibly be. Since August, Harris has held a consistent edge in national polling according to most of the major polling aggregators.\n\nAccording to Euronews Polling models, Harris now holds just a .9% lead nationally. Our numbers are flanked by America\u2019s two most prominent polling aggregators, FiveThirtyEight and RealClearPolitics.\n\nAt this point, Harris and her campaign must be hoping that the pollsters have adjusted for their mistakes in the previous two elections.\n\nMost concerning for the Democrats, it was the the RealClearPolitcs model that showed the closest race of all the models heading into election day 2020.\n\nIn 2016, when Trump stunned the political polling industry to beat Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Party candidate held a 4.5% lead on October 28.\n\nEven if the pollsters have finally figured out the proper voter projection adjustments and methodologies needed for better accuracy, Harris could still very well be losing this election.\n\nAmong the seven most critical swing states \u2014 Pennsylvania, Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Nevada and Wisconsin \u2014 Trump is either ahead or tied with Harris in all of them.\n\nFiveThirtyEight\u2019s data shows a dead-heat race in four of the seven battleground states, with Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan and Nevada all listed as \u201ctied\u201d by the popular aggregator, which is owned by ABC News. They show Trump ahead by 1+ percent in North Carolina and Georgia, and ahead by 2+% in Arizona.\n\nAccording to Euronews Polls Centre sources with the campaigns, Arizona appears to be trending solidly for Trump \u2014 which would amount to a severe loss for the Democrats after winning the key southwestern state in 2020. The internal campaign data is backed up by recent New York Times/Siena College polling.\n\nLast week, the group released a damning poll for the Democrats that showed Trump up five points in Arizona, buoyed by lower-than-normal Democratic support by young and minority voters in the swing state. (Read more about youth vote trends in Europe and America here).\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhile FiveThirtyEight still shows an abundance of ties, RCP\u2019s swing state averages all currently favour Trump. However, the leads are marginal at best. Trump currently holds leads of .5% or less in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan.\n\nIn 2020, Joe Biden won 306 of the 538 Electoral College votes, winning all of the aforementioned swing states with the exception of North Carolina.\n\nIn 2016, Trump won 304 of the 538 Electoral College votes, winning all of the aforementioned swing states with the exception of Nevada.\n\nIf the current polling comes to pass, Trump will win 312 Electoral College votes and would be the best Electoral College result for a winner since then-President Barack Obama beat Mitt Romney with 332 Electoral College votes in his re-election campaign.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe betting markets also continue to favour Trump. When we last updated this column, Trump had just jumped back into the lead in the betting markets for the first time since July, with a betting market average showing Trump with a 57.6% chance of winning the election.\n\nAs of 28 October, Trump now holds a 61.8% chance of winning the election, according to an average of the gambling projections. Popular betting site, BetOnline, currently gives the former president a 63% chance of winning.\n\nDespite the large volume of bad news coming at the wrong time for the Vice President, the Harris campaign did get some good news over the weekend.\n\nAn ABC/Ipsos poll released on Sunday showed Harris with a 4-point advantage over Trump nationally, her best result in an ABC/Ipsos poll since September 13, just days after she outduelled Trump in their only presidential debate.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe ABC/Ipsos poll, a 51-to-47% lead for Harris, included data that is key to overcoming Trump\u2019s momentum and her campaign stagnancy.\n\nAccording to respondents, those listing the economy or inflation as the single most important issue dropped by 7%. That\u2019s good news for Harris, as Trump has regularly commanded a lead on economic issues. In the ABC poll, Trump led Harris on \u201chandling the economy\u201d by 8% and on \u201chandling inflation\u201d by 7 points.\n\nAs in Europe, the economy has been a key motivator for voters. It is a major reason why Harris\u2019 boss, President Biden, suffers from a dismal 36% approval rating. If voters feel the economy and inflation are less of a concern, it could help shift the focus to other issues where she holds advantages, such as \u201cprotecting democracy\u201d or \u201clooking out for the middle class\u201d.\n\nStill, the Trump campaign will continue to drive home economic issues in both their speeches and advertising. Just how important the issue is to a plurality of voters could be the reason Harris wins or loses the election next week.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn the famous words of former Bill Clinton campaign strategist James Carville: It\u2019s the economy, stupid.",

        "text": "The Guardian view on the US presidential election 2024: a Democratic government is the one we need\nThe mood may be one of despair. But this election is critical to the country\u2019s future? The best hope lies with Kamala. Only her government can shape the future we want to see\n\nIt is hard to imagine a worse candidate for the American presidency in 2024 than Donald J Trump. His history of dishonesty, hypocrisy and greed makes him wholly unfit for the office. A second Trump term would erode the rule of law, diminish America\u2019s global standing and deepen racial and cultural divides. Even if he loses, Mr Trump has shown that he will undermine the election process, with allies spreading unfounded conspiracy theories to delegitimise the results.\n\nThere are prominent Republicans \u2013 such as the former vice-president Dick Cheney \u2013 who refused to support Mr Trump owing to the threat he poses. Gen Mark Milley, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff under Mr Trump, calls his former boss a \u201cfascist\u201d. America was founded in opposition to absolute monarchy. The Republican nominee models himself after the leader he most admires: Russia\u2019s autocratic president, Vladimir Putin.\n\nMr Trump\u2019s authoritarianism may finish US democracy. He has praised and promised to pardon those convicted in the January 6 insurrection. He has suggested bypassing legal norms to use potentially violent methods of repression, blurring the lines between vigilantism, law enforcement and military action, against groups \u2013 be they Democrats or undocumented immigrants \u2013 he views as enemies.\n\nHis team has tried to distance itself from the Heritage Foundation\u2019s Project 2025 and its extreme proposals \u2013 such as mass firings of civil servants and erasing women\u2019s rights \u2013 that poll poorly. But it is likely that, in office, Mr Trump would adopt many of these intolerant, patriarchal and discriminatory plans. He aims to dismantle the government to enrich himself and evade the law. If Republicans gain control of the Senate, House and White House, he would interpret it as a mandate to silence his critics and entrench his power.\n\nMr Trump is a transactional and corrupting politician. His supporters see this as an advantage. Christian nationalists want an authoritarian regime to enforce religious edicts on Americans. Elon Musk wants to shape the future without regulatory oversight. Both put self-interest ahead of the American people. Democracy erodes slowly at first, then all at once. In office, Mr Trump appointed three supreme court justices, who this summer blocked efforts to hold him accountable for trying to overturn the 2020 election: their immunity ruling renders the president \u201ca king above the law\u201d, in the words of the liberal justice Sonia Sotomayor.\n\nA historic president\n\nSince Kamala Harris stepped into the spotlight following Joe Biden\u2019s exit, her campaign has been a masterclass in political jujitsu, deftly flipping Mr Trump\u2019s perceived strengths into glaring weaknesses. With a focus on joy, the vice-president sharply contrasted with Mr Trump\u2019s grim narrative of US decline. In their sole televised debate, Ms Harris skillfully outmaneuvered Mr Trump, who fell into her traps, appearing angry and incoherent. She is confident and composed. He sounds unhinged.\n\nThe Trump agenda threatens to dismantle voting rights, women\u2019s rights and minority rights \u2013 not just reversing decades of social progress but burying it. Mr Trump was behind the shredding of reproductive rights. The conservative forces rallying to him are now intent on imposing a national abortion ban, with \u2013 should he win \u2013 dire implications for IVF and birth control. Republicans have been hurt in the polls by being associated with such unpopular policies \u2013 a weak spot that Ms Harris should keep exploiting.\n\nThe vice-president has energised Democrats with savvy media appearances while appealing to swing voters. Progressives, determined to defeat Mr Trump, remain committed to freedom and equality. But Ms Harris has disappointed those who have urged her to take a stand on US complicity in Israel\u2019s bombing of civilians in Gaza and Lebanon. Downplaying war crimes, as arms flow to Israel, has already harmed Democratic chances in key swing states like Michigan.\n\nIn a political system where style often rivals substance, perception is crucial. While Ms Harris hasn\u2019t made her race and gender central to her campaign, her victory would be historic: she would be the first woman, and the first woman of color, to be president. Symbolism matters to her base. Her candidacy rallied key constituencies \u2013 the young, women, African Americans and Hispanics \u2013 who were cooling on Mr Biden. This election is a leap of faith in Ms Harris, who offers a sense of possibility for the future, while Mr Trump clings to a reactionary past.\n\nProtecting democracy\n\nDespite his criminal conviction and being declared a rapist by a judge, Mr Trump remains dangerously close to reclaiming the presidency. Many voters still back a man who was the worst US president ever. But probably not a majority of US voters. Republicans benefit from a skewed electoral system: Democrats have won the popular vote in all but one election since 1992, and secured the overall popular majority for the Senate in every six-year cycle since 1996. Yet the country has often been led by Republican presidents and a GOP-controlled Senate, and therefore a Republican-dominated supreme court. In a close race in November, that could mean Mr Trump doesn\u2019t need to win the election \u2013 just a court case.\n\nMr Biden has been a transformational political figure, but he didn\u2019t transform the country. He aimed to tackle inequality, broken public services and the climate crisis with a $4tn plan funded by taxing the rich. His goal was to restore his party\u2019s political credibility by marrying social liberalism with economic justice. But corporate influence and the Democrats\u2019 slim Senate majority shrank his ambitions. Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine shifted his focus to national security, as America experienced rising prices. However, Mr Biden made historic investments to green the economy and refocused industrial policy to take on China. Ms Harris\u2019s plans aim to recapture the spirit of Mr Biden\u2019s insurgency.\n\nThe US economy is stronger than it has been in decades, yet Mr Trump consistently outpolls Ms Harris on economic issues. This perhaps reflects decades of neoliberalism. Real wages for blue-collar workers have stagnated since the 1970s, while inflation-adjusted house prices have doubled. Polls show 70% of Americans feel significant political and economic reform is needed, putting Democrats at a disadvantage as they are linked to the status quo.\n\nPolitical hope fades when we settle for what is, instead of fighting for what could be. Ms Harris embodies the conviction that it\u2019s better to believe in democracy\u2019s potential than to surrender to its imperfections. The Republican agenda is clear: voter suppression, book bans and tax cuts for billionaires. Democrats seek global engagement; the GOP favours isolation. The Biden-Harris administration laid the groundwork for a net zero America. A Trumpian comeback would undo it. A Harris win, with a Democratic Congress, means a chance to restore good governance, create good jobs and lead the entire planet\u2019s climate efforts. Defeating Mr Trump protects democracy from oligarchy and dictatorship. There is too much at stake not to back Ms Harris for president.",

On Wednesday, it\u2019s Georgia on their minds.\n\nVoters in Hawaii, Missouri, Utah, and Wisconsin started casting their ballots on Tuesday, joining several other states that began early voting in recent weeks.\n\nPolls suggest Democratic candidate Kamala Harris and Republican contender Donald Trump are neck-and-neck nationwide and in battleground states.\n\nOn Tuesday, Harris gave two interviews \u2013 one to NBC News and another with Telemundo. Meanwhile, Trump held a rally in North Carolina after hosting a roundtable discussion with Latino leaders.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at what the polls say, the key highlights from campaigns over the previous day, and what to expect next.\n\nAccording to polls, there is a close race between both candidates. On Tuesday, a Reuters/Ipsos poll suggested that Harris had a slight lead over Trump, with 46 percent to 43 percent.\n\nHarris\u2019s lead in the six-day poll that closed on Monday was similar to her 45 percent to 42 percent advantage over Trump in a Reuters/Ipsos poll from the previous week.\n\nThe new poll also suggested that voters share a negative outlook on the economy and immigration, generally favouring Trump\u2019s approach to these issues. About 60 percent believed the economy was moving in the wrong direction.\n\nAccording to FiveThirtyEight\u2019s daily election poll tracker, as of October 22, Harris was leading in the national polls and had a 1.9 percentage-point lead over Trump.\n\nNational surveys provide valuable insights into voter sentiment, but the outcome of the Electoral College \u2013 determined by state-by-state results \u2013 ultimately decides the winner, with seven battleground states expected to be critical.\n\nThe difference between Harris and Trump in each of the seven battleground states \u2014 Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Georgia, Michigan, Arizona, Wisconsin and Nevada \u2014 is within the margin of error of polls. That means the two candidates are effectively tied across these states, with Trump marginally ahead in the poll averages for Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina and Arizona, and Harris with a wafer-thin lead in Michigan, Wisconsin and Nevada.\n\nIf these marginal differences between their polling numbers hold, Trump is likely to win the presidency. But if polls undercounted support for Harris in even one of the battleground states Trump leads in, the outcome could be a win for the incumbent vice president.\n\nWhat was Kamala Harris up to on Tuesday?\n\nIn an interview with NBC in Washington, DC, Harris said her team is prepared to challenge any early victory claim made by Trump, emphasising that her priority is defeating him.\n\nShe said the Democrats \u201chave the resources and expertise\u201d to counter any attempts by Trump to undermine the election.\n\n\u201cThis is a person, Donald Trump, who tried to undo a free and fair election, who still denies the will of the people, who incited a violent mob to attack the United States Capitol and some 140 law enforcement officers were attacked, some were killed. This is a very serious matter,\u201d she added.\n\nShe was also interviewed by Telemundo, a Spanish-language television network in the US. During the interview, she said, according to a report by The Associated Press news agency, that she will work to build an economy that \u201csupports the working class\u201d. She also emphasised her focus on solutions that \u201ccould bring more capital\u201d to the community. This interview is set to air on Wednesday at 23:00 GMT.\n\nTim Walz, Harris\u2019s running mate, took aim at Trump while addressing a crowd in Madison, Wisconsin, before former President Barack Obama\u2019s appearance. Walz said Trump had no stamina and was meandering in his speeches.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, Trump criticised Harris for not making any campaign appearances that day.\n\nDuring his speech in Madison, Wisconsin, Obama said he had already voted in Chicago. Obama told the crowd: \u201cIf you haven\u2019t voted yet, I won\u2019t be offended if you just walk out right now [to go vote].\u201d\n\nHe also took potshots at Trump. \u201cYou\u2019d be worried if grandpa was acting like\u201d Trump, Obama said.\n\n\u201cThis is coming from somebody who wants unchecked power,\u201d Obama said. \u201cSo, Wisconsin, we do not need to see what an older, loonier Donald Trump looks like with no guardrails. America is ready to turn the page.\u201d\n\nWhat was Donald Trump up to?\n\nTrump held a roundtable with Latino leaders in Florida. In his opening remarks, prominent Florida Republicans, including Miami Mayor Francis Suarez and US Senator Rick Scott, highlighted Trump\u2019s record of supporting the Hispanic community during his previous term.\n\nAccording to Al Jazeera\u2019s John Holman, reporting from Miami, Harris has strong support among Latino voters, while Trump is working to secure key endorsements from the community, especially in politically vital states.\n\n\u201cWhen we look at the battleground states, according to Voto Latino, Harris has the support of 63 percent of Latino voters, while Trump has less than half of that at 31 percent,\u201d Holman said.\n\n\u201cWhat he will be trying to do is not to supersede the support that Harris has, but to prise enough Latino voters away from her, especially in states like Nevada and Arizona \u2026 to try to get a path to victory, and there are signs especially among male Latino voters that he might be able to do that,\u201d he added.\n\nIn his appearance, he criticised Harris saying, \u201cShe\u2019s sleeping right now \u2026 This is not what you want.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s remarks follow Harris\u2019s attempt to portray him as \u201cexhausted\u201d after he withdrew from several interviews.\n\nThe former president also took the opportunity to criticise the Biden administration for the leak of classified documents purportedly outlining Israel\u2019s plans for an attack on Iran. He called it a \u201cbad thing\u201d.\n\n\u201cCan you imagine somebody doing that? That\u2019s the enemy. I guess that maybe [it] is the enemy from within,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump also painted a grim picture of what he sees as the stakes in the upcoming election in two weeks.\n\n\u201cIf we lose this election, we may not have a country any more,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTowards the end of the day, Trump also held a rally in North Carolina, where he criticised the state\u2019s economy and attacked Harris.\n\nTHANK YOU, NORTH CAROLINA! This election is a choice between whether we will have four more years of incompetence, failure, and disaster\u2014or whether we will begin the FOUR GREATEST YEARS in the HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY! pic.twitter.com/JJhJsJcOHk \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 23, 2024\n\nWhat\u2019s next for the Harris and Trump campaigns?\n\nHarris to participate in a CNN town hall\n\nOn Wednesday, CNN will host a live town hall with Harris outside of Philadelphia with a live audience of undecided voters. Walz is set to return to the city on Friday, marking his first visit back to Philadelphia since being announced as Harris\u2019s running mate over the summer.\n\nSeparately on Thursday, iconic musician Bruce Springsteen will appear with Harris and Obama at a rally in Atlanta, Georgia, according to sources.\n\nTrump to campaign in battleground Georgia\n\nTrump is expected to campaign in Georgia too. In the state \u2013 with 16 Electoral College votes \u2013 Trump is leading Harris by 1.5 percentage points, according to FiveThirtyEight\u2019s daily election poll tracker.\n\nBoth campaigns are focused on securing Georgia. The state narrowly went to Joe Biden in 2020, contributing to his victory in the last presidential election. Trump won Georgia in 2016 on his way to the presidency.\n\nPopular podcaster Joe Rogan will interview Trump on Friday.\n\nTrump and Rogan share a complicated history. Although they shook hands and chatted briefly at a UFC fight, Trump later criticised Rogan after he remarked that then-candidate Robert Kennedy Jr was the only one running who made sense to him. Rogan is a UFC commentator.\n\n\u201cIt will be interesting to see how loudly Joe Rogan gets BOOED the next time he enters the UFC Ring???

        "text": "Four election vulnerabilities uncovered by a Michigan Engineer\nExperts J. Alex Halderman See full bio Professor of Computer Science and Engineering Bredt Family Professor of Engineering\n\nThe work of J. Alex Halderman, a professor of computer science and engineering, has made the United States election system more secure\u2014largely by uncovering vulnerabilities in equipment like voting machines and ballot scanners, and by advocating for best practices and technological advances.\n\nAlong the way, he has also run up against the limitations of our elections systems, and even resistance from technology vendors and election officials. Ironically, his work has also been used to prop up false theories about fraud in the 2020 presidential election. (For his thoughts on this, read the Q&A with Michigan News.)\n\nHere are some of the key ways Halderman\u2019s work has helped to strengthen election integrity in the U.S.\n\nGenerating a paper voting record\n\nGeorgia\n\nChallenge\n\nIn 2017, Georgia was one of only a few states that still used paperless electronic voting machines statewide. These don\u2019t give voters a way to ensure that their selections were recorded accurately or provide a physical record, which could be needed to rule out suspected electronic fraud.\n\nSolution\n\nHalderman\u2019s research helped spur a lawsuit filed by the Coalition for Good Governance, a nonpartisan, nonprofit advocacy organization, and a handful of individual Georgia voters. Halderman testified as an expert and demonstrated on the witness stand how the machines could be hacked to steal votes. As a result, Georgia replaced its machines with new ones that produce a paper record. Manufactured by Dominion Voting Systems, the machines were installed in time for the 2020 presidential election.\n\nFederal court ruling prohibiting Georgia from continuing to use paperless voting (PDF)\n\nPatching software vulnerabilities\n\nGeorgia\n\nChallenge\n\nRather than using hand-marked ballots like most states, Georgia\u2019s new system uses a machine to print voters\u2019 completed ballots, which encode the selections in a barcode that voters have no way to verify. When Halderman examined these machines after a federal court granted him access in 2020, he found that it was possible for a hacker to change the votes encoded in the barcode, even without physical access to the machines. The risk increased after January 7, 2021, when confidential election machine software and data from Coffey County, Georgia was illicitly copied and disseminated.\n\nSolution\n\nAfter Halderman\u2019s court testimony and 96-page report, Dominion Voting Systems developed a patch for several of the software vulnerabilities he discovered.\n\nHowever, Georgia election officials have not implemented the fix. Secretary of State Brad Raffensberger, who has announced that the machines will not be updated until after the 2024 presidential election, described the risks Halderman identified as \u201ctheoretical and imaginary.\u201d While a report commissioned by Dominion from the national security nonprofit MITRE argued at the time that the attacks were infeasible as long as physical security was sufficient to prevent access to the machines, the Coffee County incident later showed that such access is, in fact, possible.\n\nIn-depth explanation on Freedom to Tinker\n\nMaking voting machines more reliable\n\nMichigan\n\nChallenge\n\nIn November 2020, election officials in northern Michigan\u2019s Antrim County published incorrect vote totals in their initial counts, which were later corrected. Halderman investigated at the request of the Michigan secretary of state and attorney general and found no evidence of fraud. Instead, he discovered that a chain of human errors and insufficient software guardrails led to an incorrect ballot scanner configuration, producing the erroneous results.\n\nSolution\n\nSince the investigation, Halderman\u2019s team has devised a way to bring tests of election election equipment, a process known as logic and accuracy testing, into the 21st century. The ways electronic voting machines can introduce errors are more complex than the obsolete mechanical voting machines for which existing testing methods were designed. Now, software developed by Halderman\u2019s team thoroughly checks the system\u2019s configuration in the smallest possible number of ballots, making the process comprehensive but still manageable for election officials. It has recently been piloted in several Michigan counties and Halderman is hopeful that it will be ready for use statewide before the upcoming election.\n\nPaper on investigation for USENIX Security Symposium, 2022 (PDF)\n\nLogic and accuracy testing for 21st century Michigan (PDF) (to appear in Operations Research, 2024)\n\nHalderman\u2019s group held a demonstration election at the University of Michigan in March, 2018, to show how susceptible voting machines are to hacking, and how paper ballots are much more reliable. Photo: Levi Hutmacher/Michigan Engineering\n\nSecuring voters\u2019 privacy\n\n21 states\n\nChallenge\n\nMany municipalities publish ballot-level voting results online\u2014either as ballot scans or lists of votes cast\u2014to promote transparency. The data is randomly shuffled to protect voters\u2019 identities. However, Halderman\u2019s team found a vulnerability in certain Dominion Voting Systems ballot scanners that could un-shuffle the ballot information and reveal who cast what votes, which they detailed in a study published in August 2024.\n\nSolution\n\nHalderman\u2019s team reported the flaw to federal authorities and Dominion, which developed a software patch in response. His team also developed an open-source software tool and detailed instructions to help municipalities sanitize the data so that it is safe to make public.\n\nPaper about the flaw for USENIX Security Symposium, 2024 (PDF)\n\nRelated Stories",

The fight for Latino voters is very much in the spotlight Tuesday . Former President Barack Obama will visit two Democratic strongholds on Tuesday \u2014 Madison, Wisconsin and Detroit .",
        "text": "October 22, 2024, presidential campaign news\nElena Jimenez carries a voting guide during a voter engagement event for the Latino community in Greensboro, North Carolina, on September 21. Chuck Burton/AP\n\nWith two weeks until Election Day and nearly 16 million ballots already cast across the country, former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are competing for a shrinking universe of available voters \u2014 with the audiences the two nominees are striving to reach serving as a guide of where their campaigns see the 2024 race ultimately being decided.\n\nTargeted message: The fight for Latino voters is very much in the spotlight Tuesday. Trump is holding a roundtable with Latino leaders at his Doral golf resort in the Miami area while Harris sits down for an interview with Telemundo where she is expected to announce new efforts to expand economic opportunity aimed at Latino men. The dueling appeals come as polls have shown Harris\u2019 support among Latino voters lagging behind the performance of past Democratic nominees, with even a small shift in the margins having the potential to alter the outcome in battleground states such as Arizona, Nevada and Pennsylvania.\n\nOn Monday, Harris spent the day alongside former Wyoming GOP Rep. Liz Cheney in an effort to try and win over independent and moderate Republican voters in the suburbs of Philadelphia, Detroit and Milwaukee. Cheney leaned on her conservative credentials to vouch for the vice president and encourage likeminded Americans to \u201cvote your conscience\u201d without ever needing \u201cto say a word to anybody.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s Edward-Isaac Dovere explores the strategy for the Harris campaign in the final two weeks and how it plans to reach the increasingly narrow slice of the electorate that remains up for grabs:\n\n\u201cSome of the outreach will include reviving Biden-style themes around Trump\u2019s unfitness for office, trying to make the argument for a stable commander in chief while convincing wavering voters to make the leap toward electing the first Black female president.\u201d Read his full story here.\n\nIn addition to the vice president\u2019s outreach, the campaign is also deploying surrogates in ways to maximize their impact ahead of Election Day. Former President Barack Obama will visit two Democratic strongholds on Tuesday \u2014 Madison, Wisconsin and Detroit. In Wisconsin, the former president will be joined by vice presidential nominee Tim Walz, while in Michigan, Obama will be introduced by rapper Eminem, who is expected to offer rare thoughts on campaign politics, CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny reports.\n\nTrump\u2019s Tar Heel pitch: Following his Florida event, the former president is set to return to North Carolina for a second consecutive day after holding a trio of events in the Tar Heel State on Monday that underscored the importance of the state\u2019s 16 electoral votes to Trump\u2019s pathway to victory in November.\n\nTaken together, the three events showed how the GOP nominee has made stoking fears about a Harris presidency central to his closing argument. He sought to appeal to evangelical voters by accusing Harris of being \u201cvery destructive to religion\u201d while also railing against the vice president\u2019s handling of immigration, continuing to push false claims that FEMA has run out of money for disaster relief for those affected by recent storms because the Biden administration spent the funds on undocumented immigrants.\n\nThe Harris campaign has made concerns about Trump a centerpiece of its messaging as well \u2014 with the vice president repeatedly warning that her Republican rival is \u201cunstable\u201d and \u201cunhinged\u201d \u2014 leaning on that contrast to motivate voters who might still hold reservations about her candidacy.",

The economy was the second most common, with 73% of adults having reported it as a significant source of stress. The 2024 U.S. presidential election followed closely at 69%.\n\nSyracuse University Psychology Professor Kevin Antshel offers four recommendations for managing stress and anxiety during the 2024 election season:\n\n\u201cMany people are feeling heightened anxiety and stress during the 2024 election season. Concerns from 2020 have persisted, and in my opinion, have been amplified by ongoing national and global events. In my own clinical practice, I often hear anxieties pertaining to global instability, erosions of civil rights and the impact of misinformation. All three of these anxieties are being intensified by the polarizing election season and, most concerningly to me, seem to be associated with increased feelings of helplessness,\u201d said Professor Antshel\n\n\u201cTo manage the increased stress, anxiety and helplessness that some may be experiencing in the 2024 election season, several of the following coping strategies may be beneficial to consider,\u201d said Professor Antshel.\n\n\u201cFocus on what you can control \u2013 the antidote to helplessness is taking action. Channel your energy into constructive activities that can provide a sense of accomplishment. Practice self-care \u2013 adequate sleep, regular physical activity and healthy eating habits are important for all of us, yet especially important during stressful times. Obtain adequate social support offline \u2013 online discussions can become flame wars and unproductive. Meaningfully connect with others offline daily. Set boundaries around news consumption and social media use. Stay grounded and keep your perspective \u2013 try to not allow dark feelings and events to take up all your mental space. Make room to see the good and experiences that give you hope and purpose.\u201d\n\nTo schedule an interview, please contact Ellen James Mbuqe, executive director of media relations, at ejmbuqe@syr.edu.",

        "summary": " The notion that foreign policy matters little in US presidential elections has only gained ground over the last three decades . A September poll of voters by the Pew Research Center found that 62 percent of voters listed foreign policy as an issue that\u2019s very important to them .",
        "text": "Can foreign policy tip the US presidential election?\nIt is usually said in United States elections that \u201cbread and butter\u201d issues are what drive people to vote and shape their choices, with concerns about economic factors like inflation and the cost of living regularly topping the lists of voters\u2019 priorities.\n\nFurther-from-home issues like foreign policy, the wisdom goes, do not decide elections. As one adviser put it in the lead-up to Bill Clinton\u2019s election in 1992, \u201cIt\u2019s the economy, stupid\u201d. At the time, then-President George HW Bush had just ousted Iraqi forces from Kuwait, a foreign policy \u201cwin\u201d that did not secure Bush victory at the polls. The notion has since become a staple of election cycles \u2014 but historians and analysts warn it is only partially true.\n\nForeign policy does matter in US presidential elections, they warn, especially those tight enough to be decided by extremely narrow margins, as the current one promises to do.\n\nWith a protracted war in Ukraine and a widening one in the Middle East, both of which the US has spent heavily on and is growing more embroiled in, as well as foreign policy-related concerns like immigration and climate change that are at the top of many voters\u2019 priorities, it\u2019s clear that the economy won\u2019t be the lone factor determining how Americans vote next month.\n\nWhile the economy still tops the list, a September poll of voters by the Pew Research Center found that 62 percent of voters listed foreign policy as an issue that\u2019s very important to them. Foreign policy concerns were key for Trump voters in particular \u2014 70 percent of them \u2014 but 54 percent of Harris voters also listed foreign policy as a key priority for them, just as many as those who listed Supreme Court appointments as one.\n\n\u201cIn very close races such as this year\u2019s match-up between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, foreign policy issues could tip the balance,\u201d Gregory Aftandilian, a Middle East politics and US foreign policy scholar, wrote in a recent paper. \u201cIn particular, voters\u2019 views of how the candidates would handle the Israel-Hamas-Hezbollah and the Russia-Ukraine wars could be decisive in battleground states and thus the election.\u201d\n\nA US election myth\n\nThe notion that foreign policy matters little in US presidential elections has only gained ground over the last three decades. Until then, surveys polling Americans before elections found 30 to 60 percent of them listing a foreign policy issue as the most important one facing the country. As the Cold War ended, that number dropped to five percent.\n\n\u201cThis is largely a post-Cold War idea\u201d, Jeffrey A Friedman, an associate professor of government at Dartmouth College focused on the politics of foreign policy decision-making, told Al Jazeera.\n\nEven as post-9/11 the US launched years-long wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, which cost Americans some $8 trillion, in addition to thousands of lives, foreign policy played a secondary role in elections, though it did help former President George W Bush win re-election in 2004. While the 2003 invasion of Iraq made him widely unpopular later, at the time Bush won in part because he was able to capitalise on his role as the leader in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks.\n\nA candidate\u2019s ability to portray themselves as strong and decisive before the rest of the world, more than any specifics about the foreign policy decisions they would make, has mattered in the past, Friedman noted.\n\nHe cited former US President Lyndon Johnson, who paved the way for US escalation in Vietnam, during the 1964 presidential campaign. Johnson knew Americans did not want war in Vietnam, but he also knew he had to demonstrate that he would be \u201ctough on communism\u201d, said Friedman.\n\n\u201cVoters are always sceptical of the use of force abroad, but they are also sceptical of leaders who appear as though they will back down in the face of foreign aggression,\u201d he added. \u201cPresidential candidates are trying to convince voters that they\u2019re tough enough to be commander-in-chief. They don\u2019t want to promise that they\u2019ll involve the United States in armed conflicts, but they also need to avoid the perception that they will back down when challenged.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s precisely what both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are trying to do as Israel has expanded its year-long war in Gaza to Lebanon, and as it promises to drive the whole region, and possibly the US, into further conflict.\n\nMuch like opposition to the Vietnam War, which saw the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Illinois become the stage for mass protests that police violently repressed, US support for Israel has proven deeply divisive in the US, leading to nationwide campus sit-ins and presenting a foreign policy issue that candidates are regularly asked to address.\n\n\u201cHarris and Trump are in a very common bind with that,\u201d Friedman added. \u201cAnd so what they attempt to do is project a vague sense that they will competently handle the conflict without making any promises that would be divisive.\u201d\n\nThe Gaza vote\n\nMaking vague promises may be a strategy, but in light of the US\u2019s deep embroilment with Israel\u2019s wars in the Middle East, which the US has heavily subsidised and now risks becoming further entangled in, it might not be enough.\n\nWith polls an imprecise science, and razor-thin margins in many of the surveys, it\u2019s difficult to predict how much some Americans\u2019 dismay with US support for Israel may impact the vote, and whether pro-Palestine voters will turn to Trump, vote for third parties, stay home, or reluctantly vote for the continuation of President Joe Biden\u2019s policies that Harris has promised.\n\nBut the possibility that a protest vote over Gaza might tip the election is not so implausible, some polls suggest.\n\n\u201cIf Harris loses and she loses because Muslims didn\u2019t vote for her in swing states, it will be directly because of Gaza,\u201d Dalia Mogahed, a scholar at the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding (ISPU), told Al Jazeera. \u201cThe most important issue that Muslims cite for how they will judge a candidate is their handling of the war on Gaza.\u201d\n\nMogahed cited an ISPU study that found 65 percent of Muslim votes went to Biden in the 2020 election \u2014 a number significantly larger than the margin by which he won key battleground states. Before Biden dropped out of the race in July, the number of Muslim voters who said they would support him again had dropped to 12 percent.\n\nHarris has reiterated her unwavering support for Israel, and while she has at times softened her language and spoken of the suffering of Palestinians in more empathetic terms, she has indicated no readiness to shift on policy, and it is unclear she has earned back any of the support Biden lost.\n\nWhile the ISPU study focused on Muslim American voters, polls of Arab American voters yield similar results, and again see a foreign policy issue \u2014 the war in Gaza \u2014 as a key factor in the election.\n\nThere is a historical precedent for that, Friedman said, citing voting blocks like Cuban Americans in Florida opposed to the normalisation of relations with Cuba or Eastern European communities in the US backing Clinton\u2019s push to expand NATO in the mid-1990s. But if certain groups in the past have backed one candidate over another because of foreign policy preferences, a phenomenon like the Uncommitted National Movement is new, and a signal of deep disillusion with US foreign policy beyond party lines.\n\n\u201cThe notion that certain demographic groups have strongly held foreign policy preferences is not particularly new,\u201d Friedman said. \u201cWhat I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ve seen before is a fairly explicit threat by a community to withhold votes for a candidate whom you\u2019d ordinarily expect them to support.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s not just Muslim or Arab Americans or others, including many young voters, who may see the war in Gaza as the most pressing issue this election cycle, for whom foreign policy matters.\n\nAcross communities, particularly those most lacking in resources, foreign policy is often seen not as a far-removed problem but a \u201cdomestic issue\u201d, Rasha Mubarak, a community organiser in Orlando, Florida, told Al Jazeera.\n\n\u201cAmerican voters are able to assess the material conditions of their everyday life and connect it to what\u2019s happening in Gaza,\u201d said Mubarak, citing social needs from healthcare to hurricane relief that people understand would benefit from the public resources the US is investing to support military efforts abroad.\n\n\u201c[It\u2019s] beyond the moral issue of the fact that close to 200,000 Palestinians have been killed due to Israel\u2019s bombardment and genocide,\u201d said Mubarak, referring to what a study estimates is the potential cumulative toll of the war. \u201cAmerican voters understand the interconnectedness.\u201d",

        "text": "Media Coverage of the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election: The View from Germany and the United States - The Center for Information, Technology, and Public Life (CITAP)\nThe event provided a unique opportunity to explore media dynamics in the 2024 U.S. presidential election from both German and American perspectives. Attendees gained insights into the role of media in shaping public opinion and its implications for democracy in a global context. Juliane emphasized, \u201cIt\u2019s so much about the persona\u2014it\u2019s about how somebody is on stage rather than the actual issues.\u201d Juliane also noted that because so much is about the persona of Trump and issues that are over-covered, there are pivotal issues that are missed: \u201cWe are missing crucial topics in this election debate\u2014foreign policy, climate change, all left out of the conversation\u2026 it doesn\u2019t fit in maybe a 30-second glitz and headline.\u201d Tressie added, \u201cDonald Trump has played the incentives and fears of the media environment like a fiddle. Even when we know it, we can\u2019t stop dancing to his tune.\u201d\n\nThe discussion also touched on economic coverage, with Tressie urging a shift toward materialist perspectives that connect economic realities to voter behavior. She noted that economic anxieties are often misrepresented as simple inflation concerns, rather than part of broader social issues. Tressie highlighted the intersection of economic realities and feminist theory, arguing for a broader understanding of economic issues in media coverage. She noted that discussions about inflation often fail to capture the full impact of economic pressures on everyday life, particularly for women, saying \u201cInflation has become a stylized fact\u2014an easy explanation that often misses the deeper issue of economic struggle, like the high cost of care and the erosion of the social safety net.\u201d\n\nShe emphasized that many economic anxieties are rooted in the challenges of managing childcare, elder care, and the overall cost of work, pointing out that these issues are fundamentally linked to gender dynamics in society. Tressie argued that the lack of support systems disproportionately affects women and impacts voter behavior. She called for media coverage that addresses these economic realities more directly, offering a more comprehensive analysis that goes beyond the superficial narratives often found in campaign reporting.\n\nThe fireside chat concluded with an engaging Q&A session from the audience exploring media ethics, campaign effectiveness, and coverage gaps in the 2024 election. Attendees raised concerns about media's focus on poll-driven narratives, challenges in balancing critical reporting with objectivity, and the need for deeper coverage of economic and class issues. Tressie and Juliane emphasized that while campaigns can impact turnout, structural factors still favor certain candidates. They called for more nuanced reporting, particularly on underrepresented topics like climate change, economic struggles, and the roles of race and gender in voter decision-making.",

        "text": "Key facts about U.S. poll workers\nPoll workers assist voters during Super Tuesday elections on March 5, 2024, in Charlotte, North Carolina. (Grant Baldwin/Getty Images)\n\nMillions of Americans are heading to the polls, entrusting their ballots with local poll workers. But what exactly these poll workers do \u2013 and the requirements they must meet to assume this role \u2013 varies widely by state and county.\n\nOverall, U.S. registered voters tend to trust poll workers. Nine-in-ten registered voters say in a new Pew Research Center survey that they are at least somewhat confident that poll workers in their community will do a good job during this year\u2019s elections. In fact, voters are more likely to express confidence in poll workers than in state officials who run elections (90% vs. 81%).\n\nLarge majorities of voters who back Vice President Kamala Harris and those who back former President Donald Trump express at least some confidence in poll workers. But Harris supporters are much more likely than Trump supporters to say they are very confident (62% vs. 36%). Harris supporters are also more likely than Trump supporters to be very confident in state election officials (43% vs. 20%).\n\nHere are key facts about poll workers in the United States, including:\n\nWhat do U.S. election workers do?\n\nThere are three types of election staff, but poll workers account for the bulk of them:\n\nPoll workers are temporarily recruited to perform various duties on Election Day and the lead-up to it. Their duties can include setting up voting equipment, greeting or checking in voters, verifying voter IDs and registration, serving as language interpreters, counting ballots, and more. Poll workers hold different titles \u2013 such as election clerk, election judge, inspector, booth worker, warden or commissioner \u2013 depending on the state or county.\n\nare temporarily recruited to perform various duties on Election Day and the lead-up to it. Their duties can include setting up voting equipment, greeting or checking in voters, verifying voter IDs and registration, serving as language interpreters, counting ballots, and more. Poll workers hold different titles \u2013 such as election clerk, election judge, inspector, booth worker, warden or commissioner \u2013 depending on the state or county. Election officials are elected, appointed or otherwise hired to carry out specialized activities like recruiting and training poll workers and maintaining voter rolls. They work year-round, and many have additional duties beyond election administration.\n\nare elected, appointed or otherwise hired to carry out specialized activities like recruiting and training poll workers and maintaining voter rolls. They work year-round, and many have additional duties beyond election administration. Poll watchers are not typically government employees. They\u2019re generally appointed by political parties to observe the opening of the polls and ballot counting. They may be party or candidate representatives, members of nonpartisan groups, academics, or part of special interest groups with stakes in local ballot measures.\n\nHow many poll workers usually help in general elections?\n\nLooking at polling sites with available data, roughly 644,000 poll workers assisted with in-person and/or early voting in the 2022 general election. This includes data from 45 states and the District of Columbia collected by the U.S. Election Assistance Commission\u2019s Election Administration and Voting Survey (EAVS), a study conducted every two years to examine how states administer federal elections.\n\nData was unavailable for New Hampshire, Vermont and Wisconsin, as well as for the country\u2019s two fully vote-by-mail states: Oregon and Washington. (Hawaii, which is included in these figures, primarily conducts voting by mail but still has in-person voting at staffed polling sites.)\n\nBy comparison, about 774,000 poll workers helped in the 2020 general election, according to EAVS data from polling sites that provided this information in 44 states and D.C. (This total excludes data from the same states as in the 2022 survey, as well as Pennsylvania.)\n\nRelated: Republicans, Democrats continue to differ sharply on voting access\n\nWhich states have the most poll workers per polling site?\n\nD.C. topped the list with 23 poll workers per site in the 2022 general election. Colorado (15 per polling place), Nevada (14), New York, Maryland and Minnesota (12 each) rounded out the top six.\n\nIn 2022, 28 of the 45 states and D.C. with available data had fewer than eight poll workers per site. (This total includes Iowa, but some jurisdictions there did not report the number of poll workers they had that year.)\n\nAre poll workers paid?\n\nThe amount of compensation poll workers can receive varies widely by state and county. Minimum requirements are typically set on the state level \u2013 with some using the federal or state minimum wage as a basis \u2013 but local jurisdictions sometimes opt to pay their workers more.\n\nWhile election clerks in Delaware are entitled to a $300 stipend, for example, many poll workers in Alaska are eligible to make $20 an hour. Colorado law requires election judges to be paid at least $5 per day.\n\nPoll workers can also often be reimbursed for travel expenses or paid for completing trainings.\n\nSeveral states, including New Jersey, Oklahoma and Alabama, have raised their minimum compensation requirements for poll workers in the past few years to incentivize more recruits. Most recently, South Carolina\u2019s Election Commission requested a budget increase to fund a $40 daily raise for the Palmetto State\u2019s poll workers.\n\nWhat criteria must poll workers meet?\n\nAcross D.C. and the 48 states that have in-person voting, requirements vary widely \u2013 even for poll workers serving different roles in the same precinct. But some similarities emerge:\n\nAll states have minimum age requirements, most often set at 18, but many allow students as young as 16 to serve under certain limitations.\n\nmost often set at 18, but many allow students as young as 16 to serve under certain limitations. Forty-one states, plus D.C., explicitly require volunteers to be registered voters. In Minnesota, North Dakota and Wisconsin, they must at least be eligible to vote.\n\nIn Minnesota, North Dakota and Wisconsin, they must at least be eligible to vote. Every state but Hawaii \u2013 where voting primarily takes place by mail \u2013 has explicit residency requirements. States often mandate that poll workers reside in the county or precinct of the polling place, but many allow some flexibility for outsiders if there are volunteer shortages.\n\nStates often mandate that poll workers reside in the county or precinct of the polling place, but many allow some flexibility for outsiders if there are volunteer shortages. Poll workers are explicitly required to have a party affiliation in at least nine states. In about half of the 48 states that offer in-person voting, it\u2019s \u201cconsidered,\u201d \u201cpreferred\u201d or \u201cgenerally\u201d required unless there aren\u2019t enough volunteers who affiliate with a major party. Some states \u2013 such as New York , for example \u2013 require poll workers or election officials to equally represent the two major political parties, depending on the worker\u2019s position.\n\nin at least nine states. In about half of the 48 states that offer in-person voting, it\u2019s \u201cconsidered,\u201d \u201cpreferred\u201d or \u201cgenerally\u201d required unless there aren\u2019t enough volunteers who affiliate with a major party. Some states \u2013 such as , for example \u2013 require poll workers or election officials to depending on the worker\u2019s position. The vast majority of states require poll workers to undergo trainings, which are commonly held at the local level.\n\nwhich are commonly held at the local level. At least 37 states, plus D.C., require at least some poll workers in certain positions to swear an oath.\n\nArkansas poll worker oath \u201cWe, the undersigned, do swear that we will perform the duties of poll workers of this election according to law and to the best of our abilities, and that we will studiously endeavor to prevent fraud, deceit, and abuse in conducting the same, and we will not disclose how any voter shall have voted, unless required to do so as a witness in a judicial proceeding or a proceeding to contest an election.\u201d\n\nElected officials, candidates and their families, political action committee members, and people with felony records are typically barred from serving as poll workers. People who\u2019ve bet on elections or committed certain crimes are also sometimes prohibited.\n\nSome states also set additional \u201cgood reputation\u201d requirements. For example, poll workers in Georgia must be \u201cbe judicious, intelligent, and upright citizens\u201d while those in New Jersey must be \u201cof good repute and character.\u201d Virginia simply requires that they are \u201ccompetent citizens.\u201d\n\nWhat are common recruitment challenges?\n\nWhile Nebraska law allows counties to draft people \u2013 jury duty-style \u2013 to meet staffing needs, most U.S. poll workers are volunteers. With more than 94,000 polling sites to staff nationwide, recruiting enough people can be a challenge.\n\nSpecific hurdles, such as a lack of public awareness about the job or disinterest in the long hours and relatively low pay, have been widely cited by news outlets and research organizations. Public health was also a worrisome issue for poll workers \u2013 the majority of whom are older than 60 \u2013 during the 2020 election, which coincided with the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nPersonal safety concerns among poll workers also intensified that year and continue to linger. The Department of Justice recently warned that harassment against poll workers may persist \u2013 and potentially worsen with the use of AI \u2013 in the 2024 election. Many states have responded to these concerns, with 18 enacting legal protections for election officials and poll workers since 2020, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nCreative recruitment methods have subsequently cropped up in several states, such as enlisting military veterans for the job in the hopes of increasing public trust in poll workers. Election officials in places that allow younger workers have also recently pushed to mobilize college and high school students to volunteer at polling sites for the 2024 election.\n\nState Must be registered voter Residency requirement Party affiliation explicitly required Alabama Yes County, but precinct is sometimes prioritized Generally Alaska Yes Precinct; if insufficient staffing, can recruit district residents, then state residents Generally Arizona Yes Precinct, then county or other precincts Required for some positions Arkansas Yes Precinct, then county Generally California Yes State Colorado Yes State Generally Connecticut Yes Generally town or district Generally Delaware State District of Columbia Yes D.C. resident (except D.C. govt. employees) Florida Yes County Georgia Generally county for county residents or employees Hawaii Idaho No legal requirement, but precinct is the norm Preferred Illinois Yes Generally precinct, but county for some positions Required Indiana Yes County Iowa Yes Precinct preferred, then county Generally Kansas Yes Area of polling place or county Required Kentucky Yes Precinct, then county Generally Louisiana Yes Any precinct in ward; if insufficient staffing, can recruit residents from parish Required Maine Yes Municipality or county Required for clerks Maryland Yes County, then state Preferred Massachusetts Yes Commonwealth Preferred, but a limited number of nonaffiliated workers are allowed Michigan Yes State Required Minnesota * Precinct is the informal norm, but state is the requirement Required Mississippi Yes County Certain positions may only be filled by members of one political party if recruits with other party affiliations cannot be found Missouri Yes Jurisdiction, unless insufficient number found Generally preferred; Missouri election judges are required to provide their party affiliation.

In Texas and Virginia, poll workers must be \u201cqualified voters,\u201d which each state\u2019s election code defines as being a registered voter.\n\nNote: Washington and Oregon are vote-by-mail states without traditional poll workers; they are not shown. Voting primarily takes place by mail in Hawaii. Requirements may vary by poll workers\u2019 positions, and local jurisdictions may set their own additional requirements. Voting registration requirements may differ for student workers under 18 in states that allow them. States\u2019 residency requirements often allow those from elsewhere in the state (i.e., outside of the required precinct, county, etc.) to serve if not enough recruits can be found.\n\nSource: U.S. Election Assistance Commission\u2019s 2023 \u201cState-by-State Compendium of Election Worker Laws and Statutes\u201d; National Conference of State Legislatures\u2019 2022 \u201cElection Poll Workers\u201d report; news reports; and individual states\u2019 laws and Election Commission websites.\n\nNote: This is an update of an analysis originally published on July 25, 2024.

        "text": "US presidential election briefing: Early voting records smashed as Trump urges Republicans to head to polls early\nNearly 25 million Americans have already voted, less than two weeks out from the US election, with records broken in multiple battleground states, at least partly driven by Republicans embracing early voting at Donald Trump\u2019s direction.\n\nEither through in-person early voting or mail-in ballots, more than 1.9 million voters have cast early votes in Georgia, where Trump lost by a mere 11,779 votes four years ago to Democrat Joe Biden, while North Carolina also set a new record of more than 1.7m despite the chaos caused by Hurricane Helene last month.\n\nAt an event in Georgia, Trump celebrated the state\u2019s record-breaking vote levels, and at a separate rally urged his supporters to \u201cjust vote \u2013 whichever way you want to do it.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what else happened on Wednesday:\n\nDonald Trump election news\n\nA former model who says she met Donald Trump through the late sexual abuser Jeffrey Epstein has accused the former president of groping and sexually touching her in an incident in Trump Tower in 1993, in what she believed was a \u201ctwisted game\u201d between the two men. The Trump campaign called the allegations by Stacey Williams \u201cunequivocally false\u201d, calling it a fake story \u201ccontrived by the Harris campaign\u201d.\n\nTrump appeared in Zebulon, Georgia, with lieutenant governor and 2020 election denier Burt Jones , at a faith-focused event his campaign dubbed a \u201cBelievers and Ballots town hall\u201d. Trump praised tech mogul Elon Musk, for providing hurricane relief where he claimed the federal government did not.\n\nTrump stayed in Georgia for a rally in Duluth with guests Tucker Carlson, Robert F Kennedy Jr, and former congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard. He escalated his personal insults against Kamala Harris , saying she was \u201ccrazy\u201d and inviting voters to tell his opponent: \u201c\u2018You\u2019re the worst ever. There\u2019s never been anybody like you. You can\u2019t put two sentences together. The world is laughing at us because of you.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe US justice department warned Musk\u2019s Super Pac that the billionaire and Tesla CEO\u2019s $1m-a-day giveaways may violate federal law , according to multiple reports. Musk, who has thrown his support behind Trump, announced on Saturday while speaking before a crowd in Pennsylvania that he was giving away $1m each day until election day to someone who signs his online petition supporting the US constitution.\n\nWriting on Truth Social, Trump assailed John Kelly as a \u201ca bad general\u201d gripped by \u201cpure Trump Derangement Syndrome Hatred\u201d. Kelly, Trump\u2019s former chief of staff and a retired Marine general, on Tuesday said he believed Trump met the definition of \u201cfascist\u201d and was \u201ccertainly an authoritarian\u201d. Two retired army officers said they agreed with Kelly, while Republicans including the governor of New Hampshire dismissed the comments.\n\nKamala Harris election news\n\nKamala Harris denounced Trump as a \u201cfascist\u201d who wants \u201cunchecked power\u201d and a military personally loyal to him . In a surprise speech from her Washington DC residence, the Democratic nominee jumped on Kelly\u2019s claims. Joe Biden \u2019s press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, said the president also agreed with those calling Trump a fascist.\n\nHarris repeated the fascist claim during a televised town hall with undecided voters in Delaware County, outside Philadelphia, Pennsylvania . In response to CNN moderator Anderson Cooper asking her: \u201cLet me ask you tonight, do you think Donald Trump is a fascist?\u201d, Harris answered: \u201cYes, I do.\u201d Trump was invited to attend the same town hall but declined.\n\nHarris\u2019s campaign announced she will deliver a major \u201cclosing argument\u201d address next week in the same location that Donald Trump rallied January 6 rioters before they stormed the US Capitol in 2021.\n\nDemocratic vice-presidential nominee Tim Walz voted early along with his wife , Gwen, and son, Gus. Leaving the voting booth in St Paul, Minnesota, Walz said his vote was \u201can opportunity to turn the page on the chaos of Donald Trump and a new way forward\u201d.\n\nSecond gentleman Doug Emhoff, Harris\u2019s husband, rallied Democrats in Florida, marking a break from his recent stumping in more competitive states including Wisconsin, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. Both parties expect the Sunshine state to once more swing for Trump, but the Harris campaign\u2019s rare foray drew attention to the close Senate race between the Republican incumbent and Democratic challenger.\n\nElsewhere on the campaign trail\n\nThe Los Angeles Times opinion editor resigned after the newspaper\u2019s owner blocked the masthead from endorsing Kamala Harris for president. Mariel Garza said she was standing up against the decision by Patrick Soon-Shiong, the paper\u2019s billionaire owner. In a social media post, Soon-Shiong wrote that the Los Angeles Times editorial board had rejected a proposed alternative to a typical presidential endorsement editorial, which he described as \u201ca factual analysis of all the POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE policies by EACH candidate during their tenures at the White House\u201d.\n\nChina-linked social media bots are targeting Republicans including Marco Rubio, according to new research from Microsoft, while a senior US intelligence official said groups in Russia created and helped spread viral disinformation targeting Tim Walz.\n\nPennsylvania\u2019s highest court allowed people whose mail ballots were rejected on technicalities to cast provisional ballots, likely affecting thousands of early voters. The decision was another defeat for the Republican National Committee\u2019s legal campaign, after it argued some provisional ballots cast during the April primary should have been rejected.\n\nRead more about the 2024 US election:",

Trump asserts that these measures will not only restore jobs to American soil but also reduce inflation. Additionally, Trump has said he wants a more direct role in managing the Federal Reserve, telling CBS News \u201cI feel the president should have at least (a) say in there.\u201d\n\nVice President Kamala Harris proposes addressing higher prices at the grocery store by attacking what she says is price gouging by large grocery corporations, according to CBS News. Harris says she wants to target businesses that aren't \"playing by the rules\" and ensure there's competition in the industry to bring down costs. Her strategy also involves promoting housing affordability, reducing healthcare costs as well as revising Trump\u2019s signature tax cuts.

        "text": "October 24, 2024, presidential campaign news\nVice President Kamala Harris speaks with Pam Thistle after a CNN Presidential Town Hall in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, on Wednesday, October 23. Rebecca Wright/CNN\n\nSome voters who stayed to talk with CNN after the town hall with Kamala Harris on Wednesday in Pennsylvania said they have made up their mind. Two of five of the voters who spoke with CNN\u2019s John King are leaving the town hall planning to vote for Harris \u2014 but others said they still have major policy concerns.\n\nOne of the voters, Joe Donahue, did not raise his hand when asked if he was going to vote for Harris and said there are still some \u201cpersonal policy difference,\u201d specifically on abortion.\n\n\u201cThe right to life is so fundamental in this country that it becomes \u2014 without that right being respected, it\u2019s incredibly difficult to talk about anything else,\u201d Donahue said.\n\nStill, Donahue said he is still \u201cnot sold\u201d on former President Donald Trump either because \u201chis personality\u201d and his actions on January 6, 2021. Harris spoke with him after the town hall, which he said meant \u201cquite a bit\u201d to him and appreciated given the fact that they have opposing ideas.\n\nPam Thistle said she left the town hall with a \u201ca feeling of adoration\u201d for Harris personally, but as a widow raising children, the economy and paying her bills is her top concern: \u201cI really do have to vote for my family.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd another thing that is very much a turn off, and this is with both candidates \u2014 stop trashing each other. We don\u2019t care. Stop trashing Trump. Trump, stop trashing the vice president. We don\u2019t care,\u201d Thistle said, adding that\u2019s not what voters care about.\n\nTaneisha Spall echoed that sentiment, saying she would respect Harris more if she stayed out of the \u201cschoolyard bulling\u201d and ran on her policy positions. She said she doesn\u2019t feel like Harris needs to lodge attacks and that she thinks \u201cit\u2019s beneath her.\u201d\n\nErik Svendsen said he has decided to vote for Harris. He said hearing Harris admit that she doesn\u2019t know the answer to everything and she has people around her that she can trust resonated with him.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need a president that knows everything or thinks they know everything, because that\u2019s not what America needs,\u201d Svendsen said. \u201cThey need to put the right people in the right place to lead the country efficiently. One person can\u2019t lead this country, they need a team.\u201d",

The ETTF has led the Department\u2019s efforts to address threats of violence against election workers .",
        "text": "Justice Department Announces Four Cases Brought by Election Threats Task Force\nThe Justice Department\u2019s Election Threats Task Force (ETTF) announced developments this week in four cases involving interstate transmissions of threats to election personnel and other victims.\n\nTeak Brockbank, 45, of Cortez, Colorado, pleaded guilty today to threatening a Colorado election official and making other threats to an Arizona election official, a Colorado state judge, and federal law enforcement agents between September 2021 and July 2024.\n\nBrian Jerry Ogstad, 60, of Cullman, Alabama, was sentenced on Monday to 30 months in prison for sending messages threatening violence to election workers with Maricopa County Elections in Phoenix from Aug. 2-4, 2022, during and immediately following the Arizona primary elections.\n\nRichard Glenn Kantwill, 61, of Tampa, Florida, was charged on Monday for allegedly sending a threat on Feb. 9 to an election official in addition to already pending charges for threats made to three other victims based on their political commentary in 2019 and 2020.\n\nJohn Pollard, 62, of Philadelphia, was charged on Monday for allegedly threatening on Sept. 6 to kill a representative of a Pennsylvania state political party who was recruiting official poll watchers.\n\n\u201cAs we approach Election Day, the Justice Department\u2019s warning remains clear: anyone who illegally threatens an election worker, official, or volunteer will face the consequences,\u201d said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. \u201cOver the past three and a half years, the Justice Department has been aggressively investigating and prosecuting those who threaten the public servants who administer our elections, and we will continue to do so in the weeks ahead. For our democracy to function, Americans who serve the public must be able to do their jobs without fearing for their lives.\u201d\n\n\u201cThreats to election workers are threats to our democratic process,\u201d said Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco. \u201cNo one should face violence or threats of violence simply for doing their job. The actions announced today make clear that we will not tolerate those who use or threaten violence in an effort to undermine our democratic institutions. To carry out their essential work, election officials must be free from improper influence, physical threats, and others forms of intimidation.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur elections are made possible by the hard work and patriotism of election workers in communities across the country who are also our neighbors, relatives and friends, and they deserve to do this important work without being subjected to threats,\u201d said FBI Director Christopher Wray. \u201cThe fact that election workers need to be worried about their security is incomprehensible and unacceptable. While these four cases are examples of the kinds of threats election workers are unfortunately facing, these cases also represent the FBI\u2019s dedication in holding accountable those who undermine our democracy with this conduct. The FBI and our partners on the ETTF will work tirelessly to charge and arrest those callous enough to make these threats and make sure they are held accountable. Free, fair, and safe elections are critical to our country and our democratic ideals.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese defendants made serious threats of violence against members of the election community. Threats like these strike at the very heart of our democracy,\u201d said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri, head of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division. \u201cThe cases announced today underscore the Criminal Division\u2019s commitment to defending our democracy, safeguarding our elections, and protecting all election workers. Through the ETTF, the Department will vigorously investigate and prosecute all criminal threats against members of the election community.\u201d\n\nThe four cases were all brought by the ETTF. Created by Attorney General Merrick B. Garland and launched by Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco in June 2021, the task force has led the Department\u2019s efforts to address threats of violence against election workers, and to ensure that all election workers \u2014 whether elected, appointed, or volunteer \u2014 are able to do their jobs free from threats and intimidation. The task force engages with the election community and state and local law enforcement to assess allegations and reports of threats against election workers, and has investigated and prosecuted these matters where appropriate, in partnership with FBI Field Offices and U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices throughout the country. Three years after its formation, the task force is continuing this work and supporting U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices and FBI Field Offices nationwide as they join the task force in its critical work.\n\nUnder the leadership of the Attorney General and the Deputy Attorney General, the task force is led by the Criminal Division\u2019s Public Integrity Section (PIN) and includes several other entities within the Justice Department, including the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section, Civil Rights Division, National Security Division, and FBI, as well as key interagency partners, such as the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Postal Inspection Service. For more information regarding the Justice Department\u2019s efforts to combat threats against election workers, read the Deputy Attorney General\u2019s memo.\n\nUnited States v. Brockbank (District of Colorado)\n\nAccording to court documents, Brockbank admitted to using three social media accounts to post messages threatening Colorado and Arizona election officials between September 2021 and July 2024.\n\nOn Sept. 22, 2021, Brockbank posted the following message on social media:\n\n\u201c[Election Official-1] . . . needs to- No has to Hang she has to Hang by the neck till she is Dead Dead Dead. There will be accountability for these peoples actions in Communist Colorado and it won\u2019t be judges and it won\u2019t be weakmided cops that bring it!!! It will be Me it will be You it Will be every day people that understand that there life does not matter anymore with the future our country has laid out before it.\u201d\n\nAs part of his plea, Brockbank also admitted to posting a message on Aug. 4, 2022, referring to election officials in Arizona and Colorado, saying: \u201cOnce those people start getting put to death then the rest will melt like snowflakes and turn on each other. . . . This is the only way. So those of us that have the stomach for what has to be done should prepare our minds for what we all [a]re going to do!!!!!! It is time.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Brockbank admitted to posting a message threatening a Colorado state judge on Oct. 2, 2021, saying: \u201cI could pick up my rifle and I could go put a bullet in this Mans head and send him to explain himself to our Creator right now. I would be Justified!!! Not only justified but obligated by those in my family who fought and died for the freedom in this country. . . . What can I do other than kill this man my self?\u201d\n\nBrockbank further admitted to threatening federal law enforcement on July 13, posting: \u201cI believe every single FBI agent deserves to go explain themselves to our creator right away!!!! I am more than willing to send any/All of you there.\u201d\n\nFinally, Brockbank admitted to illegally possessing multiple firearms and ammunition.\n\n\u201cThe security and sanctity of the American election system is core to the foundation of our Democracy,\u201d said Acting U.S. Attorney Matt Kirsch for the District of Colorado. \u201cWe will prosecute people who threaten elections, election officials, or election workers to the fullest extent of the law.\u201d\n\nBrockbank pleaded guilty today to interstate transmission of a threat. He is scheduled to be sentenced on Feb. 3, 2025, and faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.\n\nThe FBI Denver Field Office is investigating the case.\n\nActing Deputy Director Jonathan E. Jacobson of PIN\u2019s Election Crimes Branch and Assistant U.S. Attorney Cyrus Y. Chung for the District of Colorado are prosecuting the case.\n\nUnited States v. Ogstad (District of Arizona)\n\nAccording to court documents, on or about Aug. 2, 2022, Arizona held primary elections for federal and state officeholders, including a gubernatorial primary election that received nationwide media coverage. From the day of the election through on or about Aug. 4, 2022, Ogstad sent multiple threatening direct messages to a social media account maintained by Maricopa County Elections. For instance, on or about Aug. 3, 2022, Ogstad stated: (1) \u201cYou did it! Now you are f*****.. Dead. You will all be executed for your crimes\u201d; (2) F*** you! You are caught! They have it all. You f****** are dead\u201d; (3) \u201cYou are lying, cheating m****** f******* . . . you better not come in my church, my business or send your kids to my school. You are f****** stupid if you think your lives are safe\u201d; and (4) \u201cYou f****** are so dead.\u201d On or about Aug. 4, 2022, Ogstad also stated, \u201c[Y]ou people are so ducking stupid. Everyone knows you are lots, cheats, frauds and in doing so in relation to elections have committed treason. You will all be executed. Bang f******!\u201d In the course of his messages to the recipient, Ogstad transmitted an image of the character \u201cWoody,\u201d from the Toy Story film franchise, lying face down with an unidentified projectile in its back.\n\n\u201cIn this election season we honor and respect those public servants who enable Americans to exercise their constitutional right to vote,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Gary Restaino for the District of Arizona. \u201cAnd we seek to protect all election workers from intimidation and harassment. Threats of violence, whether conveyed by words or deeds or pictures, will be met in this District with robust prosecution.\u201d\n\nOgstad was sentenced on Monday to 30 months in prison, followed by three years of supervised release and a $1,000 fine, after pleading guilty on July 25 to one count of interstate transmission of a threat.\n\nThe FBI Phoenix Field Office investigated the case, with substantial assistance from the FBI Birmingham Field Office.\n\nTrial Attorney Tanya Senanayake of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterterrorism Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Mary Sue Feldmeier for the District of Arizona prosecuted the case.\n\nUnited States v. Kantwill (Middle District of Florida)\n\nAccording to court documents, from September 2019 to July 2020, Kantwill, a dentist, sent over 100 threats to various public figures via Facebook and Instagram messages, email, and text. As charged in the superseding information filed on Monday, those threats included a threat sent via email to an author, a threat sent via text to a religious leader, and a threat sent via Instagram to a television personality. From April 2022 to April 2024, Kantwill also sent at least seven additional threats to four public figures via Facebook, including a threat to an election official in another state on Feb. 9, when Kantwill wrote: \u201cYou are a degenerate c***. and you are now the target of our own investigation. Take note because liberal t***s like you get raped in alleys, by really big black guys that serve our cause. So, you t*** are going to get raped by at least 5 n*****s, and do nothing. You are the number 1 target, you degenerate t***.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you threaten someone with violence, we will take you at your word,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Roger Handberg for the Middle District of Florida. \u201cLaw enforcement officers and members of my office will work together to hold accountable and federally prosecute individuals who threaten to injure or kill others.\u201d\n\nKantwill is charged with four counts of interstate transmission of a threat. If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison for each count. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.\n\nThe FBI is investigating the case.\n\nTrial Attorney Aaron L. Jennen of PIN and Assistant U.S. Attorney Abigail K. King for the Middle District of Florida are prosecuting the case, with assistance from Assistant U.S. Attorney Cyrus Y. Chung for the District of Colorado.\n\nUnited States v. Pollard (Western District of Pennsylvania)\n\nAccording to the indictment, on Sept. 6, Pollard sent threatening text messages to Victim 1, a resident of the Western District of Pennsylvania. Victim 1 had previously posted online, in Victim 1\u2019s capacity as an employee of a state political party, that Victim 1 was recruiting volunteers to \u201chelp[] observe at the polls on Election Day\u201d and included Victim 1\u2019s phone number. Pollard allegedly texted Victim 1 that he was \u201cinterested in being a poll watcher\u201d and included Victim 1\u2019s first name. Pollard then allegedly texted three threats to Victim 1: (1) \u201cI will KILL YOU IF YOU DON\u2019T ANSWER ME!\u201d; (2) \u201cYour days are numbered, B****!\u201d; and (3) \u201cGONNA F***ING FIND YOU AND SKIN YOU ALIVE AND USE YOUR SKIN FOR F***ING TOILET PAPER, YOU F***ING KKK**T!\u201d\n\n\u201cThreats of violence have no place in our society,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Eric G. Olshan for the Western District of Pennsylvania. \u201cThis is no less true when those threats of violence are directed at individuals associated with our electoral process \u2014 in this case, someone seeking to organize poll watchers. This conduct will not be tolerated in our district, and we will continue to work with our partners at the FBI to prosecute these offenses with the full weight of the law.\u201d\n\nPollard was arrested on Monday and appeared in federal court in Philadelphia. He is charged with one count of interstate transmission of a threat. If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.\n\nThe FBI Pittsburgh Field Office is investigating the case.\n\nTrial Attorney Jacob R. Steiner of PIN and Assistant U.S. Attorney Nicole A. Stockey for the Western District of Pennsylvania are prosecuting the case, with assistance from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.\n\n*****\n\nAn indictment or information is merely an allegation. All defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.\n\nTo report suspected threats or violent acts, contact your local FBI office and request to speak with the Election Crimes Coordinator.

        "text": "Most California Republicans in Congress won\u2019t commit to certifying the 2024 presidential election\nIn summary Only one-third of the California GOP congressional delegation has pledged to accept the 2024 presidential election results. And only two incumbents in office in 2021 voted to certify President Joe Biden\u2019s win over Donald Trump in the 2020 race.\n\nLea esta historia en Espa\u00f1ol\n\nIn January 2021, seven of the 11 California Republicans in Congress refused to certify the 2020 presidential election results, boosting former President Donald Trump\u2019s false claim that he lost in a rigged vote.\n\nNow, as Trump attempts a return to the White House, only a third of California\u2019s Republican U.S. representatives have pledged to certify the results this November.\n\nOnly four of the 12 GOP incumbents \u2014 who are all seeking another term \u2014 have promised to uphold the election results. Of the three GOP challengers in California\u2019s most competitive districts, two \u2014 Scott Baugh in Orange County and Kevin Lincoln in the Central Valley \u2014 made the same pledge in response to a CalMatters inquiry. And in California\u2019s U.S. Senate race, GOP candidate Steve Garvey made the commitment in February.\n\nThe refusal to commit by most GOP congressional candidates comes as Trump and his allies are already casting doubt on the outcome of the November election, stoking fear among election officials of disruptions and violence. Trump has peddled unsubstantiated claims about widespread voting by non-citizens, argued that Vice President Kamala Harris will only win if the Democrats cheat and questioned the constitutionality of Democrats replacing President Joe Biden at the top of the ticket.\n\nThe vote by Congress to count all electoral votes that are already certified by each state is the final step in electing a president. On Jan. 6. it will be one of the first major acts of the new Congress that will be sworn into office three days earlier. Usually a formality, it was anything but after Trump lost the 2020 election to Biden.\n\nOn Jan. 6, 2021, a mob of Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol. Early the next morning, 147 Republican members of Congress voted to object to the counting of Electoral College votes from either Arizona or Pennsylvania, or both.\n\nAll 44 California Democrats in the U.S. House and Senate at the time voted to certify the election.\n\nEight of California\u2019s current Republican members of Congress were in office, but only Rep. Young Kim \u2014 who flipped her northern Orange County seat in 2020 \u2014 voted to certify the results without casting doubt on the election outcome. \u201cThe constitution does not give Congress the authority to overturn elections. To take such action would undermine the authority of the states,\u201d she said in a statement in 2021.\n\nShe told CalMatters she plans to uphold the results of this election as well.\n\nRep. Tom McClintock was the only other California Republican to vote to certify the election. But he said it was because he believed Congress did not have the constitutional authority to reject the electoral votes \u2014 not because he didn\u2019t have concerns about how the election was conducted.\n\nIn December 2020, however, McClintock was one of four California Republicans in Congress to file an amicus brief with the U.S. Supreme Court to challenge the election outcome in Pennsylvania, arguing that mail balloting \u201cinvites fraud and incubates suspicion of fraud\u201d and claiming that \u201cballot harvesters\u201d collected ballots with \u201cno chain of custody.\u201d Multiple fact checks found no evidence that there was widespread ballot harvesting or voter fraud during the 2020 election, and courts rejected more than 50 lawsuits Trump and his allies brought to challenge the election results.\n\nMcClintock told CalMatters he will vote to uphold the electoral votes for the upcoming election. \u201cCongress\u2019 only role in the matter is to witness the counting of the ballots. Period,\u201d he said.\n\nYoung Kim, then a Republican candidate for Congress, during a candidate forum at the Richard Nixon Presidential Library in Yorba Linda, in 2018. Photo By Bill Clark, CQ Roll Call via AP Images\n\nIn 2022, Congress passed the Electoral Count Reform Act, which made it more difficult for Congress to object to election results and clarified the vote counting process. All California Republican incumbents who were in office at the time voted against it.\n\nBut even with that new guardrail, political experts say efforts to overturn the election are to be expected now. That\u2019s a stark departure from a decade ago, said Kim Nalder, political science professor at California State University in Sacramento.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really kind of horrifying that we\u2019ve normalized this abnormal sort of situation,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can\u2019t survive with this level of distrust in our basic institutions, and I don\u2019t know what will give to change that, but something has to.\u201d\n\nVeteran lobbyist Chris Micheli said the presidential election results could be challenged again, partly because of how close polls say the race is in seven battleground states. Both Harris and Trump are preparing legal teams in the case of a challenge.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a dark period of American history, both what transpired on Jan. 6, but also earlier that prior December, when members of Congress voted against certifying the election of the clear victor in the presidential election,\u201d Micheli said. \u201cThose votes raised the ire of a lot of voters, particularly in California.\u201d\n\nThe California Republican Party is confident that the election results will be certified, spokesperson Ellie Hockenbury said in a statement to CalMatters. Still, the party is preparing for issues that may arise.\n\n\u201cTo make sure we didn\u2019t leave anything to chance,\u201d she said, the national and state GOP \u201chave invested heavily in an Election Integrity operation to ensure that all concerns are addressed in real time and that Californians can cast a ballot with confidence that it will be received and counted.\u201d\n\nThe state Republican Party is firmly behind Trump, who \u2014 despite losing to Biden 63% to 34% in 2020 \u2014 still won more votes in California than any other state. In a new Public Policy Institute of California poll released Wednesday night, Harris leads Trump 59% to 33% among likely voters. But in the swing congressional districts, likely voters are generally evenly divided.\n\nRep. Ken Calvert, who represents the 41st District in Riverside County, is the only California Republican member of Congress to commit to certifying the presidential election results this time after objecting four years ago. He also joined in the court brief challenging Pennsylvania\u2019s results in 2020 and advocated for a \u201cthorough investigation\u201d of voter fraud allegations in 2021.\n\nCalvert\u2019s campaign did not say why his position has shifted from four years ago.\n\nRep. Jay Obernolte, who voted to object to the count, told Southern California News Group in 2022 that he still had \u201cserious constitutional reservations about the things that happened in those two states\u201d \u2014 Arizona and Pennsylvania.\n\nReps. David Valadao and Michelle Steel missed the vote in 2021. Steel said she had tested positive for COVID-19, while Valadao had not been sworn in yet because he also tested positive. However, Valadao said on social media he would have voted to certify the election.\n\nThe three incumbents who took office in 2023 will face that decision for the first time if they win re-election. But not everyone is answering the question: Rep. John Duarte \u2014 a Modesto farmer facing a fierce challenge from Democrat Adam Gray \u2014 is the only one to state his position publicly, telling The Sacramento Bee he would vote to certify the presidential election. (Duarte did not respond to a CalMatters inquiry.)\n\nReps. Kevin Kiley, Vince Fong, Doug LaMalfa, Darrell Issa and Mike Garcia, as well as Obernolte and Valadao, also did not respond to CalMatters inquiries. Matt Gunderson, a candidate for the toss-up 49th District in San Diego County, did not respond to CalMatters.\n\nRepublicans are reluctant to speak publicly about the issue because they\u2019re concerned about losing votes from Trump supporters, strategists say.\n\n\u201cIt puts Republicans in competitive districts in a difficult position,\u201d said Jon Fleischman, former executive director of the California Republican Party.\n\n\u201cOf course they\u2019re going to vote to certify the election results, but they don\u2019t really want to inflame the conservative grassroots side either, because they need them for their Get Out the Vote. So this is an issue that\u2019s divisive for Republicans, and so I don\u2019t think they want to talk about it much.\u201d\n\nFor Republicans running in swing districts, the answer to whether they will uphold the election outcome depends on which voters they want to court, Nalder said.\n\n\u201cComing out strongly in support of certification would make sense if the goal was to recruit some moderate voters or some voters from the other party in these close races,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if the strategy is more about turnouts amongst their base \u2026 it probably makes sense to equivocate.\u201d\n\nFor GOP members of Congress in safe Republican districts, however, the calculation is more about their \u201cfuture in the party,\u201d Nalder said.\n\n\u201cAssuming Trump wins, they will need to have loyalty exhibited within the party, and so having committed beforehand to something that the party maybe goes against later would not be helpful for their political career,\u201d she said.",

        "text": "The State of Domestic Terrorism as the U.S. Presidential Election Approaches\nIntelbrief / The State of Domestic Terrorism as the U.S. Presidential Election Approaches\n\nSHARE |\n\nThe State of Domestic Terrorism as the U.S. Presidential Election Approaches\n\nBottom Line Up Front With the U.S. presidential election weeks away, the risk of political violence remains high, and the environment in the United States is extremely volatile.\n\nPolitically motivated violent attacks, threats against local officials and poll workers, and heightened political rhetoric have increased in recent months, potentially resulting in increased violence from domestic extremists to election-related targets in the coming weeks.\n\nWhite supremacist and militia groups have particularly increased their disinformation campaigns and further mobilized in recent weeks, including intentionally spreading false narratives about Haitian migrants and Hurricane Helene relief.\n\nPotential election-related violence is not limited to far-right violent extremists, with an increased risk of both reciprocal radicalization \u2013 whereas far-right extremist activity fuels others across the ideological spectrum \u2013 and attempted plots by Islamic State.\n\nWith the U.S. presidential election weeks away, the risk of political violence remains high, the environment in the United States is extremely volatile. Politically motivated violent attacks have increased in recent months, including the two attempted assassinations on former President Donald Trump and attacks on a Democratic National Committee campaign office. Individuals have also committed violence against perceived political opponents, including the assault of a man in Pennsylvania rallying for Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 campaign and another run over with an all-terrain vehicle while putting up a political yard sign supporting Trump in Michigan.\n\nThere have been at least 51 incidents of political violence in the U.S. this year, according to a Reuters estimate. The uptick in violence is one of the most sustained increases in political violence since the 1970s and has led to rising concern among law enforcement and government officials. Both the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have raised concerns that \u201celection-related grievances,\u201d such as the belief in widespread voter fraud, could motivate extremists to commit violence in the weeks before and after the election, according to an intelligence bulletin issued by both agencies earlier this month. Extremists with \u201canger toward perceived political adversaries\u201d likely pose the largest threat and may target election-related sites in the coming weeks up through inauguration day in January, according to the bulletin. Attractive targets \u2013 as already seen in attempted attacks and violent incidents \u2013 could include political rallies, campaign events, ballot drop-off locations, and voter registration centers, among others.\n\nLocal officials and poll workers have also increasingly become the targets of death threats and potential violence. Thousands of local election workers have received violent and graphic threats since the 2020 election. The increased threat has led to law enforcement and other officials to increase security at election offices and for poll workers, including stationing local law enforcement at early voting sites and panic buttons connecting poll managers to a 911 dispatcher. Although the data is mixed on how often threats translate into actual violence \u2013 and thus if political violence is actually worsening \u2013 the threats have led to a chilling effect amongst local election workers and U.S. polling locations have struggled to hire workers.\n\nThis increase has occurred in parallel with a broader rise in threats toward public and government officials and law enforcement in recent years. A study conducted by researchers Pete Simi, Gina Ligon, Seamus Hughes, and Natalie Standridge examining federal charges found that over the last decade, 43 percent of threats made against public officials targeted law enforcement/military targets \u2013 including local police officers, federal agents, individuals working at military institutions in the U.S., district attorneys, and judges at all levels. Although the study found that the federal charges for threats made against public officials has been trending upward over the past decade, it sharply increased between 2017-2022, coinciding with the 2016 U.S. presidential election and the increased social polarization in subsequent years.\n\nAlthough threats against public officials have been on the rise alongside an uptick in politically motivated violent attacks, some data suggests that activity by violent extremist groups, including white supremacist and militia groups, has declined in recent years, according to Armed Conflict Location and Event Data (ACLED). Gaps in leadership following prosecutions from the January 6 Capital insurrection and a possible shift in tactics have possibly contributed to the decline in violent activity involving these groups, and their membership numbers, according to ACLED. Groups involved in January 6 have particularly lost steam, including the Proud Boys, Three Percenters, Oath Keepers, and members of the QAnon movement.\n\nDespite this decline, white supremacist and militia groups have recently increased their activities in the disinformation space and mobilized ahead of the election. In the weeks leading up to the presidential debate this summer, the neo-Nazi group Blood Tribe was amplifying disinformation and conspiracy theories around Haitian migrants in Ohio. The group posted on Telegram and Gab channels racist conspiracies about Haitians and Black people eating pets, and the rumor then made the leap to an X account popular in conservative circles \u2013 reaching at least 4.9 million views according to X\u2019s metrics. The day after the presidential debate, where former President Trump promulgated the story, Blood Tribe\u2019s leader Christopher Pohlhaus claimed credit on his Telegram channel, stating that Blood Tribe had \u201cpushed Springfield into the public consciousness.\u201d A member wrote on Gab that since \u201cthe president is talking about it now\u2026[t]his is what real power looks like.\u201d\n\nThere have also been reports of militia groups capitalizing on the hurricanes Helene and Milton, threatening to confront Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) workers and actively spreading disinformation about the relief response. Witnesses reported seeing a group of armed people harassing hurricane relief workers in Tennessee earlier this month, after reports emerged that FEMA workers aiding in the relief could be targeted by militia groups. Further, white supremacist and militia groups have also capitalized on the disasters and misinformation around the relief response as a recruitment tool. Groups such as the Patriot Front arrived in impacted communities to offer aid, while also filming propaganda videos to amplify disinformation narratives around the government response and to reframe their organizations as civic-minded. Despite their claims being refuted by local officials, these groups have posted videos on Telegram claiming to be among the few civilians aiding in disaster relief, exacerbating polarizing rhetoric around the government response. Some narratives have translated into widely spread conspiracies that the lack of response is related to intentionally decimating more politically right-leaning or conservative areas ahead of the election. These activities may potentially increase as the presidential election draws closer, particularly as groups have shown they can successfully mainstream their ideas and narratives \u2013 which can translate into threats or potential violence by other individuals \u2013 without having to be directly involved themselves. The ability of these groups to take their once fringe ideas into the mainstream can potentially insulate them from detection or prosecution, while still accomplishing their aims.\n\nDepending on the outcome of the election, and the activities of far-right extremist groups and militias, there is a risk of reciprocal radicalization \u2013 whereas far-right extremist activity fuels others across the ideological spectrum. Although most experts agree that far-right violent extremists still pose a greater threat domestically, increased far-right activity could lead to an increase in far-left violent extremist activity, or a mobilization of these groups. As the war in the Middle East drags on, the conditions for such activity could proliferate.\n\nMoreover, the threat of jihadist groups \u2013 such as Islamic State \u2013 may also increase as well. Islamic State \u2013 Khorasan (ISK) has recently reiterated its intent to target the United States through its platforms, with one poster depicting a militant holding a grenade in front of the U.S. Capitol building. The FBI also arrested an Afghan man in Oklahoma earlier this month who was planning an election day shooting on behalf of ISK, according to U.S. officials, highlighting how the threat of election-related violence is not limited to far-right violent extremists. As political rhetoric surrounding the election continues to heighten and, in some instances, evoke the existential \u2013 such as calls for holy war or execution of political enemies \u2013 the risk for violence surrounding the election may become more acute across the ideological spectrum.",

        "text": "Trying to Find Trump\u2019s Ground Game in Pennsylvania\n\u00d7 Expand Sean Simmers/The Patriot-News via AP Elon Musk speaks at Life Center Church in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, October 19, 2024. Musk and his super PAC have taken over Donald Trump\u2019s national canvassing effort.\n\nThis story is part of the Prospect\u2019s on-the-ground Election 2024 coverage. You can find all the other stories here.\n\nWILKES-BARRE, PENNSYLVANIA \u2013 My hometown in Northeast Pennsylvania is about as close to the epicenter of the 2024 presidential election as you can get. This is one of the swingiest regions in the most important swing state. As a result, every day my mailbox is stuffed with political mailers, my phone is ringing off the hook, and every day I get probably 20 or 30 text messages from campaigns, pollsters, and groups begging me to return my mail-in ballot NOW. (I will get around to it very soon, I promise.)\n\nThe ground game is a different story. While I have gotten entire forests\u2019 worth of conservative mailers, especially from local GOP Assembly candidate Dino Disler, I have only been door-knocked by liberals\u2014four times and counting, at the time of writing\u2014twice from the Harris campaign, and twice from the Progressive Turnout Project.\n\nThe lack of Republicans canvassing me could be because I\u2019m in their databases as a reliable Democrat. But if so, why am I getting so many conservative mailers? Furthermore, as I\u2019ve walked and driven around town, it\u2019s clear that Wilkes-Barre is simply crawling with liberal canvassers, who can be identified by their Harris-Walz merch, particularly the amusing camouflage hats. Even Christine Baranski, the Emmy Award-winning actress from The Good Wife and The Gilded Age, is knocking on doors in Wilkes-Barre, apparently to get out the Polish American vote (which is plentiful!).\n\nBut I have not seen a single Trump canvasser anywhere. The only conservative activist I\u2019ve seen was what appeared to be a middle-school age kid in a Trump costume sitting in the road median near a beer store waving some flags. (Alas, I neglected to get an interview, as I had other pressing business, and have not been able to find him again.)\n\nMore from Ryan Cooper\n\nLocal friends inform me that this was not the case in 2020 or 2016. Sean Cole, a volunteer working the desk at the Luzerne County Democratic Party office, told me that, despite the pandemic throwing a wrench into voter contact, there were plenty of Republican canvassers around that year. \u201cThis time, they\u2019re having to pay people,\u201d he said. \u201cAll our people are volunteers, and we\u2019ve got people from as far away as Colorado.\u201d\n\nWhat is happening? I reached out to the offices of a local Republican state Assembly member and a Republican state senator, with no luck. The same was true of the Republican National Committee, and the Pennsylvania GOP. Elon Musk\u2019s America PAC\u2014which, sure enough, is advertising $30 an hour to canvassers in swing states\u2014does not appear to have a press contact, though if it did it would probably respond with an automatic poop emoji. Staff at the Luzerne County Republican Party office informed me that journalists are not allowed in the building.\n\nFrom other reporting, it seems that Trump cronies and Musk, who is funding a large chunk of the operation himself, have thrown out the traditional playbook and opted for a highly unusual strategy of focusing their canvassing operation on a smaller group of people who are less likely to vote. A local Trump campaign official confirmed this narrative. \u201cThis time our ground game is more focused and targeted on low-propensity voters,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not flooding the zone,\u201d though he insisted that they did have people working doors in Wilkes-Barre.\n\nElon Musk has no prior experience in the logistics of a national canvassing operation.\n\nIt must be admitted that there\u2019s something to this argument. Repeatedly knocking on the door of someone who has already made up their mind and is certain to vote\u2014like myself\u2014is a waste of time. But not doing so is also risky. Democrats canvass likely Democratic voters to make sure they turn in their ballots early, or to find new volunteers, or just to make sure people have a plan to vote. In other cases, they target genuine swing voters, people who vote in elections but need some persuasion.\n\nTurning out low-propensity voters, by definition, is hard. Rural households are far apart, so canvassing time is less productive. For every actually certain partisan, you might miss a wobbly partisan, or a distracted one who would otherwise forget to turn in their ballot. We\u2019ll find out soon whether the Trump strategy worked out.\n\nRecall that back in February, Trump threw out Ronna McDaniel as the head of the RNC and replaced her with his daughter-in-law Lara Trump. The national canvassing effort was turned over to Turning Point USA, an outfit for conservative college students run by Charlie Kirk with no canvassing experience. That effort seems to have largely collapsed outside of Arizona, and Elon Musk has stepped into the void with his America PAC.\n\nThe Washington Post reported on America PAC last week. Musk, who is famously disdainful of advertising (Tesla doesn\u2019t do it at all), has focused mostly on mailers and canvassing. But he\u2019s also infamous for megalomaniac ambitions, slapdash technical execution, and impulsively firing contractors and staffers en masse. This has indeed happened at America PAC, as during the summer, Musk abruptly tossed three vendors who had been brought on to do canvassing work. Like Kirk, Musk also has no prior experience in the logistics of a national canvassing operation.\n\nThe Post followed a Musk canvasser in Wisconsin, who had been fired by one America PAC vendor only to be hired by another, and found her efforts stymied by an app that repeatedly glitched out and sent her to inappropriate doors. The Guardian reports that this may be due to the app\u2019s high bandwidth requirements. Remote rural areas\u2014like where low-propensity voters tend to live\u2014commonly have bad cellphone service.\n\nWorse, a separate Guardian report finds that nonpartisan employees pressured only to fill numbers on a spreadsheet may be resorting to faking the stats. About one-quarter of the door-knocks allegedly made in Arizona and Nevada could be \u201cpotentially fraudulent,\u201d sources and leaked data indicate.\n\nPerhaps as an insurance policy, Musk has started offering payments to Pennsylvania voters. He first offered $47 and then $100 to residents who would sign a right-wing petition, probably to get around the fact that vote-buying or payments to register to vote are against federal law (though lawyers argue this is still illegal). Musk then further offered a daily $1 million lottery drawing for one signee per day. That arguably also runs afoul not only of election law but also of state lottery regulations, which categorically ban all gambling operations that are not specifically authorized.\n\nLaws aside, this is comically at odds with the goal of targeting low-propensity voters. I would be shocked if thousands of liberals had not signed the petition simply to get the free $100 and a chance at a million bucks. Taken together, it all suggests an operation that, much like with Tesla\u2019s atrocious build quality, is not run by some engineering super-genius.\n\nAll of this is so far anecdotal, though it fits a pattern of reporting elsewhere. It\u2019s important to emphasize that ground campaigns do not win elections by themselves. Rather, they could give a campaign an extra point or two of turnout, if done well. Trump could well win without any ground game whatsoever. But all I\u2019ve seen here in Wilkes-Barre suggests to me an effort that is not going well on the Republican side.",

        "text": "New evidence China, Russia and Iran targeting US elections\nThere is new evidence China, Iran and Russia are aggressively expanding their efforts to influence American voters to potentially sway the result of the upcoming U.S. elections.\n\nTwo threat intelligence reports Wednesday, one from software giant Microsoft and the other from the cybersecurity firm Recorded Future, detail growing activity by cyber actors linked to each country \u2014 all aiming to impact U.S. public perceptions with less than two weeks before voters go to the polls.\n\nThe biggest change, according to Microsoft, comes from Chinese-linked actors known to researchers as Spamouflage or Taizi Flood.\n\n\u201cChinese influence operations have recently taken a new turn, shifting focus to several down-ballot candidates and members of Congress,\u201d Microsoft said, noting that starting in September, China has targeted at least four prominent Republican lawmakers, all of whom are known critics of the government in Beijing.\n\nMost recently, the Chinese-linked accounts targeted Texas Republican Michael McCaul, accusing the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee of \u201cabusing power for personal gain.\u201d\n\nLate last month, other Spamouflage began going after Tennessee Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn, Microsoft said. And earlier this month, the same effort began promoting Blackburn\u2019s opponent in the November 5 election.\n\nOther targets include Alabama Republican Representative Barry Moore, who was subjected to content criticizing his support for Israel, and the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Republican Marco Rubio, who was accused of corruption.\n\nThe Chinese Embassy in Washington rejected the allegations in the Microsoft report.\n\n\u201cThe presidential elections are the United States\u2019 domestic affairs,\u201d embassy spokesman Liu Pengyu told VOA Wednesday, echoing previous Chinese denials.\n\n\u201cSuch allegations are full of malicious speculations against China, which China firmly opposes,\u201d he added.\n\nU.S. lawmakers, however, said they were not surprised by the uptick in malign activity.\n\n\u201cThe CCP [Chinese Communist Party] cannot stand anyone who supports and gives a voice to those they oppress; their response is to sanction and attack,\u201d McCaul said in a statement to VOA.\n\n\u201cI consider it a badge of honor when the CCP \u2014 a leading abuser of human rights, censor of free speech, and oppressor of its own people \u2014 takes issue with my work,\u201d he said.\n\nRubio, the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, called for the Chinese influence efforts to \u201cbe taken very seriously.\u201d\n\n\u201cChina is becoming increasingly more aggressive,\u201d Rubio said in a statement to VOA. \u201cChina\u2019s goal is to shape American opinion on critical issues and target specific candidates, especially those they view as anti-China.\u201d\n\nGrowing threats\n\nThe reports from Microsoft and Recorded Future warn Beijing is not alone.\n\nSpecifically, the reports caution the Russian-linked cyber actors, known to researchers as Storm-1679 or Operation Overload, have increased their pace of operations over the past month and a half and are showing signs that more influence operations are on the way.\n\n\u201cOperation Overload is very likely to ramp up its activities,\u201d said the Recorded Future report.\n\nRecorded Future said many of the Russian efforts, of late, have sought to provoke anger toward the LGBTQ+ community \u201cusing disinformation to perpetuate discriminatory beliefs around transgender individuals, perceived behavioral issues, gender transition and reassignment surgeries, and pharmaceutical treatments.\u201d\n\nOther influence operations, the report said, are making use of AI-generated voiceovers to emulate the style of U.S. broadcast journalists.\n\nMicrosoft said the Russian cyber actors also have found ways to reach additional U.S. voters by shifting much of the content from the Telegram social media platform to X.\n\n\u201cStorm-1679 videos posted to X received higher levels of engagement,\u201d Microsoft said.\n\nMicrosoft researchers also warned there are signs Iran is also ramping up its election interference efforts.\n\nThe Microsoft report says that in one instance, less than two weeks ago, \u201can online persona operated by Iran began falsely posing as an American and called on Americans to boycott the elections due to both candidates\u2019 support for Israel\u2019s military operations.\u201d\n\nRussia and Iran, like China, have repeatedly denied any involvement in efforts to meddle with the U.S. election.\n\nBut the new findings from Microsoft and Recorded Future align with assessments from U.S. intelligence officials.\n\n\u201cForeign actors \u2014 particularly Russia, Iran and China \u2014 remain intent on fanning divisive narratives to divide Americans and undermine Americans\u2019 confidence in the U.S. democratic system consistent with what they perceive to be in their interests,\u201d according to a declassified assessment issued Tuesday by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.\n\nU.S. intelligence officials have previously said Russia has been working to boost the chances of former president and current Republican nominee Donald Trump, while Iran has been working to hurt Trump\u2019s reelection bid and instead buoy the campaign of Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee.\n\nAnd while there is little evidence to suggest China has sought to affect the U.S. presidential race, intelligence officials have said Beijing has been focusing its efforts on congressional and state and local candidates perceived to be promoting policies detrimental to Beijing's interests.",

        "text": "Outside of the U.S., how do leaders view Harris and Trump? \u2014 Harvard Gazette\nNext month\u2019s U.S. presidential election is being closely watched across the world. But do foreign governments have a clear preference for either Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Donald J. Trump?\n\nAccording to the Oct. 9 Weatherhead Center for International Affairs forum on the election\u2019s geopolitical stakes, many international observers remain ambivalent on the race. The panel featured four experts weighing in on the global hotspots of China, Russia, the Middle East, and Latin America.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin is probably inclined toward Trump, according to Timothy J. Colton, the Morris and Anna Feldberg Professor of Government and Russian Studies Chair of the Harvard Academy for International and Area Studies. \u201cBut the Russians will point out that Trump, in the end, did Russia no favors in his first term,\u201d Colton said. \u201cAt least at the leadership level, they\u2019re by and large convinced nothing good is going to come in the election from Russia\u2019s point of view.\u201d\n\nAt the moment, Moscow appears less invested in the U.S. election than in the last two cycles, Colton observed. \u201cThe Russians have turned away almost every shred of cooperation with the United States of America, and at least verbally and rhetorically they are fashioning a pretty radical new image of where they belong in the world.\u201d As examples, he cited top thinkers in Russia who speak of becoming an Asian country and Putin himself describing it as a civilization state, or a unique culture descended from an empire much like China.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Colton added, the Russian establishment sees far more opportunity in countries like Germany, Hungary, and the Czech Republic for undermining support for Ukraine. \u201cIt is reasonable to expect the war in Ukraine will come to an end, or at least to a point of suspension, in the next U.S. presidential term,\u201d he added. \u201cBut my own sense is the geopolitical outcome will depend more on what happens on the battlefield than on anything that happens in Washington.\u201d\n\nMost pressing in the Middle East is the escalating conflict involving Israel, Hezbollah, Hamas, and Iran. Ziad Daoud, a senior fellow with the Middle East Initiative at the Kennedy School\u2019s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, described a prevailing sense of fury amid another crisis in the Arab world. \u201cThis dissatisfaction could multiply if we get a condition in which you have loss of territory in Gaza or in the West Bank or in Lebanon, or you have displacement of people from Gaza or the West Bank or Lebanon,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Daoud, the central question is: Which U.S. presidential administration could help secure a favorable resolution for all parties? As a model, he pointed to the \u201cfive no\u2019s\u201d offered last year by National Security Council member Brett McGurk: \u201cNo forced displacement, no reoccupation, no reduction in territory, no threats to Israel, no besiegement.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are people who say President Trump is averse to war and therefore he\u2019s more likely to end the war,\u201d offered Daoud, who is also the chief emerging markets economist at Bloomberg. \u201cBut there are others who say that President Trump may not be as committed to the \u2018five no\u2019s\u2019 outlined by the U.S. administration last year. Yes, the ceasefire might be reached but the conditions may not be great, and that might lead to further disruption down the road.\u201d\n\nFor countries south of the U.S., the issues of drug trafficking and illegal corridors are far more central than immigration, according the Columbian journalist Diana Dur\u00e1n Nu\u00f1ez, currently a fellow with Harvard\u2019s Nieman Foundation for Journalism. \u201cIf the U.S. really wants to see a different outcome on immigration, they need to raise concern and interest among their partners in Latin America,\u201d she said.\n\nThe former TV news reporter also noted the growing influence of China, highlighting Nicaragua and Venezuela as two of the Asian country\u2019s key allies. But the region\u2019s ever-shifting political allegiances could hold new possibility for U.S. interests. \u201cLatin America is a complex compound of left-wing, right-wing, and authoritarian governments,\u201d Dur\u00e1n Nu\u00f1ez said, pointing to the U.S. military\u2019s new naval base partnership with Argentina\u2019s right-wing president, Javier Milei. \u201cChina was supposed to be the ally for that project \u2014 there had already been conversations, and they were quite advanced \u2014 but Milei stopped it.\u201d\n\nAs for China itself, an obvious concern is U.S. trade policy, given Trump\u2019s proposal of a 60 percent tariff on imports from the country. Rana Mitter, the Kennedy School\u2019s S.T. Lee Chair of U.S.-Asia Relations, emphasized that neither U.S. presidential candidate stands for 1990s-style free trade with China. For example, a Harris administration is expected to pursue more restrictions than the Biden administration on tech investments and intellectual property transfers involving China. \u201cBut that lies in contrast with what we are promised by people involved with a Trump II administration,\u201d he said.\n\nMitter, who recently visited the Chinese capital, noted how closely elites there are following the U.S. presidential race. \u201cThe only place where I\u2019ve seen as much interest as there is on, say, CNN, is in some of the think tanks of Beijing,\u201d he said. \u201cMany people, very well informed about U.S. politics, wanted to talk about the subject and gave highly granular accounts of voting patterns in various Pennsylvania and Wisconsin counties.\u201d\n\nBut these sophisticated observers favor neither candidate. \u201cThe majority view,\u201d Mitter said, \u201cwas that it might not make that much difference on the grounds that relations between the U.S. and China will be turbulent for quite some time.\u201d",

But one group of voters with the potential to affect the outcome is less likely to show up at the ballot box: those between the ages of 18 and 29.\n\nIn 2016, 90% of young Americans reported an interest in politics and 80% intended to vote, but only 43% did so, John Holbein, associate professor of public policy, politics and education at UVA\u2019s Frank Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy, noted in his 2020 book, \u201cMaking Young Voters: Converting Civic Attitudes into Civic Action.\u201d\n\nUVA Today checked in with Holbein to see what\u2019s going on with today\u2019s young voters.\n\nJohn Holbein, associate professor of public policy, politics and education at UVA\u2019s Frank Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy, says young people are especially sensitive to how difficult it is to register to vote. (Contributed photo)\n\nQ. Since the \u201cyouth vote\u201d became a thing in 1972, both major parties have made considerable efforts to win over 18- to 29-year-old voters. How large of a voting bloc is that group, and could it be a major influence in a national election?\n\nA. According to some estimates, Generation Z makes up approximately 20% of the U.S. population. Recent population estimates suggest that more than 30 million Gen Z citizens will have an opportunity to cast a ballot in 2024.\n\nMillennials now are the largest demographic group in the United States, having just surpassed Boomers in 2020. That\u2019s enough voters to sway the election. The open question is, \u201cWill young voters actually show up and cast a ballot?\u201d History suggests not, given that low rates of youth voter turnout are the norm.\n\nQ. Why has the youth demographic not turned out in significant numbers for most U.S. elections? Do other countries have similar turnouts among younger voters?\n\nA. Youth voter turnout is distinctly low in the United States. The \u201cage gap\u201d in turnout rates between old and young voters is the largest in the United States when one compares to other (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries. There probably are myriad reasons for this gap, including \u2013 but not limited to \u2013 the registration barriers that are unique to the United States.\n\nQ. Are there programs or efforts that are effective at turning out more youthful voters?\n\nA. My research showsthat young people are especially sensitive to how difficult it is to register to vote. Reforms that make registering easier, like same-day registration and preregistration of 16- and 17-year-olds, have been shown to be especially effective at raising youth voter turnout.\n\nQ. How would a stronger youth vote likely affect an election?\n\nA. Young people skew heavily Democratic. Youth report voting for Democrats at a 2-to-1 margin. Youth turnout could be the difference between a Democrat winning or losing. That being said, it should be acknowledged that many marginal young voters are Republicans.",

In the final runup to the election day, we aim to provide a brief analysis regarding the implications of both candidates\u2019 proposed immigration policies and the way they would likely change the US immigration system.\n\nDonald Trump\n\nProposed Immigration Policies\n\nTrump\u2019s immigration campaign promises revolve around reinstating and expanding on the immigration policies of his first presidential term, including using executive authority to finish the US Mexico border wall and carrying out what would be the largest domestic deportation operation in American history (estimated as deporting approximately 11 million migrants deemed unauthorized from the US in a multi-year military campaign).\n\nProject 2025 \u201cMandate for Leadership\u201d is a political initiative published by the conservative think tank, The Heritage Foundation, which was published in 2023. Although it has not been publicly endorsed by Trump, it has received a lot of attention for being a detailed agenda for a second Trump term. The \u201cMandate for Leadership\u201d does not include specific plans for how the government would carry out mass deportation, however the guide does lay out key immigration proposals. It proposes doing away with the Flores settlement, a legal agreement that established national minimum standards for the treatment of detained immigrant children, and reinstating the \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d immigration policy that was implemented in January 2019 under Trump which requires migrants seeking asylum to remain in Mexico until their US immigration court date. It also includes proposals to penalize countries for refusing to accept deportees from the US and forcing states and cities that receive Federal Emergency Management Agency grants to share databases with the federal government for immigration enforcement purposes. Strikingly, the guide also includes mention of directives for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials to take all unauthorized immigrants who have criminal records, prior deportation orders, or who have been identified by local police under 287(g) agreements (which authorize ICE to delegate to state and local law enforcement officers the authority to perform immigration officer functions under the agency\u2019s oversight) into custody.\n\nFurthermore, the guide calls for reducing or eliminating many paths to legal status, including eliminating pathways using parole authority, lowering refugee admissions, stripping away Temporary Protected Status, eliminating or greatly reducing the number of student visas issued to foreign students from certain countries, and reducing family-based immigration. The \u201cMandate for Leadership\u201d even includes a proposal to significantly reduce eligibility for T visas and U visas for survivors of trafficking and violence against women.\n\nWork visas would be no exception, as Project 2025 calls for the Department of Labor to lower the issuance of H2-A and H2-B \u201clow-skilled\u201d seasonal work visas, with an aim toward eliminating both visa types, and calls for lower H1-B \u201chigh-skilled\u201d visas. Overall, this generally means that fewer junior-level immigrants would be legally allowed to work and only senior-level immigrants and immigrants with extraordinary ability would be spared from facing further barriers to pursuing work opportunities in the US.\n\nChallenges and Pushback\n\nClearly, the biggest obstacle of a mass deportation effort would be resource constraints. It would likely require billions of dollars as well as space and facilities to logistically detain and process millions of people. To this end, Project 2025 calls on Congress to raise ICE\u2019s budget and to increase its detention capacity to 100,000 beds. It also calls for loosened detention standards and for ICE to be allowed to operate less regulated facilities, although it does not explicitly call for camps to be constructed.\n\nAmongst the myriad ways in which these proposed immigration policies would garner pushback, mass deportation efforts would expectedly give rise to great public opposition and be challenged in court. Like many of Trump\u2019s immigration efforts in his first term, his efforts to follow through on his campaign promises would be met with many court challenges, such as his promise to sign an executive order to end birthright citizenship for \u201cillegal aliens\u201d which would face significant legal hurdles as birthright citizenship is enshrined in the Constitution.\n\nKamala Harris\n\nProposed Immigration Policies\n\nHarris, as Vice President under President Joe Biden, has not overseen the border\u2014that is the responsibility of the commissioner for US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and the National Security Council senior director for transborder security. Rather, Harris has been tasked with a diplomatic assignment to reduce the incentives migrants have to leave Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, by enhancing lawful pathways for migration to the US and by strengthening ties with and supporting improved living conditions in these countries.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Harris has said that as President she would advocate for the bipartisan border bill that stalled in Congress due to Republican opposition. Harris has made the failed bipartisan border deal a focal point of her platform\u2212underscoring that it would have tightened asylum rules, allowed for partial border shutdowns if crossings rose above a certain threshold, and significantly increased funding for immigration review, including funding to hire more judges, and to combat drug trafficking, including improving fentanyl detection technology. The bipartisan border deal has come to reflect Harris\u2019 proposed immigration agenda for 2025: a mix of tough border restrictions\u2212distinguishing herself from Biden by adopting an enforcement-first approach to immigration\u2212and policies to support lawful pathways for migration. She says she will work to make sure the bipartisan border deal lands on her desk and has pledged to sign it.\n\nAs detailed in the bipartisan border deal, Harris proposes $20 billion in funding for increased border protection, and almost $8 billion in emergency funding for ICE, including funds to expand the capacity of detention facilities to 50,000 beds (an increase of 47 percent from the 34,000 beds allocated in 2023, 2022, and 2021). Her other immigration proposals include a higher standard for asylum eligibility that will require asylum seekers to establish a \u201creasonable possibility\u201d that their asylum application will be approved, which will be a more difficult bar to meet than the current \u201csignificant possibility\u201d standard, implementing an asylum protection determination procedure which would involve a six-month process conducted exclusively by asylum officers outside of the immigration court system as an alternative to expediated removal, and grants of conditional permanent resident status to Afghan foreign nationals who fled to the US following the withdrawal of the US military in 2021.\n\nRegarding work visas, Harris\u2019 policy proposal is to create 250,000 green card\u2013eligible employment-based and family visas over the next five years. This immigration proposal would increase employment-based visas by 13 percent and family-based visas by 7 percent by 2030.\n\nChallenges and Pushback\n\nAlthough Harris may aim to get the bipartisan border deal on her desk and to deliver on her other immigration proposals it is unclear whether she would be successful as Congress has not passed a comprehensive immigration reform package in decades and Republicans are unlikely to give her such an important political victory.\n\nApart from the challenge of securing bipartisan cooperation, Harris\u2019 policies are less likely to provoke as much public opposition. Unlike Trump, Harris\u2019 plan takes into the account the reality that although businesses across the country were shuttered in early 2020 by the pandemic, in the recovery American companies have created more jobs than there are unemployed people to fill them. As the draw of work opportunities continues to attract migrants to the US and employers\u2019 need for more people to do the work persists, increased pathways for legal migration will benefit US employers and the economy.\n\nFor advice on US immigration matters contact your Laura Devine Immigration attorney or enquiries@lauradevine.com.",

        "text": "US presidential election updates: Polls show historic gender split between Trump and Harris voters\nDonald Trump has been working tirelessly to win over male voters and by some measures his efforts appear effective, but it may have come at the cost of female support. According to a USA Today/Suffolk University poll, Trump is besting Kamala Harris among men by 53% to 37%, while the Democratic candidate is winning among women 53% to 36%.\n\nBut despite multiple polls showing the gender gap among voters widening to historic levels, Harris has said she doesn\u2019t see the phenomenon borne out at her rallies. \u201cWhat I am seeing is in equal measure, men and women talking about their concerns about the future of our democracy.\u201d\n\nBoth Harris and her Republican challenger spent the past day at rallies across battleground states. With only days to go until the election, a poll from Bloomberg News and Morning Consult finds that the 2024 presidential race is still too close to call.\n\nHere\u2019s what else happened on Thursday:\n\nKamala Harris election news\n\nBruce Springsteen and Barack Obama appeared alongside Harris at a star-studded campaign event in Clarkston, Georgia . The event launched the Democratic campaign\u2019s series of battleground state concerts. The actor Samuel L Jackson, director Spike Lee, senators Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, and actor Tyler Perry also spoke at the rally.\n\nAbout 20,000 people attended the Georgia event, according to the Harris campaign, which would make it her largest political rally yet . Bruce Springsteen urged voters to back Harris in the presidential election, warning that Trump is a would-be \u201ctyrant\u201d. Early voting totals have been breaking records in Georgia, with about 30% of the electorate having already cast ballots.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 will reportedly join Harris at her rally in Houston on Friday , continuing the celebrity pile-in. Harris is rallying in Texas, a Republican stronghold, to highlight abortion rights and support the Democratic Senate candidate Colin Allred, who trails the Republican Ted Cruz in opinion polls.\n\nHarris picked up the endorsement of two Republicans: one a former congressman from Michigan, the other a mayor in a pivotal county in Wisconsin. The former congressman Fred Upton said Trump was \u201ctotally unhinged\u201d, adding: \u201cWe don\u2019t need this chaos. We need to move forward, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m where I am.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump election news\n\nTrump said he would order the immediate firing of the special counsel Jack Smith if he were re-elected in the clearest expression of his intent to shut down the two criminal cases brought against him. The power to fire the special counsel formally rests with the attorney general, but Trump has made no secret of his intention to appoint a loyalist in that role.\n\nTrump, campaigning in the border swing state of Arizona, called the country a \u201cgarbage can\u201d because of immigration policies under the Biden administration. He laid out a host of policies including invoking the death penalty for any migrant who kills an American citizen and hiring 10,000 more border agents and increasing their pay.\n\nLater, Trump appeared at another rally organised by the conservative group Turning Point Action in Nevada. The United for Change event in Las Vegas drew thousands of supporters. The group, founded by conservative provocateur Charlie Kirk to engage young conservatives, has been working to help turn out voters on Trump\u2019s behalf.\n\nElsewhere on the campaign trail\n\nMail-in ballots have been damaged after a man set fire to a postal collection box in Arizona. Phoenix police arrested Dieter Klofkorn, who admitted to the crime and said his actions were not politically motivated.\n\nElon Musk gave another $44m to his pro-Donald Trump spending group during the first half of October, federal disclosures showed. The contributions, disclosed in a filing to the Federal Election Commission by Musk\u2019s America PAC group, come after a prior report showed he gave the group around $75m over three months between July and September.\n\nRead more about the 2024 US election",

        "text": "Election 2024: Berkeley scholars explore the complex dynamics of a historic campaign\nWhile few would have expected this year\u2019s presidential campaign to be tame, the run-up to Nov. 5 has brought historic levels of tumult, from May\u2019s felony conviction of Donald Trump to the July announcement that Kamala Harris would replace Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee \u2014 and now fears of interference and violence that could disrupt the election itself.\n\nAs election day nears, Trump and Harris appear deadlocked in the swing states that will likely decide the race. UC Berkeley experts have been following the developments closely, working to understand the forces swaying the American electorate and what\u2019s next for our polarized nation.\n\nTheir work spans the breadth of academic disciplines, from political science and law to computer science, psychology, history and journalism. Berkeley scholars have undertaken cross-disciplinary efforts on broad subjects like disinformation and free speech, resulting in research and policy recommendations with far-reaching impact. They\u2019ve analyzed what Trump\u2019s historic felony conviction could mean for the rule of law and the linguistic roots of what Harris\u2019 voice reveals about her identity. They\u2019ve compared the history of fascism to our present era, examined what it takes to keep liberal democracies alive, and considered the role that racial resentment has played in the Jan. 6 rebellion and the MAGA movement.\n\nAnd they\u2019ve taken an influential role in shaping the discussions and the interventions that could help us bridge our troubling divides and come together again as a community and a nation.\n\nBelow, read more about work UC Berkeley researchers have done related to the election, democracy, and more.",

        "text": "Washington Post won\u2019t endorse candidate in 2024 presidential election after Bezos decision\nNew York CNN \u2014\n\nFor the first time in decades, The Washington Post will not endorse a candidate in this year\u2019s presidential election, the newspaper\u2019s publisher announced Friday, a decision that sparked widespread outrage among the paper\u2019s staffers.\n\n\u201cThe Washington Post will not be making an endorsement of a presidential candidate in this election. Nor in any future presidential election,\u201d Post publisher Will Lewis said in a statement. \u201cWe are returning to our roots of not endorsing presidential candidates.\u201d\n\nThe Post reported the decision not to endorse was made by the newspaper\u2019s billionaire owner, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, citing two sources briefed on the matter.\n\nThe Post\u2019s editorial page staffers had drafted an endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris and it was ready to be approved by its board, but the draft was never presented, a person with knowledge of the matter told CNN.\n\n\u201cMany on the editorial board are surprised and angry,\u201d the person said.\n\nThe Post has endorsed a presidential candidate in every election since the 1980s. In his statement, Lewis referred to the Editorial Board\u2019s past decisions to not endorse a candidate, noting that it is a right \u201cwe are going back to.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe recognize that this will be read in a range of ways, including as a tacit endorsement of one candidate, or as a condemnation of another, or as an abdication of responsibility. That is inevitable,\u201d Lewis continued. \u201cWe don\u2019t see it that way. We see it as consistent with the values The Post has always stood for and what we hope for in a leader: character and courage in service to the American ethic, veneration for the rule of law, and respect for human freedom in all its aspects.\u201d\n\nNewspaper owners typically play a role in their publication\u2019s endorsements and sign off on the editorials, which are seen as a reflection of their views.\n\nOne journalist at the Post told CNN that the Harris campaign did not engage with the editorial board as part of the endorsement process. Another Post source said the paper had sought to meet with both campaigns but did not meet with either candidate. A spokesperson for the newspaper did not comment.\n\nAhead of Friday\u2019s announcement, the Post\u2019s editorial page editor, David Shipley, told staffers that Lewis would be publishing a public note with the decision.\n\n\u201cThe news is significant - and I know there will be strong reactions across the department,\u201d Shipley wrote in a memo.\n\nRobert Kagan, an opinion editor-at-large at the Post who resigned Friday in protest after the announcement, said Bezos made the decision to appease Trump.\n\n\u201cThis is obviously an effort by Jeff Bezos to curry favor with Donald Trump in the anticipation of his possible victory,\u201d Robert Kagan told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett OutFront. \u201cTrump has threatened to go after Bezos\u2019 business. Bezos runs one of the largest companies in America. They have tremendously intricate relations with the federal government. They depend on the federal government.\u201d\n\nThe move was also denounced by Marty Baron, the Post\u2019s former executive editor who led the newspaper through its coverage of the January 6, 2021, attack.\n\n\u201cThis is cowardice, with democracy as its casualty. Donald Trump will see this as an invitation to further intimidate owner Bezos (and others),\u201d Baron wrote in a social media post. \u201cDisturbing spinelessness at an institution famed for courage.\u201d\n\nUnder Baron, the paper went on to win a Pulitzer Prize for public service for its coverage of the assault on the US Capitol, which it described as an \u201cattempted coup.\u201d\n\nDuring Trump\u2019s presidency, he famously feuded with Bezos, especially when it came to the e-commerce giant Amazon. Trump called the Post \u201cThe Fake News Washington Post\u201d and derided it as Amazon\u2019s \u201cchief lobbyist.\u201d\n\nTrump directly accused Amazon of not paying enough in taxes and taking advantage of the US Postal Service. The Trump administration also blocked Amazon\u2019s $10 billion cloud computing contract with the Pentagon, which was widely seen at the time as Trump seeking retribution against Bezos over the Post\u2019s reporting.\n\nIt was Bezos, Baron wrote in his book \u201cCollision of Power,\u201d who ultimately helped decide on the Post\u2019s \u201cDemocracy Dies in Darkness\u201d slogan that was adopted during the Trump era.\n\nBut Trump has vowed to weaponize the government and seek vengeance against his perceived enemies and critics if he is reelected in November. Hours after the Post announced its decision Friday, Trump greeted executives from Blue Origin, the space exploration company owned by Bezos, the Associated Press reported. The company has a $3.4 billion contract with the federal government to build a new spacecraft to shuttle astronauts to and from the moon\u2019s surface.\n\nIn Washington, Bezos\u2019s decision not to endorse in the 2024 race left some members of the Post\u2019s editorial department feeling blindsided and disgusted, multiple sources told CNN. \u201cWe are furious,\u201d one writer said.\n\nA group of 13 Post opinion columnists later published a statement condemning the decision as \u201ca terrible mistake.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt represents an abandonment of the fundamental editorial convictions of the newspaper that we love, and for which we have worked a combined 218 years,\u201d they wrote.\n\nAnother staffer, invoking the Post\u2019s slogan, said, \u201cDemocracy doesn\u2019t die in darkness, it dies when people anticipatorily consent to a fascist\u2019s whims.\u201d Other Post staffers publicly expressed their dismay.\n\n\u201cThe paper I\u2019ve loved working at for 47 years is dying in darkness,\u201d David Maraniss, a Pulitzer Prize-winning editor, wrote in a social media post.\n\nAnother Washington Post journalist, speaking on condition of anonymity, told CNN they had mixed feelings about the decision.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad the Post isn\u2019t going to endorse anymore. But, what an awful time and way to roll that out,\u201d the person said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve read the Post for the last few years and all the facts the news side has uncovered, I\u2019m not sure you need the editorial board to tell you what to do.\u201d\n\nThe decision comes just days after The Los Angeles Times owner Patrick Soon-Shiong blocked the newspaper\u2019s planned endorsement of Harris, leading to resignations from three editorial board members.\n\nMajor US newspaper chains have also scaled back on presidential endorsements in recent years. McClatchy and Alden Global Capital, which owns hundreds of newspapers across the country, have ended the practice. Earlier this year, the New York Times announced it would no longer endorse in local races, though it later endorsed Harris as \u201cthe only patriotic choice for president.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, the Philadelphia Enquirer and Houston Chronicle also endorsed Harris.\n\n\u201cAmerica deserves much more than an aspiring autocrat who ignores the law, is running to stay out of prison, and doesn\u2019t care about anyone but himself,\u201d the Inquirer editorial board wrote.",

        "text": "October 25, 2024, presidential campaign news\nVice President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump are holding dueling events in Texas as they seek to elevate competing issues central to their closing arguments with just 11 days to go until Election Day.\n\nTexas is not part of the universe of seven battleground states poised to decide the 2024 race for the White House. And polls show voters consistently rank the economy as their top concern in the election. Yet on Friday in the Lone Star State, the two candidates are shining a spotlight on separate issues that they see as key to energizing their voters in the closing days of the campaign.\n\nHarris: The vice president is leaning into the issue of reproductive rights as she blames her Republican rival for paving the way for a wave of new abortion restrictions across the country put in place after the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade a little more than two years ago. Texas, the second largest state in the US, has one of the country\u2019s strictest abortion laws. The procedure is banned after six weeks \u2014 before many women know they are pregnant \u2014 with exceptions only in cases to save the life of the mother. To coincide with the Texas stop, the Harris campaign released a new ad that features a clip of Trump taking credit for his role in ending the constitutional right to an abortion. Friday\u2019s rally in Houston will also feature music superstar and Houston native Beyonc\u00e9 as the Harris campaign continues to lean into celebrity endorsements and their appearances on the trail.\n\nTrump: The former president, meanwhile, is set to deliver remarks in Austin, where he plans to focus on immigration, an issue that has been a cornerstone of his political campaigns since the day he launched his first bid for the White House in 2015. Trump has vowed to expand on his hardline immigration policies during a second term, including a pledge to conduct mass deportations, while using dehumanizing rhetoric to refer to undocumented immigrants. During a campaign event Thursday in Arizona, Trump said the US has become \u201clike a garbage can for the world\u201d as a result of illegal border crossings.\n\nClosing message: While economy remains the most pressing priority for voters, polls show why Harris and Trump are leaning into these competing issues for their closing arguments. The latest survey from the New York Times and Siena College shows that the former president continues to hold an advantage on who is more trusted to handle immigration \u2014 54% to 43% \u2014 while Harris leads by the same 11-point margin when it comes to abortion.\n\nTexas Senate race in focus: With Harris and Trump in Texas, the state\u2019s US Senate race is also in the spotlight. Democratic candidate Colin Allred is set to appear at the vice president\u2019s event in Houston and GOP Sen. Ted Cruz is expected to join Trump in Austin. Those appearances come as a top Democratic super PAC plans to pour $5 million into the race in the final days as the party tries to prevent Republicans from flipping control of the chamber given the GOP\u2019s favorable map this cycle.",

While 35 states require voters to present some form of identification at the ballot box, 15 states still allow voting without a voter ID .As of April 2024, according to Ballotpedia , 35 US states mandate voter identification at the polls.Of these, 24 states require photo identification, while 11 states accept other forms of identification.However, the remaining 15 states do not require voters to show any form of ID to cast their ballot.US Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris has been a vocal opponent of voter ID laws. In a 2021 interview with Soledad O'Brien on BET, Harris expressed concerns that such laws could disproportionately affect rural communities, making it difficult for them to meet ID requirements.\"I don\u2019t think that we should underestimate what that could mean,\" Harris said. \"Because in some people\u2019s mind that means, well, you\u2019re going to have to Xerox or photocopy your ID to send it in to prove you are who you are. Well, there are a whole lot of people, especially people who live in rural communities, who don\u2019t \u2013 there\u2019s no Kinko\u2019s, there\u2019s no Office Max near them. People have to understand that when we\u2019re talking about voter ID laws, be clear about who you have in mind and what would be required of them to prove who they are.\"Tech billionaire Elon Musk , during a recent rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, for former President and Republican candidate Donald Trump , criticised the concept of voting without an ID and urged the public to register and participate in the election.",

        "text": "G20 vows to resist protectionism ahead of U.S. presidential election\nBy Takuya Karube, KYODO NEWS - Oct 25, 2024 - 09:14 | All, World\n\nFinance chiefs from the Group of 20 major economies pledged Thursday to resist protectionism, just days ahead of the U.S. presidential election, amid the stabilization of global growth despite increased geopolitical risks.\n\nFollowing a two-day meeting in Washington, the finance ministers and central bank governors of the leading developed and emerging economies said they see \"good prospects\" for a soft landing of the global economy, citing positive developments such as inflation declining from elevated levels in many parts of the world.\n\nHowever, they also warned of many challenges ahead, including wars, rising commodity prices and climate change. The group, which includes Russia, refrained from mentioning specific conflicts such as Moscow's ongoing invasion of Ukraine.\n\nBrazil, chair of this year's G20 discussions, released a separate statement saying some members expressed their views on Russia and Ukraine, as well as the situation in the Gaza Strip, noting \"these issues have an impact on the global economy.\"\n\n\"We commit to resist protectionism and encourage concerted efforts to support a rules-based, nondiscriminatory, fair, open, inclusive, equitable, sustainable, and transparent multilateral trading system,\" the finance chiefs said in a joint statement.\n\nThey added that the World Trade Organization should be at the system's core.\n\nTheir pledge came less than two weeks before the U.S. presidential election, with former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, promising to impose a 60 percent tariff on goods from China and an across-the-board levy of 10 to 20 percent on all imports from every country in the world.\n\nBank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda said at a press conference that a number of finance chiefs had expressed concern about the uncertainty of the election and economic policy under the next administration.\n\nMany mainstream economists have said the prospects for a trade war will increase if Trump is elected and implements his pledges.\n\nHis Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, has suggested that high tariffs on some Chinese goods imposed by the current administration on national security grounds will remain in place.\n\nWhile Harris has acknowledged that such duties are effectively a \"sales tax\" on U.S. consumers as they make domestic prices higher, both candidates favor such measures to protect companies and workers in the United States from foreign competition.\n\nBrazilian central bank chief Roberto Campos Neto, who co-chaired the latest talks, also touched on the U.S. election during a press conference at the close of the meeting, held on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank's annual autumn meetings.\n\nHe said three issues brought up by both candidates -- migration, fiscal expansion and protectionism -- could raise inflation in the world's largest economy.\n\nAlthough the finance ministers and central bankers agreed economic activity has proved to be more resilient than expected, they cautioned that \"growth has been highly uneven across countries.\"\n\n\"We are concerned that medium and long-term global growth prospects are below historical averages,\" their statement said.\n\nOn the yen's renewed weakness against the U.S. dollar and other currencies, Japanese Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato said at a press conference that he had told his counterparts it is necessary to pay attention to \"excessive fluctuations\" in the foreign exchange market.\n\nKato, who assumed his post earlier this month, held a bilateral meeting with U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and agreed to communicate closely with her on foreign exchange issues, according to Atsushi Mimura, Japan's top currency diplomat.\n\nUeda, who met the press with Kato, said he will carefully assess the impact of the yen's depreciation on prices and monetary policy, while keeping close tabs on external factors such as U.S. economic trends and the outcome of the presidential election.\n\nUeda also said there is \"plenty of time\" to make a decision on an additional interest rate hike in Japan.\n\nRelated coverage:\n\nIMF cuts Japan's 2024 growth estimate to 0.3%, lowest since pandemic\n\nG20 finance chiefs seek early signing of digital service tax treaty",

        "text": "Presidential election puts Affordable Care Act back in the bull's-eye\nThe outcome of the election could shape the coverage of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThis is a KFF Health News story.\n\nHealth care is suddenly front and center in the final sprint to the presidential election, and the outcome will shape the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and the coverage it gives to more than 40 million people.\n\nBesides reproductive rights, health care for most of the campaign has been an in-the-shadow issue. However, recent comments from former President Donald Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, about possible changes to the ACA have opened Republicans up to heavier scrutiny.\n\nMore than 1,500 doctors across the country recently released a letter calling on Trump to reveal details about how he would alter the ACA, saying the information is needed so voters can make an informed decision. The letter came from the Committee to Protect Health Care, a national advocacy group of physicians.\n\n\"It's remarkable that a decade and a half after the ACA passed, we are still debating these fundamental issues,\" said Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. \"Democrats want to protect people with preexisting conditions, which requires money and regulation. Republicans have looked to scale back federal regulation, and the byproduct is fewer protections.\"\n\nThe two parties' tickets hold starkly different goals for the ACA, a sweeping law passed under former President Barack Obama that set minimum benefit standards, made more people eligible for Medicaid and ensured consumers with preexisting health conditions couldn't be denied health coverage.\n\nFormer US President Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally in Duluth, Georgia, on Oct. 23, 2024. Christian Monterrosa/AFP via Getty Images\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, who previously backed a universal health care plan, wants to expand and strengthen the health law, popularly known as Obamacare. She supports making permanent temporary enhanced subsidies that lower the cost of premiums. And she's expected to press Congress to extend Medicaid coverage to more people in the 10 states that have so far not expanded the program.\n\nTrump, who repeatedly tried and failed to repeal the ACA, said in the September presidential debate that he has \"concepts of a plan\" to replace or change the legislation. Although that sound bite became a bit of a laugh line because Trump had promised an alternative health insurance plan many times during his administration and never delivered, Vance later provided more details.\n\nHe said the next Trump administration would deregulate insurance markets -- a change that some health analysts say could provide more choice but erode protections for people with preexisting conditions. He seemed to adjust his position during the vice presidential debate, saying the ACA's protections for preexisting conditions should be left in place.\n\nSuch health policy changes could be advanced as part of a large tax measure in 2025, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) told NBC News. That could also open the door to changes in Medicaid.\n\nConservatives have long sought to remake the health insurance program for low-income or disabled people from the current system, in which the federal government contributes a formula-based percentage of states' total Medicaid costs, to one that caps federal outlays through block grants or per capita funding limits. ACA advocates say that would shift significant costs to states and force most or all states to drop the expansion of the program over time.\n\nDemocrats are trying to turn the comments into a political liability for Trump, with the Harris campaign running ads saying Trump doesn't have a health plan to replace the ACA. Harris' campaign also released a 43-page report, \"The Trump-Vance 'Concept' on Health Care,\" asserting that her opponents would \"rip away coverage from people with preexisting conditions and raise costs for millions.\"\n\nRepublicans were tripped up in the past when they sought unsuccessfully to repeal the ACA. Instead, the law became more popular, and the risk Republicans posed to preexisting condition protections helped Democrats retake control of the House in 2018.\n\nIn a KFF poll last winter, two-thirds of the public said it is very important to maintain the law's ban on charging people with health problems more for health insurance or rejecting their coverage.\n\n\"People in this election are focused on issues that affect their family,\" said Robert Blendon, a professor emeritus of health policy and political analysis at Harvard. \"If people believe their own insurance will be affected by Trump, it could matter.\"\n\nVance, in a Sept. 15 interview on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" tried to minimize this impact.\n\n\"You want to make sure that preexisting coverage -- conditions -- are covered, you want to make sure that people have access to the doctors that they need and you also want to implement some deregulatory agenda so that people can choose a health care plan that fits them,\" he said.\n\nDemocratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris speaks during a CNN town hall in Aston, Penn. on Oct. 23, 2024. Matt Rourke/AP\n\nVance went on to say that the best way to ensure everyone is covered is to promote more choice and not put everyone in the same insurance risk pool.\n\nRisk pools are fundamental to insurance. They refer to a group of people who share the burdens of health costs.\n\nUnder the ACA, enrollees are generally in the same pool regardless of their health status or preexisting conditions. This is done to control premium costs for everyone by using the lower costs incurred by healthy participants to keep in check the higher costs incurred by unhealthy participants. Separating sicker people into their own pool can lead to higher costs for people with chronic health conditions, potentially putting coverage out of financial reach for them.\n\nThe Harris campaign has seized on the threat, saying in its recent report that \"health insurers will go back to discriminating on the basis of how healthy or unhealthy you are.\"\n\nHowever some ACA critics think there are ways to separate risk pools without undermining coverage.\n\n\"Unsurprisingly, it's been blown out of proportion for political purposes,\" said Theo Merkel, a former Trump aide who now is a senior research fellow at the Paragon Health Institute, a right-leaning organization that produces health research and market-based policy proposals.\n\nAdding short-term plans to coverage options won't hurt the ACA marketplace and will give consumers more affordable options, said Merkel, who is also a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute. The Trump administration increased the maximum duration of these plans, then Biden rolled it back to four months.\n\nPeople eligible for subsidies would likely buy comprehensive ACA plans because -- with the financial help -- they would be affordable. Thus, the ACA market and its protections for preexisting conditions would continue to function, Merkel said. But offering short-term plans, too, would provide a more affordable option for people who don't qualify for subsidies and who would be more likely to buy the non-compliant plans.\n\nHe also said that in states that allowed people to buy non-ACA-compliant plans outside the exchange, the exchanges performed better than in states that prohibited it. Another option, Merkel said, is a reinsurance program similar to one that operates in Alaska. Under the plan, the state pays insurers back for covering very expensive health claims, which helps keep premiums affordable.\n\nSen. JD Vance speaks at a campaign rally in Peoria, Ariz. on Oct. 22, 2024. Ross D. Franklin/AP\n\nBut advocates of the ACA say separating sick and healthy people into different insurance risk pools will make health coverage unaffordable for people with chronic conditions, and that letting people purchase short-term health plans for longer durations will backfire.\n\n\"It uninsures people when they get sick,\" said Leslie Dach, executive chair of Protect Our Care, which advocates for the health law. \"There's no reason to do this. It's unconscionable and makes no economic sense. They will hide behind saying 'we're making it better,' but it's all untrue.\"\n\nHarris, meanwhile, wants to preserve the temporarily expanded subsidies that have helped more people get lower-priced health coverage under the ACA. These expanded subsidies that help about 20 million people will expire at the end of 2025, setting the stage for a pitched battle in Congress between Republicans who want to let them run out and Democrats who say they should be made permanent.\n\nDemocrats in September introduced a bill to make them permanent. One challenge: The Congressional Budget Office estimated doing so would increase the federal deficit by more than $330 billion over 10 years.\n\nIn the end, the ability of either candidate to significantly grow or change the ACA rests with Congress. Polls suggest Republicans are in a good position to take control of the Senate, with the outcome in the House more up in the air. The margins, however, will likely be tight. In any case, many initiatives, such as expanding or restricting short-term health plans, also can be advanced with executive orders and regulations, as both Trump and Biden have done.",

In appearances on opposite sides of the staunchly Republican state, the nominees set out their contrasting visions for the country \u2013 with the content of their pitches underlining recent polling data which shows the gender gap among voters widening to historic levels.\n\nIn Houston, Harris was joined by Beyonc\u00e9, with the Democratic candidate telling the Texas crowd that they were \u201cground zero in the fight for reproductive freedom\u201d. She went on to call out Texas for having one of the most restrictive bans in the country, adding \u201cnow one in three women lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, an interview with podcaster Joe Rogan in Austin created another opportunity for Trump to highlight the hyper-masculine tone that has defined much of his 2024 White House bid. A Trump victory could hinge on men turning out to vote for the Republican nominee, according to Politico, which highlighted Rogan\u2019s podcast as a good place to reach them. With an audience in the tens of millions, The Joe Rogan Experience has built a massive, mostly male, audience.\n\nHere\u2019s what else happened on Friday:\n\nKamala Harris election news\n\nAt the conclusion of her Houston rally, Harris called on voters to cast their ballots early. \u201cDo we trust women? Do we believe in reproductive freedom? Do we believe in the promise of America, and are we ready to fight for it?\u201d Harris said, before concluding by saying, \u201cWhen we fight, we win.\u201d\n\nIn Houston, Beyonc\u00e9 was joined by her former Destiny\u2019s Child bandmate, Kelly Rowland, in front of an audience of 30,000 people. \u201cI\u2019m not here as a celebrity. I\u2019m not here as a politician. I\u2019m here as a mother,\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 said. \u201cImagine our daughters growing up seeing what\u2019s possible with no ceilings, no limitations.\u201d\n\nWhile Beyonc\u00e9 appealed to a younger crowd, 91-year-old Willie Nelson showed earlier in the event that he still has cachet in his native Texas . \u201cAre we ready to say Madam President?\u201d Nelson asked the crowd before launching into Mammas Don\u2019t Let Your Babies Grow Up To Be Cowboys, to which the audience sang along.\n\nColin Allred, the Democratic congressman running to unseat Texas senator Ted Cruz, used the rally to denounce his opponent. \u201cI believe in a very different Texas than Ted Cruz does,\u201d Allred said. \u201cMy time in Congress, I\u2019ve been the exact opposite of Ted Cruz, because I never forgot where I came from, never forgot the folks who gave me a chance. He went on to lead the crowd in a chant of \u201cYou gotta lose your job.\u201d\n\nTim Walz delivered a rousing pep talk in Scranton, Pennsylvania, telling voters the race was \u201cgoing to be tight\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s the fourth quarter. We have got the best team on the field,\u201d Walz said. \u201cWe have got to do this one inch at a time, one yard at a time, one door at a time, one call at a time, one dollar at a time, one vote at a time.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump election news\n\nDonald Trump ran hours late to a rally in Michigan, causing thousands of his supporters to leave while others huddled in cold weather to await the former president at an outdoor rally in the battleground state. The Republican presidential nominee was delayed by his interview with Rogan, which stretched to three hours. In Michigan, Trump said \u201cwe\u2019ve got a war going and she\u2019s out partying,\u201d a reference to Israel\u2019s attacks on Iran.\n\nChinese government-linked hackers are believed to have targeted phones used by Donald Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, as part of a larger breach of US telecommunications networks, according to a New York Times report. Investigators are working to determine what data, if any, was accessed by the \u201csophisticated\u201d hack, sources said.\n\nElsewhere on the campaign trail\n\nThere was uproar and outrage among the Washington Post\u2019s current and former staff and other notable figures in the world of American media after the newspaper\u2019s leaders on Friday chose to not endorse any candidate in the US presidential election. The newspaper\u2019s publisher, Will Lewis, announced on Friday that for the first time in over 30 years, the paper\u2019s editorial board would not be endorsing a candidate in this year\u2019s presidential election, nor in future presidential elections. The decision, according to some staffers and reporters, was allegedly made by the Post\u2019s owner, billionaire Jeff Bezos.\n\nRussian actors were behind a widely circulated video falsely depicting mail-in ballots for Donald Trump being destroyed in Pennsylvania , US officials confirmed. The video had taken off on social media but was debunked within three hours by local election officials and law enforcement after members of the public reported it.\n\nAdam Smith, the ranking Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, has called for the defence department to investigate a report that Elon Musk has been in regular contact with Russian President Vladimir Putin , Politico reports. Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and Armed Services Committee, said \u201cElon Musk, who has billions in contracts that support some of our most sensitive military operations, reportedly has an open line to Putin.\u201d Musk\u2019s spacecraft company SpaceX has multiple contracts with the defence department and Nasa. According to a Wall Street Journal report, the billionaire has had previously unreported discussions with Putin since 2022.\n\nA fresh group of \u201clifelong Republican\u201d former aides to Donald Trump added their voices to the chorus of criticism of the Republican nominee, speaking out in support of John Kelly, who earlier this week called his old boss a fascist. \u201cThe revelations General Kelly brought forward are disturbing and shocking. But because we know Trump and have worked for and alongside him, we were sadly not surprised by what General Kelly had to say,\u201d a letter from more than a dozen staffers who worked in Trump\u2019s administration says.\n\nRead more about the 2024 US election:",

        "text": "US election: 10 days left \u2013 What polls say, what Harris and Trump are up to\nHarris to campaign with Michelle Obama in Michigan while Trump will have stops in Michigan and Pennsylvania.\n\nWith 10 days left to go until Election Day, the race to the White House between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump remains very tight across the nation\u2019s battleground states.\n\nCandidates Harris, Trump and their surrogates hit the campaign trail in full force.\n\nSinger Beyonce Knowles, her former Destiny\u2019s Child bandmate Kelly Rowland and country singer Willie Nelson all tried to use their star power to turn out voters for Harris in Texas.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, sat down with podcaster Joe Rogan for a three-hour interview. He then travelled to Michigan, where he belatedly addressed a thinned crowd due to the delay.\n\nThe latest national poll conducted by the New York Times and Siena College from October 20 to 23, 2024 showed that Harris and Trump are tied nationally at 48 percent. The remaining 4 percent are undecided.\n\nAmong likely female voters, Harris holds an advantage of 54 percent to 42 percent against Trump. But the former president is making up for that among male voters with 55 percent against 41 percent supporting Harris.\n\nHarris received the highest support from voters aged between 18 to 29 with 55 percent against Trump\u2019s 43 percent, while Trump is ahead 51 percent to 44 percent among voters aged 45 to 64.\n\nWorryingly for Harris, 61 percent of respondents said the country was headed down the wrong track while 27 percent said it was on the right track.\n\nMeanwhile, the FiveThirtyEight poll tracker, which calculates the average of several national polls, shows Harris holding on to a razor-thin lead of 48 percent to Trump\u2019s 46.6 percent. But her 1.4 percent point lead is lower than the 1.8 percent earlier this week.\n\nWhile national surveys provide valuable insights into voter sentiment, the ultimate winner will be decided by the Electoral College, which reflects the outcomes in individual states.\n\nThe seven key swing states that could determine the election are Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Together, these states account for 93 \u2013 or a third \u2013 of the 270 Electoral College required to win the election.\n\nAccording to FiveThirtyEight\u2019s latest poll average, Trump has a 1 percent advantage in North Carolina and 2 percent edge in Arizona and Georgia. And there\u2019s less than half a percentage point separating Harris and Trump in Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, with Trump marginally ahead in Pennsylvania and Nevada, and Harris with a razor-thin edge in Michigan and Wisconsin.\n\nAll results are within margin of error and the outcome of the voting could swing either way.\n\nWhat was Kamala Harris up to on Friday?\n\nHarris campaigned with musicians Beyonce Knowles, Kelly Rowland and Willie Nelson in Houston, Texas.\n\nDuring the stop, Harris highlighted her support for abortion rights as she sought to strike a contrast with Trump and make gains with female voters.\n\nTexas has not backed a Democratic president since 1976, and Republican Trump is almost certain to win the state\u2019s 40 Electoral College votes.\n\nBut Democrats are betting it will provide a powerful backdrop for Harris to talk about abortion rights in the final days before the November 5 election. The state, under Republican Governor Greg Abbott, has adopted some of the nation\u2019s toughest anti-abortion regulations.\n\nWhat was Donald Trump up to on Friday?\n\nTrump was also campaigning in Texas on Friday, making a stop in Austin to record an episode of \u201cThe Joe Rogan Experience,\u201d. Rogan is arguably the most popular podcaster in the United States, with tens of millions of social media followers, most of them men. Rogan\u2019s podcast has 17.5 million subscribers on YouTube alone, and 14 million on Spotify. The average age of his listeners is 24, according to Media Monitors.\n\nIn his interview with Rogan, Trump again suggested he favoured eliminating income tax and replacing the lost revenue with tariffs.\n\nTrump then travelled to a rally at Traverse City, Michigan, where he turned to Harris\u2019s struggles with the state\u2019s large Arab American population, which could determine the outcome of a very close race.\n\nTrump leads Harris 45 percent to 43 percent among Arab Americans with two weeks to go until voters choose the next US president, according to the Arab News/YouGov poll released on Monday, with large sections of the community angry with the Biden administration that Harris is a part of, for its unflinching support for Israel\u2019s war on Gaza and Lebanon.\n\n\u201cKamala is also in total free fall with the Arab and Muslim population in Michigan. She\u2019s in a free fall,\u201d Trump said. \u201cShe sent their jobs overseas, brought crime to their cities, and tonight in the Middle East, it\u2019s like a tinderbox that\u2019s ready to explode. People are being killed at levels we\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d\n\nHe also referred to Harris\u2019s unlikely alliance with former Republican Congresswoman Liz Cheney, who is campaigning for the vice president. Cheney, who has had a long-running feud with Trump, is the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, a central figure in the Iraq invasion of 2003. \u201cAnd why would Muslims support Kamala when she embraces Muslim-hating Liz Cheney?\u201d Trump asked, speaking to the crowd.\n\nWhat\u2019s next for the Harris and Trump campaigns?\n\nHarris will be campaigning in the city of Kalamazoo in Michigan on Saturday with former First Lady Michelle Obama.\n\nThe get-out-the-vote rally will be Michelle Obama\u2019s first event on the campaign trail for Harris.\n\nSaturday is the first day of early voting statewide in Michigan.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump is scheduled to hold several events in Pennsylvania on Saturday but will start his day with a rally in Michigan.\n\nTrump\u2019s running mate JD Vance will make a campaign stop in Atlanta, Georgia, before heading to Erie and Harrisburg in Pennsylvania.",

We will not be conquered.\u201d\n\nIn another speech in Wisconsin, Trump said undocumented immigrants would enter your home and \u201ccut your throat\u201d.\n\nBut as the presidential race heats up between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, some experts have noted that parties, both liberal and conservative, are shifting rightward on immigration \u2014 reflecting a global trend.\n\nAs Trump leans into nativist attacks on immigrants, Harris has responded with her own pledges for more restrictions, even at the expense of internationally recognised asylum rights.\n\n\u201cAs vice president, she backed the toughest border control bill in decades, and as president, she will hire thousands more border agents,\u201d one of her campaign ads says.\n\nExperts and rights groups say that the tough talk on immigration is an indication of the growing mainstream influence of the far right, both in the US and abroad.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this spectre of being overrun by \u2018the other\u2019 that has always been there,\u201d Petra Molnar, a lawyer and anthropologist specialising in migration and human rights, told Al Jazeera.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s no longer being expressed just by the far-right. It seems to have filtered into the entire conversation around immigration.\u201d",

        "text": "A look at the state of affordable housing in the U.S.\nA home under construction in Rancho Mission Viejo in Orange County, California, in September 2024. (Paul Bersebach/MediaNews Group/Orange County Register via Getty Images)\n\nHousing affordability has emerged as a key issue in this year\u2019s U.S. presidential election. Both Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump have talked about what they would do to increase the supply of affordable homes and people\u2019s ability to buy them, though their plans have little in common.\n\nIt\u2019s an important issue for the public, too: In a recent Pew Research Center survey, 69% of Americans said they were \u201cvery concerned\u201d about the cost of housing, up from 61% in April 2023.\n\nBut what counts as an \u201caffordable\u201d home, and how many Americans are struggling to afford a place to live? This analysis tries to answer those questions, using data from U.S. Census Bureau surveys and other sources.\n\nHow we did this Pew Research Center conducted this analysis to explore housing affordability in the United States. Our major source was the U.S. Census Bureau, in particular its American Community Survey, Current Population Survey/Housing Vacancy Survey and Survey of Construction. Some of the data in those surveys refers to both metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) and micropolitan statistical areas (micros). The Office of Management and Budget defines MSAs as having \u201cat least one urban area of 50,000 or more population, plus adjacent territory that has a high degree of social and economic integration with the core as measured by commuting ties.\u201d Micros are defined similarly, except that they have at least one urban area with a population of between 10,000 and 50,000. The data on households that spend 30% or more of their income on housing is based on the American Community Survey\u2019s 1-year estimates. These estimates include all 393 metropolitan areas plus 137 micropolitan areas with total populations of 65,000 or more. The share of households in each state, metropolitan area or micropolitan area is calculated only among households for which data on housing costs as a share of household income was available. Cost burden was not calculated for about 3.9 million households, or 2.9% of all U.S. households, primarily because they either have no income or pay no rent. The data covers both rented and owned units (and the latter both with and without mortgages). We also used data from a 2024 Center survey, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), Freddie Mac, Realtor.com and Zillow. Links to these sources, including methodological information for the Center survey, are available in the text. Realtor.com\u2019s data on listing volumes is based on aggregated data from hundreds of local multiple listing services. Zillow\u2019s data on median sales prices is based on all recorded home sales in a given area. Housing price index data from FHFA and Consumer Price Index data from the Census Bureau is not seasonally adjusted.\n\nWhat makes a home affordable?\n\nOne commonly used (though also criticized) benchmark for housing affordability is that no more than 30% of household income should go toward housing costs. Households that spend more than that are considered \u201ccost burdened\u201d by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nHow the U.S. Census Bureau defines \u2018housing costs\u2019 and \u2018gross rent\u2019 The bureau\u2019s American Community Survey defines \u201chousing costs\u201d as including rent or mortgage payments, property taxes, utilities, homeowners insurance, condominium or mobile-home fees and the like. \u201cGross rent\u201d includes the contract rent on the property as well as utilities and fuels, if paid by the tenant.\n\nBy that standard, 31.3% of American households were cost burdened in 2023, including 27.1% of households with a mortgage and 49.7% of households that rent, according to 1-year estimates from the Census Bureau\u2019s American Community Survey (ACS). (Many more people own than rent: In the second quarter of 2024, 65.6% of occupied housing units were owned while 34.4% were rented, according to the most recent estimates from the Census Bureau\u2019s Current Population Survey/Housing Vacancy Survey.)\n\nWe can also look at affordability for renters, specifically, over time using a slightly different standard: the share who spent 30% or more of their income on gross rent, rather than the share who spent more than 30% on total housing costs. In 2023, about half (51.8%) of renting households paid that much in gross rent, ACS estimates show. By comparison, 53.4% of renting households paid that much in 2011. The share of renters reaching that threshold hovered around 50% for the entire 2011-2023 period.\n\nHow has the housing market changed in recent years?\n\nThe U.S. housing market, as measured by the number of active for-sale properties on local multiple listing services (MLS), shrank dramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic but has since partially rebounded.\n\nOn any given day in September 2019, according to Realtor.com, there were more than 1.2 million active MLS listings. By September 2023, that number had fallen 42.7%, to about 702,000. But as of September 2024, there were about 941,000 active listings on a given day, 34.0% more than a year earlier. (These totals exclude pending listings when that data is available.)\n\nSimilar patterns are found across the country. In September 2024, 78.9% of the 900-plus local markets Realtor.com tracks had fewer active listings than they did in September 2019, but 92.2% had more active listings than in September 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, home prices continue to rise. The Federal Housing Finance Agency\u2019s national House Price Index, a gauge of how selling prices for single-family homes have changed over time, was 57.8% higher in July than it was in July 2019. For comparison, the Consumer Price Index \u2013 which measures price changes for a broad range of consumer goods and services \u2013 rose 22.8% overall between September 2019 and September 2024.\n\nRelated: Prices are up in all U.S. metro areas, but some much more than others\n\nHow does housing affordability vary geographically?\n\nLike much else involving real estate, \u201clocation, location, location\u201d plays a key role in how housing cost burdens are distributed. That\u2019s especially true in California, according to our analysis of 2023 ACS estimates.\n\nThe federal government identifies more than 900 metropolitan and \u201cmicropolitan\u201d areas in the United States and Puerto Rico, based on the population of an area\u2019s core city or town. Many of the metropolitan and micropolitan areas with the highest shares of cost-burdened households (i.e., those that spend more than 30% of their income on housing costs) are in California.\n\nSmaller micro- and metropolitan areas, as well as largely rural states, generally tend to have lower shares of cost-burdened households. Looking at the metro- and micropolitan areas where the smallest shares of households spend more than 30% on housing, most have populations smaller than 250,000, and the majority are located in Wisconsin, Alabama or North Carolina.\n\nSome states have especially high shares of households spending more than 30% of their income on housing. For example, 40.6% of California households meet this threshold \u2013 including more than half (54.1%) of renters. Roughly similar shares of households in Hawaii (38.2%) and Florida (37.2%) also spend this much on housing costs, according to the 2023 ACS estimates.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, much smaller shares of households meet the \u201ccost burdened\u201d threshold in West Virginia (21.0% of households), North Dakota (22.0%), South Dakota and Iowa (23.6% each).\n\nIn every state, a greater share of renting households than homeowning ones are cost burdened when it comes to their housing costs. And homeowning households that carry a mortgage are more likely to be cost burdened than those that don\u2019t.\n\nAt the same time, the Federal Housing Finance Agency\u2019s state-level house price indices have increased for every U.S. state and the District of Columbia, by anywhere from 22.6% (D.C.) to 82.3% (Maine) between the second quarters of 2019 and 2024. Among the nation\u2019s 100 largest metro areas, Miami-Miami Beach-Kendall in Florida had the biggest five-year increase in its house price index between the second quarters of 2019 and 2024: 95.0%.\n\nIn terms of actual dollars, Edwards, Colorado (near the Vail and Beaver Creek ski areas) tops Zillow\u2019s list of 716 local markets: The median selling price there in August 2024 was $1.56 million. But of the 604 localities for which Zillow has five years of price data, another Centennial State ski town was top of the mountain: Between August 2019 and August 2024, the median selling price in Steamboat Springs rose 155.5%, from $433,500 to $1,107,500.\n\nWhat factors contribute to housing being unaffordable?\n\nA lack of housing affordability is the product of multiple factors intersecting in sometimes unpredictable ways. Interest rates, new home construction, population growth, population shifts, rising home prices and rents, disposable incomes, and local economic conditions all affect how easy or difficult it can be to find a home you can afford in a place you want to live. Let\u2019s take a closer look at a few of these factors.\n\nInterest rates\n\nAlmost four-in-ten households (39.3%), or 51.6 million, carry mortgages on their homes, according to 2023 ACS estimates. Soon after the COVID-19 pandemic began, the average interest rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage fell dramatically \u2013 from 3.72% at the start of 2020 to as low as 2.65% by the start of 2021, according to data from Freddie Mac. That prompted millions of homeowners to refinance their mortgages, locking in low rates and lowering their monthly payments. (A similar refinancing wave followed the collapse of the 2000s housing bubble.)\n\nSince then, the average 30-year rate has soared as high as 7.79% (in late October 2023) and fallen to, as of late October 2024, 6.54% \u2013 roughly tracking investor expectations on inflation and the path of Federal Reserve interest-rate policy.\n\nStill, according to a recent analysis by Federal Housing Finance Agency economists, most homeowners with fixed-rate mortgages are sitting on interest rates well below what they\u2019d get if they took out a new mortgage today \u2013 limiting their ability, or willingness, to put their existing homes on the market. In that working paper, the economists estimate that this \u201clock-in\u201d effect led to 1.33 million fewer home sales between the second quarter of 2022 and the end of 2023.\n\nNew home construction\n\nAnother way to increase the inventory of homes for sale is to build more of them. But the homebuilding industry took a deep dive during the Great Recession \u2013 falling from 2.07 million privately owned housing unit \u201cstarts\u201d in 2005 to 554,000 in 2009 \u2013 and still has a way to go before returning to pre-crisis levels. In September 2024, housing starts were running at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.35 million, according to the Census Bureau\u2019s Survey of Construction.\n\nThe decline has been especially pronounced in entry-level single-family homes, defined as those smaller than 1,400 square feet. The peak year this century for new homes of that size was 2004, when 186,000 were built (12.1% of all single-family homes built that year). In 2023, however, only 87,000 new single-family homes (8.7%) were under 1,400 square feet, according to the Census Bureau.\n\nMeanwhile, 23.5% of new single-family homes in 2023 were 3,000 square feet or larger, compared with 20.3% in 2004.\n\nMultifamily housing, such as apartment and condo buildings, may offer some relief. Coming out of the Great Recession, buildings with five or more units were completed at a steadily rising pace until rising significantly in 2023, according to the Census Bureau\u2019s Survey of Construction. That year, 438,300 such privately owned housing buildings were completed, more than in any year since 1987. And as of September 2024, completions of buildings with five or more units were running at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 671,000.",

        "text": "Neck and neck: On the U.S. presidential election\nWith less than two weeks before voting day in the 2024 U.S. election, no clear winner has emerged in the contest between Democrat and incumbent Vice-President Kamala Harris, and Republican and former President Donald Trump, two candidates who could not be more mutually differentiated in terms of values profiles and public personas. Averages of national polls suggest that Ms. Harris has a slender lead of around 1.7%, with close to 48.1% of the results favouring her relative to Mr. Trump\u2019s 46.4%. Similarly, in seven key swing States which could end up having a decisive impact on the outcome of voting in the electoral college, Mr. Trump appears to be enjoying a small lead in Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina, even though that lead has switched back and forth between the two candidates. In Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, Ms. Harris has nosed slightly ahead of Mr. Trump although now the advantage has slipped back to Mr. Trump in Pennsylvania, even if it is less than 1%. In Nevada it appears to be a dead heat, though in each of these swing States the lead is less than 3% \u2014 quite likely to lie well within the statistical margin of error. Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin were in the past Blue States, but Mr. Trump flipped them to Republicans in 2016. Incumbent President Joe Biden brought them back to the Democratic camp in 2020, a win that Ms. Harris would need to reprise if she is to emerge the victor.\n\nThe candidate that independent and undecided voters pick will determine whether the U.S. continues with a socially and economically progressive agenda under Ms. Harris, or whether a more conservative approach that is aligned to the personality and whims of Mr. Trump and his ad hoc approach to domestic and foreign policy, wins the day. As president, Ms. Harris would oversee a broader role for government in regulating the economy, including by introducing tax cuts for the middle class and continuing the Biden plan for trade tariffs to boost U.S. global competitiveness. She would also champion the effort to protect abortion rights through Congress, advocate for humane policing of the southern border alongside immigration reform and ensure that Washington remains engaged with foreign allies to manage global conflicts. Mr. Trump\u2019s leadership paradigm would see, if he is back, the government hand out corporate tax rate cuts and exempt social security benefits from income tax. He would adopt a hawkish stand on immigration, including by accelerating deportations to possibly unprecedented levels. Global alliances may take a back seat, if it comes to pass. Whichever candidate prevails, on November 5, voters have a unique opportunity to shape the destiny of their country, at least for the next four years.",

        "summary": " In 2021, Virginia became the first Southern state to abolish the death penalty . Virginia has the highest death toll in the U.S. with over 1,300 executions, surpassed only by Texas and Oklahoma . Of the 50 states, 27 still retain capital punishment .",
        "text": "U.S. Presidential Election 2024: Death penalty absent from campaign, but not from minds\nA few blocks from downtown Richmond, Virginia, the intersection of Spring Street and Belvidere Street now presents a completely different view. Where once stood a grim, old brick building, there is now a modern building with a glass facade reflecting the sun shining on Virginia\u2019s capital. Trees along the wide Belvidere Street give the neighborhood a promenade-like feel, with the James River flowing nearby along the memorial for American war dead.\n\nThe lasting memory of October 1984\n\nWhen he first came here in 1984, Michael Stone wasn\u2019t out for a walk; he was on a mission. It was 40 years ago, almost to the day, but the memories are vivid, and he never fully recovered. Michael had just joined the Diocese of Richmond as a social worker. His superiors encouraged him to attend his first vigil, a solemn gathering outside the old brick building. Across the street, another group was gathered, but they were celebrating. \u201cIt\u2019s a horrible memory,\u201d said Michael, still moved four decades later. \u201cIt marked me forever. And although I hadn\u2019t been particularly concerned about the death penalty, it became my priority.\u201d\n\nThe now-demolished building was a penitentiary with a dark history, long marked by the horrors of segregation. It housed Virginia\u2019s death row and its electric chair. That October night in 1984, the condemned man was Linwood Briley, an African-American involved in multiple crimes with his brothers. \u201cThis was Virginia's second execution since the reinstatement of the death penalty in the U.S. in 1976,\u201d Stone recalled. Virginia has the highest death toll in the country, with over 1,300 executions, including over a hundred since 1976, surpassed only by Texas and Oklahoma in recent decades.\n\nVirginia\u2019s abolition in 2021\n\nHowever, the machine ultimately halted in 2021, when Virginia became the first Southern state to abolish the death penalty. Virginians for Alternatives to the Death Penalty, led by Stone, spearheaded this effort. On March 24, 2021, then-Governor Ralph Northam, a Democrat, ended a practice that dated back centuries. The first execution in what would become the United States took place in Virginia in 1608, with a man accused of espionage for Spain, a rival colonial power. Now, capital punishment has been replaced by life imprisonment without parole\u2014another harsh and hopeless sentence. Still, an important step was taken as the electric chair was disconnected.\n\nOf the 50 states, 27 still retain the death penalty. About 20 people are executed annually in the United States, a steady decline since the late 20th century, which saw around a hundred executions per year, dropping to fifty by 2010. There was once hope that this trend would lead to complete abolition. In practice, however, only a handful of states still carry out executions, with some, like California in 2019, declaring moratoriums due to ethical concerns.\n\n\u201cThis was the national abolition coalition\u2019s strategy until recently,\u201d explained Rob Poggenklass, director of Justice Forward Virginia, an NGO advocating for judicial reform in Virginia. \u201cThe goal was to push the U.S. Supreme Court to examine the issue, given the glaring injustice for those on death row in only a few states. The Constitution requires equal treatment for all citizens. However, with the current Supreme Court, shaped by former U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s appointees, that\u2019s a dead end. This court will never address it. That path is blocked and for a long time.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump: Proponent of the death penalty\n\nThe Republican candidate is an unreserved advocate of capital punishment in the name of \u201claw and order.\u201d However, the president has limited authority in this area, as justice is primarily a state matter in the U.S. Of the 2,213 inmates on death row, only about 40 are under federal jurisdiction (in cases involving terrorism, military tribunals, etc.). Still, during his previous term, Trump lifted a 17-year moratorium and sped up executions, with 13 carried out in his last six months as president.\n\nThis year, in a campaign dominated by economic and immigration issues, the death penalty is not a national issue. But at rallies, Trump regularly repeats his desire to send drug traffickers and convicted immigrant murderers to the electric chair, drawing enthusiastic applause from his supporters.\n\nJasna, a lifelong Republican and daughter of Croatian immigrants, is volunteering at a conservative voter information center in Franconia, northern Virginia. Despite being Catholic, she is not disturbed by Trump\u2019s statements. \u201cOf course, life is sacred,\u201d she said. \u201cBut there are cases where something has to be done. It\u2019s the worst of the worst\u2014pedophiles, terrorists\u2026\u201d Around her, other volunteers, also Catholic, nod in agreement.\n\nKamala Harris: A staunch abolitionist but silent in 2024\n\nKamala Harris is a committed abolitionist. In her time as a California prosecutor, she openly opposed the death penalty, even when it was unpopular. Running for San Francisco District Attorney in 2003, she pledged not to pursue capital punishment and upheld this stance, even after a San Francisco police officer\u2019s murder provoked outrage. Despite criticism from her own party, she held firm, maintaining her position when she ran for California Attorney General in 2010.\n\nHowever, the vice president has avoided discussing the issue in her current presidential campaign. This year, unlike in 2016 and 2020, the Democratic Party\u2019s platform, adopted at the summer convention, does not mention abolition. \u201cIt would be political suicide,\u201d Stone conceded, noting rising crime post-COVID, even though rates have recently shown a downward trend.\n\nMajority support for the death penalty but declining\n\n\u201cThere is indeed a drop in public support for the death penalty, but it\u2019s not enough,\u201d Poggenklas said. While just over half of Americans support capital punishment (down from 67% in 2000, according to Gallup), nearly two-thirds would favor replacing it with life without parole, as Virginia has done. \u201cPolitical change is what\u2019s needed.\u201d\n\nThe Pope Video for September is for abolition of the death penalty Further reading:\n\nThe 2019 Virginia elections, which gave Democrats majorities in both state chambers, paved the way for abolition. An unplanned factor also helped: an old photo of Governor Northam in blackface from his student years resurfaced in 2019. In response to the outcry, he committed to fighting discrimination, starting with the abolition of the death penalty, which disproportionately affected Black Americans.\n\nThough the death penalty is not a central campaign issue, the November 5 election could impact it. Trump and Harris would pursue opposite policies within their limited presidential influence. President Joe Biden also has a role to play. \u201cEspecially if Donald Trump wins,\u201d noted Stone. Biden could, before leaving office, commute the sentences of federal death row inmates. \u201cI\u2019m sure the Bishop of Delaware, Biden\u2019s home state, or the Archbishop of Washington will quietly advocate for this cause. Discreetly, which is the most effective way.\u201d",

Who is the other shortest president?\n\nThat\u2019s the favorite presidential trivia question of Stephen Engel, professor of politics and associate dean of faculty. If you really want to know the answer, he\u2019ll tell you it\u2019s James Madison, at 5 feet, 4 inches. But as co-host of Election Trivia Night in the Den, he also makes you promise not to take any points for that question.\n\nA cheer goes up as teams offer a correct answer \u2014 favorite Bates son Edmund Muskie \u201936 \u2014 to a the question, \u201cWhich Bates graduate was a nominee for vice president of the U.S.?\u201d Part of the college\u2019s Election 2024 programming, Election Trivia Night at the Den on Oct. 9 offered students a chance for political engagement, community building, and some fun.

The event debuted during the 2016 presidential race, and after skipping 2020 due to the pandemic, the duo brought it back for the first post-pandemic election cycle.\n\n\u201cIn 2016 we just needed to have some fun, wanted some levity,\u201d says Kelley-Romano, a professor of rhetoric, film, and screen studies. \u201cAnd it\u2019s fun to think of all the weird things that we end up putting in the trivia questions.\u201d\n\nPre-event, Election Trivia Night already feels fun, with Kelley-Romano wearing bobcat pajama pants and receiving chicken bites from a student worker at the Den, while students pour into the room, separating into teams of three or four. They head to Engel, who is busy opening boxes of mini whiteboard erasers, to tell him their team names.\n\nSeniors Eliza Dewey (left) and Katherine Moe, both of Washington, D.C., confer about an answer for their team, The Situation, during Election Trivia Night in the Den on Oct. 9, 2024.

The two-person team called \u201cThe Republicans\u201d laugh with surprise when they are able to name the most Republican candidates from the 2024 primaries (nine!).\n\nSophomores Nikhil Chavda of Nottingham, N.H., and Campbell Macdonald of Carlisle, Mass., offer their answer to the question \u201cWhich independent candidate decided to put an already dead bear cub in the trunk of his car, and then left it in Central Park in NYC?\u201d Their team, The Republicans, tied for first with 49 points.

Claire Bennett, one of two candidates running mock presidential campaigns this fall as part of Kelley-Romano\u2019s course \u201cPresidential Campaign Rhetoric.\u201d\n\nWorking the room as candidate Bennett, Belber takes a photo for her campaign\u2019s social media feed. Shifting back to her student identity for the trivia competition, her team, named \u201cKingdom of Hawaii\u201d as a nod to teammate Hugh Piper \u201925 of Honolulu, Hawaii, finishes third.\n\nKingdom of Hawaii teammates Philip Han \u201925 (left) of Seoul, South Korea, and Leah Belber \u201926 of Washington, D.C., ponder an answer during Election Trivia Night at the Den on Oct. 9. (Carly Philpott \u201927 for Bates College)\n\nIt\u2019s clear that many of the students at the event are there because of Kelley-Romano, whether they are part of her presidential campaign rhetoric course, which has 17 students, or they know her outside of class.\n\nThey approach her, waving and laughing as they arrive, and she circles the tables while they answer, commenting on their responses without giving anything away. Engel balances her energy by standing at the front of the room, reading the questions. When asked who is better at trivia, each points to the other and they both laugh.\n\nLast summer, Engel and Kelley-Romano were part of a working group that developed a wide-ranging slate of pre-election programming, which includes debate watch parties, talks by Bates faculty as well as visiting scholars, experts, and information nights. The program complements the Bates Votes initiative focused on voter education, registration, and mobilization.\n\nProfessor of Rhetoric, Film, and Screen Studies Stephanie Kelley-Romano, co-host of the trivia night event, talks with Colby Michaud \u201925 of Hopkinton, Mass., on Oct. 23, during a combined session of her course \u201cPresidential Campaign Rhetoric\u201d and Professor of Mathematics Meredith Greer\u2019s course \u201cMathematical Models in Biology.\u201d (Phyllis Graber Jensen/Bates College)\n\n\u201cOur goal with the whole series was to be very proactive during what we see as a very challenging campaign season,\u201d says Engel. \u201cSo there are a lot of things we\u2019re building into this series to help students, but also faculty and staff can take advantage of learning more, and just so they feel like they have a place to come to ask questions.\u201d\n\nWe asked Engel how a trivia night fits into helping students navigate a difficult election season. \u201cIt\u2019s an event where we\u2019re not really engaging with the election, but it keeps the election front of mind. And it\u2019s an event where students feel free to ask questions about registration, accessing the vote, and other ways they can be engaged,\u201d Engel says.\n\nIt\u2019s also about helping students gain a larger sense of familiarity with politics, opening up a dialogue, and creating community.\n\nStephen Engel, professor of politics and trivia night quizmaster, says the fun of trivia night has a purpose, so that when \u201cthings do get tense \u2014 because politics can get tense \u2014 you have that prior connection\u201d of being together in a politics-focuses event. (Carly Philpott \u201927 for Bates College)\n\n\u201cI find that a lot of students at Bates want to be politically engaged and but don\u2019t know how: Don\u2019t know how to find their information, don\u2019t know how to have these conversations. So this is a super low stakes way to laugh and learn stuff, like about the electoral college,\u201d says Kelley-Romano.\n\n\u201cCreating an opportunity for students to come together in a heated moment in a way that lowers the temperature a little bit and maybe builds community, so that when we do have a disagreement with another student, you can fall back on, \u2018But we hung out the night before,\u2019\u201d Engel says.\n\n\u201cSo when things do get tense \u2014 because politics can get tense \u2014 you have that prior connection. And it\u2019s events like this that build those connections.\u201d",

        "text": "Here\u2019s how election officials have boosted security since 2020\u2019s threats of violence\nAfter the polls closed in November 2020, Americans witnessed an unprecedented intersection of violent threats and voting.\n\nMen carrying rifles stood by with demonstrators outside vote tabulation sites in Arizona\u2019s Maricopa County and Las Vegas. In Detroit, people banged on the windows of Detroit\u2019s TFC Center. In Philadelphia, police arrested two armed men who had traveled from out of state outside the convention center.\n\nWATCH: Election officials speak out on the violent threats and stress they\u2019ve faced since 2020\n\nTwo months later, a violent mob stormed the U.S. Capitol in a failed attempt to prevent Congress from accepting results showing that Joe Biden won.\n\nThese incidents, along with death threats targeting election workers, have led local officials to increase their election security plans through Nov. 5 and, if necessary, beyond.\n\nAn overwhelming majority \u2014 92 percent \u2014 of surveyed local election officials said they had taken steps to increase security for voters, election workers and election infrastructure.\n\nElection officials say they are taking the threats seriously. But this fact is also true: Millions of Americans will cast a ballot without incident.\n\n\u201cVoting in America is safe and working at a vote counting center is also safe,\u201d said Seth Bluestein, a Republican city commissioner in Philadelphia who was working in a different city role at the convention center in 2020 as were counted. \u201cIn Philadelphia and jurisdictions across the county, election officials have taken a lot of lessons learned in 2020, and increased the security of ballot counting facilities.\u201d\n\nFederal law enforcement officials are on watch. The FBI and Homeland Security Department told election officials that domestic violent extremists could \u201cpromote narratives about the election process,\u201d which would motivate them to act violently, CNN reported in October. The bulletin cited the two assassination attempts against former President Donald Trump.\n\nThe federal government had warned earlier that absentee ballot drop boxes could be targeted with \u201cincendiary and explosive materials,\u201d according to Wired. Drop boxes, long used in some states to accept mail-in ballots, were not controversial until Trump raised fears about their security in 2020.\n\nPolitiFact interviewed current and former election officials about what they have done to mitigate violence and protect their staff and voters. Officials said they have taken extraordinary measures to prepare but remain on high alert.\n\nShatterproof glass, panic buttons and armed security: Preparing poll sites\n\nUrban battleground election offices are not the only places that have increased security.\n\nMore than 9,000 local jurisdictions administer elections nationwide, ranging from small townships to cities with more than 1 million voters. The 2024 Brennan Center for Justice survey found that 40 percent of respondents had enhanced physical security of election offices or polling places since 2020.\n\nVoters may notice certain security precautions when they cast their ballot, whether that\u2019s a security camera by a mail ballot drop box or police officers at an election office. Many state laws say that police can be summoned if needed, while a handful of laws say they can be regularly stationed at voting sites, and other states are silent.\n\nREAD MORE: From panic buttons to bulletproof glass, U.S. election officials are preparing for threats\n\n\u201cTo some people a uniformed officer represents safety, to others it represents a bad history of voter suppression at some point in time,\u201d said Justin Smith, a retired sheriff from Larimer County, Colorado.\n\nKathy Boockvar, secretary of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania during the 2020 election, said more jurisdictions nationwide have added panic buttons to contact law enforcement since 2020. Boockvar is a member of the Committee for Safe and Secure Elections, a group that trains election office workers.\n\nOther steps taken by election offices include adding materials on windows to make them shatterproof and hiring armed security at vote counting sites. Some offices have also added tighter identification requirements before entering a vote tabulation center.\n\nJosh Zygielbaum, the county clerk in Adams County, Colorado, and a Marine veteran, told PolitiFact in 2022 that he has a bulletproof vest. He said his office received threats in 2020, including a person \u201cwho said that they will see us on the battlefield and they will walk away alive.\u201d\n\nMore than one-third of local election officials in the Brennan survey reported that at some point during their job duties they had experienced threats, harassment or abuse.\n\nA Justice Department task force formed in 2021 to investigate election threats has prosecuted 18 people as of mid-October. Election officials say that\u2019s a small slice of the offenders.\n\nIntensive planning, evacuation routes\n\nMany precautions that state and local election officials take are invisible to voters. That includes meeting with law enforcement in the months leading up to Election Day, running disaster drills and writing plans showing how they will operate in an emergency.\n\nThe Committee for Safe and Secure Elections teaches election offices how to improve their security plans and deal with disruptive visitors. Smith, one of the group\u2019s trainers, said he encourages election officials to think about how they would handle upset voters and keep them from interfering with employees and ballot deliveries.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean you have a wall of police officers outside, it means you have a plan,\u201d Smith said. \u201cYou look at how your office is set up.\u201d\n\nSmith said that the 1999 Columbine school shooting was a wake-up call for schools and law enforcement to talk to each other. The threat of violence surrounding elections in 2020 was similarly a wake-up call for election workers and law enforcement.\n\nPierce County, Washington, was one of multiple election offices spanning a handful of states that received a letter with white powder in November 2023. The letter contained a typed threat: \u201cend elections now.\u201d\n\nLinda Farmer, the county auditor, said the county will now have multiple law enforcement officers at the center where votes are counted. Because of voting-by-mail\u2019s popularity in Washington state, the county also has extra hands to help secure ballot drop boxes and monitor traffic around the most frequently used drop box.\n\nCounty officials are ready for trouble at election sites.\n\n\u201cWe know how long it will take to clear if we have a bomb threat that turns out not to be real,\u201d Farmer said. \u201cWe know where we have to go if we have to shut down.\u201d\n\nCounting the vote in 2024: Tighter security, faster results\n\nOnly voters and election workers are generally allowed inside the rooms where voting happens. But when polls close, the work shifts to counting ballots, which sometimes means a change in location.\n\nMost states have laws that define the roles of observers and how many can be present. Political parties and campaigns appoint poll watchers who can observe voting and ask questions of election staff if they have concerns.\n\nAfter the polls close in Minnesota, \u201cthe law is less clear about access,\u201d Secretary of State Steve Simon said. \u201cOur legal advice to counties has been to let people in who want to watch consistent with everyday common sense policies. We aren\u2019t going to let a swarm of 50 people for all sorts of reasons, such as fire code, in every government building.\u201d\n\nIn Detroit in 2022, officials moved the vote counting site from the TCF Center \u2014 where people banged on the windows in 2020 \u2014 to Huntington Place Convention Center. Officials reported no chaos in the midterm election. The site had metal detectors and a weapons ban, the Detroit Free Press reported, and poll challengers had to undergo training and wear credentials.\n\nSome laws have changed to quicken vote-counting following the tide of 2020 misinformation that fueled frustration among people waiting for results. Michigan law, for example, now allows cities with a population of at least 5,000 to start processing absentee ballots eight days before Election Day.\n\nThe Maricopa County Tabulation and Election Center has built additional 10-foot high fencing and added more security cameras since 2020. When temporary staff and ballots are in the building, the center will have more police officers.\n\nElection offices have used federal money from the Help America Vote Act, as well as state or local money to pay for security improvements.\n\nBen Hovland, chair of the Election Assistance Commission, said the Help America Vote Act has provided about $1 billion in security grants since 2018. But when you take into account that it can cost one state $100 million to replace voting machines, the money doesn\u2019t stretch very far.\n\nThe grants are a critical piece of the election security puzzle, but election officials say they need more funding.\n\n\u201cElections are harder than they\u2019ve ever been to run and they are expensive,\u201d Hovland said.\n\nMore than 1,000 election offices nationwide since 2023 have had physical security assessments by the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. Local officials can take those recommendations to the boards that fund their offices.\n\nOnly some states ban guns at polls, vote counting centers\n\nPolling places are supposed to preserve what the Supreme Court has called an \u201cisland of calm\u201d for voters.\n\nAll states ban \u201celectioneering\u201d at polling sites, which generally means that people can\u2019t carry campaign signs inside a voting site.\n\nBut laws that expressly ban guns at voting sites are far less common.\n\nFollowing the 2020 election, more states have adopted laws restricting guns near election sites, but many still allow guns at certain election facilities. In Nevada, the Democratic-led Assembly passed a ban on guns near voting sites, but Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo vetoed it over constitutional concerns.\n\nMany states prohibit guns at schools and certain other places that are frequently used as polling locations. But the majority of states do not explicitly ban guns at all election sites. States have a smattering of laws \u2014 some of which ban open or concealed carry, or both \u2014 and only some ban guns at vote counting centers.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has been clear that states can prohibit guns at election sites, the Brennan Center found. Several states with high rates of gun ownership, such as Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana and Texas, have long prohibited firearms where people vote.\n\nThe Georgia Supreme Court wrote in 1874: \u201cThe practice of carrying arms at courts, elections and places of worship, etc., is a thing so improper in itself, so shocking to all sense of propriety, so wholly useless and full of evil, that it would be strange if the framers of the constitution have used words broad enough to give it a constitutional guarantee.\u201d\n\nThe Global Project Against Hate and Extremism found in a 2022 survey that restricting guns at the polls has widespread support, including among gun owners. Nearly 80 percent of Democrats supported a ban, as did more than 50 percent of Republicans and Independents.\n\nA September University of Chicago/NORC survey, however, found \u201cdisturbingly high levels of support for political violence\u201d and it was bipartisan, said Robert A. Pape, a political science professor at the University of Chicago, where he directs the Chicago Project on Security and Threats.\n\nNearly 6 percent of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that the \u201cuse of force is justified\u201d to restore Trump to the presidency. A little more than 8 percent agreed or strongly agreed that force was justified to prevent Trump from becoming president.\n\nAlthough election officials have concerns about security, they told us that they believe they are confident that voters can safely cast a ballot.\n\nBoockvar called on politicians to do their part to secure elections.\n\n\u201cWhat we really need to have happen more than anything else is every political party, every candidate running for office, everyone currently in office needs to lower the temperature and tell their people whether our candidate wins or loses our elections are won fairly and securely and the results audited, and if necessary recounted, and are observed in public by bipartisan officials.\u201d",

        "text": "With 12 days to go for US Presidential election, new poll shows Trump and Harris neck and neck nationally\nUS Presidential Elections Live Updates: The race to the White House has narrowed down to the last mile traversing by both Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. (AP)\n\nWith less than two weeks to go for the US Presidential election, a new survey has revealed that it is going to be a neck to neck contest between Democratic candidate Kamala Harris and Republican candidate Donald Trump, both nationally and in key battleground states.\n\nThe new poll, conducted by CNBC, suggests that Trump has a lead when it comes to economic issues and Harris races ahead when the subject of character, including honesty and the fitness to be the president comes up.\n\nIn the CNBC\u2019s \u201cAll-America Economic Survey\u201d, Trump garnered support from 48% of registered voters while Harris received around 46% support, with a two point difference which is well within the survey\u2019s margin of error at plus or minus 3.1 Advertisement Also Read | Donald Trump unfit to be president, claims VP Kamala Harris Meanwhile, the data further showed that Trump was leading with 48% against Harris\u2019 47% in the seven core battleground states \u2014 Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. But the margin of difference remained 1% which is again well within the margin of error. The survey was conducted between October 15-19 and 1,000 registered voters participated in the nationwide poll. The pollsters who carried out the survey claimed that inflation as an issue remained relevant and significant in this election as close to 63% of national voters said that their family income is falling behind the cost of living.

On the character issues and presidential quality, Harris raced ahead of Trump by 13 points nationally.\n\n\ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f",

        "text": "Critical climate issues at play for Catholics voting in 2024 presidential election\nFor Catholics still discerning their 2024 U.S. presidential election vote, environmental issues may not be among their top concerns \u2014 but, say climate experts, they should be.\n\n\u201cEnvironmental issues are pro-life issues,\u201d said Chris Payne, an assistant professor of biology at Franciscan University of Steubenville in Ohio. \u201cIf we want to live our lives holistically pro-life, then we must recognize that our daily decisions and actions impact the lives of many throughout God\u2019s created world.\u201d\n\nApproximately 37 percent of U.S. registered voters say climate change is important to them, according to a June 2024 survey by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication.\n\nBoth presidential nominees have been outspoken on environmental issues, although not in the same way.\n\nThe Republican nominee, former President Donald J. Trump, gives a glance at his ecological aims in his platform via \u201cCore Promises\u201d signaling a shift in energy and environmental policy \u2014 such as, \u201cMake America the dominant energy producer in the world\u201d and \u201cCancel the electric vehicle mandate.\u201d\n\nTrump has, however, caught more environmental attention for his frequent exclamations of \u201cDrill, baby, drill!\u201d emphasizing plans for increased fossil fuel extraction and use, regulatory rollbacks, and the downsizing of renewable energy policies \u2014 all designed, he has said, to reduce energy costs and increase American competitiveness.\n\n\u201cGenuine conservation efforts\u201d are mentioned in the Republican Party platform, but other proposed environmental policies \u2014 like Trump\u2019s \u201cCore Promises\u201d \u2014 are predominately energy- related.\n\nDemocratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 campaign website likewise emphasizes energy policies, but also specifically mentions the climate crisis \u2014 promising to unite Americans on the issue, advance environmental justice, increase resilience to climate disasters, protect public lands and health, lower household energy costs, create clean energy jobs, and hold polluters accountable. These goals closely align with the Democratic Party platform, which also stresses America\u2019s role in global climate leadership.\n\n\u201cBoth candidates have histories, certainly, on climate and environmental issues,\u201d said Catholic Climate Covenant executive director and founder Dan Misleh. Launched by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops in 2006, the covenant is supported by more than 20 national partners.\n\n\u201cThose histories,\u201d Misleh emphasized, \u201care very, very different. President Trump pulled out of the Paris Agreement, and the Biden-Harris administration got back in.\u201d\n\nThe Paris Agreement is a legally binding international climate change treaty adopted by 196 Parties at the U.N. Climate Change Conference in Paris during December 2015. Signing countries pledge actions to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, in an attempt to halt the march of warming temperatures across the globe.\n\nAccording to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 2023 was \u2014 by a wide margin \u2014 the warmest year since global records began in 1850. The United Nations reports that rising temperatures can cause more severe storms, increased drought, a warming and rising ocean, loss of species, famine and poverty, and health risks.\n\nThe Biden administration, Misleh noted, \u201calso committed the largest investment in the history of the world into clean energy; into climate adaptation and mitigation; and into new environmental justice \u2014 whereas the Trump-Pence administration did none of those things, and kind of took us backwards a little bit.\u201d\n\nAnna Johnson \u2014 North American senior programs manager for the Laudato Si\u2019 Movement, a global network of 900-plus Catholic organizations and over 10,000 trained grassroots leaders \u2014 echoed Pope Francis\u2019 urgent ecological message in his two environmental treatises, the encyclical \u201cLaudato Si'\u201d (2015) and the apostolic exhortation \u201cLaudate Deum\u201d (2023).\n\n\u201cPope Francis wrote, a year ago, \u2018Laudate Deum\u2019 \u2014 and he says, \u2018The world in which we live is collapsing, and may be nearing the breaking point,'\u201d Johnson noted. \u201cAnd scientific facts that are coming out are just showing this to be increasingly true.\u201d\n\nRecently released preliminary findings from a team of international researchers indicate the amount of carbon absorbed by land, trees and plants \u2014 a critical process to keep CO2 levels from rising \u2014 has temporarily collapsed, with almost no carbon absorbed in 2023. As NASA notes, \u201cThe more carbon dioxide they absorb during photosynthesis, the less carbon dioxide remains trapped in the atmosphere, where it can cause temperatures to rise.\u201d\n\nFor Johnson \u2014 who has witnessed climate impacts from the Philippines to Uganda to Guatemala and even the American heartland, where farmers say the growing seasons are changing and their tomatoes aren\u2019t ripening \u2014 such developments are more than just concerning. They\u2019re an active threat.\n\n\u201cThese are terrifying, gut-wrenching scientific realities that have deep impacts upon all of humanity \u2014 everyone,\u201d she said. \u201cFrom people living half a world away from me to our own children.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere will definitely be environmental work done with (these candidates),\u201d Johnson reflected. \u201cI think it is urgently important that each Catholic take a deep look at each candidate\u2019s platform, and really discern what that level of work will look like, and how they see a viable future for us, and our children, and grandchildren living on this planet.\u201d\n\nMisleh agreed, while noting that, of course, no candidate is perfect.\n\n\u201cI think the most important thing is that we learn the issues; we learn the candidates\u2019 positions on the issues; we look at the candidates\u2019 character, and history, and all of those things \u2014 and then go to the voting booth,\u201d advised Misleh. \u201cCatholics are called to be deeply engaged in political life, because political life helps to promote \u2014 or not \u2014 the common good.\u201d\n\nCaring for the environment, Payne observed, is intimately tied to a person\u2019s own humanity, as well as loving and serving God.\n\n\u201cOur being is made in the image of God \u2014 i.e., we universally share the vocation to love God, self, and neighbor so as to grow in relationship with God and become fully participatory in the love of the Trinity \u2014 and this vocation to love must be lived out in the context of loving relationship with the whole human family and all of Creation,\u201d he explained.\n\nHe pointed to an imperative found in the Catechism of the Catholic Church: \u201cGod created everything for man, but man in turn was created to serve and love God and to offer all creation back to him.\u201d\n\nWith this in mind, suggested Payne, \u201ccare for creation is simply one of many holistically pro-life ways to fulfill our vocation to love.\u201d\n\nPayne was also clear that, while \u201cthe world is not going to blow up into a giant ball of fire,\u201d humans do bear responsibility for producing negative effects.\n\n\u201cWe do have to recognize that evidence is clear that humans have had and continue to have global impacts on our world: climate, species, ecosystems and one another,\u201d said Payne. \u201cImportantly, no matter what changes are occurring, the effects are and will continue to be felt first and foremost by the poor, whom we are called to have a special option for.\u201d\n\nUltimately, said Misleh, \u201cthere\u2019s so much we can do \u2014 as individuals; as families; as church communities \u2014 to help respect God\u2019s creation. \u2026 We have to do that in our daily choices \u2014 in what we do; what we buy; what we eat. All of those things have impacts on the environment.\u201d\n\nThose activities, said Misleh, extend beyond Nov. 5.\n\n\u201cClimate and environment policies are one issue that we need to bring to the voting booth \u2014 there are lots of others,\u201d he commented. \u201cI would encourage people to understand Catholic social doctrine, and our Gospels \u2014 and bring that to the voting booth.\u201d\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 OSV News\n\nPrint",

His recent research has examined election subversion and how courts can prevent state officials from undermining election results, and reducing election litigation, which identifies the explosion in spending in election-related litigation in the last decade and what can be done to reduce it.\n\n\u201cDerek\u2019s selection by CNN as an election law contributor underscores the vital role that scholars play as public intellectuals,\u201d said G. Marcus Cole, the Joseph A. Matson Dean and Professor of Law at Notre Dame Law School. \u201cHis expertise will help illuminate the complexities of election law for the public, providing objective analysis that is essential in a time when informed discourse is more important than ever.\u201d\n\nMuller has been interviewed by CNN\u2019s Laura Coates and Jim Acosta in the aftermath of eligibility decisions that kept former President Donald Trump\u2019s name off the ballot during the 2024 presidential primaries. He was quoted by John Fritze and Marshall Cohen about how courts or Congress might handle challenges to Trump\u2019s eligibility. And he has spoken with Tierney Sneed about potential legal issues after President Joe Biden announced he would not seek reelection.\n\nMuller testified before the United States Senate in support of the Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act, a law that was enacted in 2022. The law reduces ambiguities in language, gives clear deadlines for resolving election disputes and makes it harder for Congress to challenge the outcome of presidential elections. Muller described how the act will work in commentary at The Conversation. The new law will play a crucial role this year when electors meet to cast their votes on December 17 and when Congress convenes to count votes on January 6, 2025.\n\nA member of the American Law Institute, Muller is the co-reporter on a new Restatement of the Law, Election Litigation. He has published extensively, and his op-eds have appeared in the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and the Los Angeles Times. Muller has testified before Congress and is a regular contributor at the Election Law Blog and The Conversation.\n\nEstablished in 1869, Notre Dame Law School is the oldest Catholic law school in the United States. The Law School\u2019s approach to legal education is informed and inspired by faith. Students are trained to view the law as a vocation in service to others, to explore the moral and ethical dimensions of the law, and to discover their unique roles in furthering the cause of justice.\n\nContact: Derek T.

Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., attend a campaign event Monday, Oct. 21, 2024, in Brookfield, Wis. (AP Photo/Morry Gash) Republican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump participates in a roundtable with Latino leaders Tuesday, Oct. 22, 2024, in Doral, Fla. (AP Photo/Lynne Sladky)\n\nMillions of Americans can\u2019t afford to buy a home or rent a suitable apartment, making housing a central issue for voters in the upcoming presidential election.\n\nThe biggest single reason homeownership is out of reach for many is there aren\u2019t nearly enough homes for sale to balance out the market between buyers and sellers.\n\nThe shortfall, which some economists say ranges from 1 million to around 4 million homes, has for the better part of the last decade fueled bidding wars that boosted the median sales price of a previously occupied U.S. home to an all-time high of $426,900 in June \u2014 even as home sales have been in a deep slump for more than two years.\n\nHigher mortgage rates have also kept many home shoppers on the sidelines. The average rate on a 30-year mortgage rose to a 23-year high of nearly 8% late last year, and now sits at 6.44%.\n\nRenters haven\u2019t had it any easier. While the median U.S. asking rent has been easing for more than a year following a wave of new apartment construction, it remains roughly 20% higher than it was before the pandemic.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have put out proposals that they contend will make the American Dream accessible to more Americans.\n\nHarris\u2019 campaign has laid out a detailed roadmap of policies aimed at expanding access to affordable housing both for homebuyers and renters that includes offering first-time homebuyers up to $25,000 in down payment assistance and tax incentives for builders and federal funds for cities to speed up construction. She claims her plan will add 3 million new housing units over the next four years.\n\nTrump says he will create tax incentives for homebuyers, cut \u201cunnecessary\u201d regulations on home construction and make some federal land available for residential construction, though the campaign\u2019s platform doesn\u2019t include any details. Trump also claims that he will lower housing costs by reducing inflation and stopping illegal immigration.\n\nSetting aside the fact that many of the candidates\u2019 policies would require support from a majority of lawmakers in Congress, which the next president may not have, economists say the campaigns\u2019 platforms offer some good ideas, but no sure fixes to the housing market\u2019s longstanding challenges.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at some of the candidates\u2019 key ideas:\n\nTrump\u2019s immigration crackdown\n\nTrump and his campaign have repeatedly tied the nation\u2019s housing woes to immigration, suggesting mass deportations will ease the demand for homes, thus making housing more available and affordable.\n\nThe former president has long focused broadly on undocumented immigrants as a core political issue, but when it comes to housing policy, his campaign has also pointed fingers at immigrants who are legally in the country too. His running mate, the Ohio Senator JD Vance, has blamed Haitian immigrants living in his home state for causing a housing problem.\n\nChris Herbert, managing director of Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies, said in a statement that rising interest rates and the pandemic-era spike in housing demand are to blame for rising costs \u2014\u2013 not immigrants.\n\n\u201cWhile immigrants do add to overall housing demand, they cannot be blamed for the recent surge in home prices and rents that took off in 2020 and 2021, as immigration reached its lowest levels in decades due to the pandemic,\u201d Herbert said.\n\nJim Tobin, CEO of the National Association of Home Builders, said mass deportations could make the supply problem worse because one-third of the homebuilding industry\u2019s labor force is foreign born.\n\n\u201cAnything that potentially disrupts the inflow of foreign-born labor into our industry would be disruptive. No doubt about it,\u201d Tobin said.\n\nSarah Saadian, senior vice president of public policy at the National Low Income Housing Coalition, said undocumented people tend to live in overcrowded units, so the eviction of only immigrants in a home wouldn\u2019t create an actual vacancy, nor does it address the affordability dilemma.\n\n\u201cThe most pressing part is wages and incomes aren\u2019t high enough to cover rental costs and that doesn\u2019t really have anything to do with undocumented people,\u201d Saadian said.\n\nHarris\u2019 $25,000 down-payment plan\n\nHarris aims to directly aid home shoppers by providing up to $25,000 in down-payment assistance to first-time buyers who have paid their rent on time for two years.\n\nThe campaign, which claims the program would help more than 4 million first-time buyers and cost $100 billion, says that such down-payment assistance is not new, noting that as of 2019 nearly three-quarters of single-family mortgages included down payment aid provided by state housing finance agencies.\n\nLike Trump\u2019s plan, Harris\u2019 proposal could backfire in a way. Economists warn that introducing a buyer incentive when the supply of homes for sale remains tight in many markets could juice prices, making homeownership less affordable. The impact could depend on the particular market. The impact could depend on the particular market.\n\n\u201cIn Los Angeles, $25,000 down payment assistance is not enough, but it is enough in Detroit,\u201d said Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at Redfin.\n\nStill, if the number of homes on the market grows, the financial assistance makes more sense, because it can reassure homebuilders that \u201cthere will be buyers willing to buy\u201d the homes they build, Fairweather said.\n\nThe federal government has offered tax incentives to homebuyers in the not too distant past. In 2008, the Obama Administration enacted a first-time homebuyer tax credit of up to $,7,500 as the housing market reeled from a housing crash and the Great Recession. It pulled forward sales as buyers seized on the incentive, but the housing market remained in a slump until 2012.\n\nThe Trump campaign promises to make homeownership affordable for \u201cfamilies, young people, and everyone,\u201d but doesn\u2019t offer specifics. It mentions that the GOP will \u201csupport first-time buyers\u201d and claims it will reduce mortgage rates by \u201cslashing\u201d inflation.\n\nHowever, experts say Trump\u2019s overall economic agenda in a second term would worsen inflation, which fell last month to its lowest point in more than three years.\n\nAgreed: zoning and federal lands\n\nAmong the few things the two candidates do agree on: easing up on zoning laws and using federal lands to build homes.\n\nTrump has pledged to tackle zoning and other construction regulations in order to accelerate housing production, though his platform doesn\u2019t go into details.\n\nHarris is proposing a $40 billion fund to spur local governments, which control zoning laws, to streamline their regulations in order to cut down on the time it takes for builders to get projects cleared and completed. One caveat: state and local governments have to show that they\u2019re building housing that is affordable.\n\nBoth candidates have also said, however vaguely, that they\u2019re in favor of making \u201climited portions\u201d of or \u201ccertain\u201d federal land available for home construction.\n\nHarris\u2019 plan points to the Biden administration\u2019s initiative in Las Vegas, where the Bureau of Land Management sold off 20 acres at a steep discount for Clark County to build single-family homes that will eventually be sold to those with an annual household income of up to $70,000.\n\nDon Simpson, the vice president of the Public Lands Foundation, said the laws were set more than 20 years ago to give Nevada authorities the ability to buy federal land at below market rate for affordable housing. Simpson said there are other small parcels near places like Barstow, California, and Boise, Idaho where this could be replicated on a limited basis.\n\nNicholas Irwin, a University of Nevada Las Vegas professor, said the 210 homes will hardly make a dent in the estimated 75,000-unit shortage that Southern Nevada needs today.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re short by a lot. More federal land alone isn\u2019t going to solve this,\u201d Irwin said.",

        "text": "US presidential election updates: Republicans in damage control after racist Puerto Rico comments at Trump rally\nThe fight for Puerto Rican voters emerged as an unlikely campaign theme on Sunday, after superstar Bad Bunny backed Kamala Harris for president, minutes after a speaker at Donald Trump\u2019s triumphalist New York rally made racist remarks about the US territory.\n\nComedian Tony Hinchcliffe, speaking ahead of Trump at the rally in Madison Square Garden, said \u201cthere\u2019s literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now, I think it\u2019s called Puerto Rico.\u201d\n\nMillions of mainland US residents with Puerto Rican heritage will be voting on 5 November and the Trump campaign was quick to distance itself from the joke. A slew of Republicans also condemned the remarks, including Rick Scott and Mar\u00eda Elvira Salazar from Florida, the state with the largest population of Puerto Ricans in the United States mainland.\n\nHere\u2019s what else happened on Sunday:\n\nKamala Harris election news\n\nHarris made a pitch for Puerto Rican voters, addressing the need to drive economic growth and job creation. The US territory has struggled after several hurricanes smashed the power grid and faced austerity measures after the local government filed for bankruptcy. Harris promised more effective use of recovery funds for the territory and discussed her plans while visiting a Puerto Rican restaurant in Pennsylvania. Of the swing state\u2019s eligible Latino voters, 580,000 are of Puerto Rican descent.\n\nHarris was in Philadelphia, the largest city in Pennsylvania, on her 14th trip to the state since Joe Biden withdrew from the race. The vice-president spoke at a church service in west Philadelphia and answered questions on student loan debt at a nearby barbershop.\n\nAt a rally on Sunday evening, Harris told supporters \u201cno one can sit on the sidelines\u201d ahead of the election, adding: \u201cmake no mistake: we will win.\u201d Harris also targeted younger voters in the crowd. \u201cYou are rightly impatient for change,\u201d she said. \u201cYou, who have only known the climate crisis \u2026 You, who grew up with active shooter drills. You, who right now know fewer rights than your mothers and grandmothers.\u201d\n\nHarris and her husband, Doug Emhoff, released statements acknowledging the sixth anniversary of a mass shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh . \u201cSix years ago today, a white supremacist committed the deadliest attack on American Jews in our nation\u2019s history,\u201d Emhoff wrote. \u201cWe honor the lives of those lost on that horrific day by continuing our fight against antisemitism and hate in all its forms.\u201d\n\nGovernor Tim Walz joined Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to play the American football video game Madden on a Twitch livestream and talk about the election. The unconventional campaign appearance came as the Harris-Walz campaign tried to drum up support among young male voters.\n\nDonald Trump election news\n\nTrump\u2019s Madison Square Garden rally was marked by racist comments, coarse insults, and dangerous threats about immigrants. Businessman Grant Cardone said Harris \u201cand her pimp handlers will destroy our country\u201d, while Tucker Carlson mocked Harris\u2019s racial background: \u201cAs the first Samoan Malaysian low IQ, former California prosecutor to ever be elected president, no, she\u2019s not impressive.\u201d Wrestler Hulk Hogan, Dr Phil star Phil McGraw, and a rare surprise appearance from Melania Trump also garnered cheers from the 20,000 attenders.\n\nTrump promised to introduce a new tax credit for family caregivers and doubled down on his anti-immigration rhetoric. He said his administration would pursue the death penalty for migrants who kill Americans and that he would invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798.\n\nTrump\u2019s running mate, JD Vance, avoided calling Russia an \u201cenemy\u201d in an interview on Meet the Press. Vance said Russian President Vladimir Putin was \u201cclearly an adversary\u201d but \u201cwe have to be smart about diplomacy\u201d.\n\nChinese state-affiliated hackers intercepted audio from the phone calls of US political figures, including an unnamed campaign adviser of Donald Trump, the Washington Post reported Sunday. Various media outlets reported on Friday that the Trump campaign was made aware last week that the Republican presidential candidate and his running mate JD Vance were among a number of people inside and outside government whose phone numbers were targeted through the infiltration of Verizon phone systems.\n\nElsewhere on the campaign trail\n\nHarris\u2019s campaign has delayed taking up Joe Biden\u2019s offers to campaign for his vice-president, Axios reports. \u201cPresident Biden wants to campaign for vice-president Harris in the last days before the election,\u201d the outlet writes. \u201cHarris\u2019 campaign keeps responding: We\u2019ll get back to you, three people familiar with the dynamic told Axios.\u201d The president will cast his early-voting ballot in the presidential election on Monday, according to the White House.\n\nAn array of big tech executives have spoken with Donald Trump in recent days, seeking to rekindle their relationships with the ex-president as the possibility of his return to office looms, CNN reports. In recent weeks, Apple\u2019s Tim Cook, Google\u2019s Sundar Pichai and Amazon\u2019s Andy Jassy have all called Trump. Earlier this summer, Meta\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg also reached out to Trump after his attempted assassination in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nRead more about the 2024 US election:",

        "text": "US Election 2024: You can\u2019t miss THESE key dates, events, swing states in presidential polls\nApproximately 244 million people are eligible to vote in the upcoming US presidential election on November 5. In 2020, about two-thirds of these eligible voters participated. The outcome of the next presidential election will hinge less on the national voter turnout and more on a few thousand voters in key battleground or swing states.\n\nIn-person voting for the 2024 presidential election began on September 20, marking the start of a six-week countdown to election day following a turbulent summer in American politics.\n\nThis period included President Joe Biden's withdrawal from the race after a poor debate performance on June 27, leading to Vice President Kamala Harris being named the Democratic nominee.\n\nKey events of US elections 2024 Here are some key dates and events related to the US presidential election 2024:\n\nSeptember 10, 2024: Donald Trump and Kamala Harris faced off in their first presidential debate.\n\nOctober 1, 2024: The vice presidential debate took place, featuring Minnesota\u2019s Democratic Governor Tim Walz and Ohio Republican Senator J.D. Vance.\n\nNovember 5, 2024: Voters across the United States will cast their ballots for president.\n\nNovember 25, 2024: The last day for 17 states and the District of Columbia to accept postal votes postmarked by Election Day.\n\nDecember 11, 2024: Electors in each state will officially cast their votes for president and vice president.\n\nDecember 17, 2024: Deadline for the 538 electoral college votes to arrive in Washington.\n\nJanuary 6, 2025: Electoral college votes will be formally counted before Congress.\n\nJanuary 20, 2025: The elected president and vice president will be inaugurated and officially take office.\n\nIt is to be further noted that American voters are increasingly taking advantage of early voting facilities, with 47 states and the District of Columbia offering early voting options for all voters. The only exceptions are Mississippi, Alabama, and New Hampshire, where mail-in ballots are not available, requiring voters to go to polling stations.\n\nWhat are nominees promises? Harris has stated that her top priority from day one will be to lower food and housing costs for working families. She plans to prohibit price-gouging on groceries, assist first-time home buyers, and offer incentives to boost housing supply.\n\nWhile inflation surged during Biden's presidency\u2014partly due to post-Covid supply chain disruptions and the Ukraine conflict\u2014it has since decreased. Trump has vowed to \"end inflation and make America affordable again.\" He claims that increasing oil drilling will reduce energy prices, and he promises to lower interest rates, although this is not within presidential control. Additionally, he believes that deporting undocumented immigrants will relieve housing pressure. However, economists caution that his proposal to raise taxes on imports could lead to higher prices.\n\nWhat are the seven swing states in the US elections in 2024? The US Elections have seven swing states, the ones that do not favour any one party over the other.\n\nArizona (Electoral Votes: 11)\n\nArizona has become a key battleground in the national immigration debate. Recently, border crossings have decreased from record highs, making immigration a top concern for voters.\n\nAdditionally, Arizona has seen contentious debates over abortion access, highlighted by state Republicans' unsuccessful attempt to reinstate a near-total ban on abortions from 160 years ago.\n\nGeorgia (Electoral Votes: 16)\n\nGeorgia has a significant African-American population, making up about a third of its residents, which played a crucial role in Biden's victory in 2020. This demographic's support is believed to have been instrumental in flipping the state blue.\n\nNorth Carolina (Electoral Votes: 16)\n\nPolling in North Carolina has tightened since Harris took the lead on the Democratic ticket, with some analysts now labeling the state a \u201ctoss-up.\u201d This shift may be influencing Trump's decision to hold his first outdoor rally there since the assassination attempt in July.\n\nPennsylvania (Electoral Votes: 19)\n\nIn the 2020 election, Pennsylvania played a key role in helping Joe Biden secure the presidency and reclaim the \u201cblue wall.\u201d Historically, Democratic candidates have had significant success in the state until Donald Trump's win in 2016.\n\nNevada ((Electoral Votes: 6)\n\nDespite having the fewest electoral votes among the seven swing states, Nevada remains crucial in presidential elections. Biden's 2020 victory was the fourth straight win for Democratic candidates in the Silver State, but the margins were narrow in both 2020 and 2016, when Clinton also secured a win.\n\nWisconsin (Electoral Votes: 10)\n\nWisconsin has been pivotal in both the 2016 and 2020 elections, with the winning candidate decided by just over 20,000 votes each time. Analysts believe that third-party candidates could significantly influence outcomes in marginal states like Wisconsin, especially as they campaign against the dominant two parties.\n\nMichigan (Electoral votes: 15)",

        "text": "Harris regains slight lead nationally yet Electoral College holds the cards: POLL\nVice President Kamala Harris has regained a slight lead among likely voters nationally in the latest ABC News/Ipsos poll, albeit with the race close enough to leave the outcome of the 2024 presidential election to the uncertainties of the Electoral College.\n\nDemocratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris speaks at a campaign rally at James R. Hallford Stadium, Oct. 24, 2024, in Clarkston, Ga. Julia Demaree Nikhinson/AP\n\nTurnout is key. Just 2 percentage points divide Harris and Donald Trump among all registered voters, 49-47%. This goes to a slight Harris advantage among likely voters, 51-47%, with some pro-Harris groups showing a bit more propensity to vote.\n\nVote Preferences. Among likely voters ABC News/Ipsos and ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos polls\n\nCompared with earlier this month, Harris has regained a more customary Democratic advantage among Hispanic people and widened her advantage among suburban women, while remaining strong in core groups including Black people. Trump pushes back in rural areas and among non-college white men, and runs competitively among younger men.\n\nSee PDF for full results.\n\nIssues\n\nThe candidates divide the pie in trust to handle top issues. Trump's best include immigration, with a 12-point advantage over Harris among registered voters; the economy overall, +8 points; inflation, +7; and the conflict in the Middle East, also +7. Harris responds with double-digit leads in trust to handle abortion (+15) and health care (+10); she's also 8 points ahead in trust to handle \"protecting American democracy\" and +6 on helping the middle class.\n\nThe economy and inflation continue as prominent concerns, with 90% and 85% of registered voters, respectively, calling these highly important in their vote. But this poll, produced for ABC by Langer Research Associates, with fieldwork by Ipsos, finds a shift in intensity: The shares assigning topmost importance to the economy or inflation, calling them \"one of the single most important issues\" in their vote, have declined by 7 points apiece since September.\n\nIssue Importance and Trust. Among registered voters ABC NEWS/IPSOS POLL\n\nAny shift from economic concerns likely would aid Harris, given her shortfall in trust to handle the issue and dissatisfaction with the Biden administration's economic performance. President Joe Biden labors with just a 36% job approval rating; differentiating herself from him has been a challenge for Harris. She has 95% support among registered voters who approve of Biden's job performance, compared with 16% among the majority who disapprove.\n\nNotably, as well, protecting democracy ranks nearly as high as inflation in importance, cited by 81%. That's well above the importance of immigration, which Trump has been hitting hard, and abortion, a central focus for Harris. But these reflect partisan realities: Democrats are far more apt than others to pick abortion as a top issue; Republicans, to select immigration.\n\nIssue Importance by Partisanship. Among registered voters ABC NEWS/IPSOS POLL\n\nAttributes\n\nWhile they battle on issues, Harris continues to lead Trump on most personal attributes. Assessed head-to-head, Harris leads Trump by 11 points, 49-38%, in being seen as having the mental sharpness it takes to serve effectively as president -- a measure on which Trump had led Biden by 31 points.\n\nHarris' advantage widens to 29 points on having the physical health to serve effectively; she's also more apt than Trump to be seen as honest and trustworthy, by 15 points; to understand the problems of people like you, by 10 points; and to share your personal values, by 8 points.\n\nThat said, there is a remaining personal attribute on which Trump runs essentially evenly with Harris, one that may matter in an unstable world: being trusted in a crisis. Forty-three percent pick Harris on this, 41%, Trump.\n\nPreference on Personal Attributes. Among registered voters ABC NEWS/IPSOS POLL\n\nThese aren't the only differences in views of the candidates' attributes. As reported Friday, registered voters are twice as likely to call Trump a fascist as to say this about Harris, and 16 points more likely to think he often says things that are not true. But they're also 5 points more likely to think Harris rather than Trump makes proposals just to win votes, not that she intends to carry out.\n\nVoter groups\n\nEight percent of adults (and 10% of registered voters) say they've already voted (as of early last week); a disproportionately Democratic group, they went 62-33% for Harris.\n\nThis poll finds a notable shift in vote preferences among Hispanic people, 12% of likely voters and a potentially important group given the close contest, especially in the battleground states of Arizona and Nevada. Biden won Hispanic people by 33 points in 2020, per the ABC News exit poll, and Harris leads in this group by a similar 30 points now, 64-34% -- compared with 55-43% in early October.\n\nVote by Group ABC News/Ipsos and 2020 ABC News exit polls\n\nTrump has some offsets to Harris' gain among Hispanic people. He now is +41 points among white men without college degrees, essentially matching his showing in this group in the 2020 ABC News exit poll, and also +41 points among rural voters.\n\nAdditionally, men younger than 40 were +6 points for Harris early this month; now they're +5 for Trump. This change is not statistically significant, nor is the difference between the candidates, given sample sizes. Nonetheless, the result stands in striking contrast to preferences among women younger than 40, who favor Harris by a 34-point margin.\n\nTrump is a slight +6 among men overall, Harris +14 among women \u2013 almost exactly the average gender gap in presidential elections since 1996. This includes a 19-point lead for Harris among suburban women, vs. a slight 10-point margin for her in this group earlier in October.\n\nRepublican presidential nominee, former U.S. President Donald Trump speaks at a Turning Point Action campaign rally, Oct. 24, 2024, in Las Vegas. Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n\nThe longstanding gender gap in presidential preference reflects the fact that women are more apt than men to be Democrats -- by 13 points among likely voters in this poll. This also appears in issue importance, with women more apt than men, by double digits, to pick both abortion and health care as top issues in their vote choice.\n\nMany of these results among groups are similar to those in the 2020 exit poll. In one difference, Harris outperforms Biden four years ago among college-educated white women. She's also strong among college graduates overall.\n\nAnother difference, though, is an important one for Trump: He's essentially even with Harris among independents, a group Biden won by 13 points in 2020, vs. a scant Harris +1 now. The candidate who's won independents has won nine of the last 12 presidential elections.\n\nTurnout\n\nOverall vote preferences are essentially even among the general population (Harris +1) and registered voters (Harris +2) alike. As noted, this inches to a slight Harris +4 among likely voters.\n\nThe shift toward Harris among likely voters relies in part on consolidated support among Democratic base groups, notably Black people and liberals. While Harris has a 70-point advantage among all Black people, that widens to 83 points among Black likely voters, 90-7%. Ninety-six percent of liberal likely voters support Harris, vs. 91% of liberals overall. Additionally, she goes from 53% support among all suburban women to 59% among those likely to vote. Trump, by contrast, doesn't see significant bumps in support among likely voters.\n\nSupporters hold up signs as Democratic presidential nominee U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris speaks during her campaign rally along with former U.S. President Barack Obama in Atlanta, Oct. 24, 2024. Megan Varner/Reuters\n\nIdentifying likely voters entails estimation, and it can be a moving target as the campaigns work overtime to motivate turnout for their candidate and demotivate it for their opponent.\n\nIn one potential indicator of turnout, the candidates are close in voter enthusiasm -- 88% of Harris supporters are enthusiastic about her, as are 85% of Trump's about him. In another, Harris maintains a slight edge in voter contact, with Americans overall 5 points more apt to have been contacted by her campaign than by Trump's. In the seven battleground states, though, it's a non-significant 4 points -- and the 50-47% race there remains the equivalent of a dead heat.\n\nMethodology\n\nThis ABC News/Ipsos poll was conducted online via the probability-based Ipsos KnowledgePanel\u00ae Oct. 18-22, 2024, in English and Spanish, among a random national sample of 2,808 adults, including 2,392 registered voters and 1,913 likely voters. Partisan divisions among all adults are 29-29-30%, Democrats-Republicans-independents; 32-32-29% among registered voters; and 35-35-27% among likely voters.\n\nResults have a margin of sampling error of 2 percentage points, including the design effect, for the full sample and for registered voters, 2.5 points for likely voters and 5.5 points for likely voters in the battleground states, Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Sampling error is not the only source of differences in polls.\n\nThe survey was produced for ABC News by Langer Research Associates, with sampling and data collection by Ipsos.

        "summary": " Poll: Nearly half of Americans think members of the opposing political party are 'evil' New polling data from the SNF Agora Institute at Johns Hopkins University . Half of respondents think Democrats will accept the outcome of the election if they lose in November . Less than half of Democrats consider Republicans evil .",
        "text": "Poll: Nearly half of Americans think members of the opposing political party are 'evil'\nMedia Inquiries Name Hannah Robbins Email hlrobbins@jhu.edu Cell phone 667-232-9047\n\nNearly half of the U.S. electorate thinks members of the opposing party aren't just wrong for politics\u2014they're \"downright evil\", according to new polling data from the SNF Agora Institute at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nThree-quarters of Republicans who still believe former President Donald Trump won the presidential election in 2020 \"somewhat agree\" or \"strongly agree\" that Democrats are \"downright evil.\" Only 27% of Republicans who think President Joe Biden won in 2020 agree with the sentiment. Meanwhile, less than half of Democrats consider Republicans evil.\n\n\"Vilifying our political opponents is a signal that we consider them to be enemies instead of opponents,\" said Lilliana Mason, a Johns Hopkins University political science professor who studies political violence and polarization. \"The work of governing a democracy requires compromise and mutual respect. These sentiments make that respect nearly impossible, which threatens the health of democracy.\"\n\nMason and Scott Warren, who co-led the project at the SNF Agora Institute, commissioned the poll as part of an effort to better understand the U.S. electorate leading up to the 2024 presidential election. They worked with YouGov, a polling and data company based in the United Kingdom, to survey eligible voters. The poll is the second of four scheduled panel interviews to survey the same group of respondents. The first poll was conducted from July 26 to July 30, and the second one from Sept. 6 to Sept. 18.\n\nRespondents answered questions about their party affiliations, their political identities, the 2020 election results, where they get their information, and what they think about people from other parties. Findings are based on survey answers from 2,000 respondents who make up a demographically and politically representative sample of the U.S. electorate.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has gained three points, with the percentage of respondents who would vote for her increasing from 43% to 46% since July; the percentage who would vote for former President Trump stayed at 42%. The results, the researchers noted, may differ from other national polls because the data is not passed through a likely voter screen, weighted to any prior election results, or weighted to match a likely voter profile.\n\nThe poll examined voters' attitudes toward women and minorities in an election featuring a candidate who is the nation's first female and biracial vice president.\n\nData from the two surveys suggests a growing divide between Republicans known as \"election deniers\" and the rest of the electorate, the researchers said, especially around issues of gender and race.\n\n\"2020 election denialism has become an identity issue as much as a substantive policy measure,\" said Warren, an SNF Agora fellow. \"Republicans who do believe in the results of the 2020 election have strikingly pro-democracy viewpoints and may feel that they don't have a political home at this moment in time. Figuring out how to include them in our democracy is critical at this moment.\"\n\nRepublican election deniers are less likely to think a woman should be president, the data suggests, with 28% believing women are better suited to take care of a home than to work a job, compared to 21% of independents, 20% of Republicans who believe Biden won in 2020, and 17% of Democrats.\n\nAdditionally, most election deniers\u2014more than 80%\u2014\"strongly agree\" or \"somewhat agree\" that Black Americans should overcome prejudices and work their way up \"without any special favors\" in the same way \"Irish, Italian, and Jewish ethnicities\" once did.\n\nWhen asked about which issues most motivate them during voting, election deniers and Republicans who believe Biden won in 2020 prioritize the economy, immigration, and crime. Democrats say they care most about abortion, the economy, and democracy. And independents rank the economy, immigration, and abortion as their top issues when casting their votes in November.\n\nOther findings include:\n\nPoll respondents have grown more worried that the opposing party will not accept the outcome of the election if they lose in November; overall, more respondents trust Democrats to concede the election if they lose than Republicans. One-quarter of respondents are not sure Democrats will concede the election if they lose, up from 23% in July. And 36% of respondents are not sure Republicans will concede the election if they lose, up from 34% in July. Half of respondents think Democrats will accept the outcome if they lose, while only 26% think Republicans will do the same.\n\nFewer Republicans and Democrats think it's important to accept the outcome of the election regardless of the winner. In July, 91% of Republicans who believe Biden won in 2020 said they believe it's important to accept the outcome of the election even if their preferred candidate loses. Roughly two months later, the number is 85%. Fewer Republican election deniers and fewer Democrats believe the same, with their numbers dropping from 43% to 42%, and 85% to 84%, respectively.\n\nIn July, 91% of Republicans who believe Biden won in 2020 said they believe it's important to accept the outcome of the election even if their preferred candidate loses. Roughly two months later, the number is 85%. Fewer Republican election deniers and fewer Democrats believe the same, with their numbers dropping from 43% to 42%, and 85% to 84%, respectively. Fewer people are anticipating political violence after the election. In July, 9% of respondents anticipated no violence after the election; by September, that number had risen to 11%. Additionally, respondents who think there will be \"a lot\" or \"great deal\" of violence after the election shrank from 22% in July to 20% in September.\n\n\"As we continue this panel research, we observed fairly small changes between our first wave in July and now, indicating a relatively stable electorate,\" Warren said. \"We'll be watching to see if there are any changes right before or after the election, when we launch our next panels.\"\n\nThe third poll will take place just prior to the November general election.\n\nJohns Hopkins University is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit institution that does not endorse or oppose any candidate for public office.",

        "text": "Three Ways AI Can Hack the U.S. Election\nIntroduction\n\nIn 2020, we covered Three Ways to Hack the U.S. Election. That article is every bit as relevant today as it was then. Four years ago, we focused on the ways in which disinformation could be used to misinform and divide the nation; the security community was still reacting to the 2018 official finding that Russian and Iranian intelligence operatives were found to be hacking political email systems to slant the news and sway voters. In 2024, the digital landscape has shifted again. The rapid proliferation of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and deepfakes pose an even more insidious threat. Today\u2019s disinformation campaigns are no longer limited to shadowy state-sponsored actors\u2014anyone with access to the right tools can now create convincing fake content, flooding the internet with false narratives. We explore the current and future threats to democratic voting systems posed by generative AI and why protocols like the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA) may not be enough to protect voters.\n\nThree Ways AI Can Hack Voters\n\nFrom fake videos and voice cloned audio to the rapid and widespread dissemination of fake news stories, we put forward the three most likely ways in which AI can and will be used to influence elections all over the world.\n\nDisinformation and Deepfakes\n\nTo date, discussions of election security have primarily focused on the technical and societal risks of electronic voting machines. In 2024, however, concerns of election interference should be focused on a much more fundamental issue: that of trust.\n\nIn recent years, disinformation has become a geopolitical weapon, and today it is easier than ever to create convincing fake content. Generative AI and other forms of machine learning are expanding their capabilities at an alarming rate. Early AI videos were comically bad (we only need look at the April 2023 video of Will Smith to be reminded of that). Less than a year after that spaghetti fuelled nightmare, OpenAI previewed \u2018Sora\u2019, their new tool for creating realistic and believable looking videos. Initial results from Sora had some flaws but could be believed to be real, at least to the casual observer. Today, AI manipulators can take real footage and effortlessly change entire aspects of video, for example by changing backgrounds or by perfectly modifying facial expressions to lip sync a person\u2019s mouth to deepfake audio. Updated 2024 versions of Will Smith eating spaghetti are shockingly realistic. Well, some are. There is still plenty of nightmare fuel out there.\n\nWith the proliferation of AI tools capable of generating deepfake videos, realistic images, and text that mimics legitimate news articles, the boundaries between real and fake have blurred. The content that gen AI creates, however, is not the first of its kind. Manipulated and fake images have been around at least since the dawn of photography with Hippolyte Bayard\u2019s \u201cSelf Portrait as a Drowned Man\u201d, and the Cottingley Fairies fooled even Arthur Conan Doyle in 1917., Of course, image manipulation software such as Adobe Photoshop have made these efforts easier. However, these tools require expert artists, expensive licenses, and hours (if not days) of time to create believable simulacrums. Generative AI tools almost entirely remove all of these barriers, allowing anyone, at no cost, to create realistic content within minutes.\n\nDuring the 2020 U.S. election period, nation-states engaged in cyber deception to divide, demoralize, distract, and discredit. They accomplished this using teams of operatives and automated bots, flooding social media with hand crafted faked content. Now, anyone with a computer and internet access can create realistic fake content that can go viral within hours.\n\nAs of today, generative AI is easily able to:\n\nCreate written content such as news articles, scientific looking reports, social media posts, etc.\n\nCreate photorealistic pictures which can look genuine\n\nSynthesize speech and sound effects, facilitating deepfake voices of real people\n\nCreate basic (though still impressive) video, capable of presenting realistic people delivering authentic sounding dialogue\n\nManipulate real video to replace or change elements\n\nThis is not a sensationalized prediction of things to come. Generative AI has already been weaponized. False claims of celebrity deaths have propagated across platforms often created by AI-powered news generators. NewsGuard\u2019s AI Tracking Center claims that the number of AI-generated news sites has gone from zero in early 2023, to over 1,100 by October 2024.",

The results are slightly outside the poll's margin of error, +/-2.5 percentage points.\n\nPollsters agreed that that the election will likely be decided by which campaign does the better job of turning out voters in the stretch leading up to Election Day. That is particularly true in the seven battleground states widely expected to decide the race for the White House.\n\nHere's what to know about presidential polling results on Sunday, October 27.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nABC: Harris is up \u2013 but the race is still tight\n\nWhile reporting that Harris has a 51%-47% advantage among likely voters nationally, ABC noted that the race is too close to call in the deciding states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada.\n\nThe race is also tighter among all registered voters, not just those likely to cast their ballots this year. Harris leads Trump 49%-47%, within the poll's margin of error.\n\nThe poll was conducted online from Oct. 18-22 in English and Spanish among 2,808 adults. It has a margin of sampling error +/- 2.5 percentage points for likely voters, +/- 2 percentage points for registered voters and +/-5.5 percentage points in swing states.\n\nEconomy, border most important for Republicans; Democrats say health care, democracy\n\nThe ABC News/Ipsos poll, like others, underscored how both campaigns are trying to put together coalitions based on specific issues.\n\nHarris has advantages with voters who support health care access and want to protect democracy; Trump scores well with voters who are concerned with the economy and immigration policy.\n\nAmong Democratic survey respondents registered to vote, 90% said health care was highly important to them, compared to 64% of Republicans. Additionally, 91% of Democrats said the same about \"protecting American democracy,\" compared to 80% of Republicans.\n\nOn the other side of the aisle, 96% of registered Republican voters surveyed said the economy was highly important to them, compared to 86% of Democrats. And and 90% of Republican survey respondents said the \"the immigration system at the U.S.-Mexico border\" was highly important, along with 50% of Democrats.\n\nCBS: Trump, Harris in a deadlock\n\nCBS found that Harris leads Trump by 1 percentage point nationally, and the two are tied 50%-50% in battlegrounds.\n\nThe outlet cited demographic factors, particularly what could wind up as a record-setting gender gap. By ten percentage points, women voters are more likely than men \"to say that only Kamala Harris has the mental and cognitive health to serve as president, and Trump does not.\"\n\nOverall, 55% of Democratic survey respondents who are likely to vote this fall said they're choosing Harris at the ballot box, compared to 45% of Democratic men surveyed. When it comes to Trump, 43% of Republican women said they're backing the former president, compared to 54% of GOP men.\n\nThe CBS/YouGov survey was conducted among 1,261 voters between Oct. 23-25. The margin of error is +/- 2.6 percentage points, and the swing states surveyed include Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nDecision 2024 is days away. Sign up for USA TODAY's On Politics newsletter for breaking news and expert analysis.\n\nThings to keep in mind about polling\n\nThe margin of error describes how accurately we can count on the survey results being representative of the entire population.\n\nWhen a candidate's lead is \"inside\" the margin of error, it is considered a \"statistical tie,\" according to Pew Research Center.\n\nPew has also found the majority of pollsters have changed their methods since the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections, where Trump's performance was significantly underestimated.\n\nContributing: Kinsey Crowley",

(AP Photo/Natacha Pisarenko)\n\nBoth of the leading candidates \u2014 a two-time mayor and former history teacher, Yamand\u00fa Orsi, 57, and the center-right ruling party\u2019s candidate, \u00c1lvaro Delgado, 55 \u2014 told crowds late Sunday that they would face each other in a heated runoff on Nov. 24, reflecting official election results with over 90% of votes counted hours after polls closed.\n\nThe outcome came as little surprise. But Uruguay\u2019s remarkably civilized presidential race has emerged as an exception in the region, defying trends of bitter division and democratic erosion seen across Latin America and in the United States. Far from mud-slinging and personal attacks, Uruguay\u2019s contest focused on key issues such as rising crime, pension reform and the quality of schools.\n\nUruguay\u2019s center-left Broad Front alliance went into the election as the front-runner, reflecting a desire for a stronger social safety net in one of Latin America\u2019s most expensive countries, where one in five children lives in poverty and an aging population has clamored for higher pensions.\n\nThe Broad Front held the presidency in Uruguay for 15 years, from 2005-2020, presiding over robust economic growth and socially liberal laws that raised the tiny country\u2019s global profile with the pioneering legalization of abortion, same-sex marriage and marijuana for recreational use.\n\nMost of that transformation occurred under the tenure of former President Jos\u00e9 \u201cPepe\u201d Mujica, an eccentric former guerrilla and present-day chrysanthemum farmer who has backed Orsi.\n\n\u201cWe are going in for these 27 days,\u201d Orsi told thousands of energized supporters waving flags and setting off flares in Montevideo late Sunday, referring to a final campaign push over the coming weeks. \u201cThe Broad Front is once again the most voted party in Uruguay.\u201d\n\nOrsi\u2019s working-class roots, casual wear and promise to eschew many of the benefits enjoyed by heads of state appears to draw inspiration from Mujica, now 89 and battling esophageal cancer.\n\n\u201cWe need to support democracy, not because it is perfect, but because humans have not yet invented anything better,\u201d Mujica told journalists after casting his ballot from a wheelchair.\n\nThe Broad Front has long taken a more moderate stance than other leftist governments in the region, such as in Venezuela and Bolivia. Orsi supports tax incentives to lure investors and as mayor sought to develop the country\u2019s nascent high-tech scene.\n\nDelgado \u2014 a buttoned-down former congressman who served as a senior aide to current President Luis Lacalle Pou \u2014 campaigned on pledges to continue the business-friendly policies of the president. Uruguay\u2019s constitution does not allow for re-election, but Lacalle Pou\u2019s approval ratings of some 50% have strengthened his party\u2019s candidate.\n\nIn stark contrast to recent electoral contests in neighboring Argentina and Brazil, where politically polarized electorates raged against the status quo, Delgado\u2019s campaign slogan was simply: \u201cRe-elect a good government.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople placed their trust in us,\u201d Delgado told supporters shortly after midnight. \u201cTomorrow we\u2019ll be meeting to plan the campaign for the runoff.\u201d\n\nDelgado was joined onstage by Uruguay\u2019s most unconventional candidate, Andr\u00e9s Ojeda, 40, a muscular, media-savvy lawyer with a penchant for adopting dogs and discussing star signs. Ojeda placed in a distant third but secured surprisingly strong support, taking nearly 17% of the vote.\n\nHe sought to spice up what some political commentators have scorned as one of the world\u2019s dullest elections, energizing apathetic young voters with splashy ads that show him lifting weights in tight undershirts at the gym.\n\n\u201cThe government cannot be won without us,\u201d Ojeda said at the election night rally alongside Delgado, a sign of his intention to back the governing party to block a possible Broad Front victory.\n\nPreliminary results reported by electoral authorities showed Orsi leading with over 41% of the vote, compared with just over 27% for Delgado. From the moment exit polls surfaced, it was clear that Orsi would fall short of the 50% threshold needed to avoid a runoff on Nov. 24, reflecting voter apathy in the race between rivals whose talking points often overlap.\n\nElectoral officials reported a turnout of 89% of 2.7 million eligible voters in Uruguay, widely considered a model democracy where voting in presidential and congressional contests is compulsory.\n\nMore divisive than the race itself Sunday was a constitutional referendum that would have overhauled Uruguay\u2019s social security system by lowering the retirement age, boosting minimum payouts and transferring Uruguayans\u2019 privately managed savings to a government-run trust.\n\nThere was a general sigh of relief as exit polls showed that Uruguayans rejected the radical scheme that would have massively expanded the country\u2019s fiscal deficit.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s reassuring for many, especially investors, that the pension issue wasn\u2019t approved,\u201d said Juan Cruz D\u00edaz, a political analyst who runs the Cefeidas consultancy group in Buenos Aires.\n\nWith rising homicides and robberies a top voter concern in the nation traditionally considered one of the safest in Latin America, Uruguayans voted on another constitutional reform that would have allowed police to search homes at night with a court order. Exit polls suggested that the referendum would also come up short of the absolute majority needed to pass.\n\nDespite Orsi\u2019s lead in Sunday\u2019s vote, experts cautioned the final outcome was far from certain, with the governing coalition expected to enjoy a surge in support during the final stretch.\n\n\u201cTomorrow begins a new, focused campaign,\u201d Cruz D\u00edaz said. \u201cIt\u2019s not over yet.\u201d\n\n___\n\nDeBre reported from Buenos Aires, Argentina",

        "text": "Foreign threats to the US election are on the rise, and officials are moving faster to expose them\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A presidential candidate\u2019s phone is hacked. A fake video falsely shows ballots burned in Pennsylvania. National security officials warn that U.S. adversaries may incite violent protests after Election Day.\n\nThese developments \u2014 all revealed in the past week \u2014 show how Russia, China and Iran have increased the pace of efforts to meddle in American politics ahead of next month\u2019s election, just as intelligence officials and security analysts had predicted.\n\nAt the same time, officials, tech companies and private researchers have adopted a more aggressive defense by swiftly exposing foreign election threats, highlighting the lessons learned from past election cycles that revealed America\u2019s vulnerability to disinformation and cyberespionage.\n\nOfficials say the U.S. election system is so secure that no foreign nation could alter the results at a scale necessary to change the outcome. Nevertheless, authoritarian adversaries have leveraged disinformation and cyberespionage to target campaigns and voters while stoking distrust and discord.\n\nHere\u2019s what to know as the presidential election approaches:\n\nWhat to know about Trump\u2019s second term:\n\nStaffing the administration: Here are the people Trump has picked recess appointments Follow all of our coverage as Donald Trump assembles his second administration.\n\nRussia is the top threat\n\nRussia is the most active and sophisticated nation working to manipulate the U.S. election, using fake websites, state-controlled media and unwitting Americans to spread misleading and polarizing content aimed at undermining confidence in elections.\n\nThe Kremlin\u2019s disinformation apparatus seizes on contentious issues like immigration, crime, the economy or disaster relief. The goal is to weaken the U.S., erode support for Ukraine as it fights off Russian invaders and reduce America\u2019s ability to counter Russia\u2019s growing ties to China, North Korea and Iran, officials have said.\n\nIntelligence officials and private security analysts have determined that Russia supports former President Donald Trump, and is using disinformation \u2014 sometimes AI-generated \u2014 to smear his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin, suggested cutting funds to Ukraine and repeatedly criticized the NATO military alliance.\n\nIn one particularly audacious campaign, Russia staged a video that falsely accused Harris of paralyzing a woman in a car crash years ago. Another video made fictitious allegations against Harris\u2019 running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.\n\nOn Friday, the FBI confirmed Moscow\u2019s role in creating a third video supposedly showing the destruction of mail ballots in Pennsylvania. Local election officials quickly debunked the video as false.\n\nRussia also has tried to pay American influencers who spread the Kremlin\u2019s preferred narratives. Last month, U.S. authorities accused two Russian state media employees of funneling $10 million to a Tennessee company to create pro-Russian content. The company then paid several popular right-wing influencers, who have said they had no idea their work was being supported by Russia.\n\nMoscow\u2019s campaign won\u2019t end on Election Day. Instead, intelligence officials and private security analysts predict Russia will exploit claims of election irregularities to suggest the results can\u2019t be trusted. A recently declassified intelligence memo said Russia may also encourage violent protests after the election.\n\n\u201cPutin\u2019s aim is to foment chaos, division and polarization in our society,\u201d said Michael McFaul, a former U.S. ambassador to Russia who now teaches at Stanford University.\n\nRussia has rejected claims that it seeks to influence the U.S. election. A message left with Russia\u2019s embassy in Washington was not immediately returned Saturday.\n\nIranian hack-and-leak operations\n\nIran has been a particularly brazen player in foreign interference this year.\n\nIt\u2019s accused of hacking Trump campaign associates and offering the stolen communications to media organizations and Democrats in hopes that damaging stories would emerge that could hurt the Republican\u2019s prospects. Emails dangling dirt were sent to people associated with President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign, but there\u2019s no indication anyone replied, officials have said.\n\nThe Justice Department last month charged three Iranian hackers who remain at large, accusing them of a yearslong operation targeting a vast array of victims.\n\nU.S. officials have described the hacking as part of a broader effort to interfere in an election that Iran perceives as particularly consequential. Iran, they say, has made clear its opposition to the Trump campaign. His administration ended a nuclear deal with Iran, reimposed sanctions and ordered the killing of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, an act prompting Iran\u2019s leaders to vow revenge.\n\nIn addition to the cyberoperations, U.S. officials have repeatedly expressed concern about the potential for Iran to carry out violence on U.S. soil against Trump or other members of his administration. Officials in 2022 brought charges in a foiled Iranian plot to kill Trump\u2019s national security adviser, John Bolton, and this year charged a Pakistani man with ties to Iran in a plot to carry out political assassinations in the U.S., including potentially of Trump.\n\nLeaders in Tehran also may try to encourage violent protests after the election, according to the declassified intelligence memo. Authorities say Iran also covertly funded and supported protests in the U.S. over Israel\u2019s war in Gaza.\n\nIranian authorities have dismissed allegations that the country is seeking to influence the election. Iran\u2019s mission to the United Nations released a statement this week saying, \u201cIran neither has any motive nor intent to interfere in the U.S. election.\u201d\n\nA neutral China?\n\nU.S. intelligence officials believe China is taking a more neutral stance in the election and is focused on down-ballot races, targeting candidates from both parties based on their positions on issues of key importance to Beijing, including support for Taiwan.\n\nBut the Chinese government has for years operated a sophisticated hacking operation targeting all manners of Western life and industry that goes well beyond election influence.\n\n\u201cFrom city council to president, they want access,\u201d said Adam Darrah, a former CIA political analyst who is now vice president of intelligence at the cybersecurity firm ZeroFox, which tracks foreign online threats.\n\nOn Friday, news broke that Chinese hackers as part of a much broader espionage effort had targeted cellphones used by Trump, his running mate JD Vance and people associated with Harris\u2019 campaign. It was not immediately clear what data, if any, had been accessed.\n\nA spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington said they were unfamiliar with the details and couldn\u2019t comment but contended that China is routinely victimized by cyberattacks and opposes the activity.\n\nAre these tactics new?\n\nHardly. Foreign adversaries, including the same ones blamed for meddling now, have sought to interfere in the last several election cycles \u2014 with varying degrees of success.\n\nBut the U.S. government, blamed for sitting on information about the scope of Russian interference in the 2016 election, has worked this year to aggressively call out foreign threats as part of an effort to reduce their impact and assure Americans that the election is secure.\n\nIn 2016, Russian military intelligence officers hacked into the email accounts of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman and the Democratic Party and released tens of thousands of communications in an effort to boost Trump\u2019s successful presidential campaign.\n\nRussia also engaged that year in a huge but hidden social media trolling campaign aimed at sowing discord on hot-button social issues, creating division in the American electoral process and harming Clinton\u2019s bid for president.\n\nThe antics continued in the 2020 election cycle when a Ukrainian lawmaker described at the time by U.S. officials as an \u201cactive Russian agent \u201d released audio recordings of Democrat Joe Biden, who was then running for president.\n\nThat same year, Iranian hackers were blamed for emails purported to come from the far-right group The Proud Boys that officials said were designed to harm Trump\u2019s candidacy.",

        "text": "Can Puerto Ricans vote for US president in 2024? See how many live in Texas\nPuerto Rico residents outraged by the remarks a conservative comedian made about the island nation during a Sunday rally for Donald Trump at Madison Square Garden won't be able to make their displeasure known at the polls. But it could still impact the presidential race as both candidates vie for Latino voters to help get them to the White House.\n\nComedian Tony Hinchcliffe, who goes by the stage name Kill Tony, took the stage ahead of Trump during the presidential candidate's hometown campaignrally, where he derided Puerto Rico as a \u201cfloating island of garbage.\u201d\n\nThe remarks, which drew condemnation from both sides of the political aisle, sent the Trump campaign into damage control,and his campaign sought to distance Trump from the comments.\n\nHere's what to know about Puerto Rico's role in the Nov. 5 election.\n\nPeople are also reading:Who is Tony Hinchcliffe? Bad Bunny endorses Harris after comedian's Trump rally set\n\nDoes Puerto Rico vote for president in 2024?\n\nMore than two-thirds of Puerto Ricans live in the United States \u2014 roughly 5.8 million, according to Pew Research Center. Puerto Rican voters living in the U.S. make up the second-largest Latino group in the country, including in key battleground states like Pennsylvania.\n\nBut while an additional 3.3 million Puerto Ricans live on the island, a U.S. territory, they won't be able to vote for president.\n\nResidents of the other four U.S. territories (American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands and the U.S. Virgin Islands) also do not have the right to vote in general elections.\n\nThe District of Columbia (a.k.a. Washington, D.C.) is the only jurisdiction outside the 50 states whose residents can vote for the president. It has three electoral votes.\n\nHow does Puerto Rico vote for president?\n\nEven though those living in Puerto Rico cannot vote in the Nov. 5 election, or any other presidential election, they are able to help choose each party's nominee for president in the primary selection process.\n\nTrump, who is seeing increased support among Latino men and has touted endorsements from Puerto Rican artists like Anuel AA and Nicky Jam, won Puerto Rico's 2024 GOP primary, winning 23 of the territory's Republican delegates. All 55 of its Democratic delegates voted for Joe Biden.\n\nDuring Trump\u2019s presidency, Puerto Rico was devastated by two back-to-back hurricanes in 2017 that killed more than 3,000 people and displaced thousands. At the time, Trump was criticized for his response to the storms after he downplayed the damage they caused, and an image went viral of him throwing rolls of paper towels to residents on the island.\n\nPuerto Rico faces a gubernatorial election this November where the New Progressive Party has the lead.\n\nPuerto Rican celebrities respond\n\nHinchcliffe spoke at Trump\u2019s rally at Madison Square Garden several hours before the former president in an opening act.\n\nHis remarks drew widespread criticism from Democrats, fellow Republicans, and major celebrities, even amid the Trump campaign's efforts to distance itself from the comedian.\n\nSenior Trump advisor Danielle Alvarez issued a statement on Sunday night, saying, \u201cThis joke does not reflect the views of President Trump or the campaign.\"\n\nPuerto Rican celebrities, including Grammy-winning artists Bad Bunny, Jennifer Lopez and Ricky Martin condemned Hinchcliffe's comments. Bad Bunny took to his Instagram, where he has 45.6 million followers, to share a video of Harris criticizing Trump\u2019s actions against Puerto Rico when he was president and outlining her own agenda for the island.\n\nDemocratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz and New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, doing live coverage of the rally, also criticized Hinchcliffe and urged Puerto Ricans who live in Pennsylvania to watch the remarks for themselves.\n\nHow many Puerto Ricans live in Texas?\n\nRoughly 5.8 million Puerto Ricans live in the U.S., and nearly 1% of that group lives in Texas. Texas has one of the largest Latino populations among the states, second only to California. In 2022, about 12.1 million Latinos lived in the Lone Star State, accounting for around 40% of its population, according to Pew Research Center.\n\nIn 2018, the U.S. Census Bureau reported 213,809 Puerto Ricans lived in Texas, making up 0.74% of the country's Puerto Rican population.\n\nIs Puerto Rico part of the US?\n\nAs an unincorporated territory of the United States, Puerto Rico is neither an independent country nor U.S. state.\n\n\u2014 USA TODAY contributed to this report.",

        "text": "US Election 2024 Live Updates: Thousands of MAGA die-hards flood Trump's Madison Square Garden rally\n14:03 (IST) Oct 26\n\nThe US political scene is intensifying as the November 5 presidential election nears. American voters will choose their 47th president, with Republican Donald Trump facing Democrat Kamala Harris.\n\n\n\n\u200b\u200b\u200bTrump, a former President, will compete against the current vice president Harris. President Joe Biden initially entered the race but stepped down due to health issues, endorsing Harris and potentially leading to the US electing its first female President.\n\n\n\nEarly voting has increased, with 47 states and the District of Columbia offering the option. In Mississippi, Alabama, and New Hampshire, mail-in ballots are limited, but some exceptions apply. Around 25 million Americans have already participated in early voting.\n\n\n\nIf elected, Harris would become the fifth sitting vice president and seventh overall to secure the presidency. She made history as the first woman, African American, and person of South Asian descent to become Vice President. Notably, 15 vice presidents have eventually become Presidents, including Biden.\n\n\n\nCharles Curtis was the first non-white vice president with Native American and European ancestry. Barack Obama and Harris are the only other non-whites to hold top US offices, though it\u2019s suggested some white presidents had partial black ancestry.\n\n\n\nUS elections occur on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November, a rule established in 1845. This timing avoided conflicts with market days and religious observances.\n\n\n\nRepublicans are symbolized by the elephant, and Democrats by the donkey, popularized by cartoonist Thomas Nast in the 1870s.\n\n\n\nBeyond Harris and Trump, third-party candidates like Green Party\u2019s Jill Stein, Libertarian Chase Oliver, and independents Cornel West and Robert F Kennedy Jr are also in the race. While Kennedy has endorsed Trump, he remains on the ballot in some states, potentially affecting Trump\u2019s vote count.\n\n",

The cost of living, rising sea level and relations with China were the main issues leading up to Friday\u2019s presidential election.\n\nSaturday\u2019s outcome is viewed as the Kiribati voters\u2019 endorsement of policies Maamau\u2019s government has implemented over the last four years, including deepening the Pacific Island nation\u2019s ties with China.\n\nDuring the parliamentary election in August, the ruling Tobwaan Kiribati Party, or TKP, secured 33 out of 44 seats in the new parliament, and Maamau won his seat by winning close to 83% of the votes in his district.\n\n\u201cThe TKP has a very healthy majority [in the parliament], and it sort of shows that the people of Kiribati want to see more of what has been happening [over the last few years],\u201d said Henryk Szadziewski, an expert on Pacific-China relations at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.\n\nSince switching diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China in 2019, Kiribati has deepened its engagement with Beijing. The Maamau administration\u2019s efforts to elevate security ties with the Chinese government have prompted concerns from partners such as Australia and the United States.\n\nIn 2021, China helped Kiribati revamp a World War II-era airstrip on the island of Kanton, which is less than 3,000 kilometers from Hawaii and Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands, where major U.S. military bases are located.\n\nIn February, Kiribati\u2019s acting police commissioner, Eeri Aritiera, revealed that Chinese police would help Kiribati\u2019s community policing program and IT department, raising concerns from the U.S. that the cooperation could negatively impact Kiribati\u2019s sovereignty.\n\nSome analysts say since China has ambitions to deepen its economic and security reach in the Pacific region, Australia and the United States are very concerned about any advancement in security relations between Beijing and Pacific Island countries.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unclear how the policing arrangement with Kiribati will evolve in Maamou\u2019s next term, but it\u2019s unlikely that Chinese engagement will cease or decrease,\u201d said Meg Keen, a senior fellow at Lowy Institute in Australia.\n\nDespite these concerns, Szadziewski said Kiribati\u2019s efforts to build closer ties with China shouldn\u2019t be viewed through a pure zero-sum lens. \u201cThe Kiribati economy is heavily reliant on tourism and fishing, and China has stepped up with infrastructure projects in that respect,\u201d he told VOA by phone.\n\nBut China\u2019s engagement with Kiribati hasn\u2019t been \u201call benevolence,\u201d Szadziewski said. \u201cKiribati has opened up its maritime domain for increased Chinese fishing, so there is something in it for China that\u2019s economic,\u201d he said.\n\nDuring a reception celebrating the fifth anniversary of the restoration of diplomatic ties between China and Kiribati, the Chinese ambassador to Kiribati, Zhou Limin, said the relationship has further consolidated and vowed to strengthen synergy between the two countries in the future.\n\nUnder Maamau\u2019s third term, Keen in Australia said, Kiribati will likely maintain its close relationship with China while also trying to seek assistance from other countries, such as Australia, to help improve the country\u2019s infrastructure and climate resilience.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no indication that the relationship with China will change under another term for Maamau, and he will be seeking a strong legacy in his final term by working with any development partner that can assist with his ambitious development goals,\u201d Keen told VOA in a written response.\n\nShe added that most Pacific leaders don\u2019t view maintaining relations with China or other democratic countries such as Australia as \u201can either/or choice.\u201d\n\nIn response to China\u2019s elevated relations with Kiribati, Australia and the United States have also stepped up efforts to deepen ties with the Pacific Islands nation.\n\nIn 2023, Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong announced that Canberra would \u201crapidly scale up\u201d security and development with Kiribati during her visit to the country. In February, the U.S. Coast Guard conducted joint patrols with Kiribati in the country\u2019s exclusive economic zone.\n\nDespite these efforts, Szadziewski at the University of Hawaii said it\u2019s important for democratic countries to understand the priorities of Pacific Island countries and try to engage with them on \u201cequal footing.\u201d\n\n\u201cPacific Island states have heightened sensitivity about sovereignty, so they prefer to see exchanges with other states on an equal footing,\u201d he told VOA, adding that democratic countries should ensure the priority of their engagement with Pacific Island countries is not solely about geopolitics.\n\n\u201cIf China is your main concern and why you are in the region, that\u2019s not going to be something of interest to the Pacific Island leaders,\u201d Szadziewski said.\n\nIn addition to the presidential election in Kiribati, Palau is going to hold a general election on November 5, with the current president, Surangel Whipps Jr., running against former president Tommy Remengesau Jr. in a race that analysts say Beijing will be closely following.\n\nExperts say competition for geopolitical influence between China and the U.S. as well as its allies will intensify as countries try to engage with winners emerging from these important elections in the Pacific region.\n\n\u201cElection periods will always heighten activities, and competition [between these countries] is only going to get more intense over the next couple of years,\u201d Blake Johnson, a senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, told VOA by phone.",

        "text": "When will we know if Kamala Harris or Donald Trump won the 2024 presidential election?\nElection Day is quickly approaching and millions of people will be heading to the poll to cast their votes.\n\nOnce the polls close on Election Day, the question becomes when will we find out who won?\n\nHow long does it take a candidate to concede the presidential race?\n\nTypically, the wait isn't that long. In 1896, William Jennings Bryant needed two days before conceding the election to President William McKinley. Since then, most candidates have conceded either the same day or the next day with two exceptions \u2013 2000 and 2020.\n\n2000 presidential election\n\nIn 2000, the presidential race between Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush came down to Florida. The Sunshine State had voting issues with hanging chads and allegations of misconduct. The case went to the Supreme Court, which ruled in Bush's favor. In all, it took 36 days before Gore conceded the election.\n\n2020 presidential election\n\nIn 2020, then-former Vice President Joe Biden defeated President Donald Trump, but it took four days for a winner to be declared. Trump posted on social media \"He Won\" referring to Biden on Nov. 15, 2020, and said he wasn't serving another term on Jan. 7, 2021 \u2013 a day after a riot on Capitol Hill. Trump never conceded the election.\n\nWhen is Election Day 2024?\n\nElection Day is Tuesday, Nov. 5.\n\nHow long will we wait for a presidential election winner?\n\nSince the last presidential election in 2020, many of the sweeping election laws and voting access changes made in response to the coronavirus pandemic have faced polarized legislatures and become a source of division.\n\nNow, voters in crucial states like North Carolina face the aftermath of the devastating Hurricane Helene.\n\nOther key swing states that Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are vying for, like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, aren't permitted to start processing absentee and mail-in ballots until Election Day, which is expected to slow down the count.\n\nBetween the expected tightness of the race and the time it takes to count all the ballots, it's going to take some time before a winner is determined.\n\nIs Trump or Harris leading the presidential polls\n\nHeading into the final weeks before Election Day, Harris and Trump are tied, according to an exclusive USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll.\n\nThe survey puts Harris at 45%, Trump at 44%, a closer race than the poll found in August. Then, in the wake of the Democratic National Convention, Harris led Trump by 5 percentage points, 48% to 43%. The poll of 1,000 likely voters, taken by landline and cellphone Oct. 14-18, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.\n\nOther presidential race indicators\n\nAllan Lichtman, the historian renowned for accurately predicting 9 out of the 10 most recent presidential elections, has shared his prediction for this year's White House race. He forecasts that Harris will win. In a video first reported by the New York Times, Lichtman explained that his prediction is based on a set of thirteen \"keys\" or true-false questions assessing the strength and performance of the incumbent party in the White House.\n\nHarris and Trump are neck-and-neck in the 2024 race for the White House. In a Real Clear Politics average of national polls, Harris leads Trump by 0.2 percentage points. The two are in a dead heat in each battleground state.\n\nGambling lines are in Trump's favor. As of Oct. 18, Trump's probability of winning topped 61% on Polymarket, a crypto trading platform, for the first time since Biden dropped out of the race. Betfair Exchange, the biggest U.K. peer-to-peer betting platform, predicted on its temperature gauge Thursday morning that Trump would likely win.

The focus later shifts to January 20, when Harris or Trump will be sworn-in as the 47th President of the United States.January 20 marks the day when the US president and the vice-president are inaugurated for a four-year term. But until 1933, presidential inaugurations were held on March 4, the day when the US Constitution came into effect in 1789.The Inauguration Day was pushed forward to January 20 after the 20th Amendment to the US Constitution. Introduced by Nebraska Senator George Norris, the amendment came into effect in October 1933.Franklin D Roosevelt was not only the last President to be inaugurated on March 4, but also the first to take the oath of office on January 20.The US federal law states that the presidential election will be held on the first Tuesday of November.In the pre-modern United States, November was the \u201cgoldilocks\u201d period between the harvest season and the harsh winter. Moreover, Tuesday was chosen to help people attend church on Sunday, travel to the polling station on Monday, and vote before farmers sold their produce on Wednesday.The four-month gap between Election Day and the presidential inauguration gave enough time to the president-elect and his Cabinet members to complete their pending work before travelling to Washington DC. This system worked more-or-less smoothly in the 19th Century when access to communication and transportation was difficult.But things changed rapidly after the Civil War. Aided by technological innovations, the United States turned into one of the richest nations in the world. Two Ts \u2013 Telegram & Telephone \u2013 and two Rs \u2013 Roadways and Railways \u2013 not only united the vast country but also eased political transitions.Norris began his decade-long quest to reduce the four-month gap in the early 1920s. By then, the long transition period fostered lame-duck presidencies, wherein the incumbent continued to govern even after losing the people\u2019s mandate.Things reached a tipping point when President Warren Harding attempted to push a bill regarding the US merchant marine program, even after losing the 1922 elections.The dangers of the 'lame-duck period' came to the fore during the Great Depression. Roosevelt won the 1932 elections, promising to bring the American economy back on track. But the long transition delayed his \u2018New Deal\u2019 reforms.The transition period is still long \u2013 over 10 weeks. However, the complex process has become more efficient in the last few decades.Interestingly, the 20th Amendment is the least controversial of them all. It has never been involved in a Supreme Court case, showing the bi-partisan impact of this amendment on the country\u2019s politics.",

In the 11th report of an in-depth series , Khushboo Razdan looks at why India is keeping a close eye on the contest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith the US poised to elect its 47th president in 10 days, Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman arrived in New York on Monday, making her the fifth senior official from New Delhi to visit the US in just over two months.\n\nSitharaman, touring in the US through Saturday to promote investments in India, also travelled to Washington to engage with heads of financial institutions and policymakers.\n\nShe followed Indian Industry and Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal, who met US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and Trade Representative Katherine Tai this month to discuss countering Beijing\u2019s influence as a global manufacturing hub as well as a potential bilateral free trade agreement on critical minerals.\n\nGoyal also noted the frequency of Indian officials\u2019 trips to the US to engage with their counterparts ahead of the election, including Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoyal added that he was \u201cvery confident\u201d the relationship between the \u201ctwo democracies of significance\u201d would deepen, since it had already \u201cstood the test of time\u201d under the US presidencies of Donald Trump and Joe Biden.\n\nOnce a hesitant global player, New Delhi has in recent years stepped onto the world stage as a burgeoning economic power, bolstering its partnership with Washington and its allies to counter Beijing\u2019s influence. India\u2019s economy is expected to rise from fifth-largest internationally to third by 2030. The country also boasts a big diaspora in the US, with Indians the largest group of Asian-American voters, at over two million.",

        "text": "Why the candidate with the most votes may not become the next US president\nThe high-stakes race for the White House is entering its final days.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut regardless of whether the current United States vice president and Democratic candidate Kamala Harris or former president and Republican candidate Donald Trump wins the national popular vote, it doesn't necessarily mean they will become president.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's because the US has an indirect democracy, meaning voters don't directly elect the president.\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead, a system called the Electoral College is used to determine the newest occupant of the Oval Office.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere's how it works and why it's contentious.\n\n\n\nWhat is the Electoral College and how does it work?\n\nThe Electoral College was established in the US constitution as a compromise between a vote in Congress and a popular vote by citizens.\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery four years, a temporary group of electors is created \u2014 and it's technically these people, not the American public, who vote for the president.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are 538 electors in total. For a candidate to win the presidency, they need a majority of at least 270 electoral votes.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe number of electors allocated to each state is equal to the number of senators and congressional districts they have. For Electoral College purposes, the District of Columbia is treated like a state.\n\n\n\nThere are 538 electors in total, divided among the states. Source: SBS News The minimum number of electors each state is guaranteed is three, regardless of how small their population is.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat means that an electoral vote in one state can be representative of the will of fewer people than in another, raising questions about the fairness of the system.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, California gets 54 electors for its 39.5 million residents, which works out to over 730,000 people per vote.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy comparison, just over 576,000 live in Wyoming, meaning each of its three electoral votes represents around 192,000 people.\n\n\n\nMost states, as well as the District of Columbia, have a \"winner-takes-all\" approach.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, if Trump wins the statewide popular vote in Florida, regardless of how slim the margin is, he'll receive all 30 of its electoral votes. Harris would receive none, even if she secured just 0.01 per cent less of the state's popular vote.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe outliers are Maine and Nebraska, which use a proportional allocation system.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey each award two electoral votes based on the statewide popular votes, as well as one vote for each of their congressional districts. While rare, it can result in a split vote, as happened in both states in 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, if Harris wins the popular vote in Maine as well as one congressional district, she will receive three electoral votes. If Trump gets a majority in the other congressional district, he will receive one electoral vote.\n\n\n\nThe Electoral College system is used to determine the US president. Source: SBS News\n\nSo, the candidate with the most votes may not win the election?\n\nYes \u2014 the way the Electoral College process works means a candidate can win the national popular vote, but not secure enough electoral votes to become president.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis has happened five times.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most recent example was in 2016 when Hillary Clinton won 48.2 per cent of the national vote but only secured 227 Electoral College votes \u2014 well short of the 270 needed to become president.\n\n\n\n\n\nConversely, Trump only won 46.1 per cent of the national vote but was elected president because he received 304 Electoral College votes.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat was primarily due to him winning the swing states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin.\n\n\n\nBruce Wolpe, a senior fellow at the University of Sydney's United States Studies Centre, told SBS News that more Americans were becoming aware of how \"undemocratic\" the Electoral College system could be.\n\n\n\n\n\nThose living in historically safe states like Alabama can often feel like their vote \"doesn't matter\", he said, particularly when they don't support the party that usually wins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think people can get very cynical about it in that we're called 'the greatest democracy' but our democratic institutions don't reflect the will of the people,\" Wolpe said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think that is a real infirmity in American democracy.\"\n\n\n\nA fragile system \u2014 and recent changes\n\nWhile we may have an idea of how many electoral votes each candidate has won on election night and, therefore, who will become the next president, it's not official until the votes are certified.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce each state has certified their winner of the popular vote and the electors have been selected based on that result, they then cast their votes for president.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe electors are expected to vote for the winner of the popular vote in their state (or in the case of two of Nebraska and Maine's electors, the winner of each congressional district), but it's not a legal requirement everywhere.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere were seven \"faithless electors\" in the 2016 election, three of whom voted for former US secretary of state Colin Powell, who wasn't even a presidential candidate at the time.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO America's great immigration debate: what are both sides saying? SBS News 20/10/2024 15:07 Play\n\nThe last step of the certification process happens on 6 January, when a joint session of Congress is held to formally count the votes.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is where things became unstuck following the 2020 election.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite Joe Biden winning the national popular vote and securing an Electoral College majority , Trump refused to accept he'd lost and tried to overturn the results.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe former president and his allies made false claims of widespread voter fraud , which a Congressional panel found had directly influenced the 6 January riots, where a mob of Trump supporters violently stormed the Capitol building to try to disrupt the certification of the election result .\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to four criminal charges accusing him of a conspiracy to obstruct the congressional certification of the election, defraud the US out of accurate results and interfere with Americans\u2019 voting rights.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt a recent town hall event, Trump said 6 January was a \"day of love\". Speaking with Bloomberg News, he doubled down, saying the primary scene in Washington was \"hundreds of thousands, the largest group of people I've ever spoken before ... and it was love and peace\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Some people went to the Capitol, and a lot of strange things happened,\" Trump said.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Why the war of words in US politics hits harder than in Australia\n\nSome Republicans in a joint session of Congress also tried to dispute the Electoral College results in certain states.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile these efforts failed, they shone a light on one of the US electoral system's vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2022, Congress amended the law that governs how it certifies presidential elections, clarifying who has the power to appoint electors and making it much harder to reject electoral votes.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow rigorously these reforms will be tested in the 2024 election remains to be seen.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith additional reporting by Sam Dover and the Reuters news agency.\n\n\n\n\n\nWant more politics?

        "text": "These swing-state counties are key to understanding the presidential race\nThese swing-state counties are key to understanding the presidential race\n\nIn the 2020 presidential election, the country was stretched ideologically and demographically. From 2012 to 2016, more than 200 counties flipped from former President Barack Obama to former President Donald Trump. In 2020, less than half that number changed hands from Trump to President Biden.\n\nBiden won by bigger margins in cities, and Trump drove up turnout and margins in rural areas. Biden was able to win because of his strength in the suburbs and the shift of white voters with college degrees toward the Democratic Party in the Trump era \u2014 something Vice President Harris wants to try to replicate.\n\nBut there\u2019s no guarantee that will happen again, especially as Trump has made efforts to peel off portions of traditionally Democratic groups, like young men, young Black men and working-class Latinos.\n\nBelow is a guide to the counties to keep an eye on in each of the seven swing states as returns roll in on election night and in the days afterward. These counties will help explain why the next president won. (Source for county vote data comes from the U.S. Election Atlas .)\n\nJump to a state: Pennsylvania | Wisconsin | Michigan | North Carolina | Georgia | Arizona | Nevada\n\nPennsylvania\n\n19 electoral votes\n\n2020 margin: D+1.18 (82,166 votes)\n\n1. Montgomery: The most populous Philadelphia suburban county, Biden netted 40,000 more votes there in 2020 than Hillary Clinton did in 2016. Harris has to try to match that in order to win this important state. Biden saw a 120,000-vote shift statewide in his favor \u2014 105,000 of that came from just the four suburban Philadelphia counties (Montgomery, Bucks, Delaware and Chester), which are among the highest educated, wealthiest and most populated counties in the state. Though they voted overwhelmingly for Biden in 2020, Trump can\u2019t ignore them because he\u2019s expected to get a significant share of votes from them, too. Harris would also like to do at least as well as Biden did in Philadelphia proper, where Democrats have seen a slight decline in their vote share since Obama was on the ballot (85% in 2012, 82% in 2016 and 81% in 2020).\n\nSponsor Message\n\n2. Allegheny (and surrounding area): Biden won this county, where Pittsburgh is, in 2020. He netted nearly 40,000 more votes out of Allegheny than Clinton did four years earlier. Harris will need to try to replicate Biden\u2019s performance because in all the counties that touch Allegheny, including Butler where Trump was shot, Trump won handily.\n\n3. Cumberland: Trump won this central Pennsylvania county with 55%. It\u2019s a mix of suburban and rural and sits just across the river from the state capital of Harrisburg. Biden was able to cut into Trump\u2019s margins, netting 7,000 more votes than Clinton pulled from Trump in 2016. Biden\u2019s 44% in the county in 2020 was the best for a Democrat since 1964. Cumberland has seen a 15% population increase since 2010, has the highest median income outside the Philadelphia collar counties and the seventh-highest college attainment of any county in the state. It\u2019s the county with the highest level of college attainment that went Republican.\n\n4. Lackawanna: It\u2019s home to Scranton in the northeastern part of the state. Biden was born there and won it by more than Clinton in 2016. But it has been trending away from Democrats in the age of Trump due, in part, to its high blue-collar population.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n5. Cambria: This populated, more rural county in the central western part of the state could give some clues about similar places that are crucial to Trump\u2019s support and turnout level with his base. It\u2019s 90% white and below the national average for college attainment and income. Like other more rural counties, it went by more for Trump in 2020 than 2016, despite him losing the state overall.\n\nBoomerang counties*: Erie, Northampton\n\n* Boomerang counties refer to places that went for Obama twice, Trump in 2016 and Biden in 2020.\n\nWisconsin\n\n10 electoral votes\n\n2020 margin: D+0.63 (20,682 votes)\n\n1. Dane (Madison): This heavily Democratic county, home to Madison and the University of Wisconsin, has seen tremendous growth in the past decade. It accounted for 1 in 6 Democratic votes statewide in 2020, but 80% of the total vote-shift in Biden's favor.\n\n2. Milwaukee: For Harris to repeat a Democratic win in the state, she\u2019s going to have to drive up turnout in this county. It is the most populous county in the state, is 27% Black, 17% Latino and 5% Asian American. It\u2019s also a critical place for Trump. Milwaukee County gave Trump his second highest vote total of any county outside Waukesha in the Milwaukee suburbs.\n\n3. Waukesha: There are 72 counties in Wisconsin, and nearly 10% of all the votes cast for Trump in 2020 came from this one suburban county just west of Milwaukee. A lot is made of the fact that Trump\u2019s margins of victory were significantly smaller in the \u201cWOW\u201d counties (Waukesha, Ozaukee and Washington) surrounding Milwaukee in 2020. That was largely the result of far fewer third-party votes pulling from Democrats that year. Trump got nearly the identical percentages in each of the three WOW counties in both 2016 and 2020. The four suburban counties that touch Milwaukee \u2014 the WOW counties plus Racine \u2014 accounted for 1 in 5 Trump votes statewide. Harris probably has to do at least as well as Biden in these suburbs to win the state.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n4. La Crosse: Clinton got a bare majority in this western Wisconsin county, but Biden expanded the margin here. It could be a sign of how the state goes and how Harris performs with blue-collar white voters \u2014 it\u2019s nearly 90% white \u2014 and with younger voters. The city of La Crosse within the county is home to three colleges and thousands of students.\n\n5. Brown (Green Bay): Welcome to Packers Country. In fairness, the entire state is Packers Country, but Brown County is home to Green Bay. This county leans Republican, but Biden cut the margins here \u2014 again, mostly because of fewer people voting third party in 2020. Harris can\u2019t afford to get blown out here or in neighboring Outagamie. It also has one of the higher Latino populations in the state.\n\nBoomerang: Door, Sauk\n\nMichigan\n\n15 electoral votes\n\n2020 margin: D+2.78 (154,181 votes)\n\n1. Wayne (Detroit, Dearborn): Michigan shifted in Biden\u2019s favor by more than 164,000 votes. A quarter of that was because of this urban county, home to Detroit and Dearborn. It will tell the story of whether Harris was able to turn out Black voters (its population is 38% Black) and how much the war in Gaza hurts Harris. Wayne is home to 100,000 Arab Americans, the largest population of Arab Americans anywhere in the country.\n\n2. Oakland: This once-reliably Republican suburban Detroit county accounted for Biden\u2019s largest vote shift in 2020. It\u2019s one of the state\u2019s wealthiest, most educated and most populous counties in the state. It also has significant Black and AAPI populations that Harris needs to turn out for her to match Biden\u2019s success. The car industry has long roots here \u2014Stellantis, formerly Chrysler, is headquartered here \u2014 but the health care industry is one of the county\u2019s biggest employers and it has also seen a tech boom that has attracted younger and more diverse people.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n3. Macomb: This Detroit suburb is slightly more conservative than its neighbor Oakland, and it gave Trump more votes than any other county in the state in both 2016 and 2020. But Biden was able to slice into Trump\u2019s margin there. It\u2019s the kind of place Trump needs to run up the score and where Harris needs to keep it close.\n\n4. Washtenaw (Ann Arbor): Staying in the Detroit metro area, no other county gave Biden a wider margin of victory than this one. In fact, no Democrat, including Obama in 2008, won this county with a higher percentage of the vote. Home to the University of Michigan, it\u2019s the most educated county in the state and could indicate Harris\u2019 level of support with younger voters.\n\n5. Kent (Grand Rapids): This county in the western part of the state could signal which direction Michigan goes. It was once a Republican stronghold, but its growth and the ideological shifts within the parties has moved it more Democratic. It was one of only three counties statewide to go from Trump in 2016 to Biden in 2020.\n\nBoomerang: Saginaw. (Leelanau and Kent also flipped from Trump to Biden.)\n\ntoggle caption Brandon Bell/Getty Images\n\nNorth Carolina\n\n16 electoral votes\n\n2020 margin: R+1.3 (74,483 votes)\n\n1. Wake (Raleigh): It\u2019s the most populous county in the state and one of the fastest-growing in the country . That has meant a huge shift in its politics in favor of Democrats. In 2004, Republican George W. Bush won it with 51%. By 2008, Obama got 57% of the vote. Biden in 2020 won it with 63%. His margin of victory \u2014 167,000 \u2014 is 25,000 more than all of the votes Bush got in the county in 2000. Biden saw a 100,000-vote shift in his favor in the state; 60% of it came from this county. Harris has to drive up the score here with young voters and the state\u2019s most educated voters and white-collar professionals in other parts of the Research Triangle, like Durham and Orange, home to a host of big-name universities, like N.C. State, the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, Duke and Wake Forest.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n2. Mecklenburg (Charlotte): Charlotte is one of the fastest-growing cities in the country. The county has seen a 21% population increase since 2010 and that has helped Democrats make this state more competitive. Like in Wake, Biden gained an almost 60,000-vote shift here.\n\n3. Union: Just outside Charlotte, this is the highest-populated county that Trump won in the state in 2020. It\u2019s one of five counties that border Mecklenburg, all won by Trump. Watch the margins here. Biden was able to cut into them, and Harris will need to do the same.\n\n4. Robeson: What insulated Trump in North Carolina largely was his strength with white voters without college degrees. It\u2019s the one state of the seven swing states in 2020 where he saw an increase in his vote margin with non-college white voters. But this county, one of the poorest and most diverse in the state, represents what Trump\u2019s team has been able to do in appealing to rural, nonwhite voters. Robeson is 42% Native American, almost a quarter Black, 12% Latino, and had long voted Democratic. Yet Trump flipped it in 2016, then expanded his margin in 2020, winning with 59% of the vote there. He held one of his final rallies of the 2020 campaign in Robeson, pushing his message of the \u201cforgotten\u201d men and women after declaring his support for federal legislation that would recognize the Lumbee tribe .\n\n5. Henderson: This is one of the more populous Trump-won counties affected by Hurricane Helene in western North Carolina. Trump won a majority of the votes in counties affected by Helene. Turnout there will give some idea how Trump\u2019s vote is affected. Neighboring Buncombe County, home to Asheville, voted heavily Democratic, so Harris\u2019 campaign will be watching turnout closely there, as well.\n\nBoomerang: None. (Nash and New Hanover flipped from Trump to Biden. Scotland went from Biden to Trump.)\n\nGeorgia\n\n16 electoral votes\n\n2020 margin: D+0.23 (11,779 votes)\n\ntoggle caption Ryan Collerd/AFP via Getty Images\n\n1. Gwinnett: This county, which was long Republican-held, represents the growing \u2014 and diverse \u2014 suburbs in the Atlanta area (and in the country) that helped Biden win the state for Democrats for the first time since 1992. It has seen a population boom in the past decade, has a higher-than-average median income than the rest of the country, and it is majority nonwhite. Biden won it with 58%, up from 50% in 2020 and 45% for the Obama-Biden ticket in 2012. Does that pace continue? The growth in the Atlanta area is the main reason Democrats have made the state more competitive. Similarly, pay attention to Cobb and Henry.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n2. Hall: This is one of those populous, heavily Republican metro Atlanta counties Trump won by huge margins in 2020, but he won them by less than he did in 2016. To make up what was such a narrow margin statewide, Trump will look to drive up the score in places like this. Similarly, watch Paulding to the north and west of the city.\n\n3. Clayton: Just south of Atlanta, this will be a good test of Harris\u2019 ability to turn out Black voters. It\u2019s 73% Black, 15% Latino and is the sixth-most populated county in the state.\n\n4. Chatham (Savannah): So much attention is paid to the Atlanta metro area because of its size and growth, but watch the margins in places like Chatham, home to Savannah. It\u2019s among the counties Biden won in 2020 by more than Clinton did in 2016. Some notable others: Muscogee (Columbus), Richmond (Augusta), Bibb (Macon), Baldwin.\n\n5. Columbia: Just outside Augusta, this is one of those Trump-won counties, where Biden shrunk the margins. Others include: Houston (outside Macon), Effingham (outside Savannah), Glynn (Brunswick), Camden, Thomas and Lowndes.\n\n6. Peach: This low-population county in the south central portion of the state won\u2019t shift the state in a significant way by itself, but it will be a test of whether Harris can turn out rural Black voters to offset Trump\u2019s strength with white, non-college voters. It\u2019s 44% Black, went twice for Obama, but then flipped to Trump in 2016 and 2020, when Trump won it by a slightly higher margin.\n\nBoomerang: None. And no counties flipped Trump to Biden, either.\n\nArizona\n\n11 electoral votes\n\n2020 margin: D+0.31 (10,457 votes)\n\n1. Maricopa (Phoenix): Biden won the state by just over 10,000 votes, with a 100,000-vote swing from 2016 \u2014 90% of that came from Maricopa, home to Phoenix. It was the first time in decades that Democrats had won the county, and it gave Biden 61% of his votes statewide in 2020.\n\n2. Pima (Tucson): Biden ran up the score in this traditionally Democratic county. He netted 40,000 more votes here than Clinton in 2016. Similarly, watch Coconino (Flagstaff) and Apache, where Biden ran up the score in these Democratic-leaning counties.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n3. Pinal: Trump won by wider margins in Republican-leaning counties like this one than in 2016. But look to see if that trend continues here and also Yavapai, Mohave, Yuma and Cochise.\n\nBoomerang: None. But Maricopa was the big flip here from Trump to Biden.\n\nNevada\n\n6 electoral votes\n\n2020 margin: D+2.39 (33,596 votes)\n\n1. Clark (Las Vegas): Two-thirds of all the votes in the state come from this county, which is home to Las Vegas. It will tell us whether Trump\u2019s appeals on the economy to working-class Latino voters resonate. It is also home to a significant share of Asian American and Black voters.\n\n2. Washoe (Reno): It has mirrored the statewide vote percentages for both parties in every presidential election since 2004 \u2014 and went with the winner each time.\n\nBoomerang: None. Washoe is the key swing county.",

        "text": "Onmanorama Explains | The US presidential election where candidate who gets maximum votes can still lose\nOn Tuesday, November 5, the United States of America will elect its 47th president in a democratic process that is being watched keenly worldwide. For decades, the presidential election in the US has been a contest between the Republican and Democratic parties, and 2024 is no different.\n\nOn the Republican ticket, former president Donald Trump is seeking a second term in office after his defeat in the 2020 polls, while Vice President Kamala Harris had a surprise entry into the fray as the Democratic nominee after President Joe Biden was forced to drop out of the race midway during his campaign. Trump has chosen Ohio senator JD Vance as his vice presidential running mate, while Harris has Minnesota Governor Tim Walz on her side. There are also some independent candidates in the fray.\n\nUnlike the Indian democracy where voters directly elect parliamentarians, the US follows a multi-step system which works on the principle of ensuring each state's due representation in choosing the state head. The presidential election is held every four year.\n\nSteps of US presidential election\n\nA candidate must be a natural-born citizen of the United States, at least 35 years old, and a resident of the US for 14 years. Candidates are selected through processes known as primaries and caucuses held from January to June of the election year. The rules of holding primaries and caucuses may vary from state to state.\n\nPrimaries are directly run by state and local governments, while caucuses are controlled and run by political parties. In primaries, voters choose their candidate from a list on an official ballot.\n\nCaucuses, on the other hand, act more as a hectic political event in which interaction between voters is common, as is jockeying around for candidate support. The formats of both caucus primaries may differ in states. The most common type is open primaries, where voters \u2014 regardless of party affiliation \u2014 may choose to vote on any party\u2019s ballot, though they may only choose one. Partially open primaries similarly allow voters to cross party lines but may require voters to declare their ballot choice, and/or their selection can be regarded as a form of party registration.\n\nIn closed primaries, voters often must first register with a party and are only permitted to vote in that respective party\u2019s primary elections. Partially closed primaries are similar, with the difference being that parties themselves can choose whether to allow unaffiliated voters or those not registered with a party to vote in their primary. There are also states that allow unaffiliated voters to vote in any one primary but restrict those registered with a party to voting in that party\u2019s primary.\n\nNational conventions\n\nFrom July to early September of the election year, parties organise nominating conventions to choose their presidential nominees from the candidates selected through primaries and caucuses.\n\nAt the convention, the presidential nominee officially announces who will run with them for vice president.\n\nThrough September and October, candidates participate in presidential debates\u2014a crucial aspect of campaigning in the US. The candidates travel throughout the country and address rallies. The parties and the candidates use advertising, direct mailings, telephone campaigns, social media, and other means to gather support.\n\nGeneral election\n\nIn the presidential general election, citizens who are registered as voters can exercise their franchise. They can vote even if they did not vote in their state\u2019s primary elections.\n\nHowever, the president is not chosen by direct popular vote. The Constitution requires that the Electoral College ultimately decides who will win the general election.\n\nElectoral college\n\nThere are 538 electors in the country. The number of electoral votes allocated to a particular state equals its total congressional delegation, which includes the number of Senators and Representatives. California, for example, has 2 Senators and 52 Representatives, meaning the state has 54 electoral votes. Apart from the 50 states, the District of Columbia, which houses the capital region of Washington DC, has 3 electoral votes. Of the 538, a presidential candidate needs to win at least 270 of them to win the presidency.\n\nThe contesting political parties choose potential electors in every state before the election. The electors\u2019 names need not be included in the ballot alongside the presidential respective nominee\u2019s name. Electors in effect represent the nominees. The process of using electors comes from the US Constitution. The method was introduced as a compromise between a popular vote by citizens and a vote in Congress.\n\nThe votes cast by voters are counted statewide. All the states, except two, and Washington DC, allot their electoral votes to the candidate who leads in a state. For instance, all 54 of California\u2019s electoral votes go to the winner of the state election, no matter how small the victory margin is. The two exceptions -- Maine (four electoral votes) and Nebraska (five) -- assign their electors using a proportional system. The two states allocate two electoral votes to the statewide winner but allow each congressional district to award one electoral vote to the popular vote winner in their specific locality. In Maine, two out of four electoral votes, and in Nebraska, three out of five can potentially go to someone other than the statewide winner.\n\nThe candidate who gets at least 270 (269 (half of 538) + 1) electoral votes wins the election. The projected winner is usually announced once the popular votes are counted. However, the Electoral College casts their votes in mid-December. It is, in effect, only a formality as the result is already known.\n\nThe electoral votes are counted in early January, and the new president\u2019s term begins on January 20, which is known as Inauguration Day.\n\nThe Constitution does not require electors to vote for the candidate chosen by their state's popular vote. However, some states do have such rules. The rare elector who votes for someone else may be fined, disqualified, and replaced by a substitute elector. Or they may even be prosecuted by their state.\n\nWhy electoral votes are important?\n\nIn the US election system, it is possible that a candidate who polls the most votes nationally need not win the electoral vote. This happened in 1824, 1876, and 1888, as well as in 2000 and 2016.\n\nIn the 2000 presidential election, George W. Bush received fewer popular votes than Albert Gore Jr. but a majority of electoral votes. In 2016, Trump received fewer popular votes than Hillary Clinton but a majority of electoral votes.\n\nIn the Clinton vs Trump case, though millions more individuals voted for the Democratic candidate than the Republican candidate combined in California (CA), Pennsylvania (PA), and Texas (PX), the Democratic party was only awarded the electors appointed in California. Since the Republican candidate won more popular votes in PA and TX, the Republican party was awarded all the electoral votes in the two states (20+38 = 58). Meanwhile, Clinton had to settle for the 55 Democratic electors in CA as she had only lead in that state among the three.\n\nIf no candidate receives a majority of electoral votes, the presidential election leaves the Electoral College process and moves to Congress. The House of Representatives elects the president from the three candidates who received the most electoral votes.\n\nIn the remote scenario of a state\u2019s popular vote ending in a tie between candidates, the law effective in that State before the general election would determine how the tie should be broken.",

His daughter, a progressive political activist, said the decision was motivated by Ms. Harris\u2019s continued support for Israel in its war in Gaza .",
        "text": "Trump Hits Michigan and Pennsylvania, as Michelle Obama Rallies for Harris: Oct. 26 Campaign News\nAs the nation counted down this fall to a bitterly polarized election, the editorial board of The Los Angeles Times drew up a detailed outline for an endorsement that seemed obvious for an institution that had leaned liberal for generations: Vice President Kamala Harris should be the next president of the United States.\n\nA California native and resident of Los Angeles, Ms. Harris was not only a unifying and inspiring generational figure, in the board members\u2019 view, but also an important bulwark between Donald J. Trump and democratic institutions. They were unaware, however, that a different and more powerful group had been meeting \u2014 the family of Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, the newspaper\u2019s owner \u2014 with far different plans for the newspaper\u2019s voice.\n\nThis week, the biotech billionaire who had bought the paper in 2018 for $500 million acted on those plans with scant internal or public explanation, abruptly vetoing the planned endorsement, informing the board through an intermediary that The Los Angeles Times would make no recommendation in the presidential race.\n\nFor days, readers in overwhelmingly liberal Southern California speculated angrily about a decision that was widely regarded as a favor to Mr. Trump and a vote of no confidence in Ms. Harris.\n\nThousands of readers canceled subscriptions. Three members of the editorial board resigned. Nearly 200 staff members signed an open letter to management demanding an explanation, complaining that the decision this close to the election had undermined the news organization\u2019s trust with readers. The Times\u2019s News Guild, the newsroom\u2019s union, lodged a protest. In social media posts and subsequent interviews with his own news organization, Dr. Soon-Shiong framed the choice as an attempt at neutrality.\n\nBut in a statement on Saturday that was swiftly challenged by the paper, his daughter, Nika Soon-Shiong, 31, a progressive political activist who has frequently been accused of trying to meddle in the paper\u2019s news coverage, said the decision was motivated by Ms. Harris\u2019s continued support for Israel in its war in Gaza.\n\n\u201cOur family made the joint decision not to endorse a Presidential candidate. This was the first and only time I have been involved in the process,\u201d Ms. Soon-Shiong, who has no formal role at the paper, said in a statement to The New York Times. \u201cAs a citizen of a country openly financing genocide, and as a family that experienced South African Apartheid, the endorsement was an opportunity to repudiate justifications for the widespread targeting of journalists and ongoing war on children.\u201d\n\nImage The Los Angeles Times building. Credit... Mark Abramson for The New York Times\n\nIn a statement, Dr. Soon-Shiong said the daughter did not speak for the paper.\n\n\u201cNika speaks in her own personal capacity regarding her opinion, as every community member has the right to do,\u201d the owner said, according to a spokeswoman. \u201cShe does not have any role at The L.A. Times, nor does she participate in any decision or discussion with the editorial board, as has been made clear many times.\u201d\n\nThe editor of editorials, who was among those who have resigned, said she was taken aback by the daughter\u2019s assertion.\n\n\u201cIf that was the reason that Dr. Soon-Shiong blocked an endorsement of Kamala Harris, it was not communicated to me or the editorial writers,\u201d Mariel Garza, who resigned on Tuesday, said in a statement. \u201cIf the family\u2019s goal was to \u2018repudiate justifications for the widespread targeting of journalists and ongoing war on children,\u2019 remaining silent did not accomplish that.\u201d\n\nOver the past six years, writers and editors have increasingly chafed at interference by Dr. Soon-Shiong, 72, and his family in the newsroom, where owners are generally regarded less as proprietors with the right to impose their personal views than as guardians of a public trust.\n\nIn January, Kevin Merida stepped down as executive editor after clashing with Dr. Soon-Shiong over an unpublished article about an acquaintance of the newspaper owner, as well as other conflicts in the newsroom. Just a few weeks later, the publication carried out its most widespread layoffs in more than a decade, cutting 115 journalists in a move that slashed the newsroom by more than 20 percent.\n\nBut the dispute over the endorsement \u2014 echoed two days later when The Washington Post announced that it would also not make an endorsement in the race \u2014 prompted urgent new questions about what had motivated the decision.\n\nSpeaking this week on the cable news outlet Spectrum, which regularly carries Los Angeles Times content, Dr. Soon-Shiong was asked about a possible political motivation. \u201cI want us desperately to air all the voices on the opinion side, on the op-ed side,\u201d he said. He said he did not know whether readers viewed him or his family as ultra-progressive or not. \u201cBut I\u2019m an independent.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with one of his own reporters on Friday, Dr. Soon-Shiong said that his stand was not based on any single issue, nor did he intend by withholding an endorsement to favor either Ms. Harris or Mr. Trump. \u201cWe should be an organization that stands up and says the facts,\u201d presenting views across the political spectrum, he said. \u201cI think that the country needs that desperately.\u201d\n\nSeveral senior editors at The Times said they were not briefed on the reasons for Dr. Soon-Shiong\u2019s decision, but they noted that he had often been critical of the Biden administration, had boasted of having dinner with Mr. Trump after he won the presidency in 2016 and often has approvals pending with the federal Food and Drug Administration. They speculated that he may have been hedging his bets over a range of issues.\n\nOne person potentially in a position to know was the publication\u2019s current executive editor, Terry Tang, who replaced Mr. Merida. In a departure from the practice at most major news organizations, which have a clear organizational separation between news and opinion, Ms. Tang, who had been the publication\u2019s editorial page editor, took on oversight of both departments when she became the executive editor. Ms. Tang previously served as an editor at The New York Times for 20 years.\n\nMs. Tang did not respond to requests for comment and did not appear to have addressed the staff over the issue.\n\nMariel Garza, the editorials editor who resigned, said that she had been caught completely off guard. Dr. Soon-Shiong, she said, had been told in late September that the board planned to endorse Ms. Harris, an unsurprising choice given The Times\u2019s past criticism of Mr. Trump and its generally liberal editorial stances. Ms. Harris, who is originally from the Bay Area, has been married for more than a decade to a Los Angeles entertainment lawyer, Doug Emhoff, and has kept a home in the upscale West Los Angeles neighborhood of Brentwood.\n\nMs. Garza said she became increasingly concerned as weeks passed without approval of the endorsement from the owner. Two weeks ago, she said, she learned from Ms. Tang that Dr. Soon-Shiong had decided against issuing an endorsement. She said Ms. Tang told her that he had not given a clear rationale for the decision.\n\nMs. Garza, who was the first to resign on the editorial board, said she felt no choice but to leave.\n\n\u201cThis is our duty,\u201d she said in an interview on Friday. \u201cIt is. This is a scary time, and we all need to be brave, and not be cowed.\u201d\n\nImage Mariel Garza in 2022. Credit... Ricardo Dearatanha/Los Angeles Times, via Associated Press\n\nBy the end of the week, two more editorial board members, Karin Klein and Robert Greene, a 2021 Pulitzer Prize winner, had also resigned. All vigorously contested Dr. Soon-Shiong\u2019s assertion that they had chosen to remain silent.\n\n\u201cThis is not about disagreeing with the owner,\u201d said Ms. Klein, an author and specialist in education who has been with The Times for 35 years, 22 of them as an editorial writer. \u201cTo do this a couple weeks before the election is truly doing an editorial \u2014 a make-believe, invisible editorial that sends a message that we have doubts about Kamala.\u201d\n\nThe confrontation over the endorsement comes after years of uneasy relations between the owner and the newsroom.\n\nReporters and editors have chafed at phone calls, emails and social media postings offering questions and suggestions about news coverage both from Dr. Soon-Shiong and his daughter. In the past, she has been critical of the publication\u2019s coverage of crime, policing and Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, among other things.\n\nSeveral reporters interviewed described Ms. Soon-Shiong contacting them directly with critiques of their coverage, or publicly posting her negative opinions about their stories on social media. A former editor recalled reporters worrying about whether her comments were actually coming from her father.\n\n\u201cYou never know how much Nika is speaking for herself and how much Nika is speaking for her whole family,\u201d the editor said.\n\nEarly in the coronavirus pandemic, Dr. Soon-Shiong wanted medical reporters to investigate connections between Covid-19 and cancer, which many perceived as a story that, if published, would further his business interests, two people with knowledge of the situation said.\n\nLate last year, he tried to dissuade the former executive editor, Mr. Merida from publishing a story about a doctor who was an acquaintance of his. After clashing with Dr. Soon-Shiong over staffing levels and newsroom management, Mr. Merida left the paper in January.\n\nSeveral sources told The New York Times at the time that Dr. Soon-Shiong had stepped in to make inquiries about the newspaper\u2019s reporting on the doctor, who was embroiled in dueling lawsuits with a woman who claimed to have been bitten by his dog.\n\nAt one point, Dr. Soon-Shiong contacted Mr. Merida demanding to see a copy of the story and suggesting that it should not be published, the New York Times reporting showed. Dr. Soon-Shiong also told Mr. Merida on a call that he would fire journalists if he learned they were concealing the completed article from him. A story was finally published in April.\n\nA Los Angeles Times spokeswoman said in a statement this year that Dr. Soon-Shiong had not wanted the newspaper to be used as a \u201csource of exploitation\u201d in the legal dispute. \u201cHe simply urged the editors to ensure that an investigation was done before any story was published.\u201d\n\nMs. Soon-Shiong had telegraphed the concerns over Ms. Harris\u2019s Israel policy in a post on social media earlier this week about the publication\u2019s decision not to endorse.\n\n\u201cThis is not a vote for Donald Trump. This is a refusal to ENDORSE a candidate that is overseeing a war on children. I\u2019m proud of the LA Times\u2019 decision,\u201d she posted on X.\n\nBut until her statement to The New York Times on Saturday, she had remained silent about how to interpret the posting.\n\n\u201cFor the sake of the living and in the name of the dead, for the sake of our collective humanity \u2014 we must raise the moral floor,\u201d she said in the statement.\n\nIn his own social media post this week, Dr. Soon-Shiong had pushed back on Ms. Garza\u2019s version of events surrounding the endorsement decision. He wrote on X that he had directed the editorial board to compare the policies of each candidate, and let readers decide whom to choose. \u201cInstead of adopting this path as suggested, the Editorial Board chose to remain silent and I accepted their decision,\u201d he said.\n\nIn Southern California, civic leaders have expressed outrage at what many have viewed as an abdication of responsibility by a major news outlet in the most populous state in the nation.\n\n\u201cNewspapers serve as the civic conscience for communities around the country. In that role, they have the ability to speak truth to power,\u201d said Austin Beutner, a local financier who has served in a number of high-profile leadership positions in Los Angeles, including a brief stint a decade ago as publisher and chief executive of The Los Angeles Times. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible loss for society when they abdicate that responsibility.\u201d\n\nBut it is inside the Times newsroom where most of the alarm has spread.\n\n\u201cWe endorsed every other race on the ballot this year \u2014 it doesn\u2019t make sense to pull your punch with the most consequential office in the most consequential election that any of us can remember,\u201d said Robin Abcarian, a columnist who has worked there for more than three decades. \u201cAnd this is what\u2019s puzzling to everybody: It\u2019s this lingering feeling that something isn\u2019t being expressed, and we don\u2019t know what.\u201d\n\nImage Dr. Soon-Shiong at a vaccine manufacturing facility in Cape Town, South Africa, in 2022. Credit... Shelley Christians/Reuters\n\nSome were urging a more public explanation of the politics behind the endorsement decision, if there was any.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s an explanation, he should say so,\u201d said Ms. Klein, the former editorial board member. \u201cWhen you have a gap in information like this, the tendency among readers is to fill it in. Is this his daughter expressing opposition on Gaza? Is he hoping Trump will lower his taxes? Does he have pharmaceuticals pending before the F.D.A. and he\u2019s worried about approval from a Trump administration? He should tell people.\u201d\n\nJim Newton, a former editorial page editor of the paper who is now a historian and lecturer at the University of California, Los Angeles, shared an email exchange he had with Ms. Tang, after the news broke, in which he urged Ms. Tang to reconsider. The decision not to endorse, he told her, set back years of effort to restore the paper \u201cto a place of civic responsibility and candor with readers\u201d and \u201cunravels a lot of hard, important work, and at a particularly unwise time.\u201d\n\nMs. Tang responded with a brief thank you, and later told him that she did not believe Mr. Newton understood the situation.\n\n\u201cSeems like maybe you don\u2019t either,\u201d he replied. \u201cYou assured me a few months ago that the editorial board controlled endorsements. You sure about that?\u201d\n\nDan Morain, a former Los Angeles Times staff writer who went on to become the editorial page editor of The Sacramento Bee, said that a paper can justify not endorsing in a presidential campaign because people usually have enough information.\n\n\u201cThe blunder here is that the decision was announced almost on the eve of the election, so it becomes fodder for one of the candidates,\u201d he said. \u201cIf The Times wasn\u2019t going to endorse in this presidential race, where a hometown candidate was running, they should have announced this six months ago. But they didn\u2019t. So it plays into Trump\u2019s hands, which is just terrible. And it raises so many questions about the owners and whether their financial interests are trumping their journalistic obligations.\u201d\n\nMs. Abcarian, the Times columnist, said she remained grateful that Dr. Soon-Shiong saved the publication when he did, and continues to invest in it during a difficult time for the news business. But she said that his explanations for pulling the endorsement felt inadequate.\n\nShe has been heartbroken by the public response to the endorsement debacle, she added. One of her closest friends, who had subscribed to the paper for 40 years, canceled this week.\n\n\u201cThe staff is demoralized on a number of fronts, and this just kind of pours salt in the wound,\u201d she said.\n\nBenjamin Mullin and Katie Robertson contributed reporting.",

But if polls are once again underestimating the Republican vote, the ex-president could well be ahead.\n\nThe heart of the problem hasn't changed since Trump's dramatic 2016 upset, experts said, with a chunk of his electorate refusing to respond to polls.\n\n\"We haven't found a silver bullet,\" Courtney Kennedy, vice president of methods and innovation at the Pew Research Center, told AFP.\n\nIn the meantime, each polling firm is taking its own steps to try and rectify the issue.\n\nPhoning a Trump friend\n\nIn 2020, many people when reached by phone \"would just simply yell at us 'Trump!' and hang up,\" said Don Levy, director of the Siena College Research Institute, which conducts highly regarded polling for the New York Times.\n\nIn an attempt to better account for such voters, Siena now registers responses from people who hang up, even if they don't answer all of their questions.\n\nIt also tries several times to reach people who don't pick up the first time, Levy said.\n\n\"If we call them the third or fourth time, we get more of them, so more callbacks, more potential Trump voters in the sample.\"\n\nPew on the other hand, Kennedy said, now allows respondents to answer online or by phone.\n\n\"We get very different types of people participating those different ways,\" she said.\n\nPhoto: AFP / SAUL LOEB\n\nWeighting the data\n\nOnce responses have been collected, pollsters must decide how to weight the data.\n\nIf a particular group is under-represented in the data compared to their proportion of the general population - for example, Republicans from rural areas - those responses are usually given greater weight in the final calculation.\n\nLevy said the New York Times/Siena poll performs weighting based on what they think the 2024 electorate will look like, using previous elections as a reference point, along with a mix of other factors.\n\nJoshua Clinton, a political science professor at Vanderbilt University, expressed caution about weighting purely based on previous elections.\n\n\"Suppose there's more enthusiasm among Democrats than Republicans... then weighting to 2020 will basically undercut the support among Democrats in your poll,\" he told AFP.\n\nIt's a \"no-win situation,\" said Clinton, with pollsters only able to find out if their weighting was correct until after actual voter data comes in.\n\n\"We're weighting to a universe that doesn't yet exist,\" said Levy.\n\n'Who knows?'\n\nWith so much focus on Trump voters possibly missing from polls, Clinton warns that on the flip-side, Democratic support may also be underestimated.\n\nAfter 2016 and 2020, \"you may be tempted to conclude that the polls are always going to understate Republicans... but that's not true,\" he said.\n\nIn Michigan, a key state in this year's presidential election, polls underestimated Democratic support in the 2022 midterm elections, he noted.\n\n\"Who knows what's going to happen in 2024?\"\n\nSiena College's Levy also raised the possibility of a \"shy Harris voter,\" someone who does not want to publicly disclose their support for the vice president, possibly because they live among staunch Trump supporters.\n\nWhen asked if polls could be over-correcting for missing Trump supporters, Pew's Kennedy expressed skepticism.\n\n\"I've seen enough data to make it very clear that it's really hard for surveys to reach enough Trump supporters and to do a really fulsome job getting that right,\" she said.\n\nWith the contest so tight and well within the margin of error, \"we really should just tell ourselves... it's tied, and not pretend that we can get stuff right in the decimal place,\" she said.\n\n\"That's just fantasy land.\"\n\n- AFP",

        "summary": " Final results may lag in deadlocked presidential contest, anxious election officials warn . Closing of the polls and end of mail-in voting kick off a nearly three-month process . The next president of the United States is sworn in on Inauguration Day in January .",
        "text": "Final results may lag in deadlocked presidential contest, anxious election officials warn \u2022 Washington State Standard\nWASHINGTON \u2014 As an exceedingly bitter, tight and dark campaign for the presidency moves into its last moments, apprehensive election officials and experts warn Election Day is only the first step.\n\nThe closing of the polls and end of mail-in voting kick off a nearly three-month process before the next president of the United States is sworn in on Inauguration Day in January. New guardrails were enacted by Congress in 2022 to more fully protect the presidential transition, following the Jan. 6, 2021 mob attack on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters and a failed scheme to install fake electors.\n\nBut even before that shift to a new chief executive begins, a presidential victor is unlikely to be announced election night or even the following day.\n\nIt\u2019s a result that will possibly take days to determine, given tight margins expected in seven swing states. Officials needed four days to count all the votes to determine President Joe Biden the victor of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nIn states like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, the law does not allow that process to begin for millions of mail-in ballots until Election Day. Other states allow pre-processing of ballots.\n\nTrey Grayson, Kentucky\u2019s former Republican secretary of state, said ballot authentication could be on different timelines across the country after voting ends on Election Day.\n\n\u201cWe have 50 states, plus D.C., that pretty much all do it differently,\u201d Grayson, who served as president of the National Association of Secretaries of State, told reporters Friday on a call of bipartisan former state election officials who are working to explain the process to the public.\n\nIt could mean \u201cin a very close election that we don\u2019t know on election night who the president is or who controls the House or the Senate, but we should feel confident over the next couple of days, as we work through that, that we\u2019re going to get there,\u201d he said.\n\nLawsuits and potential recounts\n\nThose delays, which former President Donald Trump seized on to spread the baseless lie that the election was stolen from him, are expected again in November, especially as all eyes will be on the battleground states \u2014 Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nAdditionally, there already are hundreds of pre-election lawsuits, mainly filed by Republicans, ranging from election integrity challenges to accusations of noncitizens allowed to vote in federal elections \u2014 something that rarely happens and is already illegal. The legal challenges could further spark delays.\n\n\u201cWe will not have a winner on election night most likely and so we need to be able to prepare the public for this,\u201d said Virginia Kase Solom\u00f3n, the president and CEO of the democracy watchdog group Common Cause, during a Tuesday briefing.\n\nShe added that her organization will focus on combating misinformation and disinformation on election night and beyond.\n\n\u201cThere is the potential that somebody could claim the win before \u2026 all of the votes have been counted,\u201d she said.\n\nIn the early morning hours after Election Day in 2020, before results from key states were determined, Trump falsely claimed he won in an address at the White House.\n\nOn top of that, experts say this year could see election denial erupting in countless courtrooms and meeting rooms in localities and the states, as well as across social media, if doubts are sown about the results.\n\nRecounts could also delay an official election result, and the laws vary from state to state.\n\nFor example, in Pennsylvania, if a candidate demands a recount, three voters from each of the over 9,000 precincts have to petition for a recount.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never seen that happen actually in Pennsylvania,\u201d Kathy Boockvar, the commonwealth\u2019s former Democratic secretary of state, said on Friday\u2019s call with reporters.\n\nAn automatic statewide recount is triggered in Pennsylvania if there\u2019s a difference of a half percent of all votes cast for the winner and loser. The final recount results, by law, are due to the secretary of state by Nov. 26, and results would be announced on Nov. 27, Boockvar said.\n\nThe margin in Pennsylvania\u2019s 2020 results for the presidential election was between 1.1% and 1.2%, not enough to trigger the automatic recount, Boockvar said.\n\nTaking out the shrubs\n\nState election officials have been preparing for the past year to train poll workers to not only run the voting booths but for possible violence \u2014 a precaution put in place after the 2020 election \u2014 and have beefed up security around polling locations.\n\nOn Friday, Trump posted on X that the election \u201cwill be under the closest professional scrutiny and, WHEN I WIN, those people that CHEATED will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the Law, which will include long term prison sentences so that this Depravity of Justice does not happen again.\u201d\n\nA reporter asked Grayson about the possibility of aggression from poll watchers. The Republican National Committee announced in April a \u201chistoric move to safeguard the integrity of the electoral process,\u201d establishing party-led trainings for poll watchers.\n\nPoll watchers are not a new concept, and Grayson said clear \u201csafeguards\u201d are in place.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re intimidating, you\u2019re gone. There\u2019s clear laws in every state on that,\u201d he said.\n\nCelestine Jeffreys, the city clerk in Green Bay, Wisconsin, said during a Wednesday roundtable with election workers that the city has an Election Day protocol in place that includes everything from blocking off streets to City Hall to getting rid of shrubbery.\n\n\u201cWe have actually removed bushes in front of City Hall\u201d to ensure no one can be concealed behind them, she said. In the second assassination attempt on Trump earlier this year, a gunman hid in bushes outside Trump\u2019s private golf course.\n\nNew Mexico Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver said during a Tuesday briefing she is focused on the physical safety of election officials.\n\nDuring the event with the National Association of Secretaries of State, she said such safety is not only a priority during voting but when officials move to certify the state\u2019s election results in December.\n\n\u201cWe have all been spending a lot more time on physical security and making sure that our election officials at all levels are more physically secure this year,\u201d Toulouse Oliver said. \u201cAnd of course, you know when our electors meet in our states, you know, ensuring for the physical security of that process and those individuals as well.\u201d\n\nOn Dec. 17, each state\u2019s electors will meet to vote for the president and vice president. Congress will vote to certify the results on Jan. 6.\n\n\u201cWe are thinking a lot more about this in 2024 than we did in 2020, but I think that each one of us\u2026 have a playbook in mind for how to handle any unanticipated eventualities in the certification process,\u201d she said.\n\nIt\u2019s a security precaution that the U.S. Secret Service is also taking.\n\nFor the first time, Congress\u2019 certification of the Electoral College on Jan. 6 has been designated a National Special Security Event, something that is usually reserved for Inauguration Day on Jan. 20.\n\nThe 2020 experience\n\nIn 2020, The Associated Press did not call the presidential election for Biden until 11:26 a.m. Saturday, Nov. 7 \u2014 roughly three-and-a-half days after polls closed. The AP, as well as other media organizations, project election winners after local officials make initial tabulations public.\n\nThose tallies are then canvassed, audited and certified, according to each state\u2019s legal timeline. Recounts may also extend the timeline before final certification.\n\nThe vote totals reported in Pennsylvania \u2014 a state that carried 20 Electoral College votes in 2020 \u2014 put Biden over the top for the 270 needed to win the presidency.\n\nTrump refused to concede the race, and instead promised to take his fight to court.\n\nFor the next two months, Trump and his surrogates filed just over 60 lawsuits challenging the results in numerous states. Ultimately none of the judges found evidence of widespread voter fraud.\n\nThe next step was for Congress to count each state\u2019s certified slate of electors, which by law, it must do on the Jan. 6 following a presidential election.\n\nHowever, in the weeks leading up to Jan. 6, Trump and his private lawyers worked to replace legitimate slates of electors with fake ones, according to hundreds of pages of records compiled by a special congressional investigation, and by the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nTrump pressured then-Vice President Mike Pence to block ratification of the Electoral College\u2019s vote at the Jan. 6 joint session of Congress, because the vice president\u2019s role in the certification of electoral votes was not exactly clear in the Electoral Count Act of 1887.\n\nPence ultimately refused.\n\nThousands of Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 following a \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally at The Ellipse park, south of the White House, where Trump told the crowd \u201cWe will never concede.\u201d\n\nThe mob assaulted police officers, broke windows to climb inside and hurled violent threats aimed at elected officials, including the desire to \u201chang\u201d Pence. More than 1,500 defendants have been charged by the Department of Justice.\n\nCongress stopped its process of reviewing the state electors in the 2 p.m. Eastern hour as police ushered the lawmakers to safety. The joint session resumed at roughly 11:30 p.m., and Pence called the majority of electoral votes for Biden at nearly 4 a.m. on Jan. 7.\n\nNew law on presidential transition\n\nTo deter another Jan. 6 insurrection, Congress passed the Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transitional Improvement Act of 2022 as part of a massive appropriations bill.\n\nThe Electoral Count Reform Act codifies into law that the vice president, who also serves as the president of the U.S. Senate, only ceremoniously reads aloud a roll call of the votes.\n\nMost notably, the provision raises the threshold for lawmakers to make an objection to electors. Previously, only one U.S. House representative and one U.S. senator would need to make an objection to an elector or slate of electors.\n\nBut under the new law, it would take one-fifth of members to lodge an objection and under very specific standards \u2014 87 House members and 20 senators.\n\nThe Electoral Count Reform Act also identifies that each state\u2019s governor is the official responsible for submitting the state\u2019s official document that identifies the state\u2019s appointed electors, and says that Congress cannot accept that document from any official besides the governor, unless otherwise specified by the state\u2019s law.\n\nTrump and his allies tried to replace legitimate slates of electors in several states with fake electors who would cast ballots for Trump.\n\nThe Presidential Transitional Improvement Act provides candidates with funding and resources for transitional planning, even if a candidate has not conceded after the election.\n\nThere are already issues with the transition of power. The top Democrat on the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability, Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin, sent a Wednesday letter to Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, urging them to sign documents to ensure a peaceful transition of power.\n\n\u201cWith fewer than three weeks left until an election in which the American people will select a new President of the United States, I urge you to put the public\u2019s interest in maintaining a properly functioning government above any personal financial or political interests you may perceive in boycotting the official transition law and process,\u201d Raskin wrote.\n\nDenial expected at all levels of government\n\nExperts warn the effort to delay certification of the vote is largely being fought at the local and state levels, and that several groups are gearing up to sow doubt in the election outcome.\n\nDevin Burghart, president of the Institute for Research and Education on Human Rights, said on a press call Wednesday that since 2020, \u201celection denial has shifted away from the capital to county election commission meetings, courtrooms, cyber symposiums and countless conspiracies in preparation for a repeat this November.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis time, the baseless claim that undocumented immigrants are somehow swamping the polls has fueled the \u2018big lie\u2019 machine,\u201d Burghart said.\n\nKim Wyman, the former Washington state secretary of state, said the noncitizen topic is not new.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to level set and remind everyone that it\u2019s been illegal at the federal level since 1996 and you know, when you think back on 2002 the Help America Vote Act basically required voters to provide ID when they register, which is usually a driver\u2019s license or a Social Security number, and states are checking that data against the DMV database. And these protections are enormously successful,\u201d said Wyman.\n\nIn two high-profile cases, the U.S. Department of Justice sued Republican-led efforts in Alabama and Virginia to purge voter rolls after alleging thousands of noncitizens were registered to vote. Both states were ordered to stop the programs and reinstate voters \u2013 though Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin promised Friday to appeal and even escalate to the Supreme Court.\n\nIn Georgia, the state\u2019s Supreme Court delayed new rules until after this election that would have required three poll workers at every precinct to count ballots by hand once the polls closed \u2014 essentially delaying unofficial election results.\n\nMore than 165 electoral process lawsuits across 37 states have been filed by both parties since 2023 leading up to the 2024 presidential election, according to a survey by Bloomberg of pre-election cases. The journalists found that more than half the cases have been filed in swing states, and challenge almost every facet of the voting process, from absentee voting, to voter roll management, voter eligibility and vote certification.\n\nRepublican and conservative groups have filed roughly 55% of the lawsuits, mostly aimed at narrowing who can vote, and overall most of the cases were filed in August and September, according to the analysis.\n\nCourts threw out dozens of lawsuits claiming voter fraud in 2020.\n\nMai Ratakonda, senior counsel at States United Democracy Center, said anti-democracy groups have used litigation \u201cto legitimize their efforts to sow doubt in our election system.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve unfortunately continued to see this trend of filing lawsuits to bolster and legitimize narratives that our elections are insecure and laying the groundwork to contest results later,\u201d Ratakonda told reporters on a press call Wednesday hosted by the organization, whose stated mission is to protect nonpartisan election administration.\n\nTimeline of key presidential election dates Nov. 5, 2024\u2014Election Day\n\nThe voters in each state choose electors to serve in the Electoral College.\n\nThe voters in each state choose electors to serve in the Electoral College.

That doesn't make them bad people,\" he explained.\n\nVance emphasised that people should not let politics break apart their relationships.\n\n\"Whether you vote for me and Donald Trump, whether you vote for Kamala Harris, don't cast aside family members and lifelong friendships. Politics is not worth it. I think, if we follow this principle, we heal the divide in this country,\" said Vance.\n\nThe US presidential election is set to take place on November 5.\n\nPublished By: Girish Kumar Anshul Published On: Oct 26, 2024",

        "text": "How do US presidential elections affect the economy and the stock market?\nWith the US presidential election on a knife edge and just a week away, financial markets are watching with bated breath.\n\nThere\u2019s no shortage of reasons to be nervous. Both sides have outlined radically different visions of America\u2019s economic future, with major implications for the rest of the world.\n\nAll of this stands against the backdrop of simmering tensions with China and an ongoing crisis in the Middle East. The price of gold \u2013 a common way for investors to hedge against uncertainty \u2013 has soared to record heights.\n\nMany have been speculating about what might be in store for the stock market and the economy \u2013 both in the United States and here in Australia.\n\nObviously, that depends on far more than just who is sitting in the Oval Office. However, looking at history still tells an interesting \u2013 and perhaps surprising \u2013 story.\n\nRead more: From mass deportations to huge tariff hikes, here's what Trump's economic program would do to the US and Australia\n\nElephants, donkeys, bulls and bears\n\nIn the United States, both sides of the political divide are subject to some oversimplifying stereotypes.\n\nDemocrats are often seen as the party of proactive government spending, favouring policies that redistribute wealth through taxation. Republicans, on the other hand, have a reputation as the business-friendly party of small government, favouring more passive policies with lower tax rates.\n\nSo, it might surprise you to learn that if we zoom out and look at a big chunk of the past century, the US economy and its stock markets have actually performed better under Democratic presidencies, on two key measures.\n\nResearch by Lubos Pastor and Pietro Veronesi from the University of Chicago examined the period between 1927 and 2015.\n\nThey found average growth in gross domestic product (GDP) was 4.86% under Democratic presidents. Under Republican presidencies, it averaged 1.7%.\n\nOver the same period, the US share market\u2019s \u201cequity risk premium\u201d was also 10.9% higher under Democratic presidents than Republicans. In the years from 1999 to 2015, it was even higher under democratic presidents \u2013 17.4%.\n\nThis is the excess rate of return that can be earned by investing in shares above the \u201crisk-free rate\u201d (such as the interest rate on a savings account).\n\nWhy is it worth looking at the risk premium instead of total share market returns? Because it helps separate out the effect of interest rates.\n\nThe return on assets like shares is comprised of the risk-free rate from banks plus this risk premium. Risk-free rates are largely determined by central banks, which in most countries are independent from the government.\n\nWhat might be driving this effect?\n\nWhether this performance reflects good luck or good policies is much harder to answer. If the effect was arising from superior policy decisions, it would imply voters have been repeatedly failing to reward good government.\n\nPastor and Veronesi argue something different \u2013 that when the economy is weak and stock prices are low, voters are more risk-averse. That can lead them to prefer the wealth redistribution policies of the Democrats.\n\nThe last three transitions from Republican to Democratic presidencies support this theory. Bill Clinton was elected shortly after the 1990-91 recession, Barack Obama at the peak of the global financial crisis, and Joe Biden during the pandemic.\n\nAs the economy recovers from a crisis, stock prices often increase. Pastor and Veronesi\u2019s thesis suggests that the election \u2013 and the good performance - of Democratic presidents comes down to the timing of voters\u2019 heightened risk aversion.\n\nHighly interlinked economies\n\nHistorically, monthly stock returns in Australia and the US have been highly correlated \u2013 my calculations show this is even more so in election years.\n\nCorrelation famously doesn\u2019t say anything about causation, just that when we see change in one, we typically see a similar change in the other. That means some of the effects we described earlier can be felt here (and around the world), as well.\n\nExpanding their long-term analysis internationally, Pastor and Veronesi found that the average equity risk premium of Australian stocks was also higher under Democratic presidencies in the US \u2013 by 11.3%!\n\nSimilar higher returns were also observed in the United Kingdom \u2013 7.3%. And they were even larger in Canada, France, and Germany \u2013 all about 13%.\n\nTwo factors may help explain why what happens in the US is so wide-reaching. Stocks in these markets are globally owned. US presidential elections may reflect the cycle of global risk aversion, which in turn affects local stock markets.\n\nThese economies and financial markets are also highly integrated with the US in areas such as trade, making their economic cycles highly correlated.\n\nA stock market boom?\n\nWill a win by the Democrats in November usher in a stock market boom? It\u2019s unlikely, for two reasons.\n\nFirst, a win by the Democrats would be a continuation, not a transition from a Republican president. It would not represent policy changes favoured by more risk-averse voters.\n\nSecond, it would be a Democratic win in a booming economy. The US economy has been going strong since the end of the pandemic.\n\nIt added 254,000 jobs in September, the strongest job growth in six months. It also grew at an annualised pace of 3% in the second quarter of 2024, above its average of below 2% over the past decade.\n\nOther research suggests some important caveats, too. On average, the short-term market reaction to an election does not favour the Democrats or the Republicans.\n\nHowever, a surprise win by a Republican \u2013 that is, one contrary to prediction markets \u2013 is associated with 2-3% higher returns around election days.\n\nOne possible reason for this is that unlike voters, equity fund managers are more likely to be Republican-leaning. A surprise win by their favoured candidate can boost stock prices when the winner is declared.\n\nRead more: A new book reveals much of Trump's success is based on a myth he is a self-made billionaire",
