        "text": "Assassination attempts, pets and Taylor Swift: the US election is wild\nBefore Biden dropped out of the 2024 ticket, multiple national polls had the president trailing Trump (who had recently survived an assassination attempt) by only 1 or 2 percentage points. And before Harris\u2019 successful debate last week, the race was even closer, with various polls showing Harris closely behind Trump, tied with Trump, or even slightly ahead of the former president.\n\nIn the same way the July 13 assassination attempt saw Trump\u2019s approval rating increasing by less than 2 percentage points, the polls after Harris\u2019 debate performance appear to have on average only shifted in her favour by less than a single percentange point.\n\nHalf a year ago \u2013 and many political lifetimes before any of these events occurred \u2013 Trump averaged an approval rating of 47 percent. Today, that number is exactly the same. His approval has yet to go below 44 percent or above 49 percent over the past half year \u2013 essentially remaining within the margin of error. In other words, regardless of events, views of Trump \u2013 much like views of Harris and Biden \u2013 will likely remain largely unchanged.\n\nA once-in-a-century pandemic, an insurrection, criminal convictions and even an assassination attempt may feel seismic to Americans \u2013 and those outside looking in \u2013 but the calcification of US political polarisation remains.\n\nHowever, given the slimmest of margins for the last two presidential elections \u2013 a total of 0.03 percent of Americans decided the 2020 election \u2013 even the most seemingly inconsequential events may prove decisive.",

The election is here, and our adversaries have wasted no time in attempting to interfere. Earlier this week, Microsoft\u2019s Threat Analysis Center (MTAC) reported efforts by our adversaries to interfere in our elections leveraging both old and new tactics. Earlier this month the United States Government sanctioned[1] Russian actors for their attempts to influence the election.[2]\n\nThe threats to our democracy from abroad are sophisticated and persistent. We must stand together as a tech community, as leaders, and as a nation to protect the integrity of our elections. We pursue this work guided by two key principles:\n\nWe must uphold the foundational principle of free expression for our citizens. We must protect the American electorate from foreign nation-state cyber interference.\n\nOur adversaries target our democracy in part because they fear the open and free expression it promotes and the success it has brought our country.\n\nCurrent State of Nation-State Interference\n\nAmong Microsoft\u2019s vast team of security professionals, dozens are part of Microsoft\u2019s Threat Analysis Center (MTAC), a team whose mission is to detect, assess, and disrupt cyber influence threats to Microsoft, its customers, and democracies worldwide. Part of MTAC\u2019s mission is protecting elections from nation-state adversaries who seek to use online operations to distort the information going to voters, change the outcome of an election, or interfere in electoral processes.\n\nAs MTAC has observed and reported, foreign adversaries are using cyber influence operations to target both political parties in the 2024 U.S. presidential election. In the last two years, Microsoft has detected and analyzed cyber-attacks and cyber-enabled influence operations stemming from Russia, Iran, and China, many of which pertain to elections and elections infrastructure.\n\nThis follows similar activity Microsoft has observed in several other countries that recently have held national elections. This includes the 2023 elections in the Netherlands and Slovakia and, in 2024, the Taiwanese, EU, UK and French elections (as well as the 2024 Paris Summer Olympics). Since the beginning of this year, we have been working directly with elected government officials and often with the public to combat these threats. We have used our findings to better understand adversarial behavior and intentions leading into the upcoming 2024 U.S. election, including with respect to nation states\u2019 malicious employment of generative AI, of which we have detected and analyzed many such instances.\n\nToday, we see Iran, Russia, and China using cyber operations to target the U.S. election in November. Iranian operations have targeted candidates of both parties but are inclined to denigrate former President Trump\u2019s campaign, which indicates a preference for a Harris victory. Russian operations, meanwhile, are inclined to denigrate Vice President Harris\u2019s campaign, indicating a preference for a Trump victory. China, for its part, has aimed to collect intelligence and to stoke discord, while to date not showing a clear preference for a specific candidate.\n\nLet me share more about the details in what we have detected so far this year:\n\nIran\n\nSo far in 2024, Iranian election interference mirrors what we observed from Iran in 2020 in tempo, timing, and targets. As we reported in an August 8 report,[3] an Iranian actor we track as Sefid Flood, known for impersonating social and political activist groups, started in March to lay the groundwork for U.S. election cyber-enabled operations. Additionally, Iranian-linked covert propaganda sites and social media networks began and have continued to aim to amplify divisions among Americans across ethnic and religious lines.\n\nIn June 2024, Microsoft observed an Iranian actor tracked as Mint Sandstorm compromised a personal account linked to a U.S. political operative. Mint Sandstorm used this access to the political operative\u2019s account to conduct a spear phishing attack on a staff member at a U.S. presidential campaign. Microsoft products automatically detected and blocked this phishing email. Microsoft took additional steps to notify the political operative and the campaign of this activity. Last month, Microsoft detected that Mint Sandstorm compromised additional personal accounts belonging to individuals linked to a U.S. presidential candidate. Microsoft quickly took action to notify these users and assist them in securing their accounts. We expect the pace and persistence of Iran\u2019s cyberattacks and social media provocations will quicken as Election Day approaches in November.\n\nIran has a history of targeting voters in U.S. swing states. In 2020, an IRGC-directed group, Cotton Sandstorm, posed as the right-wing \u201cProud Boys\u201d to stoke discord in the U.S. over purportedly fake votes. Using a Proud Boys-named email, Cotton Sandstorm sent emails to Florida residents warning them to \u201cvote for Trump or else!\u201d1 Cotton Sandstorm\u2019s cyber activity ahead of the operation included scanning of at least one government organization in Florida.\n\nIn 2022, ahead of the midterm elections, Microsoft detected Mint Sandstorm targeting county-level government organizations in a few states, a pair of which were tightly contested states in 2020. Similarly, in 2024, we\u2019ve observed another group operating on the IRGC\u2019s behalf, Peach Sandstorm, successfully access an account at a county government in a tightly contested swing state.\n\nWe do not know if the IRGC\u2019s targeting of swing states in 2022 or 2024 was election related; in fact, Peach Sandstorm\u2019s targeting was part of a large-scale password spray operation. That said, Iran appears to have demonstrated an interest in U.S. swing states for potential follow-on operations similar to the one ahead of the 2020 elections that sought to sow discord on our electoral process.\n\nRussia\n\nRussian threat actors, the most notable adversary in previous U.S. election cycles, currently are spoofing reputable media outlets and distributing staged videos to spread the Kremlin\u2019s preferred messages to U.S. voters online. In some cases, these campaigns gain a significant number of views and sizeable reach among U.S. and international audiences.\n\nFor example, in early May, Microsoft observed a Russia-affiliated influence actor we track as Storm-1516 disseminate a staged video that claimed to show Ukrainian soldiers burning an effigy of former President Trump. The fake video received some international press, which inaccurately covered the video as genuinely originating from Ukraine. The video was reposted across social media and received several million impressions.\n\nLater, after Vice President Harris joined the presidential race, our team saw Storm-1516 pivot its campaigns. In a second video staged in a Storm-1516 operation in late August, several people who are depicted as Harris supporters are shown assaulting an alleged supporter of former President Trump. This video received at least five million impressions. In a third staged video released earlier this month, Storm-1516 falsely claimed that Harris was involved in a hit-and-run incident. This video similarly gained significant engagement, the original video reportedly receiving more than two million views in the week following its release.[4]\n\nWe also anticipate that Russian cyber proxies, which disrupted U.S. election websites during the 2022 midterms,[5] may seek to use similar tactics on Election Day in November 2024. In addition to the Russian cyber proxy \u201cRaHDit,\u201d which the U.S. State Department recently revealed as led by Russian intelligence,[6] Microsoft tracks nearly a dozen Russian cyber proxies that regularly use rudimentary cyberattacks to stoke fear in election and government security on social media.\n\nIn our August 9 elections report, we revealed a Russian actor that we track as Volga Flood (also known as Rybar) and their efforts to infiltrate U.S. audiences by posing as local activists.[7] Volga Flood created multiple social media accounts called \u201cTexasvsUSA.\u201d The accounts post inflammatory content about immigration at the Southern border and call for mobilization and violence. This month, we\u2019ve seen Volga Flood shift its focus to the Harris-Walz campaign, posting two deceptively edited videos of Vice President Harris on social media.\n\nVolga Flood is publicly positioned as an anonymous military blogger covering the war in Ukraine. In reality, however, Volga Flood is a media enterprise employing dozens of people and headed by EU-sanctioned Russian national Mikhail Zvinchuk. Volga Flood\u2019s media enterprise is divided across multiple teams that include monitoring, regional analytics, illustration, video, foreign languages, and geospatial mapping\u2014all to fulfill its mission statement of waging information warfare on behalf of the Kremlin. Volga Flood publishes analyses through dozens of social media brands and establishes and runs covert social media accounts.\n\nTwo additional Russian actors MTAC tracks have largely focused on European audiences but at times shift to U.S. electoral influence. Since March 2022, we have seen the Russian threat actor we track as Ruza Flood, known internationally as \u201cDoppelganger,\u201d attempt to undermine U.S. politics. Ruza Flood receives significant resourcing and direction from the Russian Presidential Administration.[8] The U.S. Justice Department, in its September 4 announcements, revealed Ruza Flood\u2019s efforts to influence the U.S. citizenry through projects like the \u201cGood Old USA Project,\u201d \u201cThe Guerilla Media Campaign,\u201d and the \u201cU.S. Social Media Influencers Network Project.\u201d[9]\n\nFinally, Storm-1679, a Russian influence actor previously focused on malign influence operations targeting the 2024 Paris Olympic Games, has recently shifted its focus to the U.S. presidential election.[10] Storm-1679 routinely creates videos masquerading as reputable news services or impersonating international intelligence agencies, including France\u2019s DGSI and the U.S.\u2019s CIA. Storm-1679 recently pivoted to creating videos sowing conspiracies about Vice President Harris, which the actor distributes across a range of social media platforms.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s current tracking of current Russian influence operations targeting elections extends beyond the U.S. presidential election. We are also seeing efforts to influence the upcoming Moldovan presidential election and EU referendum on October 20, 2024. In Moldova, a longstanding target of Russian strategic influence campaigns, we currently observe pro-Kremlin proxy activity aimed at achieving Moscow\u2019s goal of destabilizing democratic institutions and undermining pro-EU sentiment. We and others expect Russia will leverage an array of techniques in Moldova: political influence, electoral interference, cyberattacks, sabotage, and cyber-enabled influence campaigns that promote pro-Kremlin political parties and denigrate the current Moldovan leadership.\n\nMicrosoft is working in collaboration with the Moldovan government and others to assist in identifying and defending against Russian cyber and influence operations seeking to influence the outcome of these two elections.\n\nChina\n\nChinese actors\u2019 election efforts are more extensive in 2024 than in previous U.S. election cycles. We observe Chinese influence actors spreading politically charged content over covert social media networks, pretending to be U.S. voters and polling Americans on divisive social issues. Chinese actors have also posed as student protestors online, seeking to stoke division over conflict in the Middle East. These fake accounts\u2014masquerading largely as U.S. conservative voters but also a handful of progressive personas as well\u2014frequently ask their followers whether they agree with a political topic or political candidate. This tactic may be for reconnaissance purposes to better understand how Americans view nuanced political issues.\n\nThis messaging style may also be part of a broader engagement strategy: Over the past year, these China-linked personas have conducted more tailored audience engagement than observed previously, replying to comments, tagging politicians and political commentators, and creating online groups with likeminded voters. Their content strategy has shifted as well. Rather than producing original infographics and memes that largely failed to resonate with U.S. voters in the past cycle, these personas are creating simple short-form videos taken and edited from mainstream news media. Clips denigrating the Biden administration have successfully reached hundreds of thousands of views.\n\nIn July 2024, Microsoft responded to a cyberattack on an organization supporting the upcoming U.S. presidential election. Microsoft worked to remediate and secure the organization\u2019s infrastructure. Subsequent investigation and analysis has attributed this attack to a state affiliated actor based in China.\n\nThese examples, as well as others, underscore the ways in which Iranian, Russian, and Chinese influence actors may seek in the next two months to use social divisions and digital technology to further divide Americans and sow discord ahead of this November\u2019s election. We also need to be vigilant in combatting the risk that nation-state adversaries will seek to conduct cyberattacks directly on key American entities that play critical roles in these elections. More information on these actors can be found in our most recent MTAC report.\n\nDeceptive use of synthetic media (deepfakes)\n\nAI is a tool among many tools that adversaries may opt to leverage as part of a broader cyber influence campaign. As we have navigated through the numerous global elections this year, the emergence of AI as a means for interference has presented itself so far this year as less impactful than many had feared. We recognize, however, that determined and advanced actors will continue to explore new tactics and techniques to target democratic countries, which will include additional and improved use of AI over time.\n\nThough we have not, to date, seen impactful use of AI to influence or interfere in the U.S. election cycle, we do not know what is planned for the coming 48 days, and therefore we will continue to be vigilant in our protections and mitigations, against threats both traditional and novel.\n\nAs a leading technology company heavily invested in AI, we recognize our important responsibility to implement proactive measures to counter these risks. This includes developing robust frameworks for detecting and responding to deceptive AI election content, enhancing transparency within AI applications, and fostering international collaboration to protect the democratic process. The future of our elections depends on our collective ability to utilize AI responsibly and ethically.\n\nIn response to these challenges, we have taken significant steps, including joining together with twenty-seven of the world\u2019s largest technology companies this year to sign the Tech Accord to Combat Deceptive Use of AI in 2024 Elections.[11] This accord addresses abusive AI-generated content through eight specific commitments, categorized into three pillars: Addressing Deepfake Creation, Detecting and Responding to Deepfakes, and Transparency and Resilience. It represents one of the important steps the tech sector has taken this year to protect our elections, and we appreciate the encouragement and support of this Committee to be more proactive, including through Chairman Warner\u2019s presence and voice at the launch of this accord at the Munich Security Conference in February.\n\nHere are some updates on how Microsoft is directly responding to these threats and upholding our joint commitments:\n\nAddressing Deepfake Creation\n\nWe recognize that companies whose products are used to create AI generated content have a responsibility to ensure images and videos generated from their systems include indicators of their origin. One way to accomplish this is through content provenance, enabled by an open standard created by the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA).[12] Microsoft is a founding member of C2PA and has leveraged this standard (\u201ccontent credentials\u201d) across several of our products, ensuring that AI generated content is marked and readable.\n\nSpecifically, Microsoft has added content credentials to all images created with our most popular consumer facing AI image generation tools, including Bing Image Creator, Microsoft Designer, Copilot, and in our enterprise API image generation tools via Azure OpenAI. We recently started testing a content credentials display in Word. When images with content credentials are inserted into Word documents, future viewers will be able to right click and see the credits and author information of these images. In addition, C2PA tagged content is starting to be automatically labeled on LinkedIn.[13] The first place you\u2019ll see the content credentials icon is on the LinkedIn feed, and we\u2019ll work to expand our coverage to additional surfaces.\n\nAs important as it is to mark content as AI generated, a healthy information ecosystem relies on other indicators of authenticity as well. This is why in April we announced[14] the creation of a pilot program that allows political campaigns in the U.S. and the EU, as well as elections authorities and select news media organizations globally, to access a tool that enables them to easily apply content provenance standards to their own authentic images and videos.\n\nWe also joined forces with fellow Tech Accord signatory, TruePic[15] to release an app that simplifies the process for participants in the pilot. This app has now launched for both Android and Apple devices and can be used by those enrolled in Content Credentials program.\n\nDetecting and Responding to Deepfakes\n\nMicrosoft is harnessing the data science and technical capabilities of our AI for Good Lab and MTAC teams to better assess whether abusive content\u2014including that created and disseminated by foreign actors\u2014is synthetic or not. Microsoft\u2019s AI for Good lab has developed and is using detection models (image, video) to assess whether media was generated or manipulated by AI. The model is trained on approximately 200,000 examples of AI and real content. The Lab continues to invest in creating sample datasets representing the latest generative AI technology. When appropriate, we call on the expertise of Microsoft\u2019s Digital Crimes Unit to operationalize the early detection of AI-powered criminal activity and respond fittingly, including through the filing of affirmative civil actions to disrupt and deter that activity and through threat intelligence programs and data sharing with customers and governments.\n\nTo build on the work of our AI for Good lab, in April we announced[16] that we were joining up with AI researcher, Oren Etzioni[17] and his new non-profit, True Media.[18] True Media provides governments, civil society and journalists with access to free tools that enable them to check whether an image or video was AI generated and/or manipulated. Microsoft\u2019s contribution includes providing True Media with access to Microsoft classifiers, tools, personnel, and data. These contributions will enable True Media to train AI detection models, share relevant data, evaluate and refine new detection models as well as provide feedback on quality and classification methodologies.\n\nWe are also empowering candidates, campaigns and election authorities to help us detect and respond to deceptive AI that is targeting elections. In February we launched the Microsoft-2024 Elections site[19] where candidates in a national or federal election can directly report deceptive AI election content on Microsoft consumer services. This reporting tool allows for 24/7 reporting by impacted election entities who have been targeted by deceptive AI found on Microsoft platforms.\n\nTransparency and Resilience\n\nIn advance of the EU elections this summer, we kicked off a global effort to engage campaigns and elections authorities. This enabled us to deepen understanding of the possible risks of deceptive AI in elections and empower those campaigns and election officials to speak directly to their voters about these risks and the steps they can take to build resilience and increase confidence in the election. So far this year we have conducted more than 150 training sessions for political stakeholders in 23 countries, reaching more than 4,700 participants. This included training and public educations sessions at the Republican and Democratic National Conventions, as well as with state party chairpersons for both major political parties in the United States.\n\nBuilding on this training, Microsoft also ran public awareness campaigns in the EU ahead of the EU Parliamentary elections, [20] as well as in France [21] and the UK [22] ahead of their national elections. We are now pursuing similar work in the United States ahead of the November general election. This campaign, which is entitled \u201cCheck, Recheck, Vote,\u201d educates voters of the possible risks posed by deepfakes and empowers them to take steps to identify trusted sources of election information, look for indicators of trust like content provenance, and pause before they link to or share election content. This includes our \u2018Real or Not?\u2019 Quiz, developed by our AI for Good lab to expose users to the challenges of detecting a possible deepfake. So far, individuals from 177 countries have taken the quiz.\n\nOverall, our public awareness campaigns outside the United States have reached more than 350 million people, driving almost three million engagements worldwide. Our U.S. Public Awareness campaign [23] has just begun and already has reached over six million people with over 30,000 engagements.\n\nIn May, we announced a series of societal resilience grants in partnership with OpenAI.[24] Grants delivered from the partnership have equipped several organizations, including Older Adults Technology Services (OATS) from AARP, International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (International IDEA), C2PA, and Partnership on AI (PAI) to deliver AI education and trainings that illuminate the potential of AI while also teaching how to use AI safely and mitigate against the harms of deceptive AI-content.\n\nProtecting Campaign and Election Infrastructure\n\nSince the 2016 election, adversaries have regularly targeted essential systems that support elections and campaigns in the U.S. to advance their cyber enabled influence operations. As mentioned earlier, recent Iranian hacking incidents involved attempts by these actors to provide stolen or allegedly stolen material to the media to propagate narratives of dissent and distrust. This underscores why we continue to invest in efforts that focus on safeguarding the critical infrastructure that underpins our elections.\n\nOur efforts include several initiatives designed to support election officials and political organizations. First, we offer AccountGuard, a no-cost cybersecurity service available to our cloud email customers in 35 countries. This service provides advanced threat detection and notifications against nation-state adversaries for high-risk customers, including those involved in elections. AccountGuard extends beyond commercial customers to individuals at election organizations, their affiliates, and immediate family members who may use personal Microsoft accounts for email. We have observed that sophisticated adversaries often target both professional and personal accounts, amplifying the need for comprehensive protection. More than 5.4 million mailboxes of high-risk users are now protected by AccountGuard globally.\n\nAdditionally, our Election Security Advisors program provides federal political campaigns and state election departments with expert security consultation. This includes proactive security assessments or forensic investigations in the event of a cyber incident. Our goal is to ensure that these entities have the necessary support to maintain the integrity of their operations.\n\nFor critical election-adjacent systems, such as voter registration databases and voter information portals, we provide our Azure for Election service. This service provides proactive security reviews, resilience assessments, and load analysis. During the election week, we offer our highest tier of reactive support to address any security or availability issues that may arise. Since offering this service from 2018 to today, we have assisted more than half of U.S. states, including many counties and cities, in reviewing their election IT infrastructure.\n\nIn preparation for the election this November, we are also establishing a situation room staffed by our team to provide constant management and triage of any election-sensitive issues and maintain real-time communications with other situations rooms across our industry partners. This ensures that any incidents receive the highest level of priority and executive support.\n\nWhile we continue to provide robust security services, we recognize that collaboration is essential. Public-private partnerships are crucial in strengthening the entire ecosystem. Our Democracy Forward team actively participates in tabletop cybersecurity training exercises with U.S. election officials at both national and state/county levels.\n\nMicrosoft remains steadfast in its commitment to supporting the security and integrity of democratic processes. Through our comprehensive programs and collaborative efforts, we aim to protect democracy from the evolving threats posed by nation-state actors.\n\nPolicy Recommendations\n\nFinally, we find ourselves at a moment in history when anyone with access to the Internet can use AI tools to create a highly realistic piece of synthetic media that can be used to deceive: a voice clone of a family member, a deepfake image of a political candidate, or even a doctored government document. AI has made manipulating media significantly easier, quicker, more accessible, and requiring little skill. As swiftly as AI technology has become a tool, it has become a weapon.\n\nI want to acknowledge and thank this Committee for its longstanding leadership on these important issues. We particularly commend the efforts reflected in section 511 of the SSCI FY 25 Intelligence Authorization Act (IAA), which focuses on protecting technological measures designed to verify the authenticity and provenance of machine-manipulated media. These protections are essential as technology companies strive to provide users with reliable information about the origins of AI generated content.\n\nWe are also encouraged and supportive of the recent agreement by the Federal Election Commission (FEC)[25] applying existing restrictions regarding fraudulent misrepresentation to campaigns use of AI technology. Existing robocall provisions are another means of addressing the fraudulent use of synthetic content. These provisions have historically restricted the use of artificial or prerecorded voices and allow for enforcement actions when these rules are violated.\n\nAlong those lines, it is worth mentioning three ideas that may have an outsized impact in the future fights against deceptive and abusive AI-generated content.\n\nFirst, Congress should enact a new federal \u201cdeepfake fraud statute.\u201d We need to give law enforcement officials, including state attorneys general, a standalone legal framework to prosecute AI-generated fraud and scams as they proliferate in speed and complexity.\n\nSecond, Congress should require AI system providers to use state-of-the-art provenance tooling to label synthetic content. This is essential to build trust in the information ecosystem and will help the public better understand whether content is AI-generated or manipulated.\n\nThird, Congress should pass the bipartisan Protect Elections from Deceptive AI Act, sponsored by Senators Klobuchar, Hawley, Coons, and Collins. This important piece of legislation prohibits the use of AI to generate materially deceptive content falsely depicting federal candidates in political ads to influence federal elections, with important exceptions for parody, satire, and the use of AI-generated content by newsrooms. Such legislation is needed to ensure that bad actors cannot exploit ambiguities in current law to create and distribute deceptive content, and to ensure that candidates for federal office have meaningful recourse if they are the victim of such attacks. Several states have proposed or passed legislation similar to this federal proposal. While the language in these bills varies, we recommend states adopt prohibitions or disclosure requirements on \u201cmaterially deceptive\u201d AI-generated ads or something akin to that language and that the bills contain exceptions for First Amendment purposes.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, we recognize that the protection of electoral integrity and public trust is a shared responsibility and a common good that transcends partisan interests and national borders.\n\nThis must be our guiding principle.\n\nLooking ahead, we believe that new forms of multistakeholder action are essential. Initiatives like the Paris Call and Christchurch Call have demonstrated positive global impacts by uniting representatives from governments, the tech sector, and civil society. In addressing the challenges posed by deepfakes and other technological issues, it is evident that no single sector of society can solve these complex problems in isolation. Collaboration is crucial to preserving our timeless values and democratic principles amidst rapid technological change.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to answering any questions you may have.\n\n[1] Treasury Takes Action as Part of a U.S. Government Response to Russia\u2019s Foreign Malign Influence Operations | U.S. Department of the Treasury\n\n[2] Office of Public Affairs | Justice Department Disrupts Covert Russian Government-Sponsored Foreign Malign Influence Operation Targeting Audiences in the United States and Elsewhere | United States Department of Justice\n\n[3] Iran Targeting 2024 US Election \u2013 Microsoft On the Issues\n\n[4] https://uk.news.yahoo.com/russia-spread-fake-rumour-kamala-153333198.html\n\n[5] https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/11/08/2022-midterm-websites-mississippi-hit-cyber-attack/8308615001/\n\n[6] https://www.state.gov/u-s-department-of-state-takes-actions-to-counter-russian-influence-and-interference-in-u-s-elections\n\n[7] https://cdn-dynmedia-1.microsoft.com/is/content/microsoftcorp/microsoft/final/en-us/microsoft-brand/documents/5bc57431-a7a9-49ad-944d-b93b7d35d0fc.pdf\n\n[8]https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1366261/dl\n\n[9] https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-disrupts-covert-russian-government-sponsored-foreign-malign-influence\n\n[10] https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2024/06/02/russia-cyber-bots-disinformation-2024-paris-olympics/\n\n[11] AI Elections accord \u2013 A Tech accord to Combat Deceptive Use of AI in 2024 Elections\n\n[12] Overview \u2013 C2PA\n\n[13] (1) LinkedIn Adopts C2PA Standard | LinkedIn\n\n[14] Expanding our Content Integrity tools to support global elections \u2013 Microsoft On the Issues\n\n[15] Truepic\u2019s Secure Camera Enhances Microsoft\u2019s Content Integrity Tools \u2013 Truepic\n\n[16] TrueMedia.org to Enhance Deepfake Detection Capabilities \u00b7 TrueMedia\n\n[17] An A.I.

Both candidates, however, have higher unfavorable than favorable ratings. Trump\u2019s unfavorable rating is seven percentage points higher than his favorable score, and Harris\u2019 is 10 points higher.\n\nHarris\u2019 bump in favorability after her unexpected nomination as the Democratic presidential nominee has moderated somewhat, while Trump\u2019s favorability is up five points since last month, returning to the level he was at in June.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nDespite the overall negative tilt in favorability, both candidates enjoy nearly unanimous positive ratings from their own party faithful and negligible positivity from the opposing party. While majorities of independents view Trump and Harris unfavorably, the former president holds a favorability edge over the current vice president with the group -- 44% vs. 35%, respectively.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nPresidential Candidates\u2019 Favorability Below 50% for Third Consecutive Cycle\n\nIn the six consecutive presidential cycles starting in 1992, at least one of the candidates, and often both, received positive ratings from a majority of Americans in September of the election year and up until the election. However, since 2016 -- when Trump and Hillary Clinton were the least favorably viewed presidential candidates in the history of Gallup polling -- less than half of U.S. adults have rated the candidates positively in the summer and fall of the election year.\n\nTrump is currently viewed better than he was at a similar point in the 2020 and 2016 campaigns, while Harris\u2019 positive rating is on par with Biden\u2019s in 2020 and well above Clinton\u2019s in 2016. Beyond Trump, Clinton and Biden, only George H.W. Bush in 1992 and Mitt Romney in 2012 earned a favorable score of less than 50%.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nVice Presidential Candidates Still Unknown to About One in Five Americans\n\nThe vice presidential candidates\u2019 favorable ratings are not yet as concrete as their running mates\u2019 are. About one in five U.S. adults do not yet have an opinion of Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (19%) or Republican Ohio U.S. Sen. JD Vance (17%). While Vance\u2019s unfavorable rating (47%) outpaces his favorable rating (36%), Walz is viewed favorably (41%) and unfavorably (40%) by roughly equal shares of Americans.\n\nBoth vice presidential candidates receive largely favorable scores from their party base -- 79% of Democrats rate Walz positively, and 74% of Republicans have a favorable view of Vance. Independents have a more favorable opinion of Walz (37%) than Vance (30%), and this group is the most likely to say they have not yet formed an opinion of the presidential candidates\u2019 running mates.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nThe overall favorable ratings for Walz and Vance are in line with those of other vice presidential candidates at a similar point in the campaign since 2012. Prior to 2012, favorable ratings of the presidential running mates in August or early September were generally higher, with at least one of the candidates garnering majority-level favorability.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nJob Approval Ratings of Harris and Biden Down Slightly\n\nThe vice president\u2019s current job approval rating matches her favorable rating, with 44% of Americans saying they approve. Last month, her approval rating was 47%. Harris\u2019 current approval rating is 95% among Democrats, 38% among independents and 2% among Republicans.\n\nAfter giving up his bid for the presidency in July, President Joe Biden enjoyed a boost in his approval rating to 43% last month -- which has slipped to 39%, not far from the 36% taken in the weeks leading up to his announcement that he would not seek reelection.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nDemocrats\u2019 rating of Biden is 85%, independents\u2019 is 31% and Republicans\u2019 is 3%.\n\nBottom Line\n\nBoth presidential candidates continue to be viewed unfavorably by majorities of Americans. Should those evaluations hold through the end of the campaign, it would mark the third consecutive presidential campaign in which neither candidate garnered majority-level favorable ratings from the public. In most cases since 1992, when one of the presidential candidates was viewed significantly more favorably than the other, the higher-rated candidate won. The current similarity between Trump\u2019s and Harris\u2019 favorable ratings may be a sign of a tight race.\n\nTo stay up to date with the latest Gallup News insights and updates, follow us on X @Gallup.\n\nExplore President Biden's approval ratings and compare them with those of past presidents in the Gallup Presidential Job Approval Center.\n\nLearn more about how the Gallup Poll Social Series works.\n\nView complete question responses and trends (PDF download).\n\n###Embeddable###",

For 178 years, The Associated Press has played a vital role in U.S. elections, counting the vote and declaring the winners \u2013 and reporting them to the world, without fear or favor.\n\nWith a history of accuracy dating to our first vote count in 1848, AP remains the go-to source for trustworthy and reliable information every election night.\n\nSenior Vice President and Executive Editor Julie Pace explains why AP calls U.S. elections and the preparations underway as Election Day approaches:\n\nWhy does AP call U.S. elections in the first place?\n\nElections in the United States are administered at the state and local level. That means there is no federal body that counts the vote or shares results. The AP stepped in to help fill that void more than 170 years ago, shortly after our founding. The goal was to ensure the public had an independent, non-partisan source of information on elections \u2013 and that\u2019s the role AP continues to play, nearly two centuries later.\n\nBusy scene at the offices of The Associated Press in New York as tabulators gather to count the vote, which arrived by telegraph, Nov. 3, 1914. (AP Photo).\n\nWhat is AP doing to prepare for the 2024 elections? How is the process similar \u2013 or different \u2013 compared to 2020?\n\nThe fundamentals of our approach to the 2024 election are unchanged. Our priority is ensuring we\u2019re well-positioned to declare winners in races up and down the ballot with speed, and of course, accuracy. Our decision team has had plenty of practice this year during the busy primary season, which has helped them fine tune their workflows, communication and modeling. As Election Day nears, they\u2019re paying particular attention to the battleground states in the presidential race and competitive House and Senate contests, ensuring we\u2019re up to speed on any changes in voting rules and procedures in those locations.\n\nWe\u2019re also placing a particular emphasis in 2024 on our explanatory journalism around our race calls and vote count. We plan to be more transparent than ever about how we\u2019ve called key races, which is part of our effort to help build public confidence in election results. We know that the process can be confusing, so we think it\u2019s important to show people what went into our decisions. We\u2019ve also significantly expanded our data visualization around elections, which will provide audiences with an immersive digital experience on Election Day and beyond.\n\nWhy should people trust AP to get it right?\n\nNo news organization has been calling elections longer than the AP. That depth of experience, combined with our gold standard record of accuracy and our non-partisan approach to news coverage should give the public confidence in our race calls. Our motivations are simple: we want to get the calls right and we want to inform the public quickly. We have no political agenda or rooting interest in the outcome of the elections. We are focused on the facts and delivering the results accurately.",

But starting in August, influence campaigns the company has been tracking began to churn out content about Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"The shift to focusing on the Harris-Walz campaign reflects a strategic move by Russian actors aimed at exploiting any perceived vulnerabilities in the new candidates,\" Clint Watts, the general manager of the Threat Analysis Center, wrote in a blog post accompanying the report.\n\nIn recent weeks, the U.S. government has stepped up its efforts to call out and disrupt Russian influence operations targeting American voters that intelligence officials say are aimed at helping former President Donald Trump regain the White House.\n\nThe Microsoft report identified a number of recent Russia-linked campaigns that have shifted focus to Harris. That included a baseless claim accusing Harris of being involved in a hit-and-run in 2011 that was spread via a website claiming to be a local San Francisco TV station. The article was accompanied by a video in which a woman, whom Microsoft identified as an actor, claimed to be the victim of the crash. There is no evidence any such incident occurred, and the purported TV station does not exist.\n\nMicrosoft said the video and its laundering through a sham news site was consistent with the tactics of an influence operation it has tracked in previous reports. Researchers at the misinformation-tracking company NewsGuard have linked that operation to a former deputy sheriff from Florida who now lives in Moscow.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAnother inauthentic video Microsoft attributed to the same operation appeared to depict \"an attack by alleged Harris supporters on what the video\u2019s amplifiers claim is a Trump rally attendee.\" It racked up millions of views.\n\nMicrosoft attributed other videos pushing conspiracy theories and falsehoods about Harris\u2019s policies to a separate Russian influence operation that previously aimed to spread fear around the Paris Olympics.\n\nOne video, purporting to show a fake billboard in Times Square with false claims about Harris, was posted on a Telegram channel that claimed the phone message was commissioned by Trump supporters \"to troll the Democrats.\" It was viewed more than 100,000 times on the social media site X, formerly Twitter, within four hours of being posted on Telegram, Microsoft said.\n\nA third influence campaign noted in the report \"continues to operate covert social media channels that target US audiences.\" It amplifies materials obtained by Russian-linked hackers and posts fake investigations, alongside attacks on Harris and posts about the U.S. southern border.\n\nThe operations will likely ramp up their attacks on the Harris-Walz campaign in the run-up to Election Day, Microsoft said.\n\nIran and China are also seeking to sway U.S. voters, Microsoft said, echoing assessments by federal intelligence officials and researchers at other companies.",

        "text": "China\u2019s influence campaign intensifies as US election nears\nAt first glance, Noah R. Smith might seem like your typical social media user. His bio says he\u2019s a father, a former \u201cTrack and Field representative,\u201d and a current member of the PanAm Sports organization.\n\nOn July 14, a day after the first assassination attempt on Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, Smith shared three posts from an account named \u201cTRUMP WON.\u201d\n\nOne post declared, \u201cAMERICA was attacked today \u2026 we must get it together. It\u2019s literally a matter of life and death,\u201d accompanied by an image depicting a divine hand halting a bullet aimed at Trump.\n\nAnother post urged \u201call MAGA GOD Fearing Patriots\u201d to connect, stating, \u201cGrow These Accounts, UNITED We Are Strong.\u201d\n\nWhile it might seem that Smith is a devoted Trump supporter, closer inspection suggests otherwise. His cover photo features Chinese watermarks, his profile picture is sourced from a company that provides photos, videos and music, and his bio is lifted from an authentic account named Laurel R. Smith.\n\nIn reality, Noah R. Smith is impersonating a U.S. voter who supports Trump. A joint investigation by VOA Mandarin and Doublethink Lab (DTL), a Taiwanese social media analytics firm, uncovered 10 such accounts on X.\n\nThese accounts are linked to China\u2019s Spamouflage network \u2014 a state-sponsored operation aimed at supporting the Chinese government and undermining its critics. This network was first identified by social media analytics company Graphika in 2019 and was used to target Hong Kong pro-democracy protesters at that time.\n\nFollowing the assassination attempt on July 14, the accounts began promoting pro-Trump content. Previously, they shared material consistent with Spamouflage\u2019s broader interests: defending China, criticizing U.S. foreign policy, and exploiting divisive domestic issues such as gun violence and racial tensions.\n\nDTL labeled this network of accounts posing as Americans \u201cMAGAflage 1,\u201d because they all seem to be promoting Trump\u2019s slogan \u201cMake America Great Again [MAGA].\u201d\n\n\u201cThe MAGAflage accounts are different because they are not just criticizing stuff. They are amplifying positive content about Trump,\u201d Jasper Hewitt, a digital intelligence analyst at Doublethink Lab, told VOA Mandarin.\n\nHe added that it\u2019s too early to draw conclusions about whom China is supporting, as researchers are still tracking accounts that criticize both Republican candidate Donald Trump and Democratic candidate Kamala Harris.\n\n\u201cEngaging with the MAGA movement, or any part of the political spectrum, might merely be a new attempt to generate authentic traffic,\u201d Hewitt told VOA.\n\nThe first MAGAflage network was discovered by Elise Thomas, a senior analyst at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, in April 2024. This network focuses on promoting positive content of Trump. She told VOA earlier that by wrapping a topic in a U.S. partisan political frame, these accounts got \u201ca reasonable amount of engagement from real American users.\u201d\n\nLimited influence\n\nThe VOA Mandarin investigation revealed that the accounts operate in coordination. Six out of the 10 accounts were created in 2015 but had their first visible posts on May 18 or May 19, 2022.\n\nThe batch accounts \u2014 the 10 new accounts \u2014 are not very active. Each account has roughly 100 posts or reposts over the last two years. The batch accounts were inactive for one year but were awoken after the first Trump assassination attempt.\n\nAdditionally, these accounts occasionally post or repost Chinese content.\n\nFor example, an account named Super-Rabbit shared praise for China's political and economic model from state-linked influencers like Shanghai Panda and Xinhua News Agency\u2019s reporter Li Zexin. One post from September 3 contrasted U.S. President Joe Biden\u2019s inactivity with China\u2019s President Xi Jinping\u2019s engagement in Africa.\n\n\u201cWhen Joe Biden is sitting on the beach wasted away, China\u2019s President Xi is shaking hands with various African leaders and making a better impact in Africa,\u201d the post said.\n\nVOA contacted the Trump and Harris campaigns for comment but did not receive a response as of publication time.\n\nLiu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, told VOA in a statement that \u201cChina has no intention and will not interfere in the U.S. election, and we hope that the U.S. side will not make an issue of China in the election.\u201d\n\nSo far, the newly discovered MAGAflage 1 accounts have had limited influence, with only a handful of followers and minimal interactions.\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies issued their latest assessment earlier this month, warning that Russia, Iran, and China are intensifying efforts to influence the U.S. presidential election.\n\nWhile Russia remains the primary concern, officials noted that Chinese online influence actors have \u201ccontinued small scale efforts on social media to engage U.S. audiences on divisive political issues, including protests about the Israel-Gaza conflict and promote negative stories about both political parties.\u201d",

        "text": "September 18, 2024, presidential campaign news\nFormer President Donald Trump on Tuesday said he will meet with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi next week and labeled India a \u201cvery big abuser\u201d when it comes to trade with the United States as he spoke about his vision for a reciprocal trade policy.\n\n\u201cHe happens to be coming to meet me next week, and Modi, he\u2019s fantastic. I mean, fantastic man. These, a lot of these a lot of these leaders are fantastic,\u201d he said, speaking at a town hall in Flint, Michigan, on Tuesday evening moderated by Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders.\n\nTrump added that countries like India, Brazil and China are \u201cat the top of their game and they use it against us.\u201d\n\nMichigan voters were able to ask questions at the town hall, all of which teed up Trump to talk about his policy promises. When a retired nurse asked how he would bring down the price of food and groceries, Trump said, \u201cWe have to start always with energy,\u201d pledging to bring down Americans\u2019 energy bills by 50% within his first year if elected.\n\n\u201cInterest rates are going to follow,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cactually they\u2019re going to follow for another reason.\u201d\n\nTrump also referenced an expected interest rate cut announcement from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe economy is now not good, and interest rates, you\u2019ll see they\u2019ll do the rate cut and all the political stuff tomorrow, I think. And you know, will he do a half a point? Will he do a quarter of a point? But the reason is because the economy is not good. Otherwise, you wouldn\u2019t be able to do it,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump also acknowledged his rambling speaking style and pushed back on Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 jab during last week\u2019s debate that people leave during his rallies.\n\n\u201cYou know, when she said that, well, your rallies, people leave. Honestly, nobody does. And if I saw them leaving, I\u2019d say, and ladies and gentlemen, make America great again, now get the hell out. OK, because I don\u2019t want people leaving,\u201d Trump told a hockey arena full of supporters in Flint, Michigan.\n\nLast week in Philadelphia, Harris said people leave Trump\u2019s rallies early \u201cout of exhaustion and boredom,\u201d which prompted Trump to defend his campaign events and then pivot to making false claims about immigrants eating pets in Ohio.\n\nTrump acknowledged to the Michigan crowd that he uses \u201clong, sometimes very complex sentences and paragraphs,\u201d but he said \u201cthey come all together.\u201d",

Therefore, it was hardly a surprise when Eminem\u2019s performance at the 2020 Oscars (he won an Academy Award for it in 2003) was considered a post-modern musical classic.The entire audience, many of whom had grown up listening to Marshall Mathers\u2019 songs, were in absolute awe. However, there was one gentleman in the audience who was not impressed at all: the legendary director Martin Scorsese . While his neighbours sang along, Scorsese sat stone-faced, as if he had been forced to sit through an MCU marathon while strapped to a rollercoaster.It\u2019s a sentiment that a lot of political watchers can probably sympathise with, as the name Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs suddenly dominates the MAGA vs KHive conversation. What exactly is a Sean Combs? Is his name Diddy? And why is he suddenly in the news? How is he connected to Obama, Harris and Trump?As entertainment journalists will tell their political counterparts, Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs is a rapper and business mogul. In the last few days, both the Harris and Trump camps have been trying to link the rapper to their opponent. For the uninitiated, the rapper was recently arrested and accused of operating a criminal enterprise dating back to 2008, involving violence to coerce women into fulfilling his sexual desires.The 14-page indictment charges Combs with racketeering, sex trafficking by force, and transporting individuals for prostitution. If convicted, he faces a potential sentence ranging from 15 years to life in prison. Court documents describe how Combs allegedly leveraged his celebrity status to lure women into extended sexual acts, referred to as \"Freak Offs,\" during which he is accused of distributing controlled substances to ensure their compliance.US prosecutor Damian Williams revealed that, during raids conducted six months ago at Combs\u2019 residences in Miami and Los Angeles, authorities seized firearms, ammunition, and over 1,000 bottles of lubricant. Additionally, three semi-automatic rifles with defaced serial numbers were found, raising the possibility of further charges. Prosecutors, however, allege that Combs orchestrated a criminal enterprise whose members were involved in sex trafficking, forced labour, kidnapping, arson, and bribery.Now both camps are hell-bent on tying Diddy to the other. Diddy\u2019s connection to Kamala Harris emerged during the 2020 presidential campaign, when he hosted a town hall on racial inequality during the COVID-19 pandemic. Harris publicly thanked Diddy via Twitter for his efforts in highlighting racial disparities in healthcare, sparking discussions about their association.Diddy also interviewed Barack Obama in the past, when the future Godfather of the Democratic Party was an aspiring senator from Illinois. In the video, a youthful Obama explains the importance of political representation to Diddy. At that time, there wasn\u2019t a single black senator. Four years later, Obama would become POTUS.In 2016, Diddy expressed some disappointment with Obama after his tenure ended: \u201cMy number one thing, to be honest, is black people \u2013 I feel like we put President Obama in the White House. When I look back, I just wanted more done for my people because that\u2019s the name of the game. This is politics. You put somebody in office, you get in return the things that you care about for your communities. I think we got a little bit short-changed. That\u2019s not knocking the President.\u201dMeanwhile, Diddy and Trump shared a longstanding connection, dating back to the 1990s when both were high-profile businessmen in New York City. Trump once described Diddy as \"legendary\" in an invitation to his 29th birthday party in 1998. Over the years, they were photographed together at several events, reflecting a social relationship between the two. Diddy has mentioned Trump in his lyrics, notably in his 2006 song \"We Gon' Make It,\" where he boasts about having the same kind of wealth as the former president. However, Diddy's view of Trump soured, especially during Trump\u2019s presidency. By 2020, Diddy expressed his disapproval, endorsing Joe Biden and stating that Trump\u2019s thinking was dangerous, and that Trump made life worse for black communities.Meanwhile, here are 10 other developments:",

And even fewer get news on several other sites, including Reddit (8%), Nextdoor (5%), Snapchat (5%), WhatsApp (5%), LinkedIn (4%), Truth Social (3%) and Rumble (2%).\n\nNews consumption by social media site % of U.S. adults who regularly get news on each social media site Source: Survey of U.S. adults conducted July 15-Aug. 4, 2024. PEW RESEARCH CENTER\n\nSome social media sites \u2013 despite having relatively small overall audiences \u2013 stand out as destinations for news among many of their users. For example, 59% of X users get news there, as do a similar share of users on Truth Social (57%), the site owned by former President Donald Trump. On the other hand, only 14% of LinkedIn users regularly get news on that platform.\n\nAbout half of TikTok users (52%) say they regularly get news on the site, up from 43% in 2023 and just 22% in 2020. The share of users who get news also has risen on several other sites, including YouTube and Instagram.\n\nSocial media sites by portion of users who regularly get news there % of each social media site\u2019s users who regularly get news there Source: Survey of U.S. adults conducted July 15-Aug. 4, 2024. PEW RESEARCH CENTER\n\nWho consumes news on each social media site?\n\nThe people who regularly get news on different social media sites often differ by gender, age, political party and other factors. For example, women make up greater portions of regular news consumers on Nextdoor (64%), TikTok (62%), Facebook (60%), Snapchat (60%) and Instagram (59%), while men make up greater shares on Reddit (68%), X (64%), Rumble (60%), Truth Social (58%) and YouTube (57%).\n\nNews consumers on Snapchat, TikTok, Instagram, X and Reddit tend to be younger than those on other sites. Other patterns are unique to individual sites. For instance, 48% of news consumers on WhatsApp are Hispanic \u2013 much higher than on any other site. And LinkedIn has the largest portion of news consumers with a college degree (55%).\n\nThere also are partisan differences among those who regularly get news on some social media sites. Overwhelming shares of regular news consumers on Truth Social (88%) and Rumble (83%) are Republicans or Republican-leaning independents, as are half of those on Facebook and YouTube. On Instagram, WhatsApp, TikTok, Reddit and Nextdoor, news consumers are more likely to be Democrats or Democratic leaners. X news consumers are about evenly divided by party.\n\n(Read the Appendix for data on the demographic and partisan makeup of U.S. adults who regularly get news from each social media site.)\n\nFacebook, YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, X (Twitter), Reddit\n\nNextdoor, Snapchat, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Truth Social, Rumble\n\nFind out more\n\nThis fact sheet was compiled by Research Assistant Christopher St. Aubin and Research Analyst Jacob Liedke.\n\nRead the methodology and the topline.\n\nPew Research Center is a subsidiary of The Pew Charitable Trusts, its primary funder.

        "summary": " Teamsters union declines to endorse in presidential election, breaking decades of precedent . It's the first time in decades that the union hasn't backed a candidate in the presidential election . The union's decision comes two days after senior leaders met with Kamala Harris as they weighed whom to endorse .",
        "text": "Teamsters union declines to endorse in presidential election, breaking decades of precedent\nThe Teamsters on Wednesday declined to endorse a candidate for president, the first time in decades that the union hasn't backed a candidate in the presidential election.\n\n\"Neither major candidate was able to make serious commitments to our union to ensure the interests of working people are always put before Big Business,\" Teamsters General President Sean O'Brien said in a statement.\n\nHe added, \"We sought commitments from both [former president Donald] Trump and [Vice President Kamala] Harris not to interfere in critical union campaigns or core Teamsters industries\u2014and to honor our members\u2019 right to strike\u2014but were unable to secure those pledges.\"\n\nThe union's decision comes two days after senior leaders met with Harris as they weighed whom to endorse.\n\nThe Teamsters, which represents truck drivers, freight workers and others, held similar meetings with Trump and President Joe Biden when he was still seeking re-election.\n\nThe union, which at 1.3 million members is one of the largest in the world, collected input on an endorsement from its members through straw polling and a QR poll from a code printed on a union magazine, a vice president at large of the union, John Palmer, said.\n\nOn Wednesday, the union released the results of its survey, which was conducted after Biden dropped out of the race. It found that almost 60% of rank-and-file union members preferred to endorse Trump, while 34% backed Harris, according to an electronic member poll. A phone poll indicated similar findings, with 58% supporting Trump and 31% supporting Harris.\n\nThe union has not released the number of poll participants or the margin of error.\n\nThe Teamsters have for decades endorsed Democratic presidential candidates. The union supported Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Joe Biden in 2020. It also backed Barack Obama in both of his presidential runs, John Kerry in 2004 and Al Gore in 2000.\n\nIn an email Wednesday, the Trump campaign highlighted the Teamsters polling.\n\n\"While the Teamsters Executive Board is making no formal endorsement, the hardworking members of the Teamsters have been loud and clear\u2014 they want President Trump back in the White House!\" said campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt in a statement. \"These hardworking men and women are the backbone of America and President Trump will strongly stand up for them when he\u2019s back in the White House.\"\n\nTrump told reporters Wednesday that the union's decision not to endorse a candidate was \"a great honor.\"\n\n\"The Teamsters carry a lot of weight. The Democrats cannot believe it,\" Trump said. \"Look, it was always automatic that Democrats get the Teamsters, and they said, 'We won\u2019t endorse the Democrats this year,' so that was an honor for me.\"\n\nHarris campaign spokesperson Lauren Hitt pointed to local Teamsters chapters that endorsed the vice president.\n\n\u201cThe Vice President\u2019s strong union record is why Teamsters locals across the country have already endorsed her \u2014 alongside the overwhelming majority of organized labor,\u201d Hitt said in a statement. \u201cAs the Vice President told the Teamsters on Monday, when she is elected president, she will look out for the Teamsters rank-and-file no matter what \u2014 because they always have been and always will be the people she fights for.\u201d\n\nOver the course of his presidency, Biden has promoted his support for organized labor and has frequently weighed in on disputes between union workers and corporate leaders. In 2021, he expressed support for the right to unionize in a direct-to-camera video as Amazon workers in Alabama were about to vote on whether to organize.\n\nThen-Teamsters President James P. Hoffa in 2021 credited Biden with including an $83 billion pension-fund bailout in the American Rescue Plan Act, which boosted the Teamsters' Central States pension fund.\n\nIn 2023, Biden became the first sitting president to join a picket line when he visited striking autoworkers in Michigan.\n\nBut despite calling himself \u201cthe most pro-union President leading the most pro-union administration in American history,\u201d Biden drew criticism from organized labor two years ago when he worked with Congress to pass a law that averted an impending rail strike.\n\nThe law forced union workers to accept a union contract that had been brokered by the Biden administration. At the time, four of the 12 unions involved had rejected the deal.\n\nAs he signed the legislation, Biden called it \u201ca tough [vote] for me,\u201d but cited the need \u201cto keep the supply chains stable around the holidays.\u201d\n\nThe International Association of Fire Fighters is the most prominent union that has not yet endorsed a presidential candidate this year. The union endorsed Biden in 2020.\n\nThe AFL-CIO, which represents dozens of unions and millions of workers, and the United Auto Workers union have each endorsed Harris.",

        "text": "From panic buttons to bulletproof glass, U.S. election officials are preparing for threats\nMARIETTA, Ga. (AP) \u2014 The election director in Cobb County, an Atlanta suburb where votes will be fiercely contested in this year\u2019s presidential race, recently organized a five-hour training session. The focus wasn\u2019t solely on the nuts-and-bolts of running this year\u2019s election. Instead, it brought together election staff and law enforcement to strategize on how to keep workers safe and the process of voting and ballot-counting secure.\n\nHaving a local sheriff\u2019s deputy at early voting locations and panic buttons that connect poll managers to a local 911 dispatcher are among the added security steps the office is taking this year.\n\nTate Fall, Cobb County\u2019s election director, said she was motivated to act after hearing one of her poll workers describe being confronted during the state\u2019s presidential primary in March by an agitated voter who the worker noticed was carrying a gun. The situation ended peacefully, but the poll worker was shaken.\n\nWATCH: How Wisconsin tests its voting machines to ensure election accuracy\n\n\u201cThat made it really real for me \u2014 that it\u2019s so easy for something to go sideways in life, period, let alone the environment of Georgia and elections,\u201d Fall said. \u201cI just can\u2019t have someone being harmed on my conscience.\u201d\n\nAcross the country, local election directors are beefing up their security in advance of Election Day on Nov. 5 to keep their workers and polling places safe while also ensuring that ballots and voting procedures won\u2019t be tampered with. Their concern isn\u2019t just theoretical. Election offices and those who run them have been targets of harassment and even death threats since the 2020 presidential election, primarily by people acting on former President Donald Trump\u2019s lies that the election was stolen from him through widespread fraud or rigged voting machines.\n\nThe focus on security comes as threats of political violence have been on the rise. Trump was the target of a potential assassination attempt over the weekend, just nine weeks after another threat on his life. Federal agents last year fatally shot a Trump supporter who threatened to assassinate President Joe Biden, and the husband of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was severely injured in a hammer attack by a man promoting right-wing conspiracy theories.\n\nIn just the last year, a gun was fired at a window of the Cuyahoga County, Ohio, election office, several election offices in five states were sent letters filled with a white powder that in some cases tested positive for the powerful opioid fentanyl, and bogus 911 calls were made to the homes of top state election officials in Georgia, Maine, Michigan and Missouri in a potentially dangerous situation known as swatting.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the things that I have to say is just crazy, outrageous to me \u2014 the election threats to workers of both parties and their families, the bullying, the harassment,\u201d Jen Easterly, director of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency, said during a recent agency-sponsored online event. \u201cThese folks, they are not doing it for pay. They\u2019re not doing it for glory. They\u2019re doing it because they believe it\u2019s the right thing to do to defend our democracy.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Postmaster general claims USPS is prepared for flood of mail-in ballots\n\nHer agency has completed more than 1,000 voluntary physical security assessments for election offices since the start of 2023. Election officials have been using that help to identify gaps and request money from their local governments to make upgrades.\n\nThey also have been aided by a U.S. Election Assistance Commission decision in 2022 that allowed certain federal money to go toward security features such as badge readers, cameras and protective fencing.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s Los Angeles County and Durham County, North Carolina, will have new offices with significant security upgrades for this year\u2019s election. They include bulletproof glass, security cameras and doors that open only with badges. Election workers across the country also will have new procedures for handling mail, including kits of Narcan, the nasal spray used for accidental overdoses.\n\nIn Durham County, a central feature of the new office will be a mail processing room with a separate exhaust system to contain potentially hazardous substances sent in the mail.\n\n\u201cWe have countless reasons why this investment was critical,\u201d said the county\u2019s election director, Derek Bowens, pointing to threats against election officials in Michigan and Arizona and the suspicious letters sent to offices in Oregon, Washington, California and Georgia.\n\nBowens and others who have worked in elections for years said their jobs have changed significantly. Threats and harassment are one reason why some election officials across the country have been leaving. In some places, election workers are being trained in de-escalation techniques and how to respond to an active shooter.\n\nWATCH: Another apparent assassination attempt casts shadow on 2024 campaign\n\n\u201cSecurity to this extent wasn\u2019t on the list before. Now it is,\u201d said Cari-Ann Burgess, the chief election official in Washoe County, Nevada. \u201cWe have drills that we work through, we have emergency plans that we have prepared. We are a lot more cautious now than we ever have been.\u201d\n\nIn Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, about a four-hour drive from where Trump was wounded in an assassination attempt during a campaign rally in July, election officials estimate they now spend about 40% of their time on security and working with local law enforcement and emergency managers on election plans. This involves regular trainings to prepare for anything that might interfere with voting or counting ballots.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very volatile, and Luzerne County reflects what is going on across the country\u201d said County Manager Romilda Crocamo, who oversees the election office staff. \u201cIt seems that people are very emotional, and sometimes that emotion escalates.\u201d\n\nCrocamo is considering purchasing panic buttons for poll managers who will be at some 130 voting locations throughout the county on Election Day. State law in Pennsylvania prohibits law enforcement from being inside polling locations, but Crocamo and her team are speaking with local officials about having emergency responders with their radios at the sites should something happen.\n\nMany local officials said they have increased the law enforcement presence at election offices, including on election night when poll workers are bringing in ballots and other material from voting locations. Added law enforcement also is planned in the weeks after Election Day, during the canvass of the votes and certifying the results.\n\nIn Los Angeles, law enforcement canine teams will be helping scan incoming mail ballots for suspicious substances. It\u2019s part of an updated approach that includes a new $29 million election office that consolidates operations that previously had been spread across the county.\n\nDean Logan, who oversees elections for Los Angeles County, said security remains a top concern. He pointed to social media posts suggesting ways to damage ballot drop boxes and hamper mail voting. He said the letters with white powder were designed to disrupt election operations, and it\u2019s the responsibility of election officials to ensure that doesn\u2019t happen.\n\nThe office will have round-the-clock security and additional staffing from the county sheriff\u2019s department for the November election.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to me that we can tell voters they don\u2019t have to be worried about the security of their ballots,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken steps to keep them safe.\u201d\n\nElection officials say security is a balancing act, ensuring safety while making sure polling places are welcoming spaces for voters and providing enough access to election offices so the public can trust the process.\n\nIn Michigan four years ago, a large crowd of Trump supporters created a tense and chaotic scene when they gathered outside Detroit\u2019s ballot counting operation the day after the election, chanting \u201cStop the count!\u201d as they banged on the windows and demanded access.\n\nDetroit City Clerk Janice Winfrey said her office is much better prepared this time, with more cameras, armed security and bulletproof glass. Observers will now be checked in and screened by security outside a large room used for counting ballots at the city\u2019s convention center.\n\n\u201cMy biggest concern was to protect the staff and the process,\u201d Winfrey said. \u201cAnd in doing so, our building \u2014 it may look the same, but it\u2019s not the same.\u201d",

        "text": "Governor Newsom signs bills to combat deepfake election content\nEarlier today, the Governor announced signing legislation to protect the digital likeness of actors and performers by ensuring that AI is not used to replicate their voice or likeness without their consent.\n\nBuilding on legislation signed by the Governor in 2019 to crack down on deepfakes in elections, the Governor today signed three bills related to election advertisements and communications.\n\nAB 2655 by Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) requires large online platforms to remove or label deceptive and digitally altered or created content related to elections during specified periods, and requires them to provide mechanisms to report such content. It also authorizes candidates, elected officials, elections officials, the Attorney General, and a district attorney or city attorney to seek injunctive relief against a large online platform for noncompliance with the act.\n\n\u201cAI-generated deepfakes pose a clear and present risk to our elections and our democracy. AB 2655 is a first-in-the-nation solution to this growing threat, and I am grateful to Governor Newsom for signing it. Advances in AI over the last few years make it easy to generate hyper-realistic yet completely fake election-related deepfakes, but AB 2655 will ensure that online platforms minimize their impact. The new law is a win for California\u2019s voters, and for our democracy,\u201d said Assemblymember Berman.\n\nAB 2839, an urgency measure by Assemblymember Gail Pellerin (D-Santa Cruz), expands the timeframe in which a committee or other entity is prohibited from knowingly distributing an advertisement or other election material containing deceptive AI-generated or manipulated content. The bill also expands the scope of existing law to prohibit materially deceptive content of elected officials, candidates, elections officials and others, authorizing them to file a civil action to enjoin the distribution of such material.\n\n\u201cSigning AB 2839 into law is a significant step in continuing to protect the integrity of our democratic process. With fewer than 50 days until the general election, there is an urgent need to protect against misleading, digitally-altered content that can interfere with the election. With the enactment of AB 2839, California is taking a stand against the manipulative use of deepfake technology to deceive voters. I\u2019m thankful that Governor Newsom signed this legislation to ensure that voters are equipped with the accurate information they need to make informed decisions this November,\u201d said Assemblymember Pellerin, Chair of the Assembly Elections Committee.\n\nAB 2355 by Assemblymember Wendy Carrillo (D-Los Angeles) requires that electoral advertisements using AI-generated or substantially altered content feature a disclosure that the material has been altered. The bill authorizes the Fair Political Practices Commission to enforce a violation of these disclosure requirements by seeking injunctive relief to compel compliance or pursuing other remedies available to the commission under the Political Reform Act.\n\n\u201cI applaud the Governor for signing AB 2355, my proposal mandating that political advertisements using content created or significantly altered by generative AI, include a clear disclosure of this fact. The availability of tools to doctor images, video, and sound is not new. However, the rapid improvements in AI and Large Language Models have made it easier to create convincingly fake images, videos, and sounds. As these technologies become more accessible and are used in political campaigns, their impact on democracy requires urgent action. Voters must be informed when generative AI is used in political advertising to substantially alter media or create misleading content. Free speech and political expression are a cornerstone of our democracy, but we cannot lose sight of our humanity amid the advancement of artificial intelligence. This is a balanced policy that makes California the first state to include artificial intelligence under its campaign transparency rules,\u201d said Assemblymember Carrillo.\n\nHome to the majority of the world\u2019s leading AI companies, California is working to harness these transformative technologies to help address pressing challenges while studying the risks they present. The state last month partnered with NVIDIA to launch a first-of-its-kind AI collaboration, and earlier hosted an AI summit convening leaders from across technology, labor, government, and academia to discuss how the technology can be used to benefit Californians. Last year, Governor Newsom signed an executive order laying out California\u2019s measured approach focused on shaping the equitable and responsible use of AI while remaining at the forefront of AI innovation.",

        "text": "Fed slashes rates by a half-point \u2013 what that means for the economy and the presidential election\nIn a widely anticipated move, the Federal Reserve announced on Sept. 18, 2024, that it was cutting its benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point to a range of 4.75% to 5% \u2013 the first time the cost of borrowing has been lowered in four years.\n\nThe move marks an important pivot point, signaling that central bankers believe they have finally won their battle against inflation. It is also significant in timing, coming just months before the U.S. heads to the polls in a tight election that could turn on how Americans feel the economy is going.\n\nThe Conversation U.S. spoke with Mike Walden, distinguished professor emeritus at North Carolina State University, about what the rate cut means for the U.S. economy \u2013 and possibly the presidential campaign.\n\nWhat does the Fed rate cut suggest about the state of the economy?\n\nThe Federal Reserve has two mandates: to pin inflation to around its target of 2% and to keep unemployment low. And the central bank balances that twin mandate when looking at whether to raise or lower base rates, or keep them the same.\n\nFor some time now, policymakers have concentrated on trying to get inflation under control through a series of interest rate hikes that took the Fed\u2019s benchmark or base rate from a range of 0% to 0.25% in early 2022 to 5.25% to 5.5% in September 2024.\n\nI believe what motivated them to drop the rate by a half-point now \u2013 rather than the quarter-point that some were expecting \u2013 is the labor market. The labor market is not exactly shaky \u2013 unemployment is currently at 4.2% \u2013 but it isn\u2019t as robust as it was.\n\nThe latest job numbers were a little below expectations. And some economists are saying that there is a recession ahead. Indeed, there are some that are saying the U.S. is already in a recession.\n\nSo my guess is the majority of the Fed\u2019s rate-setting board were convinced more by the latest unemployment data than inflation. In terms of the dual mandate, the Fed clearly feels it\u2019s got the inflation fight in the bag, so it has turned to its second concern of keeping unemployment low.\n\nSo is this the soft landing the Fed was hoping for?\n\nI would say so, yes. We are now in a soft landing \u2013 and I forecast the U.S. economy to slow but avoid a recession.\n\nIf I am right, then that is an achievement of Fed policy. A soft landing is very unusual \u2013 I can think of only one other occasion when it has occurred since the end of World War II. That was in mid-1995. And the story goes that then-Fed chair Alan Greenspan, during his daily soak in a tub for a bad back, became worried about the prospect of significantly higher prices. He proceeded to convince the Fed board to raise rates, which it did \u2013 a move that headed off a potential recession.\n\nWhat impact will the rate cut have?\n\nThe first thing to note is that this will not mean we are returning back to 2019 prices \u2013 that would take wage cuts and deflation. This will merely slow inflation, or the rate at which prices rise.\n\nBut it will have an impact. In the first hour after the decision was made, stock markets jumped on the news \u2013 so investors were clearly happy \u2013 though the major indices ended the day lower.\n\nInvestment markets tend to anticipate any expected change, so we have already seen some lowering of mortgage rates \u2013 which have been trending down in the run-up to the Fed decision. Credit card interest rates have been trending down, too.\n\nSo the markets were clearly expecting a Fed rate cut. But we should see further drops in mortgage rates because the Fed has hinted at more interest rate cuts to come.\n\nIs there a danger that some observers will see this as a political move?\n\nI\u2019m sure a lot of people will read this as Fed Chair Jay Powell helping the Democrats by cutting rates before the election.\n\nBut this is an economic-driven decision. There is no evidence that this has anything to do with the election.\n\nWhat does history tell us about rate cuts and elections?\n\nI think most serious observers know that the Fed is independent and makes decisions based purely on what is best for the economy. In fact, over the past 50 years, you will only find one period when eyebrows were raised. That was during the Nixon administration.\n\nUnder Fed Chair Arthur Burns, the central bank was accused of pumping money in the the system and cutting rates to make things look prosperous in advance of the 1972 election. But it later all blew up when the U.S. headed into a period of double-digit inflation.\n\nAside from that, you will be hard-pressed to find real evidence of interference. In fact, since then, presidential candidates from both parties have complained about the Fed.\n\nNonetheless, could the rate cut play into the election campaign?\n\nIn terms of how Americans feel about the economy? Not really. I don\u2019t think mortgage rates will drop much more. And although the news is encouraging for borrowers, there is another side of rate cuts: They are negative for some types of investors. Money market investors, for example, will not look upon the Fed move so fondly.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean the two presidential tickets won\u2019t try to turn the news to their benefit.\n\nDemocrats will happily take any credit for getting inflation back down on their watch and will point out how it will help Americans with home loans \u2013 avoiding the fact that they don\u2019t actually have any role in the rate decisions themselves.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans might well say: \u201cHey, the Fed dropped rates because the economy is worse than we thought. And a half-point cut means they are desperate, the economy is horrible and we are heading for recession because of the Biden administrations\u2019s policies.\u201d",

The Union has endorsed every Democratic candidate since 2000.\n\nIt comes in the wake of scrutiny of its president, Sean O\u2019Brien, becoming the first Teamsters leader to address the Republican national convention in July.\n\nJohn Palmer, vice-president at large at the Teamsters, called the decision to appear at the convention, \u201cunconscionable\u201d given Trump\u2019s record opposing labor unions.\n\nHarris, the Democratic presidential candidate, met with the Teamsters this week for a roundtable discussion prior to the decision. Trump and Joe Biden attended roundtables with the union earlier this year.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, neither major candidate was able to make serious commitments to our union to ensure the interests of working people are always put before big business,\u201d O\u2019Brien said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cWe sought commitments from both Trump and Harris not to interfere in critical union campaigns or core Teamsters industries \u2013 and to honor our members\u2019 right to strike \u2013 but were unable to secure those pledges.\u201d\n\nThe union\u2019s vice-president-at-large, John Palmer, told Politico that 14 Teamsters board members voted to not endorse a candidate, while 3 voted to endorse Harris, and none voted to endorse Trump. He was among the three who voted to endorse Harris, and called the decision not to endorse \u201ccowardice\u201d.\n\nThe Teamsters National Black Caucus endorsed Harris last month.\n\nIn response to the non-endorsement, Teamsters against Trump, a grassroots group of Teamster members and retirees, announced they will expand campaigning efforts to elect vice-president Kamala Harris.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Stakes \u2014 Presidential Transition Free newsletter We will guide you through the aftermath of the US election and the transition to a Trump presidency Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Donald Trump doesn\u2019t give a damn about the working class. As President, Trump didn\u2019t lift a finger to help Teamsters whose pensions were in danger. Instead, he installed his billionaire friends in the White House and did everything he could to stop workers from organizing into unions,\u201d said James Larkin, a member of Teamsters Local 299 in Detroit, Michigan and member of the group, in a statement.\n\nThe Trump campaign welcomed the Teamsters\u2019 decision, with press secretary Karoline Leavitt, saying in a statement, \u201cwhile the Teamsters Executive Board is making no formal endorsement, the hardworking members of the Teamsters have been loud and clear.\n\nIn a statement posted to her personal X account, House Speaker Emeritus, Nancy Pelosi, called the Teamsters decision \u201cdisappointing\u201d, and said, \u201cDonald Trump refused to support a pension bill for Teamsters. It was Biden-Harris and Democrats who saved Teamsters pensions in the Butch Lewis Act of our American Rescue Plan \u2013 without one Republican vote.\u201d",

        "text": "When is quiet too quiet? Understanding shifts in extremist mobilization in 2024\nMobilizing for Trump\n\nMobilization in support of Donald Trump reveals a departure from this trend of opportunistic mobilization. Extremist groups participated in roughly 10% of the more than 1,200 pro-Trump demonstrations ACLED records in 2020, as well as nearly a third of pro-Trump demonstrations in 2021 amid the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d movement. This means that despite a decline of more than 70% in pro-Trump demonstrations from 2020 to 2021, extremist participation in pro-Trump demonstrations more than tripled as a percentage of overall activity. So far in 2024, extremist groups have participated in approximately 10% of pro-Trump demonstrations, following similar patterns to 2020. However, pro-Trump demonstrations have been roughly two-thirds less frequent than they were over the same period in 2020, despite the assassination attempts against the former president and his conviction on criminal charges (see graph below).\n\nThis precipitous decline indicates that Trump\u2019s followers may have grown less responsive to his calls to action than they were in the past. In 2021, hundreds of demonstrations \u2014 including the 6 January Capitol riot \u2014 mobilized after Trump claimed the election had been stolen from him. Just over two years later, in March 2023, Trump expressly called for his followers to \u201cPROTEST, TAKE OUR NATION BACK\u201d on his site, Truth Social, predicting he would be arrested for his alleged interference in Georgia\u2019s 2020 election. Over the next month, only around three dozen demonstrations \u2014 many with more media present than actual demonstrators \u2014 were organized across the country. When Trump was actually arrested in August of the same year, fewer than five pro-Trump demonstrations were recorded over the following month. Similarly, when he was convicted in late May 2024, ACLED records only roughly a dozen pro-Trump demonstrations over the next month. Though many far-right groups have expressed outrage online over legal proceedings against Trump, they have rarely mobilized to oppose them.\n\nAfter the assassination attempt against Donald Trump on 13 July 2024, Republican elected officials predicted an outpouring of popular support, culminating in Trump\u2019s victory in November. As Republican Congressman Derrick Van Orden predicted hours after the shooting, \u201cPresident Trump survives this attack, he just won the election.\u201d Indeed, over the next month, demonstrations in support of Trump spiked to their highest levels since January 2021, though ACLED records fewer than 50 such demonstrations, and only one involving the participation of an extremist group \u2014 a 20 July rally involving KKK affiliates in rural Michigan. Moreover, possibly because no clear motive could be immediately identified for the would-be assassin\u2019s actions, demonstrations \u2014 and media focus on the assassination attempt \u2014 tapered off quickly, especially following President Biden\u2019s announcement that he would drop out of the 2020 race. The more recent apparent assassination attempt of 15 September may trigger a similar wave of sympathy demonstrations, though it remains to be seen if these will be as short-lived as those in July.\n\nAlthough extremist groups appear to have more perseverance when it comes to demonstrating in support of Trump than for other issues, it might seem reasonable that the culmination of an assassination attempt and a criminal conviction against him (especially against the backdrop of an election year) would result in a much larger spike in pro-Trump demonstrations involving these groups. It is not clear what explains this apparent gap in opportunities for pro-Trump mobilization and the present reality.\n\nEspecially before Biden dropped out of the race, many groups may have seen little need to mobilize to support Trump. To many, Trump \u2014 who is seen variously as the champion of these groups\u2019 preferred agendas or the best viable option at the present moment \u2014 may have seemed sure to regain the presidency. Other groups may fear a repeat of the law enforcement crackdown on extremist groups following the Capitol riot, with some leaders, including the Proud Boys\u2019 main Telegram channel, referring to opportunities to mobilize as \u201ctraps\u201d or \u201choney pots.\u201d This may help explain an increase in online threats and harassment against local officials recorded by Princeton\u2019s Bridging Divides Initiative, even as in-person action involving extremist groups has fallen. Still, others may be disillusioned with Trump, seeing him as disloyal or weak for failing to live up to their expectations politically or pardon the Capitol rioters. For example, some antisemitic groups have condemned Trump on Telegram for his support for Israel. While overall extremist group support for Trump may seem slightly cooler compared to previous years, the most active neo-Nazi and white supremacist groups appear to have taken an even chillier stance toward the former president. In addition, few of these groups reacted to Trump\u2019s conviction or the assassination attempt against him, apparently choosing to stay silent on these matters instead (though at least one pro-Trump demonstration organized by the KKK did take place following the July assassination attempt). Whatever the case \u2014 hubris, complacency, fear, disillusionment, or something else \u2014 it seems most likely that different explanations fit different groups to varying degrees.",

        "text": "Understanding the Electoral Count Reform Act of 2022\nThe Electoral Count Act (ECA) governs the casting and counting of electoral votes for president and vice president every four years. The statute sets the timeline for states to appoint presidential electors in November and for electors to cast their votes in December, and describes the process that Congress should follow when it counts the states\u2019 electoral votes in January. Originally enacted in 1887, the statute remained largely the same for well over a century and was badly in need of an update. It included antiquated and ambiguous language, and failed to offer clear guidance on key aspects of the process of counting electoral votes and resolving related disputes \u2014 weaknesses that rendered the statute open to misunderstanding or exploitation, and risked the peaceful transitions of power that have been a hallmark of our democracy.\n\nRead Electing the President: From Election Day to the Joint Session, a 2024 report on the Electoral Count Reform Act from Protect Democracy, the Campaign Legal Center, and Bipartisan Policy Center. Read Electing the President: From Election Day to the Joint Session,\n\nIn late December 2022, Congress passed the Electoral Count Reform Act (S.4573 ) as part of omnibus appropriations legislation. The bill updates the ECA, providing much-needed clarity on the process of casting and counting electoral votes, striking a better balance between the roles of state and federal actors in that process, and eliminating many of the most concerning potential weaknesses in the law.\n\nThe following is an overview of the ECRA\u2019s key provisions.\n\nRequires that states appoint electors on Election Day in accordance with pre-existing law and eliminates the concept of \u201cfailed\u201d elections. [Section 102]\n\nPrevious law (3 U.S.C. \u00a7 1) set \u201cthe Tuesday next after the first Monday in November\u201d as the date on which states must appoint their presidential electors (i.e., Election Day because all states appoint electors based on a popular election).\n\nIn addition, however, the law (3 U.S.C. \u00a7 2) provided that if a state has held an election but somehow \u201cfailed to make a choice\u201d on Election Day, then the state legislature could choose the manner of appointing electors on a subsequent day. (A version of this provision technically dates back to the Presidential Election Day Act of 1845 and thus preceded the ECA.) This provision was meant to accommodate run-off elections and extreme weather conditions that sometimes prevented the completion of elections on a single day. But the language is vague as to what it means for an election to \u201cfail.\u201d As a result, some partisan actors have wrongly suggested that delays in counting votes or disputes about how an election was conducted can form the basis of a \u201cfailure\u201d that would justify state legislatures appointing electors themselves after Election Day.\n\nThe ECRA eliminates 3 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 entirely and instead provides that states must appoint electors on a designated date (the same date as previous law), except that a state that holds a popular election may \u201cmodif[y] the period of voting as necessitated by force majeure events that are extraordinary and catastrophic, as provided under laws of the state\u201d enacted prior to Election Day. In doing so, the legislation eliminates the \u201cfailed election\u201d loophole and the potential for partisan actors to exploit it.\n\nImportantly, because it allows only a modified (i.e., extended) voting period, and only when \u201cnecessitated\u201d by \u201cforce majeure\u201d events (such as a natural disaster) that qualify as \u201cextraordinary and catastrophic,\u201d the ECRA does not allow state legislatures to step in to appoint electors themselves after Election Day. Nor does it allow claims of fraud to trigger the exception to appointing electors on Election Day.\n\nAdds clarity to the process by which state officials ascertain and certify their election results to Congress. [Section 104]\n\nThe ECRA makes clear that the executive of each state is required to certify the state\u2019s appointment of electors (in essence, its election results) to Congress no later than six days before the date on which the Electoral College meets, and that he or she must do so \u201cunder and in pursuance\u201d of state law enacted prior to Election Day. The legislation defines \u201cexecutive\u201d to mean the governor unless the state designates another official in advance.\n\nThe ECRA sets \u201cthe first Tuesday after the second Wednesday in December\u201d as the date on which the Electoral College must meet, only one day later than in the past. It further provides that Congress must treat the executive\u2019s certification as \u201cconclusive\u201d unless a state or federal court has ordered that it be replaced or modified \u2014 in which case Congress must treat the new/modified certificate as conclusive (with federal courts having the final say on issues of federal law, including the ECRA itself).\n\nGives federal courts a clear and expedited role in ensuring that states send lawful certifications of election results to Congress. [Section 104]\n\nPrevious law did not explicitly provide any role for the federal courts in resolving disputes about a state\u2019s appointment of electors. The ECRA creates an expedited procedure for federal courts to hear claims brought by presidential candidates pursuant to existing federal law (constitutional or statutory) with respect to a state executive\u2019s duty to issue and transmit to Congress the certification of appointed electors. Specifically, it incorporates another provision of federal law (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2284) that provides for cases to be heard by a three-judge court. (The only difference is that the ECRA requires that the panel be composed of two circuit judges and one district judge, rather than two district judges and one circuit judge, and the 5-day notice period included in \u00a7 2284(b)(2) does not apply.)\n\nThe ECRA also allows for direct appeal to the Supreme Court (via a petition for writ of certiorari) and requires that if the Supreme Court hears the case it do so \u201con an expedited basis, so that a final order of the court on remand of the Supreme Court may occur on or before the day before the time fixed for the meeting of electors.\u201d\n\nImportantly, this legislation does not preclude candidates from bringing other election-related litigation in state or federal court except to the extent that the narrow set of claims described\u2014regarding the executive\u2019s issuance and transmission of the certification of appointed electors\u2014are subject to an expedited procedure. And it does not affect state or federal claims available to voters. The legislation states explicitly that it \u201cshall not be construed to preempt or displace any existing State or Federal cause of action.\u2019\u2019\n\nThese provisions of the ECRA, combined with others, seek to ensure that only one even arguably lawful slate of electors from each state is presented to Congress to count. This should address concerns about governors or other state officials going \u201crogue\u201d and purporting to certify appointments of electors that do not reflect the outcome of the election.\n\nMakes it absolutely clear that the Vice President\u2019s role in the electoral vote-counting process is ministerial. [Section 109]\n\nThe 12th Amendment provides that, after they vote as part of the Electoral College, presidential electors must send certificates of their electoral votes to the president of the Senate (usually the vice president). But with respect to the vice president\u2019s role during the counting process, the 12th Amendment says only that \u201c[t]he President of the Senate shall, in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all the certificates and the votes shall then be counted.\u201d The original ECA designated the President of the Senate as the presiding officer when Congress meets on January 6. The statute assigned the presiding officer specific duties, such as \u201cpreserving order,\u201d calling for objections, and announcing the results.\n\nContrary to arguments made during the last election, neither the 12th Amendment nor the ECA contemplated a role for the vice president \u2014 or any other presiding officer \u2014 that involves making substantive decisions about which electoral votes to count. That said, the law could have been explicit in order to foreclose any argument that the vice president has the power to decide the election.\n\nAccordingly, the ECRA specifies that the vice president\u2019s role in the process of counting electoral votes is limited to \u201cministerial duties\u201d and that he or she has \u201cno power to solely determine, accept, reject, or otherwise adjudicate or resolve disputes over the proper list of electors, the validity of electors, or the votes of electors.\u201d\n\nMakes it more difficult for members of Congress to make frivolous objections to state election results. [Section 109]\n\nPrevious law allowed for objections to a state\u2019s electoral votes as long as those objections were made in writing and signed by one senator and one representative. It was therefore too easy for members of Congress to disrupt the counting process (and potentially make objections that unfairly undermine public confidence in the integrity of the election). The ECRA raises the threshold required to make a cognizable objection to one-fifth of each chamber, while retaining the requirement that each chamber must sustain objections by a majority vote.\n\nIn addition, the legislation specifies two grounds for objections, drawing on language in current law but more clearly distinguishing between the two grounds and indicating that both grounds are meant to be narrow.\n\nThe first objection the ECRA allows is that \u201cthe electors of the state were not lawfully certified under a certificate of ascertainment of appointment of electors [as set forth earlier in the bill].\u201d By its terms, this objection applies only to the appointment of electors. Because the earlier provisions of the bill are designed to ensure that only one, lawful slate of electors is sent to Congress to count, this objection should only be applicable in rare circumstances in which some actor (e.g., the vice president) purports to present a slate of electors that does not qualify as conclusive under those earlier provisions.\n\nThe second permissible objection is that \u201cthe vote of one or more electors has not been regularly given.\u201d By its terms, this objection applies only to the electoral votes cast by lawfully appointed electors. The term \u201cregularly given\u201d is properly understood to encompass only a narrow set of legal infirmities with an elector\u2019s vote, such as an elector voting for an ineligible candidate or voting on the wrong day, or an elector voting as the result of bribery or other improper influence.\n\nAll of these provisions combined improve on the law by better ensuring that Congress keeps to its constitutional role of counting electoral votes, and by making it more difficult for members of Congress to misuse the counting process to second-guess a state\u2019s appointment of electors.\n\nClarifies how a majority of appointed electors will be calculated. [Section 109]\n\nThe 12th Amendment provides that \u201c[t]he person having the greatest number of votes for President, shall be the President, if such number be the majority of the whole number of Electors appointed.\u201d Because the total number of electors that may be appointed (and usually are appointed) by the states is 538, a candidate with 270 or more electoral votes wins the election. But neither the Constitution nor the original ECA made clear what happens to the calculation if either a state fails to appoint some or all of its allotted electors, or Congress rejects electoral votes.\n\nThis legislation addresses this ambiguity by providing that in cases in which Congress rejects the appointment of electors as unlawful, the \u201cwhole number of electors appointed\u201d\u2014the denominator in the calculation\u2014will be reduced. The provision makes it more difficult to manipulate the process by attempting to deprive a candidate of a majority in order to trigger a \u201ccontingent election\u201d of the president by the House of Representatives or the vice president by the Senate (as provided for in the 12th Amendment). Because the ECRA does not explicitly address electoral votes that are rejected by Congress as not lawfully cast by appointed electors (i.e., not regularly given), the denominator presumably would not change in that circumstance.\n\nReforms like those included in the ECRA significantly improve the law governing presidential elections and better protect the electoral vote-counting system from gamesmanship without benefitting either political party. Protect Democracy is pleased that Congress passed these vital updates to the Electoral Count Act to better protect future elections and the transfers of power that follow.",

        "text": "Down to the wire: The Hindu Editorial on the run-up to the U.S. presidential election\nA second, apparent attempt on the life of former U.S. President and Republican candidate for the White House, Donald Trump, has again lent an air of drama to the unfolding U.S. election campaign. Unlike the first such attempt, in Pennsylvania in mid-July, and in which a shooter\u2019s bullet hit Mr. Trump\u2019s ear, a man with a rifle at the golf club where Mr. Trump was located was confronted by the Secret Service and taken into custody. While the two attempts may win Mr. Trump some sympathy votes on November 5, it remains to be seen whether these incidents impact the public psyche sufficiently to tip the race in his favour. As it stands, the race between Mr. Trump and his Democratic rival, Vice-President Kamala Harris, is poised on a knife\u2019s edge, with the latest national average of polls putting Ms. Harris ahead by three percentage points \u2014 49%. Yet, analysts argue that the difference is not beyond the margin of statistical error, which would make it unwise to assume a winner based on the current trend.\n\nLeaving aside unexpected or shock events that could dramatically shift the terms of the race between now and voting day, the old election adage and past statistical observation that a greater turnout may benefit Democrats will likely hold true in 2024. Indeed, in the 2022 mid-term elections, the performance of Republicans, who were on a strong wicket after incumbent President Joe Biden\u2019s approval rating had fallen to relatively low levels, was dented by Democratic Party supporters who turned out in greater numbers in the wake of the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe vs Wade on the federal right to abortion. Similarly, Democrats may have felt encouraged after the first Trump-Harris presidential debate, wherein Mr. Trump made unfounded allegations about immigrants eating the pets of Americans. Immigration reform has always been a thorny issue that has punctured the campaign of many a previous presidential candidate or the policy plans of elected representatives. Mr. Trump already alienated many voters during his first term and campaign when he implemented his so-called \u201cMuslim ban\u201d \u2014 travel to the U.S. from certain Muslim-majority nations \u2014 and made derogatory remarks about immigrants from Mexico and parts of Latin America. While it is clear that he intends to continue down this path of racist nativism, it remains to be seen whether Ms. Harris will be able to offer a rational and humane border and asylum policy for undocumented workers, including a reasonable and just path to citizenship for those who are productive members of American society. There is a palpable need for bipartisan politics and policy at this juncture.",

        "text": "IVF as an Election and Policy Issue\nFor the second time this term, a bill that would have established a national right to in vitro fertilization (IVF) has failed to garner sufficient votes in the Senate on a largely party line vote.\n\nIVF became an election issue shortly after a February 2024 ruling of the Alabama Supreme Court categorized embryos created through IVF as \u201cunborn children\u201d under the state\u2019s law. This ruling brought media attention to the potential implications of fetal personhood laws, which are embedded in some state abortion bans and a variety of other public policies, on curtailing access to fertility assistance.\n\nAccording to a recent KFF poll, 57% of voters say they want to hear more about IVF from the candidates. This issue is particularly salient for Democrats (77%) and women in their reproductive years (76%), but also four in ten Republican voters feel it is important for the presidential candidates to talk about IVF.\n\nVice President Harris and former President Trump have both recently expressed their support for IVF care. Trump has stated that his administration would require insurance coverage of IVF services or have the government pay for those who don\u2019t have insurance. There is no mechanism for a President to unilaterally require plans to cover IVF or to allocate funds to provide coverage for those who are uninsured or covered by Medicare or Medicaid. Congress would need to approve a new law to provide IVF coverage, and nearly all Republican senators voted against the right to IVF, and many conservative groups, including the Southern Baptist Convention and Catholic Church, expressly oppose IVF.\n\nWhile IVF services account for approximately 2% of births in the US, they are extremely costly and out of reach for many low and middle income people who need the technology to start or grow their families, a significant gap in health care coverage today. While public support for IVF is high, Congress has been unable to agree even on the right to get IVF services. Agreement on coverage and funding seem even more out of reach.",

The move is a blow to Harris, who has touted her union backing on the campaign trail in her push to win Rust Belt battlegrounds .",
        "text": "Teamsters union skips 2024 presidential endorsement, won't back Harris or Trump\nThis story was updated to add new information.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The International Brotherhood of Teamsters said Wednesday it won't make an endorsement in the 2024 presidential election, choosing not to throw the union's support behind either Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Donald Trump.\n\nThe move is a blow to Harris, the Democratic nominee who has touted her union backing on the campaign trail in her push to win the key Rust Belt battlegrounds of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan.\n\nIt marks the first time the Teamsters has skipped an endorsement in a presidential election since 1996, having supported the Democratic nominee in each election that followed.\n\n\"Unfortunately, neither major candidate was able to make serious commitments to our union to ensure the interests of working people are always put before Big Business,\" Sean O'Brien, Teamsters' president, said in a statement following a nearly one-year candidate review process.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nMore:'So goes Pennsylvania': Inside the Harris-Trump fight for top 2024 battleground\n\nThe union's General Executive Board arrived at the decision during a meeting Wednesday in Washington after Teamsters leaders met with Harris on Monday. The union's leaders met with Trump in January.\n\nTeamsters, one of the nation's largest unions, has 1.3 million members including truck drivers, freight workers, airline pilots and zookeepers, among a wide range of other workers.\n\nTeamsters leaders commended Harris' support of the pro-union PRO Act in Congress and her opposition to \"right-to-work\" laws that undermine unions. Trump, on the other hand, would not commit to vetoing a national \"right-to-work\" law, the union said in a statement, which it called a \"red line for the Teamsters.\"\n\nBut neither candidate in their interviews, according to Teamsters, agreed not to intervene in labor disputes under the Railway Labor Act, which gives Congress the authority to set contracts in the rail and airline industries. To avert a freight rail shutdown in 2022, Congress approved a new contract for rail workers that lacked support of Teamsters' members.\n\n\"We sought commitments from both Trump and Harris not to interfere in critical union campaigns or core Teamsters industries \u2010 and to honor our members\u2019 right to strike \u2013 but were unable to secure those pledges,\" O'Brien said.\n\nMore:Harris leads Trump in Pennsylvania \u2014 and two bellwether PA counties \u2014 exclusive poll finds\n\nTeamsters' rank-and-file members support Trump, polls find\n\nTrump has courted the backing of rank-and-file union members \u2013 even if he lacks the endorsement of their unions \u2013 as he looks to match the working-class coalition that won him the 2016 election.\n\nAhead of its announcement, Teamsters released internal polling data of members that found the majority of them back Trump over Harris, even as leaders of other unions have widely backed the vice president.\n\nIn a phone survey of Teamsters members taken last week, 58% said they support Trump and 31% said they back Harris. An electronic survey taken over the summer found a similar 60-34% margin in favor of Trump.\n\nWhen President Joe Biden was the presumptive Democratic nominee, a Teamsters straw poll taken in the spring and summer found rank-and-file members backed Biden 44%-37% over Trump, according to the union. However, the straw poll used a different methodology, with members voting in person at Teamsters town halls.\n\n\"While the Executive Board of the Teamsters is making no formal endorsement, the vast majority of rank-and-file working men and women in this important organization want President Donald Trump back in the White House,\" the Trump campaign said in a statement.\n\nTrump, campaigning in New York, told reporters, \"It's a great honor. They're not going to endorse the Democrats. That's a big thing.\"\n\nIn response to the Teamsters' decision, Harris campaign spokeswoman Lauren Hitt pointed to several local Teamsters chapters that have endorsed the vice president \u2013 including some that broke with the national union Wednesday.\n\nTeamsters Joint Councils 7 and 42, which includes 300,000 members in California, Nevada, Hawaii and Guam, endorsed Harris shortly after the national union's announcement, as well as Michigan Teamsters Joint Council 43 and Teamsters Joint Council 39, which represents all Teamsters in the state of Wisconsin.\n\n\"While Donald Trump says striking workers should be fired, Vice President Harris has literally walked the picket line and stood strong with organized labor for her entire career,\" Hitt said. \"The Vice President\u2019s strong union record is why Teamsters locals across the country have already endorsed her - alongside the overwhelming majority of organized labor.\"\n\nHitt added: \"As the Vice President told the Teamsters on Monday, when she is elected president, she will look out for the Teamsters rank-and-file no matter what \u2013 because they always have been and always will be the people she fights for.\u201d\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., called the Teamsters' decision \"disappointing\" in a statement. \"Donald Trump refused to support a pension bill for Teamsters. It was Biden-Harris and Democrats who saved Teamsters pensions in the Butch Lewis Act of our American Rescue Plan \u2014 without one Republican vote,\" Pelosi said.\n\nMore:Kamala Harris needs Latinos to win these swing states. They say she has more to do\n\nTeamsters president spoke at RNC convention\n\nTeamsters endorsed Biden over Trump in the 2020 election. But for months, Teamsters leadership held off announcing its 2024 endorsement decision even as nine of the nation's 10 largest unions endorsed Harris, including United Auto Workers, the AFL-CIO and United Steelworkers.\n\nIn August, O'Brien became the first Teamsters president to speak at the Republican convention over the union's 121-year history, a move that angered many Democrats.\n\n\"Democrats, Republicans, and independents proudly call our union home, and we have a duty to represent and respect every one of them,\" O'Brien said in a statement. \"We strongly encourage all our members to vote in the upcoming election, and to remain engaged in the political process. But this year, no candidate for President has earned the endorsement of the Teamsters\u2019 International Union.\"\n\nAlthough Teamsters has typically backed Democratic presidential nominees, the union has endorsed its share of Republicans, including presidents George H.W. Bush in 1988, Ronald Reagan in both 1980 and 1984 and Richard Nixon in 1960 and 1972.\n\nLike 1996 and this year, Teamsters also did not endorse in the 1976 election between Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford.\n\nContributing: Reuters\n\nReach Joey Garrison on X, formerly Twitter, @joeygarrison.",

        "text": "NTEU Endorses Harris for President\nNTEU Endorses Harris for President Press Release September 18, 2024\n\nThe National Treasury Employees Union has endorsed Kamala Harris for President of the United States.\n\nNTEU National President Doreen Greenwald announced the decision after extensive research into the candidates\u2019 records regarding the federal workforce, and consultation with NTEU members and chapter leaders across the country.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to treating federal employees with respect, valuing their service and investing in their work, Kamala Harris is the clear choice,\u201d Greenwald said. \u201cShe shares our values and our commitment to making sure that the federal government works for all Americans. She has been a strong advocate for the issues that matter most to federal employees: fair pay, paid family leave, adequate agency funding and staffing, and robust collective bargaining rights.\u201d\n\nHarris\u2019 role as vice president in one of the most pro-labor administrations in history is another major factor in the endorsement decision. Vice President Harris personally led the administration\u2019s efforts to expand workers\u2019 rights as Chair of the White House Task Force on Worker Organizing and Empowerment, which leveled the playing field for federal employee unions and improved organizing efforts. Working with Congress, the administration also delivered agency budgets that provide federal employees with additional staffing and resources, including significant new investments to rebuild the IRS under the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\n\u201cHarris\u2019 commitment to sign the 2024 bipartisan border bill and increase staffing so our members at Customs and Border Protection can do their jobs securing the border at the ports of entry are examples of her commitment to ensuring federal agencies are properly funded and staffed, which is one of the many reasons why all Americans should vote for Kamala Harris,\u201d Greenwald said.\n\n\u201cKamala Harris has a long career in public service, which has given her a keen understanding of how the skilled civil servants who perform the day-to-day work of government are vital to our democracy,\u201d Greenwald said. \u201cShe is a powerful voice for workers and their unions, recognizing that taxpayers are better served when the federal workforce is organized and empowered to help agencies meet their important public service missions.\"\n\nHarris also has an established relationship with NTEU and our members. She supports the issues that matter most to our members and leaders, and as a Senator from California, she attended our Legislative Conference in 2020 and met with many of our members.\n\nNTEU also strongly supports longtime labor advocate Tim Walz for vice president, Greenwald said.\n\nGov. Walz is a veteran of the Army National Guard, a former teacher and union member who had a strong record on federal employee issues during his years as a member of Congress. He has continued his support for labor and workers as governor, including signing laws to expand public sector collective bargaining and provide paid family leave.\n\n\u201cThis is an important moment for American labor organizations to stand together and fight for workers,\u201d Greenwald said. \u201cElecting Kamala Harris and Tim Walz will allow federal employees to build on the progress of the last four years with the addition of a paid family leave policy, agency leadership that respects their union-represented workforce, and a belief that the nation prospers when workers are treated with fairness and dignity.\u201d\n\nNTEU represents federal employees in 35 federal agencies throughout the country.",

Some states require voters to be registered 30 days before an election. Check the Federal Voting Assistance Program website (www.FVAP.gov) to find more information on the deadline in your state. Whether you are a first-time voter or have voted absentee in previous elections, you should complete a Federal Post Card Application (FPCA) each year to ensure you are able to participate in elections as an overseas absentee voter.\n\nIf you have already completed a FPCA in 2024, you should soon receive your blank ballot, or instructions for how to access your ballot. Please check your state\u2019s voter registration verification website, or contact your local election office, to check the status of your absentee ballot request. Using the FPCA ensures that your state will send your ballot to you at least 45 days before the election.\n\nOnce you have completed your ballot, you can return it to your local election officials free of charge by dropping it off at the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate or mail it directly at your own expense. Transit time to the United States can take up to 20 days. You are encouraged to return your ballot as soon as possible. The recommended vote-by date from the State Department is October 4, 2024.\n\nHELP SPREAD THE WORD ABOUT OVERSEAS VOTING. Please help spread the word to your friends, family, and colleagues that U.S. citizens overseas may be eligible to vote from wherever they are. Now is the time.\n\nIf you have never voted while overseas before, it\u2019s not too late. The process is easy \u2014 just follow these steps:\n\n1. Complete a Federal Post Card Application (FPCA)\n\nThe FPCA allows you to register to vote and request your absentee ballots in one step. If you submit an FPCA, your local election officials will send you an absentee ballot for all elections for federal offices (presidential and state primaries, run-off, special, and the November general elections) that take place that calendar year. Local election officials in all U.S. states and territories accept the FPCA.\n\nThe online voting assistant available at FVAP.gov is an easy way to complete the FPCA. It will ask you questions specific to your state and tell you if electronic ballot delivery is possible. We encourage you to request that your ballot be sent to you electronically. Be sure to include your email address. The online voting assistant will generate a printable FPCA, for you to print and sign.\n\n2. Submit the Federal Post Card Application (FPCA)\n\nYou can return your FPCA to your local election officials free of charge via the nearest embassy or consulate. It must be addressed to your local election officials and be in a postage-paid envelope. A postage-paid envelope is available on the FVAP website.\n\nDrop-off Ballots: Voters may drop off voting materials at the voting box located near the consular entrance of the U.S. Embassy Bangkok or at the U.S. Consulate General in Chiang Mai, 24 hours per day, without an appointment.\n\nVoters may drop off voting materials at the voting box located near the consular entrance of the U.S. Embassy Bangkok or at the U.S. Consulate General in Chiang Mai, 24 hours per day, without an appointment. Mail Ballots: Voters can mail voting materials to the U.S. Embassy or Consulate General at the addresses below. Please ensure the materials are in a separate sealed envelope addressed to your local election officials and be in a postage-paid envelope. The U.S. Embassy or Consulate General will forward the materials to your local election office in the United States. Please utilize Thai Post or DHL to mail ballots; other methods are not reliable.\n\nU.S. Embassy Bangkok\n\nAmerican Citizens Services\n\nAttn: Voting Assistance Officer\n\n95 Wireless Road\n\nBangkok, Thailand 10330\u00a7 U.S. Consulate General Chiang Mai\n\nAmerican Citizens Services\n\nAttn: Voting Assistance Officer\n\n387 Wichayanond Rd\n\nT.

Some states allow voters to submit the FPCA via email as well. See FVAP\u2019s Voting Assistance Guide for specifics on all states.\n\n3. Receive Your Ballot\n\nAfter submitting your FPCA, most states have an online portal where you can confirm your registration and ballot delivery information. States are required to send ballots 45 days before an election for federal office to any overseas U.S. citizen who has completed an FPCA.\n\nUsing an Emergency Write-In Ballot\n\nIf you completed all required steps but have not received your ballot 30 days before an election, submit a completed Federal Write-in Absentee Ballot (FWAB). Contact the voting assistance officer at the U.S. embassy or consulate for help or visit the FVAP website to complete an FWAB using the online assistant. Write in the candidates of your choice, then print, sign, and send the FWAB to your local election officials. If your regular absentee ballot arrives after submitting a FWAB, you should still complete and return it. Your FWAB will be counted only if your regular ballot does not reach local election officials by your state\u2019s deadline. This will not invalidate your vote or result in casting two votes.\n\n4. Return Your Ballot\n\nAs with the FPCA, you can return your voted ballot to your local election officials free of charge via the nearest embassy or consulate or mail it directly at your own expense. Please note that transit time can take up to 20 days. You are encouraged to return your ballot as soon as possible. The recommended vote-by date from the State Department is October 4, 2024.\n\nPlease note that a friend or family member can drop off your election materials at the U.S. Embassy or U.S. Consulate General on your behalf, if needed.\n\nSome states also accept voted ballots via email.

        "text": "How Presidential Elections Affect The Stock Market\nphoto courtesy of U.S. Bank Wealth Management\n\nKey takeaways\n\nPresident Joe Biden\u2019s unexpected departure from the race set up a showdown between Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris and Republican former President Donald Trump.\n\nThe shakeup in the contest for the White House appears to have tightened the race in several key battleground states.\n\nWhile investors take an interest in the election, it helps to maintain a proper perspective on the potential impact on capital markets.\n\nWhile the year began with a fairly predictable Presidential election matchup, much has changed over the summer months. Former President Donald Trump easily cruised to his third consecutive Republican nomination. However, just days after July\u2019s Republican National Convention ended with Trump selecting first-term Ohio Senator JD Vance as his running mate, Democratic President Joe Biden chose to drop out of the race, endorsing his Vice President, Kamala Harris as his replacement. Since that time, Harris earned the formal nomination and added Minnesota Governor Tim Walz to the ticket as her running mate.\n\nThe revised Democratic slate appeared to shake up the state of the contest. While former President Trump came away from the Republican convention with solid momentum and an edge in what are considered the \u201cbattleground\u201d states most likely to decide the election\u2019s outcome, Vice President Harris\u2019 campaign rapidly gained momentum. The race is again considered to be fairly even based on the latest polling.1\n\nThe stock market experienced some volatility during this period of electoral tumult, but that\u2019s largely attributable to economic concerns related to a recent disappointing jobs market report. Markets reflected anxiety about the economy's resilience and whether the Federal Reserve (Fed) had delayed interest rate cuts for too long. This is one factor obscuring the capital markets impact of the Presidential race. \u201cThe market today is more focused on corporate earnings and the potential for Fed interest rate cuts,\u201d says Rob Haworth, senior investment strategy director for U.S. Bank Wealth Management. However, with election season heating up, the outcome\u2019s potential impact might draw greater investor focus.\n\nChanging electoral dynamics\n\nWhile the presidential contest\u2019s dimensions have changed, what\u2019s not clear is what the implications could be down the ballot, particularly with House and Senate races that will determine Congressional control.\n\nAlong with the headline Presidential race, one-third of the seats in the U.S. Senate (currently under narrow Democratic control) and all 435 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives (currently under narrow Republican control) are also on the ballot this fall. Here, too, a small margin may determine control beginning in 2025, with winners in many closely contested seats difficult to predict. It is conceivable that the election outcome could result in one-party control of both houses of Congress and the Presidency, or a split between the two parties, as exists today.\n\n\u201cA key consideration for investors would be the policy direction of the winning candidate,\u201d says Haworth. \u201cThe biggest policy advancements occur when one party controls the White House and both houses of Congress. Based on polls, we\u2019re a long way from that scenario at this point.\u201d\n\nAs the November election nears, investors are likely to be more attuned to the potential ramifications of the election\u2019s outcome for businesses, the economy and capital markets. \u201cWe need some clarity around key issues to be able to identify potential market winners and losers based on who wins the election,\u201d says Haworth. Candidates will likely draw more definitive policy distinctions as we enter the fall and the campaign becomes more focused. A scheduled September 10th Presidential debate between Harris and Trump is an opportunity to spell out such differences.\n\nHow issues might play out\n\nTax policy is one issue beginning to take shape. The most visible discussion centers on what happens to provisions of the Tax Cut & Jobs Act (TCJA), most of which are set to expire at the end of 2025. When passed in 2017, the package represented the most prominent domestic policy initiative of the Trump administration. If the provisions are extended, keeping tax rates lower, as former President Trump proposes, it creates new federal budget deficit concerns from the resulting tax collection reduction. To this point, the Trump campaign hasn\u2019t specified how to address deficit concerns, although it has raised the possibility of additional tariffs on imported goods as a method of boosting revenue (more on tariffs below).1\n\nIf some or all provisions of the TCJA aren\u2019t extended, tax rates could be higher for up to 60% of tax filers. Other expiring provisions would impact the standard deduction, child tax credits, and estate and gift tax exemption amounts and tax rates. For corporations, an expiration of TCJA would result in the top corporate tax rate moving from 21% back to 35%.\n\nWhen still in the race, President Biden called for extending tax breaks for those earning $400,000 or less. At the same time, he proposed that provisions benefiting those earning more than $400,000 be allowed to expire. His plan also backed raising corporate tax rates and implementing a global minimum tax.2 Vice President Harris has not yet specified whether she also supports that approach. In the meantime, Trump recently proposed cutting the corporate tax rate to 20%.3 Both Trump and Harris have also stated support to eliminate taxes on tips for service and hospitality workers.4\n\nMuch more discussion and definition around potential tax policy is likely in the months ahead. \u201cIt\u2019s still too early for investors to game out exactly how tax issues will play out over the election season,\u201d says Haworth.\n\nTariffs, particularly those placed on Chinese goods, have emerged as another issue. During his term as President, Trump implemented tariffs, and President Biden continued most of them and recently added more tariffs, reflecting a move away from previous free trade policies. The next President is likely to pursue fiscal stimulus policies to boost the economy, although likely with different combinations of tax incentives and higher spending.\n\nHaworth says party control may have more impact at the sector level. \u201cFor example, if Republicans win, there is likely to be more of a push for development of fossil fuels, while a Democratic win might further promote renewable energy development.\u201d Yet Haworth says such policy tendencies don\u2019t always translate into investment outcomes. \u201cIronically, businesses tied to renewable energy saw their stocks perform better under the Trump administration, while stocks of oil companies and other traditional energy companies have performed better under the Biden administration,\u201d notes Haworth.\n\nHow do election outcomes impact markets?\n\nAn old saying goes that \u201celections have consequences.\u201d But how do those results influence capital markets? And what are the potential ramifications for you as an investor? To better address this question, U.S. Bank investment strategists studied market data from the past 75 years and identified patterns that repeated themselves during election cycles.\n\nThe analysis points to minimal impact on financial market performance in the medium to long term based on potential election outcomes. The data also shows that market returns are typically more dependent on economic and inflation trends rather than election results.\n\nWhat may be more important to investors is what the parties represent. \u201cParty platforms, which are hammered out at national conventions, often tell the markets more important information than the name of the winner or loser of the general election,\u201d says Haworth. \u201cInvestors will try to determine which party is likely to be in power, and how that will benefit particular industry sectors of the market.\u201d\n\nHow have election outcomes affected market performance in the past and how might potential scenarios play out in the 2024 presidential election?\n\nA historical look at presidential elections\u2019 impact on the stock market\n\nU.S. Bank investment strategists reviewed market data going back to 1948. Using average 3-month returns following each election outcome\u2014and comparing those with the average 3-month return during the full analysis history\u2014strategists calculated the statistical significance of the relationship between political control and market performance using a calculation called a t-statistic, or t-test.\n\nA t-test determines whether one group of variables (in this case, the political composition of the White House and Congress) has a measurable effect on another variable (in this case, average three-month S&P 500* returns during the control period).\n\nThe analysis also looked at the exact periods of time when parties took control of different branches of government (rather than starting from election dates themselves), although this analysis resulted in similar outputs and conclusions.\n\nResults of the analysis contradict conventional wisdom that a Republican or Democratic \u201csweep\u201d of the presidency and Congress is most likely to cause market disruption. In fact, historically there has not been a statistically significant relationship between single-party control of both the White House and Congress and market performance.\n\nRather, the data uncovered three divided-government outcomes with a statistically significant relationship to market performance.\n\nTwo scenarios corresponded to positive absolute returns in excess of long-term average returns:\n\nDemocratic control of the White House and full Republican control of Congress.\n\nDemocratic control of the White House and split party control of the Senate and House.\n\nOne scenario corresponded to positive absolute returns modestly below long-term average:\n\nRepublican control of the White House and full Democratic control of Congress\n\nSource: U.S. Bank Asset Management Group\n\nHistorical economic and inflation trends and market performance\n\nWhile investors may closely monitor election results for their potential effect on stock market performance, it\u2019s important to recognize that other factors that may have greater impact on their portfolios. The historical data suggests that economic and inflation trends, more so than election outcomes, tend to have a stronger, more consistent relationship with market returns.\n\nIn general, rising economic growth and falling inflation have been associated with returns that are considered above long-term averages, while falling growth and rising inflation have corresponded to positive but below average market returns. For investors, staying focused on these patterns is probably more insightful than potential election outcomes when it comes to forecasting market performance.\n\nSources: U.S. Bank Asset Management Group\n\nStock market performance in midterm election years\n\nWhen looking at midterm election data (elections held in between presidential elections), U.S. Bank investment strategists found that the S&P 500 consistently outperformed in the year after midterms compared with non-midterm years. Just like presidential elections, which party controls Congress generally was not a factor in projecting overall equity market performance.\n\nThese equity and bond market trends were consistent over time unless there was a dramatic disruption. Read more about how midterm elections affect the stock market.\n\nSpecific stock market sectors and key policy issues to watch in election years\n\nWhile the analysis doesn\u2019t point to elections having a meaningful medium-to-long-term market impact, they could affect individual sectors and industries. Different election outcomes have the potential to affect proposed policies, regulations, or global conflicts.\n\nThe following are policy issues to monitor throughout the presidential nomination and election process:\n\nIndividual and corporate tax policies, including state and local income tax (SALT) deductions\n\nSpending priorities, such as energy, infrastructure and defense\n\nThe future of programs such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid\n\nHealthcare policy, including the future of the Affordable Care Act\n\nRegulation\n\nImmigration policy\n\nChina, including the potential for additional tariffs on Chinese-made goods.\n\nGeopolitical conflicts (Russia/Ukraine, Israel/Hamas)\n\nIn any election, there\u2019s also the potential for delays in verifying an election victor, particularly in closely contested races. At the presidential level, this occurred in both the 2000 election (settled with a Supreme Court verdict) and 2020 election (when the result was challenged by one candidate). In these instances, ensuing delays could lead to more uncertain election outcomes, in which case riskier asset classes might decline until clarity emerges.\n\nLooking to the 2024 presidential election and post-election period\n\nHarris and Trump are now officially the major party Presidential nominees. The composition and control of Congress resulting from the 2024 election is still up in the air but is another aspect of this year\u2019s election cycle that bears consideration. It also makes sense to keep an eye on which sectors are most likely to be affected by the potential for key policy changes. Despite the constant headlines revolving around elections, investors are well served to remain focused on factors such as economic growth, interest rates, inflation and corporate earnings when making portfolio decisions.\n\nDownload our white paper for more detailed analysis on the 2024 presidential election and stay up to date on the latest market news and activity.\n\n*The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 (S&P 500) is a well-known, broad capitalization weighted index of U.S. stocks.

Xavier Becerra) dealt with the ACA\u2019s preventive services mandate . A federal appeals court ruled on June 21 to preserve the mandate .",
        "text": "What Would a Trump Presidency Mean for the ACA?\nThe 2024 U.S. Presidential Election is just under two months away. Vice President Kamala Harris secured the Democratic nomination, while former-president Donald Trump won the Republican nomination.\n\nAmong the key political talking points between the two candidates is their approach to healthcare. A main point of contention under the healthcare umbrella is what will happen with the Affordable Care Act.\n\nWe broke down what the ACA might look like if Harris is elected president. Now, we\u2019ll examine what a Trump presidency would mean for the ACA.\n\nWill the ACA Remain Intact?\n\nThe most pressing and obvious issue to address is whether Trump would try to repeal the ACA or replace it. That is less clear than it was six months ago.\n\nTrump unsuccessfully attempted to repeal the ACA during his presidency. However, it did lead to certain aspects of the ACA to be challenged in court. The most prominent case (Braidwood Management Inc. v. Xavier Becerra) dealt with the ACA\u2019s preventive services mandate. A federal appeals court ruled on June 21 to preserve the mandate after it had previously been ruled unconstitutional without the federal Individual Mandate.\n\nIn November 2023, Trump indicated he would once again try to repeal the ACA if elected president. However, he walked back those comments in the spring by saying he would make the healthcare law \u201cmuch better.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Trump is not running to terminate the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Karoline Leavitt, a Trump campaign spokeswoman, said in a statement to the New York Times. \u201cHe is running to make health care actually affordable.\u201d\n\nHis running mate, JD Vance, echoed Trump\u2019s in-between position when he told the news site NOTUS recently that past efforts to repeal the law were \u201cfundamentally focused around the idea of fixing what was broken, not about stripping people\u2019s health care away.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re certainly going to see efforts to reform the system,\u201d Vance added.\n\nUnder the Biden administration, health coverage obtained through state and federal marketplaces reached a record-high participation of over 21 million last fall.\n\nThus, it\u2019s become increasingly risky from a political standpoint for Trump to move forward with any plan to repeal the ACA without a viable plan for a replacement, which has yet to be offered. Therefore, it\u2019s unlikely the ACA would go away under a Trump presidency.\n\nWhat About Premium Tax Credits?\n\nWhile we don\u2019t anticipate any repeal of the ACA under a Trump presidency, there could be significant changes from a compliance standpoint. The most pressing issue is the potential expiration of Premium Tax Credits (PTC), which were extended through 2025 by the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has called for making the expanded tax credit permanent to avoid driving up insurance premium costs. However, that could be undercut by a Republican-led government pushing for tax cuts.\n\nAs the growing national debt plays a larger role, some political observers note that PTC\u2019s price tag could become an attractive target for Trump and a Republican-led Congress eager to cut spending.\n\nThis would remove a notable compliance hurdle for employers if it came to fruition. While expanded PTC eligibility benefits employees and their families, it also raises compliance risks for employers. PTCs serve as triggers for the IRS to identify potential ACA non-compliance.\n\nWhen an employee receives a PTC from a state or federal health exchange, the IRS cross-references the request with the employer\u2019s ACA filings to identify organizations that may not be compliant with the ACA\u2019s Employer Mandate.\n\nOther healthcare observers note that it\u2019s just as likely the Trump administration would reduce spending on advertising and shorten enrollment periods. This is likely to lead to a reduction in employees who enroll in the ACA plans, but would maintain the same compliance aspects for employers.\n\nOther Potential Changes in ACA Compliance\n\nThere\u2019s a version of a Trump presidency that could actually lead to additional ACA compliance requirements for employers. Some Republican lawmakers have suggested changing the marketplaces to improve the quality and affordability of plans.\n\nAlex M. Azar II, the former health and human services secretary under Trump, told the Times that a future Republican administration would likely pursue more \u201ctechnocratic\u201d adjustments to the ACA \u2014 a reflection of how difficult it would be to unwind the law.\n\nThe Paragon Health Institute, a conservative think tank, outlined a proposed ACA reform policy to combat a rise in fraudulent enrollment in ACA exchange plans:\n\nCongress should permit the enhanced subsidies to expire after 2025;\n\nCongress should raise subsidy recapture limits to reduce incentives for people to misestimate their income;\n\nCongress or the next administration should limit automatic re-enrollment into exchange plans and end it for people moving from or into fully-taxpayer subsidized plans;\n\nCongress should appropriate cost-sharing reduction payments and prohibit silver-loading;\n\nCongress should conduct aggressive oversight of the Biden administration\u2019s management of HealthCare.gov, enhanced direct enrollment, and insurer and broker actions to take advantage of misestimating income;\n\nCongress or the next administration should reverse policies of the Biden administration that enabled such widespread fraudulent enrollment, particularly the continuous open-enrollment period for people who report they have income below 150 percent FPL.\n\nWhile it\u2019s difficult to project the compliance ramifications of such a plan, it could:\n\nNarrow furnishing deadlines;\n\nUpdate affordability safe harbors;\n\nChange Minimum Value under the Employer Mandate;\n\nLead to additional state requirements.\n\nWhile this is subject to change once in office, what\u2019s clear is employers will still have ACA compliance responsibilities under a Trump presidency. What\u2019s unclear is what exactly those responsibilities will be and if there will be less of a burden on employers.\n\nACA Compliance Remains Imperative\n\nSo, come this November, there\u2019s a lot at stake when it comes to healthcare and the ACA. Regardless, employers should remain diligent in keeping up with the responsibilities of the ACA\u2019s Employer Mandate as the IRS increases its focus and attention to detail on non-compliance.\n\nIf you need assistance with ACA compliance and the subsequent year-end filing, contact Trusaic.

        "text": "Historian who predicted 9 of last 10 presidential elections reveals 2024 pick\nAllan Lichtman, historian renowned for accurately predicting 9 out of the 10 most recent presidential elections, has shared his prediction for this year's White House race. Who does Lichtman say will win?\n\nHe forecasts that Vice President Kamala Harris will be the winner. In a video first reported by The New York Times, Lichtman explained that his prediction is based on a set of thirteen \"keys\" or true-false questions assessing the strength and performance of the incumbent party in the White House.\n\nWho is Allan Lichtman?\n\nBefore being named \"Distinguished Professor\" at American University in Washington, D.C., Lichtman earned a Ph.D. in modern American history and quantitative methods from Harvard. He has lectured globally, authored 13 books and hundreds of academic articles, and served as an expert witness in civil and voting rights cases. Lichtman is widely recognized for his political commentary and election forecasting.\n\nWhat are the 13 keys to a successful election campaign?\n\nThe keys include questions such as:\n\nDid the White House party gain House seats during the midterm elections?\n\nIs the sitting president running for reelection?\n\nIs the White House party avoiding a primary contest?\n\nIs there a third-party challenger?\n\nIs the short-term economy strong?\n\nHas long-term economic growth been as good as in the previous two terms?\n\nHas the White House party made major changes to national policy?\n\nIs there sustained social unrest during the term?\n\nIs the White House untainted by scandal, and is the incumbent party charismatic?\n\nIs the challenger uncharismatic?\n\nIs the incumbent charismatic?\n\nHas the White House party experienced a major failure in foreign policy?\n\nHas the White House party achieved foreign policy success?\n\nWhy did Allan Lichtman pick Harris?\n\nAccording to Lichtman, eight of the keys favor Harris, while three favor Trump. Lichtman notes that \"foreign policy is tricky, and these keys could flip.\" He added, \"The Biden administration is deeply invested in the war in Gaza, which is a humanitarian disaster with no end in sight. But even if both foreign policy keys flipped false, there would still be only five negative keys, which would not be enough for Donald Trump to regain the White House.\" As a result, Lichtman predicts Harris will win.\n\nPresidential debate schedule: Will Kamala Harris and Donald Trump debate again?\n\nHarris\u2019 team has agreed to a second debate before the November election, but the details are still uncertain. According to a statement from the Harris-Walz campaign, \u201cThe debate about debates is over. Donald Trump's campaign accepted our proposal for three debates \u2013 two presidential and one vice presidential.\u201d Trump last week posted that there will not be another debate against Harris. In his Truth Social post, Trump wrote, \u201cKamala should focus on what she should have done during the last almost four year period. There will be no third debate!\"\n\nWhen is the vice presidential debate between JD Vance and Tim Walz?\n\nThe vice presidential debate will take place Tuesday, Oct. 1, with GOP nominee JD Vance and Democratic nominee Tim Walz, and will be hosted by CBS News.\n\nWhen is Election Day 2024?\n\nElection Day is Tuesday, Nov. 5.

Insiders weigh in\nFormer US President Donald Trump speaks at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville, Tennessee, US, on Saturday, July 27, 2024. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nSINGAPORE \u2014 Cryptocurrency insiders downplayed the potential impact of the U.S. presidential election in November on the market here in the Lion City, even though some also said that former President Donald Trump is seen as more crypto-friendly. \"Between [Vice President Kamala] Harris and Trump, Trump is certainly the favorite from a cryptocurrency perspective,\" Charles Hoskinson, co-founder of the Ethereum blockchain, told CNBC's \"Street Signs Asia\" Wednesday, on the sidelines of TOKEN2049 in Singapore, one of the world's largest annual crypto conferences. In July, the former president was a keynote speaker at the Bitcoin Conference in Nashville, where he promised to ensure that the federal government never sells its bitcoin holdings and teased a plan to make the U.S. a \"crypto capital of the planet.\" \"But the reality is, regardless of if the U.S. is pro-crypto or not, the world is moving on,\" Hoskinson continued, adding that authorities across the world have rolled out regulatory frameworks, from Singapore to the European Union.\n\nwatch now\n\n\"As an American, it would be nice to see our country get back into the race and build things, but regardless, it's not going to change the reality that the world will be decentralized,\" Hoskinson said. Anthony Scaramucci, founder and managing partner of SkyBridge Capital, a global alternative investment firm, predicted that if Harris were to win the election, her handling of crypto regulation would largely be the same as Trump. \"I think you'll start to see her flesh out her economic policies and where she stands on cryptocurrency regulation and I'm very optimistic,\" he said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia.\" Scaramucci, who has endorsed Harris in the race, also argued that while Trump has signaled that he's pro-crypto, \"it's hard to know which direction he's going to go\" in office because he's an unpredictable politician. The Trump family recently launched a new crypto project called World Liberty Financial. Goals set by those involved in the project suggest that it will resemble a crypto banking platform.\n\nwatch now",

        "text": "Americans in both parties are concerned over the impact of AI on the 2024 presidential campaign\nAmid growing unease over the role of artificial intelligence in everyday life, a majority of Americans say they are concerned about the impact of AI on the 2024 presidential campaign.\n\nAmericans also express little confidence in major technology companies to prevent misuse of their platforms to influence the election.\n\nHow we did this Pew Research Center conducted this analysis to understand Americans\u2019 views of the influence of artificial intelligence and technology companies on the 2024 presidential election. As part of a larger study, we surveyed 9,720 adults from Aug. 26 to Sept. 2, 2024. Everyone who took part in this survey is a member of the Center\u2019s American Trends Panel (ATP), a group of people recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses who have agreed to take surveys regularly. This kind of recruitment gives nearly all U.S. adults a chance of selection. Surveys were conducted either online or by telephone with a live interviewer. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other factors. Read more about the ATP\u2019s methodology. Here are the questions used for this analysis, the topline and the survey methodology.\n\nA new Pew Research Center survey finds:\n\n39% of Americans say that AI will be used mostly for bad purposes during the presidential campaign, compared with only 5% who say it will be used mostly for good purposes. Another 27% say it will be used about equally for good and bad.\n\nA 57% majority of U.S. adults \u2013 including nearly identical shares of Republicans and Democrats \u2013 say they are extremely or very concerned that people or organizations seeking to influence the election will use AI to create and distribute fake or misleading information about the candidates and campaigns.\n\nHow Americans view tech companies\u2019 responsibility during election season\n\nWhen it comes to major technology companies, 77% of U.S. adults say companies like Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), TikTok and Google have a responsibility to prevent the misuse of their platforms to influence the 2024 presidential election.\n\nHowever, just 20% say they are very or somewhat confident that these companies will prevent their platforms from being misused, according to the survey, which was conducted Aug. 26-Sept. 2.\n\nThe share of Americans who say tech companies bear a responsibility to prevent misuse of their platforms has changed little since 2020 and 2018.\n\nViews by party\n\nMajorities in both parties continue to say tech companies have an obligation to prevent their platforms from being misused. But Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (84%) are more likely than Republicans and GOP leaners (72%) to express this view.\n\nWhile Democrats\u2019 views have changed little since 2020, the share of Republicans who now say tech companies have this responsibility is higher than four years ago. In August 2020, 64% of Republicans said tech companies were responsible for preventing misuse of their platforms.\n\nHow Americans\u2019 confidence in tech companies has changed over time\n\nPublic confidence in tech companies to prevent the misuse of their platforms to influence elections has declined over the last six years.\n\nToday, just 20% of Americans say they are very or somewhat confident in tech companies like Facebook, X, TikTok and Google to prevent the misuse of their platforms to influence the 2024 presidential election.\n\nIn 2018, a third of Americans said they were confident these companies could do this.\n\nToday, 79% of adults say they are not too or not at all confident that tech companies can stop the misuse of their platforms to influence the election.\n\nViews by party\n\nMajorities in both parties say they are not confident in technology companies to prevent misuse of their platforms. Republicans and Democrats alike have grown less confident since 2018.\n\n80% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents are not at all or not too confident in tech companies to prevent the misuse of their platforms, up from 72% who were not confident in 2018. However, the share of Republicans who say they are not at all confident has decreased since 2020 (33% now, 43% then).\n\n79% of Democrats and Democratic leaners say they are not confident in tech companies to stop misuse \u2013 an increase of nearly 20 percentage points since 2018, when 62% of Democrats were not confident.\n\nViews of AI\u2019s impact on the election differ by age, not party\n\nRepublicans and Democrats largely express similar views of how AI might influence the 2024 election.\n\nRoughly four-in-ten Republicans (41%) and Democrats (39%) say AI will be used mostly for bad during the 2024 presidential campaign.\n\nSimilar shares in both parties say they are extremely or very concerned about AI\u2019s influence on the election (56% of Republicans and 58% of Democrats).\n\nAdults in all age groups are about equally likely to say AI will be mostly used for bad during the presidential campaign. And relatively small shares in all age groups say it will primarily be used for good.\n\nBut younger adults are more likely than older adults to say AI will be used equally for good and bad. Among older people, there is more uncertainty about how AI will be used during the election.\n\n35% of adults under 30 say AI will be used about equally for good and bad, while 17% say they are not sure.\n\nAmong those ages 65 and older, 20% say AI will be used about equally for good and bad, while 39% are not sure how it will be used.\n\nAmericans ages 65 and older are more likely than people in any other age group to be extremely or very concerned about AI\u2019s influence on the election: 68% say this. Among adults under 30, by comparison, 48% have the same level of concern.\n\nNote: Here are the questions used for this analysis, the topline and the survey methodology.",

        "text": "U.S. presidential election: J.D. Vance is up to one of his favorite old tricks.\nSince I started writing about J.D. Vance in 2022, I\u2019ve repeatedly noticed his use of a certain rhetorical technique that I\u2019ve come to think of as his trademark. He\u2019ll claim vehemently to agree with one of Donald Trump\u2019s various provocative or absurd claims\u2014that the 2020 presidential election was stolen, for instance. Then he\u2019ll explain himself using internally coherent language and reasoning that sounds well informed and registers as substantive \u2026 but that in no way supports the extreme premise he started with.\n\nThe reason I bring up this go-to move is that he is using it to justify false claims about Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, who were not eating cats. But first let\u2019s look at the \u201cstolen election\u201d argument as an instructive example. Vance does not believe that there were millions of votes cast in 2020 by illegal immigrants or that \u201cballot vans\u201d made midnight drop-offs in Milwaukee and Detroit to tilt the race. He doesn\u2019t make any of the dozens of other claims of global-sabotage conspiracies and preloaded voting-machine algorithms that other MAGA figures have endorsed.\n\nInstead, he says the election was \u201cstolen\u201d by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg (because Zuckerberg donated money to a group that helped pay for COVID safety measures at voting locations in a manner that, according to Vance, made it disproportionately easier for Democrats to vote) and by Twitter (because the service briefly obstructed the distribution of stories about material found on Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop out of concerns that the information may have been fabricated or obtained illegally by a foreign government).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth of those things\u2014Zuckerberg\u2019s underwriting of COVID voting support and Twitter\u2019s laptop-story block\u2014did happen. They might have helped Democrats a bit, for all we know. But do they constitute stealing an election in anything like the way that Trump means the word? No. Legally speaking, as endeavors of private individuals and companies, would they have justified reversing the results of the election in the way Trump called for? Also no.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt appears that Vance\u2014who once sold himself to the public as an empathetic conservative intellectual\u2014is making a sort of compromise with himself in order to justify his career-advancing change of heart. He\u2019s like a walking National Review, following Trump around to retroactively undergird his pronouncements with a rational structure. (Which is funny because Trump couldn\u2019t care less whether the stuff he does is justified by \u201cevidence\u201d or \u201claws\u201d!)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNew York magazine\u2019s Jonathan Chait noticed something in this vein in Vance\u2019s June New York Times interview, when he justified Trump\u2019s instigation of violence on Jan. 6 itself. \u201cChallenging elections and questioning the legitimacy of elections is actually part of the democratic process,\u201d Vance argued to the Times\u2019 Ross Douthat. Attempting to overturn the results of the election by force, Vance says, was an expression of \u201cpalpable and actionable frustration\u201d on behalf of Trump voters, who were \u201cpissed off\u201d about not having been taken seriously over the \u201cvery legitimate grievance\u201d that they had about \u201cour most fundamental democratic act as a people.\u201d\n\nThis was all a long way of saying that they were mad because the candidate they had voted for didn\u2019t win. As Chait observed:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPeople are pissed off,\u201d he explains. Well, yes, that happens. People are always pissed off. Humans have constructed various ways of working around this reality. One of them, a constitutional republic with fair elections and robust liberal protections, has worked fairly well. I propose we keep it going, even if Vance has calculated that his continued advancement might require putting it aside.\n\nVance has a law degree, and he likes to present things in terms of principles and philosophies. But the fancy talk is just a way of weaponizing his feelings, which are actually the ultimate arbiter of fact vs. falsehood and right vs. wrong.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat brings us to Wednesday, when Vance publicly refused to stop referring to Haitians in Ohio as \u201cillegal aliens.\u201d A few weeks ago, after rumors began circulating on the right-wing web that Haitian immigrants in Springfield were stealing and eating the city\u2019s cats, Vance posted on Twitter: \u201cReports now show that people have had their pets abducted and eaten by people who shouldn\u2019t be in this country.\u201d Donald Trump then brought up the rumor at his debate with Kamala Harris as an example of the harms wreaked by illegal immigration. When authorities in Springfield said that the rumor was untrue\u2014something they communicated directly to Vance\u2019s staff almost immediately, according to new Wall Street Journal reporting\u2014Vance backpedaled slightly, saying that the accusation, even if not verifiable, was fair game to talk about because it brought attention to the legitimate issue of illegal migration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut that still doesn\u2019t quite track: The Haitians in Springfield, it turns out, are for the most part in the United States legally. They\u2019ve been granted something called temporary protected status, a designation extended by the executive branch to individuals fleeing dangerous conditions in their home countries. As the name suggests, the program does not grant beneficiaries the right to stay in the U.S. permanently. But they can live and work in the country legally for as long as the status is extended.\n\nHere\u2019s what Vance said when he was asked about this in North Carolina, according to NPR:\n\n\u201cWhat is fundamentally illegal is for Kamala Harris to say we\u2019re going to grant parole, not on a case by case basis, but to millions of illegal aliens who are coming to this country,\u201d Vance said. \u201cThat does not magically make them legal because Kamala Harris waved the amnesty wand. That makes her border policy a disgrace, and I\u2019m still going to call people illegal aliens.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy using policy jargon like parole and amnesty and case-by-case basis, Vance kind of makes it sound as if he knows what he\u2019s talking about. But temporary protected status is by definition not amnesty (which means allowing those who lack legal status to become permanent residents) or parole (which means releasing individuals into the U.S. while their residency status is being adjudicated).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTemporary protected status is also not a power that liberals in the White House have claimed out of thin air. As this report by the Congressional Research Service explains, \u201cTPS was established by Congress as part of the Immigration Act of 1990.\u201d The law, signed by (Republican) President George H.W. Bush, grants a member of the Cabinet\u2014initially the attorney general, but now the secretary of homeland security\u2014the authority \u201cto designate a country for TPS.\u201d\n\nVance describes TPS as \u201cfundamentally illegal\u201d because it is granted by the executive branch, at its discretion, on a categorical basis. In fact, however, the TPS program was created by an act of Congress that grants the executive branch the power to issue the status, at its discretion, on a categorical basis. It\u2019s fundamentally legal, if you will. A pretty clear-cut case of full legality, honestly. But did the Framers of the Constitution ever stop to consider that it might be used to do stuff that J.D. Vance doesn\u2019t like?",

        "text": "Information, Misinformation and Disinformation: Kristie Bunton on Elections, AI\nInformation, Misinformation and Disinformation: Kristie Bunton on Elections, AI\n\nThis election cycle, TCU is presenting a series of events titled Elections, Democracy and Social Values. The series aims to explore various viewpoints and aspects of an election and engage TCU\u2019s diverse community in voting as informed, responsible citizens.\n\nThe second event in the series, Information, Misinformation and Disinformation in the Era of AI, will be moderated by Kristie Bunton, dean of the Bob Schieffer College of Communication. Ahead of the event, Bunton answered a few questions on the topic at hand for TCU News.\n\nThe title of the upcoming event includes the terms \u201cinformation, misinformation and disinformation.\u201d Let\u2019s break those down. To create a baseline, what is information?\n\nGenerally, we think of information as facts, evidence and details that we may use to make decisions, such as where and when we can go to the polls to vote in an election. But factually accurate information may also be contextually inaccurate. If a journalist\u2019s news report calls a candidate \u201cKamala Harris\u201d or \u201cVice President Harris\u201d or \u201cMs. Harris\u201d or simply \u201cKamala,\u201d those are all factually accurate pieces of information about the Democratic nominee for president. But choosing to use one description and not another may create or perpetuate a bias that affects the attitudes or behaviors of the audience who receives that information.\n\nWhat is misinformation?\n\nWe usually think of misinformation as incorrect information. Misinformation is false. The reason for the misinformation may simply be that someone made a mistake. If a journalist types the wrong date or times the polls will be open, that journalist likely didn\u2019t intend to communicate false information. But that journalist\u2019s error \u2013 misinformation \u2013 can lead us to make a bad decision or create a bad consequence. The journalist who made the error didn\u2019t mean to keep me from voting, but because the journalist posted the wrong time or date in the election guide the news organization distributed, for instance, I went to the polls too late on the evening of Election Day and found them closed, so I didn\u2019t get to vote.\n\nWhat is disinformation? And how does it differ from misinformation?\n\nDisinformation is intended to create a harmful consequence. Disinformation is false or wrong information communicated by people or institutions who want to harm us in some way. Creators and distributors of disinformation mean to negatively affect those who receive that disinformation. I think disinformation and propaganda are related but different. Both disinformation and propaganda want to influence behaviors and attitudes, but disinformation wants to create damage. For example, recently, when the U.S. Department of Justice shut down several websites, it did so because the officials concluded that the Russian government was using Kremlin resources to build those websites to communicate disinformation that would influence the U.S. presidential election for the benefit of Russia.\n\nThis is the first presidential election where artificial intelligence has been at the forefront. Can you speak to what we are seeing?\n\nI think some voters are worried that AI-generated information cannot be trusted when it comes to elections. So the same people who are happily using AI tools to generate information they use in their work lives, for instance, are worried that they can\u2019t trust AI tools to provide accurate information to tell them about candidates\u2019 stances on issues. And their worry may be justified, given what we know about how quickly generative AI tools can learn from their mistakes and create yet more messaging.\n\nA few weeks ago, someone used fake AI-generated imagery of Taylor Swift that seemed to suggest the singer was endorsing former President Donald Trump. Some of her fans immediately said the Trump campaign was spreading misinformation. But was it misinformation \u2013 an honest mistake? Or was it disinformation \u2013 intended to mislead voters who might be swayed by an endorsement from Swift, who is arguably the single most influential entertainer in the world right now? What makes any of these kinds of misinformation or disinformation ethically troubling is the speed with which AI tools can generate and disseminate these messages.\n\nAs a consumer, how can I best be an informed voter and responsible citizen, given these challenges?\n\nWe have more access to more information, misinformation and disinformation than ever before. There\u2019s no shortage of messaging. Given this confusing and overloaded landscape, I think the onus is on journalists to constantly fact-check the sources of information and the accuracy of it, as many national journalists did over recent days as allegations were raised through fake social media posts that in an Ohio town immigrants from Haiti were eating their neighbors\u2019 pets.\n\nThe onus will also be on voters more than ever to check, double-check and triple-check the sources of the information they consume. I hope our panelists will be able to offer ideas about how we can all do that.\n\nElections, Democracy and Social Values: Information, Misinformation and Disinformation in the Era of AI will be held Sept. 25. Panelists will include Adam Schiffer, political science professor; Amber Phillips \u201908, a journalist from the Washington Post; and Richard Escobedo \u201916, a producer with Face the Nation.\n\nFor more on Elections, Democracy and Social Values, read Betting on Democracy: Grant Ferguson Discusses Political Predictive Markets.",

        "text": "AOC calls the US Green party \u2018not serious\u2019 \u2013 can it be more than a \u2018spoiler\u2019 in the election?\nAmerican politics often has wild deviations from the norms of other major democracies and one of the most striking differences is set to be on display in this year\u2019s election \u2013 the performance of its domestic Green party.\n\nThere are elected Greens at the national level in the UK, Canada, Mexico, France, Germany and Australia, sometimes helping form governments, and yet the US Green party has only ever had a handful of state-level representatives (it currently has none) and has never had a federal election winner.\n\nOf about 500,000 elected positions in the US, from school boards and township supervisors to the presidency, the Green party holds just 149. There\u2019s little indication there will be an influx of left-leaning Greens in November\u2019s elections, which will include local and state polls, as well as the headline presidential race in which Jill Stein is the party\u2019s nominee for a third time.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a story of complete failure,\u201d said Larry Sabato, a political scientist at the University of Virginia who argued the most consequential Green party impact has been as \u201cspoilers\u201d helping Republicans in close elections, such as Ralph Nader\u2019s campaign in 2000 and Stein\u2019s in 2016. There\u2019s a small chance such a scenario could play out again in this year\u2019s tight contest between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. One poll this month had Stein leading Harris among Muslim-American voters in three key swing states of Michigan, Arizona and Wisconsin, Middle East Eye reported.\n\n\u201cNormally the Greens aren\u2019t important but they were in 2016, they cost Hillary Clinton a couple of blue wall states, and they were in 2000,\u201d Sabato said. \u201cWhy vote for them when Democrats are also concerned about climate change? All you\u2019re doing is helping Republicans. Without them we might not have had the Iraq invasion, we might not have had Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nOthers are more sympathetic, pointing to the winner-takes-all nature of US politics and the well-funded machinery of the two-party system that makes it hard for third parties, including the Green party and the Libertarian party, to break through. Notably, however, the UK\u2019s Green party did win four seats in first-past-the-post Westminster elections in July.\n\n\u201cIt is difficult for small parties to make way in the United States because of the undemocratic electoral system,\u201d said Christine Milne, former leader of the Australian Greens, which was in coalition with the ruling center-left Labor party between 2010 and 2013.\n\n\u201cProportional representation systems provide opportunities for small parties to be elected which has been key to the growth of the Greens around the world.\u201d\n\nUnder Stein, the US Green party has complained of a duopoly but aimed most of its attacks at Democrats, accusing the party of supporting a genocide in Gaza and holding rallies with signs reading \u201cAbandon Harris\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe simple fact is there is very little policy daylight between these two candidates,\u201d Stein said following last week\u2019s debate between Trump and Harris. Stein added that Harris \u201cchooses the softer approach to fascism of capitulating to endless war and corporate rule in exchange for half a billion in campaign contributions.\n\n\u201cWhat we saw on Tuesday [last week] were two candidates striving to outbid the other\u2019s promises to push us towards a new world war and accelerate the climate emergency.\u201d\n\nSuch a stance has dismayed some who sought to build the Green party as an alternative to the two major parties. \u201cTo me this election is the choice between fascism and keeping democracy alive so it\u2019s almost unfathomable to me that people can think the parties are the same,\u201d said Ted Glick, a progressive activist who was a long-standing Green party member and ran as a Senate candidate for the party in New Jersey.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s scary to see so many people support Donald Trump and it\u2019s hard to understand how someone as smart as Jill Stein can think this guy is the same as Kamala Harris.\u201d\n\nGlick said he left the Green party in 2017 after becoming convinced the party needed to grow its base between presidential elections by focusing on states that are \u2018safe\u2019 for either of the two major parties, rather than battleground states. He said he was \u201cshocked\u201d when Stein said those who sought alliances with other progressives and independents, such as Bernie Sanders, were \u201csheepdogs for the duopoly\u201d.\n\n\u201cBernie Sanders\u2019s campaign more than anything else points the way to how we get strong, progressive alternatives in the US,\u201d Glick said.\n\n\u201cBut the Green party became very narrow and rigid, a tiny party of true believers focused on ideological purity above all else. Back in 2004 there were 225 Green party members in elected office, now it\u2019s 143 (the Green party has said it is 149). It\u2019s a pretty dismal record for 20 years of existence.\u201d\n\nRather than ally with the Democratic left wing, Stein has instead been involved in a recent battle with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the progressive Democratic congresswoman from New York. \u201cAll you do is show up once every four years to speak to people who are justifiably pissed off, but you\u2019re just showing up once every four years to do that, you\u2019re not serious,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez posted on Instagram last month. \u201cTo me, it does not read as authentic. It reads as predatory.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Stakes \u2014 Presidential Transition Free newsletter We will guide you through the aftermath of the US election and the transition to a Trump presidency Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Green party candidate, running with Butch Ware, is not on the ballot in around a dozen states and is polling at around 1% of the vote, a small but potentially significant total should certain swing states have razor-thin margins.\n\n\u201cI doubt they will have an impact but nobody expected Jill Stein to do what she did in 2016, or for Trump to win,\u201d said Sabato. \u201cIt was a perfect storm, and the storm is still raging.\u201d\n\nGlick hopes his former party isn\u2019t decisive in November. \u201cHopefully there will be a major drop off in their support when it comes to pulling the lever and preventing Trump getting back into office,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope they see the error of their ways. We need progressive alternative to the Democrats and Republicans, but this isn\u2019t the way you do it.\u201d",

        "text": "In NC, Absentee Voting Begins Friday for the 2024 General Election\nRaleigh, N.C.\n\nAbsentee ballots will be sent on Friday to military voters and citizens living outside the United States who requested them, marking the official start of the 2024 general election in North Carolina.\n\nFollowing a court decision two weeks ago requiring 2.9 million prepared ballots to be reprinted, the 100 county boards of elections, with the help of State Board staff and printing vendors, succeeded in printing new ballots ahead of the Sept. 21 federal deadline to send ballots to voters through the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA).\n\nMeanwhile, State Board staff worked to ensure all 2,347 ballot styles across the state will be available through the NC Absentee Ballot Portal. A ballot style refers to a unique combination of contests on a ballot based on voters\u2019 addresses and which contests they are eligible to vote in. Through the secure portal, any registered voter in North Carolina can request an absentee ballot. Military and overseas citizen voters can also receive and return their ballot electronically through the portal.\n\nOn Tuesday, Sept. 24, county boards of elections will begin mailing absentee ballots to all other voters who requested them for the Nov. 5 election. Ballots will be mailed through the U.S. Postal Service, and voters may not get them until several days after they are mailed.\n\nCounty boards were prepared to send absentee ballots out on Sept. 6, the deadline for absentee ballots to be sent under state law. However, rulings by the N.C. Court of Appeals and N.C. Supreme Court required election officials to remove the We The People party line from the presidential contest on the ballot, including the party\u2019s presidential nominee, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and vice-presidential nominee, Nicole Shanahan.\n\nAs a result, election officials had to code, design, proof, and print new ballots without the We The People party line.\n\n\u201cThe hard work of State Board staff, county board staff, and our printing vendors ensured that we could meet the federal deadline and start voting,\u201d said Karen Brinson Bell, executive director of the NC State Board of Elections. \u201cNorth Carolina voters, please take it from here.\u201d\n\nStatewide through Thursday morning, about 193,700 voters had requested absentee ballots, including nearly 16,000 military and overseas voters. For up-to-date data on absentee ballot requests, see the Daily Absentee Request Reports Folder.\n\n10 Tips for Voters About Absentee Voting",

        "text": "The 2024 US presidential election: A nation at the crossroads\nAdrian Pokharel is a retired US army captain and former NSA and CIA officer. He was also the Democratic Party candidate for US Congress from Virginia District 10th\n\nAs the 2024 United States presidential election approaches, the nation finds itself at a critical juncture. This election is not just a political contest; it represents a pivotal moment in America\u2019s history, grappling with issues of democracy, diversity, and leadership on a global stage. This article explores the dynamics of the upcoming election, the implications of a Kamala Harris versus Donald Trump showdown, and the complex legal landscape that allows a convicted felon to run for the presidency while being disenfranchised from voting. Additionally, we will examine who is most likely to win the presidency and what the future might hold for the House and Senate.\n\nIs America Ready for a Female President?\n\nThe United States, long considered a leader in democracy and human rights, has yet to elect a female president. While many other nations, including India, have seen women rise to their highest office, the US has slowly broken this barrier. The 2024 election, however, might present a historic opportunity to change that narrative with Kamala Harris as a candidate.\n\nKamala Harris, the first woman of Jamaican and Indian descent to hold the office of Vice President, represents a significant shift in American politics. Her candidacy could break new ground for women and minority communities, symbolizing the inclusivity and diversity of modern America. Harris\u2019s election would be a milestone in American history, potentially inspiring greater participation of women and minorities in politics and reshaping the political landscape for years to come.\n\nHowever, Harris faces considerable challenges. Critics point to her performance in the 2020 Democratic primary, where she struggled to gain widespread support. Additionally, she must confront the persistent gender biases that have historically hindered female candidates in the US. Despite these hurdles, her election would be a powerful statement about the inclusivity of American democracy. It could pave the way for future female leaders.\n\nThe Trump Factor: Should He Return to the White House?\n\nAs Kamala Harris continues her campaign, she might face a familiar opponent: Donald Trump. Trump remains a divisive figure in American politics, with a dedicated base of supporters and a vocal group of detractors. Whether Trump should or should not be president again is complex and multifaceted.\n\nArguments for Trump\u2019s Return: Trump\u2019s supporters argue that his economic policies, including tax cuts and deregulation, were crucial in driving economic growth and reducing unemployment before the Covid-19 pandemic. They believe that his \u201cAmerica First\u201d approach to national security and immigration resonates with voters who prioritize border control and a strong military. Additionally, his appointment of conservative judges, including three Supreme Court justices, is seen as a legacy that will shape American jurisprudence for decades.\n\nConversely, Trump\u2019s presidency was marked by significant political and social division. Critics contend that his leadership style, often combative, exacerbated tensions in an already polarized nation. Many believe his response to the Covid-19 pandemic was inadequate, citing inconsistent messaging and a downplaying of the virus\u2019s severity. Furthermore, Trump\u2019s unilateral approach to foreign policy strained relations with traditional allies, potentially weakening America\u2019s global standing.\n\nKamala Harris vs. Donald Trump: A Battle with Global Implications\n\nSuppose the 2024 presidential race comes down to Kamala Harris versus Donald Trump. In that case, the election\u2019s impact will extend beyond American borders, affecting international relations, global policy, and U.S. ties with key allies, including India.\n\nImpact on the United States: A Harris presidency would likely continue the current administration\u2019s focus on social justice, healthcare reform, and climate change. Her election would mark a historic moment for gender and racial equality in the US, potentially inspiring broader political participation. Conversely, a Trump victory might reinforce existing divides, with a focus on deregulation, tax cuts, and stricter immigration policies.\n\nGlobal Impact: Harris would likely pursue a more collaborative approach to international relations to restore alliances and strengthen multilateral institutions. Her background could also shape US foreign policy towards regions like South Asia and the Caribbean. In contrast, Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d policy would likely emphasize bilateral deals and reduce involvement in international organizations. Harris\u2019s administration would prioritize climate action, aligning the U.S. with global efforts to combat climate change. At the same time, Trump might withdraw from such agreements, focusing instead on energy independence through fossil fuels.\n\nImpact on India: As the daughter of an Indian immigrant, Kamala Harris has a unique connection to India, which could lead to stronger U.S.-India relations, particularly in trade, technology, and climate cooperation. However, her focus on human rights might also increase scrutiny of India\u2019s domestic policies. Trump, who has also recognized India as a strategic partner, might continue to focus on transactional relationships rather than long-term partnerships.\n\nWho is Most Likely to Win?\n\nAs the 2024 presidential race heats up, current polling and political momentum suggest a highly competitive contest. Kamala Harris, with the support of the Democratic Party and the historic nature of her candidacy, has a strong chance of mobilizing critical demographic groups, including women, minorities, and younger voters. Her success will depend on her ability to inspire turnout among these groups and appeal to moderates who may be wary of the extremes in both parties.\n\nOn the other hand, Donald Trump continues to enjoy unwavering loyalty from a significant portion of the Republican base. His path to victory will likely involve energizing his core supporters while reaching out to independents concerned about economic stability and national security. His challenge lies in expanding his appeal beyond his base to convince swing voters that his leadership can bring about a more stable and prosperous future.\n\nWhat Lies Ahead for the House and Senate?\n\nThe composition of Congress is as crucial as the presidential race in shaping the future of US policy. Currently, Democrats hold a slim majority in the House of Representatives, while the Senate is evenly split, with the Vice President casting the tie-breaking vote.\n\nHouse of Representatives: The battle for control of the House in 2024 will be fierce, with both parties targeting key battleground districts, especially in suburban areas. Republicans hope to capitalize on public dissatisfaction with the current administration to regain control of the House. Meanwhile, Democrats are focusing on healthcare, climate change, and economic recovery to defend their majority. Voter turnout and the ability to appeal to swing voters will be crucial in these competitive districts.\n\nSenate: The Senate races are equally significant, with both parties striving for control. Republicans are targeting vulnerable Democratic incumbents in swing states, while Democrats are looking to flip seats in states where demographic shifts could work in their favor. The outcome of these races will depend heavily on national political trends and the performance of the presidential candidates in crucial battleground states. Suppose Kamala Harris is the Democratic nominee and can energize turnout in states like Georgia, Arizona, and Pennsylvania. In that case, Democrats may have a better chance of retaining or expanding their slim majority in the Senate.\n\nThe Paradox of Felon Disenfranchisement and Presidential Eligibility\n\nOne of the most perplexing contradictions in American democracy is the fact that a convicted felon can be barred from voting yet still be eligible to run for the presidency. This paradox highlights the differing standards of voting rights and federal office eligibility.\n\nVoting Rights for Convicted Felons: In the United States, voting rights for convicted felons vary by state. Some states permanently disenfranchise felons, while others restore voting rights upon the completion of their sentence. The rationale behind disenfranchisement is often the belief that committing a severe crime forfeits certain civic rights, including the right to vote. However, this policy is contentious, as it disproportionately affects minority communities and raises questions about fairness in the democratic process.\n\nEligibility to Run for President: The US Constitution defines the eligibility requirements for the presidency: a candidate must be a natural-born citizen, at least 35 years old, and a resident of the U.S. for at least 14 years. Notably, the Constitution does not include any restrictions based on criminal history, meaning a convicted felon can technically run for and be elected president. The framers of the Constitution likely assumed that the electorate would use their judgment to elect suitable candidates, relying on the democratic process to filter out those deemed unfit for office.\n\nThis discrepancy underscores the complexities of American democracy, where principles of fairness, justice, and representation often clash with historical legal frameworks. As the nation progresses, these issues, among others, will continue to shape the national discourse.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe 2024 US presidential election is more than just a race between candidates; it reflects America\u2019s ongoing struggle with its identity, values, and role on the global stage. Whether the country is ready to elect its first female president or returns to the leadership of a familiar figure like Donald Trump, the outcome will have profound implications for the United States and the world. The composition of the House and Senate will also play a critical role in determining the legislative direction of the next administration. As the world watches, America stands at a crossroads where the decisions made in this election will shape its future for future generations.\n\nFacebook Twitter Linkedin Email Disclaimer Views expressed above are the author's own.",

Geoff Bennett discussed the decision with Teamsters General President Sean O'Brien.",

        "text": "Teamsters chief on why union won\u2019t endorse Trump or Harris: \u2018Our system is broken\u2019\nSean O\u2019Brien:\n\nIt certainly didn't help.\n\nLook, I will never, ever allow people to fire workers for exercising their right to strike or organize, and I will call balls and strikes like I have done all along. And former President Trump was out of line with his comments, and I expressed my feelings to him, but it resonated with our members, and that was one of the reasons that the international couldn't endorse President Trump either, amongst other reasons.\n\nWe didn't get a commitment on vetoing national right-to-work. And, conversely, with Kamala Harris, we didn't get a commitment on protecting our members' right to strike under the Railway Labor Act. So there were a lot of mitigating factors on why we didn't endorse nationally.\n\nAnd, look, by the polling alone that we did, our members sent a clear message to the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. We are getting attacked from the far left because we didn't make an endorsement, and the far right is not happy that we are working with some Republicans to try and get some things done.\n\nSo this is an opportunity for both parties, Democrats to reestablish their commitment and look back and say, something must be broken. Instead of looking to blame the leaders or the members, they should look in the mirror and say, how do we fix this? We were the working people party at one time.\n\nAnd it's an opportunity for Republicans, who claim they want to be the working people's party, it's an opportunity for them to prove it, support a version of the PRO Act, support bankruptcy reform, support issues that actually affect working people.\n\nAnd our system is broken, and it needs to be fixed. And the name-calling, the finger-pointing, it's got to end.",

Former President Donald Trump is well known and polarizing \u2014 people either love him or hate him. Vice President Harris is famous, but voters say they don\u2019t know her as well.\n\nPolls show an incredibly tight race between them, and a handful of swing voters could decide the election, depending on who they vote for or if they decide to stay home.\n\nOnly a tiny slice of the electorate is considered persuadable \u2014 anywhere from 6% or less to the low teens.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThere were nearly four dozen undecided voters in the NPR/PBS News/Marist poll in the last four months who gave permission to call them back to follow up. To understand their current thinking and motivations, NPR tried them all and got in touch with 10 by phone in the days following the Harris-Trump debate. What we found was notable.\n\nFirst, the debate was important for Harris. Most who watched said she performed better than Trump. They were not all moved to vote for her as a result, but four who seemed to need a degree of reassurance about Harris are now voting for her or leaning Harris\u2019 direction after the debate.\n\nAnd while undecided voters often have unique reasons for what influences their votes, there was a clear gender divide. All four who say they are now voting for or leaning toward Harris are women. That also reflects the wide gender gap seen in polls between the candidates.\n\nThe other six \u2014 one woman and five men \u2014 were a mix. Five said they likely won\u2019t be voting for Harris, most citing the economy or immigration as reasons. One other said he is still truly undecided, but said prices are a major concern. Two are leaning toward Trump; another said she aligns more with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.; a self-described progressive said he doesn\u2019t like Harris\u2019 stance on the war in Gaza; and one other, a conservative, said he might not vote at all.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nMany did not want to use their full names; some didn\u2019t want us to use any name at all. They cited security concerns. They said in this political environment, they were apprehensive about giving out too much personally identifiable information.\n\nHere\u2019s what they had to say:\n\n\n\nBrady, 30, Wisconsin, leaning Trump\n\nOn the debate, Brady said, \u201cKamala [Harris] did a better job articulating her points, obviously.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI don\u2019t want to go through another four years of a Trump presidency.\u201d\n\nBut his vote is largely contingent on his personal financial situation, and he noted, \u201cThings have gotten more expensive.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have probably a middle-class income for my family,\u201d he said, \u201cand it doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s getting any easier \u2014 even as my wife and I have advanced in our careers.\u201d\n\nBrady said he aligned more with former President Barack Obama and said he doesn\u2019t \u201clike her policies\u201d on the economy.\n\nAsked what specifically he doesn\u2019t like, he said, \u201cI can\u2019t say I\u2019m super knowledgeable about the specifics, but from a how-our-family-is-feeling standpoint, just not sure.\u201d\n\n\n\nLee, 59, Wisconsin, leaning Trump\n\nLee did not like how ABC handled the debate, specifically the fact-checking. He felt the moderators \u201cteamed up on Trump.\u201d\n\nHe felt Harris did almost too well, saying it was \u201calmost like rehearsed.\u201d But he said he \u201cnever got any message from Harris\u201d and said she \u201cskirted issues,\u201d including the Biden administration\u2019s \u201cinability to stop the flow of migrants\u201d and the economy.\n\n\u201cTrump stuck his foot in his mouth multiple times,\u201d Lee said, though.\n\nHe said he wanted to see Trump, whom he trusts more on the economy, debate again and was unaware that Trump had said he would not do another debate with Harris. When told that, Lee said he was \u201cdisappointed.\u201d\n\nHe said he\u2019s \u201cnot a big Republican, not a big Democrat.\u201d He voted for Sen. Bernie Sanders, the progressive independent from Vermont, in the 2016 primary and is now leaning toward Trump, independent Cornel West or the Green Party\u2019s Jill Stein (not from an environmental standpoint, however, because he thinks the Green New Deal \u201cwent too far\u201d).\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to piss away my vote,\u201d he said, pointing out that he is leaning most toward Trump because of that.\n\n\n\nWoman, declined to give name, 68, Oregon, undecided\n\nOf the debate, the respondent said, \u201cI was like, OK, who are these people? They were like bad actors. Kamala, suddenly she was so articulate when it\u2019s usually word salad. There was something weird going on there.\u201d\n\ntoggle caption Allison Joyce/Getty Images\n\nTrump, on the other hand, she said, it was like \u201csomething was in his water,\u201d and he wasn\u2019t his usual self.\n\nShe said this of her ideal ticket: \u201cIf RFK [Jr.] was on the ticket with [former Rep.] Tulsi Gabbard [of Hawaii], it would have been a slam dunk for me.\u201d\n\nOf Trump and Harris, she said: \u201cI am reluctant to vote for Trump, but I have absolutely no confidence about Kamala Harris\u2019 ability to do anything about the border at all. We\u2019re suffering for it.\u201d\n\nShe said she didn\u2019t vote in the 2020 election, and that she doesn\u2019t trust Trump fully, because he signed the CARES act, a COVID relief bill.\n\n\u201cHe is aesthetically lacking,\u201d she said, laughing, but \u201cthe major Trump haters are missing the whole point. They\u2019re not looking at issues; they\u2019re looking at personality.\u201d\n\n\n\nJene Proffitt, 45, Arkansas, leaning Harris\n\nProffitt did not see the debate or follow news about it afterward. She said she voted for Trump in 2016 and did not vote for president in 2020. But she is resolved to do so this time.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to go out and will vote this year,\u201d said Proffitt, a mother of five. \u201cIt\u2019s a right I should exercise. I want to show my kids that\u2019s a right.\u201d\n\nOf the candidates, she said she doesn\u2019t know much at this point about Harris\u2019 policy positions, but she is leaning her direction because of Trump.\n\n\u201cI feel Trump\u2019s disrespect for women is not befitting of a president,\u201d she said. \u201cHe is not someone I want my girls to look up to as a role model.\u201d\n\nAbout Harris, she added: \u201cShe\u2019s a woman, and maybe having a female president would do the country some good. \u2026 I gave the other guy a try, why not give her a try?\u201d\n\n\n\nSponsor Message\n\nPhyllis Bohlman, 76, Idaho, voting Harris\n\nA Republican and former interior decorator and rancher, Bohlman said she made the switch to vote Democratic when Trump came on the scene.\n\n\u201cNo, I have not voted for Trump, nor will I ever,\u201d Bohlman said. \u201cI have never been able to stand the guy since he came into the picture years ago. I even took a book away from my 16-year-old son that [Trump] had written about making money. He didn\u2019t make his money; he inherited it and lost it. He\u2019s not a good businessman. He\u2019s not anything but a narcissistic misogynist.\u201d\n\nShe was undecided in May, but is now locked in for Harris. She said she saw the debate and thought Harris performed well.\n\n\u201cI will vote Democrat,\u201d Bohlman said. \u201cI will vote for Kamala. I liked the way she came across in the debate. She is a very astute, intelligent woman, who knows exactly where she\u2019s going. She doesn\u2019t hinge her judgment on whether she likes someone or not.\u201d\n\nShe went on to cite the overturning of Roe v. Wade abortion protections, which she blames squarely on Trump, as another motivating factor for her to vote for Harris.\n\n\u201cI am so angry about that,\u201d she said of the Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs decision. \u201cIt\u2019s so unfair that a bunch of men are making decisions for women. I think it\u2019s horrific.\u201d\n\nBohlman also brought up the siege at the Capitol on Jan. 6, which she said was \u201cappalling,\u201d called out GOP leaders\u2019 hypocrisy in criticizing Trump initially and then trying to get back in his good graces, and she noted that she has lots of family members who are \u201cadamantly pro-Trump.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey do not look at the whole picture,\u201d she said of Trump supporters. \u201cI\u2019m sure after this second [assassination] attempt, they\u2019ll be saying, \u2018God is protecting him.\u2019 It\u2019s just a bunch of crock.\u201d\n\nAnnette, declined to give age, Illinois, voting Harris\n\nAnnette is a registered independent who generally votes Democratic. In June, she was undecided if she would vote at all because she was concerned about President Biden\u2019s age and ability to do the job.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t realize how bad he was,\u201d Annette said after watching Biden in the June 27 debate. \u201cHe lost his oomph. He made Trump look good.\u201d\n\nBut now, she is enthusiastically backing Harris.\n\n\u201cI would never vote for him,\u201d Annette said of Trump. She called herself \u201chappily surprised, maybe not surprised, but happy with [Harris\u2019] presentation\u201d at the debate. Annette said Harris proved she\u2019s \u201cperfectly capable.\u201d\n\n\n\nSponsor Message\n\nDr. Linda Remensnyder, 76, Illinois, voting Harris\n\nRemensnyder is a registered independent, but described herself as a \u201cRepublican at heart.\u201d\n\n\u201cI really liked Nikki Haley,\u201d Remensnyder said. \u201cI was hoping she would run [as the Republican nominee].\u201d\n\nThe retired audiologist voted for Trump in 2016 and then Biden in 2020. Remensnyder said she owned three doctors\u2019 practices. As a business owner, she said, \u201cI thought I could trust Trump. He was a businessman, but he was an absolute disaster\u201d from the start, Remensnyder said.\n\nAnd \u201cas a medical professional,\u201d she said she thought \u201cwhat he did with COVID was embarrassing.\u201d\n\nBut this time around, Remensnyder said she was \u201cdespondent\u201d at the choice between Biden and Trump. She felt Biden\u2019s mental fitness had declined too much to do the job any longer.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t trust him to run the government. \u2026 It really scared me,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen Harris entered, Remensnyder gave her a shot.\n\n\u201cI watched her,\u201d she said. \u201cI listened to her. I am a woman, and women\u2019s needs are first, even before party.\u201d\n\nRemensnyder is pro-abortion rights and said she liked how Harris has advocated for women\u2019s reproductive freedom, and she liked Harris\u2019 experience as a litigator.\n\nRemensnyder said she thought Harris did fairly well in the debate, but \u201cdid not answer most of the questions. She did skirt the issues. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s the best. I really, really wanted Nikki Haley.\u201d\n\nBut she added that she is \u201cconfident\u201d in Harris\u2019 ability to do the job, though not confident she will win because of the clear gender divide she sees. Remensnyder said her husband and son are conservative and tell her they are leaving the presidential line on the ballot blank.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t force themselves to vote Democratic,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nThiago, 21, New Jersey, undecided if he will vote\n\nA college student born in Brazil, he described himself as a progressive whose top issue is the war in Gaza.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cDonald Trump won\u2019t get my vote,\u201d Thiago said, pointing out that Trump\u2019s position on the war is a nonstarter.\n\nAfter Biden dropped out, he was waiting to see what Harris would do, but Thiago said her posture on Gaza \u201chasn\u2019t been a great one.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still undecided whether it\u2019s worth it to vote for Kamala, given her not-great stance on Palestine,\u201d Thiago said, \u201cand given she\u2019s reaching out more to conservatives than more-progressive members of her party.\u201d\n\nHe watched the debate and said Trump was \u201coff the ball in the same way Biden seemed entirely way too old and needing to step aside. Trump seemed to inherit that and seemed rattled by Kamala.\u201d\n\nEven if you\u2019re on Trump\u2019s side, Thiago said, it was \u201cobvious\u201d that \u201cTrump didn\u2019t do great in that debate.\u201d\n\nThiago said he\u2019s still going to vote down-ballot, but short of Harris saying she will cut off weapons shipments to Israel, he likely will leave the presidential line blank.\n\n\n\nRon Gideon, 61, Oklahoma, might not vote\n\nA registered Republican, Gideon voted for Trump in 2016, but didn\u2019t vote for him in 2020 \u201cbecause of some of the choices he made.\u201d He didn\u2019t specify which ones.\n\nOf Trump and Harris: \u201cThey both have their challenges.\u201d\n\nBut he won\u2019t be voting for Harris. \u201cI understand her economic plan,\u201d he said, \u201cbut her liberalism is a little bit too liberal.\u201d\n\nGideon added: \u201cThis might be a situation where neither one of them gets my vote.\u201d\n\n\n\nJohn, 58, Florida, undecided\n\nJohn is a registered independent originally from Nassau County, N.Y., and has a blue-collar background as the son of a firefighter. He considers himself a \u201cliberal union Democrat.\u201d He voted for Obama twice, even volunteered to \u201cwork the phones,\u201d he said, and thought former President Bill Clinton \u201cdid a great job as president.\u201d\n\nSponsor Message\n\nHe did not vote for Hillary Clinton in 2016 because of a personal experience; she didn\u2019t show to an event he was involved with planning. In 2020, he said his son, who was 5 then, essentially cast his ballot for Biden, because he wanted to vote for him.\n\nJohn said he\u2019s not following the current presidential race that much, but did watch \u201ca little bit\u201d of the debate. His biggest concerns are housing affordability, groceries and gas prices.\n\n\u201cTrump was cuckoo for saying that the dogs and cats were being eaten,\u201d John said, \u201cbut Kamala Harris wasn\u2019t really answering any of the questions,\u201d especially about the economy.\n\nJohn said he wants to see something put forward to \u201cstop the inflation.\u201d John also doesn\u2019t trust Harris (mispronouncing her name as \u201cCamilla\u201d at one point) because of her changed positions on things like fracking.\n\n\u201cI think Joe Biden did the best he could,\u201d John said. \u201cIf he could have just grabbed the horns on inflation \u2014 things are through the roof. \u2026 It\u2019s gone freakin\u2019 nuts.\u201d",

        "text": "Uncommitted movement declines to endorse Harris, but encourages against Trump, third-party votes\nThe Uncommitted movement, the pro-Palestinian group critical of the Biden administration's handling of the war in Gaza, announced Thursday that it will not endorse Vice President Kamala Harris, but also does not recommend a third-party vote in November.\n\nThe group made the announcement as Harris campaigns Thursday in Michigan, home to sizable Arab American and Muslim populations that could hold outsized sway this year in the crucial swing state. The movement was founded to push voters to vote \"uncommitted\" on primary ballots rather than punch a ticket for Biden to register their discontent with his tight support for Israel amid the bloody war in Gaza.\n\nThe group said in a statement that \"Harris's unwillingness to shift on unconditional weapons policy or to even make a clear campaign statement in support of upholding existing U.S. and international human rights law has made it impossible for us to endorse her.\"\n\nStill, the group added that it \"opposes a Donald Trump presidency, whose agenda includes plans to accelerate the killing in Gaza while intensifying the suppression of anti-war organizing\" and \"is not recommending a third-party vote in the Presidential election, especially as third party votes in key swing states could help inadvertently deliver a Trump presidency given our country's broken electoral college system.\"\n\n\"We urge Uncommitted voters to register anti-Trump votes and vote up and down the ballot. Our focus remains on building a broad anti-war coalition both inside and outside the Democratic Party,\" the group said.\n\nThe statement comes before Harris campaigns in Detroit, where she'll both rally with supporters and hold an event with Oprah Winfrey.\n\nDemonstrators protest in support of the Palestinian people outside of Northwestern High School where Democratic presidential candidate Vice President Kamala Harris is scheduled to speak to union workers, Sept. 2, 2024, in Detroit. Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nUncommitted has remained a thorn in the Democratic Party's side since the war in Gaza kicked off last year following Hamas' brutal attack on Israel, which killed about 1,200 people, according to Israeli officials. The Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health said more than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since the Israel-Hamas war began.\n\nThe group repeatedly criticized Biden, and Uncommitted votes in Democratic primaries raised concerns about cracks in the president's base of support, even before a ruinous June debate tanked his campaign. Uncommitted netted more than 100,000 votes in the primary in Michigan, where Trump won by about 11,000 votes in 2016.\n\nThe movement has demanded that Harris meet with Palestinian-American families who have lost family members in Gaza, as well as support an immediate cease-fire (which she has done) and an arms embargo on Israel (which she has said she opposes). Uncommitted activists also waged a sit-in at the Democratic National Convention after the party refused their demand to have a Palestinian speaker make an address.\n\nThe Harris campaign has said she will continue to meet with leaders from Palestinian, Muslim, Israeli and Jewish communities.\n\nHarris, for her part, has sounded a more empathetic tone than Biden about the civilian death toll in Gaza but has insisted on Israel's right to defend itself and refused to make the kind of policy shifts from Biden that the Uncommitted movement sought.\n\nHarris' campaign sounded a similar note in a statement, with a spokesperson vowing that she would \"work to earn every vote, unite our country, and to be a President for all Americans\" and \"will continue working to bring the war in Gaza to an end in a way where Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom and self-determination.\"\n\nDemocratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris speaks at a watch party at Cherry Street Pier after the presidential debate in Philadelphia, Sept. 10, 2024. Jacquelyn Martin/AP\n\nUncommitted organizers have also remained vociferously opposed to Trump, who has bear-hugged Israel and used \"Palestinian\" as a slur.\n\nThe war in Gaza has loomed large in Michigan given its electorate and tight statewide margins.\n\nA super PAC affiliated with Republicans is running ads in Michigan ZIP codes with heavy Muslim or Arab populations highlighting Harris' support for Israel and second gentleman Doug Emhoff's Judaism, a seemingly back-handed attempt to hurt support for the Democratic ticket there. Harris' campaign is also running digital ads targeted to heavily Arab neighborhoods in and around Detroit emphasizing her statement that she \"will not be silent about human suffering in Gaza.\"\n\nIn a sign of how contentious the war has been, critics of the administration's approach to Gaza have been in turn critical of each other.\n\n\"Translation: We can't endorse Kamala, even though we'd like to, because the community we claim to represent would tear us apart. So instead, we're going to publicly state that we don't support her while also not endorsing any alternative, effectively helping her win,\" Abandon Harris, another group that wants the U.S. to take a tougher stance in its relationship with Israel, said in a statement.\n\nJoekul Hara, left, leads pro-Palestinian demonstrators protest in support of the Palestinians who have died in Gaza outside of the Arab American National Museum, Aug. 11, 2024, in Dearborn, Mich. Jeff Kowalsky/AFP via Getty Images, FILE\n\nStill, Michigan Democrats touted Uncommitted's statement, particularly urging against third-party votes, as the best-case scenario for Harris given that the policy shifts they were asking for would have been difficult for the vice president to swallow.\n\nJim Ananich, the former Democratic state Senate leader in Michigan, dubbed the statement \"close to a win.\"\n\nJosh Hovey, a Michigan communications strategist, added that \"the best case would have been a full endorsement because the margin of victory will likely be very close again this year and Harris needs to win this state if she's going to win the Electoral College.\"\n\nBut \"this is the second-best scenario and sends a message to Harris that they need her to do more on this issue while also recognizing that her victory is the one that is most likely to result in the U.S. taking a stronger approach to addressing the humanitarian crisis,\" Hovey added.",

        "text": "Issa Rae Says Hollywood Is Waiting on the Election Amid Challenging Film and TV Landscape\nIssa Rae says she\u2019s continuing to work on building her own studio or a method of controlling distribution for her shows amid a lack of work in Hollywood and difficulty getting the green light for her projects..\n\nSpeaking at the Fast Company Innovation Festival in Manhattan Thursday, the Insecure star and creator noted that despite her success, several shows she has produced, including Rap Shit, Sweet Life and A Black Lady Sketch Show, have been canceled. The current landscape is very challenging, Rae said, adding that she believes the industry is also waiting on results of the U.S. presidential election.\n\n\u201cThe market has changed a lot, and we\u2019re all susceptible to it. There\u2019s no one that\u2019s not affected by it,\u201d Rae said. \u201cAnd a lot of the conversations even about this movie that we shot in LA is just how nothing is shooting in LA right now. And there isn\u2019t a lot of work. And my email is flooded every week with people saying, \u2018Hey, if you have anything, I\u2019m available.\u2019 It is hard, and it is a big, big waiting game just generally of figuring out what\u2019s going to happen to the industry,\u201d Rae said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had a great, great relationship with the partners now that I work with, and I love working with them. It\u2019s just that everybody, every single network, maybe with the exception of Netflix, is beholden to Wall Street right now. And I think after the elections, things will change because they\u2019ll know what\u2019s possible in a very, also scary way. The industry is just kind of waiting,\u201d she continued.\n\nRae is currently under a five-year overall deal with what was previously known as WarnerMedia when she signed the deal in 2021.\n\nThe writer and producer launched Hoorae Media, an independent media production company, in September 2020, with the goal of having more control over which projects are produced, with a particular emphasis on stories written by Black creatives and starring Black talent.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about making sure that we have hands on every part of the process. And that\u2019ll hopefully, ultimately lead to a studio, whether it\u2019s a network, whether it\u2019s some form of distribution, that is the North Star,\u201d Rae said. \u201cBut right now it\u2019s just a little bit at a time just prioritizing these stories. What I have seen is, and what we\u2019ve all seen just even in looking at the TV landscape right now, is that they\u2019re not a lot of Black stories on the air. And that\u2019s something that will always be at the center of what we make and who we consider. And I know that there are not a lot of networks out there or studios out there that feel the same way.\u201d",

        "text": "UMW Center for Leadership and Media Studies Survey Zooms in on Presidential Election in Virginia\nVice President Kamala Harris (D) and former President Donald Trump (R) are locked in a tight presidential contest in Virginia, according to a new statewide survey from the Center for Leadership and Media Studies at the University of Mary Washington.\n\nHarris has the support of 47 percent of 756 Virginia likely voters, as compared to 46 percent favoring Trump in the survey, which includes 1,000 adult respondents and was conducted for UMW\u2019s Center for Leadership and Media Studies by Research America Inc. Sept. 3-9. Several third party and independent candidates received a total of four percent support in the poll, while the remaining likely voters said they were undecided.\n\nIn a question that asked likely voters only about the major party nominees, the results also remained well within the margin of error: 48 percent favored Harris and 46 preferred Trump.\n\nAmong all survey respondents, the two major party nominees were tied at 44 percent each. Roughly five percent said they were undecided, with the remainder saying they support a third-party or independent candidate or were not planning to vote.\n\n\u201cThis new survey suggests Virginia should be getting a much closer look from both presidential campaigns,\u201d said Stephen J. Farnsworth, professor of political science at the University of Mary Washington and director of UMW\u2019s Center for Leadership and Media Studies. \u201cVirginia may deserve to be treated as a \u2018swing state\u2019 once again this year.\u201d\n\nThe survey, which concluded just before the presidential debate on Sept. 10, showed that Virginians were greatly concerned with a range of policy issues: 20 percent said the economy and jobs were the top concern, while 19 percent said inflation, 19 percent said threats to democracy, 13 percent said immigration and five percent said abortion. Republicans in the survey focused more on economic matters, while Democrats were more likely to be concerned about threats to democracy and abortion.\n\nFarnsworth noted that some Virginia surveys conducted in the weeks since Biden decided not to run for re-election have offered differing results. Some found a margin favoring Harris that was greater than the survey\u2019s margin of error, while others identified a very close presidential contest in Virginia.\n\n\u201cGiven the range of findings in Virginia surveys over the past two months, the Harris and Trump campaigns may be paying far too little attention to the Commonwealth,\u201d Farnsworth said. \u201cVirginians have a history of bouncing back and forth between the parties.\u201d\n\nFour years ago, former Vice President Biden (D) defeated Trump by a 10-point margin in Virginia. A year later, Republican Glenn Youngkin was elected governor by a 51 percent to 49 percent margin, Farnsworth said.\n\nVirginians in this new survey said they approved of Gov. Youngkin\u2019s job performance by a 46 percent to 34 percent margin. As for President Biden\u2019s job performance, 37 percent of survey respondents approved and 53 percent disapproved.\n\nThere is little evidence of partisan defections in the current presidential contest, with roughly 90 percent of partisans backing their own party\u2019s nominee. Virginians who said they were political independents were split roughly evenly between Trump and Harris.\n\nIn the two-candidate contest for Virginia\u2019s U.S. Senate seat, 49 percent of likely voters said they would favor Tim Kaine, the Democratic incumbent, and 43 percent support Hung Cao, the Republican challenger, with the rest undecided. In the entire 1,000-person sample, 45 percent favored Kaine and 38 percent backed Cao. The remainder were undecided.\n\nEarly voting in Virginia began on Friday, Sept. 20.\n\nFor further information, contact Professor Farnsworth at sfarnswo@umw.edu.\n\nFor more survey results, see Topline, All Survey Results and Likely Voter Results.\n\nSURVEY INFORMATION\n\nThe University of Mary Washington\u2019s Virginia Survey Fall 2024 was conducted by Research America Inc. between September 3 and September 9, 2024. The survey included a total of 1,000 Virginia residents (unweighted), consisting of 870 registered voters and 774 likely voters. The data collection was carried out through a mixed-mode approach: 600 respondents were contacted by phone (80% cell phones and 20% landlines), and 400 respondents were contacted via online panel.\n\nInterviews were conducted in English, and the final dataset was weighted to correct for known demographic discrepancies, including age, gender, and race/ethnicity, ensuring that the results are representative of the Virginia population.

        "text": "In-person voting begins for the US presidential contest, kicking off the sprint to Election Day\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 In-person voting for this year\u2019s presidential election began Friday, a milestone that kicked off a six-week sprint to Election Day after a summer of political turmoil.\n\nVoters lined up to cast their ballots in Minnesota, South Dakota and Virginia, the states with the first early in-person voting opportunities. About a dozen more states will follow by mid-October.\n\nAt a polling site in Minneapolis, Jason Miller arrived well before the polls opened at 8 a.m. and was first in line. He was among roughly 75 people who cast ballots in the first hour at the city\u2019s early voting center.\n\n\u201cWhy not try to be first? That\u2019s kind of fun, right?\u201d said the 37-year-old house painter.\n\nHe said he voted \u201cagainst crazy,\u201d but didn\u2019t want to name his choice for president.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I have to. I think that\u2019s pretty obvious. I think that\u2019s very, very clear,\u201d he said.\n\nThe beginning of in-person balloting follows a tumultuous summer in American politics that included President Joe Biden dropping out of the race and being replaced by Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee, and an assassination attempt against Republican nominee Donald Trump followed by another apparent attempt on his life just nine weeks later.\n\nAcross the country, local election directors are beefing up their security to keep their workers and polling places safe while also ensuring that ballots and voting procedures won\u2019t be tampered with. Officials and ordinary poll workers have been targets of harassment and even death threats since the 2020 presidential election.\n\nWhat to know about Trump\u2019s second term:\n\nStaffing the administration: Here are the people Trump has picked recess appointments Follow all of our coverage as Donald Trump assembles his second administration.\n\nFederal authorities are investigating the origin of suspicious packages that have been sent to or received by elections officials in more than 15 states in recent days, including Virginia.\n\n\u201cIf I could wave a magic wand in this room right now, I would wish for two things: Between now and November 5th, I want to see high turnout and low drama,\u201d Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon said during a news conference Thursday that previewed his state\u2019s efforts around the election season. Simon also serves as president of the National Association of Secretaries of State.\n\nSome voters suggested that the potential for trouble or chaos on Election Day was one reason not to wait.\n\nChris Burda, 74, said she is encouraging others to get their ballots in early \u201cto avoid potential disruption on Election Day or in-person voting by a certain party who seems to be interested in poll watching to the point of intimidation.\u201d She cast her ballot for Harris at a Minneapolis voting center, saying the vice president was \u201cstanding up for democracy and the freedom to choose.\u201d\n\nAs the start of early voting approached, Trump\u2019s rhetoric turned more ominous with a pledge to prosecute anyone who \u201ccheats\u201d in the election in the same way he falsely claimed they did in 2020, when he lied about widespread fraud and attacked officials who stood by their accurate vote tallies.\n\nTrump has previously sought to sow doubts about mail voting and encouraged voters to cast ballots in person on Election Day. But this year, Trump and the Republican National Committee, which he now controls, have begun to embrace early and mail voting as a way to lock in GOP votes before Election Day, just as Democrats have done for years.\n\nEugene Otteson, 71, a Vietnam War veteran and former mill worker, cast his early ballot for the former president in Anoka, Minnesota. He said he believes Trump will keep the country from intervening in foreign conflicts and will manage the economy like a business executive.\n\n\u201cNot that I like him, but he\u2019s a business person, and I like someone who can run a business,\u201d Otteson said. \u201cWith Kamala, you still don\u2019t know what she stands for \u2026 I hear her going around say \u2018joy, joy.\u2019 Well, I can say joy to the world, but that don\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to stop the wars going on.\u201d\n\nIn Virginia, early in-person voting has long been popular in many parts of the state.\n\nFairfax County Elections Director Eric Spicer said roughly a third of local voters came to the polls on Election Day during the 2020 presidential election, while the rest voted by mail or early and in-person. Mary Lynn Pinkerman, the elections director for the city of Chesapeake, expects early voting to help ease the crowds on Nov. 5 but also cautioned that with heavy interest in this year\u2019s presidential race, \u201cvoters could still encounter wait times\u201d on Election Day.\n\nAmong Virginians taking advantage of early voting Friday was Rocklyn Faher, a retired U.S. Navy aviation electrician who served in the first Gulf War. He became emotional when talking about casting his ballot in Norfolk for Harris. Fighting back tears, he spoke about preserving the Constitution and the future for his grandchildren.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m obviously very emotionally invested in this election,\u201d said Faher, 70. \u201cIt is the most important election of the last 100 years.\u201d\n\nFaher said he believes in protecting reproductive rights and likes Harris\u2019 plan to provide $25,000 for first-time homebuyers, while criticizing Trump\u2019s plan to impose tariffs on products from overseas.\n\nHe also said that Harris\u2019 overall proposals are \u201cbetter than herding 10 million naturalized and unnatural immigrants, documented or undocumented, into railroad cars and shipping them across the border into Mexico. That\u2019s insane.\u201d\n\nImmigration, and in particular the surge at the country\u2019s southern border over the past few years, also is animating those casting a ballot for Trump, who has promised mass deportations if he wins the presidency again.\n\nIsrael Chavez, 37, came to America from Peru as a 10-year-old with his father and sister. He voted for Trump because he believes the economy was stronger under the former president and he supports a harder line on immigration.\n\n\u201cI know how it is when you have an open border and let anyone in,\u201d he said after casting his ballot at a voting center in Anoka, Minnesota. \u201cMy dad brought us into the country legally. We had visas. He just did it right.\u201d\n\nIn Yankton, South Dakota, the county elections office saw a steady stream of people voting early immediately after it opened at 9 a.m., said Kasi Foss, the county\u2019s assistant auditor. That\u2019s unusual for the first day of early voting.\n\nShe said that while the office didn\u2019t have a line for voting, the office consistently had two or three people wanting to vote at all times.\n\nSouth Dakota voters are deciding the fate of several ballot initiatives on hot-button issues, including a proposed amendment to the state constitution to protect abortion rights and a measure that would legalize the recreational use of marijuana. But Foss said she believes the presidential race is driving turnout.\n\n\u201cNormally, on the first day, we\u2019ll have a couple of stragglers,\u201d she said.\n\nSome voters might opt for early in-person balloting instead of using mail ballots to ensure their votes get counted, given the ongoing struggles of the U.S. Postal Service.\n\nState and local election officials from across the country last week warned that problems with mail deliveries threaten to disenfranchise voters, and they told the head of the system that it hasn\u2019t fixed persistent deficiencies despite their repeated attempts at outreach.\n\nPostmaster General Louis DeJoy responded in a letter released Monday that he\u2019ll work with state election officials to address their concerns, but reiterated that the Postal Service will be ready.\n\nSimon, the Minnesota secretary of state, urged voters to make their voting plans now.\n\n\u201cMy hope and expectation is that the USPS will do the things that we have recommended, and do them quickly over the next 47 days because the stakes really are high for individual voters,\u201d Simon said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Olivia Diaz in Fairfax, Virginia, Jack Dura in Bismarck, North Dakota, Ben Finley in Chesapeake, Virginia, John Hanna in Topeka, Kansas, Michael Goldberg in Anoka, Minnesota, and Mark Vancleave in Minneapolis contributed to this report.",

        "text": "Summary of the U.S. Presidential Election Process\nThe Candidates\n\nAbout a year before the elections, candidates from the two main political parties, the Democrats and the Republicans, begin their campaign trails. They set up their teams and start \u201cgoing on tour\u201d around the country to rally for support and to fundraise for their campaigns.\n\nThe Debates\n\nAt the start of the campaigns, the candidates from both parties participate in televised debates. During the debates, each candidate will have to answer tough questions about their policies, as well as defend their stance on issues and policies against other candidates.\n\nThe Primaries and Caucuses\n\nBeginning in February, the main voting events, Primaries and Caucuses, will lead to a selection of delegates who will represent the people at the upcoming conventions. The main focus will be on the results from Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina, which can usually determine who the final presidential nominee for each party will be.\n\nThe Running Mates\n\nAround July, presidential nominee hopefuls will start announcing their choice of \u201crunning mate\u201d\u2014the individual who will become vice president if the nominee is elected president.\n\nThe National Conventions\n\nAt the National Conventions, state delegates from the primaries and caucuses, selected to represent the people, will now \u201cendorse\u201d their favorite candidates, and the final presidential nominee from each party will be officially announced at the end of the conventions.\n\nThe Electoral College\n\nThe Electoral College is a process in which electors, or representatives from each state, in numbers proportional to the state\u2019s population, cast their vote and determine who will be president. There are a total of 538 electors selected according to each state\u2019s policy. To win the presidency, the presidential nominee must receive at least 270 electoral votes.\n\nThe General Election\n\nWhen Americans go to the polls on November 5, they will select their favorite presidential candidate and running mate. Except in the states of Maine and Nebraska, if a candidate receives the majority of the votes from the people of a state, then the candidate will receive all electoral votes of that state. The presidential nominee with the most electoral votes becomes the President of the United States.",

        "text": "Election Season Efforts Serve a New Generation of Voters\nStony Brook\u2019s PEPCC Committee is creating outreach across campus\n\nIn a far-reaching effort to highlight the different ways students can participate in the upcoming election, Stony Brook\u2019s Presidential Election Planning and Coordination Committee (PEPCC) is offering several resources and engagement opportunities on campus.\n\nWhile the Center for Civic Justice (CCJ) is largely responsible for co-curricular civic engagement programming, PEPCC was originally introduced in 2020 to bring together partners outside of Student Affairs, including faculty, staff, students, undergraduate student government, and graduate student government. Since then, PEPCC has enhanced existing efforts and created new education and outreach outlets across campus, fostering an energy around democratic engagement and civic learning, with an emphasis on presidential election cycles.\n\n\u201cI think this is an unprecedented election in a lot of ways, and also for many of our students, their first time ever voting,\u201d said Ashley Liegi, assistant director for the Center for Civic Justice and co-chair of PEPCC. \u201cSome of our students are a little bit nervous or anxious to vote for the first time, so it\u2019s our goal to make the process as approachable as possible.\u201d\n\nLiegi shares chair duties with Emily Snyder, director of Student Community Development. Together they lead a 30-member team representing the entire university. \u201cPEPCC\u2019s composition was carefully curated in order to support the execution of an ambitious strategic plan for the 2024 election season,\u201d said Liegi.\n\n\u201cThe Presidential Election Planning and Coordination Committee has contributed to the development of high-quality, high-impact educational and social experiences to help us meet the needs of our diverse and dynamic campus community,\u201d added Snyder.\n\nPEPCC kicked off its slate of events September 10 with a watch party for the presidential debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, attended by more than 240 students. It was co-hosted by the College Democrats and the College Republicans, as well as the Political Science Society, and BridgeUSA\u2019s Stony Brook chapter.\n\n\u201cOur political student organizations are really excited to get involved and are helpful in cross-promoting non-partisan and intentionally bipartisan programming,\u201d said Liegi. \u201cThis event was a great way to kick off the election season. All of our students were really engaged. We had members from both political parties present, and a lot of collaborative work went into it.\u201d\n\nLiegi added both party organizations are willing to work together to get students engaged, registered and voting. \u201cIt\u2019s been a pleasure to work with the presidents of both organizations to really get the message out that we ultimately want our students to be active in the election season regardless of what their political views are.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur priority is to make sure our students are well informed as they prepare to voice their vote across the entirety of their ballot,\u201d said Snyder. \u201cInvolving campus partners has been integral to this effort. The colleagues and students involved with PEPCC have contributed valuable multidisciplinary perspectives, as well as a comprehensive understanding of who our students are and what will resonate with them as they participate in this important civic milestone.\u201d\n\nPEPCC hosted a campus National Voter Registration Day Drive on September 18, aimed at getting people registered to vote. Attendees had the opportunity to register to vote, check or confirm if their voter registration is active and up to date, apply for an absentee ballot to vote, and learn about important deadlines for voter registration, including how to vote early.\n\n\u201cI registered to vote about two years ago and I received an email a little bit after that saying there was a mistake I needed to correct,\u201d said Evangeline Tsevis, a junior from Queens majoring in psychology and linguistics. \u201cBut I felt a little intimidated to go to the CCJ office. I heard about this event, and it was super easy to come and just go up to the table. Everybody was really nice and helpful and I just filled out the form again.\u201d\n\nPEPCC has also created a Presidential Election Guidebook website, which serves as a central hub for all election information, serving students, staff, and faculty, with a variety of resources and information.\n\nThe COVID pandemic curtailed the group\u2019s initial efforts. \u201cA lot of the resources that we\u2019re providing this year in person were offered in either a hybrid format or in a virtual format, so the engagement was a little bit less,\u201d said Liegi.\n\nUpcoming PEPCC Events\n\nThe Center for Civic Justice is open Monday through Friday from 9 am to 5 pm to assist with voter registration, absentee ballot requests and more. Upcoming opportunities to register to vote include:\n\nThis year, PEPCC\u2019s efforts have shown immediate dividends; Liegi said more than 1,000 new voter registration forms were collected just from transferring commuter students during orientation in August.\n\n\u201cStony Brook just had one of its largest incoming classes, so we\u2019ve seen a lot more attendance at events from students,\u201d said Liegi. \u201cI think we\u2019re seeing the ripple effect of that, there\u2019s been a lot more in-person engagement and many more people are likely going to vote in person compared to 2020 which had a high number of voters mailing in ballots.\u201d\n\nLiegi did clinical social work in grad school, working in a substance abuse rehabilitation center for women, where she began to encounter victims of larger systemic issues that were not being addressed. \u201cThat was the light bulb moment for me where I was getting frustrated with seeing how these policies were impacting my clients,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat motivated me was the potential to figure out what was happening at the macro level, identifying the policies impacting larger communities and advocating for real change. So I started volunteering on political campaigns as a way to get more involved, which led to professional work in the field.\u201d\n\nLiegi said she enjoys seeing students become more engaged and creating positive change. \u201cAt the Center for Civic Justice, we try to make that connection for each individual student, because everyone\u2019s going to vote for a different reason, everyone\u2019s going to vote for a different candidate, everyone\u2019s going to have a different motivation that makes them show up in November. Finding what that reason is for each student has been the most successful way to get across how important it is to participate and not sit this election out.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis work doesn\u2019t happen in a vacuum, so having a team of faculty, staff and students who are invested in the core facets of these efforts \u2014 voter registration, education and mobilization \u2014 is imperative to our success,\u201d added Snyder. \u201cUltimately, the resources that have been developed are intended to serve our diverse campus community, from first time voters to seasoned faculty. The results of these elections will impact all of us. In the end, we strive to be good stewards of civic education and embrace the potential we have to build lifelong voters in our democracy.\u201d",

        "text": "Dataminr 2024 U.S. Election Security Checklist\nCybersecurity, Public sector, Security Operations\n\nThe 2024 U.S. presidential election is turning out to be a race like no other. And regardless which political party wins, it has been deemed a top risk\u2014one that \u201cwill be by far the most consequential for the world\u2019s security, stability, and economic outlook,\u201d according to Eurasia Group\u2019s Top Risks for 2024.\n\nIn fact, the first major election-related cyber attack has already occurred: a hack into the presidential campaign of GOP nominee Donald Trump. U.S. intelligence agencies have attributed the attack to Iran and warn that the country has stepped up its efforts to interfere with the presidential race.\n\nWith the U.S. elections almost here\u2014which include 60-plus national races and several at the state and local levels\u2014we\u2019re sharing our election preparedness checklist to help ensure security leaders and teams at both public and private organizations are fully prepared and able to protect people (voters, employees, customers), facilities and operations.\n\nU.S. Presidential Race: 162+ Million Ballots Approximately 244 million Americans are eligible to vote in this year\u2019s presidential election, based on numbers from the 2020 presidential race\u2014in which 66.6% of eligible voters participated\u2014we could see more than 162 million people cast their vote. (Bipartisan Policy Center)\n\nDataminr election security checklist\n\nEmploy CISA best practices\n\nLet\u2019s start with some of the best practices put forth by the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) as part of its #Protect2024 campaign\u2014a concerted effort to ensure safety across potential physical and cyber risks.\n\nBuild connections\n\nTo increase vigilance and accelerate response time, establish relationships with both public and private organizations including businesses surrounding election facilities (polling places, election offices and warehouses) and local authorities, first responders and emergency management teams. It\u2019s also important to connect with community leaders and organizations.\n\nPro tip: If you need support, contact your local CISA Protective Security Advisor (PSA)\u2014a security subject matter expert that can assist in securing critical infrastructure operations.\n\nPlan for physical security incidents\n\nAs with any large-scale event, ensure you have a well-established plan that outlines how you will respond to physical security incidents. This calls for maintaining situational awareness, applying any lessons learned from past events, and taking into account key factors such as traffic flows and evacuation routes.\n\nNote that stadiums, conventions centers and other large-scale sites do not have the same protections as government sites. Security teams can leverage CISA resources for recommendations on how to secure such facilities.\n\nConduct credential management\n\nEnsure your credentials are updated and you have implemented multi-factor authentication (MFA) to protect voter data and prevent unauthorized access. Don\u2019t forget to check that passwords used for systems handling election information are strong and unique.\n\nImplement network segmentation\n\nDon\u2019t overlook this critical cyber defense strategy. By dividing a network into distinct sections, organizations create virtual barriers against potential threats. Use this approach to ensure that if one segment of the network is compromised, other critical systems are not affected\u2014and limit lateral movement within the network.\n\nFortify against malware\n\nImplement rigorous email security measures, such as scanning attachments and links for malicious content, to prevent malware from infiltrating your network. Doing so effectively reduces the risk of infection and helps protect the integrity of the election infrastructure.\n\nEstablish baseline monitoring\n\nEstablish a baseline of normal network activity so that you can identify anomalies that might indicate a cybersecurity threat. This proactive approach allows for early detection of potential issues, enabling a swift response to mitigate risks and helping to protect election systems from unauthorized access and potential compromises.\n\nCritical election security questions to assess your readiness\n\nThe following questions will help you to assess your organization\u2019s election preparedness.\n\nIn cases where we have assets at or near a polling station, are we able to ensure that physical security threats will be surfaced and alerted on\u2014as they emerge and unfold?\n\nDo we have real-time visibility of physical security events that occur at polling locations across the country?\n\nDo we have the coverage needed to maintain situational awareness in the days after the election\u2014in both the physical and digital domains\u2014 but before official results have been finalized?\n\nDo we know the location of our facilities in proximity to historic flashpoint locations?\n\nAre we able to identify, in real time, voter data breaches?\n\nHave we identified critical suppliers, third-party providers and potential concentration risks that could affect our supply chains should a disruption occur?\n\nHave we considered bringing together a cross-functional group of leaders to discuss potential concerns and scenario planning?\n\nDo we have a communication plan in place to keep employees informed about potential security risks during the election period and in the days that follow?\n\nAre our cyber and physical security teams working in lockstep to identify potential cyber-physical risks?\n\nIn the event bad actors attempt to capitalize on the election by launching an infrastructure-disrupting cyber attack, do we have a response plan for outages and other disruptions caused by mass deployed software technologies?",

Harris has said that she will support Israel\u2019s right to defend itself while also calling the suffering in Gaza \u201cdevastating.\u201d\n\nTrump repeatedly reiterated his past criticisms of the majority of Jewish voters who\u2019ve historically supported Democrats.\n\n\u201cAnybody who\u2019s Jewish and loves being Jewish and loves Israel is a fool if they vote for a Democrat,\u201d Trump said, telling Harris supporters, \u201cYou should have your head examined.\u201d\n\nThe remarks have sparked pushback from Jewish groups\n\nIn a thread on X, Amy Spitalnick, CEO of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs, called on Trump to, \"Stop labeling those who don't support you as crazy or disloyal,\" and accused him of playing into antisemitic tropes that will \"lead to (more) violence against Jews.\"\n\nIn a statement, Jonathan A. Greenblatt, CEO & National Director of the Anti-Defamation League, echoed the concern.\n\n\"Preemptively blaming American Jews for your potential election loss does zero to help American Jews. It increases their sense of alienation in a moment of vulnerability when right-wing extremists and left-wing antizionists continually demonize and slander Jews,\" he said, adding that Trump's comments could \"spark more hostility and further inflame an already bad situation.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nSpitalnick also criticized Trump's statements about immigrants from the Middle East, and his pledge to reinstate the policy known as the \"Muslim ban\" by refusing refugees from countries he described as \"terror-infested areas like the Gaza strip.\"\n\nSpitalnick wrote: \"If the antisemitism wasn't enough, he coupled it with full-on Islamophobia & racism.\"\n\nFrom the stage, Trump also told a story about a moment that shaped his understanding of domestic politics surrounding Israel. During his early days of campaigning for the Republican nomination, during a visit to Iowa in 2015, Trump said he was speaking to a group of \u201cvery religious Christians.\u201d\n\nTrump said he was surprised when his host encouraged him to \u201csay something good about Israel.\u201d\n\n\u201cI said my, my, my, how things have changed,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump went on.\n\n\u201cAnd I said, \u2018We love Israel; we will save Israel; and we will fight with Israel,\u2019 and the place went wild. I said, \u2018What the hell is going on?\u2019\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey love Israel. I hate to say it, sometimes they love Israel much more than Jewish people in New York love Israel.\u201d\n\nTrump's remarks were the latest in a long history of accusing Jewish Democrats of being disloyal to Israel.\n\nPolls suggest that while a majority of Americans as a whole express support for the Jewish state, white evangelicals are among the most supportive groups. American Jews overwhelmingly say Israel\u2019s reasons for fighting Hamas are valid, although younger Jews are more divided in their opinions about Israel\u2019s response to the October 7 attack.\n\nMany Jewish voters in the audience expressed support for Trump\n\nPerri Finkelstein, a 33-year-old American-Israeli dual citizen who lives in Israel, told NPR that her top voting priority is \u201cwhoever\u2019s going to do right by Israel.\u201d Finkelstein said she appreciated several of Trump\u2019s policy decisions, including recognizing Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital and moving the U.S. Embassy there from Tel Aviv.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I have to like him in order to know that he\u2019s gonna do right by my country,\u201d she said.\n\nBut Danny Eisenberg, 73, a radiologist from Maryland, called Trump\u2019s statements about Jewish voters \u201ccrazy\u201d and \u201ca little antisemitic,\u201d adding that he believes Trump\u2019s promises about supporting Israel are exaggerated. Eisenberg told NPR he believes Trump\u2019s decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal had led to further instability in the region.\n\nTrump's address to the Israeli-American Council comes just weeks after a 23-year-old Israeli-American, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, was found shot dead in a Hamas tunnel in Gaza, along with the bodies of five other hostages.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nOther featured speakers scheduled for the three-day conference taking place this weekend include Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York and Republican megadonor Miriam Adelson.",

        "text": "Kamala Harris joins Oprah Winfrey for star-studded election event\nUnited States Vice President Kamala Harris has appeared in a talk show-style event hosted by television legend Oprah Winfrey, the Democratic candidate\u2019s latest bid to reach undecided voters in an election campaign that has shunned traditional media.\n\nThe livestreamed \u201cUnite for America\u201d event held in Michigan on Thursday featured a host of celebrities, including Jennifer Lopez, Chris Rock, Julia Roberts and Meryl Streep, alongside other Americans who had been personally touched by key elections issues including abortion and guns.\n\nHarris began her discussion with Winfrey by casting her campaign as a movement for unity.\n\n\u201cI think in this moment where we\u2019ve dealt with so much that I think is quite exhausting, around powerful forces that would try and divide us, and would try to have us as Americans pointing fingers at each other, that this movement that is about reminding each other that we have so much more in common than what separates,\u201d Harris said.\n\nPraising the Democratic candidate for \u201cstepping into her power\u201d, Winfrey asked Harris about the newfound confidence she appeared to gain after replacing President Joe Biden on the ticket.\n\n\u201cYou know we each have those moments in our lives when it\u2019s time to step up,\u201d Harris said.\n\n\u201cI felt a sense of responsibility, to be honest with you, and with that comes a sense of purpose,\u201d she added.\n\nHarris then discussed her pledges on key issues such as the economy, reproductive rights and immigration, including tax incentives she has proposed to create an \u201copportunity economy\u201d.\n\n\u201cPart of my plan is to give start-up small businesses a $50,000 tax deduction to start up their small business. Right now, it\u2019s $5,000. Nobody can start a small business with $5,000,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Democrat, who is a former prosecutor, also reached out to gun owners, a slice of the electorate that has traditionally voted in greater numbers for the Republican Party.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a gun owner, Tim Walz is a gun owner,\u201d Harris said, referring to her running mate.\n\n\u201cIf somebody breaks in my house they\u2019re getting shot,\u201d Harris added with a laugh. \u201cI probably shouldn\u2019t have said that, but my staff will deal with that later.\u201d\n\nDuring the event, Winfrey also introduced several people in audience to discuss gun control and reproductive rights, including Hadley Duvall, a 22-year-old Kentucky woman who became an abortion rights activist after she was impregnated at age 12 as a result of sexual abuse by her stepfather.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t wait until it\u2019s too late to care about reproductive healthcare, because then it\u2019s too late,\u201d Duvall said.\n\nHarris has largely eschewed traditional media appearances since becoming the Democratic nominee, leading critics to accuse her of ducking tough questions about her record and agenda.\n\nOn Thursday, Axios reported that Harris and Walz were on track to do fewer interviews and press conferences than any other ticket in modern US history.\n\nHarris and Walz have participated in just seven interviews and press conferences, compared with more than 70 such engagements by former US President Donald Trump and his running mate JD Vance, according to Axios.\n\nOpinion polls suggest that Harris and Trump are in a tight race for November\u2019s election.\n\nIn a New York Times/Siena poll released on Thursday, Harris and Trump were tied at 47 percent, although the Democratic candidate led by four points in the key battleground state of Pennsylvania.",

This is reportedly the largest lead any presidential candidate has registered in any weekly Economist/YouGov poll in nearly a year, since US President Joe Biden led Trump by 45% to 40% in the September 23-26, 2023 poll.\n\nBefore the debate, Harris - who replaced her boss, Biden, as Democrat nominee - was leading by two percentage points in the Economist/YouGov poll.\n\nReal Clear Politics, which gave Harris a 1.4-point lead over her 78-year-old opponent on September 10, has now increased it to two points (49.3 percent to 47.3) as of September 19.\n\nAccording to polling aggregator FiveThirtyEight, the Democrat is now ahead by about three percentage points, which was two points before the debate.\n\nSilver Bulletin also said that Harris is now leading Trump by over three points.\n\nThe debate, hosted by ABC News, attracted over 67 million television viewers, according to Nielsen data, topping the roughly 51 million people who watched Trump debate then-candidate Biden in June.\n\nBiden's disastrous performance in that debate had forced the 81-year-old leader to drop his re-election bid, which he did in July.",

        "text": "Harris challenges Trump to second US presidential debate\nDonald Trump says \u2018too late\u2019 to hold another debate as early voting has started ahead of November 5 election.\n\nKamala Harris has challenged Donald Trump to a second debate before the United States presidential election, saying she \u201cwill gladly accept\u201d to go head-to-head again against the former president.\n\nIn a statement on Saturday, Harris\u2019s campaign spokesperson Jen O\u2019Malley said the US vice president had accepted CNN\u2019s invitation to a debate on October 23.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to Vice President Harris again having the opportunity in the CNN debate to show her command of the issues and why it\u2019s time to turn the page on Donald Trump and charge a new way forward for America,\u201d O\u2019Malley said.\n\nMore than 67 million people tuned in to the first Harris-Trump showdown on September 10, which saw the two candidates trade barbs on immigration, foreign policy, and other issues.\n\nMost observers crowned Harris the winner of that debate, as she repeatedly appeared to rattle Trump over the course of the evening.\n\nI will gladly accept a second presidential debate on October 23. I hope @realDonaldTrump will join me. https://t.co/Trb8HUBsDh \u2014 Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) September 21, 2024\n\nTrump had posted on his Truth Social media platform earlier this month that, \u201cTHERE WILL BE NO THIRD DEBATE!\u201d\n\nTrump echoed that at a campaign rally in North Carolina on Saturday, saying it was \u201ctoo late\u201d to hold another showdown with Harris.\n\n\u201cThe problem with another debate is that it\u2019s just too late, voting has already started,\u201d he said, as reported by US news outlets.\n\nWhile election day is November 5, early voting began this week in some US states.\n\nIn 2020, the final presidential debate ahead of the election was on October 22. Four years earlier, when Trump went up against Democrat Hillary Clinton, the third and final presidential debate was on October 19.\n\nCNN has said the proposed October 23 debate would mirror the format of one held in June between Trump and Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nBiden\u2019s poor performance in that debate spurred questions about his age and ability to serve another term, and weeks later, he dropped out of the 2024 race.\n\n\u201cBoth Vice President Harris and former President Trump received an invitation to participate in a CNN debate this fall as we believe the American people would benefit from a second debate between the two candidates for President of the United States,\u201d CNN said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to receiving a response from both campaigns so the American public can hear more from these candidates as they make their final decision.\u201d\n\nClose race\n\nMost polls show Trump and Harris locked in a close fight in the run-up to the upcoming vote, particularly in battleground states that will be key to winning the White House.\n\nAccording to a New York Times polling tracker, Harris on Saturday held a slim lead of 49 percent support nationally compared with Trump\u2019s 47 percent support.\n\nIt is not clear whether debates actually have an effect on presidential campaigns, with most experts saying the impact is minimal.\n\nNevertheless, Elaine Kamarck and William A Galston, election experts at the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington, DC, said the September Harris-Trump debate appeared \u201clikely to put new wind in Harris\u2019 sales\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhether it will be enough to propel her to victory in the Electoral College remains to be seen. But her campaign and supporters leave the debate with renewed energy and hope,\u201d they wrote.\n\n\u201cBy contrast, the Trump campaign must reckon with the likelihood that their candidate\u2019s performance pleased his base without rallying many new supporters to his side.\u201d",

        "text": "What is early voting in US presidential elections? All to know in 500 words\nAdvocates say early voting makes elections more inclusive, but the practice has been the target of false fraud claims.\n\nElection day in the United States may still be several weeks away, but Americans in several parts of the country are getting a chance to cast their ballots already.\n\nIn-person, advanced voting became possible in the US states of Minnesota, South Dakota and Virginia this week while several other states opened up their mail-in voting processes earlier this month.\n\nBoth are forms of \u201cearly voting\u201d, a mainstay of US elections that in recent years has become a target of false voter fraud accusations.\n\nRights advocates say robust early voting opportunities help ensure more people can cast a ballot regardless of disability, time constraints, work, travel or other factors that could hamper them on election day, which this year is on November 5.\n\nEarly voting also offers an opportunity to build enthusiasm: When Taylor Swift, who recently endorsed Democratic candidate Kamala Harris, announced she would perform in Florida just before early voting begins there in October, local Democrats quickly seized on the moment.\n\n\u201cTaylor is bringing the Eras Tour to Miami in the weekend leading up to early voting, and I look forward to seeing that energy play out in Florida!!!\u201d the Miami-Dade Democratic Party said.\n\nSo how does early voting work?\n\nVoting in US presidential elections is only broadly steered by the federal government. US states determine much of how the logistics of the vote plays out in their respective jurisdictions.\n\nCurrently, every state in the country allows some form of early voting, with mail-in voting the most prevalent option.\n\nAt least eight of the 50 states send all registered voters a ballot in the mail while 14 still require voters to provide a reason for why they need to cast their ballot \u2013 sometimes known as an \u201cabsentee ballot\u201d \u2013 by mail.\n\nMost states also provide in-person voting before election day. Only three states do not.\n\nHow many Americans vote early?\n\nThat depends on the year.\n\nIn the 2020 election, which took place during the COVID-19 pandemic, more than 100 million voters cast their ballots before election day \u2014 representing about two-thirds of all Americans who voted that year, a record.\n\nAmericans living abroad, members of the US military and people with disabilities are among the many who have traditionally chosen to vote early.\n\nA 2001 Supreme Court ruling upheld that voters did not need to provide a reason to cast an early ballot, as long as their state allows it.\n\nWhy is early voting controversial then?\n\nEarly voting \u2014 in particular, mail-in voting \u2014 was at the centre of unfounded election fraud claims in 2020.\n\nThat\u2019s because Democrats have historically cast more votes by mail than Republicans, who are more likely to vote on election day. Many jurisdictions count votes cast in person before they begin counting mail-in votes although the process varies.\n\nThat can create a \u201cblue shift\u201d or \u201cred mirage\u201d, in which early results in key states appear to initially show the Republican candidate leading, only to shift to the Democratic candidate as the mail-in votes are counted.\n\nIn 2020, then-President Donald Trump falsely said the mail-in voting system was rife with fraud. The Republican ultimately lost the election to Democrat Joe Biden, but he has continued to claim the vote was stolen from him.\n\nMany state legislatures enacted new restrictions on early voting after the 2020 contest, including higher scrutiny for ballots cast by mail.\n\nBut the Republican Party has more fully embraced early voting this year as Trump runs again against Democratic candidate Kamala Harris.",

        "text": "Understanding how the US presidential election works\nOn November 5, some 244 million Americans are expected to head to the polls to choose their next president. Le Monde takes a closer look at how this complex election is organized.\n\nFour candidates, two front-runners and a race altered by the withdrawal of Joe Biden\n\nThis year's election features Democrat Kamala Harris, the current vice president who took over from Joe Biden on July 21 and turns 60 on October 20, running against Republican Donald Trump, 78, who is embroiled in a series of court cases. Trump and Harris have chosen JD Vance, 40, and Tim Walz, 60, respectively, as their running mates.\n\nIn New York, during the broadcast of the televised debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, on September 10, 2024. LEONARDO MUNOZ / AFP\n\nIn addition to the two main candidates, Jill Stein is running for the Green Party, having previously run in 2012 and 2016, while Howie Hawkins was their candidate in 2020. Chase Oliver is the Libertarian Party candidate. Meanwhile, Robert Kennedy Jr., son of former attorney general Robert Kennedy and nephew of President John F. Kennedy, has suspended his independent campaign and endorsed Trump.\n\nAn indirect election, where 538 electors choose the president\n\nThe US presidential election is based on indirect universal suffrage. While voters mark their ballot for the presidential candidate of their choice, they are actually choosing 538 electors who make up the Electoral College. The electors, after a lengthy process, ultimately vote to determine the president. A candidate needs at least 270 of these electoral votes to win the presidency.\n\nEach state is allocated a number of electors equivalent to its representation in Congress, which consists of two chambers: 100 senators (two per state) and 435 representatives, the number of representatives is based on the state's population. Additionally, the District of Columbia (Washington D.C.), the federal capital, has three electors, though it does not have senators or representatives due to its unique status.\n\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause 2 of the US Constitution states that \"no senator or representative, or person holding an office of trust or profit under the United States shall be appointed an elector.\" Each state has its own process for selecting electors, typically rewarding individuals for their loyalty to the party or service to the candidate.\n\nIn 48 of the 50 states and the District of Columbia, the candidate with the most votes wins all the state's electors under the winner-take-all system. Maine and Nebraska, however, use a different approach that includes proportional representation: one elector is chosen in each \"congressional\" district based on the popular vote, and two electors are selected based on the overall state result.\n\nThe 2020 census results changed the composition of the Electoral College and the distribution of seats in the House of Representatives. Texas gained two additional seats in Congress and, thus, two more electors (it now has 40). Colorado (10), Florida (30), Montana (4), North Carolina (16) and Oregon (8) each gained a seat. By contrast, seven states lost one electoral vote each: California (54), Illinois (19), Michigan (15), New York (28), Ohio (17), Pennsylvania (19) and West Virginia (4).\n\nVoting begins several weeks before November 5\n\nPreparing absentee ballots in Raleigh, North Carolina, on September 5, 2024. JONATHAN DRAKE / REUTERS\n\nAlthough November 5 is the last day Americans can vote, in practice, several million will have already cast their ballots through mail-in voting or early voting.\n\nIn North Carolina, absentee ballots began going out on September 6. During the 2020 election, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the total number of absentee ballots was 66.4 million (up from 28.8 million in 2016), according to the MIT Election Data + Science Lab, a research center focused on improving election science and administration in the United States. The Federal Election Commission reported that more than 158 million votes were cast in total in 2020, with absentee ballots accounting for 42% of the total. This percentage fell by 10 points in 2022, with 32% of voters choosing this method in the mid-term elections. During the 2020 presidential election, Trump called absentee voting \"fraud,\" despite the fact that it has long been used and cases of fraud are minimal.\n\nRead more Subscribers only The Trump campaign's orchestrated lies\n\nEarly voting is allowed in 47 states, as well as the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, according to the bipartisan National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL). In most states, voters do not need to provide a reason for choosing early voting, according to the federal government information site. However, \"in some states, you may need to request an absentee ballot to be able to vote early.\" Only \"three states \u2013 Alabama, Mississippi and New Hampshire \u2013 do not offer early in-person voting, though they may provide options for eligible absentee voters,\" according to NCSL.\n\nA decentralized process\n\nThe United States is a federal system where the electoral process is highly decentralized \u2013 it is organized by states, counties or cities. No two places manage elections in exactly the same way, as each has its own election laws, and there can be significant differences in the way elections are run.\n\nEach state sets its own voter registration deadlines, early voting dates and absentee voting rules, particularly for military personnel deployed overseas or at sea. They also determine how absentee ballots are to be cast (by mail, at drop-off points or at county electoral offices), as well as the opening dates of polling stations for early voting in all counties. There may even be variations within the same state.\n\nBallot counting\n\nOn election night, after polling stations have closed, election staff count as many ballots as possible, but the initial results are unofficial and, in many cases, may differ from the final results.\n\nAt the local level, election officials generally start with ballots cast on November 5, then move on to mail-in ballots. Each state has different rules regarding when mailed ballots, provisional ballots (issued when authorities cannot immediately determine whether a person is eligible to vote), military and overseas ballots can be counted. For example, some states require all mailed ballots to be counted before election day. Others allow mail-in ballots to be counted if they are postmarked before election day and received by a specified date.\n\nWhat results are available when voting ends, and are they reliable?\n\nOn polling day, voting stations generally open between 5:00 and 7:00 am and close between 6:00 and 8:00 pm, in three time zones. Counting begins after the polls close.\n\nIn general, the winner is known at 11:00 pm Eastern time (5:00 am in Paris), after the polls close in the western states.\n\nIn 2020, due to the surge in absentee voting, the counting and reporting of results was delayed in some swing states, where results are often close and can swing from one party to the other in each election. The Decision Desk HQ website announced Biden's victory shortly before 9:00 am Eastern time on November 6. Three and a half days after the election, on November 7, the major US TV networks declared Biden the winner: CNN was first, at 11:24 am Eastern time, followed quickly by NBC, CBS, ABC and the Associated Press (AP). Fox News confirmed the result at 11:40 am.\n\nTraditionally, AP plays a crucial role in counting votes and declaring the winner of US elections. The agency says it has around 4,000 temporary correspondents across the country, who gather results at the local level. Other correspondents monitor announcements on official county and state websites to record results.\n\nAP does not make projections and only declares a winner when it can conclusively determine that a candidate has won and that his or her opponent cannot catch up on the basis of the remaining ballots. For AP, no election is official until all votes have been counted and the election results are certified. The agency claims to \"emphasize accuracy over speed.\"\n\nAP also explained that it no longer uses exit polls to announce results, believing that interviewing voters at polling stations no longer provides a complete picture of the electorate. Instead, it supplements the vote count with an extensive survey of registered voters, conducted in the days before polls close.\n\nIn contrast, CNN, NBC, ABC and CBS rely on both real-time results and exit poll data. To this end, the four networks work with Edison Research through the National Election Pool.\n\nMeanwhile, election officials across the country, in cities, counties and sometimes states, count and publish voting results.\n\nCertification of the vote, from the states to Congress\n\nCertification of election results is conducted at the state level by the Secretary of State or Governor, and procedures and deadlines vary. Under the Electoral Count Act of 1877, states have a \"safe harbor period\" of five weeks after Election Day (until December 11) to resolve any election-related disputes and allow the Electoral College electors to meet on December 17.\n\nBy law, the electors meet in their respective state capitals and in the District of Columbia \"on the first Tuesday after the second Wednesday in December\" to cast their official votes for president and vice president. Each state must then submit its final results to the Electoral College and provide a certificate of ascertainment, a document that attests to the validity of the votes and the counting process.\n\nFinally, on January 6, 2025, the electoral votes will be officially counted at a joint session of Congress, and the president of the Senate will announce the election results. The winner of the November 5 election will enter the White House on Inauguration Day, January 20, 2025, at noon, for a four-year term.\n\nOther elections\n\nOn November 5, Americans will elect not only a president but also 468 members of Congress: 34 Senators and all 435 seats in the House of Representatives. They will also vote in a variety of local elections, including governors for 11 states and two territories, attorneys general for 10 states, mayors and local referendums.\n\nLocal and national legislative and policy proposals, as well as citizen initiatives, may also be put to the vote on this day. In Montana, for example, voters will decide whether or not to protect abortion rights in the state's constitution. In Arizona, voters will decide whether to extend the deadline for legal abortions. A total of eight states, including Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Nevada, New York and South Dakota, are expected to hold a referendum on abortion in the November election. The official results of these consultations will be made public once the vote certification process has been completed.",

Latest Guardian 10-day polling averages survey shows Harris increasing her lead to 2.6 points, 48.5% to 45.9%. That is an improvement of the 0.9% edge Harris held last week .",
        "text": "Harris ups lead over Trump, although presidential race still on knife-edge\nThe US presidential election remains on a knife-edge 45 days before voters go to the polls, despite Kamala Harris enjoying one of her most encouraging spells of opinion polling since becoming the Democrats\u2019 nominee nearly two months ago.\n\nDuring yet another momentous week that began with a suspected second assassination attempt against Donald Trump, the latest Guardian 10-day polling averages survey shows Harris increasing her lead to 2.6 points, 48.5% to 45.9%.\n\nWhile still within error margins, that is an improvement of the 0.9% edge Harris held last week and a significant shift from the statistical dead heat of a fortnight ago before the candidates held their only scheduled televised debate in Philadelphia on 10 September.\n\nPolling suggests voters, by large majorities, believe Harris won that encounter \u2013 when Trump, the Republican nominee and former president, effectively self-sabotaged by going on off-topic digressions about crowd sizes at his rallies and making universally debunked claims about Haitian immigrants eating pets.\n\nA New York Times/Philadelphia Inquirer/Siena nationwide poll on Thursday showed the candidates tied at 47% \u2013 actually a slight improvement for Harris on the same survey taken before the debate, when Trump recorded a one-point lead.\n\nOther national polling has been more positive for Harris. A Morning Consult poll \u2013 based on more than 11,000 respondents \u2013 gave her a six-point advantage, 51% to 45%, the biggest she had established since replacing Joe Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket.\n\nThere are other underlying trends giving Harris reasons to be cheerful, albeit cautiously.\n\nOne is her buoyant performance in battleground states, the key arenas in determining the result of the 5 November election under America\u2019s electoral college system.\n\nThe same New York Times/Siena poll that had the two candidates deadlocked nationally showed Harris with a four-point advantage, 50%-46%, in Pennsylvania, a swing state that many commentators identify as the most important of all in reaching the 270 electoral votes needed to capture the White House.\n\nThe survey is supported by a separate poll from Quinnipiac, which shows Harris with a six-point lead in the state, 51% to 45%\n\nMoreover, the Quinnipiac poll gives Harris leads in two neighbouring battlegrounds, Michigan and Wisconsin, 5% and 1% respectively.\n\nCapturing all three states \u2013 sometimes termed the \u201cblue wall\u201d by Democrats \u2013 would be enough to secure Harris a tiny electoral college victory without her needing to win any of the four southern Sun belt states (North Carolina, Georgia, Nevada and Arizona), where the two candidates are statistically tied.\n\nYet amid the optimism, there is a note of caution for the vice-president; Trump significantly over-performed pollsters\u2019 predictions in the blue wall states in the last two elections, capturing all three in 2016 and losing each by around a single percentage point in 2020, when polls had put Biden much further ahead.\n\nNevertheless, pollsters detect a change from previous elections that is working in Harris\u2019s favour \u2013 and which is whittling away the Republicans\u2019 assumed advantage in the electoral college, where Trump won in 2016 despite receiving 2.7m fewer votes nationwide than Hillary Clinton, his opponent.\n\nNate Cohn, the New York Times\u2019s chief polling analyst, called Harris\u2019s lead in Pennsylvania while tying with Trump nationwide \u201ca puzzle\u201d but said it was consistent with most other surveys.\n\n\u201cOver the last month, a lot of these polls show Ms Harris doing relatively poorly nationwide, but doing well in the Northern battleground states,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s clear is that recent results from higher-quality polls are very different from those of the last presidential election. If true, it would suggest that Mr Trump\u2019s advantage in the Electoral College, relative to the popular vote, has declined significantly since 2020.\u201d\n\nHarris has one other apparent reason for self-congratulation; the deficit with Trump over which candidate is trusted on the economy has been closed.\n\nThe economy remains the single biggest issue in the eyes of most voters, surveys show \u2013 recalling the mantra \u201cit\u2019s the economy, stupid\u201d coined by James Carville, the Democratic operative who helped chart Bill Clinton\u2019s 1992 election victory.\n\nYet the large lead Trump held over Biden \u2013 amid persistent concerns over inflation and rising living costs \u2013 seems to have eroded since Harris was nominated, separate surveys show.\n\nAn Associated Press-Norc poll published on Friday showed 41% of voters trusted Harris as a steward of the economy, while 43% gave Trump the nod \u2013 a nominal gap given the ex-president\u2019s attempts to tar his opponent with Biden\u2019s unpopular economic record.\n\n4:43 The second 2024 US presidential debate for Trump, the first for Harris \u2014 and factchecks - video\n\nThe results bore out an earlier Morning Consult study, which tied the candidates at 46% on economic trust, while an FT-Michigan Ross survey conducted after the debate even gave Harris a small lead.\n\nSofia Baig, an economist and author of Morning Consult\u2019s study, said Harris had successfully evaded blame for Biden\u2019s policies while winning over voters with her pledges to crack down on price gouging and prescription drug costs.\n\n\u201cWhile many voters are unsatisfied with the current economy, they say Vice President Kamala Harris is less responsible than President Biden,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThroughout this election cycle, voters consistently said they trusted former President Trump over Biden to handle the economy, but Harris has closed that gap.\u201d",

        "text": "U.S. Presidential polls: In-person voting begins, kicking off the sprint to Election Day\nIn-person voting for this year\u2019s presidential election began Friday (September 20, 2024), a milestone that kicked off a six-week sprint to Election Day after a summer of political turmoil.\n\nVoters lined up to cast their ballots in Minnesota, South Dakota and Virginia, the states with the first early in-person voting opportunities. About a dozen more states will follow by mid-October.\n\nAlso read: The battleground States that could decide the U.S. Presidential elections | Data\n\nAt a polling site in Minneapolis, Jason Miller arrived well before the polls opened at 8 a.m. and was first in line. He was among roughly 75 people who cast ballots in the first hour at the city's early voting center.\n\n\u201cWhy not try to be first? That\u2019s kind of fun, right?\u201d said the 37-year-old house painter.\n\nHe said he voted \u201cagainst crazy,\u201d but didn\u2019t want to name his choice for president.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I have to. I think that\u2019s pretty obvious. I think that\u2019s very, very clear,\" he said.\n\nThe beginning of in-person balloting follows a tumultuous summer in American politics that included President Joe Biden dropping out of the race and being replaced by Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee, and an assassination attempt against Republican nominee Donald Trump followed by another apparent attempt on his life just nine weeks later.\n\nAcross the country, local election directors are beefing up their security to keep their workers and polling places safe while also ensuring that ballots and voting procedures won\u2019t be tampered with. Officials and ordinary poll workers have been targets of harassment and even death threats since the 2020 presidential election.\n\nFederal authorities are investigating the origin of suspicious packages that have been sent to or received by elections officials in more than 15 states in recent days, including Virginia.\n\n\u201cIf I could wave a magic wand in this room right now, I would wish for two things: Between now and November 5th, I want to see high turnout and low drama,\u201d Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon said during a news conference Thursday that previewed his state\u2019s efforts around the election season. Simon also serves as president of the National Association of Secretaries of State.\n\nSome voters suggested that the potential for trouble or chaos on Election Day was one reason not to wait.\n\nChris Burda, 74, said she is encouraging others to get their ballots in early \u201cto avoid potential disruption on Election Day or in-person voting by a certain party who seems to be interested in poll watching to the point of intimidation.\u201d She cast her ballot for Harris at a Minneapolis voting center, saying the vice president was \u201cstanding up for democracy and the freedom to choose.\u201d\n\nAs the start of early voting approached, Trump's rhetoric turned more ominous with a pledge to prosecute anyone who \u201ccheats\u201d in the election in the same way he falsely claimed they did in 2020, when he lied about widespread fraud and attacked officials who stood by their accurate vote tallies.\n\nTrump has previously sought to sow doubts about mail voting and encouraged voters to cast ballots in person on Election Day. But this year, Trump and the Republican National Committee, which he now controls, have begun to embrace early and mail voting as a way to lock in GOP votes before Election Day, just as Democrats have done for years.\n\nEugene Otteson, 71, a Vietnam War veteran and former mill worker, cast his early ballot for the former president in Anoka, Minnesota. He said he believes Trump will keep the country from intervening in foreign conflicts and will manage the economy like a business executive.\n\n\u201cNot that I like him, but he\u2019s a business person, and I like someone who can run a business,\u201d Otteson said. \u201cWith Kamala, you still don\u2019t know what she stands for \u2026 I hear her going around say \u2018joy, joy.\u2019 Well, I can say joy to the world, but that don\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to stop the wars going on.\u201d\n\nIn Virginia, early in-person voting has long been popular in many parts of the state.\n\nFairfax County Elections Director Eric Spicer said roughly a third of local voters came to the polls on Election Day during the 2020 presidential election, while the rest voted by mail or early and in-person. Mary Lynn Pinkerman, the elections director for the city of Chesapeake, expects early voting to help ease the crowds on Nov. 5 but also cautioned that with heavy interest in this year's presidential race, \u201cvoters could still encounter wait times\u201d on Election Day.\n\nAmong Virginians taking advantage of early voting Friday was Rocklyn Faher, a retired U.S. Navy aviation electrician who served in the first Gulf War. He became emotional when talking about casting his ballot in Norfolk for Harris. Fighting back tears, he spoke about preserving the Constitution and the future for his grandchildren.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m obviously very emotionally invested in this election,\u201d said Faher, 70. \u201cIt is the most important election of the last 100 years.\u201d\n\nFaher said he believes in protecting reproductive rights and likes Harris' plan to provide $25,000 for first-time homebuyers, while criticizing Trump\u2019s plan to impose tariffs on products from overseas.\n\nHe also said that Harris\u2019 overall proposals are \u201cbetter than herding 10 million naturalized and unnatural immigrants, documented or undocumented, into railroad cars and shipping them across the border into Mexico. That\u2019s insane.\u201d\n\nImmigration, and in particular the surge at the country's southern border over the past few years, also is animating those casting a ballot for Trump, who has promised mass deportations if he wins the presidency again.\n\nIsrael Chavez, 37, came to America from Peru as a 10-year-old with his father and sister. He voted for Trump because he believes the economy was stronger under the former president and he supports a harder line on immigration.\n\n\u201cI know how it is when you have an open border and let anyone in,\u201d he said after casting his ballot at a voting center in Anoka, Minnesota. \u201cMy dad brought us into the country legally. We had visas. He just did it right.\"\n\nIn Yankton, South Dakota, the county elections office saw a steady stream of people voting early immediately after it opened at 9 a.m., said Kasi Foss, the county\u2019s assistant auditor. That\u2019s unusual for the first day of early voting.\n\nShe said that while the office didn\u2019t have a line for voting, the office consistently had two or three people wanting to vote at all times.\n\nSouth Dakota voters are deciding the fate of several ballot initiatives on hot-button issues, including a proposed amendment to the state constitution to protect abortion rights and a measure that would legalize the recreational use of marijuana. But Foss said she believes the presidential race is driving turnout.\n\n\u201cNormally, on the first day, we\u2019ll have a couple of stragglers,\u201d she said.\n\nSome voters might opt for early in-person balloting instead of using mail ballots to ensure their votes get counted, given the ongoing struggles of the U.S. Postal Service.\n\nState and local election officials from across the country last week warned that problems with mail deliveries threaten to disenfranchise voters, and they told the head of the system that it hasn\u2019t fixed persistent deficiencies despite their repeated attempts at outreach.\n\nPostmaster General Louis DeJoy responded in a letter released Monday that he\u2019ll work with state election officials to address their concerns, but reiterated that the Postal Service will be ready.\n\nSimon, the Minnesota secretary of state, urged voters to make their voting plans now.\n\n\u201cMy hope and expectation is that the USPS will do the things that we have recommended, and do them quickly over the next 47 days because the stakes really are high for individual voters,\u201d Simon said.",

        "text": "7 facts about Germany\u2019s AfD party\nAfD Saxony-Anhalt delegates hold up voting cards at a state party conference in Magdeburg, Germany, on Aug. 7, 2024. (Klaus-Dietmar Gabbert/dpa Picture-Alliance via Getty Images)\n\nEarlier this month, Alternative for Germany (AfD) became the first far-right political party to win a state election in Germany since World War II. With additional state elections coming up on Sept. 22 and federal elections about a year away, here are some key facts about AfD and its supporters, based primarily on a Pew Research Center survey of 1,008 German adults conducted Jan. 11-March 20, 2024.\n\nHow we did this This Pew Research Center analysis highlights key findings about Germany\u2019s Alternative for Germany party (AfD) following recent state elections. The analysis draws on a nationally representative survey of 1,008 German adults conducted from Jan. 11 to March 20, 2024. The survey was conducted over the phone.\n\nThroughout the analysis, we analyze respondents\u2019 attitudes based on their favorability of AfD. We categorize respondents as being \u201cAfD supporters\u201d if they have a very or somewhat favorable view of the party, while \u201cnonsupporters\u201d are those who have very or somewhat unfavorable views of AfD. Those who did not answer the question are excluded from the analysis.\n\nTo compare educational groups, we standardize education levels based on the UN\u2019s International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED).\n\nPrior to 2024, combined totals were based on rounded topline figures. For all reports beginning in 2024, totals are based on unrounded topline figures, so combined totals might be different than in previous years. Refer to the 2024 topline to see our new rounding procedures applied to past years\u2019 data.\n\nHere are the questions used for the analysis, along with responses, and the survey methodology.\n\nAround one-in-five Germans (19%) see AfD favorably, but a large majority (79%) have a negative opinion of the party. Germans with lower levels of education are 10 percentage points more likely than those with higher levels of education to express a positive opinion of the party (22% vs. 12%). Men also have more positive views of AfD than women do (26% vs. 11%), and the share of men holding this opinion has risen 10 points since 2022.\n\nAfD has become more popular in recent years. Today, 19% of German adults have a positive view of the party. This is the highest favorability we\u2019ve recorded in eight years of surveys on the topic. The party\u2019s favorability is up significantly from 14% in 2021, though largely unchanged from the 17% measured last year.\n\nOther German political parties have generally become less popular in recent years. Chancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s Social Democratic Party (SPD), for example, was seen positively by most in the months after he took office, but the share of Germans with a positive view of SPD has fallen sharply since then, from 67% in 2022 to 39% this year.\n\nAfD supporters, like other far-right populists in\n\nEurope, tend to have more positive views of former U.S. President Donald Trump. As the United States\u2019 presidential election approaches, few Germans overall have confidence in Trump to do the right thing regarding world affairs. But AfD supporters in Germany are much more likely than nonsupporters to express confidence in him (39% vs. 9%).\n\nAfD supporters also have significantly less confidence in U.S. President Joe Biden than nonsupporters do. Around four-in-ten AfD supporters (38%) have confidence in the current president, compared with 71% of nonsupporters. (The survey was fielded before Biden was replaced by Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee in the upcoming election.)\n\nDuring the Trump administration, AfD supporters had more favorable views of the U.S. than Germans who did not support the party. For example, in 2019, 54% of Germans with a favorable view of AfD also had a favorable view of the U.S., compared with 36% of those who have an unfavorable view of the party.\n\nSince Biden\u2019s election in 2020, though, the two groups have expressed similar levels of favorability toward the U.S. Today, 46% of AfD supporters and 50% of nonsupporters see the U.S. favorably.\n\nAfD supporters are much more pessimistic about Germany\u2019s economy than nonsupporters are. Only 19% of Germans with a favorable view of the party think their country\u2019s economy is in good shape. Among Germans who have an unfavorable view of AfD, 45% think the country\u2019s economic situation is good.\n\nThese pessimistic views of the economy among AfD supporters mark a break from the not-too-distant past. In fall 2020, 73% of AfD supporters thought the German economy was in good shape.\n\nSatisfaction with German democracy is lower among AfD supporters than among nonsupporters. Only 20% of Germans with a favorable view of the party say democracy in their country is working well. Among Germans with an unfavorable view of the party, 65% believe their democracy is working well.\n\n\n\nAgain, views among AfD supporters have soured in recent years. In fall 2020, 51% of those with favorable views of the party thought German democracy was working well.\n\nGermans with a favorable view of AfD are far less likely than nonsupporters to see the European Union favorably. Only 30% of AfD supporters have a positive view of the EU, compared with 72% of those who do not support the party.\n\nAmong AfD supporters, views of the EU have fluctuated somewhat over time, reaching a high of 53% favorable in 2022. But this share has fallen by 23 points since then, including a 16-point drop in the last year.\n\nAfD supporters see key figures in the Russia-Ukraine war very differently than other Germans do. For example, AfD supporters have more confidence in Russian President Vladimir Putin than those who do not support the party (45% vs. 10%). Nonsupporters, by comparison, have much more positive views of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (61% vs. 31%). AfD has campaigned against weapon deliveries to Ukraine and called for an end to sanctions on Russia.\n\nAfD supporters also stand out for having significantly less favorable views than nonsupporters when it comes to NATO (39% vs. 71%).\n\nRelated: NATO Seen Favorably in Member States; Confidence in Zelenskyy Down in Europe, U.S.\n\nNote: Here are the questions used for the analysis, along with responses, and the survey methodology.",

        "text": "Historian who predicted 9 of 10 elections makes pick in 2024 presidential race\nThe 2024 presidential election is shaping up to be one of the most divisive in American history, with battleground states expected to play a pivotal role in determining the outcome.\n\nAllan Lichtman, a historian renowned for his accurate predictions in nine of the last 10 presidential elections, has made his forecast for the upcoming race. Lichtman believes Vice President Kamala Harris will claim the presidency in November.\n\nHowever, his prediction hinges on critical swing states, including Arizona, where 11 electoral votes are up for grabs.\n\nWho is Allan Lichtman and what does he base his predictions on?\n\nLichtman, a distinguished professor of history at American University in Washington, D.C., earned his doctorate from Harvard and specializes in modern American history and quantitative methods. He has published his \"Keys to the White House\" model since 1984, basing his predictions on 13 true-or-false indicators. These \u201ckeys\u201d assess the performance and strength of the incumbent White House party.\n\nThe keys include whether:\n\nThe White House party gained House seats during the midterm elections.\n\nThe sitting president is running for reelection.\n\nThe White House party is avoiding a primary contest.\n\nThere is a third-party challenger.\n\nThe short-term economy is strong.\n\nThe long-term economic growth has been as good as the last two terms.\n\nThe White House party has made major changes to national policy.\n\nThere is sustained social unrest during the term.\n\nThe White House is untainted by scandal; the incumbent party is charismatic.\n\nThe challenger is uncharismatic.\n\nThe incumbent is charismatic.\n\nThe White House party has a major failure in foreign policy.\n\nThe White House party has foreign policy success.\n\nWho will win in New Jersey in the presidential election?\n\nNew Jersey has backed the Democratic candidate in every presidential election since 1992, with margins consistently in double digits since 2008. In 2020, the state supported Democrat Joe Biden of Delaware by a 57% to 41% margin.\n\nAccording to a prediction by The Hill, New Jersey is comfortably going to go blue again.\n\nWhen is the vice presidential debate between Tim Walz and JD Vance?\n\nJD Vance and Tim Walz will debate on Oct. 1, hosted by CBS News.",

        "text": "Janet Jackson tells interviewer she's heard Kamala Harris is not Black, echoing election disinformation\nEchoing well-trodden disinformation that has infected the U.S. presidential election, pop icon Janet Jackson said she has heard Vice President Kamala Harris is not Black.\n\nThe remarks were published Saturday by The Guardian, granted access and interview time as Jackson promotes her latest tour\u2019s European stops. Jackson is also promoting a residency that starts in December at Resorts World Las Vegas.\n\nJackson\u2019s representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment Saturday evening.\n\nBecause Jackson sang of wanting to \u201cbreak the color lines\u201d on the 1989 single \u201cRhythm Nation,\u201d the interviewer said she was inspired to ask for Jackson\u2019s view of Harris as a Black woman who could be the first to serve as U.S. president.\n\n\u201cWell, you know what they supposedly said?\u201d Jackson is quoted as saying during the interview in her adopted hometown of London. \u201cShe\u2019s not Black. That\u2019s what I heard. That she\u2019s Indian.\u201d\n\nThe author wrote that she responded with a correction, telling Jackson that Harris does have Indian heritage but is also Black.\n\n\u201c[Harris\u2019] father\u2019s white,\u201d Jackson is quoted as saying. \u201cThat\u2019s what I was told. I mean, I haven\u2019t watched the news in a few days. I was told that they discovered her father was white.\u201d\n\nThe vice president\u2019s campaign did not immediately respond Saturday night to a request for comment on Jackson\u2019s remarks.\n\nIn July, former President Donald Trump, who is running against Harris in a battle to succeed President Joe Biden, said the vice president \u201cturned Black\u201d for political gain after previously \u201conly promoting Indian heritage.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know she was Black until a number of years ago, when she happened to turn Black,\u201d Trump said at the National Association of Black Journalists\u2019 2024 convention.\n\nThe same evening, Harris painted Trump\u2019s remarks on her background as part of a strategy to turn Americans against each other for his benefit.\n\n\u201cIt was the same old show \u2014 the divisiveness and the disrespect,\u201d Harris said at an event in Houston. \u201cAnd let me just say, the American people deserve better.\u201d\n\nHarris\u2019 mother, Shyamala Gopalan, was born in southern India. Father Donald J. Harris, an economist and Stanford University professor emeritus, was born in Jamaica and is Black.\n\nDuring the interview with The Guardian, Jackson also expressed a lack of hope regarding the presidential election.\n\n\u201cI think either way it goes is going to be mayhem,\u201d Jackson is quoted as saying.\n\nThe singer also touched on the topic of child sex trafficking while responding to a question about the \u201cRhythm Nation\u201d album, which she said was about \u201cmaking a difference in a kid\u2019s life, a teenager\u2019s life.\u201d\n\n\"There\u2019s all this child trafficking crap that\u2019s going on and sex trafficking crap, you know what I mean, that wasn\u2019t so prevalent then?\u201d she said, adding that sex trafficking is \"really now out in the open, because it\u2019s like a billion-dollar business and all that crap.\u201d\n\nThe star survived an allegedly abusive father, Joe Jackson, who died in 2018. Brother Michael Jackson accused him of physical abuse, and sister La Toya once claimed he sexually abused her, though she later recanted.\n\nJackson is promoting tour dates, but she also may be embarking on a campaign to strengthen a legacy that may have been tarnished in the shadow of Michael Jackson\u2019s pop kingship and shunned after Justin Timberlake exposed her nipple during the Super Bowl halftime show in 2004, The Guardian reported.\n\nAs it stands, she has amassed 10 No. 1 hits, 5 Grammy Awards and an Academy Award nomination for best original song.",

        "text": "Harris campaign, Jewish groups fiercely criticize Trump preemptively blaming Jewish voters if he loses\n\"Donald Trump is resorting to the oldest antisemitic tropes,\" her campaign said.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris' campaign and Jewish advocacy groups on Friday forcefully criticized what they called former President Donald Trump's \"dangerous\" and \"antisemitic\" comments saying Jewish voters would be to blame if he lost the presidential election.\n\n\"I'll put it to you very simply and as gently as I can: I wasn't treated properly by the voters who happen to be Jewish,\" Trump said at an event Thursday night in Washington that was meant to highlight antisemitism. \"I don't know. Do they know what the hell is happening if I don't win this election? And the Jewish people would really have a lot to do with that if that happens, because at 40% that means 60% of the people are voting for the enemy.\"\n\nThe backlash was fierce.\n\n\"Donald Trump is resorting to the oldest antisemitic tropes in the book because he's weak and can't stand the fact that the majority of America is going to reject him in November. But we know that words like these can have dangerous consequences,\" Harris campaign national security spokesperson Morgan Finkelstein said in a statement. \"As Trump has proven, including over the past few weeks with his lies about Springfield, Ohio, he will cling to fearmongering and intimidation, no matter the cost.\"\n\nRepublican presidential nominee, former U.S. President Donald Trump, speaks before prominent Jewish donors at an event titled \"Fighting Anti-Semitism in America\" at the Hyatt Regency Capitol Hill on September 19, 2024, in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nTrump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, have in recent days pushed the baseless claim that Haitian migrants in Springfield, most of whom are legally there, of stealing and eating neighbors' pets -- an accusation roundly refuted by local officials.\n\n\"When Donald Trump loses this election, it will be because Americans from all faiths, ethnicities, and backgrounds came together to turn the page on the divisiveness he demonstrates every day,\" Finkelstein added.\n\nHarris' husband, second gentleman Doug Emhoff, who is Jewish himself, wrote on X Friday that Jewish Americans would not be \"intimidated\" by Trump's attacks. \"Last night, Donald Trump once again fanned the flames of antisemitism by trafficking in tropes blaming and scapegoating Jews. He even did it at an event purporting to fight antisemitism, no less,\" Emhoff wrote. \"This is dangerous and must be condemned. We will not be intimidated and will continue to live openly, proudly, and without fear as Jews.\"\n\nNon-partisan Jewish advocacy organizations also vocalized their strong opposition to Trump's comment.\n\n\"Whoever a majority of the Jewish community votes for, Jews -- roughly 2 percent of the U.S. population -- cannot and should not be blamed for the outcome of the election,\" the American Jewish Committee wrote in a statement. \"Setting up anyone to say, 'we lost because of the Jews' is outrageous and dangerous. Thousands of years of history have shown that scapegoating Jews can lead to antisemitic hate and violence.\"\n\nSome Jewish voters will vote for Harris, and some will vote for Trump, the AJC said, adding that \"None of us, by supporting the candidate we choose, is 'voting for the enemy.'\"\n\nDemocratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris arrives to speak at the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute (CHCI) leadership conference, Sept. 18, 2024, in Washington. Jacquelyn Martin/AP\n\nAnti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblat wrote on social media that Trump's comments contradicted the message of the antisemitic event at which he was speaking and can make it worse for Jewish Americans.\n\n\"Preemptively blaming American Jews for your potential election loss does zero to help American Jews. It increases their sense of alienation in a moment of vulnerability when right-wing extremists and left-wing antizionists continually demonize and slander Jews,\" Greenblat wrote \"Let's be clear, this speech likely will spark more hostility and further inflame an already bad situation.\"\n\nAmy Spitalnick, who leads the progressive-leaning Jewish Council for Public Affairs, encouraged more people to join growing chorus slamming Trump's comment.\n\n\"Last night, Trump preemptively blamed the Jews for his possible electoral loss, after spending months calling Jews who don't support him 'crazy' & 'disloyal.' Speaking out against this isn't about partisan politics -- it's about fundamental Jewish safety,\" Spitalnick wrote. \"We need everyone to do so.\"\n\nTrump did receive backing from some on the political right. The Republican Jewish Coalition, a major Jewish political group that has endorsed Trump, praised Trump for his remarks on combatting antisemitism.\n\nMatt Brooks, the CEO of the organization, told ABC News in a phone interview that he thought the comments about Jewish voters and the election were about motivating Jewish voters, and that Democratic claims otherwise are a deflection.\n\n\"I think what it was is the president trying to motivate the Jewish community,\" Brooks said, adding that Trump \"realizes what's at stake\" for American Jews, who feel unsafe in America due to a rise in antisemitism. (Brooks pointed to intimidation faced by Jewish students on college campuses as one example.)\n\n\"This is an absolute distraction, to deflect that [Trump] made many significant and important contributions to the Jewish community,\" Brooks said.\n\nHe added that Trump was also indicating how close of an election it may be in battleground states, where given the likely slim margin, \"if the Jewish vote doesn't move in his favor, it may cost him the election.\"",

        "text": "Arizona high court rules nearly 98,000 people whose citizenship hadn\u2019t been confirmed can vote the full ballot\nPHOENIX (AP) \u2014 The Arizona Supreme Court unanimously ruled Friday that nearly 98,000 people whose citizenship documents hadn\u2019t been confirmed can vote in state and local races, a significant decision that could influence ballot measures and tight legislative races.\n\nThe court\u2019s decision comes after officials uncovered a database error that for two decades mistakenly designated the voters as having access to the full ballot. The voters already were entitled to cast ballots in federal races, including for president and Congress, regardless of how the court ruled.\n\nREAD MORE: Supreme Court rejects Republican effort to block over 40,000 Arizona voters, but partly approves proof of citizenship law\n\nSecretary of State Adrian Fontes, a Democrat, and Stephen Richer, the Republican Maricopa County recorder, had disagreed on what status the voters should hold. Richer asked the high court to weigh in, saying Fontes ignored state law by advising county officials to let affected voters cast full ballots.\n\nFontes said not allowing the voters who believed they had satisfied voting requirements access to the full ballot would raise equal protection and due process concerns.\n\nThe high court, which leans Republican, agreed with Fontes. It said county officials lack the authority to change the voters\u2019 statuses because those voters registered long ago and had attested under the penalty of law that they are citizens. The justices also said the voters were not at fault for the database error and also mentioned the little time that\u2019s left before the Nov. 5 general election.\n\n\u201cWe are unwilling on these facts to disenfranchise voters en masse from participating in state contests,\u201d Chief Justice Ann Scott Timmer wrote in the ruling.\n\nOf the nearly 98,000 affected voters, most of them reside in Maricopa County, which is home to Phoenix, and are longtime state residents who range in age from 45 to 60. About 37 percent of them are registered Republicans, about 27 percent are registered Democrats and the rest are independents or affiliated with minor parties.\n\nArizona is unique among states in that it requires voters to prove their citizenship to participate in local and state races. Voters can demonstrate citizenship by providing a driver\u2019s license or tribal ID number, or they can attach a copy of a birth certificate, passport or naturalization documents.\n\nArizona considers drivers\u2019 licenses issued after October 1996 to be valid proof of citizenship. However, a system coding error marked nearly 98,000 voters who obtained licenses before 1996 \u2014 roughly 2.5 percent of all registered voters \u2014 as full-ballot voters, state officials said.\n\nThe error between the state\u2019s voter registration database and the Motor Vehicle Division has since been resolved.\n\nThat number of votes could tip the scales in hotly contested races for the state Legislature, where Republicans hold a slim majority in both chambers.\n\nVoters also are deciding on the constitutional right to abortion and on a state law that would criminalize noncitizens for entering Arizona through Mexico at any location other than a port of entry.\n\nThough Richer and Fontes disagreed over the status of the voters, both celebrated the court\u2019s ruling.\n\n\u201cThank God,\u201d Richer said on the social platform X. He told The Associated Press on Thursday that maintaining voters\u2019 statuses would be administratively easier.\n\nFontes, in a news release, called the ruling a \u201csignificant victory for those whose fundamental right to vote was under scrutiny.\u201d Election officials will be contacting voters who need to update their proof of citizenship after the election, he said.\n\nJohn Groseclose, who was among the voters whose citizenship was in question, said he was relieved he wouldn\u2019t have to spend more time running around to resolve the mix-up.\n\nEarlier this week, he said he waited an hour and a half at a motor vehicle office in Tempe only to find that the employee who attended to him was unaware of the issue and did not know how to update his voter registration \u2014 despite him providing an official birth certificate and new passport.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad that none of us are going to be disenfranchised over an error generated by the MVD 20 some-odd years ago,\u201d Groseclose told the AP.",

        "text": "Poll: Newly popular Harris builds momentum, challenging Trump for the mantle of change\nA double-digit increase in popularity, rising Democratic enthusiasm and an early edge for representing \u201cchange\u201d have vaulted Vice President Kamala Harris forward and reshuffled the 2024 presidential contest, according to a new national NBC News poll.\n\nWith just over six weeks until Election Day, the poll finds Harris with a 5-point lead over former President Donald Trump among registered voters, 49% to 44%. While that result is within the margin of error, it\u2019s a clear shift from July\u2019s poll, when Trump was ahead by 2 points before President Joe Biden\u2019s exit.\n\nBut the transformation in the presidential contest goes well beyond the horse race. For starters, Harris\u2019 favorability has jumped 16 points since July, the largest increase for any politician in NBC News polling since then-President George W. Bush\u2019s standing surged after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.Harris also holds the advantage over Trump on being seen as competent and effective, as well as on having the mental and physical health to be president \u2014 a reversal from Trump\u2019s leads on those qualities when he was matched up against Biden.\n\nAnd in a contest between a sitting vice president and an ex-president, featuring an electorate that overwhelmingly thinks the U.S. is \u201con the wrong track,\u201d Harris has the upper hand on which candidate better represents change and which candidate can get the country headed in the right direction.\n\n\u201cIn July, there was a stiff breeze heading directly at President Biden and obscuring a clear path to victory. Today, the winds have turned in Kamala Harris\u2019 favor,\u201d said Jeff Horwitt of Hart Research Associates, the Democratic pollster who conducted this survey with Republican pollster Bill McInturff of Public Opinion Strategies.\n\nStill, Trump holds important advantages on the economy and inflation, although those leads are smaller than they were when Biden was still in the contest. Two-thirds of voters say their family income is falling behind the cost of living, and voters ranked the cost of living as their top concern in the election.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the poll shows that some of Trump\u2019s erosion has come from Republicans who aren\u2019t die-hard supporters of the former president \u2014 but who could come back home to him, like they did in 2016 and 2020.\n\n\u201cWe have seen this movie before,\u201d said McInturff. \u201cThey can get squishy on Trump, and then in the end they come back and they vote the way they\u2019re going to vote on a Republican-versus-Democrat preference for Congress.\u201d\n\nOverall, the 2024 presidential race looks a lot like it did four years ago, both pollsters agree, with the Democratic nominee more popular than the Republican candidate, the electorate still deeply polarized, and the final result unclear.\n\n\u201cAll of this movement to Harris essentially returns the race to where it was in 2020 at the end of the campaign: a very close election,\u201d Horwitt said.\n\nThis brand-new NBC News poll, conducted Sept. 13-17, comes after a momentous two months in American politics, including Biden\u2019s withdrawal from the 2024 race on July 21, two party conventions, two vice-presidential selections, an assassination attempt on Trump in July and another apparent attempt two months later, and the first (and perhaps only) debate between Trump and Harris.In the first NBC News poll since those events, Harris gets support from 49% of registered voters in the head-to-head test against Trump, who gets 44%. Another 7% either pick another candidate, say they\u2019re unsure or say they won\u2019t vote.\n\nIn an expanded ballot with third-party candidates, Harris leads Trump by 6 points, 47% to 41% \u2014 with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. at 2%, Jill Stein at 2% and Libertarian Chase Oliver at 1%. (Respondents were only able to pick from the major third-party candidates who will actually appear on the ballot in their states.)\n\nBoth ways of testing the race represent a change from July\u2019s poll, when Trump was narrowly ahead of Biden by 2 points on the head-to-head ballot test and by 3 points on the expanded ballot test. The September results are the Democratic ticket\u2019s best performance in the poll since the summer of 2023.\n\nIn the current head-to-head matchup, Harris holds the advantage among Black voters (85%-7%), voters ages 18-34 (57%-34%), women (58%-37%), white voters with college degrees (59%-38%) and independents (43%-35%).\n\nAll of these advantages are larger for Harris than Biden had enjoyed when he was still in the race, except among independents, where Harris\u2019 8-point edge is almost identical to Biden\u2019s advantage in July.\n\n(RELATED: See here for more on how the race has changed since Biden\u2019s exit.)\n\nTrump, meanwhile, is ahead among men (52%-40%), white voters (52%-43%) and white voters without college degrees (61%-33%).\n\nSeventy-one percent of all voters say their minds are made up, while 11% say they might change their vote \u2014 a shift from April, when 26% said they could still change their mind.\n\nHarris leads on abortion, fitness and change; Trump is ahead on the key issues of the border and inflation\n\nThe NBC News poll also tests Harris and Trump on 13 different issues and presidential qualities.\n\nHarris\u2019 best results are on protecting immigrant rights (where she has a 28-point lead over Trump), abortion (+21 points), having the necessary mental and physical health to be president (+20 points), having the right temperament to be president (+16 points) and representing change (+9 points).\n\nBy comparison, Trump\u2019s biggest leads are on securing the border (+21), the economy (+9) and dealing with the cost of living (+8).\n\nThose current Trump advantages, however, are all down from when Biden was still in the race. When NBC News put those questions to voters about Trump and Biden in January, Trump led the president by 35 points on the issue of securing the border and controlling immigration and by 22 points on dealing with the economy.In April, voters gave Trump a 22-point edge over Biden on dealing with inflation and the cost of living, too.\n\nA historic jump in Harris' popularity\n\nBeyond those issues and qualities, what also stands out in the poll is Harris\u2019 increased popularity since her elevation to the top of the Democratic ticket.\n\nIn July, 32% of registered voters had a positive view of Harris, versus 50% who saw her in a negative light (-18 net rating) \u2014 almost identical to Biden\u2019s rating.\n\nBut in this new poll, Harris is now at 48% positive, 45% negative (+3).\n\nNo major-party presidential candidate in the 35-year history of the NBC News poll has seen this kind of jump in popularity in an election.\n\nAnd the only increases that are greater than Harris\u2019 in successive NBC News polls are George W. Bush\u2019s leap after 9/11 (when his positive number increased nearly 30 points); then-President George H.W. Bush\u2019s jump in popularity after the first Gulf War (when his positive number increased by 24 points); and independent Ross Perot, who got a 23-point jump when he re-entered the 1992 presidential race after previously dropping out.By contrast, Trump\u2019s net rating in the new poll is essentially unchanged from July \u2014 40% positive, 53% negative (-13).\n\nDespite that improvement for Harris, the poll contains warning signs for Democrats. For one thing, inflation and the cost of living remain voters\u2019 top issue. And 66% of voters say their family\u2019s income is falling behind the cost of living.\n\nIn addition, while Harris leads Trump on \u201cchange,\u201d a separate question shows a potential vulnerability in being tied to Biden\u2019s presidency: 40% of voters say they\u2019re more concerned that Harris will continue the same approach as Biden.\n\nThat\u2019s compared with 39% who are more concerned that Trump will continue the same approach as his first term as president; 18% say neither is a concern.\n\nMeanwhile, 65% of voters say the country is on the wrong track, compared to just 28% who say it\u2019s heading in the right direction. Though the wrong-track percentage is smaller than it\u2019s been during most of the Biden-Harris administration, the sour outlook closely mirrors how voters saw things when they decided to change the party in the White House in 2016 and 2020.\n\nAnd while the share of Democrats expressing high interest in the election \u2014 registering either a \u201c9\u201d or \u201c10\u201d on a 10-point scale \u2014 has increased since July, young voters remain at a low level of interest compared to recent presidential elections.\n\nOther poll findings\n\nOn the recent debate between Harris and Trump, 29% said the Sept. 10 showdown made them more likely to support Harris, versus 12% who said it made them more likely to back Trump; 57% said it made no difference.\n\nIn the battle for control of Congress, 48% of registered voters prefer a Democratic-controlled Congress, compared with 46% who want Republicans in charge. (That\u2019s essentially unchanged from July, when it was 47% Democratic, 46% Republican.)\n\nAnd on Project 2025 \u2014 the conservative policy blueprint with ties to former Trump administration officials, which Democrats have featured in their campaign \u2014 a whopping 57% of voters have a negative view of it, versus just 4% who see it in a positive light.\n\nThe national NBC News poll was conducted Sept. 13-17 of 1,000 registered voters \u2014 870 of whom were reached via cellphone \u2014 and it has an overall margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.",

        "text": "Is Donald Trump a fascist?\nIs Donald Trump really a fascist? It\u2019s a question that has been bubbling away since he first announced his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination in 2015 after a years-long campaign to brand Barack Obama an illegitimate occupant of the White House. Back then his questioning of Obama\u2019s citizenship appeared overtly racist (\u201cWhen I was 18, people called me Donald Trump. When he was 18 @BarackObama was Barry Soweto\u201d). So were his comments about Mexican immigrants at his campaign launch: \u201cThey\u2019re bringing crime. They\u2019re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.\u201d Trump\u2019s early indications that he would not accept the results of any election he did not win made him sound like an anti-democrat. And he told Hillary Clinton in their first presidential debate that if he became president, she would end up in jail, which is where he seemed to think his political opponents belonged. It was plenty. But was it fascism?\n\nBefore 2016, the closest the US had ever come to electing a fascist as president was in a work of fiction. Philip Roth\u2019s The Plot Against America, published in 2004, imagines an alternative history for the country in which Charles Lindbergh \u2013 real-life aviation hero and Nazi sympathiser \u2013 has defeated Franklin Roosevelt in the 1940 presidential election on a promise to keep the US out of the second world war. In Roth\u2019s telling, Lindbergh then initiates non-aggression pacts with Hitler\u2019s Germany and Imperial Japan before embarking on a domestic programme of forced Jewish assimilation. Only when the popular radio host Walter Winchell announces he will stand against Lindbergh for the presidency and is shot dead at a campaign rally does the country come to its senses and drive Lindbergh out.\n\nRoth died in 2018, aged 85, so he lived long enough to see Trump\u2019s arrival in the White House. Towards the end of his life, Roth was asked whether he had intended his novel as a warning about the possibility of fascism in 21st-century America, and whether that warning had gone unheeded. No, was his answer. He hadn\u2019t been thinking of a politician like Trump, though he knew his type well and his fiction is full of such characters: braggarts, charlatans, conmen, narcissistic whiners, sexually incontinent bullies. These men are everywhere in US business and haunt many US families. Something Roth hadn\u2019t imagined \u2013 not even in his wildest fantasies \u2013 was that such a person might become president.\n\nWhat Roth didn\u2019t live to see is how Trump conducted himself after he lost the presidency. On 6 January 2021, two weeks before he was due to leave office, Trump encouraged his supporters to march on the Capitol in a bid to prevent the congressional ratification of his election defeat. Though Trump claims he was not responsible for what happened next, the riot that followed \u2013 with his supporters storming government buildings and elected officials fleeing for their lives \u2013 echoed some of the darkest chapters of modern European history. This is how fascists behave when democracy stops working for them. It was monstrous. But it was also ridiculous. The mob seemed clueless what to do once they had breached the Capitol\u2019s defences. They were dressed for a day trip, not an insurrection. Some \u2013 most notoriously the \u201cQAnon shaman\u201d in his horned raccoon headgear and patriotic face paint \u2013 looked as though they were headed for a kids\u2019 fancy-dress party. If this was fascism, it was also a farce.\n\nThe question of whether a conman can also be a fascist \u2013 or a fascist also a conman \u2013 has become more pressing after Trump came within inches of becoming a martyr for the cause. On 13 July Thomas Matthew Crooks attempted to assassinate Trump at a campaign rally near Butler, Pennsylvania, grazing the candidate\u2019s ear with one shot and killing a member of the crowd with another. A few weeks earlier, the New Republic \u2013 a left-leaning magazine \u2013 had published a special issue devoted to the threat posed by Trump\u2019s potential return to the White House. Its cover pictured him with a Hitler comb-over and toothbrush moustache (based on a 1932 Nazi campaign poster), with the tagline \u201cAmerican Fascism: What Would It Look Like\u201d. The image went viral.\n\nView image in fullscreen Trump after the assassination attempt in July. Photograph: Evan Vucci/AP\n\nPlenty of Trump\u2019s supporters were quick to link the two events. Chip Roy, a Republican congressman from Texas, tweeted an image of the New Republic cover after the assassination attempt with the words, \u201cYou bastards.\u201d JD Vance, who had not yet been chosen as Trump\u2019s running mate, wrote, \u201cThe central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs. That rhetoric led directly to President Trump\u2019s attempted assassination.\u201d This despite the fact that in 2016 Vance had posted on Facebook, \u201cI go back and forth between thinking Trump might be a cynical asshole like Nixon who wouldn\u2019t be that bad (and might even prove useful) or that he might be America\u2019s Hitler.\u201d\n\nCynical asshole or fascist? Since 2016, Trump\u2019s behaviour has made the question more acute without settling it. Robert O Paxton, an authority on the historical definition of fascism, argued in 2017 that, despite many overlaps, Trump did not ultimately fit the bill: he was too much of a poser, too lacking in a coherent political programme and too much of a plutocrat. Hitler expropriated the wealthy; Trump sucks up to them. But after the events of 6 January 2021, Paxton changed his mind. In Newsweek a few days afterwards he wrote, \u201cTrump\u2019s incitement of the invasion of the Capitol \u2026 removes my objection to the fascist label. His open encouragement of civic violence to overturn an election crosses a red line.\u201d Trump\u2019s time in office, by implication, had not revealed him to be a fascist (he had, after all, failed to deliver on his promise to jail his main political rival, as he had failed to deliver on many of his promises). It was the manner of his refusal to leave office that had moved the dial.\n\nMichael Tomasky, editor of the New Republic, wrote in his introduction to the magazine\u2019s American fascism issue, \u201cWe at the New Republic think we can spend this election year in one of two ways. We can spend it debating whether Trump meets the nine or 17 points that define fascism. Or we can spend it saying, \u2018He\u2019s damn close enough, and we\u2019d better fight.\u2019\u201d The articles that followed laid out what life in the US under a second Trump term might be like. They imagined far greater repression of minorities, a violent clampdown on illegal immigration, co-option of the US military by Trump, infiltration of the US state by hardline ideologues, the hollowing out of democratic institutions and curtailment of civil liberties. It would certainly look a lot like fascism.\n\nWhat it would not look like is his first term, when his bark was far worse than his bite. His most significant achievement during his time in office was putting on the supreme court three conservative justices (Kavanaugh, Gorsuch, Barrett) who have since allowed the court to pursue an agenda that is highly congenial to their former sponsor. This has included granting Trump partial immunity for any criminal acts committed during his presidency. Yet it would be hard to paint this as fascism. Skewing the court their way is what all modern presidents have attempted to do when the chance has arisen, even if few got as many chances as Trump. He was ruthless but also lucky. Moreover, it was what he was elected to do. Many of his supporters in 2016 swallowed their doubts about his toxic personality to get a court that might overturn Roe v Wade. Whatever you think about the results, the means are not outside the normal bounds of US democracy.\n\nWhy, then, does the question of Trump\u2019s possible fascist leanings loom so much larger now? When The New Republic published its story, Joe Biden was still the candidate. After his disastrous debate performance, he seemed on the path to near certain defeat, and though his replacement by Kamala Harris has dissipated some of the dread of Trump\u2019s inevitable return to office, the race remains a toss-up, even after Trump\u2019s own debate meltdown last week. Now a second apparent assassination attempt at Trump\u2019s West Palm Beach golf club has made an unstable situation even more unstable. But what hasn\u2019t changed are the factors that make the prospect of Trump 2.0 far more frightening than his first foray into office.\n\nIf Trump doesn\u2019t like you, he will take you apart on his social media accounts. But he won\u2019t actually have you butchered\n\nThe events of 6 January seem to indicate a far greater willingness than previously seen to summon up violent opposition to democratic process and the rule of law. His rhetoric \u2013 lambasting the mainstream media, scorning the democratic process, promising a vote for him means not having to vote again (he told a Christian audience in Florida in late July, \u201cIn four years you don\u2019t have to vote again. We\u2019ll have it fixed so good you\u2019re not gonna have to vote\u201d) \u2013 is as incendiary as ever. But perhaps more significantly, many Trump acolytes have spent the Biden presidency coming up with far more coherent and ruthless programmes for government than those on offer first time around. Prime among these is Project 2025, an initiative produced by the Heritage Foundation, a leading Conservative thinktank once associated with Ronald Reagan, now fully on board with Trump\u2019s version of Republicanism. Among its proposals is a plan to take partisan control of government agencies in order to root out liberal policies, expand presidential powers, enforce an anti-abortion agenda, impose a sharp crackdown on illegal immigration, tear up net zero initiatives and abolish many federal agencies, including the Department of Education. In the words of one of its directors, Project 2025 is about \u201csystematically preparing to march into office \u2026 a new army of aligned, trained and weaponised conservatives ready to do battle against the deep state\u201d. Trump has hummed and hawed about whether he supports this agenda (he has described himself as knowing \u201cnothing\u201d about Project 2025 and his campaign manager called it \u201ca pain in the ass\u201d). But one of the points of Project 2025 is not to be so dependent on Trump\u2019s personal prevarications this time round.\n\nIn Paxton\u2019s 2004 book The Anatomy of Fascism, he identified a willingness to summon up the violence of the streets to intimidate and if necessary overpower established institutions as a defining characteristic. It is what distinguishes fascism from other kinds of authoritarianism. Illiberal authoritarians invariably want to control government institutions but they aim to do so from the inside by bending them to their will. They are wary of conjuring up an independent source of power in violent paramilitaries and other kinds of street politics. True fascists such as Mussolini and Hitler have no such compunction. Their political authority was built on establishing parallel party structures \u2013 from the Blackshirts to the SS \u2013 willing to bypass the institutions of the state whenever necessary and answerable to the leader personally. It is what marked them out from other dictators of the period. Stalin in the Soviet Union simply replaced state institutions with their Bolshevik equivalents, which monopolised all political coercion. Franco in Spain worked with existing state institutions \u2013 and the Catholic church \u2013 to keep a lid on political chaos. Hitler and Mussolini called up the chaos of untamed violence when it suited them.\n\nIn that respect, Project 2025 is not a fascist document. It has a lot more in common with the governing philosophy of illiberal authoritarians such as Victor Orb\u00e1n in Hungary, including in its strong embrace of traditional Christian values. Its approach is more consistent with the goal of getting sympathetic judges on the courts than a private militia into gear. The Heritage Foundation sees itself in the business of training an army of like-minded bureaucrats, not an actual street mob. What, though, of the violence of 6 January and Trump\u2019s part in it? Trump has never been shy of invoking violence against his enemies, real and perceived. During the Black Lives Matter protests in the summer of 2020, he tweeted, \u201cPlease just deploy the military and take control of these animals who are ruining our cities!\u201d He has said he is fine with the \u201croughing up\u201d of hecklers at his rallies. In 2016 he told his supporters at a campaign event, \u201cIf you see someone getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of them, would you? Seriously. OK? Just knock the hell. I promise you I will pay for the legal fees. I promise.\u201d\n\nBut this isn\u2019t fascism either. Trump\u2019s style is to lash out against anyone he gets affronted by and to express his personal grievances in the language of the mob. It\u2019s dangerous and it\u2019s demeaning. But it\u2019s not a political strategy. Trump has done almost nothing to organise his own shock troops. He simply asks whoever feels the way he does to let rip. If any cops want to mishandle the people in the back of their cars \u2013 as he encouraged them to do in a speech to police officers in 2017 \u2013 then he\u2019s going to look the other way. But this is a long way from finding people to do the beating up if the cops won\u2019t. Trump\u2019s rhetoric of violence is essentially reactive \u2013 it\u2019s all about how he\u2019s feeling. He is limited by his inability to see beyond the situation he finds himself in. That was true on 6 January as well \u2013 he wanted something so badly, he thought any means were justified in trying to get it. But he really didn\u2019t know how to get what he wanted. The result was a menace and a sham. Trump is an enabler, not an originator of political violence. He is too passive to be truly fascist.\n\nView image in fullscreen Trump supporters, including the \u2018QAnon shaman\u2019, storming the US Capitol on 6 January 2021. Photograph: Douglas Christian/Zuma Wire/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nTrump is also limited by the fact that he doesn\u2019t have his own political party. Fascism was a movement designed to take on, and ideally destroy, the established political parties. Trump had no means of becoming president except by becoming the Republican candidate first. Though he has brought the party over to his side, he still has to rely on its institutions and curry its favour. Fascism proper operates through brutal purges to ensure that only the true believers and their henchmen remain. The Republican party, for all its Trumpification, remains a relatively broad church, at least compared with the Nazi party after the Night of the Long Knives in 1934, when Hitler had his leading internal rivals murdered. Trump tries to control candidate selection by proffering or withholding his personal endorsement. If he doesn\u2019t like you, he will take you apart on his social media accounts. But he won\u2019t actually have you butchered.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Inside Saturday Free weekly newsletter The only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

His willingness to suggest a vast conspiracy against him \u2013 involving the \u201clying media\u201d (suggestive of the Nazi trope of \u201cL\u00fcgenpresse\u201d), foreigners, Marxists, un-American infiltrators and, occasionally, Jews \u2013 is redolent of the paranoid and poisonous propaganda of the Nazi era. So, too, is his readiness to conjure up a permanent sense of crisis to justify his vicious politics. From his 2017 inaugural address, which described a state of \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d in a \u201ctombstone\u201d nation, to his speech accepting the Republican nomination in July, where he described a world on the brink of collapse, Trump has never knowingly undersold the chaos. At the Republican National Convention he told his audience, \u201cThere is an international crisis, the likes of which the world has seldom been part of. Nobody can believe what\u2019s happening. War is now raging in Europe and the Middle East, a growing spectre of conflict \u2026 hangs over all of Asia, and our planet is teetering on the edge of world war three, and this will be a war like no other war because of the weaponry.\u201d He sure makes it sound like the 1930s.\n\nThe difference, though, is that 1930s fascism went out of its way to create international conflict in order to maintain the crisis conditions under which it flourished. It was a doctrine built on military aggression and territorial expansion. Trump wants the US out of these conflicts. In that respect, he is more like Lindbergh and his original America First movement of isolationists and neutralists. Trump\u2019s willingness to stand back from and if necessary endorse the Russian invasion of Ukraine is another instance of his enabling role when it comes to the erosion of the rule of law. Yet he has shown little appetite for the kind of deliberate confrontation and mass mobilisation on which fascism depends. In Mein Kampf Hitler made clear that his goal was the eradication of the enemy. In Trump\u2019s equivalent early account of his core beliefs \u2013 Trump: The Art of the Deal \u2013 he emphasised the necessity to \u201cfight back very hard\u201d when someone crosses you, especially if they are trying to stiff you in a real estate deal. But that is not the same as being ready to start world war three.\n\nUnquestionably there are those around Trump who are prepared to go much further. Steve Bannon, who played a leading role in Trump\u2019s election victory in 2016, has long endorsed the view that the \u201cJudeo-Christian\u201d world is engaged in a war to the death with global Islam. Bannon is plugged into a network of white supremacists who hover around websites such as Breitbart News. One of Bannon\u2019s acolytes has spent years trying to establish a \u201cgladiator school\u201d in Italy \u2013 the Academy for the Judeo-Christian West \u2013 in order to prepare warriors for the fight. That said, the academy has yet to open its doors, having got bogged down in a series of intractable lawsuits. Meanwhile, Bannon himself is serving jail time for refusing to obey a subpoena requiring him to appear before the US House select committee on the 6 January attack. If world war three begins, it won\u2019t be Bannon who starts it either.\n\nTrump is too fickle and essentially reactive to be a fascist. At the same time, the would-be fascists who have made him their cause are no nearer to running the show than they were in 2016. If anything, it is the illiberal authoritarians circling around Trump who carry the greater clout. Yet Trump is also too volatile and too haphazard to pass as a plausible authoritarian. He lacks the necessary discipline, which is why the project for some backers of Trump 2.0 has been to use him as a vehicle back into executive power, then sideline him. It is reminiscent of what some of the illiberal conservative elements in German politics believed about Hitler in 1933. We know how that worked out.\n\nView image in fullscreen With Kamala Harris at the presidential debate earlier this month. Photograph: ABC/Zuma Press Wire/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nToo flaky to be an actual fascist and too erratic to be a credible authoritarian. What, then, is he? Tomasky argues it is possible to spend so much time bogged down in the impossible conundrum of Trump\u2019s essential political personality that the basic threat he poses gets overlooked. He is a real and present danger to the American republic and the wider world. Under those circumstances, isn\u2019t \u201cfascist\u201d a useful shorthand for what he represents? But that depends on what the goal is. If it is to mobilise resistance against Trump, then it is far from clear that calling him a fascist does much good. To his supporters it sounds like an exaggeration \u2013 because that is what it is. For his opponents it is probably unnecessary \u2013 they don\u2019t need to compare him to Hitler to know what it is about him they don\u2019t like. For now, at least, the Harris-Tim Walz ticket seems to have achieved greater purchase among the few undecideds who are left by describing the Trump-Vance ticket as \u201cweird\u201d. In many ways it is the more accurate description.\n\nOn the other hand, if the aim is to characterise what makes Trump so dangerous, then the spectre of fascism seems like a distraction. The threat of him in the White House comes less from his core beliefs than from his essential flakiness under a political system that gives the president extraordinary, unchecked power. He might well start world war three by accident, simply because the occupant of the Oval Office gets to call the shots in foreign affairs. He is the one brokering the deals \u2013 and breaking them. He gets final say on the deployment of nuclear weapons. The imperial phase of the presidency long predates Trump and originated in the accumulation of executive power during the cold war. The real risk lies in putting a man with so little impulse control and such a strong sense of personal grievance at the head of the world\u2019s most powerful military machine. The world survived four years of Trump in the White House \u2013 but that was almost certainly luck rather than judgment. Another four years would be pushing our collective luck.\n\nThe president has less licence to create havoc in domestic matters. Nonetheless, decades of relative gridlock in Washington have seen a big expansion in the use of executive orders to bypass Congress. Trump\u2019s economic policies \u2013 protectionist, autarchic, interventionist \u2013 have some family resemblance to the ones pushed through by the Nazis but they also echo ideas found in all sorts of other settings, including on some parts of the US left. There is still some overlap between erstwhile Bernie Sanders\u2019 supporters and Trump\u2019s voting base of disaffected young men (about 10% of Sanders\u2019 voters are thought to have gone for Trump rather than Clinton in 2016). Bernie bros may be many things but they are not fascists. Hence it\u2019s not the genealogy of Trump\u2019s policy ideas that makes them hazardous. It is simply that a politician with no real sense of fiscal responsibility or financial accountability might get to play games with the US economy. It is America\u2019s system of government that makes Trump dangerous as much as it is Trump who is a danger to America\u2019s system of government.\n\nCalling a 21st-century politician a fascist is so damning \u2013 so much worse than any other label \u2013 because actual fascist regimes are very rare. One reason for that is none of them ever lasted. They were catastrophic failures \u2013 catastrophes not only for their friends and enemies but for the wider world \u2013 undone by their own appetite for relentless crisis and confrontation. Fascism was a product of a period of acute difficulty for western democracies. It arose in the aftermath of a world war, in the ruins of defeat, in places with weak democratic systems, in nations populated by very large numbers of angry young men (many of them traumatised by their experience of war), in a time of high unemployment, in the face of global economic collapse and in the shadow of Bolshevism. None of that is true of the US today. Making sense of the phenomenon of Trumpism means looking at a different set of circumstances \u2013 an ageing population, a social media revolution, de-industrialisation, educational divisions, increased competition from China, a backlash against feminism and growing resentment about illegal immigration. That is more than enough to destabilise US politics. But it is not the breeding ground for fascism.\n\nStill fascism could return. The 21st century has a long way to run and a combination of climate crisis, mass migration and technological upheaval, plus the possibility of bigger, nastier wars, may well create the conditions for a new version of the politics of permanent crisis, violently confrontational, racially motivated and catastrophic for everyone. Fixating on Trump as a symptom of this kind of politics is a mistake. Defeating him in November does nothing to guarantee the defeat of 21st-century fascism, because that depends on how governments around the world handle the crises to come. The more that goes wrong, the more fascism will find its footing again. But a victory for Trump could nevertheless be a cause of 21st-century fascism. Not because he is a fascist, but because he doesn\u2019t know how to govern and good government is the only guarantee against the worst form of politics returning. Trump is not and never has been a genuine exponent of fascism. In the end, he is too much of a cynical asshole. But for that reason he could yet be one of its enablers.",

Your commitment has brought us this far, and for that, I am deeply grateful. This victory belongs to all of us,\u201d Dissanayake said in a post on X.\n\nDissanayake, 55, leads the left-leaning coalition National People\u2019s Power, an umbrella of civil society groups, professionals, Buddhist clergy and students.\n\nThe election was a virtual referendum on Wickremesinghe\u2019s leadership of a fragile recovery, including restructuring Sri Lanka\u2019s debt under an International Monetary Fund bailout program after it defaulted in 2022.\n\nDissanayake had said he would renegotiate the IMF deal to make austerity measures more bearable. Wickremesinghe had warned that any move to alter the basics of the agreement could delay the release of a fourth tranche of nearly $3 billion that is crucial to maintaining stability.\n\nNeither candidate received more than 50% of the vote. Under the Sri Lankan election system that allows voters to select three candidates in the order of their preference, the top two are retained and the ballots of the eliminated candidates are checked for preferences given to either of the top two vote-getters. The one with the highest number of votes is declared the winner.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIt was a strong showing for Dissanayake, who won just over 3% of votes in a previous presidential election in 2019, and suggests voters are fatigued with the old political guard.\n\nWickremesinghe's Foreign Minister Ali Sabry congratulated Dissanayake and said he hopes he will \u201clead with a commitment to transparency, integrity, and the long-term good of the country.\u201d\n\nThe government announced Thursday that it passed the final hurdle in debt restructuring by reaching an agreement in principle with private bond holders. At the time of its default, Sri Lanka\u2019s local and foreign debt totaled $83 billion. The government says it has now restructured more than $17 billion.\n\nDespite a significant improvement in key economic figures, Sri Lankans are struggling with high taxes and living costs.\n\nSri Lanka\u2019s economic crisis resulted largely from excessive borrowing on projects that did not generate revenue. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the government\u2019s insistence on using scarce foreign reserves to prop up the currency, the rupee, contributed to the economy\u2019s free fall.\n\nThe economic collapse brought a severe shortage of essentials such as medicine, food, cooking gas and fuel, with people spending days waiting in line to obtain them. It led to rioting in which protesters took over key buildings including the president\u2019s house, his office and the prime minister\u2019s office, forcing then-President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to flee the country and resign.\n\nWickremesinghe was elected by a parliamentary vote in July 2022 to cover the remainder of Rajapaksa\u2019s five-year term.",

This year, he plans to vote for the American Solidarity Party \u2014 a Christian democratic political party that opposes abortion rights.\n\nQuinn said he knows candidates Peter Sonski and Lauren Onak \u2014 the ASP's ticket \u2014 will lose, but he says he believes his vote means something.\n\n\"If the American Solidarity Party\u2019s few votes for a truly pro-life vision are what costs the Republican ticket the election, hopefully in 2028 they take pro-lifers more seriously and aren't messing around on the issue the way they are this year,\u201d Quinn said.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nSince the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and handed abortion back to the states, reproductive rights have become a galvanizing political position. During the 2022 midterms, voters supported the abortion-rights option on ballot measures in five states \u2014 including Kentucky and Montana, which typically have more conservative voters\n\nHarris has made reproductive rights a key part of her candidacy. Meanwhile, Trump has flip-flopped on his abortion stance. Just last month, he indicated he would vote in favor of an abortion-access amendment in Florida, before later clarifying he'll vote no.\n\nFor Quinn, these two options left him no choice but to vote third party.\n\n\u201cI wouldn't even know how to weigh which is the lesser of two evils,\" Quinn said.\n\nIt's unclear how many voters Trump stands to lose over his position on abortions, but Onak \u2014 who is the vice presidential candidate on the ASP ticket \u2014 said her campaign has seen an increase in interest.\n\n\"After the GOP changed its platform language on abortion, we saw an increase in people reaching out to us, following us on social media, volunteering for the campaign,\" Onak said. \"We saw an increase in donations.\"\n\nIn July, the Republican Party, in new platform langue, removed references to supporting a national 20-week ban and a constitutional amendment restricting abortion.\n\nBeyond abortion, voters are also struggling with the Republican party's shifting economic and foreign policy position. Former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson is a self-described \"Reagan conservative\" who supports Ukraine in its war against Russia and believes in the rule of law. He also unsuccessfully sought the Republican presidential nomination this cycle.\n\n\"I expect to write in a good Republicans name on the ballot,\" Hutchinson said. \"I'm going to stick with my pledge that I'm not going to support a convicted felon [Trump], and that's the reasons for it.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nSeveral high-profile Republicans, including Trump-era officials, have said they will back Harris, but Hutchinson said he believes many Republicans are in the same position as him: and will write in the name of another candidate.\n\nGreen Party 'earned my vote' over war in Gaza\n\nIn white text on a black background, Anton Navazo posted a paragraph on Instagram explaining his support for the Green Party's Jill Stein \u2014 and his rejection of both Harris and Trump.\n\n\"First and foremost, I'm opposed to both the Republican and Democratic support for the Israeli government's actions in Palestine, and I like that the Green Party is too,\" Navazo said in a phone call while packing up for a move to Seattle.\n\nNavazo voted for Biden in the last election. He has little hope Stein will win in 2024, but said it could matter for 2028.\n\n\"If either the Democrats or the Republicans think that the Green Party or a third-party vote is why they lost the election, then I think that the next election cycle, they need to try harder to earn the votes of those people,\" Navazo said.\n\nRoman Fritz, a 20-year-old college student in Wisconsin, said he largely agreed with Navazo, but is conflicted.\n\n\"In November, I think I plan to vote for Harris,\" Fritz said pausing. \"I do plan to vote for Harris. However, I'm not going to campaign for Harris. I'm not going to encourage anybody to vote for Harris.\"\n\nFritz was the only delegate from the badger state to vote \"present\" during the nomination of Harris at the Democratic National Convention. And he supports the Green Party's Stein on the issues, but can't stomach a Trump victory .\n\n\"I think that the only candidate that could win are Trump or Kamala Harris,\" Fritz said. \"Kamala Harris is the better of the two. My heart definitely, like, isn't fully there just because of the lack of a coherent cease-fire plan\" in Gaza.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nLast Thursday, leaders of the \"uncommitted\" movement, a Democratic group that opposes Biden's policy toward Israel and Gaza, said they won't endorse Harris \u2014 but encouraged Americans to vote against Trump.\n\nHundreds of thousands of voters cast \"uncommitted\" ballots during the Democratic primary in several states \u2014 including Michigan and Wisconsin. Biden was at the top of the ticket then, and while Harris has garnered support from younger more liberal voters, it remains unclear how many will vote against Harris over her support of Israel.\n\n\n\n'Wednesday morning' thought experiment\n\nSingle-issue voters feeling left in the lurch by both Harris and Trump face a dilemma in an election with high stakes.\n\nArchon Fung, a Harvard political science professor who teaches a course titled Politics and Ethics in Unstable Times \u2014 offered a solution to voters caught in indecision.\n\n\"If you're not in a close state, it's probably OK to really vote your values and vote for a third-party candidate,\" Fung said because that vote won't throw the election either way. \"But if you're in a state that is very close Electoral-College wise, then it's a much, much more difficult decision for you.\"\n\nRegardless, he said voters have to \"own that choice\" if they cast a ballot for a third-party candidate \u2014 say Stein \u2014 in a swing state like Wisconsin and their least preferred candidate wins \u2014 Trump, for example.\n\nIn this case, Fung suggested the voter close their eyes and imagine it's Nov. 6.\n\n\"It's Wednesday morning and it's a Trump win in Wisconsin, and Wisconsin is decisive in the Electoral College,\" Fung said. \"What do you say to yourself when you look yourself in the mirror?\"\n\nIf the answer is \"I'm OK\" \u2014 then vote third party, Fung said. But if your answer is \"what have I done?\", then vote for the best between the major candidates.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"I would like for everyone to kind of run through that thought experiment,\" the Harvard professor said. \"What do I say to myself on Wednesday morning?\"",

Trump\u2019s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, is set to square off against Harris\u2019 vice presidential pick, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, on October 1 in a debate hosted by CBS.\n\nTrump suggested last week that he might be open to participating in a third presidential debate following his September 10 face-off with Harris hosted by ABC in Philadelphia. \u201cMaybe if I got in the right mood,\u201d he told reporters during a stop in California, after previously posting on Truth Social, \u201cTHERE WILL BE NO THIRD DEBATE!\u201d\n\nTrump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung referred CNN to that Truth Social post when asked Saturday whether the former president would accept the debate invitation.\n\nHarris\u2019 campaign last week dismissed Trump\u2019s announcement that there would not be another debate, with one senior adviser saying the former president \u201cchanges his position every day.\u201d The vice president, meanwhile, immediately called for another debate, saying, \u201cI believe we owe it to the voters.\u201d\n\nThe October debate would mirror the first 2024 presidential debate in June between Trump and President Joe Biden, taking place at CNN\u2019s studios in Atlanta, according to the network. Trump and Harris would field moderators\u2019 questions for 90 minutes without a live studio audience.\n\n\u201cBoth Vice President Harris and former President Trump received an invitation to participate in a CNN debate this fall as we believe the American people would benefit from a second debate between the two candidates for President of the United States,\u201d the network said in a statement. \u201cWe look forward to receiving a response from both campaigns so the American public can hear more from these candidates as they make their final decision.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s debate between Trump and Biden on June 27 proved a consequential showdown that upended the course of the campaign. After a dismal performance at that Atlanta debate, Biden eventually bowed out of the race and endorsed Harris as the Democratic nominee.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.\n\nCNN\u2019s Kate Sullivan contributed to this report.",

        "text": "Historian who predicted 9 of the last 10 elections says 2024 pick set off 'avalanche'\nAmericans spent the summer eagerly awaiting two pivotal political statements.\n\nThe first was Taylor Swift\u2019s endorsement of Kamala Harris, who ascended to the top of the Democratic ticket after Joe Biden ended his reelection campaign. Swift formally backed the vice president moments after her debate with Donald Trump, calling her a \u201csteady-handed, gifted leader.\u201d\n\nThe second statement? It wasn\u2019t from another pop star. Instead, some election-watchers waited on pins and needles for a prediction from Allan Lichtman, a 77-year-old distinguished professor of history at American University who lives in Bethesda, Maryland.\n\nThat\u2019s because Lichtman has correctly predicted the outcome of almost every election for decades, except for the race in 2000. He uses a set of 13 \u201ckeys\u201d to make his picks, which range from economic indicators to candidates\u2019 charisma.\n\nHere\u2019s how his model works: If six or more of the keys cut against the party in the White House, they're predicted to lose. Otherwise, Lichtman forecasts the party in power will win again.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nLichtman earlier this month predicted Harris would defeat Trump, sending shockwaves among political observers and picking up wall-to-wall news coverage. He told USA TODAY he's received a larger response about his 2024 prediction than ever before.\n\n\u201cMaybe because of how high stakes this election is, and how extraordinary this election is: The sitting president stepping down right before the convention, the challenging candidate convicted of 34 felonies,\u201d Lichtman said.\n\n\u201cThis has been an avalanche.\u201d\n\nMore:Historian who accurately predicted 9 of last 10 presidential elections makes his 2024 pick\n\nWhy do Americans love political predictions?\n\nLichtman\u2019s work isn\u2019t your average academic research, and the professor\u2019s publications have drawn attention for years. But is there such a thing as a buttoned-up history professor who becomes an A-list election celebrity every four years?\n\nIf you search Lichtman\u2019s name online, video after video of the professor breaking down his \u201ckeys\u201d and weighing in on the latest election in interviews will flood your feed. You can watch him predict that Trump and his MAGA movement would defeat Hillary Clinton. You can read about his forecast that America would elect its first Black president in 2008.\n\nWhen asked about the response his predictions receive, Lichtman smiles and pauses before simply saying he and his family have been \u201cvery bemused.\u201d\n\n\u201cI've been amazed, in a sense, why they're so interested,\u201d Lichtman said. \u201cThey'll find out soon enough who won or lost, why do they need to know in advance?\u201d\n\nBut why are American politicos so drawn to all election-year predictions \u2013 not just Lichtman\u2019s? The professor said he believes \u201cit has to do with instant gratification.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe live in a society of instant gratification. That's part of it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe other part of it is, we live in a society of predictions. It's not just politics. Look at sports. Sports talk radio is constantly giving you predictions about what's going to happen in upcoming games. Are coaches going to be fired? Who's going to be traded and who isn't?\n\n\u201cIt's entertainment as well. You know, who's going to win the Oscar? When is this couple going to divorce? You know who's going to hook up with whom?\u201d he asked. \"It's everywhere.\"\n\nAfter all, Lichtman says the \"scandal\" key is his favorite of the 13 keys, calling it a much juicer step than weighing economic data or wins and losses in midterm elections.\n\nStill, the professor said a sea of interviews during election years isn't his favorite part about his work. Neither is keynoting conferences or other academic acclaim.\n\n\u201cThe best part of becoming known is when every day people come up to me to say that they admire what I do: security guards at AU, Uber drivers, waiters and waitresses,\u201d Lichtman said.\n\nKeeping up with Election 2024? Sign up for USA TODAY's On Politics newsletter.\n\nYes, he knows about the critics\n\nLichtman is no stranger to criticism. The responses to his picks aren't just questions from media or conversations with D.C.-area voters. This year alone, he said he\u2019s received messages accusing him of being a \u201cDemocratic tool\u201d or being paid by Harris.\n\nBut he\u2019s faced it for years.\n\nLichtman's first prediction was in 1982, when he said Ronald Reagan would win reelection. He developed the model with Vladimir Keilis-Borok, a Russian seismologist who worked at understanding not elections, but earthquakes.\n\nThe professor explains that the first pushback he received was from fellow forecasters.\n\n\u201cI had committed the cardinal sin of subjectivity. Some of my keys were not just cut and dried statistical indicators like economic growth,\u201d he explained. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018No, it's not subjectivity. It's judgment. We're dealing with human beings. Human beings make judgments all the time.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut as his work picked up steam, criticism also came from political operatives, journalists, pollsters and other analysts outside academic communities. These groups have long launched similar critiques, accusing his keys of being based on the opinions of the person deploying the model instead of static markers.\n\nLichtman\u2019s response? He\u2019d argue that his work does outline specific guidelines for each key. For example, a strong short-term economy doesn\u2019t simply refer to how the person applying the method thinks Americans feel about the economy. Instead, the factor asks whether the economy is in recession during an election campaign.\n\nThe professor still regularly responds to negative feedback online. But he says he tries to remember that, over the years, people have leveled accusations as personal as questioning whether his hair is real. \u201cAs if my hair had anything to do with my predictions,\u201d he said as he pulled on his brown locks to prove their legitimacy.\n\n\u201cBut I have to tell you,\" Lichtman noted. \u201cBeing attacked is not the worst thing that can happen to you. You know what the worst thing is? Being ignored. And I have not been ignored now for a good 20 years.\u201d\n\nLichtman calls it for Harris\n\nVirtually every major national poll has found the race within its margin of error and too close to call definitively.\n\nBut Lichtman earlier this month said his keys point to a historic victory for Harris this fall. That\u2019s because she didn\u2019t face a significant primary contest before becoming the Democratic nominee, there is no major third-party candidate after Robert F. Kennedy Jr. ended his presidential bid and Lichtman\u2019s definition for his model\u2019s two economic keys fall in her favor.\n\nHe also said Democrats haven\u2019t faced \u201csustained social unrest.\u201d Lichtman argued the pro-Palestinian protests over Gaza that have rocked parts of the country don\u2019t meet his bar for the key, along with other factors.\n\nIn 2000, Lichtman said eight of the 13 keys could be good news for Democrats, though Al Gore ultimately lost the race to George W. Bush after a protracted fight that ended up at the Supreme Court.\n\nLichtman did raise some eyebrows in June after he said Democrats shouldn\u2019t drop Biden, even after the president's disastrous debate performance, which sparked an uproar and lead to the end of his campaign.\n\nBut the professor explained that he thought Democrats were risking losing two keys as questions about Biden's reelection campaign grew: The power of incumbency and the role that primary contests can play. With Biden dropping out, Democrats sacrificed the immediate name recognition and other advantages that have long come with running for reelection.\n\nBut Harris didn't face the typical primary process for the Democratic nomination and didn't have to battle other politicians, so the left managed to salvage that component of Lichtman's model.\n\nAnd no, in case you were wondering, the recent Harris-Trump debate and the second assassination attempt targeting the former president don\u2019t change anything.\n\n\u201cNone of these ephemeral events, not the debate, not the purported attempted assassination, not JD Vance saying he made up a story about immigrants eating cats and dogs,\u201d Lichtman said. \u201cNone of that changes the fundamentals of the election. So none of it changes my prediction.\u201d\n\nx.com\n\nPolitical predictions ... and a senior Olympics?\n\nElections aren\u2019t the only races Lichtman knows about.\n\nHe\u2019s been a runner for 60 years, beginning when he was 16 and extending to today. He recently notched his own victories at the Maryland Senior Olympics, picking up bronze and gold medals and qualifying for next year\u2019s national competition.\n\nHis wife, Karyn Strickler, is a triathlete, and the couple has long enjoyed playing basketball together. Lichtman explained that when the two used to play what was supposed to be a friendly game, their friends would remark \u201cwhen Allan and Karyn play one-on-one, there's blood on the floor.\u201d\n\nStill, theirs is a family deeply interested in politics. Strickler is the founder and president of Vote Climate U.S. PAC, which \"works to elect candidates to eliminate all human-made, greenhouse gas emissions by 2050,\" according to its website. Lichtman hosts a regular live show on YouTube talking about politics with his son, Sam.\n\nLichtman gave USA TODAY one more reason he \u2013 and Americans from coast to coast \u2013 might be so interested in political predictions.\n\n\u201cIt's fun. It's interesting. I've been doing this for 40 years. I'm 77. I still get butterflies in my stomach every four years because I can be proved wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course, I could be wrong. Anyone could be wrong.\u201d\n\nContributing: Karissa Waddick, Elizabeth Beyer",

        "text": "Markets care if there is a tight race for president, study shows\nPrint this page\n\nYour guide to what the 2024 US election means for Washington and the world\n\nLatest news on ETFs Visit our ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and comparison tools\n\nWith less than two months to go until the US presidential election and with polls suggesting that the two leading candidates are neck and neck, it is unsurprising that some investors are getting jittery.\n\nNewly published research from Research Affiliates, the research consultancy and investment adviser, has revealed that those nerves are familiar and translate into predictable investor behaviour.\n\nThe paper, authored by Rob Arnott, chair of Research Affiliates \u2014 which made its name developing smart beta strategies that adjust broad market indices to emphasise factors such as value \u2014 and Forrest Henslee, vice-president of research, shows that the political affiliation of the winning candidate in US elections had less bearing on markets than how close and contentious the election was.\n\nThey looked at the 24 US elections since 1928 and found that stocks in the S&P 500 tend to fall in the run-up to a close election, then surge in the final week of the campaign before continuing their upswing, albeit with greater volatility, post-election day.\n\n\u201cWe believe this is due to fear of the outcome increasing \u2014 on both sides of the aisle \u2014 ahead of the election and then dissipating, on one side of the aisle,\u201d the authors wrote.\n\nThey noted that after the election differences between political outcomes could be observed. So, while in the lead-up to an election, growth and value stocks tend to exhibit similar performance, after the election, value stocks tend to rebound when Republicans win the White House, while growth stocks tend to rebound when Democrats take office.\n\nFor short-term investors, therefore, the Research Affiliates findings suggest that keeping a close eye on close elections makes a lot of sense.\n\nBut there are other important messages from researchers for investors with a longer-term view. Morningstar research published in June, for example, looked at S&P 500 returns over 50 years. It found that since 1953, $1,000 invested when a Democrat is president, sold when a Republican takes office, then reinvested when a Democrat returns turns into $62,000. The opposite strategy \u2014 only investing when a Republican sits in the Oval Office \u2014 only grows to $27,000. However, doing nothing and leaving the $1,000 where it was for the duration would have reaped investors $1.7mn by the end of 2023.\n\nHowever, Arnott pointed out that the Morningstar observations focused on the returns over a four-year presidential term, whereas Research Affiliates focused on the six weeks before and after an election.\n\nHe also argued that while long-term figures suggest a Democratic presidency is better than a Republican presidency for stock markets, these results are distorted by the 1929 Wall Street crash and the ensuing Great Depression, and the financial crisis of 2008 that blotted Republicans\u2019 copybooks.\n\nFrom 1860 to 1920, the opposite was the case, he said.\n\n\u201cOur conclusion from the mixed results is that either party can pursue policies that allow prosperity; and either party can pursue policies that crush initiative. But, this was not the point of our paper, which focused on the weeks surrounding an election,\u201d Arnott said.\n\nThe Research Affiliates paper seems to confirm that we tend to act on our short-term hunches. A victory for Donald Trump, for example, has sparked fears in some quarters that there could be significant consequences for electric-vehicle makers and the EV battery suppliers that power them.\n\nHowever, even in trying to make sectoral decisions, investors could end up wrongfooted. Financial Times columnist Stuart Kirk points out that while President Joe Biden, with his green spending and incentives, might have been expected to have been bad for extractive industries, US oil and gas companies represent the fourth-best performing domestic sector during Biden\u2019s administration.\n\nIt might be wise, therefore, to ignore the news when checking your portfolio.\n\n\u201cGenerally, we would caution investors against attempting to time the market based on political views or short-term patterns based on previous elections,\u201d said Andrew Prosser, head of investments at InvestEngine, the UK ETF investment platform.\n\n\u201cMarket-timing, especially over such short time periods, is a fool\u2019s errand for investors, as it has proven impossible to do successfully historically. Instead, investors should keep their eyes focused on the long run,\u201d he added.",

That includes AI-generated content \u201cof and about prominent U.S. figures\u201d and material seeking to emphasize divisive issues such as immigration. Officials said that\u2019s consistent with the Kremlin\u2019s broader goal to boost former President Donald Trump and denigrate Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nBut Russia is also using lower-tech methods. The ODNI official said Russian influence actors staged a video in which a woman claimed to be a victim of a hit-and-run by Harris in 2011. There\u2019s no evidence that ever happened. Last week, Microsoft also said Russia was behind the video, which was spread by a website claiming to be a nonexistent local San Francisco TV station.\n\nRussia is also behind manipulated videos of Harris\u2019s speeches, the ODNI official said. They may have been altered using editing tools or with AI. They were disseminated on social media and using other methods.\n\n\u201cOne of the efforts we see Russian influence actors do is, when they create this media, try to encourage its spread,\u201d the ODNI official said.\n\nThe official said the videos of Harris had been altered in a range of ways, to \u201cpaint her in a bad light both personally but also in comparison to her opponent\u201d and to focus on issues Russia believes are divisive.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIran has also tapped AI to generate social media posts and write fake stories for websites posing as legitimate news outlets, officials said. The intelligence community has said Iran is seeking to undercut Trump in the 2024 election.\n\nIran has used AI to create such content in both English and Spanish, and is targeting Americans \u201cacross the political spectrum on polarizing issues\u201d including the war in Gaza and the presidential candidates, officials said.\n\nChina, the third main foreign threat to U.S. elections, is using AI in its broader influence operations that aim to shape global views of China and amplify divisive topics in the U.S. such as drug use, immigration, and abortion, officials said.\n\nHowever, officials said they had not identified any AI-powered operations targeting the outcome of voting in the U.S. The intelligence community has said Beijing\u2019s influence operations are more focused on down-ballot races in the U.S. than the presidential contest.\n\nU.S. officials, lawmakers, tech companies, and researchers have been concerned about the potential for AI-powered manipulation to upend this year\u2019s election campaign, such as deepfake videos or audio depicting candidates doing or saying something they didn't or misleading voters about the voting process.\n\nWhile those threats may yet still materialize as election day draws closer, so far AI has been used more frequently in different ways: by foreign adversaries to improve productivity and boost volume, and by political partisans to generate memes and jokes.\n\nOn Monday, the ODNI official said foreign actors have been slow to overcome three main obstacles to AI-generated content becoming a greater risk to American elections: first, overcome guardrails built into many AI tools without being detected; second, develop their own sophisticated models; and third, strategically target and distribute AI content.\n\nAs Election Day nears, the intelligence community will be monitoring for foreign efforts to introduce deceptive or AI-generated content in a variety of ways, including \u201claundering material through prominent figures,\u201d using fake social media accounts or websites posing as news outlets, or \u201creleasing supposed \u2018leaks\u2019 of AI-generated content that appear sensitive or controversial,\u201d the ODNI report said.\n\nEarlier this month, the Justice Department accused Russian state broadcaster RT, which the U.S. government says operates as an arm of Russian intelligence services, of funneling nearly $10 million to pro-Trump American influencers who posted videos critical of Harris and Ukraine. The influencers say they didn\u2019t know the money came from Russia.",

He says the Republican candidate is a \u2018man of principles\u2019 and \u2018the right choice\u2019, despite disagreements on some issues . Hamtramck, Michigan, made headlines in 2021 when it became the first US city to elect an all-Muslim mayor .",
        "text": "Mayor of only Muslim-run city in US endorses Trump for election\nAmer Ghalib, who leads city in battleground state of Michigan, says the Republican is the \u2018right choice\u2019, despite disagreements.\n\nThe mayor of the only city in the United States with an all-Muslim government has endorsed former President Donald Trump for November\u2019s presidential election.\n\nAmer Ghalib, who leads the city of Hamtramck in the crucial battleground state of Michigan, said on Sunday that the Republican candidate is a \u201cman of principles\u201d and \u201cthe right choice\u201d, despite their disagreements on some issues.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump and I may not agree on everything, but I know he is a man of principles,\u201d Ghalib said in a post on Facebook.\n\n\u201cThough it\u2019s looking good, he may or may not win the election and be the 47th president of the United States, but I believe he is the right choice for this critical time. I\u2019ll not regret my decision no matter what the outcome would be, and I\u2019m ready to face the consequences.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, let the Caravan begin its journey,\u201d Ghalib added. \u201cThis is just the starting point.\u201d\n\nTrump reposted Ghalib\u2019s endorsement on his Truth Social platform shortly after the announcement.\n\nHamtramck, which has a population of about 28,000 people, made headlines in 2021 when it became the first US city to elect an all-Muslim City Council and a Muslim mayor.\n\nGhalib, who immigrated to the US from Yemen when he was 17, offered his support to Trump a little less than a week after meeting the Republican candidate before a town hall in the Michigan city of Flint.\n\nGhalib told The Detroit News last week that the pair had discussed the concerns of Arab and Muslim Americans and that Trump had requested his endorsement.\n\nMichigan is one of seven key swing states expected to decide the outcome of November\u2019s contest between Trump and his Democratic Party rival, Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nOpinion polls suggest a tight race between Trump and Harris both nationally and in battlegrounds such as Michigan.\n\nIn the most recent average of polls compiled by The New York Times, Harris leads Trump in Michigan by 50 percent to 47 percent.\n\nTrump won Michigan in the 2016 election against Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, becoming the first Republican to prevail in the state since George HW Bush in 1988.\n\nPresident Joe Biden flipped the state back to the Democrats in 2020, beating Trump by a margin of about 150,000 votes.\n\nMuslim-American anger over the Biden administration\u2019s support for Israel\u2019s war on Gaza has become a concern for Democrats as they face razor-thin races in the battleground states.\n\nIn a poll released by the Council on American-Islamic Relations in August, just 12 percent of Muslim voters in Michigan expressed support for Harris, with 18 percent backing Trump and 40 percent supporting the Green Party\u2019s Jill Stein.\n\nOn Thursday, the Uncommitted National Movement, a grassroots campaign aimed at pressuring Democrats to end their support for the war, announced that it would not endorse Harris after her team failed to meet a September 15 deadline to respond to a request for a meeting with families of Palestinians killed in Gaza.",

        "text": "Poland\u2019s president urges Polish Americans to vote in US presidential election\nPoland\u2019s president, Andrzej Duda, has urged Polish Americans to vote in this year\u2019s US presidential election during a visit to Pennsylvania. He argued that, by making their voice heard, they can ensure continued US support for Poland.\n\nDuda was speaking at the National Shrine of Our Lady of Czestochowa, a Polish-American Catholic shrine. He had been invited there to unveil a new memorial to those who fought to overthrow Poland\u2019s communist regime.\n\nInitially, there were plans for Donald Trump \u2013 an ally of Duda \u2013 to also attend. However, those were shelved in the days leading up to the event, with media reports suggesting there were concerns over ensuring security for Trump at the location.\n\nInstead, Trump sent out a post on social media congratulating the \u201camazing Polish-American community\u201d and \u201cmy great friend, Polish President Andrzej Duda\u201d on the unveiling of the monument to \u201cthe brave heroes who fought for Poland\u2019s independence\u201d.\n\nThere are almost 9 million self-declared Polish Americans in the US, representing around 2.7% of the country\u2019s population. Particularly large numbers of them are located in states seen as key battlegrounds in this year\u2019s presidential elections, such as Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania itself.\n\nSpeaking at the National Shrine on Sunday, Duda told Polish Americans that, although \u201cyou live far away, your voice is important for Poland, for its security, for its survival\u2026Your political strength, your votes cast in American elections, decide the future of America but also the future of Poland\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt was also thanks to your support that we regained freedom in 1989, and in 1999 we were accepted into NATO, which today is the foundation of our security\u2026[including] through the modernisation of the Polish armed forces in cooperation with the United States,\u201d continued Duda.\n\nWith regard to the latter, he then specifically mentioned that it was \u201cduring the administration of President Donald Trump that the decision was made that Poland would enter the F-35 programme\u201d to receive the US-made combat aircraft.\n\nThe F-35 combat aircraft being produced by Lockheed Martin for Poland has been unveiled at its headquarters in Texas. The Polish version of the plane has been named \"Husarz\" in reference to Poland's famous \"Winged Hussar\" cavalry units https://t.co/Zk1BSxQnmd \u2014 Notes from Poland \ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf1 (@notesfrompoland) August 28, 2024\n\nDuda warned, however, that \u201cfor America to have this extremely important function\u2026and for Poland to have its guarantee your vote is needed\u201d.\n\n\u201cThat is why I ask you to go to the American elections. Not only the upcoming presidential elections, but every election, so that the strength of the Polish community in America determines the strength of the homeland,\u201d said the president.\n\nSpeaking later to broadcaster Republika, Duda emphasised that a strong Poland is also vital to the US. He noted that Poland\u2019s strategic location \u2013 connecting the Baltic states to the rest of NATO and as a hub for transport to Ukraine \u2013 helps \u201cdetermine the security of our part of Europe\u201d.\n\nPoland has enjoyed close relations with the US under both the Trump and Biden administrations, as well as under both the former Law and Justice (PiS) government in Warsaw \u2013 with which Duda was allied \u2013 and the current ruling coalition led by Prime Minister Donald Tusk.\n\nEarlier this year, in a rare show of unity between two otherwise rivals, Duda and Tusk visited the White House together to mark the 25th anniversary of Poland joining NATO.\n\n\n\nNotes from Poland is run by a small editorial team and published by an independent, non-profit foundation that is funded through donations from our readers.

Across all three states, the polling points to Trump\u2019s advantages on key metrics, especially on handling the economy.\n\nIn Arizona, Trump tops Harris 48% to 43% in a matchup including the names of third-party candidates who will appear on the ballot there. In Georgia, Trump holds 47% support to Harris\u2019 44% and in North Carolina, it stands at 47% Trump to 45% Harris. There is no clear leader in the race in Georgia and in North Carolina.\n\nIn North Carolina, the poll finds Democrat Josh Stein leading in the gubernatorial contest there, with 47% support to 37% for Republican Mark Robinson. The poll was conducted September 17-21 and was mostly complete before CNN reporting on Robinson\u2019s past comments on a porn website emerged.\n\nAcross the three states, Trump holds double-digit advantages over Harris among likely voters as more trusted to handle the economy (up 14 points on this score in Arizona, 13 in North Carolina and 12 in Georgia), and is more broadly seen as having policies that have \u201chelped people like you\u201d than Harris is (across all three states, 45% say Trump\u2019s policies have helped people like themselves, 34% that they\u2019ve hurt; for Harris, 42% say her policies would hurt people like themselves, 37% that they would help).\n\nIn all three, likely voters are narrowly more likely to say that they trust Trump over Harris to handle whichever issue they name as the most important (50% say they trust Trump on that, 46% Harris).\n\nThe two candidates are about even in favorability across the three states, a contrast with some recent national polling finding Harris viewed more positively than Trump (across all three, Trump stands at 47% favorable to 50% unfavorable, while Harris is at 46% favorable to 51% unfavorable).\n\nMore on the polls: The polls were conducted by telephone Sept. 17-21 among 713 voters in Arizona, and 682 each in Georgia and North Carolina. Results among likely voters have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4.4 points in Arizona, 4.6 in Georgia and 4.2 in North Carolina. For results combined across the three states, the error margin is plus or minus 2.5 points.",

        "text": "Republican bid to change Nebraska voting rules to help Trump fails\nA Republican attempt to change the electoral system in Nebraska to give Donald Trump a possible advantage in the event of a tied presidential election has been rebuffed after a state legislator refused to back the plan.\n\nMike McDonnell, a former Democrat who crossed to the Republican party this year, said he would not vote to change the midwestern state\u2019s distribution of electors to the same winner-takes-all process that operates in most of the US.\n\nHis decision followed intense lobbying from both Republicans and Democrats, who anticipated that a change in the allocation of Nebraska\u2019s five electoral college votes could have have a decisive impact on the outcome of the 5 November poll.\n\nIt reduces the possibility that the former president and Kamala Harris could be tied on 269 electoral college votes each, a scenario that would throw the final say on the election\u2019s outcome to the House of Representatives.\n\nA tie scenario could have arisen if Trump earned five electoral votes \u2013 rather than four, as expected under the present set-up \u2013 from winning Nebraska, then won the four \u201cSun belt\u201d states of North Carolina, Georgia, Nevada and Arizona, while the vice-president carried the northern battlegrounds of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.\n\nUS presidential elections are not decided by the popular vote nationwide but by which candidate wins a majority of 538 electoral college votes, usually awarded to the winner of the popular vote in each state.\n\nNebraska\u2019s Republican legislators, egged on by Republicans on Capitol Hill, proposed to change the distribution of electors to ensure that Trump would be awarded all five electoral votes if, as expected, he wins the solidly pro-Republican state.\n\nThat would have upended the status quo under which Nebraska, unlike every other state apart from Maine, splits its allocation to give two to the presidential candidate that wins the popular vote while awarding the other three on the basis of who prevails in each of its three congressional districts.\n\nThe state\u2019s second congressional district, covering its biggest city, Omaha, was won by Joe Biden in 2020, a feat Harris hopes to emulate.\n\nThe spotlight had fallen on McDonnell, a former firefighter and the chair of Omaha\u2019s federation of labour, because his support would have provided the two-thirds majority needed in the state legislature to change Nebraska\u2019s distribution system law, which has operated since 1992.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Stakes \u2014 Presidential Transition Free newsletter We will guide you through the aftermath of the US election and the transition to a Trump presidency Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After deep consideration, it is clear to me that right now, 43 days from election day, is not the moment to make this change.\u201d\n\nHis announcement came despite a meeting with the Republican senator Lindsey Graham, a close Trump ally, who travelled to Nebraska last week to lobby local legislators, and appeared to end plans by Jim Pillen, Nebraska\u2019s governor, to call a special legislative session to change the law.\n\n\u201cWith Mike McDonnell being an absolute no, that kind of closes the lid,\u201d the Republican state senator Loren Lippincott told the Nebraska Examiner newspaper.\n\nMcDonnell\u2019s stance won praise from a former ally, Jane Kleeb, the chair of Nebraska\u2019s Democrats, who hailed him for \u201cstanding strong against tremendous pressure from out-of-state interests to protect Nebraskans\u2019 voice in our democracy\u201d.",

Alexander Kazakov, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP\n\nRussian AI content has sought to exploit hot-button issues to further divide Americans, the ODNI said.\n\n\"The IC also assesses that Russian influence actors were responsible for altering videos of the vice president's speeches,\" the official said.\n\nRussia's altering of videos runs the \"gamut\" from painting her in a personal bad light, in comparison to her opponent and they are using both AI and staged videos, the official said.\n\nDemocratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris speaks to members of the media upon her arrival at Andrews Air Force Base, Md., Sept. 22, 2024. Matt Rourke/AP, Pool\n\nThe country was targeting President Joe Biden's former campaign, but once he dropped out of the race it had to \"adapt\" to targeting the vice president's campaign, the official said.\n\n\"Russia is a much more sophisticated actor in the influence space in general, and they have a better understanding of how U.S. elections work and what states to target,\" an ODNI official said.\n\nIran has also used AI in its election influence efforts, including help in writing fake social media posts and news articles to further Iran's objectives, which are to denigrate the former President Donald Trump's candidacy, the official said.\n\nIran is also using AI to sow discord on hot-button issues, an official said.\n\n\"One of the benefits of generative AI models is to overcome various language barriers, and so Iran can use the tools to help do that, and so one of the issues that could be attractive or using foreign language for that is immigration,\" an ODNI official said. \"The reason why Iran is focused on immigration is because they perceive it to be a divisive issue in the United States, and they identify themes, and this is broadly speaking, they identify themes with which they think will create further discord in the United States.\"\n\nMembers of the Iranian Army's land force stand at attention while one of them holds an Iranian flag during a military parade commemorating the anniversary of the Iran-Iraq War (1980-88) outside the Khomeini Shrine in the south of Tehran, Iran, Sept. 21, 2024. Morteza Nikoubazl/NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\nOfficials have previously assessed Iran prefers that Vice President Harris win the 2024 election.\n\nChina has also been using AI to generate fake news anchors and social media content with pro-China propaganda, they said.\n\nThe intelligence community assesses that AI is an \"accelerant\" to influence operations, but the risk to U.S. elections depends the ability of foreign actors to overcome restrictions built into many AI tools and remain undetected, develop their own sophisticated models, and strategically target and disseminate such content.\n\nAdversaries are also using AI to go back and forth with people in the comments.\n\nAs to whether what occurred in 2020 might happen again -- where the election might not be called on Election Day -- this period is something the IC is \"watching\" closely and is of \"great interest.\"\n\n\"The various influence actors have fairly steady state influence operations that seek the stoking of division and undermine U.S. democracy,\" an ODNI official said.\n\nDuring the Democratic primaries, the use of an AI generated robocall was used to give misinformation about voting the result was state criminal charges being brought against the individual who sent the recording and an FCC fine.\n\nA foreign adversary engaging in that tactic would be a \"top concern\" for intelligence officials, an official said.",

As a matter of fact, I have heard more about abortion than Africa over the last three months. The only time, I think, that peripherally Africa comes into view, or has come into view in this campaign, is when references have been made to immigration. But, to be honest, it has been more about Latin America, for obvious reasons, than Africa. So, the answer is no. I think I can explain that, honestly\u2014and I say that not because I think it\u2019s OK not to talk about Africa\u2014but such is the passion surrounding this particular election and such is the importance of many of the issues at stake: abortion, immigration, Gaza, American democracy itself, national security. Such is the intensity around it that one might actually excuse the two candidates for not putting Africa on the front burner.\n\nWhat do you think? Have you heard different?\n\nMG: I share your assessment that, no, no one is talking about Africa, even in the context of explicit foreign policy discussions. That isn\u2019t terribly new, having watched other U.S. presidential campaign seasons. Occasionally there have been issues, the Darfur crisis for example, that sort of rose to the level of needing to be addressed by these campaigns.\n\nBut, I do think it is a huge problem, actually. So, on one hand, I agree with you, it is ridiculous to expect candidates trying to win the votes of the American people\u2014who, yes, are concerned about their reproductive rights, their job prospects, immigration\u2014it\u2019s unreasonable to expect a deep dive into every region of the world. But, I do worry that in the context of national security concerns, there is an anachronistic idea that Africa is a peripheral part of the world that doesn\u2019t affect the United States.\n\nIn very different ways, both major presidential candidates appeal to this idea of U.S. global leadership and that we\u2019ll be respected in the world. It\u2019s a huge \u201cmiss\u201d to be ignoring the youngest region, one of the most dynamic regions\u2014this huge swathe of the world where our policies are, in many cases, not fit for purpose anymore.\n\nEO: I agree. Since we\u2019re looking for explanations for what obviously is a problem, I also wonder the extent to which the neglect is a function of the moment itself, especially the criticism coming from a section of the political spectrum about having given too much attention to foreign affairs, having spent a considerable amount of money on all these international initiatives, whereas the focus should be on what\u2019s happening in our own backyard. I wonder the extent to which that also explains the neglect that you and I agree is there.\n\nMG: I think that makes all the sense in the world. I don\u2019t fault any American for being concerned first about their family, their community. That makes sense to me. But, it is frustrating sometimes not to see that bridge being built from their concerns to the foreign policy world.\n\nSo, in this election in particular, we have two candidates who are known quantities. There\u2019s been a Trump administration before, and presumably, another one would pursue a similar approach to relationships in Africa as the first time around. How would you characterize that? What would you say about how the first Trump administration engaged with Africa?\n\nEO: To some extent, maybe also because of the overall character of the administration, what it did in Africa, I think, probably, went under the radar.\n\nSo, if you look at every major administration over the last fifty years, there has always been a signature policy. When you think of the Clinton administration, you think of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). When you think of the George W. Bush administration, you think of the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). President Trump actually had an Africa policy that was broadly consistent with that\u2014I think it was called Prosper Africa. I think the main idea was to ease the cost of doing business, to smooth the process of doing business, between U.S. and African business interests. To that extent, you could say that the Trump administration had a plan for Africa.\n\nSo, to respond to your earlier question, one might expect a continuation of that: a business-focused policy that privileges American interests, but at the same time privileges African interests. But, here is the other thing, and I\u2019m hoping that maybe you too address this, which is that the general attitude towards Africa has shifted dramatically in the short four years that President Trump has not been in office.\n\nWe\u2019ve had a major epidemic. Now, he was in power when the epidemic started and all of that, and we\u2019ve gone through that, but we\u2019ve since had the war in Ukraine and the consequences that came in the wake of that. It\u2019s a different geostrategic environment, and one in which, arguably, the United States has lost considerable ground to some of the competition, especially China and Russia.\n\nSo, how will a second Trump presidency [respond]\u2014I will later address that\u2014I think is the question that we should be asking. I expect some form of continuity, as I said earlier, with respect to American business interests in Africa, but whether we like it or not, I think a next Trump administration or a Harris administration will have to come to terms with the fact that it is no longer the Africa that was there four years ago, that things have changed drastically.\n\nMG: I think you\u2019ve hit on a couple really important points there. First, we have the multi-layered nature of messages and policies that seemed to be coming out of the Trump administration, where you had at the top this very dismissive, disrespectful tone, while in the workings of government, you had the standing up of Prosper Africa, which was a bringing together of a lot of elements of the U.S. government that were intended to help ease and promote doing business on the continent.\n\nBut then, remember when John Bolton made this speech rolling out their Africa strategy, and it was very much framed in the context of major power competition. We\u2019re going to get out there, compete with China, and push back against rising Chinese power, which is interesting to think about in light of what you just pointed out, which are these shifting geopolitical dynamics. There are so many different external actors who see Africa as a critical part of their grand strategy going forward, and, I think you\u2019re right, even less confidence in the United States to take the interests of African populations necessarily into account.\n\nThe other thing that I would throw into the mix on President Trump is the unwillingness to recognize the science around climate change, which makes it awfully hard to talk to your partners about the hugely consequential and really damaging effects that climate change is having on the continent and some of those big structural questions around loss and damage and climate finance. It\u2019s as if the United States just walks out of the room when that conversation happens, and I think it\u2019s an important one on the continent.\n\nSo, what about Vice President Harris? Should we expect a continuation of the Biden administration\u2019s approach, or how might it differ? It\u2019s interesting to note that she did take a trip to the continent as Vice President, visiting Ghana, Tanzania, and Zambia, whereas President Biden did not, to many people\u2019s disappointment. But, what do you think? Is it basically all of one piece, or do you see anything from the Harris campaign that suggests we might be striking out in a slightly different direction?\n\nEO: The answer is, I don\u2019t know yet. I am saying that because of my answer to the first question, which is, we don\u2019t know what either might do because neither candidate is talking a whole lot about Africa at the moment. We\u2019re just making inferences and extrapolations based on the fact President Trump had one presidency and Vice President Harris is part of the Biden presidency.\n\nI think, maybe, a couple of elements that we can throw into the mix when you think about a possible Harris presidency is the fact that she is a woman and the fact that she is black. I think those things, and I\u2019m sure we\u2019re going to talk about them further, factor into the way people appreciate her, think about her, and talk about her. The appraisal is overwhelmingly positive. And, she certainly did not hurt her chances by the visit that you refer to, that she took to Africa. But, that brings a lot of pressure. I\u2019m trying to think back to the Obama presidency, where [Africans felt] \u201cyou are President Obama, you have Kenyan ancestry, you are our son, and the pressure is on you to deliver something.\u201d What that thing is, Michelle, nobody ever says.\n\nMG: No, they don\u2019t. And, as you know, I worked for President Obama, and the flip-side of it is the worry that domestically, you\u2019ll be perceived as \u201ctoo engaged\u201d in Africa because of your personal connection and not on behalf of the American people.\n\nEO: Exactly. So, you\u2019re supposed to deliver the goods. You\u2019re an American president, first and last. At the same time, you\u2019re supposed to have some symbolic appeal to this particular constituency, and not illegitimately, because they have a certain claim on you. So, I think that element is going to be very interesting in the way we think about Vice President Harris, especially if she becomes President Harris. I think the positive part of that is, she might respond to that pressure in a very positive way, to think more creatively about the opportunities for the United States to deepen its alliances in Africa. The United States has got things going with a few countries, and those alliances are what\u2019s saving [them]. A few examples come to mind, Kenya being the most prominent of them.\n\nBut, also, enlarging that sphere and making sure that the United States tackles head-on the challenge by China, the challenge by Russia, while also not neglecting all the other conflicts that are going on in other parts of the continent that are affecting people in different ways.\n\nMG: Right, it\u2019s a really complex part of the world, and part of the challenge is figuring out where the United States has sufficient influence to make real progress\u2014here\u2019s what we\u2019d like to see happen and then there\u2019s what we have the influence to make progress on, and it\u2019s not the same list.\n\nI think that, yes, she might be very well positioned to think more creatively and to, perhaps, set a tone at the top that begins to chip away at the problems in the U.S. foreign policy establishment of considering Africa as peripheral and failing to apply the same rigorous thinking of what our interests are and how they align with our partners that we might apply in other parts of the world. We can certainly hope that that might be the case.\n\nWhat about the flip side? This election, for Americans, is certainly not about foreign policy, and it\u2019s certainly not about Africa policy. But, in Africa, our elections are followed, absolutely, and our discourse.\n\nWhat do you think, Ebenezer, about how the U.S. election is being perceived in different parts of the continent right now?\n\nEO: So, not unsurprisingly, there is a lot of interest. People may not be able to actually vote, but they are voting with their minds. I get calls from home, people asking me, \u201cYou are an American citizen now, who are you going to vote for?\u201d I think that speaks to the level of interest on the continent.\n\nBut this is where I think things can get a little bit tricky. I\u2019m going to talk from an immediate Nigerian standpoint, and I don\u2019t know the extent to which this applies to the rest of the continent. On one hand, there\u2019s interest in the \u201cAmerican project,\u201d and what becomes of it. People see America as a beacon. Africans are interested in the United States because there are millions of Africans here doing very well and sending money home. If they do well, people at home who are reliant on them do well. There\u2019s a lot of interest in America continuing to prosper and to flourish.\n\nBut there\u2019s this other concern, too, about what\u2019s happening across religious communities in Africa. I did this piece on President Trump a few weeks ago, which I called, \"A Second Coming?\" I was looking at the idea of the fact that if there\u2019s one constituency where support for President Trump has remained solid and unshakeable, it\u2019s among African Pentecostals. The reason is very simple: the enemy of my enemy is my friend. President Trump is perceived as being a major supporter of the Christian cause in the United States and, by inference, the Christian evangelical cause in Africa. I remember when former President Buhari of Nigeria came to visit, and he was with President Trump, and President Trump asked something along the lines of, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you protecting my African brothers and sisters?\u201d That played very well in Africa. I bring it up because that continues to affect the way people think about President Trump in a very positive way, that at the end of the day, no matter what happens, this is someone who might be relied on to fight the good Christian cause. That is affecting the way people perceive a possible second Trump coming versus a Harris presidency, the role of religion and the fact that President Trump is perceived as being a defender of the Christian cause in the United States and beyond.\n\nMG: It\u2019s really interesting, right? It raises all the questions we have domestically about the contradictions between President Trump\u2019s personal conduct, his personal religiosity, and his commitment to some of these positions that please a lot of evangelicals so much, particularly around reproductive rights. But, it\u2019s fascinating to think about this idea that there is a group of people he has identified as worthy of protection, worthy of using the voice, the power, of the U.S. presidency, to advocate for. I think that is a really interesting thing to think about in the context of some other parts of the continent where U.S. policy in Gaza right now, for example, is not at all popular, where there\u2019s long been a sympathy for the Palestinian people, and a sense that their experience of occupation has historical parallels in Africa under colonial rule or minority rule.\n\nIt\u2019s not so much the religious element, but this idea of who is worthy of standing up for? Who deserves protection, and who doesn\u2019t? It\u2019s an interesting idea to think about in terms of how the rest of the world perceives these candidates, and where the United States might be going.\n\nI also think I see a continued tarnishing of the brand, as it were, of democracy, just because there\u2019s already so many accusations of unfairness or that a certain outcome would clearly be unfair as former President Trump continues to recite his litany of grievances about the 2020 election. I do think this both diminishes U.S. stature but also is part of this toxic stew of the diminishment of the value of democratic governance itself. Does this really have any meaning, is it real, is it valuable at all, is it worth fighting for? That, I think, is a conversation that is really alive on the continent, and I see some connection there.\n\nEO: I completely agree, and I\u2019m glad that you brought this up because you couldn\u2019t emphasize this more, how important it is. We in the United States don\u2019t think enough about it, the extent to which our admittedly flawed and imperfect democracy still remains an exemplar to be held up and one that is looked upon as a reference point by people in different parts of the world.\n\nSo, as you were saying, I was thinking of the two sides of Trumpian, Christian, masculinity, and the way it plays out in Africa. The positive side is what I just spoke about, which is the idea of, in communities where there are fractures and tensions between Christians and Muslims, especially in a place like Nigeria where the Boko Haram insurgency has been a problem for decades now, an American president speaking for the Christian community is hugely welcome. One can, I think, understand and sympathize with that.\n\nThe dark side, the other side, of that masculinity, is where it verges into anti-democratic illiberalism. I\u2019m glad you brought this up because there\u2019s the whole specter of January 6 that continues to loom large\u2014we can\u2019t forget about it. Whether you are on the right or on the left in the United States, the sheer ugliness of that and what it means for our democracy, the idea that if somebody wins an election they are supposed to accept the result of the election, and the way that plays out in a continent where many democrats have embraced democracy reluctantly. Some leaders would rather be autocrats, and they are given the excuse of not accepting the result of an election. It\u2019s extremely important and, if anything, it\u2019s a reminder to both of us of how crucial and how important November\u2019s election is, how closely watched it\u2019s going to be from an African standpoint, and why it\u2019s important for the United States to put its best foot forward.\n\nMG: I couldn\u2019t agree more. So, just to finish up, let\u2019s indulge ourselves a little bit and imagine that a debate moderator would actually ask the candidates a question or two about Africa and U.S.-Africa relations.\n\nWhat should those questions be, and what kind of answers would you like to hear?\n\nEO: Maybe a combination of some of the things we\u2019ve been discussing this afternoon.\n\nOne, there is a changed strategic environment in Africa. We\u2019ve fallen behind, we\u2019ve lost some ground to China and Russia, at least that\u2019s the perception. What are you going to do about it? I think that would be an interesting question for the two candidates to answer.\n\nWe speak of Africa in terms of a profound demographic boom. It is the youngest continent. Population itself is not necessarily a virtue, but if we play our hands well, we\u2019re talking about hundreds of millions of people that can become the next stalwarts for democracy and that become the spirit for economic prosperity in Africa. What is your vision for turning those idle hands into active agents of prosperity and democracy?\n\nLast, but certainly not least, what do you do about climate change? How do you help the private sector, how do you help the public sector, how do you make sure that the conversation that has now started between people interested in climate change in the Global North and people interested in climate change in Africa does not stop?\n\nOn a more philosophical note, how do you make sure that you show solidarity without being guilty of intrusion? I\u2019m going back to some of the complaints about Western superciliousness and American arrogance. How do you make sure that you offer help without pointing an accusing finger at people and telling them what to do?\n\nThose three or four questions would be close to the top of the questions that I would ask. What about you?\n\nMG: You hit almost everything on my list, and I want to underscore your excellent point about humility and about recognizing that, ultimately, the course that different African states take is up to the citizens of those states, not us.\n\nIf we\u2019ve learned anything from our own turmoil in recent years, it should be that we don\u2019t come from some imagined place of perfect virtue, or a perfect democracy, or a perfect rule of law.\n\nI agree with your questions. I think I might even put a finer point on one, or about democracy. Why should these young populations, who want economic opportunity, who want jobs, who want services to be delivered to them, who if they\u2019re going to pay taxes want to know that those taxes don\u2019t wind up in somebody\u2019s pocket, as opposed to being invested in services for the public good, have faith? It\u2019s not that hard to understand why these surging crowds have come out in support of military seizures of power. The grievance base, as the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) put it, is quite vast.\n\nI would also add, since it\u2019s clear that the candidates have had to articulate positions on Ukraine, on Gaza, I do think that the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis, this horrifying war in Sudan, should be addressed. Even if the framing is, \u201cis it just a terrible tragedy that doesn\u2019t affect us,\u201d it would be interesting to hear the candidates try to work through where our interests lie, why there are reasons to be concerned about a collapsed Sudan, and what\u2019s happening to some international norms that are supposed to protect everybody around humanitarian access and other pieces. And so, I would love to see this crisis, that is so very deadly and disruptive, elevated to a topic that a U.S. president should have to respond to.\n\nEO: I totally agree.\n\nMG: Thanks so much for this chat, Ebenezer. It\u2019s always fun to talk with you. Maybe we\u2019ll be pleasantly surprised by the debate.",

        "summary": " George W Bush and Condoleezza Rice are the three most senior Republicans who have not come out against Donald Trump in this election cycle . Bush's office recently said he would not endorse, having \u201cretired from presidential politics years ago\u201d But he reportedly delivered on the dais at the Capitol after Trump\u2019s inaugural speech: \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d",
        "text": "\u2018Morally indefensible\u2019 \u2013 but George W Bush will not come out against Trump\nThe MSNBC host Lawrence O\u2019Donnell this week hit out at George W Bush, the Republican former president, for refusing to weigh in on America\u2019s looming presidential election.\n\n\u201cAll any decent person wants him to do is to say, \u2018Don\u2019t vote for Donald Trump, and here\u2019s why,\u2019 and he won\u2019t even do that,\u201d O\u2019Donnell told the Fast Politics podcast, of the Republican president who was in office from 2001 to 2009.\n\nIncreasingly, Bush \u2013 and some other top Republicans from his political era \u2013 are looking lonely in their ongoing refusal to take a side in an election in which many have warned that US democracy is under threat from Trump\u2019s open sympathies with autocracy.\n\nBush\u2019s vice-president Dick Cheney and his daughter Liz Cheney, whose January 6 committee role cost her a US House seat in Wyoming, have endorsed Kamala Harris. So have other senior Republicans, including more than 100 who this week signed a letter declaring that Trump, their party\u2019s nominee for a third election running, must never return to the White House.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the president of the United States must be a principled, serious and steady leader,\u201d the officials said. \u201cWe expect to disagree with Kamala Harris on many domestic and foreign policy issues, but we believe that she possesses the essential qualities to serve as president and Donald Trump does not.\u201d\n\nBig-name signatories included Chuck Hagel, a former senator and defense secretary; Gen Michael Hayden, a former CIA and NSA chief; and John Negroponte, once ambassador to the UN. Robert Zoellick, a longtime aide to both presidents Bush and a deputy to James Baker, secretary of state to the elder Bush, was on the list too.\n\nMissing from the list, however, were Baker, the younger Bush and his own secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice. As perhaps the three most senior Republicans who have not come out against Trump in this election cycle, Bush, Rice and Baker\u2019s lack of comment excites growing comment itself.\n\nBush\u2019s office recently said he would not endorse, having \u201cretired from presidential politics years ago\u201d, perhaps ensuring that his most lasting comment on his successor will be the one he reportedly delivered on the dais at the Capitol after Trump\u2019s inaugural speech in 2017, \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d and all: \u201cThat was some weird shit.\u201d\n\nRice did oppose Trump in 2016. Amid the Access Hollywood scandal, over Trump\u2019s boasts about sexual assault, Rice said he should withdraw as the Republican candidate, in favor of \u201csomeone who has the dignity and stature to run for the highest office in the greatest democracy on earth\u201d.\n\nShe has commented on Trump\u2019s presidency too. In 2021, she said his appeal to people who felt let down by establishment politicians was \u201csomething that we probably still really need to pay attention to\u201d. Earlier this year, Rice spoke out against isolationism, another central tenet of Trumpism. But that drew a rebuke from Adam Kinzinger, the former congressman from Illinois who sat with Cheney on the January 6 committee and who endorsed Harris at the Democratic national convention.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to speak up and do more,\u201d Kinzinger said. \u201cYou\u2019re not fighting against \u2018isolationism\u2019. You\u2019re fighting against Trump and you need to say this out loud. No more straddling the fence, Republicans. You\u2019re for Trump or against him. Pick a side.\u201d\n\nBaker has not taken a public position on Trump but in 2020, his biographers reported that though the \u201cmyriad ethical scandals surrounding Trump were head-spinning, Baker kept telling himself it was worth it to get conservative judges, tax cuts and deregulation\u201d.\n\n\u201cI will vote for the Republican,\u201d Baker was quoted as saying. \u201cI really will.\u201d\n\nNow 94 but still active in the public realm, Baker has not publicly indicated how he will vote this year. A source close to him said he had been sharply critical of Trump\u2019s attempt to overturn the election in 2020. Nonetheless, the former secretary of state\u2019s words in his biography ring loud.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t leave my party. You can say my party has left me because the leader of it has. But I think it\u2019s important, the big picture.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Thing Free daily newsletter Our US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Trump has incited a deadly attack on Congress; beaten a second impeachment arising from that attack; been convicted on 34 criminal charges with more than 50 pending; been ordered to pay hundreds of millions in civil cases regarding business fraud and a defamation suit arising from a rape allegation a judge called \u201csubstantially true\u201d; and launched an election campaign of breathtaking racist invective and lies.\n\n\u201cTaxes go up, taxes go down. Regulations are imposed, they are withdrawn. But a democracy? You can\u2019t squander that. Our reputation in the world, the Nato alliance at a time of extreme danger \u2013 once those things are gone, they would be exceptionally hard to rebuild.\u201d\n\nThat was the view of one Washington Republican, a White House official under both Bushes whose job now precludes public endorsements but who was granted anonymity to speak frankly and said they would vote for Harris.\n\nWith a laugh, the former official suggested George W Bush \u201cmay write in Condi Rice again\u201d, a reference to the protest vote Bush said he lodged in 2020, rather than support Joe Biden.\n\nAs for Baker, the former official said: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, he\u2019s from Houston. I think if you spend 50 years around Houston, you just absorb the oil and gas view of the world. Many people in the oil and gas industry are very anti-Biden, very anti-Harris, largely because of the perception that Biden was for the Green New Deal, which is false, and then the natural gas export review.\u201d\n\nFor Republicans, the former official said, it is easier to come out against Trump in the national security space and what might be called the democracy space, given the enormity of Trump\u2019s election subversion and January 6 and anxious questions about his relationships with autocrats including Vladimir Putin of Russia, Xi Jinping of China and Kim Jong-un of North Korea.\n\n\u201cThere are the Dick Cheneys of the world, who basically say: \u2018This is about democracy. This is about January 6. Donald Trump cannot be trusted with power.\u2019 I would also suspect that in Cheney\u2019s case, this goes back to his tenure in the defense department [under George HW Bush], and if you recall the op-ed that all the living secretaries of defense wrote on 3 January 2021, it\u2019s all coming out of that.\u201d\n\nThat column, for the Washington Post, urged all Americans to ensure a peaceful transfer of power. Three days later, Trump ensured that did not happen.\n\nThe former official continued: \u201cWhile there have been a number of more moderate Republicans who have endorsed Harris, I do not see this as ideological. I see it as, principally, first stop Trump, then attempt to rebuild the party.\u201d\n\nSuch ambitions may also motivate establishment Republicans who have chosen to back Trump, among them the New Hampshire governor, Chris Sununu, and Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor who fought Trump in the primary. All may have eyes on a post-Trump world \u2013 either in 2024 if he loses or 2028 if he wins.\n\nIf so, the former White House official suggested, it may not prove a wise course.\n\n\u201cI think it would be hugely, hugely difficult to rebuild the party, largely because the Trumpers just have control of pretty much everything in the states, in the state parties.\n\n\u201cBut I think that is the task of a generation, and even more moderate figures are going to have to make nods in the direction of Trumpism for the foreseeable future.\u201d",

Republican says, \u2018that will be\u2026\u2019\nIf Donald Trump falls short in his bid to return to the White House as US President in 2024, he is unlikely to contest another election after four years, the Republican candidate said in an interview on Sunday. Responding to a question about his fourth re-election bid, Trump said he won't plan one if he loses the upcoming 5 November elections.\n\n\u201cNo, I don't.

Months ago, Biden stepped out of the US presidential polls amid concerns surrounding his health and cognitive abilities after his disastrous debate performance.\n\nDonald Trump's comments were significant because they cleared Trump's plan for his fourth bid in 2028. His comments also surprised many as he rarely admits the possibility he could legitimately lose an election.\n\nAlso Read | Kamala Harris to skip Al Smith dinner, a traditional event for major presidential candidates\n\nAccording to the AP, he normally insisted that he could lose the US Presidential polls only if there were widespread cheating, a false allegation he made in 2020 and preemptively made again during his 2024 presidential campaign.\n\nTrump's secret for good health: \u2018Proper Hamburgers\u2019 When Attkisson asked Trump about the secret for his good health, Trump responded, \u201cI try and eat properly.\u201d The answer sparked an incredulous reaction from Attkisson, who noted that Trump has become infamous for his fondness for hamburgers.",

        "text": "Muslim voters are split between Harris and Green Party nominee Stein, as war in Gaza influences their decision \u2013 Houston Public Media\nA majority of American Muslims have been voting for Democratic presidents since 2004, but their support for the blue party is cracking.\n\nDaisy Espinoza / Houston Public Media\n\nListen Audio Embed Popup\n\nAs the sun set behind the River Oaks Islamic Center, casting an orange glow in the sky, dozens of people gathered one September afternoon in the mosque's carpeted prayer room.\n\nColleen DeGuzman\n\nShoes were stacked high on shelves by the entrance, and inside, Muslims of all ages kneeled and prayed in unison for the day's Maghrib \u2013 Islam's sunset prayer. Once they finished and the sky darkened, Aalia Qazi hung out in the center's common space, where chatter and laughter filled the air.\n\nQazi has been attending the central Houston center for years, and this November will be her second time voting in a presidential election.\n\nShe had contemplated skipping, believing neither presidential candidate from the major parties represented her faith. But with so much at stake in the Israel-Hamas war, Qazi wants a candidate who will work toward a ceasefire there.\n\n\"I feel like if I don\u2019t, my vote is going to be wasted,\" Qazi, 23, said. \"I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to vote for Biden or Kamala or Trump. I think I might vote for Jill Stein.\"\n\nDr. Jill Stein, a third-party candidate for the Green Party, may have garnered enough Muslim-American support to break the community's two-decade streak of backing Democratic presidential candidates. Israel's war in Gaza is motivating some Muslims to seek alternatives which would be a major shift since 2000 when a majority of them voted for George W. Bush.\n\nA national poll by the Council on American Islamic Relations, or CAIR, in August, found that a third of American Muslims plan to vote for Stein while another third support Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee. Meanwhile, 10% back former president Donald Trump.\n\nThe Muslim vote hasn't been divided in decades. They're also largely undecided; the poll also found that nearly a fifth, just weeks away from Election Day, don't know who they're going to vote for yet.\n\n\"I think there is continued increasing disappointment with President Biden's handling of the Gaza situation and his relationship with Netanyahu,\" said Amatullah Contractor, a senior advisor for the Texas team of Emgage Action, an organization that encourages Muslim Americans to vote.\n\nColleen Deguzman\n\nThe Houston region is home to the state's largest Muslim population according to Will White, director of CAIR's Houston chapter. He estimates that nearly half a million Muslims live in the Houston-Woodlands-Sugar Land metro area.\n\n\"We have over 200 Islamic centers and prayer spaces across the city, spanning all the way from Huntsville down to Galveston, and from Beaumont all the way to Sealy,\" White said\n\nThat would make Houston the most concentrated area of Muslims in the southern United States, which is why White says the opinions of Muslims in Houston are a good bellwether for those across the country.\n\n\"There is a huge variation on how the Muslim community is feeling nationwide,\" said White. \"Locally, I think we'll see that same variation.\"\n\nBoth White and Contractor agree that faith plays a central role in Muslims' shift away from Democrats and their split in support among multiple candidates this year. In 2020, 86% of Muslims voted for Biden, according to an Emgage poll, largely because they disapproved of former President Donald Trump.\n\n\"Civil rights and human rights are such a big part of the Islamic faith,\" said Contractor.\n\nEmgage created the Million Muslim Voters campaign which helped turn out more than one million voters in 2020, and plans to register 2 million for 2024.\n\nThis year, many are voting again with their faith.\n\n\"Islam has always taught us to hyper-fixate on peace, to fight discrimination at whatever level we can,\" said Shayan Sajid of Sugar Land.\n\nSajid attends and volunteers at Maryam Islamic Center, and he feels strongly about the war.\n\n\"This time our main concern, our main priority \u2014 our hearts, our brains, our everything \u2014 is towards what's going on in Gaza and the genocide,\" said Sajid, 24.\n\nThe Maryam Islamic Center in Sugar Land, where Shayan Sajid has been attending and volunteering for years.

Hamas is the armed Palestinian group that killed over 1,200 Israelis on October 7, 2023, and continues to hold many hostages.\n\nSince then, 40,000 Palestinians have been killed by the Israeli military according to the Gaza health ministry.\n\n\"At least I won't have the guilty conscience of voting for people who support genocide,\" Qazi said, later adding \"I don't want to vote for Trump and I don't want to vote for Kamala. If I had to decide between both of them, it would probably be Trump just because of how terrible the genocide has been under the Democratic Party and how hypocritical Kamala Harris has been in all of her statements.\"\n\nHarris has called for a ceasefire. Stein, however, has found momentum among Muslim voters because she has called the war a genocide.\n\nOther key issues important to Muslim voters may continue to align with mainstream Democratic talking points, according to Pew Research.\n\nContractor with Emgage Action said \"access to healthcare, as well as immigration\" along with \"gun violence prevention, are all sort of things that weigh top of mind for Muslim voters.\"\n\nBut the war in Gaza is an issue some aren't willing to compromise on.\n\n\"I think this time more than ever, this election more than ever, neither side is good enough \u2013 not even near,\" Sajid said.\n\nSajid, like Qazi and White, hasn't decided who will get his vote in November \u2014 but knows that he will cast a ballot.\n\nIt's not a stretch to say winning voters like him could decide the election. Muslim voters may have given the margin of victory to Biden in swing states such as Georgia and Pennsylvania.\n\nWhite said American Muslims have a difficult decision to make in November, but more than anything, he wants the community to vote.\n\n\"I don't care how they vote, I don't care who they vote for. I don't care what party they vote for \u2014 I just want them to vote.\"\n\nElection day is November 5.",

        "text": "Presidential election in Venezuela: The Western dilemma\nNot recognizing Nicolas Maduro's victory in the July 28 presidential election \u2013 and yet not declaring the opposition candidate, Edmundo Gonzalez, president-elect: This is the difficult balancing act that most Western countries are facing during Venezuela's post-election crisis.\n\nOn Thursday, September 19, the European Parliament voted in favor of a non-binding resolution proposed by the right and far right that recognizes Gonzalez as the country's \"legitimate and democratically elected president.\" So far, no European country has taken that step. Although Spain's two legislative chambers have also passed a resolution to this effect, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has not followed suit.\n\nApart from some 40 countries in the Americas, Asia and Africa \u2013 led by Russia and China, which, conversely, hailed Maduro as the winner of the election \u2013 the majority of countries in the rest of the international community, led by the US, have recognized the \"overwhelming evidence\" of Gonzalez's victory at the ballot box. But, apart from Argentina and Panama, no government is using the term \"president-elect.\" Gonzalez has been in exile in Madrid since September 8.\n\nRead more Venezuela's opposition candidate flees to Spain\n\nStatements from the Council of the EU merely say that \"official voting records (...) published by the opposition\" indicate that \" Gonzalez Urrutia would appear to be the winner of the presidential election by a significant majority.\" In early August, Washington made it clear that acknowledging his victory did not mean recognizing him as the president-elect. In fact, on Thursday, the European Parliament rejected a clause that would have required the EU and its member countries to do so.\n\nThe difference is subtle, but significant. It would have meant, starting on January 10, the day of the inauguration, forging diplomatic, political and commercial ties with a government in exile. \"Hardly anyone in Europe wants to do this, because they don't want to make the same mistake as with Juan Guaido,\" explained a senior Spanish diplomat.\n\nRead more Subscribers only Protests over Maduro's claimed victory spread to Venezuela's streets\n\n\"Enormous pressure\"\n\nIn January 2019, after Maduro was sworn in for a second term (following another contested re-election), the opposition declared a \"power vacuum\" and proclaimed the then-head of the National Assembly, Guaido, \"interim president.\" Barely 10 minutes later, the then-US president, Donald Trump, announced that he recognized the young deputy as the legitimate president. Emmanuel Macron and some 60 other leaders, including those from other European countries, followed suit.\n\nYou have 52.93% of this article left to read. The rest is for subscribers only.",

        "text": "State Sen. Mike McDonnell deflates GOP hopes for Nebraska winner-take-all in 2024 \u2022 Nebraska Examiner\nLINCOLN \u2014 The Republican push to change how Nebraska awards its Electoral College votes and boost former President Donald Trump ran into political reality Monday as a key lawmaker, State Sen. Mike McDonnell, announced he won\u2019t support the change.\n\nMcDonnell, of Omaha, said he had heard from people passionate about the issue who live in the Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District. But he said he did not hear enough to move him off his original position against the switch.\n\n\u201cElections should be an opportunity for all voters to be heard, no matter who they are, where they live, or what party they support,\u201d McDonnell said in a statement. \u201cI have taken time to listen carefully to Nebraskans and national leaders on both sides of the issue. After deep consideration, it is clear to me that right now, 43 days from Election Day, is not the moment to make this change.\u201d\n\nMcDonnell said he told Gov. Jim Pillen his stance and suggested that the Legislature put winner-take-all to a vote of the people, as a proposed constitutional amendment, so people can decide the issue \u201conce and for all.\u201d\n\nNebraska and Maine are the only states that award a single Electoral College vote to the winner in each congressional district, plus two votes to the statewide winner of the presidential popular vote. Nebraska has split off votes twice in four presidential elections.\n\nPresident Joe Biden won the 2nd District in 2020. Trump won all five of the state\u2019s electoral votes in 2016. Mitt Romney did the same in 2012. The 2nd District got its national name as \u201cthe blue dot\u201d in 2008, when former President Barack Obama won it.\n\n2nd District split\n\nNebraska Republicans have argued for years that Nebraska should award all five of its electoral votes to the statewide winner of the presidential popular vote, a process many call winner-take-all.\n\nRepublicans hold a 2-to-1 voter registration advantage over Democrats statewide, but the 2nd District cuts much more evenly between Republicans, Democrats and registered nonpartisans, a split that makes the 2nd District competitive in national elections.\n\nPillen had pledged to call a special session if he could secure the 33 votes needed to overcome a filibuster to change to winner-take-all. All five of Nebraska\u2019s GOP congressional delegates wrote a letter urging state lawmakers to pass such a move.\n\nThe Nebraska Legislature has 33 Republicans, 15 Democrats and one progressive who is a registered nonpartisan. People whipping votes for Pillen and the Trump campaign have told others they expected the remaining GOP holdouts to join the push for the change if McDonnell did.\n\nPillen\u2019s office had no immediate comment Monday, nor did the Trump or Harris campaigns.\n\nTrump weighed in Monday on Truth Social, his social media site thanking Pillen for trying. Trump lashed out at McDonnell as a \u201cDemocrat turned Republican(?),\u201d saying McDonnell stood in the way of a \u201cgreat, Republican common sense victory.\u201d\n\n\u201cI LOVE OMAHA, and won it in 2016. Looks like I\u2019ll have to do it again!!!\u201d\n\nMcDonnell\u2019s no on winner-take-all leaves Republicans in Nebraska\u2019s officially nonpartisan Legislature with no path to overcoming a promised filibuster unless a Democrat or nonpartisan senator defects. Thus far, none has opposed the status quo. Nebraska Democrats tweeted the list of 17 pledged no votes, including McDonnell.\n\nPart of the GOP urgency is wrapped in national polling that shows a close race between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee. Some political observers have argued the 2nd District could break a 269-269 Electoral College tie.\n\nFew Democrats were surprised that the fate of winner-take-all largely swung on McDonnell, a former Omaha fire union president who switched to the GOP this spring after facing political pushback from Democrats for backing abortion restrictions and legislation restricting some health care for minors who are transgender.\n\nSeveral said the abortion debate should have shown Republicans that McDonnell is largely immovable once he has made a controversial position clear. McDonnell said when he switched parties that he would not support winner-take-all. Others said he did what helped him most politically.\n\nMcDonnell\u2019s stance softened in recent weeks under pressure from local, state and national Republicans, including some with ties to the Trump campaign. He was one of two dozen GOP state senators who met Sept. 18 with Pillen and U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.\n\nBoth sides heard from\n\nPeople in the room said McDonnell told GOP colleagues last week he was looking for a way to get to yes. McDonnell told the Examiner on Thursday, not long after the meeting discussion became public, that he remained a no on winner-take-all, \u201cas of today.\u201d\n\nHe kept meeting and talking with people on both sides of the issue, including people tied to Trump, after that statement. He also heard from national and local Democrats tied to Harris.\n\nBut on Monday, McDonnell seemed to want to put the issue to rest. And with it, he may have secured one more election where a small slice of Nebraska will matter to both presidential campaigns.\n\nU.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., said he was \u201cincredibly disappointed by Senator McDonnell\u2019s opposition\u201d to winner-take-all. Ricketts said Nebraskans should speak as one in the Electoral College and \u201celect a president for all Nebraskans.\u201d\n\nState Sen. Rob Dover, a Republican representing the Norfolk area, also expressed disappointment in McDonnell\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cThere is too much at stake in this election for Nebraskans to spare an electoral vote,\u201d Dover said in a statement. \u201cWe should speak as a unified voice.\u201d\n\nState Sen. Loren Lippincott, a Republican from Central City, said he has spoken with the Governor\u2019s Office and they are now doubtful they would call a special session this year on winner-take-all. McDonnell\u2019s vote was key, he said.\n\n\u201cThat kind of closes the casket,\u201d Lippincott said of his fellow senator\u2019s announcement. \u201cWith Mike McDonnell being an absolute no, that kind of closes the lid. We\u2019re going to have to reintroduce this bill in the next session.\u201d\n\nBoth Trump and Harris have campaign staff in Nebraska, and both have sent surrogates to campaign here. Harris\u2019 running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Nebraska native, held a rally here. Trump\u2019s running mate, Ohio U.S. Sen. J.D. Vance, came to Nebraska to fundraise and meet with local Republicans.\n\nFor McDonnell, the calculus could be partly political. He has openly flirted with running for mayor of Omaha as early as 2025. His likely opponent, Republican incumbent Jean Stothert, has said she supports the switch to winner-take-all.\n\nStatewide support leans toward winner-take-all, but polling over several years indicates broad, bipartisan support in the 2nd District for keeping the state\u2019s unusual system, which brings attention and money to the Omaha area.\n\nMcDonnell\u2019s statement acknowledged the impact on the district.\n\n\u201cFor Omaha \u2026 it brings tremendous national attention, is impactful on our local economy and forces Presidential candidates to make their case to all Nebraskans, instead of just flying over and disregarding us,\u201d he said.\n\nPraised for \u2018standing strong\u2019\n\nJane Kleeb, chair of the Nebraska Democratic Party, praised McDonnell for \u201cstanding strong against tremendous pressure from out-of-state interests to protect Nebraskans\u2019 voice in our democracy.\u201d\n\n\u201cNebraska has a long and proud tradition of independence, and our electoral system reflects that by ensuring that the outcome of our elections truly represents the will of the people without interference,\u201d Kleeb said.\n\nKleeb also said the party would support leaders \u201cwho stand up for the people,\u201d which some interpreted as a hint that the door might be cracked open for McDonnell to return or to secure some form of support from the party if he runs for office in the future.\n\nThe Nebraska Republican Party had no immediate comment.",

        "text": "Republican activists say little sign of door-knocking for Trump in swing states\nLANSING, Mich. (AP) \u2014 Republican activists in swing states say they have seen little sign of the teams tasked with knocking on doors and turning out infrequent voters on behalf of Donald Trump, raising concerns about the party\u2019s presidential nominee relying on outside groups for an important part of his campaign operations.\n\nTrump and the Republican National Committee he controls opted to share get-out-the-vote duties in key parts of the most competitive states this year with groups such as America PAC, the organization supported by billionaire Elon Musk.\n\nWATCH: Trump speaks at rally in North Carolina in a return to battleground state\n\nIt is difficult to demonstrate that something is not happening. But with fewer than 50 days until the Nov. 5 election, dozens of Republican officials, activists and operatives in Michigan, North Carolina and other battleground states say they have rarely or never witnessed the group\u2019s canvassers. In Arizona and Nevada, the Musk-backed political action committee replaced its door-knocking company just this past week.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen anybody,\u201d said Nate Wilkowski, field director for the Republican Party in vote-rich Oakland County, Michigan, which includes crucial Detroit suburbs. He was speaking specifically of America PAC. \u201cNobody\u2019s given me a heads-up that they\u2019re around in Oakland County areas.\u201d\n\nTrump has relied on the loyalty of his fervent base, in an election expected to pivot on turnout. The spotty evidence, however, of what was portrayed as a sophisticated operation has some party activists questioning the operation\u2019s value. Trump\u2019s campaign views the race with Vice President Kamala Harris as a toss-up among likely voters but believes it has the edge among people who stayed away in 2016 and 2020, making it even more essential to reach them.\n\nThe work is particularly important in Michigan, where Trump lost by fewer than 160,000 votes in 2020, and where the GOP began the year mired in debt and fighting an ugly contest over the rightful state party leader.\n\nMichigan\u2019s Republican chairman, Pete Hoekstra, said he was told that America PAC canvassers had arrived in late August and were at work. A spokesperson for the PAC said canvassers were in Michigan, as well as Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2014 the seven most competitive states. The spokesperson declined to say how many canvassers there were across the states.\n\nMeghan Reckling, a Republican canvassing firm owner in Michigan, said she spotted two America PAC canvassers Tuesday in Oakland County. Identifiable in blue polo shirts emblazoned with \u201cAmerica,\u201d they were working an area that Reckling\u2019s own data showed to be one with low-propensity voters, she said.\n\n\u201cThey had, you could tell, a very pleasant exchange with the lady who answered the door, and probably talked to her for five minutes,\u201d Reckling said. \u201cFrom what I observed, they were obviously engaging in direct conversations.\u201d\n\nBut in interviews with more than two dozen activists and party officials across the seven battleground states, such reports were rare.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what the PACs are doing,\u201d said Mark Forton, the GOP chair in Macomb County, Michigan, a populous, suburban area northeast of Detroit. \u201cI don\u2019t know if they are going door to door.\u201d\n\nTrump aides say the campaign has an estimated 30,000 volunteer captains who are identifying less likely voters at the local level, including through neighborhood canvassing.\n\nCampaign political director James Blair also estimates that close to 2,500 paid canvassers, with America PAC making up a significant chunk, are working in the seven states. The PAC has paid canvassing firms more than $14 million since mid-August for work on the presidential campaign, according to Federal Election Commission spending reports filed by the group.\n\nBlair dismissed the statement that the campaign was ceding work to outside groups. Instead, he said, the campaign was making use of \u201cthe resources within those groups to bolster the frequency of contacts and the total coverage within the universe of where we would want them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe very much are focused on low-propensity voters, because it\u2019s what makes strategically the most sense in terms of how the president is going to win these states, and these groups\u2019 efforts have helped reach them,\u201d Blair said.\n\nAmerica PAC is run by former top aides to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019 failed presidential campaign. Trump\u2019s team also is sharing the responsibility of reaching less-frequent voters with groups that include Turning Point USA, led by conservative millennial personality Charlie Kirk, and the Faith and Freedom Coalition, headed by Christian conservative figure Ralph Reed.\n\nPart of the reason for the campaign\u2019s move was the result of an FEC ruling this year that a candidate\u2019s campaign and outside groups could coordinate their canvassing efforts with super PACs, and specifically share voter lists and data that they collect door to door. It means campaigns could share much of their labor- and cost-heavy ground efforts with groups that can take unlimited donations.\n\nHarris\u2019 outreach on the ground in the seven states is being led by campaign-paid staff, a number the campaign puts at nearly 2,200 in more than 328 offices. Campaign aides said groups affiliated with labor organizations were canvassing independent of the campaign.\n\nThe vast majority of what outside groups that support Harris are doing is advertising. Based on ad reservations for Harris and the leading super PAC supporting her, they are on track to spend nearly $175 million more than Trump\u2019s campaign and the leading super PACs supporting him by Election Day. Harris\u2019 campaign has outspent Trump\u2019s on advertising by 2-to-1 since she entered the race on July 23, according to the media tracking firm AdImpact.\n\nOver the past week, there were complications for America PAC, the most high-profile of the groups helping Trump in 2024.\n\nAmerica PAC fired Nevada-based canvassing company September Group, according to two people familiar with the matter. America PAC had paid the company almost $2.7 million a month ago, according to FEC reports. The people familiar with September Group\u2019s dismissal spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private business decisions.\n\nA spokesman for America PAC declined to confirm the move.\n\nTrump is not the first candidate to delegate some typical campaign-managed duties to outside groups. But the arrangement has not gone smoothly for some of the others who have tried it.\n\nLast year, DeSantis entrusted much of the political outreach for his Republican presidential campaign to a super PAC called Never Back Down, with conflict between its board and top campaign personnel late in the lead-up to the Iowa caucuses. Despite starting the campaign with roughly $100 million, DeSantis dropped out after losing the first contest in Iowa.\n\nIn his unsuccessful quest for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush attempted something very similar, ceding much of the political infrastructure work to a super PAC called Right to Rise, which raised more than $114 million in 2015.\n\nBeaumont reported from Des Moines, Iowa.

        "text": "Misinformation About Immigrants in the 2024 Presidential Election\nAs part of KFF\u2019s ongoing effort to identify and track misinformation in the U.S., the latest KFF Health Misinformation Tracking Poll examines claims about immigrants that have circulated during the 2024 presidential election cycle. While immigration has been a frequent topic of the campaign, the political discourse surrounding immigrants often overlooks the perspectives and experiences of immigrants themselves. To address this gap, this report includes new insights from a survey of immigrants in addition to views among the general public. This research builds on the 2023 KFF/LA Times Survey of Immigrants, which found that large shares of immigrants are confused and fearful about using government benefit programs. A companion issue brief provides key facts about immigrants\u2019 health care use and costs.\n\nKey takeaways from this report include:\n\nMost of the public has heard or read claims \u2013 including false claims \u2013 about immigrants from elected officials or candidates as part of the campaign. Conducted before the September 10 presidential debate, the survey found that large majorities of adults across partisans say they have heard false statements from candidates and elected officials that immigrants are \u201ccausing an increase in violent crime in the U.S.\u201d (80%) and that \u201cimmigrants are taking jobs and causing an increase in unemployment for people born in the U.S.\u201d (74%). A majority of adults (69%) also report hearing the true claim from candidates and elected officials that \u201cimmigrants help fill labor shortages in certain industries like agriculture, construction, or health care,\u201d though far fewer (31%) report hearing the true claim that \u201cundocumented immigrants pay billions of dollars in U.S. taxes each year.\u201d\n\nConducted before the September 10 presidential debate, the survey found that large majorities of adults across partisans say they have heard false statements from candidates and elected officials that immigrants are \u201ccausing an increase in violent crime in the U.S.\u201d (80%) and that \u201cimmigrants are taking jobs and causing an increase in unemployment for people born in the U.S.\u201d (74%). A majority of adults (69%) also report hearing the true claim from candidates and elected officials that \u201cimmigrants help fill labor shortages in certain industries like agriculture, construction, or health care,\u201d though far fewer (31%) report hearing the true claim that \u201cundocumented immigrants pay billions of dollars in U.S. taxes each year.\u201d When it comes to the truthfulness of these claims about immigrants, a majority of adults are in the \u201cmuddled middle,\u201d saying the claims are either \u201cprobably true\u201d or \u201cprobably false.\u201d For example, more than half (56%) of adults overall say the false claim that \u201cimmigrants are causing an increase in violent crime in the U.S.\u201d is either \u201cprobably true\u201d (28%) or \u201cprobably false\u201d (28%), while about one in five each say this claim is \u201cdefinitely true\u201d (23%) or \u201cdefinitely false\u201d (20%).\n\nFor example, more than half (56%) of adults overall say the false claim that \u201cimmigrants are causing an increase in violent crime in the U.S.\u201d is either \u201cprobably true\u201d (28%) or \u201cprobably false\u201d (28%), while about one in five each say this claim is \u201cdefinitely true\u201d (23%) or \u201cdefinitely false\u201d (20%). Despite many adults falling in the \u201cmuddled middle,\u201d there are strong partisan divides in the public\u2019s perceptions of the truthfulness of these claims, with Republicans more likely than Democrats to say false claims about immigrants are \u201cdefinitely true.\u201d For example, about four in ten (45%) Republicans say it is \u201cdefinitely true\u201d that immigrants are causing an increase in violent crime in the U.S., whereas a similar share (39%) of Democrats say this claim is \u201cdefinitely false.\u201d Conversely, Democrats are more likely than Republicans to say each of the true claims about immigrants is \u201cdefinitely true.\u201d\n\nFor example, about four in ten (45%) Republicans say it is \u201cdefinitely true\u201d that immigrants are causing an increase in violent crime in the U.S., whereas a similar share (39%) of Democrats say this claim is \u201cdefinitely false.\u201d Conversely, Democrats are more likely than Republicans to say each of the true claims about immigrants is \u201cdefinitely true.\u201d Amid former President Trump\u2019s false claims that undocumented immigrants drain federal benefit programs and receive free government health care, many U.S. adults, as well as immigrants themselves, are confused about whether and when immigrants can qualify for programs like these . Across partisanship and immigration status, about half or more U.S. adults and immigrant adults say they are either unsure or incorrectly believe that most immigrants to the U.S. are eligible to enroll in federal health insurance programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, as soon as they arrive in the U.S. Under longstanding federal policy, most lawfully present immigrants, with some exceptions, are generally ineligible to enroll in federal benefit programs like Medicaid until they have resided in the U.S. for at least five years. Undocumented immigrants are ineligible for federally funded health insurance programs.\n\n. Across partisanship and immigration status, about half or more U.S. adults and immigrant adults say they are either unsure or incorrectly believe that most immigrants to the U.S. are eligible to enroll in federal health insurance programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, as soon as they arrive in the U.S. Under longstanding federal policy, most lawfully present immigrants, with some exceptions, are generally ineligible to enroll in federal benefit programs like Medicaid until they have resided in the U.S. for at least five years. Undocumented immigrants are ineligible for federally funded health insurance programs. Nearly four in ten (36%) immigrant adults say the way former President Trump has talked about immigrants in his campaign has had a negative effect on how they are treated as immigrants in the U.S., rising to 45% among Asian immigrant adults. Those who say they have been negatively affected by Trump\u2019s rhetoric point to his role in instigating violence, racism, and discrimination toward immigrants. Most (72%) immigrants say that the way Vice President Harris has spoken about immigrants in her campaign has not affected how they are treated, yet perhaps in a nod to her heritage, three in ten (30%) Asian immigrant adults say the way Harris speaks about immigrants has had a positive effect on how they are treated.\n\nThose who say they have been negatively affected by Trump\u2019s rhetoric point to his role in instigating violence, racism, and discrimination toward immigrants. Most (72%) immigrants say that the way Vice President Harris has spoken about immigrants in her campaign has not affected how they are treated, yet perhaps in a nod to her heritage, three in ten (30%) Asian immigrant adults say the way Harris speaks about immigrants has had a positive effect on how they are treated. More than twice as many immigrant adults say that immigrants will be better off under a Harris (55%) presidency than a Trump presidency (19%), but about one quarter (26%) say who the president is makes no difference in the lives of immigrants. About seven in ten (73%) immigrants who identify as Democrats or lean towards the Democratic party say immigrants will be better off under Harris while nearly half (46%) of Republicans and Republican-leaning immigrants say the same about Trump.\n\nAbout seven in ten (73%) immigrants who identify as Democrats or lean towards the Democratic party say immigrants will be better off under Harris while nearly half (46%) of Republicans and Republican-leaning immigrants say the same about Trump. Similar to U.S. voters overall, immigrants who are citizens and registered to vote name the economy and inflation (39%) and threats to democracy (24%) as their top voting issues in this year\u2019s presidential election. About one in ten (9%) immigrant voters say immigration and border security is their top issue.\n\nThe Public\u2019s Exposure to and Belief in Claims About Immigrants\n\nImmigrants and immigration have been a central issue of the 2024 presidential campaign. The Trump campaign has repeatedly described immigrants as a source of crime, a burden for taxpayers, and a drain on government programs like Medicare and Social Security. The Harris campaign has also focused on immigration, emphasizing her tough on crime stance as a former attorney general of a border state, while also highlighting her family\u2019s immigrant roots. Fielded before the September 10 presidential debate, the latest KFF Health Misinformation Tracking Poll asked the public about true and false claims about immigrants that have circulated during the campaigns.\n\nFalse claims about immigrants are pervasive, with large majorities of adults saying they have heard or read statements from candidates or elected officials that \u201cimmigrants are causing an increase in violent crime in the U.S.\u201d (80%) and that \u201cimmigrants are taking jobs and causing an increase in unemployment for people born in the U.S.\u201d (74%). A majority of adults (69%) also report hearing the true claim from candidates or elected officials that \u201cimmigrants help fill labor shortages in certain industries like agriculture, construction, and health care,\u201d though far fewer (31%) report hearing that \u201cundocumented immigrants pay billions of dollars in U.S. taxes every year.\u201d The shares who report hearing or reading these claims are similar across partisans, but fewer Republicans than Democrats have heard the true claim about undocumented immigrants paying billions in taxes (23% vs. 38%).\n\n\n\nAs with other forms of misinformation, many adults are not certain what to believe when it comes to campaign-related statements about immigrants, with a majority falling in the \u201cmuddled middle,\u201d saying the claims are either \u201cprobably true\u201d or \u201cprobably false.\u201d Overall, more than half (56%) of adults say the false claim that \u201cimmigrants are causing an increase in violent crime in the U.S.\u201d is either \u201cprobably true\u201d (28%) or \u201cprobably false\u201d (28%). A similar pattern exists on the false claim about immigrants causing an increase in unemployment for U.S.-born workers (27% \u201cprobably true,\u201d 30% \u201cprobably false\u201d) and the true claim that undocumented immigrants pay billions of dollars in U.S. taxes (27% \u201cprobably true,\u201d 32% \u201cprobably false\u201d). For the true claim about immigrants filling labor shortages in key industries, overall, about half of adults fall in the middle, but more adults are inclined to say it is \u201cprobably true\u201d (44%) than \u201cprobably false\u201d (11%).\n\nPublic perceptions of the truthfulness of these claims are sharply divided along partisan lines, with Republicans more likely than Democrats to believe false assertions that immigrants are causing increases in violent crime and unemployment. About four in ten (45%) Republicans say the false claim about immigrants and violent crime is \u201cdefinitely true,\u201d whereas a similar share (39%) of Democrats says this claim is \u201cdefinitely false.\u201d There is also a wide partisan gap in perceptions of the false claim that immigrants are taking jobs and contributing to unemployment for U.S.-born adults, with about three in ten (31%) Republicans saying this is \u201cdefinitely true,\u201d while about four in ten (46%) Democrats say this is \u201cdefinitely false.\u201d\n\nPartisans also differ in their level of certainty about two true claims about immigrants. For example, sizeable shares of both Democrats and Republicans are inclined to believe the true claim that immigrants help fill labor shortages in certain industries, as at least three quarters from both parties say this claim is at least \u201cprobably true.\u201d However, Democrats are stronger than Republicans in this conviction, as a larger share say it is \u201cdefinitely true\u201d (55% vs. 21%). Few Democrats or Republicans are certain about the truthfulness of the true claim that \u201cundocumented immigrants pay billions of dollars in U.S. taxes every year,\u201d as at least half of adults from both parties say this statement is either \u201cprobably true\u201d or \u201cprobably false.\u201d Still, on this true claim, Republicans are more likely than Democrats to say it is \u201cdefinitely false\u201d (43% vs. 13%).\n\n\n\nKnowledge About Immigrants\u2019 Eligibility and Use of Federal Benefit Programs\n\nImmigrants and immigration are key talking points of former President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign as well as many other Republican candidates and elected officials. He and others have frequently made false statements about immigrants, including that undocumented immigrants are receiving free health care from the federal government, immigrants are \u201ckilling\u201d Social Security and Medicare, and that immigrants receive an outsized share of government benefits. The latest KFF Health Misinformation Tracking Poll asks both the general public as well as immigrants themselves their knowledge on immigrants\u2019 eligibility and use of federal benefits.\n\nAbout half of U.S. adults overall (51%) and immigrant adults (49%) incorrectly believe undocumented immigrants are eligible for health insurance programs paid for by the federal government or say they are \u201cnot sure.\u201d About three in ten adults overall (29%) and immigrant adults (32%) say they are \u201cnot sure\u201d whether undocumented immigrants are eligible for health insurance paid for by the federal government and about one in five of each group (21%, 17%) incorrectly say undocumented immigrants are eligible. The other half of U.S. adults (49%) and immigrant adults (51%) correctly say undocumented immigrants are not eligible for federal health insurance programs. Among U.S. adults overall, Republicans are more likely than Democrats to incorrectly believe undocumented immigrants are eligible for federal health insurance programs (30% vs. 18%). Under federal policy, undocumented immigrants are ineligible to enroll in federal health insurance programs like Medicare, Medicaid, or CHIP, or to purchase coverage through the ACA Marketplaces. As of June 2024, six states plus D.C. provide fully state-funded health insurance coverage to some income-eligible immigrant adults regardless of status. However, these programs are fully paid for by state funds.\n\nAbout half or more U.S. adults and immigrant adults either incorrectly believe most immigrants are eligible to receive benefits like Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security as soon as they arrive in the U.S. or say they are unsure. Under longstanding federal policy, most lawfully present immigrants, with some exceptions, are generally ineligible to enroll in federal benefit programs like Medicaid, until they have resided in the U.S. for at least five years (see KFF\u2019s companion issue brief on health care use among immigrants for more information). To qualify for Social Security and Medicare, lawfully present immigrants must meet all eligibility requirements, including work and age requirements, which preclude new immigrants from enrolling. About three in ten U.S. adults overall (31%) and one third of immigrant adults (32%) incorrectly believe most immigrants are eligible to receive benefits from Medicaid as soon as they arrive in the U.S., while at least a third of each group (33%, 38%) are unsure. There are similar levels of confusion over Medicare eligibility, with 58% of all U.S. adults and the same share of immigrant adults answering incorrectly or being unsure. About half of U.S. adults overall (53%) and immigrant adults (45%) correctly say immigrants are not eligible for Social Security benefits as soon as they arrive in the U.S., though about half in each group either answer incorrectly or are unsure. Overall, similar shares of U.S. adults and immigrants are confused about immigrants\u2019 eligibility for these federal benefits regardless of their partisanship or citizenship status, respectively, but a higher percentage of U.S. adults who are Republican mistakenly believe immigrants are immediately eligible for Medicaid compared with Democrats (40% vs. 31%).\n\nMost (59%) U.S. adults incorrectly believe that on average, immigrants receive more in government benefits than they pay in taxes, while most (66%) immigrant adults correctly say the opposite: that immigrants pay more in taxes than they receive in government benefits. Among both U.S. adults overall and immigrant adults, there are stark differences by partisanship on this question. About eight in ten (84%) Republican U.S. adults incorrectly believe immigrants receive more in government benefits on average than they pay in taxes, whereas a majority (61%) of Democrats correctly say the opposite. Among immigrant adults, most partisans correctly answer that immigrants pay more in taxes than they receive in government benefits, but Democrats and Democratic-leaning immigrants are more likely than Republicans and Republican-leaners to answer correctly (71% vs. 58%). Perhaps in a reflection of their own ineligibility for many government benefits, about eight in ten (78%) immigrant adults who are non-citizens are aware that immigrants pay more in taxes than they receive in government benefits, while a smaller majority (57%) of immigrant citizens say the same. Analysis shows undocumented immigrants contribute billions in federal, state, and local taxes each year, helping to fund programs they cannot access, including Social Security and Medicare. Research further finds that immigrants pay more into the health care system through taxes and health insurance premiums than they utilize, helping to subsidize health care for U.S.-born citizens.\n\nHow Immigrants Have Been Affected by the Campaign\n\nNearly four in ten (36%) immigrant adults say the way former President Trump has talked about immigrants in his campaign has had a negative effect on how they are treated as immigrants in the U.S., rising to 45% among Asian immigrant adults. Overall, about half of (54%) immigrant adults say Trump\u2019s rhetoric about immigrants has not had an effect on how they are treated, while an additional one in ten (10%) say it has had a positive effect. There are no substantial differences in responses among immigrant adults by citizenship status nor by English proficiency in how they say Trump\u2019s immigrant rhetoric has affected them.\n\nIn Their Own Words: How Trump\u2019s Campaign Rhetoric Has Affected Immigrants In a few words, can you describe how the campaign has affected how you are treated? \u201cWith Trump people belittle me and think that we\u2019re thieves and rapists\u201d- 72-year-old Mexican immigrant woman in California \u201cI am looked at more suspiciously when I am out alone or with only other people of color. I do not feel safe out alone\u201d\u2014 50-year-old Taiwanese immigrant woman in California \u201cPeople usually tell me to go back to my country, to go back where I came from, to go back to Mexico even though that\u2019s not where I\u2019m from\u201d-27-year-old Dominican immigrant woman in Rhode Island \u201cIf you happen to speak Spanish (like at [the grocery store]) as my wife and I do, there are generally \u2018eye rolls\u2019 and \u2018staring\u2019 at us by primarily White folks\u201d-80-year-old Mexican immigrant man in Texas \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s rhetoric has demonized all immigrants and make them feel like second class citizens\u201d-41-year-old Chinese immigrant man in California\n\nMost (72%) immigrants report that Vice President Harris\u2019s campaign statements about immigrants have had no effect on how they are treated, but perhaps in a nod to her heritage, about three in ten (30%) Asian immigrant adults say her statements have had a positive effect. Overall, about one in five (21%) immigrant adults say they feel the way Harris has talked about immigrants in her campaign has positively affected the way they are treated as immigrants in the U.S., while far fewer (7%) say Harris\u2019s statements have had a negative effect on how they are treated.\n\nA majority of immigrant adults say that immigrants would be better off under a Harris (55%) presidency compared to a Trump presidency (19%), but about one quarter (26%) say who the president is makes no difference in the lives of immigrants. Immigrant partisans are divided on this question. About three quarters (73%) of immigrant Democrats and Democratic-leaners say immigrants will be better off under Harris, whereas about one in four (24%) Republicans and Republican-leaning immigrants say the same. While about four in ten (46%) of immigrants who are Republican or lean Republican say immigrants would be better off under Trump, about three in ten (29%) say it makes no difference who is president.\n\nImmigrant Voters\u2019 Priorities\n\nImmigrants who are citizens and registered to vote prioritize similar issues and are equally motivated to vote in the presidential election as U.S. voters overall. About half of immigrants to the U.S. are naturalized citizens and therefore eligible to vote in U.S. Among these voters, about half (53%) say they are more motivated to vote this year compared to previous presidential elections, similar to the share of all U.S. voters who say the same (59%).\n\nImmigrant voters also prioritize a similar list of issues as U.S. voters overall, with the economy and inflation (39%) and threats to democracy (24%) topping the list of issues these voters say are most important to their presidential vote. About one in ten (9%) citizen immigrant voters say immigration and border security is their top issue, followed by Medicare and Social Security (8%), abortion (5%), and the war in Gaza (5%). Partisan splits on these issues are also similar to U.S. voters overall, with a larger share of Republican and Republican-leaning immigrant voters compared to Democrats/Democratic-leaning immigrant voters prioritizing the economy and inflation (51% vs. 32%), and larger shares of Democrats vs. Republicans prioritizing threats to democracy (35% vs. 3%) and abortion (7% vs. 1%).",

        "text": "In Tight U.S. Presidential Race, Latino Voters\u2019 Preferences Mirror 2020\nFor Latino voters, the economy is the top issue, followed by health care, violent crime and gun policy\n\n(LPETTET and SDI Productions/Getty Images)\n\nHow we did this Pew Research Center conducted this analysis to understand Latino voters\u2019 views of the 2024 U.S. presidential election. For this analysis, we surveyed 9,720 U.S. adults \u2013 including 691 Latino registered voters \u2013 from Aug. 26 to Sept. 2, 2024, in English and Spanish. Everyone who took part in this survey is a member of the Center\u2019s American Trends Panel (ATP), a group of people recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses who have agreed to take surveys regularly. This kind of recruitment gives nearly all U.S. adults a chance of selection. Surveys were conducted either online or by telephone with a live interviewer. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other factors. Read more about the ATP\u2019s methodology. Here are the questions used for this report, the topline, and the survey methodology.\n\nAs the final leg of the presidential campaign begins following an eventful summer, a majority of Latino registered voters (57%) say they would vote for Vice President Kamala Harris and 39% would vote for former President Donald Trump, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted Aug. 26-Sept. 2, 2024.\n\nHarris performs substantially better among Latino voters than President Joe Biden did when he was the likely Democratic nominee. In July \u2013 after the first presidential debate but before Trump was injured in a shooting at a campaign rally \u2013 equal shares of Latino voters said they would vote for Biden as for Trump (36% each) while 24% favored Robert F. Kennedy Jr. In a two-way matchup, 51% of Latino voters said in July that they\u2019d support Biden and 46% said they\u2019d back Trump \u2013 a narrower margin for Biden than for Harris today.\n\nThe presidential preferences of Latinos look similar to 2020, when Biden defeated Trump 61% to 36% among Latinos who voted. (Jump to more about 2024 presidential preferences among demographic groups of Latino voters.)\n\nSupporters of both candidates have largely made up their minds. Among Latino registered voters, 79% of Harris supporters and 77% of Trump supporters say they are certain to vote for their candidate. By comparison, among all U.S. registered voters, at least eight-in-ten Harris and Trump supporters say they are certain to vote for their candidate.\n\nWhen it comes to their vote choice, Latino Harris and Trump backers give different reasons for their support.\n\n70% of Latinos who back Trump say their choice is more a vote for Trump than against Harris. This is a slightly bigger share than in October 2020, when 62% of Latino Trump supporters said their choice was a vote for Trump.\n\nBy contrast, Latinos backing Harris give mixed reasons for their vote choice: 54% say their vote is more a vote against Trump than for Harris, while 46% say it\u2019s a vote for Harris. Notably, this is similar to what Latino Biden supporters expressed in October 2020, when 59% said their vote was more of a vote against Trump.\n\nOn issues, 85% of Latino voters say the economy is very important to their vote in this year\u2019s presidential election, followed by health care (71%), violent crime (62%), gun policy (62%), immigration (59%) and Supreme Court appointments (58%).\n\nYet Latino voters who support Trump and Harris prioritize different issues. Among Trump\u2019s Latino supporters, the economy (93%), violent crime (73%) and immigration (71%) are the three most-cited issues important to their vote. By contrast, for Latinos who back Harris, the economy (80%), health care (78%) and gun policy (66%) are the three top issues. Notably, immigration was cited by 51% of Harris Latino voters as important for their vote for president \u2013 the second-lowest share among the 10 issues asked about in the survey. (Jump to more about what Latino voters see as top issues.)\n\nIn 2024, 36.2 million Latinos are eligible to vote (i.e., they are adult U.S. citizens), up 4 million since 2020 and more than double the 14.3 million Latino eligible voters in 2000. As a result, Latino voters are now the nation\u2019s second-largest group of eligible voters \u2013 ahead of Black voters and Asian American voters and behind White voters. With so many Latino eligible voters nationally, they make up notable shares of voters in several of this year\u2019s battleground states.\n\nPew Research Center\u2019s bilingual national survey of 9,720 adults (including 691 Latino registered voters), conducted from Aug. 26 to Sept. 2, 2024, explores views and attitudes about the presidential election since Biden withdrew from the race and Harris became the Democratic nominee. It was fielded prior to the Sept. 10 presidential debate.\n\nThis report explores the views of Latino registered voters about the 2024 presidential candidates and election.\n\nLatino voters and the Harris-Trump match up\n\nHarris has an advantage over Trump in just about all major demographic subgroups among Latino voters, though some notable differences exist.\n\nGender: Harris leads among both Hispanic women (58%) and men (55%). About four-in-ten Hispanic men (41%) and women (37%) say they would vote for Trump.\n\nHarris leads among both Hispanic women (58%) and men (55%). About four-in-ten Hispanic men (41%) and women (37%) say they would vote for Trump. Age: 59% of Latino voters under 50 support Harris while 35% say they support Trump. Among voters ages 50 and older, 52% support Harris and 45% support Trump, highlighting an age gap in support for both candidates.\n\n59% of Latino voters under 50 support Harris while 35% say they support Trump. Among voters ages 50 and older, 52% support Harris and 45% support Trump, highlighting an age gap in support for both candidates. Education: Harris leads across all education groups among Latino voters. Meanwhile, Trump support is about the same among each group.\n\nHarris leads across all education groups among Latino voters. Meanwhile, Trump support is about the same among each group. Economic conditions rating: Latino voters who rate economic conditions as only fair or poor are split between Harris (49%) and Trump (46%). Meanwhile, Harris has overwhelming support among Latino voters who rate economic conditions as excellent or good: 83% say they support Harris, while 17% say the same for Trump.\n\nLatino voters who rate economic conditions as only fair or poor are split between Harris (49%) and Trump (46%). Meanwhile, Harris has overwhelming support among Latino voters who rate economic conditions as excellent or good: 83% say they support Harris, while 17% say the same for Trump. Religion: 65% of Latino Protestants say they plan to vote for Trump, while Harris has majority support among Hispanic Catholics (65%) and religiously unaffiliated Hispanics (67%).\n\nRelated: White Protestants and Catholics support Trump, but voters in other U.S. religious groups prefer Harris\n\nTop issues for Latino Harris and Trump supporters in 2024\n\nWhen it comes to issues that are very important to their vote this year, 85% of Latino registered voters say the economy matters most among the 10 issues included in the survey. Following the economy are the issues of health care (71%), violent crime (62%), gun policy (62%) and immigration (59%).\n\nNonetheless, Latinos who back Harris and Trump prioritize issues differently:\n\nThe economy is the top issue for both Latino Trump and Harris supporters, but Latino Trump backers are more likely to say the economy is very important to their vote (93% vs. 80%).\n\nFor Latino Harris supporters, the most important issues after the economy are health care (78%), gun policy (66%), Supreme Court appointments (65%) and racial and ethnic inequality and climate change (61% each). Another 51% say immigration is very important to their vote this year, the second-lowest rated issue for Latino Harris supporters.\n\nFor Latino Trump supporters, the top issue after the economy is violent crime (73%), followed by immigration (71%), health care (62%), gun policy (55%) and foreign policy (54%).\n\nThe pattern of top issues for Latino Harris and Trump supporters in many ways mirrors that among all Harris and Trump supporters, though there are some differences.\n\nTrump supporters overall are just as likely as Latino Trump supporters to rate the economy as very important to their vote this year \u2013 93% in each group says this. On the issue of immigration, 82% of all Trump supporters say this is a very important issue for them while 71% of Latino Trump supporters say the same.\n\nAmong all Harris backers, the leading issues are health care (76%) and Supreme Court appointments (73%). Among Latino Harris supporters, the economy is the top issue, with a higher share saying this than among all Harris supporters (80% vs. 68%). On immigration, Latino Harris backers are more likely than all Harris backers to say the issue is very important to their vote (51% vs. 39%).\n\nWhen it comes to Latino voters\u2019 confidence in the candidates, Harris holds a significant advantage over Trump on most issues.\n\nAbortion: 62% of Latino registered voters say they have confidence that Harris can make good decisions about abortion policy; 39% say the same about Trump.\n\n62% of Latino registered voters say they have confidence that Harris can make good decisions about abortion policy; 39% say the same about Trump. Issues around race: 59% of Latino voters say they have confidence Harris can make good decisions on this topic while 37% say the same about Trump \u2013 a 22 percentage point advantage for Harris.\n\n59% of Latino voters say they have confidence Harris can make good decisions on this topic while 37% say the same about Trump \u2013 a 22 percentage point advantage for Harris. Supreme Court nominees: When it comes to selecting good nominees for the Supreme Court, 58% say they have confidence in Harris while 38% say the same about Trump.\n\nOn immigration policy, 54% of Latino voters say they have confidence in Harris to make wise decisions while 43% say the same about Trump \u2013 an 11-point edge for Harris. But among all registered voters, Trump has a 7-point lead: 52% say they are confident Trump can make wise decision about immigration policy, while 45% say the same about Harris.\n\nAnd on economic policy, Harris does not have a significant advantage over Trump among Latino voters. This contrasts with all registered voters, 55% of whom say they have confidence in Trump to make good decisions about economic policy while 45% say this about Harris \u2013 a 10- point advantage for Trump.\n\nLatino voters and national economic conditions\n\nEconomic issues have been top of mind for Latino voters in recent years.\n\n80% of Latino registered voters say they are very concerned about the price of food and consumer goods today.\n\n77% say they are very concerned about the cost of housing, up from 71% in 2022.\n\n46% say they are very concerned about people who want to work being able to find jobs, up from 36% in 2022.\n\nThe survey also finds that Latino registered voters are downbeat about the state of the U.S. economy. About three-quarters (77%) rate national economic conditions as only fair or poor. However, Latino Trump backers are more likely than Latino Harris backers to rate economic conditions this way (90% vs. 66%).\n\nLooking ahead to the next year, Latino voters express mixed views about future economic conditions. About four-in-ten (39%) expect better conditions, 22% expect worse conditions and 38% expect conditions to be the same as about now. Views are similarly mixed among both Latino Trump and Harris supporters.\n\nAbout twice as many Latino voters see Harris as even-tempered, a good role model and down-to-earth than say these traits describe Trump. Harris also has a wide advantage over Trump on all but one of the personal characteristics asked about in the survey.\n\n72% of Latino voters say \u201ceven-tempered\u201d describes Harris very or fairly well, while 30% say the same about Trump \u2013 a 42-point advantage for Harris.\n\n\n\n61% of Latino voters see Harris as \u201ca good role model,\u201d while 30% say the same about Trump.\n\n\n\n63% say \u201cdown-to-earth\u201d describes Harris very or fairly well; 33% of Latino voters say this about Trump.\n\n68% describe Harris as \u201cmentally sharp\u201d while 45% say the same about Trump \u2013 a 23-point advantage for Democratic candidate.\n\nHarris also leads Trump on being seen as \u201cwell-informed\u201d by Latino voters (63% vs. 45%). And more Latino voters say Harris \u201chas a good sense of humor\u201d than say this about Trump (59% vs. 48%).\n\nTrump does not hold an advantage over Harris on any personal characteristic we asked about. However, similar majorities of Latino voters say Harris and Trump stand up for what they believe in (65% vs. 62%).\n\nLatino voters say Harris and Trump make them feel a mix of positive and negative emotions.\n\nPride: 24% of Latino registered voters say Harris makes them feel extremely or very proud, while 19% say Trump makes them feel this way. Notably, 49% say Harris makes them feel not too or not at all proud, and 66% say this about Trump.\n\n24% of Latino registered voters say Harris makes them feel extremely or very proud, while 19% say Trump makes them feel this way.

Anger: 19% of Latino voters say Harris makes them feel extremely or very angry; 38% say Trump makes them feel this way.\n\nDoes Harris\u2019 and Trump\u2019s race and ethnicity, gender and age matter to Latino voters in the 2024 election?\n\nThis year\u2019s presidential election will produce a national historic first one way or the other. If Harris is elected, she would be the first woman, first Black woman and first Asian person to be serve as president. If Trump is elected, he would be the oldest president, at age 78.\n\nOverall, Latino voters have mixed views on how much these characteristics might help or hurt the candidates.\n\nKamala Harris\n\n36% say Harris\u2019 Asian and Black background will help her in November, 42% say it won\u2019t make much of a difference, and 21% say it will hurt her chances.\n\n35% say being a woman will help Harris\u2019 candidacy, 26% say it won\u2019t make much of a difference, and 38% say it will hurt.\n\n47% say Harris\u2019 age (59 years old) will help her in the election, while another 47% say her age won\u2019t make much of a difference.\n\nDonald Trump\n\n51% of Latino voters say being White will help Trump\u2019s candidacy, while only 8% say it will hurt. Another 41% say it won\u2019t make a difference in November.\n\nLatino voters are split on the impact of Trump\u2019s gender: 47% say being a man will help him, while an equal share say it won\u2019t make much of a difference. Very few say it will hurt him.\n\n45% say Trump\u2019s age (78 years old) will hurt his chances in November, while 49% say it won\u2019t make much of a difference.\n\nLatino voters and engagement with the 2024 presidential election\n\nLatino registered voters have been less engaged than other registered voters in this year\u2019s presidential election. Nonetheless, at this point in the election, Latinos who support Harris and Trump are about equally engaged.\n\nDoes it matter who wins?\n\n64% of Latino registered voters say it really matters who wins the election.\n\nLatinos who support Harris are slightly more likely than those who support Trump to say it really matters who wins (67% vs. 62%).\n\n43% of Latino registered voters say they are satisfied with the presidential candidates. This is up from 28% who said the same in July, before Biden exited the race. (At that time, 71% of Latino registered voters said they were not too or not at all satisfied with the presidential candidates.)\n\nSimilar shares of Latinos who support Harris and Trump say they are satisfied with the candidates running for president (46% vs. 43%).\n\n49% of Latino registered voters say they have given a lot of thought to the candidates who are running for president in 2024.\n\nAmong Latinos who support Harris, 48% say they have given a lot of thought to the presidential candidates, compared with 52% of those who support Trump.\n\nCLARIFICATION (September 25, 2024): In the third paragraph, the following sentence was updated to reflect the presidential preferences of Latino voters in 2020 due to a revised weighting approach we implemented in 2022: \u201cThe presidential preferences of Latinos look similar to 2020, when Biden defeated Trump 61% to 36% among Latinos who voted.\u201d For more information, see the methodology for our 2022 validated voters report.",

        "text": "2024 Election Environment Favorable to GOP\nWASHINGTON, D.C. -- Nearly all Gallup measures that have shown some relationship to past presidential election outcomes or that speak to current perceptions of the two major parties favor the Republican Party over the Democratic Party. Chief among these are Republican advantages in U.S. adults\u2019 party identification and leanings, the belief that the GOP rather than the Democratic Party is better able to handle the most important problem facing the country, Americans\u2019 dissatisfaction with the state of the nation, and negative evaluations of the economy with a Democratic administration in office.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nThe following is a review of these key measures in 2024, primarily from a Sept. 3-15 Gallup poll, compared with the same measures in past presidential election years.\n\nParty Identification and Leaning\n\nMore U.S. adults identify as Republican or say they lean toward the Republican Party (48%) than identify as or lean Democratic (45%). Those figures are based on an average of Gallup polls taken during the third quarter (July to September) to minimize poll-to-poll variation in party identification estimates and to provide more reliable comparisons across presidential years given the different timings of the two major party conventions in July, August or September.\n\nParty affiliation and voting are strongly predictive of individuals\u2019 vote choices, with the vast majority of identifiers and leaners voting for the candidate of their preferred party. At the aggregate level, there are typically more Democrats and Democratic leaners than Republicans and Republican leaners in the U.S. adult population. Democrats have won presidential elections in years in which they had larger-than-normal advantages in party affiliation, including 1992, 1996, 2008, 2012 and 2020.\n\nIn years when the advantage was narrower -- 2004 and 2016, for example -- Republicans won in the Electoral College if not also the popular vote.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nRepublicans previously have not had an outright advantage in party affiliation during the third quarter of a presidential election year, and they have rarely outnumbered Democrats in election and nonelection years over the past three decades.\n\nParty Performance on Issues\n\nThree separate measures of party performance on issues favor the Republican Party by at least a modest margin.\n\nBy 46% to 41%, Americans say the Republican Party is better able than the Democratic Party to address what they think is the most important problem facing the country. The top issues Americans currently name as the most important are ones that tend to favor the GOP, including the economy (24%), immigration (22%), the government (17%) and inflation (15%).\n\nThis measure has been highly predictive of election outcomes in Gallup trends dating back to 1948. The party rated as better at handling the most important problem has won all but three presidential elections since that year. The question was not asked in 2000, and the two parties tied in 1980, when inflation was the top issue. The only time the measure was out of sync with the outcome was in 1948, when Americans believed the Republican Party was better able to handle the most important problem (international issues) but returned Democratic incumbent Harry Truman to office.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nGallup also tracks perceptions of which party can best handle economic and international matters, broadly. Americans currently give the Republican Party a six-percentage-point edge, 50% to 44%, as the party they think would do a better job of keeping the country prosperous. Gallup has asked this question since 1951. In 16 presidential elections since then when one party has had at least a minimal advantage on this measure, that party has won 12 times. The exceptions were 1952, 1968, 1980 and 2000. The question was not asked in 2004, and the parties were tied in 1956.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nRepublicans hold a more substantial advantage of 14 points (54% to 40%) as the party Americans believe is better able to keep the nation safe from terrorism and other international threats. Republicans have led on this question all years it has been asked (dating back to 2002) except 2007 and 2012.\n\nGallup has a limited history of asking this question in presidential election years. The 14-point Republican lead this year is larger than in any previous presidential election year. The prior highs were seven points in 2008 (a year Republicans lost) and 2016 (a year Republicans won). In 2012 (when the parties were tied) and 2020 (when Republicans had a four-point advantage), the Democratic candidate won the presidential election.\n\nEconomic Confidence\n\nGallup\u2019s Economic Confidence Index is currently at -28, indicating Americans\u2019 attitudes about the economy are negative, on balance. The rating is derived from the 22% of Americans describing current economic conditions as \u201cexcellent\u201d or \u201cgood\u201d versus the 48% saying they are \u201cpoor,\u201d and the 32% believing the economy is \u201cgetting better\u201d versus the 62% saying it is \u201cgetting worse.\u201d\n\nIn incumbent election years, a -28 economic confidence score would be closer to what it has typically been in losing (1992, 2008, 2016) rather than winning (1996, 2004, 2012) years for the president\u2019s party. In 2020, Americans\u2019 evaluations were essentially neutral when Donald Trump lost, though other incumbent presidents won when there were similar levels of economic confidence.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nNational Satisfaction\n\nTwenty-two percent of Americans are satisfied with the way things are going in the United States at this time. Satisfaction levels this low have been associated with incumbent presidents losing their reelection bids in 1980 (19%), 1992 (22%) and 2020 (28%).\n\nIn election years when incumbents have not sought reelection, satisfaction has been less strongly related to the eventual outcome. The 1988 and 2008 elections followed the general pattern, with the president\u2019s party winning the former when the majority of Americans were satisfied and losing the latter with satisfaction near record lows. However, in 2000, Americans were highly satisfied, but the incumbent Democratic Party lost a close election in the Electoral College. The incumbent Democratic Party also lost the 2016 election (also in the Electoral College) with more middling levels of satisfaction.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nPresidential Job Approval\n\nPresident Joe Biden\u2019s decision to withdraw from the 2024 presidential race has moved presidential job approval from arguably the most important election indicator this year to one of secondary importance. At 39% job approval, Biden is well below the 48% threshold for past presidents who were reelected. The 2024 Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump, lost the 2020 election when 46% approved of the job he was doing as president.\n\nBiden\u2019s unpopularity could still affect the election to the extent voters transfer their frustrations with the Biden administration to Vice President Kamala Harris. For her part, 44% of U.S. adults approve of the job she is doing as vice president, down slightly from a 47% reading in August.\n\nIn presidential election years when the incumbent was not running for reelection, the opposition party won all but the 1988 election. These losses occurred whether the incumbent president was popular (1960, 2000 and 2016) or unpopular (1952, 1968 and 2008) at the time of the election. All of those elections, unlike the current one, came after the incumbent had been elected to serve a second term as president in the prior election.\n\nParty Favorable Ratings\n\nOne area where the Republican Party does not have an advantage over the Democratic Party this year is in party favorable ratings. The September Gallup poll finds 43% of Americans saying they have a favorable opinion of the Republican Party and 42% of the Democratic Party.\n\nIn many presidential election years, like now, the parties had similar favorable ratings. In the years in which one party had an advantage -- 1996, 2004, 2008, 2012 and 2016 -- the party with the higher favorable rating won all but one (2016).\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nPreference for Government Activity\n\nAmericans generally express a preference for a limited government role, the traditional Republican position, when they are asked whether the government is doing too many things that should be left to individuals and businesses (55%) or should do more to solve the country\u2019s problems (41%). Since opinions on this matter have been fairly consistent over time, they tend to have little relationship to election outcomes.\n\nHowever, it is notable that in 1992 and 2020, the only two election years when more Americans preferred an active government role, the Democratic Party candidate defeated a Republican incumbent.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nCongressional Job Approval\n\nAll seats in the House of Representatives and approximately one-third of U.S. Senate seats are up for election this year. Congress remains unpopular, with 20% approving and 75% disapproving of the job it is doing, which theoretically could make incumbent members of Congress vulnerable. To the extent Americans\u2019 frustrations with Congress influence their vote decision, it is unclear how those numbers will translate because the Republicans have a majority in the House of Representatives and Democrats are the majority party in the Senate.\n\nNevertheless, the current level of congressional approval is remarkably similar to what it has been in every congressional election cycle since 2008, ranging between 18% and 21%.\n\nDivided Government Preference\n\nAmericans have typically not held a clear preference for having a unified versus divided party government. The 41% who this year say having the same party control Congress and the presidency ties with 2020 as the highest in Gallup\u2019s trend. Thirty percent say it makes no difference whether the government is unified or divided, while 23% say having different parties control Congress and the presidency is preferable.\n\nAmericans have been slightly more likely to say that a unified government is better in presidential compared with non-presidential election years.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe political environment suggests the election is Trump\u2019s and Republicans\u2019 to lose. Nearly every indicator of the election context is favorable to the Republican Party, and those that aren\u2019t are essentially tied rather than showing a Democratic advantage. Nevertheless, the two major party presidential candidates have similar favorable ratings in Gallup\u2019s September poll, echoing presidential preference polls that suggest a neck-and-neck race between Trump and Harris.\n\nIt is possible that Americans\u2019 voter preferences may align better with their views of the state of the nation between now and Election Day. Trump led in most presidential preference polls this summer when Biden was the presumptive Democratic nominee and Americans\u2019 unhappiness was focused on the incumbent president. The election results will reveal the extent to which Harris, the incumbent vice president, is saddled with Americans\u2019 frustrations with the current administration or is able to rise above those.\n\nIt may be the case that Americans want to go in a different direction after previously voting against a second Trump term in 2020. If Trump were to lose, it suggests that concerns about his style, character, temperament, felony charges and convictions, and age outweigh Americans\u2019 anxieties about the state of the nation.\n\nTo stay up to date with the latest Gallup News insights and updates, follow us on X @Gallup.\n\nExplore President Biden's approval ratings and compare them with those of past presidents in the Gallup Presidential Job Approval Center.\n\nLearn more about how the Gallup Poll Social Series works.\n\nView complete question responses and trends (PDF download).\n\n###Embeddable###",

        "text": "AI, misinformation and the 2024 US presidential elections\nWith the 2024 US presidential elections around the corner, California Governor Gavin Newsom recently signed three new bills to tackle the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in creating misleading images and videos for political advertisements. The development comes at a time when there is widespread concern among Americans about AI\u2019s potential to spread misinformation during the upcoming elections.\n\nEarlier this month, singer Taylor Swift, who endorsed US Vice-President Kamala Harris on her Instagram account, wrote about the dangers of AI and how her fake images were created to \u2018falsely\u2019 endorse Donald Trump.\n\nX\u2019s AI chatbot Grok too has been in the limelight for pushing misinformation about elections and allowing users to make life-like AI-generated images (deepfakes) of elected officials in ethically questionable situations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA recent Pew Research Center survey found that around 57 per cent of respondents were worried about AI being used to create false information, but only 20 per cent trusted major tech companies to prevent its misuse. This unease is shared by Republicans and Democrats alike, though views on AI\u2019s impact vary by age group.\n\nhttps://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/09/19/concern-over-the-impact-of-ai-on-2024-presidential-campaign/\n\nThe survey found that over 39 per cent of Americans said AI would be used mostly for negative purposes during the presidential campaign. It also revealed that 57 per cent of US adults \u2013 including nearly identical shares of Republicans and Democrats \u2013 were extremely or very concerned that people or organisations seeking to influence the election will use AI to create and distribute fake or misleading information about the candidates and campaigns.\n\nOnly 20 per cent of respondents in the study said that they were very or somewhat confident that the social media companies would prevent their platforms from being misused.\n\nAnother survey by online platform Hosting Advice found that 58 per cent of the surveyed adults had been misled by AI-generated fake news. Seventy per cent of the survey respondents were worried about how fake news might affect the upcoming election.\n\nhttps://www.hostingadvice.com/studies/ai-generated-fake-news-impact/\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor further insights into how AI-driven misinformation could affect the upcoming US elections, The Indian Express spoke to a few AI experts.\n\n\u2018AI literacy is the key\u2019\n\nAlex Mahadevan, who is the director of MediaWise, a nonpartisan, nonprofit initiative of The Poynter Institute that empowers people with the skills to identify misinformation, says generative AI poses 2 significant risks during the 2024 US elections.\n\n\u201cFirst, the fact that anyone can use the paranoia about generative AI to say a real image is synthetic. So you might have a politician say a compromising photo of themselves was actually created through artificial intelligence. This makes it hard for voters to know what to trust. It\u2019s literally getting near impossible to believe your eyes online. Second, it\u2019s the ability for anyone to become a one-person troll farm. They can use generative AI to churn out tons of political propaganda and memes, text, images or audio to support their preferred candidate or denigrate an opponent,\u201d he says.\n\nHow can political campaigns and advocacy groups counteract AI misinformation to protect electoral integrity? AI literacy is the key, says Mahadevan, who is also faculty at Poynter, a nonprofit media institute and newsroom that provides fact-checking, media literacy and journalism ethics training.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTrying to make sure the public is educated on what generative AI tools are capable of and what they are not capable of\u2026 teaching audiences how to do things like a reverse image search so they can determine the provenance of an image or video is how political campaigns and advocacy groups can counteract the spread of generative AI. I think governing bodies should at the very least demand transparency about algorithms behind these AI tools,\u201d he adds.\n\n\u2018Detect and flag fakes immediately\u2019\n\nEliot Higgins, Director, Bellingcat Productions BV, an independent investigative collective of researchers, investigators and citizen journalists, says that one of the biggest risks with generative AI is the creation of deepfakes.\n\n\u201cThese are fake videos or audio clips that look and sound incredibly real, showing politicians saying or doing things they never actually did. It\u2019s kind of scary how convincing they can be, and they have the potential to seriously mislead voters. Plus, AI can churn out loads of fake news articles and social media posts in no time, making it easier to spread misinformation far and wide, something we have seen on various fake news sites used to spread false stories, in the last year in particular. All this can really skew voter perception because people might base their opinions on things that are not true,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cOn how campaigns and advocacy groups can fight back, I think a multi-pronged approach is best. They could invest in tech that helps detect and flag AI-generated fakes early on. Educating the public is huge too\u2014if more people know about deepfakes and how to spot them, it will lessen their impact. Having teams ready to quickly address and debunk false information can make a big difference as well. Collaborating with social media platforms to remove harmful content quickly is also key. And by being transparent and encouraging supporters to fact-check information, they can build more trust,\u201d Higgins adds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRegulatory bodies also have a part to play, says Higgins. \u201cSetting clear guidelines on how AI can be used in political advertising would help. For example, requiring that any AI-generated content is clearly labelled so people know what they are seeing. Holding people accountable if they intentionally spread misinformation is important too\u2014it could deter bad actors. Working with tech companies to improve detection methods would be beneficial, and updating laws to keep pace with technology will help ensure they are prepared to handle new challenges,\u201d he adds.",

        "text": "How Gerrymandering Tilts the 2024 Race for the House\nWhat We Found\n\nOur analysis reveals two divergent stories.\n\nThere is positive news for supporters of fair districts. In many states, maps are much fairer than after the 2010 census, when single-party control of the redistricting process as a result of the midterms gave partisan line drawers free rein to craft some of the most extreme gerrymanders in American history.\n\nThis redistricting cycle has seen notable improvement. State-level redistricting reforms in once-gerrymandered states (Michigan and Virginia), the increased willingness of state courts to enforce limits on partisan gerrymandering (Maryland), and electoral victories resulting in divided government (Pennsylvania) all have helped create fairer maps.\n\nDespite the improvement in some states, single-party control of the redistricting process remains the norm in much of the country. In these states, partisan map drawers have been able to continue to manipulate the process to engineer outsize advantages for the party in charge. The large and fast-growing South has been especially prone to abuse.\n\nNorth Carolina provides a vivid example. With an electorate that is just about evenly divided between the two major parties, the Tar Heel State is regularly among the most electorally competitive in the nation. Under a map put in place by state courts, voters elected 7 Democrats and 7 Republicans to the House in the 2022 midterms. But a new conservative majority elected to the state supreme court dismantled the anti-gerrymandering protections put in place by its predecessor. With the freedom to redraw maps to their pleasure, GOP lawmakers quickly replaced the more equitable court-drawn map with a wildly gerrymandered one. This year, that new map could see the perennial battleground state elect as many as 11 Republicans and just 3 Democrats \u2014 a radically skewed result in a state that is shaping up to be a 2024 presidential battleground.\n\nIn total, our assessment showed that the proposed Freedom to Vote Act\u2019s presumption of extreme partisan bias would have been triggered in 19 states: 11 where Republicans drew maps, 4 where Democrats drew maps, 2 where commissions drew maps, and 2 with court-drawn maps.\n\nIn all but two states, there were hundreds and, in most cases, thousands of alternative maps that would not have been categorized as partisan gerrymanders. In Illinois, for example, a state with a Democratic gerrymander, over 99 percent of alternative maps in the ALARM set satisfied the Freedom to Vote Act. In Texas, a state with a Republican gerrymander, more than 84 percent of alternative maps were compliant. In these states, map drawers had no shortage of alternatives had they wanted to adopt a fair map. They had to go out of their way not to do so.\n\nThe Republican Gerrymanders\n\nTexas and Florida, the two states that gained the most congressional seats this decade, anchor the GOP advantage in this decade\u2019s maps. In 2024, these two big states alone give Republicans a total of 10 additional safe House seats compared to the median Freedom to Vote Act\u2013compliant map.\n\nIn Texas, Democrats currently hold only 13 of 38 seats (34 percent) despite getting between 46 and 48 percent of the vote in recent statewide federal elections. The median Freedom to Vote Act\u2013compliant map, by comparison, has 18 Democratic districts (roughly in line with Democrats\u2019 recent statewide vote share).\n\nCritically, gerrymandering in the Lone Star State also created an electoral firewall for Republicans: 21 of the 25 Texas seats they hold are districts that Donald Trump carried by 15 or more percentage points in 2020. This is a significant change from last decade\u2019s maps, in which there were only 11 such super-Trump districts.\n\n\n\nIn Florida, Republicans undertook an even bigger seat grab, transforming a 16\u201311 edge in the state\u2019s congressional delegation into an astonishing 20\u20138 advantage. They accomplished this feat by making the district Florida picked up in reapportionment a Republican seat and targeting three Democratic incumbents, including a Black Democrat in northern Florida. By contrast, the median Freedom to Vote Act\u2013compliant map has 13 Democratic seats. No Florida congressional races are currently rated as competitive.\n\nThe next biggest building block in Republicans\u2019 advantage is North Carolina. The median Freedom to Vote Act\u2013compliant map has 6 Democratic seats, but the state\u2019s newly gerrymandered map could see the election of just 3 Democrats in 2024. Only one North Carolina district \u2014 a newly gerrymandered district long represented by a Black Democrat \u2014 is rated as competitive this year.\n\nRepublicans also drew a skewed but marginally more competitive map in Ohio that produced a 10\u20135 split in 2022 but could produce a 12\u20133 split this year if Republicans pick up two currently Democratic-held toss-up districts (including one that they likely lost in 2022 only because the Republican candidate lied about his military record). By contrast, the median Freedom to Vote Act\u2013compliant plan has 6 Democratic districts.\n\nAfter these four states, the Republican advantage is rounded out by gerrymanders in a handful of other states.\n\nIn Indiana, Iowa, South Carolina, and Utah, map drawers used the redistricting process to shore up their position by transforming once-competitive GOP-held districts into much more reliably Republican ones.\n\nGOP lawmakers in Tennessee and Georgia were even more aggressive. In Tennessee, Republicans gained a seat after redistricting due to the division of diverse and heavily Democratic Nashville among three districts, eliminating what had long been a safe Democratic seat. A variant of the same maneuver happened in Georgia. There, a federal court ordered lawmakers earlier this year to redraw the map to create an additional Black-majority district. Lawmakers did so, but they offset the creation of that new, all-but-certain Democratic district by dismantling a diverse, multiracial coalition district elsewhere in metro Atlanta and creating a safe Republican district in its stead. As a result, Republicans are guaranteed to keep a 9\u20135 advantage in the state\u2019s congressional delegation. By contrast, the median Freedom to Vote Act\u2013compliant map in Georgia has 7 Democratic districts. No districts in either state are currently rated as competitive.\n\nThe final state that gives Republicans some advantage is Wisconsin, albeit a comparatively weaker one. There, legislative deadlock left the state without a map. The state supreme court stepped in to select a map, adopting a \u201cleast change\u201d approach that left in place a Republican gerrymander from the prior decade. In 2022, that map produced a 6\u20132 Republican advantage in the state\u2019s congressional delegation, though one Republican seat is relatively competitive. By comparison, the median Freedom to Vote Act\u2013compliant map has 3 Democratic or Democratic-leaning districts.\n\nThe Democratic Gerrymanders\n\nIn almost all the states where Democrats controlled the redistricting process, they already held all or nearly all the seats, leaving them few options to increase advantages through gerrymandering. The gerrymanders they produced are also far less reliable than those drawn by Republican counterparts, with Democratic advantages often coming in the form of Democratic-leaning competitive seats rather than safe districts.\n\nThe biggest Democratic offset to Republican gerrymandering is in Illinois, where Democrats were able to take an existing gerrymandered map and tweak it to shore up incumbents and pick up an additional seat in the southern part of the state, giving them a remarkable 14\u20133 edge. Under the map, Republicans have fewer than four seats in Illinois for the first time since before the Civil War. The median Freedom to Vote Act\u2013compliant map, by contrast, has 6 Republican seats.\n\nDemocrats also drew maps in New Mexico and Oregon to pick up an additional seat in each state, but their gerrymanders are much weaker than the fortress gerrymanders Republicans drew in states such as Texas.\n\nIn Oregon, Democrats attempted to engineer a 5\u20131 advantage by making one Republican-leaning district into a Democratic-leaning swing seat. But Republicans managed to win it anyway in 2022, resulting in a 4\u20132 split. The seat remains competitive this year. Similarly, in New Mexico, Democrats attempted to draw a map where they would win all three of the state\u2019s congressional districts. It worked, but just barely, with the party winning the state\u2019s third seat by less than a percentage point in 2022. This year, that district is again rated as a toss-up. The median Freedom to Vote Act\u2013compliant plan has 2 Republican seats in Oregon and 1 in New Mexico.\n\nNew Jersey is the final state that gives Democrats an advantage, although, again, a weaker one compared with pro-Republican gerrymanders elsewhere. After the Garden State\u2019s politically appointed redistricting commission deadlocked, responsibility for picking a map fell to the commission\u2019s unaffiliated tiebreaking member. He selected a map proposed by Democrats under which 10 of 12 districts were carried by Joe Biden in 2020. But in 2022, Republicans were able to flip a district carried by Biden, giving Democrats a 9\u20133 advantage. That seat is again rated as a toss-up this year. By contrast, the median Freedom to Vote Act\u2013compliant map has 4 Republican seats.\n\nIn all these states, other than Illinois, map drawers likely would have a reasonable argument in the rebuttal phase of litigation that the maps should not be considered partisan gerrymanders because of their competitiveness.\n\nThe False Positives\n\nMaps in two states, Connecticut and Massachusetts, produced high rates of partisan bias under the Freedom to Vote Act\u2019s rebuttable-presumption test, but our analysis suggests both would be able to rebut the presumption in litigation with ease.\n\nIn both New England states, Democrats currently win all their congressional seats by comfortable margins, even though Republican statewide candidates routinely receive between at least 30 and 40 percent of the vote (and more in some cases). This is a mismatch but seemingly an unavoidable one \u2014 none of the thousands of alternative plans we reviewed for each state would have resulted in low levels of partisan bias.\n\nThis outcome suggests that for these two states, the distribution of voters, not malfeasance by map drawers, causes the lack of Republican seats. Republican voters, though sizeable as a share of voters in both states, do not come close to being a district-sized majority in either state, making it impossible to draw lines that would yield a distribution of House seats proportional to the partisan balance of the state. They are simply too spread out.\n\nSimilarly, we regard Arizona and Missouri as false positives. Maps in both states triggered a presumption of gerrymandering under the Freedom to Vote Act, but on examination, there were multiple alternative maps in both states that had the same seat split between the parties and at the same time complied with the Freedom to Vote Act. This suggests a strong possibility that a reviewing court would conclude either that the maps did not excessively favor one party over the other or order at most minimal changes that would not affect the parties\u2019 overall seat distribution.",

        "text": "This could be the closest presidential election since 1876\nAccording to 538's latest election forecast, Vice President Kamala Harris has a 57-in-100 chance of winning the presidential election in November, while former President Donald Trump has a 42-in-100 chance. That means the race is essentially a toss-up; based on the closeness of the polls and the equivocacy of non-polling factors we call the \"fundamentals,\" either candidate could easily win in November, and perhaps by a somewhat sizable margin if the polls significantly miss the mark (again).\n\nHarris's advantage over Trump is slightly reduced from a couple of days ago. On Sunday, she had a 62-in-100 chance of winning the election, and we're now forecasting that she will win the national popular vote by 3.2 percentage points rather than by 4 points. The main reason for the decline is several good polls for Trump from The New York Times/Siena College published Monday morning. Those polls had Trump leading Harris by 2 points in North Carolina (our polling average is Trump+0.4), by 3 in Georgia (Trump+1.3 on average) and by 5 in Arizona (Trump+1 in 538's average). That last survey was a particular boon for Trump, given the pollster's last survey in Arizona had Harris up by 5 \u2014 a 10-point swing toward Trump.\n\nHowever, our model is skeptical that Trump has made gains this large. That's because, while The New York Times/Siena College had good news for Trump, other pollsters have been releasing positive numbers for Harris \u2014 such as a Harris+5 national survey from NBC News released Sunday and a Harris+6 poll of Wisconsin released by MassINC Polling Group on Monday. Because our model sees support for Harris and Trump as correlated across states, it discounts when one pollster shows large movements that don't appear elsewhere. But don't just take our word for it; The New York Times's Nate Cohn suggested he is similarly skeptical, writing on Monday, \"In circumstances like this, our rule of thumb is to toss the results into a polling average.\"\n\nThe bottom line right now is that the election remains incredibly close. Our model is currently forecasting that the margin between Trump and Harris will be less than 1 point in four states (North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada), and within 4 points (the size of a normal polling error) in four more (Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan and Florida).\n\n538\u2019s forecasted margin of victory for the eight states with the closest races in the 2024 general election as of Sept. 24, 2024 at 2 p.m. Eastern. 538 photo illustration\n\nBut the election isn't just close on the individual state level. It could also be historically close in the Electoral College. As the table above shows, there is currently a split between the northern battleground states, where Harris is currently leading, and most Sun Belt states, where Trump is currently leading. And this split makes especially tight Electoral College victories more likely.\n\nFor example, if you assume the forecast will be exactly correct and assign all states and congressional districts to the candidate who currently leads in them, and then you move Nevada just 0.8 percentage points toward Trump, Harris would win 270 electoral votes and Trump would win 268. That would be the smallest electoral-vote margin in a presidential election since 1876, when Republican Rutherford B. Hayes beat Democrat Samuel J. Tilden by one electoral vote. Even in 2000, Republican George W. Bush defeated Democrat Al Gore by the comparably comfortable margin of 271 to 267.\n\nIf those past elections are any guide, that could be a recipe for chaos in the weeks after Election Day. In 2000, the outcome of the election was murky for weeks as Florida, the decisive state that year, conducted multiple recounts. In 1876, the election result was disputed until just days before Inauguration Day, as some states sent conflicting sets of returns to Congress. In 2000, there were protests; in 1876, there were threats of violence. Here in 2024, it's possible that the losing candidate in such a tight race could contest the election in one or more states, which could in turn cause unrest among voters. Trump, for instance, has already called the veracity of mail-in ballots into question, and Republicans have begun suing state governments over registration processes they allege will let noncitizens vote in the election. And Trump has previously declined to rule out political violence from his supporters if he doesn't believe the election is fair.\n\nBut while the polls point to a close race today, the election is also \"close\" in the sense that small polling misses or slight changes in the national environment could lead to one candidate winning by a comfortable margin. The uncertainty about the outcome, in other words, makes things look \"close\" probabilistically (in the sense that each candidate has about an equal chance to win) but does not mean that big wins aren't also possible. According to our forecast, for example, there is a 1-in-6 chance that one of the candidates wins the popular vote by more than 10 points.\n\nWe'll be watching how Harris's and Trump's margins change in our forecast over the next few weeks in order to gauge the closeness of the race going into election night. Check back in on our polling averages and forecast as the race heads into its final six weeks!",

        "summary": " A new CNN poll finds 48% support Harris and 47% Trump, a margin that suggests no clear leader in the race . Both Harris and Trump hold positive support from the majority of their backers . 72% of Trump\u2019s supporters say their choice is more for him than against Harris .",
        "text": "CNN Poll: Harris and Trump locked in exceedingly close presidential race\nCNN \u2014\n\nThe race for president between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump is exceedingly close, with Harris\u2019 support resting on stronger personal appeal, while Trump draws on a die-hard base and a wide advantage on handling the economy to run about even despite less positive views of him, his empathy and temperament.\n\nAmong likely voters nationwide, a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS finds 48% support Harris and 47% Trump, a margin that suggests no clear leader in the race. About 2% say they plan to vote for Libertarian Chase Oliver and 1% for Green Party nominee Jill Stein. Both Harris and Trump hold positive support from the majority of their backers \u2013 72% of Trump\u2019s supporters say their choice is more for him than against Harris, while 60% of Harris\u2019 supporters say their choice is more for her than against him.\n\nThat\u2019s a major shift in voters\u2019 attitudes toward the race compared with earlier this summer. In the last national CNN poll in July, shortly after President Joe Biden ended his campaign for president and Harris threw her hat into the ring for the Democratic nomination, Harris\u2019 backers were evenly divided between affirmative support for her and those driven by anti-Trump sentiment. And Biden\u2019s supporters in earlier polls said they were largely expressing opposition to Trump with their choice.\n\nThe latest poll finds Harris and Trump roughly even with independent likely voters \u2013 Harris at 45% to Trump at 41% - with a gender gap that is centered among independents. Independent women break 51% Harris to 36% Trump while independent men split 47% for Trump to 40% for Harris, with very little difference between men and women in either party.\n\nThe gender divide in the poll is also more concentrated among White voters (White men break 58% Trump to 35% Harris, while White women split 50% Trump to 47% Harris), with very little gender divide among Black or Latino voters. Harris is well ahead among likely voters younger than 30 (55% support her to 38% who favor Trump), and among Black (79% Harris to 16% Trump) and Latino (59% Harris to 40% Trump) likely voters.\n\nA scant 2% of likely voters say they haven\u2019t yet chosen a candidate to support, and another 12% have chosen one but say they could change their minds.\n\nThe poll suggests that overall, Harris has begun to build a more positive public image, outpacing Trump across several measures of how the public views her personally.\n\nSince becoming the Democratic presidential nominee, Harris\u2019 favorability rating has climbed to its highest level in CNN polling since just before her and Biden\u2019s inauguration in January 2021 (currently 46% favorable to 48% unfavorable among likely voters), while Trump\u2019s has held steady (currently 42% favorable to 55% unfavorable among likely voters).\n\nAlthough many voters are still forming opinions of the major candidates for vice president, Harris\u2019 choice for a running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, has a notably more positive favorability rating (36% favorable to 32% unfavorable) than Trump\u2019s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance (30% favorable to 42% unfavorable).\n\nA narrow majority or more of likely voters nationwide say Harris\u2019 temperament (58%), background and life experience (56%), ability to understand their problems (52%), skills as a leader (51%) and vision for the country (51%) align with what they want in a president. For Trump, by contrast, about half of likely voters or fewer say his vision for the country (49%), skills as a leader (49%), background (46%), ability to empathize with people like them (46%) or temperament (38%) align with their vision of a president.\n\nBut notably, in this divided race, 51% say each of them has policy positions on major issues that align with what they want in a president, with more saying Trump\u2019s are exactly what they want in a president (29% for Trump vs. 18% for Harris).\n\nThat\u2019s true even as Trump is more broadly seen as \u201ctoo extreme\u201d in his views and positions than Harris is (54% of likely voters say Trump is, 42% that Harris is). A small group of those who see Trump as too extreme are voting for him anyway: He holds the support of 10% of likely voters who consider his views and policies to be too extreme, while Harris has the backing of just 4% of those likely voters who feel she is too extreme.\n\nTrump also benefits from the 51% of likely voters who say that looking back on his time as president, it was more of a success than a failure. And Harris may be impeded by the widespread perception of Biden\u2019s time as president as a failure (61% see it that way, and only 19% in that group say they support Harris for president).\n\nLikely voters overall say they trust Trump over Harris to handle the economy (50% Trump to 39% Harris), immigration (49% Trump to 35% Harris) and foreign policy (47% Trump to 40% Harris). Even among those who say Trump\u2019s views and policies are too extreme, 15% say they trust him over Harris to handle the economy and the same share say so on immigration.\n\nLikely voters generally favor Harris\u2019 approach on abortion and reproductive rights (52% Harris to 31% Trump), uniting the country (43% Harris to 30% Trump), and protecting democracy (47% Harris to 40% Trump).\n\nAbout 4 in 10 likely voters (41%) call the economy the most important issue for them as they choose a candidate for president, with protecting democracy second at 21%, immigration at 12% and abortion at 11%. Harris\u2019 voters are more likely to choose protecting democracy as most important (37%) over the economy (21%) or abortion (19%), while Trump\u2019s supporters are concentrated on the economy (61%) and immigration (21%).\n\nVoters who prioritize the economy, regardless of whom they support for president, are broadly focused on inflation. A majority (55%) of them say in a follow-up question that inflation is the top economic issue on their minds as they consider the candidates, with only federal spending (12%) and taxes (11%) joining it in double-digits. Inflation is still a widespread consideration even among those for whom the economy is not the top issue: 32% in that group say inflation is the biggest economic issue they\u2019re considering, 16% jobs and wages, 15% federal spending, 13% the cost of housing and 12% taxes.\n\nAmong registered voters, 77% say that the recent tone of America\u2019s politics and political debate is encouraging violence among some people, the same as the share who felt that way in September 2019, and 72% in the new poll say the amount of political violence in the US is a major problem. Registered voters are more inclined to expect political violence to get worse than better, regardless of which candidate is elected this year, but more (57%) say it would get worse should Trump be elected, than if Harris were (42%).\n\nDemocrats are more apt than Republicans or independents to see the recent tone as encouraging violence (81% among Democratic registered voters compared with 76% among independents registered to vote and 73% among Republican registered voters). But partisans on both sides agree on the severity of the problem (75% of Democratic voters and 73% of Republican voters call it a major problem; slightly fewer independent voters feel the same way, 69%).\n\nDemocratic voters are far more likely to say the risk of political violence will get worse should Trump win (86%) than Republican voters are to say the risk will be higher should Harris win (65%). Republican voters are also more likely to say things would get worse should their own candidate win (30%) than Democratic voters are to foresee a higher risk for violence if Harris wins (18%).\n\nAmong all registered voters, 47% say they would feel \u201cafraid\u201d if Trump won the election, and a similar 45% would feel that way should Harris win. Forty-one percent would be \u201cangry\u201d if Trump won, slightly more than those who would feel that way if Harris did (37%).\n\nAnd there\u2019s a notable shift compared with 2016 among registered voters who say they would feel more positive emotions if Trump were to win: 41% of voters say they would be excited if Trump won, compared with just 27% who felt that way in June 2016, and 38% say they would be proud, up from 24% who said the same eight years ago. The share saying they\u2019d feel embarrassed has dropped, from 56% then to 48% now.\n\nHarris inspires more positive emotions than Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton did in the summer of 2016. Should Harris win, 41% of registered voters say they would feel proud, and 40% excited, compared with a respective 35% and 29% who said the same about Clinton then. The share saying they\u2019d feel embarrassed by a Harris win (41%) is about the same as it was for Clinton (39%).\n\nThe CNN Poll was conducted by SSRS online and by telephone September 19-22, 2024, among 2,074 registered voters nationwide drawn from a probability-based panel. Likely voters include all registered voters in the poll weighted for their predicted likelihood of voting in this year\u2019s election. Results for the full sample of registered voters have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.0 percentage points. It is the same among likely voters and larger for subgroups.",

Bing Guan/Reuters\n\nSurrogates for former President Donald Trump encouraged Wisconsin voters to vote by mail, while also casting doubt on drop boxes, as absentee ballots have already started going out in the state.\n\nWisconsin Republican Party Chairman Brian Schimming told dozens of Republicans gathered for a stop on a \u201cTeam Trump\u201d bus tour, \u201cwe\u2019re not one of 50 states this year, by the way. We\u2019re one of seven,\u201d laying out the stakes of the election in the battleground state.\n\nHe later noted that last Thursday was the deadline for absentee ballots to start being mailed to voters in Wisconsin and called it \u201csimple arithmetic\u201d why Republicans are pushing their voters to cast ballots before Election Day this year, instead of discouraging mail and early voting.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t keep going into Election Day 100,000 votes down and expect to make it up in 13 hours. It doesn\u2019t work anymore,\u201d Schimming said, referencing how in previous elections Democrats have typically cast mail ballots.\n\nSchimming said the \u201csooner\u201d Republicans can get votes in and process them, the \u201csooner we can win this election,\u201d saying he\u2019s not interested in a lengthy recount process.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve done multiple statewide recounts. I\u2019m not really interested in being up all night again. The only reason I want to be up all night on election night is to party with Donald Trump,\u201d he said, encouraging the Republican voters at the event to talk to \u201cfolks that don\u2019t generally vote\u201d and to get them to cast ballots.\n\nWashington County Executive Josh Schoemann encouraged Republicans to \u201cbank your vote,\u201d echoing the argument made by Trump and the RNC that, \u201cwe, the people, have the control by swamping the vote, by making it too big to rig.\u201d\n\nWhile Republicans are encouraging early voting, they continue to oppose the use of drop boxes to collect absentee ballots. The Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled this year that officials can place ballot drop boxes around their communities in this fall\u2019s elections, overturning its own ruling two years ago limiting their use in the presidential swing state.\n\nDodge County Sheriff Dale Schmidt, who has endorsed Trump, has said he\u2019s \u201chappy to say\u201d there are not drop boxes in the county.\n\nDemocrats, election officials and some Republicans have argued the boxes are secure and an Associated Press survey of state election officials across the US revealed no cases of fraud, vandalism or theft that could have affected the results in 2020.",

        "text": "Harris holds a big lead with Asian-American voters, new survey shows\nYour trusted source for contextualizing abortion and Election 2024 news. Sign up for our daily newsletter.\n\nMore Asian-American voters are planning to support the Democrat at the top of the presidential ticket now that Vice President Kamala Harris is the nominee, according to the 2024 AAPI Voter Survey released Tuesday.\n\nHarris, whose campaign has been specifically reaching out to Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) voters, has a 38-point lead over Republican former President Donald Trump among Asian Americans. It\u2019s a significantly wider advantage than the 15-point lead President Joe Biden had with Asian-American voters in a spring survey, before Biden dropped out of the presidential race and Harris became the Democrats\u2019 standard-bearer.\n\nIn May, Biden led Trump 46 percent to 31 percent, with 23 percent undecided or backing a third-party candidate. Now, 66 percent of Asian-American voters back Harris, compared with 28 percent for Trump and just 6 percent for a third party.\n\nIt\u2019s a return to 2020 levels of support for the Democratic ticket, according to Karthick Ramakrishnan, the executive director and founder of AAPI Data, one of the groups that conducted the survey. \u201cWhen it comes to voter enthusiasm and intention to vote, we\u2019re seeing levels on par with 2020, which was a historic election in terms of having record high turnout for Asian Americans. All these ingredients point toward Asian Americans having a pretty powerful role in the Harris candidacy.\u201d\n\nHarris\u2019 favorability has also risen 18 points; it is 62 percent now versus 44 percent in the spring.\n\nFor Asian-American voters, Harris\u2019 gender is more important (38 percent) than her Asian-American identity (27 percent). It\u2019s noteworthy given that Harris\u2019 mother was an immigrant from India.\n\nIt\u2019s all the more surprising given the role that race has come to play in the campaign, especially since Trump has sought to center Harris\u2019 race by questioning whether she is Black or South Asian. (She is both.) \u201cGender is not explicitly talked about as much in this campaign by Trump \u2014 it\u2019s [Harris\u2019] racial identity that\u2019s being talked about a lot more. So I think it\u2019s one of those things that seems under the radar compared to Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 candidacy, but is emerging as a pretty powerful force,\u201d Ramakrishnan said.\n\nChristine Chen, a co-founder and executive director of APIAVote, added that AAPI voters\u2019 attitudes on Harris\u2019 gender reflect much of the grassroots organizing happening on her behalf. \u201cSouth Asians for Harris, Chinese Americans for Harris, Korean Americans for Harris \u2014 we saw such activation coming from the community and partially, I think it is because of her ethnicity, but it was also driven by the women in those communities.\u201d\n\nAAPI women are more likely to support Harris (70 percent) than AAPI men (57 percent). Chen said much of this work, and excitement, also has to do with how Asian-American women are working with Black women and Latinas across organizing spaces, bringing together a racially diverse coalition of voters.\n\nAnd these women have been organizing for a decade already, Ramakrishnan said.\n\n\u201cSo you combine that with having the historic nature of her candidacy as not only the first Asian American but as the first woman and Asian-American woman, and that combines, I think, into a pretty potent combination,\u201d he said.\n\nThe AAPI Voter Survey is a joint effort between AAPI Data and APIAVote, and was administered Sept. 3-9 by NORC at the University of Chicago. The survey was offered in English, Chinese dialects of Mandarin and Cantonese, Vietnamese and Korean, and oversampled citizens and registered voters. The margin of error is 4.7 percentage points.\n\nThe Harris campaign has been working to reach AAPI communities, and it appears to be paying off: 62 percent say they have been contacted by the Democratic Party, compared with 46 percent who have had the Republican Party reach out.\n\nLast week, the Harris campaign released its third ad specifically targeting Asian-American voters, titled \u201cMy Mother.\u201d It repurposes part of Harris\u2019 acceptance speech from last month\u2019s Democratic National Convention when she described her mom \u2014 \u201ca brilliant 5-foot-tall Brown woman with an accent\u201d \u2014 and said her mother taught her family \u201cto never complain about injustice but do something about it.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, when APIAVote had a presidential town hall earlier this summer, Republicans didn\u2019t even send a surrogate, Chen said.\n\nFor many AAPI voters, Ramakrishnan said, the top issue is \u201cracism and discrimination.\u201d Seventy-two percent of AAPI voters said they wouldn\u2019t be willing to vote for a candidate who doesn\u2019t share their views on racism or discrimination.\n\nSince first entering presidential politics in 2015, Trump has demonized immigrants. He also repeatedly referred to COVID-19 as the \u201cChina virus,\u201d which was followed by a rise in discrimination and attacks against Asian Americans. Recently, Trump\u2019s running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, has amplified racist conspiracy theories about Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, that he knows are false.\n\n\u201cEven if the Republican Party is investing in voter outreach, to the extent that party leaders continue to engage in talk that is perceived as xenophobic or racist, it\u2019ll make it really difficult to win support among Asian-American voters,\u201d Ramakrishnan said. \u201cThat\u2019s just very real. Absolutely, the parties need to invest, but what party leaders say also matters.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to ignore the role of racism and discrimination,\u201d Ramakrishnan continued. \u201cSo the extent that you see both Trump and Vance not only dog whistling on race, but blowing their bullhorns on race, that\u2019s something that will prevent the Republican Party from capitalizing on any frustration people have with not only Biden, but Harris.\u201d\n\nThe Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment on outreach to AAPI voters.\n\nAccording to a separate survey released Tuesday by KFF, 45 percent of Asian immigrants say the way Trump talks about immigrants has negatively affected the way they\u2019re treated. Just 7 percent said that about Harris. In fact, 30 percent of Asian immigrants said Harris\u2019 rhetoric has had a positive effect on how they have been treated.\n\nChen pointed to Georgia as a state where AAPI voters \u2014 particularly newly registered voters \u2014 could make a difference. Biden won the state in 2020 by less than 12,000 votes in a year with about 39,000 first-time AAPI voters, she said.\n\nRamakrishnan said the second biggest issue for AAPI voters is abortion, which Harris has made a centerpiece of her candidacy.\n\n\u201cAsian Americans are some of the strongest supporters of abortion rights in this country,\u201d Ramakrishnan said. \u201cSupport for abortion rights is high even among Asian Americans who are predominantly Catholic, like Filipinos. I think something very underappreciated is how much abortion plays a role in the public opinion of Asian American voters.\u201d\n\nAmong AAPI voters in the survey, 63 percent said they would not vote for a candidate who does not share their view on abortion policy. There is a 20-point gender split \u2014 72 percent of AAPI women and 52 percent of AAPI men \u2014 on the question.\n\nThough there are six weeks until Election Day, Chen said the candidates would be wise to understand that for AAPI voters, the window to reach them is even shorter: in the 2022 midterms, 73 percent voted early or by mail.\n\nTo check your voter registration status or to get more information about registering to vote, text 19thnews to 26797.",

Trump has denied wrongdoing and sentencing was originally due to take place on Sept. 18.\n\n- Dec. 17: Electors, who together form the Electoral College, meet in their respective states or the District of Columbia to select the president and vice president.\n\n- Dec. 25: The electoral votes must be received by the President of the Senate - a role held by the vice president, currently Harris- and the archivist by this date.\n\n2025\n\n- Jan. 6: The vice president presides over the Electoral College vote count at a joint session of Congress, announces the results and declares who has been elected.\n\nAhead of the count on Jan. 6, 2021, Trump lambasted his vice president, Mike Pence, for refusing to try to prevent Congress from certifying Biden's win. On that day, the U.S. Capitol was attacked by Trump supporters trying to stop the count. Biden's win was certified later that day.\n\nCongress has since passed the Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act of 2022, which requires approval of one-fifth of the House and Senate to consider a challenge to a state's results \u2013 a much higher bar than existed before, when any single lawmaker from each chamber could trigger a challenge.\n\n- Jan. 20: The inauguration of the election winner and their vice president takes place.

        "text": "The first graders who survived Sandy Hook will vote in their first presidential election\nGrace Fischer survived the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School by staying quiet and huddled, as her first grade teacher softly read \u201cThe Nutcracker.\u201d\n\nThen she spent the rest of her childhood watching mostly from the sidelines as dozens of similar shootings shattered other schools across the country.\n\nNow 18, Fischer will vote in her first presidential election in November. It\u2019s a monumental moment, nearly 12 years after she endured one of the deadliest school shootings in U.S. history, and it has given her and her peers hope that they can effect change.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge turning point in our lives,\u201d said Fischer, who was 6 when a gunman killed 20 first graders and six educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School on Dec. 14, 2012.\n\nFrom left, Grace Fischer, Henry Terifay, Lilly Wasilnak and Matt Holden during their meeting with Harris. Lawrence Jackson / The White House\n\nActivists at the time hoped the tragedy in Newtown, Connecticut, would become a watershed moment and spark significant legislative action, said Emma Brown, executive director of Giffords, the gun safety group founded by former Rep. Gabby Giffords \u2014 a shooting survivor.\n\n\u201cThe country was forced to look at this issue in a visceral, terrible way,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThe loss of all of those kids in their classroom was so inconceivable and so horrific that even the politicians and the folks who had been trying to act like this wasn\u2019t a growing problem in this country were unable to deny it for the first time.\u201d\n\nStates have since passed hundreds of gun-safety laws, but major federal bills that have been proposed, including bans on semiautomatic weapons and high-capacity magazines, have failed.\n\nAfter the Las Vegas mass shooting in 2017, the Trump administration imposed a federal ban on bump stocks, which are gun accessories that allow semiautomatic rifles to fire more quickly. But the Supreme Court overturned the regulation this year.\n\nFriday marked 20 years since the 1994 federal assault weapons ban expired in 2004. Meanwhile, mass shootings have become more frequent.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be this way. Emma brown, giffords executive director\n\nSince 2013, at least 122 people have been killed by gunfire in 64 planned school shootings, according to NBC News\u2019 tracker. Most recently, on Sept. 4, two students and two teachers were killed at Georgia\u2019s Apalachee High School allegedly by a 14-year-old suspect with an AR-style rifle, authorities said.\n\nOn Thursday, the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions said guns were the leading cause of death among children and teens, killing more people ages 1 to 17 in the U.S. than car crashes and cancer, for the third year in a row.\n\n\u201cWe were told this would be what turns everything around,\u201d said Emma Ehrens, 18, who was next to the Sandy Hook gunman as he shot her classmates. \u201cIt really breaks your heart a little bit more every time.\u201d\n\nA memorial site along a road in Sandy Hook after the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in 2012. Lisa Wiltse / Corbis via Getty Images file\n\nEhrens, Fischer and two other first grade Sandy Hook survivors who spoke to NBC News said they are hoping to turn the tide by electing Vice President Kamala Harris as president.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a no-brainer for me,\u201d said survivor Lilly Wasilnak, 18.\n\nThe teens first met Harris at the White House on National Gun Violence Awareness Day on June 6, as they were preparing to graduate high school. They shared their individual accounts of the shooting with Harris, who thanked them for their courage.\n\n\u201cNone of you should have had the experience that you\u2019ve had at all,\u201d Harris told them, according to a video released by the White House. \u201cKnow that you guys are moving the needle.\u201d\n\nHarris has said keeping students safe from gun violence at schools is a top priority. Her plan, which the survivors support, includes banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and requiring universal background checks.\n\nHarris also champions so-called red flag laws that allow a family member or law enforcement to seek a court order to temporarily confiscate guns if they feel a gun owner may cause harm.\n\nHarris listens to Emma Ehrens, center, and Ella Seaver, left. Lawrence Jackson / The White House\n\nMatt Holden, another survivor who turned 18 last month, said these plans differ from those of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, who received backlash last week after saying school shootings are a \u201cfact of life.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like this. I don\u2019t like to admit this. I don\u2019t like that this is a fact of life,\u201d the Ohio senator said at a rally in Phoenix. \u201cBut if you\u2019re, if you are a psycho and you want to make headlines, you realize that our schools are soft targets.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to bolster security so if a psycho wants to walk through the front door and kill a bunch of children, they\u2019re not able to,\u201d Vance added.\n\nAt the rally, Vance said strict firearms restrictions are not the solution. Similarly, at a National Rifle Association event in May, Trump said he would roll back Biden administration executive orders designed to reduce gun violence.\n\nIn a response to a request for comment, the Trump campaign provided quotes from relatives of shooting victims in support of the former president, including JT Lewis, whose brother Jesse was killed in the Sandy Hook shooting.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump established the Federal School Safety Commission and signed the Stop School Violence Act,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cHe supports hardening schools and protecting our nation\u2019s children. Kamala Harris wants to take police out of schools and leave our kids defenseless. The choice is easy.\u201d\n\nBrown, the Giffords executive director, said gun safety laws are the way forward to ensure school shootings do not remain the norm.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a ticket in this race that says over and over that it doesn\u2019t have to be this way,\u201d she said.\n\nGiffords spent $15 million to help Harris\u2019 campaign as well as other House candidates who favor tougher gun laws, NBC News first reported.\n\nSince Sandy Hook, states have passed more than 620 gun safety laws, Brown said. In 2022, President Joe Biden enacted the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the most significant gun-safety law in nearly 30 years.\n\n\u201cThe momentum is there, and the will is there,\u201d Brown said.\n\nThis fall, when the survivors vote for the first time, Wasilnak and Holden said it will be in honor of their first grade classmates who will not get to experience this milestone, as well as the educators who died making sure they would.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m casting a vote for the 26 who can\u2019t,\u201d Wasilnak said.",

        "text": "Swing state election officials say they'll sue counties that won't certify 2024 result\nANN ARBOR, Mich. \u2212 Top election officials in major swing states say they are prepared to take local governments to court if they refuse to certify the 2024 presidential election, a move that could impede an effort to overturn the election if former President Donald Trump loses.\n\nOfficials from Arizona, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin made the comments in interviews with USA TODAY and at a public event at the University of Michigan on Thursday as they sought to assure the public that they would protect the legitimacy of the election.\n\n\u201cWe would immediately take them to court to compel them to certify, and we\u2019re confident \u2212 because of how clear the election law is in Pennsylvania \u2212 that the courts would expeditiously require the counties to certify their election results,\u201d said Pennsylvania Secretary of State Al Schmidt.\n\nIn battleground states and states where Vice President Kamala Harris is depending on victories to secure an Electoral College majority, county officials have voted against or delayed certifying the results of elections at least three dozen times since 2020 \u2212 from the presidential race down to school board recounts.\n\nIt's an outgrowth of Trump and his allies' strategy to overturn the 2020 election by stopping Congress from certifying President Joe Biden's victory. Local officials who refuse to certify a county's results in 2024 may intend to stop Harris' electoral votes from their state from being sent to Congress in the first place.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nThough past local votes against certification have yet to overturn the results of an election, they have nonetheless left experts and observers wondering what will happen if rogue county officials are successful when certification of the presidential election begins Nov. 6. But key election officials say they\u2019re prepared.\n\nKeeping up with Election 2024? Sign up for USA TODAY's On Politics newsletter.\n\n\u2018The state would sue\u2019\n\nSchmidt, a Republican who stood against efforts to overturn the 2020 election when he was a local government official in Philadelphia, pointed to three counties the state took to court during the 2022 primary to force them to certify the election results.\n\n\u201cBecause we have dealt with that before, we will be prepared should it occur again,\u201d he said.\n\nLisa Marra, Arizona\u2019s elections director, a nonpartisan official who works for Democratic Secretary of State Adrian Fontes, said Arizona would take the same approach.\n\n\u201cThe state would sue to get them to canvass the election,\u201d Marra said of a county that refuses to certify. \u201cIf they refuse to canvass at that point, we\u2019d go back to court, and the state could actually move forward without those results.\u201d\n\nMeagan Wolfe, the nonpartisan administrator for the Wisconsin Election Commission, declined to disclose the exact legal process that would be used to enforce certification of an election but said she and others have been thinking about who has the power to do what.\n\n\u201cI feel very confident that if we were to have that kind of issue where we had to have a court intervene to mandate somebody to do their mandatory responsibilities, we\u2019d be able to resolve that very quickly,\u201d she said.\n\nNevada\u2019s attorney general and secretary of state, both Democrats, took a county to court earlier this year when it refused to certify a local election. At the time, Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford said he would \u201cnever hesitate to join the secretary of state in protecting Nevada\u2019s elections.\u201d\n\nOther remedies?\n\nGeorgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, told USA TODAY it may not be necessary to engage with a county that didn\u2019t certify, but he added, \u201cAt the end of the day, we will make sure that every county follows the law and follows the Constitution.\u201d\n\nIn Michigan, the state can step in and certify an election if a county board of canvassers does not, said Jonathan Brater, the director of elections. He said a vote against certifying wouldn't stop the election from eventually being certified but would be \"wasting a lot of time and money when the state has to do it all over again.\"\n\nKaren Brinson Bell, the nonpartisan executive director of the North Carolina State Board of Elections, pointed to the oath that members of county boards of elections take that requires them to certify an election unless there\u2019s cause to believe there was misconduct.\n\n\u201cSo there has to be actual evidence, actual grounds,\u201d she told USA TODAY.\n\nThe North Carolina State Board of Elections in 2023 removed two members from the Surry County Board of Elections for refusing to certify an election in protest over state election guidance. \u201cThat\u2019s not a reason to overturn an election, or to not certify an election,\u201d Brinson Bell said. \u201cAnd so there was a complaint filed. The State Board heard that. And both members were removed.\u201d",

        "text": "Election 2024: Where Trump and Harris stand on crypto\nAlmost half of all corporate money contributed to this year\u2019s federal election campaigns \u2014 yes, nearly half \u2014 has come from crypto backers, according to a recent report from the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen.\n\nBut what do these crypto supporters want, exactly? And where do presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris stand on cryptocurrency and its still-murky regulatory future?\n\nIn this article, we break down both candidates\u2019 stances, along with a look at how much money major crypto corporations have poured into political contributions this year \u2014 and what they\u2019re hoping to achieve with that influence.\n\nCrypto\u2019s deep pockets in the 2024 election\n\nCryptocurrency \u2014 once hailed as a fad and the preferred form of payment for shadowy characters \u2014 has increasingly become mainstream. And its deep-pocketed loyalists are spending big to win influence in the 2024 elections.\n\nCrypto corporations and wealthy investors have poured over $119 million directly into influencing federal elections, according to an Aug. 21 report from Public Citizen, a nonprofit progressive consumer rights advocacy group based in Washington, D.C.\n\nThat money is mostly being funneled into a non-partisan super PAC called Fairshake, which has amassed over $202 million during the 2023-2024 election cycle, with the aim of electing pro-crypto candidates and defeating crypto skeptics.\n\nCrypto companies \u2014 primarily Coinbase and Ripple \u2014 are now the dominant corporate political spenders in 2024, according to the report, accounting for nearly half (48 percent) of all corporate money contributed during this year\u2019s elections. In fact, since 2010, crypto corporations have been the second-biggest election-related spenders, trailing only fossil fuel corporations.\n\nCryptocurrency executives and advocates argue that tens of millions of people care about digital currency. Yet a survey by the Federal Reserve finds only about 7 percent of Americans held or used crypto in 2023.\n\nWhere the 2024 presidential candidates stand on cryptocurrency\n\nWith crypto lobbyists emerging as a major force in the 2024 election, both Trump and Harris face increasing pressure to define their positions on the issue.\n\nKamala Harris\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has yet to take an official position on cryptocurrency during her brief campaign as the Democratic nominee, reflecting the broader uncertainty within her party.\n\nDemocrats have some catching up to do with the crypto crowd, especially since the Biden administration has been seen by crypto backers as unfriendly to the industry.\n\nThe Security and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC\u2019s) crackdown on the industry began about two years ago, following the collapse of FTX, the world\u2019s third-largest crypto exchange at the time. The SEC responded by hitting top crypto firms with a wave of lawsuits, accusing them of bypassing fundamental investor protections. Two of the highest-profile cases take aim at the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, Binance, and the biggest U.S.-based exchange, Coinbase.\n\nThe litigation follows several failed efforts by the SEC to restrict crypto\u2019s wider adoption, including blocking the approval of Bitcoin ETFs, which a federal judge overruled in 2023, paving the way for the new funds to begin trading in January 2024.\n\nBut with big money and potential voters in swing states up for grabs, Democratic party leaders are working to improve relations with the crypto industry \u2014 even if their nominee has yet to take an official stance.\n\nIn July, 14 House Democrats penned a letter to the Democratic National Committee\u2019s head, urging the party to embrace pro-crypto policies in its platform, according to Politico.\n\nIn mid-August, party officials jumped on a video call with the crypto industry to \u201creset\u201d their relationship with the sector. The group of cryptocurrency advocates, dubbed Crypto4Harris, hosted a roughly 90-minute virtual town hall that featured a \u201cWho\u2019s Who\u201d of Democratic lawmakers, aimed at deepening the link with the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nThe Crypto4Harris group is also planning nationwide grassroots fundraisers in September to rally support for Harris, according to Reuters.\n\nHarris noted her plans to \u201cencourage innovative technologies like AI and digital assets\u201d during a New York City fundraiser on Sept. 22, marking her first official comments on cryptocurrency as a presidential candidate.\n\nHarris\u2019 statements, made at a high-profile event in Manhattan, suggest she may take a more open stance toward the crypto industry compared to the current administration. Still, Harris hasn\u2019t laid out specific policy plans, leaving some in the crypto space hoping for additional details.\n\nThe event, held at Cipriani Wall Street, raised a staggering $27 million, making it the biggest single-day fundraising total of Harris\u2019 campaign.\n\nDonald Trump\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, who once voiced skepticism about cryptocurrency, has repositioned himself as the pro-crypto presidential candidate.\n\nIn the summer of 2019, Trump criticized cryptocurrency on social media, claiming it could be used to facilitate illegal activities like drug trafficking. And during his presidency, the Trump administration\u2019s regulatory actions included the SEC\u2019s controversial lawsuit against Ripple.\n\nBut Trump changed his tune in 2024, aiming to win over a bloc of single-issue voters and \u2014 perhaps more crucially \u2014 big-ticket donors in the cryptocurrency world.\n\nIn July, at a major cryptocurrency conference in Nashville, Tennessee, Trump declared that he wants the U.S. to become the \u201ccrypto capital of the planet\u201d and the Bitcoin \u201csuperpower of the world.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign now accepts Bitcoin donations, and it recently launched digital NFT trading cards depicting the former president dancing, wearing a superhero suit and holding Bitcoin, available for $99 on the Trump campaign website. His vice presidential running mate, Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio), is also a longtime crypto advocate.\n\nThe Republican National Committee even mentions cryptocurrency in its official party platform, noting that Trump will defend the right to mine Bitcoin and \u201censure every American has the right to self-custody of their Digital Assets, and transact free from Government Surveillance and Control.\u201d\n\nAt the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville, Trump detailed a set of crypto-friendly policies. He also claimed that Bitcoin\u2019s price would soar under his administration.\n\nSome of Trump\u2019s crypto policy proposals include:\n\nCreate a government stockpile of Bitcoin: During the conference, Trump noted that his administration would \u201ckeep 100 percent of all the Bitcoin the U.S. government currently holds or acquires into the future,\u201d adding that the digital currency would act as the \u201ccore of the strategic national Bitcoin stockpile.\u201d It\u2019s estimated the U.S. government held more than $5 billion worth of Bitcoin as of October 2023, largely seized from criminal investigations. However, it\u2019s unclear what the stockpile would be used for, whether it\u2019s realistic or if it\u2019s even welcomed by the broader crypto industry.\n\nDuring the conference, Trump noted that his administration would \u201ckeep 100 percent of all the Bitcoin the U.S. government currently holds or acquires into the future,\u201d adding that the digital currency would act as the \u201ccore of the strategic national Bitcoin stockpile.\u201d It\u2019s estimated the U.S. government held more than $5 billion worth of Bitcoin as of October 2023, largely seized from criminal investigations.

Create a crypto advisory council: In Nashville, Trump proposed launching a group called the \u201cBitcoin and crypto presidential advisory council\u201d which would have rules \u201cwritten by people who love your industry, not hate your industry.\u201d\n\nIn Nashville, Trump proposed launching a group called the \u201cBitcoin and crypto presidential advisory council\u201d which would have rules \u201cwritten by people who love your industry, not hate your industry.\u201d Block the Federal Reserve from creating its own digital currency: Central bank digital currencies, known as CBDCs, are a growing trend around the rest of the world, but the idea has received significant pushback from the U.S. cryptoverse. The Fed hasn\u2019t decided whether to make a fully digital version of the U.S. dollar, though it did release a long-awaited report in January 2022 detailing the potential costs and benefits. Trump has spoken out against the idea multiple times in 2024, including at a January campaign rally in New Hampshire, where he called it a \u201cdangerous threat to freedom.\u201d In May, the House passed a bill that would bar the Federal Reserve from creating a CBDC, though the legislation has a long way to go before becoming law.\n\nTrump promoted his latest business venture, World Liberty Financial, on a livestream on X on Sept. 16. Although he didn\u2019t speak about the project himself, his sons and partners discussed it during the stream.\n\nTrump has been promoting the crypto-related venture since August, but its exact purpose remains unclear. No official launch date has been set. The project has been described as a decentralized finance (DeFi) money market, or a platform where people can borrow, lend and earn interest on crypto.\n\nAn earlier white paper for the venture stated that it would feature a new cryptocurrency called $WLFI that would be sold to the public, according to The New York Times.\n\nBottom line\n\nWith millions of dollars at stake, cryptocurrency is a major factor in the 2024 election, influencing both presidential candidates and down-ballot races. While Trump has embraced the crypto crowd with big promises, Harris and the Democrats are playing catch-up. Crypto backers are pouring money into campaigns, aiming to shift regulations in their favor.\n\nAs both parties eye the massive cash flow, the battle over crypto regulation is heating up, making it a key issue to watch in the final weeks leading up to the election.",

        "text": "Allan Lichtman who predicted 9 of the last 10 elections says 2024 pick set off 'avalanche'\nAmericans spent the summer eagerly awaiting two pivotalpolitical statements.\n\nThe first was Taylor Swift\u2019s endorsement of Kamala Harris, who ascended to the top of the Democratic ticket after Joe Biden ended his reelection campaign. Swift formally backed the vice president moments after her debate with Donald Trump, calling her a \u201csteady-handed, gifted leader.\u201d\n\nThe second statement? It wasn\u2019t from another pop star. Instead, some election-watchers waited on pins and needles for a prediction from Allan Lichtman, a 77-year-old distinguished professor of history at American University who lives in Bethesda, Maryland.\n\nThat\u2019s because Lichtman has correctly predicted the outcome of almost every election for decades, except for the race in 2000. He uses a set of 13 \u201ckeys\u201d to make his picks, which range from economic indicators to candidates\u2019 charisma.\n\nAllan Lichtman prediction:Historian who accurately predicted 9 of last 10 presidential elections makes his 2024 pick\n\nHere\u2019s how his model works: If six or more of the keys cut against the party in the White House, they're predicted to lose. Otherwise, Lichtman forecasts the party in power will win again.\n\nLichtman earlier this month predicted Harris would defeat Trump, sending shockwaves among political observers and picking up wall-to-wall news coverage. He told USA TODAY he's received a larger response about his 2024 prediction than ever before.\n\n\u201cMaybe because of how high stakes this election is, and how extraordinary this election is: The sitting president stepping down right before the convention, the challenging candidate convicted of 34 felonies,\u201d Lichtman said.\n\n\u201cThis has been an avalanche.\u201d\n\nWhat are the historian's 13 keys?Allan Lichtman's 2024 election prediction is based on this formula\n\nWhy do Americans love political predictions?\n\nLichtman\u2019s work isn\u2019t your average academic research, and the professor\u2019s publications have drawn attention for years. But is there such a thing as a buttoned-up history professor who becomes an A-list election celebrity every four years?\n\nIf you search Lichtman\u2019s name online, video after video of the professor breaking down his \u201ckeys\u201d and weighing in on the latest election in interviews will flood your feed. You can watch him predict that Trump and his MAGA movement would defeat Hillary Clinton. You can read about his forecast that America would elect its first Black president in 2008.\n\nWhen asked about the response his predictions receive, Lichtman smiles and pauses before simply saying he and his family have been \u201cvery bemused.\u201d\n\n\u201cI've been amazed, in a sense, why they're so interested,\u201d Lichtman said. \u201cThey'll find out soon enough who won or lost, why do they need to know in advance?\u201d\n\nBut why are American politicos so drawn to all election-year predictions \u2013 not just Lichtman\u2019s? The professor said he believes \u201cit has to do with instant gratification.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe live in a society of instant gratification. That's part of it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe other part of it is, we live in a society of predictions. It's not just politics. Look at sports. Sports talk radio is constantly giving you predictions about what's going to happen in upcoming games. Are coaches going to be fired? Who's going to be traded and who isn't?\n\n\u201cIt's entertainment as well. You know, who's going to win the Oscar? When is this couple going to divorce? You know who's going to hook up with whom?\u201d he asked. \"It's everywhere.\"\n\nAfter all, Lichtman says the \"scandal\" key is his favorite of the 13 keys, calling it a much juicer step than weighing economic data or wins and losses in midterm elections.\n\nStill, the professor said a sea of interviews during election years isn't his favorite part about his work. Neither is keynoting conferences or other academic acclaim.\n\n\u201cThe best part of becoming known is when every day people come up to me to say that they admire what I do: security guards at AU, Uber drivers, waiters and waitresses,\u201d Lichtman said.\n\nYes, Allan Lichtman knows about the critics\n\nLichtman is no stranger to criticism. The responses to his picks aren't just questions from media or conversations with D.C.-area voters. This year alone, he said he\u2019s received messages accusing him of being a \u201cDemocratic tool\u201d or being paid by Harris.\n\nBut he\u2019s faced it for years.\n\nLichtman's first prediction was in 1982, when he said Ronald Reagan would win reelection. He developed the model with Vladimir Keilis-Borok, a Russian seismologistwho worked at understanding not elections, but earthquakes.\n\nThe professor explains that the first pushback he received was from fellow forecasters.\n\n\u201cI had committed the cardinal sin of subjectivity. Some of my keys were not just cut and dried statistical indicators like economic growth,\u201d he explained. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018No, it's not subjectivity. It's judgment. We're dealing with human beings. Human beings make judgments all the time.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut as his work picked up steam, criticism also came from political operatives, journalists, pollsters and other analysts outside academic communities. These groups have long launched similar critiques, accusing his keys of being based on the opinions of the person deploying the model instead of static markers.\n\nLichtman\u2019s response? He\u2019d argue that his work does outline specific guidelines for each key. For example, a strong short-term economy doesn\u2019t simply refer to how the person applying the method thinks Americans feel about the economy. Instead, the factor asks whether the economy is in recession during an election campaign.\n\nThe professor still regularly responds to negative feedback online. But he says he tries to remember that, over the years, people have leveled accusations as personal as questioning whether his hair is real. \u201cAs if my hair had anything to do with my predictions,\u201d he said as he pulled on his brown locks to prove their legitimacy.\n\n\u201cBut I have to tell you,\" Lichtman noted. \u201cBeing attacked is not the worst thing that can happen to you. You know what the worst thing is? Being ignored. And I have not been ignored now for a good 20 years.\u201d\n\nLichtman calls it for Kamala Harris\n\nVirtually every major national poll has found the race within its margin of error and too close to call definitively.\n\nButLichtman earlier this month said his keys point to a historic victory for Harris this fall. That\u2019s because she didn\u2019t face a significant primary contest before becoming the Democratic nominee, there is no major third-party candidate after Robert F. Kennedy Jr. ended his presidential bid and Lichtman\u2019s definition for his model\u2019s two economic keys fall in her favor.\n\nHe also said Democrats haven\u2019t faced \u201csustained social unrest.\u201d Lichtman argued the pro-Palestinian protests over Gaza that have rocked parts of the country don\u2019t meet his bar for the key, along with other factors.\n\nIn 2000, Lichtman said eight of the 13 keys could be good news for Democrats, though Al Gore ultimately lost the race to George W. Bush after a protracted fight that ended up at the Supreme Court.\n\nLichtman did raise some eyebrows in June after he said Democrats shouldn\u2019t drop Biden, even after the president's disastrous debate performance, which sparked an uproar and lead to the end of his campaign.\n\nBut the professor explained that he thought Democrats were risking losing two keys as questions about Biden's reelection campaign grew: The power of incumbency and the role that primary contests can play. With Biden dropping out, Democrats sacrificed the immediate name recognition and other advantages that have long come with running for reelection.\n\nBut Harris didn't face the typical primary process for the Democratic nomination and didn't have to battle other politicians, so the left managed to salvage that component of Lichtman's model.\n\nAnd no, in case you were wondering, the recent Harris-Trump debate and the second assassination attempt targeting the former president don\u2019t change anything.\n\n\u201cNone of these ephemeral events, not the debate, not the purported attempted assassination, not JD Vance saying he made up a story about immigrants eating cats and dogs,\u201d Lichtman said. \u201cNone of that changes the fundamentals of the election. So none of it changes my prediction.\u201dRelated embed (ID: 75293683007)\n\nPolitical predictions ... and a senior Olympics?\n\nElections aren\u2019t the only races Lichtman knows about.\n\nHe\u2019s been a runner for 60 years, beginning when he was 16 and extending to today. He recently notched his own victories at the Maryland Senior Olympics, picking up bronze and gold medals and qualifying for next year\u2019s national competition.\n\nHis wife, Karyn Strickler, is a triathlete, and the couple has long enjoyed playing basketball together. Lichtman explained that when the two used to play what was supposed to be a friendly game, their friends would remark \u201cwhen Allan and Karyn play one-on-one, there's blood on the floor.\u201d\n\nStill, theirs is a family deeply interested in politics. Strickler is the founder and president of Vote Climate U.S. PAC, which \"works to elect candidates to eliminate all human-made, greenhouse gas emissions by 2050,\" according to its website. Lichtman hosts a regular live show on YouTube talking about politics with his son, Sam.\n\nLichtman gave USA TODAY one more reason he \u2013 and Americans from coast to coast \u2013 might be so interested in political predictions.\n\n\u201cIt's fun. It's interesting. I've been doing this for 40 years. I'm 77. I still get butterflies in my stomach every four years because I can be proved wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course, I could be wrong. Anyone could be wrong.\u201d\n\nContributing: Karissa Waddick, Elizabeth Beyer",

        "summary": " A Pew Research Center survey of 9,720 U.S. adults conducted Aug. 26-Sept. 2, 2024 . Majority of Americans continue to favor moving away from Electoral College . Roughly a third favor retaining the Electoral College system, according to the survey .",
        "text": "Majority of Americans continue to favor moving away from Electoral College\nAs has been the case for over 200 years, the Electoral College will determine the outcome of the U.S. presidential race this fall. Yet most Americans have long supported moving away from this system.\n\nHow we did this In 2000 and 2016, the winners of the popular vote lost their bids for U.S. president after receiving fewer Electoral College votes than their opponents. To continue tracking how the public views the U.S. system for presidential elections, we surveyed 9,720 U.S. adults from Aug. 26 to Sept. 2, 2024. Everyone who took part in the current survey is a member of Pew Research Center\u2019s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. This way nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. Read more about the ATP\u2019s methodology. Here are the questions used for this analysis, along with responses, and its methodology.\n\nThe Electoral College allocates a number of electors based on how many senators and representatives each state has in Congress (plus three electors for the District of Columbia, for a total of 538). Most states award all of their electoral votes to the candidate who wins that state.\n\nMore than six-in-ten Americans (63%) would instead prefer to see the winner of the presidential election be the person who wins the most votes nationally. Roughly a third (35%) favor retaining the Electoral College system, according to a Pew Research Center survey of 9,720 adults conducted Aug. 26-Sept. 2, 2024.\n\nThe Electoral College is always in focus during presidential elections. But a recent \u2013 as yet unsuccessful \u2013 effort to change how Nebraska awards its electoral votes has highlighted the prospect of a narrow Electoral College victory for either candidate in an extremely close race.\n\nRelated: In Tied Presidential Race, Harris and Trump Have Contrasting Strengths, Weaknesses\n\nAs has been the case for more than two decades, there are wide partisan differences in attitudes about the Electoral College:\n\nEight-in-ten Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents favor replacing the Electoral College with a popular vote system.\n\nRepublicans and Republican leaners are more evenly divided: 53% favor keeping the Electoral College, while 46% would prefer to replace it.\n\nFocus on the Electoral College\n\nIn 48 states and D.C., the candidate who receives the most votes in that state is awarded all of its electoral votes.\n\nNebraska and Maine have a different approach, allocating two electoral votes to the candidate who wins the most votes statewide and one to the winner of each congressional district. Some Republicans have been pressing to change Nebraska\u2019s rules so that the statewide winner gets all five of its electoral votes. This would likely work to former President Donald Trump\u2019s advantage, given Nebraska\u2019s consistent support of GOP presidential candidates.\n\nA candidate must win a majority of the 538 electoral votes to become president. If no candidate wins a majority, the election outcome is decided by the U.S. House of Representatives, with each state\u2019s delegation casting one vote.\n\nUnder the current electoral system in the United States, the winner of the popular vote may not secure enough Electoral College votes to win the presidency.\n\nThis occurred in both the 2000 and 2016 elections. George W. Bush and Donald Trump, respectively, won these elections with clear Electoral College victories, but they did not win the most votes nationwide.\n\nIn 2020, while President Joe Biden won the popular vote by more than 7 million votes, his Electoral College victory was decided by fewer than 50,000 votes in a few close states.\n\nAs a result of the Electoral College system, there is outsize attention to outcomes in a handful of battleground states. This year, those battlegrounds include Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nPartisan views of the Electoral College over time\n\nSince the 2000 election, two-thirds or more Democrats have backed moving to a popular vote system.\n\nRepublicans remain fairly divided today, with 46% in favor of moving to a popular vote system.\n\nRepublicans were less supportive of this change following Trump\u2019s 2016 win. In November of that year, in the wake of Trump\u2019s Electoral College victory and popular vote loss, just 27% of Republicans supported a popular vote system.\n\nParty and ideology\n\nThere are only modest differences by ideology on this question among Democrats:\n\n87% of liberal Democrats and 74% of conservative and moderate Democrats say they would prefer presidents to be elected by popular vote.\n\nIdeological differences are wider among Republicans:\n\n63% of conservative Republicans prefer keeping the current system.\n\nIn contrast, 61% of moderate and liberal Republicans (who are a much smaller share of the Republican coalition) say they support a popular vote for president.\n\nAge\n\nMajorities across all age groups support changing the system. However, adults younger than 50 are somewhat more supportive of this than those ages 50 and older (66% vs. 59%).\n\nNote: This is an update of a post previously published in 2021, 2022 and 2023.",

        "text": "In a US presidential election with razor-thin margins, will \u2018couch-sitters\u2019 decide who wins?\nIn countries with compulsory voting, such as Australia and many in Latin America, the system usually ensures an overwhelming majority of voters cast their ballots election after election.\n\nIn the United States, it\u2019s a very different story. Two-thirds of eligible voters turned out to vote in the 2020 presidential election \u2013 the highest rate since 1900. Turnout in presidential elections before 2020 tended to hover between 50% and 65%.\n\nOften, it\u2019s the voters choosing to stay home on the couch who effectively decide an election\u2019s outcome.\n\nUnder the United States\u2019 unusual Electoral College presidential voting system, the candidate who wins the most votes nationally does not necessarily win the election. Twice in the past 25 years, Democrats have won the popular vote in the presidential race and still lost the election. That includes Donald Trump\u2019s win over Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\nAs such, victory depends on getting more voters \u201coff the couch\u201d in key battleground states where the decisive Electoral College votes are up for grabs. In those states, it doesn\u2019t matter what percentage of people show up to vote, or how much a candidate wins by, it is winner take all.\n\nA voter who doesn\u2019t vote, therefore, actually makes an active choice \u2014 they remove a vote from the candidate they would have likely chosen, and so give an important advantage to the person they would not have voted for.\n\nThe \u201ccouch\u201d is effectively where Americans go to vote against their self-interest.\n\nEric Gay/AP\n\nWho is more incentivised to vote?\n\nAs this year\u2019s presidential election between Trump and Kamala Harris approaches, we ask a simple question: whose \u201ccouch\u201d will decide one of the most consequential elections in living memory?\n\nRecent research demonstrates that partisanship is an important driver of voter choice in presidential elections.\n\nThe fact that the US is deeply divided is not news to most, but current survey data show how evenly split along partisan lines it actually is. With about 30% of Americans identifying as a Republican and 30% identifying as a Democrat, there is virtually no difference in the total number of voters who support each major party.\n\nThe remaining 40% of Americans identify as \u201cindependent\u201d \u2013 that is, not loyal to either major political party. Almost seven decades of research on the American voter shows, however, that independents heavily \u201clean\u201d towards one party or the other, with about half leaning Republican and the other half leaning Democrat.\n\nOne possible insight into which group has greater incentive to vote is polling on people\u2019s dissatisfaction with their party\u2019s candidate.\n\nAccording to the most recent Gallup Poll data, 9% of Republicans currently have an unfavourable opinion of Trump. In contrast, only 5% of Democrats have an unfavourable opinion of Harris.\n\nPartisan voters who are dissatisfied with their party candidate have a massive incentive to \u201cstay on the couch\u201d and refrain from voting. They don\u2019t really want to vote for \u201cthe other team\u201d, but they can\u2019t stand their own team anymore either.\n\nFor example, Republican women in the suburbs, veterans and traditional Republicans have started to abandon Trump over his stances on reproductive rights and national security, and his temperament. The Trump campaign clearly knows this. At a rally in New York a few days ago, he told attendees to \u201cget your fat ass out of the couch\u201d to go vote for him.\n\nShould these disaffected Republican and Republican-leaning voters stay home on November 5, Harris may well have a decisive edge over Trump.\n\nShawn Thew/EPA\n\nWhen the couch wins, America loses\n\nIn 2016, Trump defied the polls and traditional voter turn-out trends by convincing some disaffected, working-class Democrats to stay on the couch, vote for an unelectable third party candidate or, in some cases, vote for him.\n\nCould this happen again? Or will Democrats be able to reverse this phenomenon by getting exhausted Republicans suffering Trump fatigue to stay home, while motivating everyone from Taylor Swift fans to \u201cnever Trumpers\u201d to veterans of foreign wars to get out to vote.\n\nRecent trends suggest overall turnout will be comparatively high, in line with the past three federal US elections.\n\nDemocrats have traditionally benefited from higher voter turn-out, but it is not as clear this is still the case in 2024. Recent research shows higher turnout rates seem to have favoured the Republican Party since 2016.\n\nYet both parties still have significant numbers of people who don\u2019t vote. According to the Pew Research Center, 46% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents didn\u2019t vote in the past three elections (2018, 2020 and 2022), compared to the 41% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents.\n\nSo again, who sits on the couch matters. Inevitably, many of those who stay home will get precisely what they don\u2019t want. When the couch wins, America loses.",

        "text": "Do Polls Really Matter?\nIn the home stretch of the 2024 presidential election, a new poll dominates the headlines almost every day. But one thing remains consistent: It looks like an extremely tight race.\n\nBut just how much do polls really matter?\n\nWe asked Fordham\u2019s resident expert, Monika McDermott, Ph.D., a professor of political science who studies voting behavior, political psychology, and public opinion. She has been an election night analyst for CBS News since 2002 and works as a campaign and polling consultant in the U.S. and abroad.\n\n\u201cWhether polling matters depends on the purpose for which people intend to use it,\u201d she said. \u201cFor campaigns, political polling is extremely valuable in formulating messaging and determining weaknesses and strengths of the candidate.\u201d\n\nMcDermott explained that some things pollsters ask about\u2014such as issues and priorities\u2014provide great insight into the race. But most media outlets choose to ignore those questions in favor of the electoral horse race: which candidate is ahead and by how many points. \u201cFor that purpose, polls aren\u2019t great,\u201d she said.\n\nHow accurate are polls at predicting who will win?\n\nPolls only provide a snapshot in time. The numbers are only good at the moment they\u2019re measured. As we say in polling and elections, the only poll that counts is the one on Election Day.\n\nHow do pollsters decide who to poll?\n\nPolls used to be done using random samples of telephone numbers. Since the advent of cell phones, things have changed. Now, many polls are based on volunteer opt-in panels of respondents. So they only measure the opinions of people who have chosen to be included. This means that while polling can still approximate a \u201crepresentative\u201d sample of Americans, most polling no longer relies on the original statistical assumptions behind random sampling. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they aren\u2019t good and useful, but it is a different animal.\n\nHow much do poll results influence campaign strategy?\n\nIn my experience, polling is extremely valuable in determining issue priorities and messaging for the candidate to best persuade the voters they need on their side. They can also point out weaknesses in an opponent\u2019s campaigning and positions, which is also useful.\n\nWhat are the gold standard surveys?\n\nIn my personal opinion, the most reliable surveys come from organizations that are trying to recruit their respondent pool based on random sampling. It\u2019s a blend of old and new methods and avoids the purely opt-in effect. The National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago, which does polling for the Associated Press, among other organizations, does this, and they are the closest to the pure science of sampling.\n\nCampaign polls that use registered voter lists are actually also reliable, as they want to talk only to voters. Media organizations don\u2019t do this because they frequently would rather be able to talk about the American public at large.\n\nWhy were the polls so wrong in 2016?\n\n2016 was not the polling disaster that people like to think it was. The national polls were dead-on. [Hillary] Clinton won the popular vote (by a point or two, which was the prediction), which is all that national polls are designed to measure. They are not representative of the electoral college vote and that\u2019s what decides the election.\n\nThe problem in 2016 came from estimates from state polls. State polls are notoriously hard to do. Only experts in that region know the ins and outs that are special to that state\u2019s politics and electorates.",

Lichtman, who has successfully forecasted almost every presidential election since 1984 using his \"13 keys\" model, said, \"We are going to have a new, path-breaking president.\" Harris, if elected, would be the first Asian American and Black woman to hold the office.Lichtman\u2019s prediction, however, doesn\u2019t imply that Harris will have an easy path to victory. While his model suggests a Harris win, many national polls still show the race within the margin of error, making it difficult to predict a definitive outcome. Lichtman acknowledged this uncertainty but emphasized the strengths of his model: \"We're no longer a white person's country,\" he said during his interview with Times Now Digital. He highlighted the shifting demographics of the US, which he believes will play a significant role in the upcoming election.Lichtman\u2019s prediction model, created with Russian seismologist Vladimir Keilis-Borok, is based on 13 \"keys\" that assess the political and economic climate. The model is simple in principle: if six or more of the keys go against the party in power, that party is likely to lose. The keys include factors like incumbency, foreign and domestic policy successes, economic indicators, and social unrest Lichtman believes that for the 2024 race, the keys favor Harris. \"None of these ephemeral events, not the debate, not the purported attempted assassination, not JD Vance saying he made up a story about immigrants eating cats and dogs \u2026 None of that changes the fundamentals of the election. So none of it changes my prediction,\u201d he told USA Today.Kamala Harris\u2019s 2024 campaign also received a major endorsement from pop icon Taylor Swift. Swift formally backed Harris shortly after the vice president\u2019s debate with Donald Trump, calling her a \u201csteady-handed, gifted leader.\u201d While celebrity endorsements like this don't affect Lichtman\u2019s 13 keys model , they can shape public perception and potentially influence voter turnout.Lichtman explained that Harris\u2019s path to becoming the Democratic nominee was another factor working in her favor. She did not face a significant primary contest, which often weakens a candidate. Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s decision to drop out of the race also removed a potential third-party candidate that could have disrupted the election.According to Lichtman, other factors, such as the Democrats not facing \u201csustained social unrest,\u201d contribute to Harris's advantage. While pro-Palestinian protests over Gaza have rocked parts of the country, Lichtman argued they don\u2019t meet the threshold for his \u201csocial unrest\u201d key. This specific key was crucial in some past elections but is not a major factor this time around.Lichtman\u2019s political predictions have consistently drawn national attention because of their accuracy. Since he began making them in 1982, Lichtman has correctly predicted the outcome of almost every US presidential race, with the exception of the 2000 contest between Al Gore and George W. Bush, which was ultimately decided by the Supreme Court. His predictions rely heavily on historical and political patterns, which many analysts find difficult to argue with.In discussing his prediction for 2024, Lichtman noted the unprecedented nature of the election: \"Maybe because of how high stakes this election is, and how extraordinary this election is: The sitting president stepping down right before the convention, the challenging candidate convicted of 34 felonies,\" he told USA Today. He added, \u201cThis has been an avalanche.\u201dLichtman\u2019s involvement in politics extends beyond his predictions. He is a historian and professor at American University, where he has spent years studying US politics and elections. His first foray into political forecasting came in 1982, when he predicted that Ronald Reagan would win re-election. Since then, his model has correctly forecasted the victories of Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and Donald Trump, among others.His predictions have not always been met with unanimous praise. Lichtman has faced criticism from political analysts and forecasters who argue that his \"keys\" are too subjective. He defends his method by stating that \"we're dealing with human beings. Human beings make judgments all the time.\" Over time, however, Lichtman\u2019s predictions have earned him respect, even from his critics, due to his high accuracy rate.Reflecting on why his predictions draw so much attention, Lichtman noted society\u2019s desire for instant answers. \u201cWe live in a society of instant gratification. That's part of it,\u201d he explained to USA Today. He also compared political forecasting to predictions in sports and entertainment, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s not just politics. Look at sports. Sports talk radio is constantly giving you predictions about what's going to happen in upcoming games. It\u2019s entertainment as well.\"As the US heads toward the 2024 election, Lichtman\u2019s prediction of Kamala Harris\u2019s victory has captured the attention of political observers. While national polls remain close, Lichtman\u2019s \"13 keys\" suggest that Harris is on track to win. With her unique candidacy and support from figures like Taylor Swift, Harris may indeed make history as the first Asian American and Black woman president of the United States. For now, the world waits to see if Lichtman\u2019s prediction will once again prove accurate.",

        "text": "Trump briefed on alleged assassination threats from Iran\nIntelligence officials have warned Republican presidential candidate of \u2018real and specific threats from Iran\u2019, according to his campaign.\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump has claimed \u201cbig threats\u201d on his life after his US intelligence briefing on alleged threats from Iran to assassinate him.\n\nThe former United States president said on his Truth Social platform on Wednesday that \u201cthe entire US military is watching and waiting\u201d.\n\n\u201cMoves were already made by Iran that didn\u2019t work out, but they will try again \u2026 I am surrounded by more men, guns, and weapons than I have ever seen before,\u201d he said.\n\nHis campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said in a statement on Tuesday that Trump was warned by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) \u201cregarding real and specific threats from Iran to assassinate him in an effort to destabilize and sow chaos in the United States\u201d.\n\n\u201cIntelligence officials have identified that these continued and coordinated attacks have heightened in the past few months,\u201d Cheung said.\n\nLaw enforcement officials were working to ensure Trump was protected and the November 5 presidential election was free from interference, he added.\n\nIran has previously denied Washington\u2019s claims of interfering in US affairs. Iran\u2019s permanent mission to the United Nations in New York did not respond to a request by the Reuters news agency for comment late on Tuesday.\n\nAn ODNI spokesperson acknowledged the briefing on Tuesday but declined to address any specifics, Reuters said.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if the threats referred to by the campaign and Trump himself were new or threats that had previously been reported.\n\nTrump last month accused Iran of hacking his campaign, with his team alleging the Iranian government was stealing and distributing sensitive internal documents without providing evidence. The allegations came after Microsoft issued a report detailing foreign attempts to interfere in this year\u2019s US election campaign.\n\nJuly shooting\n\nIran rejected accusations that it was trying to kill Trump two months ago, shortly after a gunman opened fire at a rally in Pennsylvania, killing one person and wounding the presidential contender.\n\nDays after the July 13 assassination attempt, US media reported that authorities had received intelligence on an alleged Iranian plot against the Republican, prompting his protection to be boosted. Iran rejected the \u201cmalicious\u201d accusations.\n\nSeparately, earlier this month, a Pakistani man with alleged ties to Iran pleaded not guilty to charges stemming from an alleged plot to assassinate Trump in retaliation for the 2020 killing by the US of Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani. Trump was president at the time and ordered the attack.\n\nThe defendant named Trump as a potential target but had not conceived the scheme as a plan to assassinate the former president, according to a person familiar with the matter cited by Reuters.\n\nFederal authorities are separately investigating an apparent assassination attempt on Trump at his Florida golf course in mid-September. There has been no indication of Iranian involvement.",

In the first attempt, authorities shot and killed the gunman who shot Trump and arrested the suspect at the scene in the second.\n\nBut U.S. officials have long been concerned about Iran, which they see as a threat to both Trump and former Trump administration officials and have accused of trying to interfere in the U.S. presidential election.\n\nIn July, authorities said they had received word of an Iranian threat on Trump\u2019s life and boosted security for the candidate as a result. The following month a Pakistani man alleged to have links to Iran was charged in a plot to carry out political assassinations on U.S. soil. Law enforcement did not name the targets of the alleged plot, but legal filings suggest Trump was a potential target.\n\nIranian hackers also stole information from Trump\u2019s campaign and sought, unsuccessfully, to interest news organizations and President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign in the material. There\u2019s no indication that any of the recipients responded.\n\nAlong with Russia and China, Iran has also mounted an extensive online influence operation designed to stoke discord and polarization ahead of the November election, intelligence officials have said. Iran also opposes Trump\u2019s reelection, seeing him as the candidate more likely to increase tension between Washington and Tehran.\n\nTrump\u2019s administration ended a nuclear deal with Iran, reimposed sanctions and ordered the killing of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, an act that prompted Iran\u2019s leaders to vow revenge.\n\nSpeaking on CBS This Morning, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said authorities have been tracking Iran\u2019s threats against \u201ca number of senior officials\u201d including Trump as well as people now serving in the Biden administration.\n\n\u201cThis is something we\u2019ve been tracking very intensely for a long time,\u201d Blinken said.\n\nIn 2022, an Iranian operative was charged in a plot to murder former National Security Advisor John Bolton in presumed retaliation for a U.S. airstrike that killed Soleimani.\n\nThe Secret Service did not respond to requests for information about new threats against Trump and whether they had recently beefed up security for the campaign in response. But the agency has already said publicly that since the July 13 assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, the former president is receiving the highest levels of protection the agency can provide.\n\nAssociated Press writer Rebecca Santana contributed to this report.",

It now heads to President Joe Biden, who plans to sign it well before the Tuesday shutdown deadline. Both chambers are set to adjourn this week for a lengthy recess and will not return to Washington until after the Nov. 5 election.\n\nThe package, negotiated by House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and top Democrats, would fund the government at current levels through Dec. 20, setting up another spending fight right before the holidays. It would also provide $231 million in additional money for the Secret Service, including for operations related to the presidential campaign, in the wake of two apparent attempts to assassinate Trump.\n\nSpeaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-La., speaks with reporters as he walks from his office to the House Chamber at the U.S. Capitol on Sept. 25, 2024. Kent Nishimura / Getty Images\n\nTrump has publicly insisted that congressional Republicans shut down the government unless they can enact the proof-of-citizenship election legislation, known as the SAVE Act, even though it\u2019s already illegal and rare for noncitizens to vote in federal elections.\n\nBut after the House rejected a package that combined government funding and the SAVE Act last week, Johnson stripped out the Trump-backed election legislation and brought the new, mostly clean spending bill to the floor. Defending the move, Johnson and other key Republicans have argued a GOP-led shutdown just 35 days before Election Day would amount to \u201cpolitical malpractice.\u201d\n\nJohnson denied he\u2019s \u201cdefying Trump\u201d over the voting legislation, arguing that they have been in close contact throughout the funding fight and that they both believe the SAVE Act is critical to ensuring election integrity.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not defying President Trump. I\u2019ve spoken with him at great length, and he is very frustrated about the situation. His concern is election security, and it is mine, as well. It is all of ours,\u201d Johnson told reporters Tuesday.\n\nHe blamed Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., for failing to take up the SAVE Act as a stand-alone measure in the Senate. \u201cWe passed the SAVE Act in the summer, and it\u2019s been sitting on Chuck Schumer\u2019s desk collecting dust; that is maddening to us,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cPresident Trump understands the current dilemma in the situation that we\u2019re in, and so there\u2019s no daylight between us.\u201d\n\nOnce signed into law, the stopgap bill will set up another shutdown battle in the postelection lame duck session, but with the benefit of both parties knowing the balance of power next year.\n\n\u201cI think the vast, vast majority of Congress does not want a shutdown,\u201d said Sen. John Boozman, R-Ark. \u201cSo let\u2019s get through the election and decide what we want to do.\u201d\n\nThe short-term funding bill, known as a continuing resolution, or CR, required two-thirds support to pass in the House because it came to the floor under an expedited process known as \u201csuspension of the rules.\u201d That was needed because conservatives on the Johnson-aligned Rules Committee refused to help advance the package through the committee.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same kicking the can down the road,\u201d lamented Rep. Dan Bishop, R-N.C., a member of the far-right Freedom Caucus who opposed the CR.\n\nRather than blame Johnson, former Freedom Caucus Chairman Scott Perry, R-Pa., pointed the finger at Senate Democrats, who didn\u2019t pass any of the 12 annual government funding bills for the new fiscal year.\n\n\u201cYou always blame all this stuff on us, but the Senate has put zero appropriations bills on the floor. Zero,\u201d Perry said. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to have a dance partner, and our partner refuses to show up.\u201d\n\nSchumer said he\u2019s pleased that the House GOP learned that \u201cpartisan bully tactics\u201d don\u2019t work on funding measures while chiding them for wasting time.\n\n\"There will be no shutdown, because finally, at the end of the day, our Republican colleagues in the House decided to work with us. ... I hope the House will have learned its lesson that once again, listening to the hard right on these vital issues \u2014 to funding the government, to avoiding default \u2014 cannot lead to anything that is useful or constructive,\" Schumer said before the vote Wednesday. \"In fact, I hope this positive outcome of bipartisanship can set the tone for more constructive bipartisan work when we return in the fall.\"",

        "text": "If Trump wins the election, he could launch a \u2018catastrophic\u2019 rollback of LGBTQ+ rights\nThis is the first part of the standfirst This is the second part of the standfirst Headline what's at stake?\n\nView image in fullscreen Photograph: Erik McGregor/Guardian Design / LightRocket via Getty Images\n\nOne morning in February, 16-year-old Levi Hormuth took off school, his parents called out of work, and the three began a five and a half hour drive.\n\nThe purpose of the 350-mile trip from their home in St Charles county, Missouri, to Chicago, Illinois, was a routine doctor\u2019s appointment.\n\nLevi, a transgender boy, now 17 and in his final year of high school, had been a patient at the Washington University (WashU) Transgender Center since he was 13. The center, a short drive from home, had helped Levi in his transition, providing counseling and eventually hormone treatments at age 15. The testosterone had profoundly positive impacts, Levi and his parents said, helping him overcome significant mental distress stemming from his gender dysphoria.\n\nBut in June 2023, Missouri\u2019s Republican governor enacted a bill banning gender-affirming healthcare for youth under 18. The law had an exception for youth like Levi who were already accessing the care, but WashU, fearing legal liability, stopped prescribing medications to all trans youth.\n\nThe best alternative for Levi and his family was to cross state lines.\n\n\u201cThe fact that I have to drive five hours both ways for treatment just shows our government in Missouri doesn\u2019t care about things that are actually important,\u201d Levi said one afternoon, sitting on his backyard deck with his parents in St Charles county, which is more conservative than neighboring St Louis county. \u201cWe have potholes galore that should be fixed, we have horrible crime rates. It\u2019s enraging that they\u2019re not focusing on what matters and listening to our voices.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Becky Hormuth and Levi Hormuth, 17, both of St Charles, pose for a portrait on 1 May 2024 at Park-Like in Grand Center Arts District, Missouri. Photograph: Eric Lee/St Louis Public Radio, Guardian Design\n\nThe stakes of the presidential election are enormous for people like Levi and the broader LGBTQ+ community.\n\nDonald Trump has promised aggressive attacks on LGBTQ+ rights, with a focus on trans youth, who have been a central target of the GOP\u2019s culture war. The former president\u2019s proposed \u201cplan to protect children from left-wing gender insanity\u201d includes ordering federal agencies to end all programs that \u201cpromote \u2026 gender transition at any age\u201d; revoking funding from hospitals that provide gender-affirming care to youth and subjecting them to US justice department investigations; punishing schools that affirm trans youth; and pushing a federal law stating the government doesn\u2019t legally recognize trans people.\n\nTrump has also pledged to rescind federal LGBTQ+ nondiscrimination policies, which could mean a loss of protections in housing, healthcare, employment, education and a range of federal programs. He has promised new credentialing for teachers to \u201cpromote positive education about the nuclear family, the roles of mothers and fathers\u201d. The Republican platform calls for advancing a \u201cculture that values the sanctity of marriage\u201d.\n\nProject 2025, the rightwing manifesto authored by Trump allies, is even more explicit, saying Biden-Harris pro-LGBTQ+ policies should be replaced by ones supporting the \u201cformation of stable, married, nuclear families\u201d and \u201cheterosexual, intact marriage\u201d. It says adoption agencies, healthcare workers and businesses should be able to reject LGBTQ+ people, and faith-based government contractors should be allowed to deny services to people who don\u2019t fit \u201cbiblically based\u201d definitions of marriage.\n\nSome legal scholars have warned that marriage equality, already endangered at the supreme court, could be further threatened under Trump, particularly if he gets the opportunity to appoint additional justices.\n\nView image in fullscreen Becky, Levi and Kyle Hormuth at a St Louis Pride event. Photograph: Guardian Design / Courtesy of Becky Hormuth\n\n\u201cIt is terrifying to think about our government actively, strategically and intentionally coming for our community in every aspect of our lives,\u201d said Cathy Renna, communications director of the National LGBTQ Task Force Action Fund, a national rights group. \u201cThese attempts to erase our community would have just absolutely devastating impacts.\u201d\n\n\u2018It\u2019s life and death\u2019\n\nIf elected, Trump is expected to weaponize the US government to authorize, encourage and mandate widespread anti-LGBTQ+ discrimination.\n\nIn his first term, Trump banned trans people from the military, and Project 2025 calls for the policy\u2019s reinstatement. The Republican presidential nominee is also likely to assert that employers\u2019 \u201creligious beliefs\u201d provide a lawful justification for firing LGBTQ+ workers, either through an executive order or regulations, the ACLU recently warned.\n\nLGBTQ+ people could also be denied housing under a new Trump term, which could see a return to his efforts to exclude trans people from homeless shelters, said Sarah Kate Ellis, CEO of Glaad: \u201cEverything is at risk for us in the election \u2013 our workplace, our relationships, our families, our marriages, education, our housing.\u201d\n\nAdvocates fear Trump\u2019s anti-LGBTQ+ agenda would undo the Biden administration\u2019s foster care regulations meant to ensure queer and trans youth are placed in supportive homes. Brandon Wolf, press secretary of the Human Rights Campaign, a national LGBTQ+ group, said that rollback would endanger kids\u2019 lives, noting survey data suggesting half of trans and non-binary youth have considered suicide. He recalled being a teenager in Oregon when the state banned gay marriage and how that emboldened his classmates\u2019 homophobia\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to be a young person when your president is demeaning, demoralizing and dehumanizing members of your community,\u201d Wolf said, \u201cand Trump would be catastrophic\u201d.\n\nView image in fullscreen (Left to right) Kyle and Levi Hormuth at the Missouri capitol in Jefferson City in 2023 protesting the ban on gender-affirming healthcare. Photograph: Guardian Design / Courtesy of Becky Hormuth\n\nProject 2025 further equates trans-inclusive reading materials to \u201cpornography\u201d, suggesting teachers and librarians should be imprisoned as sex offenders if they promote \u201ctransgender ideology\u201d. This would probably require a law from Congress, but the push echoes GOP state bills across the country seeking to criminalize drag art and gender nonconformity. And Trump himself has increasingly spread blatant misinformation fearmongering about trans kids\u2019 healthcare.\n\nBeyond explicit attacks on LGBTQ+ rights, advocates fear the politicization of federal public health agencies could impede critical research and HIV prevention efforts. \u201cThe support we get from the federal government, while it might not be enough, is what\u2019s keeping some people alive,\u201d said Dwayne Kwaysee Wright, a director of DEI initiatives at George Washington University. \u201cSo the stakes are no more than life or death.\u201d\n\nAlexander Chen, founding director of Harvard Law\u2019s LGBTQ+ advocacy clinic, who previously helped challenge the trans military ban, said a second Trump term could be \u201cmuch more dangerous\u201d than his first. As president, Trump introduced some of his most extreme policies in a chaotic, brash manner \u2013 including via tweets, with little thought to legality or implementation \u2013 resulting in successful court challenges. With support from conservative groups like Project 2025, Trump 2.0 could be significantly more strategic and effective if he returns to the White House.\n\nKamala Harris has not released detailed LGBTQ+ rights policies, but her platform says she would fight to pass the Equality Act, which would enshrine LGBTQ+ protections into law. As a California prosecutor, she was an early champion of marriage equality, but had a mixed record on trans rights; she has since earned support from some prominent trans advocates and major LGBTQ+ groups.\n\nThe ACLU has urged Harris to build on Biden\u2019s legacy and fight to protect LGBTQ+ people from state attacks on their rights and expand access to trans healthcare in federal programs.\n\nA Trump spokesperson declined to comment on specific policies, and said in an email: \u201cPresident Trump will implement policies that uplifts ALL Americans, regardless of race, gender, or sexual orientation.\u201d The Harris campaign did not respond to inquiries.\n\n\u2018This could break me\u2019\n\nMissouri, a national leader in anti-trans policy, offers a window into the hostile climate Trump and his allies seek to expand. It is one of 26 states that have restricted gender-affirming healthcare, affecting an estimated 118,300 trans kids ages 13 to 17.\n\nStudies have found that care is linked to improved mental health. But in recent years, there\u2019s been a growing movement to criminalize those treatments for trans youth, pushed by the same groups promoting anti-abortion laws forcing patients to cross state lines for procedures.\n\nSixteen Democratic-run states and Washington DC have pushed back, adopting \u201csanctuary\u201d laws protecting gender-affirming care, according to Elana Redfield, federal policy director at UCLA\u2019s Williams Institute. \u201cThere\u2019s evidence it\u2019s beneficial for trans people to get this care, so to have it rapidly restricted is likely very distressing,\u201d she said.\n\nLevi, the St Charles teenager, was isolated and detached before he transitioned, his parents recalled. He didn\u2019t want to go out in public. He\u2019d have meltdowns and remain balled up in his closet. He struggled with self harm. Once he expressed his identity and the family met with experts who helped them understand gender dysphoria, \u201che came out of his shell and became a totally different person, a joyous person, a really fun kid,\u201d said Becky Hormuth, his mother, who is a teacher. \u201cIt\u2019s unimaginable to think he can be this joyous when the entire world is pretty much attacking his existence.\u201d\n\nKyle Hormuth, Levi\u2019s father, who works in healthcare, said when it became clear gender-affirming treatment could help address his son\u2019s suicidality, \u201cwe jumped right on board. I\u2019ll support my children no matter what because I\u2019d much rather have my child in my life than not in my life. I want my kids to live and thrive and be what they want to be.\u201d\n\nAfter Missouri\u2019s ban passed, Becky got Levi on a waitlist for a Chicago clinic, but for months it was unclear if he\u2019d be accepted \u201cThat\u2019s when I really started to spiral into a panic\u201d, he recalled.\n\nShe started rationing Levi\u2019s treatments. It was a relief once they got into Chicago, but the travel was exhausting. Levi had to cross into Illinois again weeks after his first visit to do bloodwork, which was required to be done within the state.\n\nLosing access to testosterone wasn\u2019t an option, Levi said, his eyes welling with tears: \u201cAfter all of this holding myself together, that would probably be the thing that breaks me.\u201d He said he recognized some people were uninformed about trans identities:. \u201cPeople fear what they cannot understand.\u201d But he was fed up with those in power unwilling to learn. \u201cHow am I supposed to talk to you if you aren\u2019t going to listen?\u201d\n\nBecky said the constant attacks on their rights had caused great anxiety. \u201cWhen I\u2019m at a store, I scan the room and wonder, are you a hateful person? Are you someone who thinks vile things about my family and the community I advocate for?\u201d\n\nThe Hormuths have considered leaving Missouri, but Levi wanted to stay in his school to support younger LGBTQ+ kids.\n\nYounger trans kids are particularly vulnerable if Trump is re-elected.\n\nWilliam, an 11-year-old trans boy in St Louis, was adamant about his gender from a young age, said his mother, Marie, who asked to use their middle names to protect their privacy. Just before he turned seven, the two heard a radio segment about a trans woman who was killed, prompting her to explain anti-trans discrimination.\n\n\u201cHis takeaway was: \u2018That is how I feel. I think I\u2019m trans. Does that mean I\u2019m going to get killed, too?\u2019\u201d Marie recalled. She was glad the conversation gave him language to express himself, but regretted the fear it instilled. Once he spoke openly about being a boy, the depression he\u2019d been suffering dissipated. \u201cHe said, \u2018I just feel so much better.\u2019 He was bouncing off the walls like a balloon, so happy and free.\u201d\n\nWilliam had a supportive gender-affirming healthcare team, which was on track to prescribe puberty blockers after years of living as a boy \u2013 until the GOP criminalized this treatment. \u201cIt\u2019s terrifying and extremely stressful,\u201d said Marie, who eventually got William seen at a clinic in Peoria, Illinois, two and a half hours away. But that facility didn\u2019t offer prescriptions he needed, forcing her to seek an appointment in Chicago. \u201cI keep having to start all over,\u201d said Marie.\n\nSeated with his mother outside the food business she runs one afternoon, William was cheerful, talking about how popular he was at summer camp, his love of sleepovers, his plans to swim with dolphins, his dreams of being a baseball announcer and how he chose his name based on his first crush. \u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing but I was so young and mindless then,\u201d he admitted.\n\nHe said he didn\u2019t mind the drive to Peoira, because his mom got him doughnuts. He knows they may have to go to Chicago next. \u201cMy mom\u2019s gonna feel bad, so I\u2019ll get to stay in a hotel and get snacks and movie night.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll do our best to make it fun,\u201d added Marie.\n\nWilliam\u2019s message to lawmakers forcing him to go across state lines?\n\n\u201cTrans people are just other humans,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they put themselves in my shoes, they\u2019d change their mind.\u201d",

Trump argued Ukraine should have made concessions to Russian President Vladimir Putin in the months before the February 2022 attack . Trump: \u201cWhat deal can we make? It's demolished. The people are dead. The country is in rubble\u201d",
        "text": "Trump says Ukraine is \u2018demolished\u2019 and dismisses its defense against Russia\u2019s invasion\nFormer President Donald Trump described Ukraine in bleak and mournful terms Wednesday, referring to its people as \u201cdead\u201d and the country itself as \u201cdemolished,\u201d and further raising questions about how much the former president would be willing if elected again to concede in a negotiation over the country\u2019s future.\n\nTrump argued Ukraine should have made concessions to Russian President Vladimir Putin in the months before Russia\u2019s February 2022 attack, declaring that even \u201cthe worst deal would\u2019ve been better than what we have now.\u201d\n\nTrump, who has long been critical of U.S. aid to Ukraine, frequently claims that Russia never would have invaded if he was president and that he would put an end to the war if he returned to the White House. But rarely has he discussed the conflict in such detail.\n\nHis remarks, at a North Carolina event billed as an economic speech, come on the heels of a debate this month in which he pointedly refused to say whether he wanted Ukraine to win the war. On Tuesday, Trump touted the prowess of Russia and its predecessor Soviet Union, saying that wars are \u201cwhat they do.\u201d\n\nThe Republican former president, notoriously attuned to slights, began his denunciation of Ukraine by alluding to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s recent criticism of Trump and running mate JD Vance.\n\nZelenskyy, who is visiting the U.S. this week to attend the U.N. General Assembly, told The New Yorker that Vance was \u201ctoo radical\u201d for proposing that Ukraine surrender territories under Russian control and that Trump \u201cdoesn\u2019t really know how to stop the war even if he might think he knows how.\u201d\n\nSaid Trump, \u201cIt\u2019s something we have to have a quick discussion about because the president of Ukraine is in our country and he\u2019s making little nasty aspersions toward your favorite president, me.\u201d\n\nUkraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy addresses the 79th session of the United Nations General Assembly, Wednesday, Sept. 25, 2024, at the UN headquarters.

He questioned whether the country has any bargaining chips left to negotiate an end to the war.\n\n\u201cAny deal \u2014 the worst deal \u2014 would\u2019ve been better than what we have now,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIf they made a bad deal it would\u2019ve been much better. They would\u2019ve given up a little bit and everybody would be living and every building would be built and every tower would be aging for another 2,000 years.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat deal can we make? It\u2019s demolished,\u201d he added. \u201cThe people are dead. The country is in rubble.\u201d\n\nZelenskyy is pitching the White House on what he calls a victory plan for the war, expected to include an ask to use long-range Western weapons to strike Russian targets.\n\nWhile Ukraine outperformed many expectations that it would fall quickly to Russia, outnumbered Ukrainian forces face grinding battles against one of the world\u2019s most powerful armies in the country\u2019s east. Ukraine has lost a fifth of its territory and tens of thousands of lives in the conflict.\n\nTrump laid blame for the conflict on President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, his Democratic rival in November. He said Biden \u201cegged it all on\u201d by pledging to help Ukraine defend itself rather than pushing it to cede territory to Russia.\n\n\u201cBiden and Kamala allowed this to happen by feeding Zelenskyy money and munitions like no country has ever seen before,\u201d Trump said.\n\nNotably, Trump did not attack Putin\u2019s reasoning for launching the invasion, only suggesting Putin would not have started the war had Trump been in office. He did say of Putin, \u201cHe\u2019s no angel.\u201d",

        "text": "Donald Trump: I went to a pro-Trump Christian revival. It changed my understanding of Jan 6.\nOn a sweltering evening in the thumb pad of Michigan\u2019s mitten, a self-described prophet promised 700 Christians under a crisp white tent that they were about to cheat death.\n\nThey would do this by winning the swing state for Donald Trump.\n\nThe reasoning was simple: Each of the Christians assembled would soon feel a call to become a poll watcher or to knock on doors or to organize their church\u2014to take part in some act that would aid the Republican presidential candidate. And that act would keep them safe, the prophet said, because God would not call them home before they had completed the task He had given them.\n\n\u201cThe greatest argument you have with death is an unfulfilled assignment,\u201d the man, Lance Wallnau, told the crowd.\n\nThis was the third stop of the \u201cCourage Tour,\u201d a traveling worship spectacle passing through key battleground states ahead of the upcoming presidential election. Organized by Wallnau, a sixtysomething Texas-based evangelical with a salesman\u2019s persona, the three-day event was a marriage of the religious and the political, a swirl of prophecies and PowerPoints and speaking in tongues. It was a call to arms, a campaign strategy session, and\u2014above all\u2014an honest-to-God old-fashioned Pentecostal tent revival.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was also a showcase of the power of a rapidly growing, militant right-wing movement in American Christianity.\n\nWallnau is a major leader in a coalition of Christians who believe that Trump is prophesied to play a critical role in the nation\u2019s spiritual reformation\u2014that the former president is destined to be a catalyst for the next Great Awakening, even. These Christians see Trump as a modern-day Cyrus the Great, the powerful empire builder and nonbeliever who is credited in the Old Testament with returning the Jews to the Holy Land. They believe that under Trump\u2019s protection, American Christians will rise up, defeat their demonic enemies, and take their rightful place of power in the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis belief in a Trump prophecy has only grown stronger among the faithful since the former president survived an assassination attempt in July. It is so strong, in fact, that anything that could stand in Trump\u2019s way\u2014democratic or otherwise\u2014is perceived as a force of evil that must be battled on a spiritual plane.\n\nThis has already played out once: After Trump lost the 2020 election, Wallnau held nearly daily rants about the stolen election on Facebook Live; he decreed in one online prayer call that God would overturn the election results. He spoke at a major rally for Christian election deniers in Washington on Dec. 12 of that year, warning that there was \u201ca backlash coming\u201d and announcing that it would be the \u201cbeginning of a Christian populist uprising.\u201d He and other right-wing Christian leaders circled the Capitol while blowing shofars and praying for the election to be overturned, drawing clear parallels to the biblical story from the Book of Joshua in which the Israelite army marches around the city of Jericho, blowing horns until its walls crumble and the Israelites conquer the city and slaughter its inhabitants. The event, which preceded a night of political violence in the nation\u2019s capital, drew thousands of attendees in what was widely seen as a precursor to the Jan. 6 riot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWallnau did not participate in the storming of the Capitol, but he was at the Jan. 6 rally and was even slated to speak outside the building. He said that he and similar leaders in his movement had stayed up late at a D.C. hotel the night before the riot, looking\u2014successfully, he claimed\u2014for definitive evidence of \u201csystemic national fraud.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThough he later blamed antifa for the violence of Jan. 6\u2014or, alternatively, dismissed negative media coverage of the riot as the works of the \u201cfalse prophets of Baal\u201d\u2014Wallnau\u2019s political rhetoric today is once again geared toward preventing another Trump loss at all costs. \u201cWe have to operate at a level where we can go against the gates of hell,\u201d he told the crowd under the white tent in Michigan. \u201cThis is the room that can save the nation.\u201d\n\nFor Americans unfamiliar with the evangelical world, it can be hard to grasp how rapidly this right-wing movement is changing Christianity in the U.S. and turning politics, in many Christians\u2019 minds, into a zero-sum war between the forces of evil and the armies of God. Matthew Taylor, a scholar at the Institute for Islamic, Christian, and Jewish Studies, told me that in terms of influence, Wallnau may be \u201cthe most important political theologian of evangelicalism in this century so far.\u201d Wallnau \u201chas restructured how millions of evangelicals think about their life and their politics,\u201d Taylor said. (Wallnau did not respond to requests for an interview or comment for this story.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWallnau\u2019s ideas have taken off in particular among a group of Christians often referred to as neo-charismatics, evangelicals who speak in tongues and believe that the Holy Spirit has possessed them with supernatural gifts, including prophecy and healing; this religious cohort is also one of the fastest-growing segments of Christianity in the U.S. Now, four years after an election that many of these Christians continue to think was stolen, Wallnau and his faithful are on the campaign trail. \u201cPeople don\u2019t know. They\u2019re going to look back on it in the future,\u201d Wallnau promised the crowd in Michigan, \u201cand they\u2019re going to say the populist civic awakening began when believers prayed in Trump to disrupt the status quo.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWallnau and his cohort are doing everything they can to ensure that the prophecy is fulfilled. In Michigan, I began to see how far that could go.\n\nAs I pulled into the driveway of an inconspicuous host church outside Howell, Michigan, for the first day of the revival, I was welcomed by beaming children and women waving colorful, handmade signs: Jesus Is So Excited You\u2019re Here. Today\u2019s Your Day. Jesus Saves. The line of cars crawled toward the parking lot and into an overflow field abutting a baseball complex. Even with traffic-directing volunteers and access to open fields, it took a full 13 minutes to park.\n\nThe host church, Floodgate, is known in the area for its strident politics\u2014according to an article in the Atlantic, its membership overwhelmingly comprises new arrivals attracted by its pastor\u2019s anti-COVID ravings; pastor Bill Bolin told the magazine that \u201ca lot of people from our church\u201d traveled to D.C. for the Jan. 6 riots. Even still, it was clearly not prepared for the kinds of crowds Wallnau attracts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt first, it would have been easy to forget that this was a political event if it hadn\u2019t been for a cluster of vendor tents hosting groups such as the pro-Trump Turning Point USA. The main tent, an open-air structure filled with rows of folding chairs, exuded a festival-like atmosphere. The air was sticky with humidity, Christian rock blared from the speakers, and people were cheery. They were also, I noted with some surprise, not entirely retirement-age. In the crowd\u2014overwhelmingly but not exclusively white\u2014parents with young children hovered just beyond the tent, bouncing babies on hips or sprawled on blankets on the grass. T-shirts and shorts were the norm. No fussy church clothes here. Somewhere to the left of the tent, a group prayed in a huddle. When they broke apart, one of them blasted a shofar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe event kicked off when a woman in a black T-shirt and jeans bounded across the stage, leading a band and the crowd in a spirited rendition of the 2023 Christian Billboard hit \u201cHoly Forever.\u201d Everyone knew the words. Over the next half-hour, the singer, a Georgia-based artist with 77,000 followers on Facebook, hit other contemporary evangelical hits, including 2019\u2019s \u201cRaise a Hallelujah\u201d (sample lyric: \u201cMy weapon is a melody\u201d) and 2023\u2019s \u201cPraise\u201d (\u201cMy praise is a weapon\u201d). In interludes, she pointed to individual attendees and passed along messages she\u2019d received from God. \u201cYou feel like you can\u2019t hold on that much longer,\u201d she told a woman in a blue dress. \u201cThe Lord said\u201d\u2014and here her voice picked up into a yell, ready to break into the triumphant chorus\u2014\u201c \u2018I am going to renew her strength!\u2019 \u201d The songs were catchy, and the energy in the tent was electric; I couldn\u2019t help but join in, clapping to the beat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the musical portion of the night, Bolin, the host church\u2019s pastor and a right-wing celebrity in this part of Michigan, spoke about his church\u2019s explosion in membership over the coronavirus pandemic. He made fun of medical experts who supported COVID-19 vaccines, then, inexplicably, had the audience do the wave. (We were bad at it, but not for lack of enthusiasm.)\n\nAn hour into the event, Wallnau strode onto the stage with an easy and strikingly white smile. He worked up the attendees, eliciting murmurs of anger as he ranted about the left. He whipped them into states of anxiety (\u201cHell is more organized than we are\u201d) and hope (\u201cI received a word in Israel that Trump will be the next president\u201d).\n\nBut he was warm. He poked fun at himself. During one short rant about the World Economic Forum and similar globalist threats, he winkingly said, \u201cI can tell you\u2019re an educated crowd of conspiracy enthusiasts.\u201d\n\nOver the next hour and a half, he primed the audience (and the 100,000 viewers he said were watching the livestream) for the hours of seminars ahead of them that weekend. There was a lot to cover; many hours would be dedicated to strategies for preventing the left from stealing the next presidential election. He called on the Christians to engage in \u201cspiritual warfare,\u201d a kind of religious practice meant to defeat evil forces through fervent prayer, praise, and other displays of faith. For neo-charismatics, these rituals are more effective when physically directed toward and in close proximity to the evil they are meant to address. This is why, ahead of the certification of the 2020 presidential election results, leaders in Wallnau\u2019s movement traveled to D.C.: They felt called to pray as close as possible to the evil forces that were keeping the election from Trump. Many other Christians, inspired by this mission, followed them there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat this kind of prayer does, according to Wallnau, is fortify God\u2019s forces of angels against Satan\u2019s armies. By speaking in tongues, throwing their hands up to the sky, singing God\u2019s praises, anointing people with oil, blowing shofars, and calling upon God\u2019s authority to defeat demons, neo-charismatics are commanding and assisting angels in the spiritual realm. Those angels, in Wallnau\u2019s theology, are the ones waging the warfare against evil; earthbound Christians are aiding the army in a metaphysical sense. \u201cWe\u2019re not warring with flesh and blood,\u201d Wallnau told the crowd at the revival. \u201cWe\u2019re warring with spirits working on people.\u201d\n\nApostles and prophets like Wallnau are generals in this metaphysical army\u2014they have the gift of being able to see, through prayer, into the workings of the spiritual realm and mobilize mass campaigns of believers to fight a strategic war on a supernatural plane.\n\nMore traditional conceptions of this kind of supernatural battle focus on personal stakes: praying to wage battle against whatever demonic force is causing depression or cancer or even a struggling marriage. Some Pentecostal churches choose to wage these spiritual battles against what they perceive as occult forces, such as freemasonry, new-age spirituality, and satanism. The neo-charismatic movement doesn\u2019t dismiss prayer for individual struggles and certainly enjoys opposing the occult, but its real appetite is for national and ultimately global control of the earthly realm. Neo-charismatics who follow Wallnau and similar leaders want to use prayer to wipe civic and societal institutions clean of demonic forces, then populate those institutions with people who will implement and uphold a Christian society.\n\nWallnau ended the day on a loving note. He prayed for supernatural healing for those in pain: \u201cIn the name of the Lord, I rebuke Satan, get your hands off them,\u201d he intoned. He told attendees to hug the person sitting next to them. Lightning rippled in the distant clouds, and he sat down at a keyboard and played his audience off with a jaunty show-tune performance of a song with lyrics pulled from the Book of Revelation. As the crowd streamed out of the tent, everyone was in high spirits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe original Great Awakening was a series of 18th- and 19th-century religious revivals that swept through the American colonies and states, establishing evangelical Christianity as an enduring and powerful force in the country. The roots of the new Great Awakening Wallnau is hoping to kick off can be traced back to an evangelical project from about 30 years ago\u2014but became supercharged during the pandemic.\n\nIn the 1990s, a cohort of evangelicals imagined a new revolution in Christianity\u2014the group dubbed it the New Apostolic Reformation\u2014that would reorganize worship around modern-day apostles and prophets who could hear directly from God and channel the divine into routine wonders. Most of these apostles and prophets were untethered to any larger organization or denomination. Some had their own churches; others, like Wallnau, served as itinerant preachers, taking messages to multiple congregations, as well as to TV and social media. But all these self-appointed prophets were relentlessly political. They warned of demons that threatened to harm Christians through laws and public schools and sinful movies, and they taught believers how to channel the Holy Spirit to fight off those demons. They urged followers to conquer the secular world and win it back from the forces of evil.\n\nFor years, the NAR remained on the fringes of evangelical Christianity. Few were comfortable with the incendiary talk of demonic possession and the stated push to totally erase the separation of church and state. But everything changed with Trump\u2019s election.\n\nAt the beginning of his first presidential run in 2016, most mainstream evangelicals were wary of a thrice-married, philandering billionaire. But NAR leaders immediately praised Trump, a man they admired for his televangelistlike swagger. Wallnau in particular supported Trump long before he was taken seriously as a candidate, offering theologically contorted rationales for his devotion to the real estate tycoon. Once Trump became president, he drew prominent NAR members, including Wallnau, into his White House; his own spiritual adviser, Paula White-Cain, was one of them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump knew little of doctrinal matters, but he could spot loyalty. His public favor boosted the NAR leaders; he also benefited from a message they began to spread that he had been divinely endorsed.\n\nDuring the COVID pandemic, neo-charismatic churches run by NAR prophets swelled in numbers as they remained defiantly open despite lockdown rules. They attracted converts from mainstream Christian parishes that remained closed, and politically ambitious prophets in this network soon became Facebook celebrities. Some gained real-world influence: Sean Feucht, a Christian singer who led massive COVID-era worship events across the country, as well as a pro-Israel counterprotest at Columbia University this past spring, is an acolyte of the movement. So is Ch\u00e9 Ahn, whose Pasadena-based Harvest Rock Church successfully sued Gov. Gavin Newsom over the lockdown there in 2020.\n\nAs NAR leaders became the political power brokers of evangelical Christianity, their symbols and ideas proliferated. The \u201cAppeal to Heaven\u201d flag\u2014a simple pine tree over a white background that has become a symbol of Christian nationalism and was flown at the insurrection, as well as by politicians including Speaker of the House Mike Johnson and Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito\u2014was resuscitated by the NAR from its origins in the American Revolution. On Jan. 6, rioters blew shofars, Jewish ceremonial trumpets appropriated by neo-charismatics as a symbol of spiritual warfare, toward the Capitol and even into the broken windows of the Capitol building, summoning angels to engage in combat on behalf of Trump. When the Alabama Supreme Court briefly outlawed in vitro fertilization, its chief justice, Tom Parker, used terminology particular to the NAR to explain his reasoning. Powerful conservatives from varied Christian backgrounds have taken up the call to weaken the separation of church and state\u2014a project that Wallnau and his ilk frame as going to battle for Christ\u2019s kingdom on earth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is why, sweating in a black polo and khaki slacks, affable and smiling, Wallnau promised the members of the faithful in Michigan that they would be shortly hearing from God. \u201cEvery one of you has an assignment,\u201d he said. \u201cMy job for all of you is to find your unfinished assignment, because America is too young to die.\u201d\n\nAt an earlier point in his career, Wallnau was a motivational speaker, and on his professional websites and online merchandise stores he\u2019s still described as a \u201cstrategist\u201d and \u201cfuturist.\u201d But over the past several decades, he has become most well known for resurrecting a niche, \u201970s-era Christian call to arms: a mandate for believers to conquer the \u201cseven mountains of society\u201d\u2014family, religion, education, media, arts and entertainment, business, and government.\n\nAs Wallnau put it in an essay printed in the 2013 volume Invading Babylon, \u201cWe need more disciples in the right place, the high places. The world is a matrix of overlapping systems or spheres of influence. We are called to go into the entire matrix and invade every system with an influence that liberates that system\u2019s fullest potential.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd to Wallnau\u2014and other similar charismatic evangelicals\u2014the system\u2019s fullest potential depends on Trump.\n\nTaylor, the scholar and author of The Violent Take It by Force, a forthcoming book about the NAR\u2019s influence on the Jan. 6 insurrection, has found in his research that more than 50 neo-charismatic Christian leaders were in Washington that day. Ahn, the California pastor, spoke at the main \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally on Jan. 5, calling it \u201cthe most important week in America\u2019s history.\u201d Another major NAR leader broadcast daily prayers ahead of the rally; in a predawn address hours before the insurrection, he too proclaimed on social media that it was \u201cone of the most critical days in our history.\u201d Taylor waded through hundreds of social media accounts from Christians involved in the Jan. 6 riot and noted that one of the most common denominators among them was interaction with these calls\u2014and with Wallnau\u2019s streamed rants.\n\nKnowing all this, I had expected Wallnau in person to have a fiery personality to match his warlike rhetoric. And over the next few days, I would certainly see signs of Wallnau\u2019s extremism, as when he reiterated that in the End Times, Jesus would be coming back \u201cnot as a therapist\u201d but \u201cin flames to wreak vengeance on his enemies.\u201d Or when he warned that the predatory left was going to make children suicidal by \u201cevangelizing\u201d them into thinking they\u2019re the wrong gender, at one point telling the crowd, \u201cYou\u2019re authorized to take the Philistines out of position.\u201d\n\nBut I also saw a man who was disarmingly goofy. Twice during the three-day event, Wallnau recounted, in full detail, a scene from the movie Gladiator. Sitting in a movie theater in 2000, watching Maximus and his band of slaves fend off men in chariots in the Colosseum, Wallnau said, he had sensed God telling him to pay attention. Onstage two decades later, in his lengthy retelling of the scene\u2014employing an impressive Russell Crowe impression\u2014Wallnau shared the significance of the gladiators locking their shields, moving and fighting as one. He told members of the cheering crowd to lift their right hand in the air and, on the count of three, yell \u201cAs one!,\u201d chopping their arm as if they were \u201cbreaking the neck of the demon afflicting you.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Gladiator spiel reminded me of an incident from 2022. That September, a major Twitter account had posted a video of a rally for the Christian nationalist Pennsylvania gubernatorial candidate Doug Mastriano in which a man onstage had commanded attendees to lift their right hand in the air, proclaiming, \u201cAmerica will have a new birth of liberty.\u201d (Mastriano would go on to lose badly to Josh Shapiro.) Liberal Twitter users who shared the viral video online expressed horror at a Nazi salute\u2019s being performed in Pennsylvania. In my car, I searched for the old clip. Sure enough, the man in the video was Wallnau, and he was leading Mastriano supporters in an \u201cAs one!\u201d Gladiator chop.\n\nI was a little irrationally indignant on his behalf. And for a moment, before I remembered that the \u201cCourage Tour\u201d was laying the groundwork for another such violent attack in the event of Trump\u2019s loss this year, I felt for Wallnau. The secular world had undeniably, in this instance, distorted a rather benign action. Toward the end of that first night, Wallnau shared a message he had received from God, an articulation of his particular assignment: \u201cThey have a caricature of who you are, they\u2019ve got the \u2018weird MAGA Christian-nationalist insurrectionist\u2019 narrative out there. Your job is to contradict the narrative.\u201d\n\nTalking to evangelical scholars later, I realized what was so striking to me about Wallnau\u2019s delivery. Against all evidence to the contrary, I had the feeling in that tent that he just wanted to heal the country, to bring us together. And I was, in a strange way, almost happy for the charismatics around me: They were being offered the promise of purpose in their lives, a pitch to be part of something big and exciting. \u201cWe often think of Christian extremism as about hate,\u201d Taylor told me. \u201cWallnau has found a way to make it inspirational.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I arrived at Floodgate on the second morning, this time prepared for the heat with three full water bottles, the music was going again, and Wallnau, now in a more casual \u201cCourage Tour\u201d shirt and gray jeans, was busy laying hands on believers.\n\nJust in front of the stage, a dozen or so attendees clustered around him, waiting to be anointed with oil. I watched as Wallnau grasped a woman by the back of the neck and prayed over her, forehead to forehead, murmuring. Then, suddenly, gripping her head in both hands, he blew on her brow. As if she\u2019d been bowled over by a hurricane-force wind, the woman fell back into the arms of her fellow believers, who gently eased her to the ground, where she lay in the downy grass with four other siblings in Christ, overcome by the sublime presence of the Holy Spirit.\n\nTo their left, a hyenalike shriek pierced through the Christian rock. A woman had been possessed with holy laughter, which some of the faithful\u2014after particularly intoxicating brushes with the Spirit\u2014can by seized with for hours at a time. (The wife of the pastor of Floodgate, we were told, had once laughed for four straight days.) The possessed woman convulsed in her folding chair, heaving with laughter, drawing enraptured hand-laying from her compatriots.\n\nThat this kind of religious ecstasy preceded a day of seminars amazed me. Soon, Wallnau would be introducing the day\u2019s first speaker, a Christian nationalist historian named Bill Federer, whose PowerPoint on U.S. history was both boring and packed with misleading assertions (for example, that many historic lynchings targeted Republicans who had registered Black people to vote) as well as many outright falsehoods (including that a 2023 reproductive health bill in California would have allowed people to kill babies 28 days after birth). (Federer did not respond directly to a request for comment but rejected the characterization of his presentation as misleading or containing falsehoods in a lengthy blog post about the Civil War, abortion, and religion.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFederer was followed by representatives from the America First Policy Institute, Turning Point USA Faith, Moms for America, and a group for Black conservatives selling \u201cMAGA Black\u201d baseball caps, which I saw just white people wearing. \u201cYou\u2019re the only people who go from divine-healing miracle service and getting filled [with the Holy Spirit] to precinct strategies,\u201d Wallnau said approvingly to the crowd.\n\nI sat through sessions that presented convoluted (and wildly incorrect) evidence that the 2020 election had been stolen. I watched a representative of the group My Faith Votes propose a letter-writing campaign. (Wallnau added that people should lay hands on the letters in prayer before sending them.) I saw one woman urge people to stop supporting \u201cwoke companies\u201d and one man advise attendees to learn how to file FOIA requests.\n\nThe practical approach didn\u2019t always go over well: When the America First Policy Institute representative posited that Trump had lost his election because Christian men over the age of 60 hadn\u2019t turned out in high-enough numbers, a bearded man behind me repeatedly yelled, his voice hot with anger, \u201cWe didn\u2019t lose!\u201d\n\nI had imagined a bifurcated experience based on the \u201cCourage Tour\u201d program: political lectures during the day, worship at night. But for the leaders of this movement, as with their goals for the country, the political and the spiritual could not be separated. One speaker, while displaying an image of Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, screamed, with true fire-and-brimstone energy, \u201cI prophesy they\u2019re going to jail!\u201d\n\nAnother lecturer, a man named Joshua Standifer, came onstage the first day just as a soft rain began to fall, breaking the afternoon heat. \u201cThey say rain is a sign of blessing,\u201d he said, to appreciative audience laughter.\n\nThe Lord, Standifer explained, had called on him to start a group called the Lion of Judah, which would serve as a kind of National Rifle Association for biblical values. The group\u2019s goal was to install believers in polling places, \u201clike a Trojan horse\u201d in the enemy\u2019s camp. To do that, he encouraged everyone to become an election worker so that they could document and report suspicious activity and lay the ground for potential legal challenges.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s more of us than them,\u201d he said, in language that echoed certain rioters on Jan. 6. \u201cWe can take back this nation, one county at a time. We\u2019re going to win Michigan.\u201d\n\nIn an email, Standifer later said that his organization was focused not on ensuring a particular electoral outcome but on getting Christians involved in politics. \u201cRegardless of what the media or others may think, our cities need election workers who will stand for truth, justice and who have a moral compass rooted in the Lord,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe rhetoric and labeling of Christians as threats to democracy is wrong and dangerous during the uncertain times in which we live.\u201d\n\nAfter Standifer left the stage, Wallnau led a prayer to expose hidden works of darkness affecting the election, before asking those who felt energized to raise their hands in prayer. He was anointing them, he said, to become poll workers.\n\nWatching Wallnau lead these Michiganders through a kind of spiritual oath to \u201cprotect\u201d the election, I felt a deep sense of dread. This seemed far more dangerous than any hype man screaming about the evils of the secular world. Wallnau\u2019s vision for his great revival hinged on another Trump administration. The stakes meant that there was no room for a divergent outcome\u2014or for anyone, really, who might disagree.\n\nAs another headlining charismatic prophet at the event, Mario Murillo, put it, \u201cIt\u2019s no longer about conservatives vs. liberals. It\u2019s not Republicans vs. Democrats. Now it\u2019s good vs. evil.\u201d\n\nMurillo was more serious in tone than Wallnau. A bearded man with a set grimness to his face, Murillo led the main worship session on the second evening. In his introduction, he launched into a story of a pastor being cured of Stage 4 cancer the previous night in Eau Claire. As his story wrapped, the air, which had felt stifling under the tent, began to stir. \u201cI had asked for a cool breeze,\u201d Murillo said simply. There was none of Wallnau\u2019s winking. (Murillo did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe live in a moment that is precisely like that of America before the Civil War,\u201d he thundered. \u201cAll of the features of abuse, dishonesty, and evil are present now.\n\n\u201cAmerica has sinned,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAmen!\u201d the audience yelled.\n\n\u201cAmerica has abandoned God,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAmen!\u201d the audience yelled, louder.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no sweeping under the rug the seeds America has sown,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou are the lowest human being on the planet if you take a scalpel to a child to alter their gender.\u201d\n\nAround me, everyone got to their feet, furiously applauding.\n\n\u201cWhat they\u2019re trying to do to our children should awaken us to war in Jesus\u2019 name,\u201d he roared. \u201cWe have got to declare war on the demons trying to come after our children.\u201d\n\nAs a brassy hum picked up around the tent\u2014the sound of multiple shofars being blown\u2014Murillo proclaimed, \u201cThe Founding Fathers didn\u2019t want us to be loyal to the government. They wanted us to be loyal to the truth.\u201d\n\nThen, more quietly, his voice creaking: \u201cThe power of God is on my body, so strong I\u2019m barely able to stand.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI looked up at the people on their feet around me, who just half an hour earlier I had seen happily singing about God\u2019s grace. They were now yelling and cheering. Someone behind me screamed out, \u201cWar!\u201d\n\nAccording to neo-charismatic prophets, the assassination attempt on Donald Trump on July 13 had been foretold. Several months earlier, on March 14, an Oklahoma prophet with 359,000 subscribers posted a podcast episode to YouTube in which he discussed the spiritual ramifications of the impending solar eclipse. In it, he also mentioned a vision he\u2019d had: \u201cI saw Trump, rising up, and then I saw an attempt on his life,\u201d the prophet said. \u201cThis bullet flew by his ear, and it came so close to his head that it busted his eardrum.\u201d\n\nAfter Trump did indeed survive an assassination attempt that wounded his ear, neo-charismatic evangelicals spoke of the incident as \u201cproof\u201d of \u201cmiracles.\u201d Jentezen Franklin, the pastor of a Southern megachurch, compared the moment with Moses\u2019 anointing Aaron as his high priest in Leviticus because the book mentions placing blood on Aaron\u2019s ear. And as Wallnau would later tell his Facebook followers, when Wallnau learned of the assassination attempt, he went to his prayer closet, \u201cwhere he keeps a cardboard cutout image of Trump,\u201d and, \u201cas he prayed, he cupped Trump\u2019s cardboard ears with both hands.\u201d He told his followers that he hadn\u2019t yet known where Trump had been shot. It all added up to an irrefutable message to those plugged into this world: Trump was favored by God.\n\nIn some ways, though, the response to Trump\u2019s miracle seemed almost perfunctory. It had been almost a decade since Wallnau and other NAR leaders first rallied behind the former president as a kind of savior figure; the consensus on his righteous role is nearly universal among that segment of charismatics. The event that actually brought new life to the right-wing charismatic world came soon afterward, when Kamala Harris replaced Joe Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cShe represents an amalgam of the spirit of Jezebel in a way that will be even more ominous than Hillary because she\u2019ll bring a racial component, and she\u2019s younger,\u201d Wallnau said in a video about Harris. In another, he said that she appeared presidential only because of \u201cwitchcraft.\u201d Murillo appeared on Wallnau\u2019s podcast to discuss the \u201cdemonic power\u201d at work in the new Democratic nomination. \u201cThat\u2019s why God spared Trump\u2019s life, for such a time as this,\u201d Murillo said.\n\nBecause although Wallnau and his compatriots have paved the way for evangelicals to embrace Trump, their real power lies in how they vilify their enemies.\n\n\u201cThey believe if God is not in control of something, automatically the devil is; it\u2019s an either/or,\u201d said Karrie Gaspard-Hogewood, a sociologist at Tulane University who studies neo-charismatic Christianity. \u201cThere\u2019s no compromise with the devil.\u201d\n\nAnd when millions of Americans believe that Harris is literally possessed by a demon, or that her party is acting on behalf of the devil, that could have repercussions for how they expect their elected representatives to govern\u2014and how they might treat a Trump loss. \u201cGod can\u2019t be wrong; the prophet can\u2019t be wrong,\u201d Gaspard-Hogewood said. \u201cIt must be human error or some kind of nefarious act.\u201d\n\nThis reality hit me in the tent that second night of the revival in Michigan. I could no longer conjure any cheer. My mood had been curdled by the transformation of such a friendly crowd, by Murillo\u2019s raw anger, by the details from his diatribe: the way he said he was sick of Pride month, spitting out the word to hearty applause, or how he had the audience stand up and read the quote from American Revolutionary Thomas Paine: If there must be trouble, let it be in my day, that my child may have peace.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut where I heard warnings of violence, Murillo seemed to think he was spreading hope. He could see the agony of his fellow Americans as he traveled around to these events, he said. \u201cThe audiences are desperate. They\u2019re broken. They\u2019re coming to the tent because they read a card that said God could heal them. They\u2019ve waited three to four hours in an emergency ward. They\u2019ve been given drugs that have worse side effects than what\u2019s actually wrong with them. They don\u2019t have the money for their surgery. They don\u2019t have the time to take off work to get well. They\u2019re suffering. They\u2019re in an American hell created by socialism. That compassion grips me. It consumes me.\u201d\n\nThen he pointed to a person in the crowd. \u201cAnd then it hit me how God was healing a woman right over here,\u201d Murillo said.\n\nQuicky, he pointed again, to the back of the middle section of the tent. \u201cGod is healing a man, right somewhere near that pole. In your heart, in your chest. Heart disease is being healed.\u201d\n\nAgain and again, he identified people who were being healed, with remarkable specificity. He directed a woman with a blond ponytail to place her hands on a second woman\u2019s head and tell her that the Lord was curing her in her neck, back, chest, and legs in Jesus\u2019 name. The healing, Murillo said, was backing up through the blond woman\u2019s arm, in turn repairing her spine and eyes. The damage she had from a car accident, it\u2019s all gone, he said. She began sobbing. \u201cThis is where cancer starts to vanish,\u201d he cried out as the whole tent began speaking in tongues. \u201cThis is where diabetes starts to become a thing of the past.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI watched an older woman grow overcome by the proclamation that a protrusion in her abdomen was being burned out of her body. I watched another woman, in a blue dress, cover her face, shaking and nodding, when Murillo told her that she had been scheduled for an operation but that that operation was canceled, all glory to Jesus Christ. I watched him tell another person that multiple sclerosis was leaving their body, then point around the assembled and declare that the other ailments he sensed\u2014\u201ccancer,\u201d \u201cheart disease,\u201d \u201ca lump in the throat that is scaring you to death\u201d\u2014had vanished.\n\nThe crowd was euphoric, and my earlier panic softened into a deep sadness. This was why this segment of Christianity was growing so rapidly, I realized. So many of these attendees were desperately seeking healing and answers. They were, in some way or another, deeply disappointed in society, misdirecting their anger onto immigrants, gay teachers, and transgender people. But they were bound together by shared suffering.\n\nMurillo promised everyone that they would remember the healing they had experienced over the weekend. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be talking about this 30 years from now,\u201d he said, \u201cthe power of God, the way everyone got lost in Him.\u201d\n\nI had little doubt it would be true. And no doubt it did actually help some of those in pain: Medical experts have known for centuries that there are mysterious healing powers in belief. Everyone around me felt, with an undeniable intensity, a type of grace they weren\u2019t getting from society.\n\nWallnau and Murillo seem to be true believers, invested in their flocks. But Wallnau, as a former strategist, also knows something important: The NAR will only grow, and gain more footholds in those seven mountains of society, if it continues to link its cause to genuine human despair. Wallnau can and does say remarkably incorrect and hateful things, but to those in his audience\u2014suffering from the American medical system\u2019s cruel and byzantine billing system or financial distress or the frightening absence of a safety net\u2014what matters is that they feel, momentarily, in control.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn that final night, Murillo healed the whole tent. He had everyone lay hands on their neighbors, pray in tongues. He called on those who could not walk to move their legs, to stand. Some did. One woman abandoned her walker and took off. A man began running around. In the aisle next to me, another person stood, hidden by a cluster of people around him. They reached out their arms, touching him, wanting to be part of his miracle.\n\nTo the believers, the air in the tent seemed electric with signs of God\u2019s favor. Come November, when it is time to keep the prophecies alive and secure the future of America, Wallnau and Murillo will know where to turn.",

        "text": "New Report from CSIS Analyzes Global Impact of the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election\nWASHINGTON, DC \u2013 September 26, 2024 \u2013 The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) today released a major new report, The Global Impact of the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election, which provides an in-depth analysis of the presidential election\u2019s potential effects on the future of U.S. foreign policy.\n\nThe report, which serves as the inaugural publication from the newly formed CSIS Geopolitics and Foreign Policy Department, features insights from 21 leading CSIS experts examining how regional leaders are preparing for shifts in U.S. global leadership, regardless of the election\u2019s outcome. The analysis covers key security, economic, and geopolitical challenges, including the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and Europe, the rise of authoritarian coalitions, political and economic drivers in Africa and Latin America, and China\u2019s growing assertiveness. The report offers a broad global perspective and detailed assessments of the potential changes in U.S. relations across Europe, Eurasia, the Indo-Pacific, the Americas, Africa, and the Middle East, as well as policy recommendations for the next U.S. administration.\n\n\u201cWhile there are many differences to be found in a Kamala Harris or Donald Trump presidency, our scholars also found few in their regions and countries preparing for continuity overall in relations with the United States after this election\u2014they are preparing for change, with only the pace or intensity being determined by who occupies the White House in January 2025,\u201d said Dr. Victor Cha, president of the Geopolitics and Foreign Policy Department. \u201cThis report of the Geopolitics and Foreign Policy Department provides concise analysis, predictions, and recommendations for the way forward.\u201d\n\nThe CSIS Geopolitics and Foreign Policy Department brings together the institution\u2019s leading regional experts and research programs to offer cross-cutting analysis of the most challenging issues that will define U.S. global leadership in the decades ahead. The confluence of war, pandemics, great power competition, and the weaponization of politics and trade have created fundamental discontinuities in our notions of global order. Finding the balance between preserving elements of the existing order, adopting new rules and norms, and deterring military conflict sits at the heart of the mission of the Geopolitics and Foreign Policy Department. The department\u2019s research programs will offer high-quality, nonpartisan analysis on domestic politics, political economy, and foreign policy across all countries and regions of the globe.\n\nDr. Cha will serve as the president of the Geopolitics and Foreign Policy Department. He most recently served as CSIS senior vice president for Asia and CSIS Korea Chair. He is also professor of government at Georgetown University and previously served on the National Security Council with responsibility for Japan, Korea, Australia/New Zealand, and Pacific Island nations.\n\nThe formation of the Geopolitics and Foreign Policy Department is part of a broader strategic realignment of CSIS programming to better prepare the institution to meet global challenges in the coming years. With a focus on geopolitics, economic security, technology, defense, and U.S. global engagement, CSIS will integrate cross-disciplinary research on both short- and long-term issues that will determine American prosperity and security in the decades ahead.\n\nVisit here to learn more about the CSIS Geopolitics and Foreign Policy Department.

        "text": "NC Election Officials Removed Nearly 750,000 Ineligible Registrants Since Start of 2023\nRaleigh, N.C.\n\nNote: This press release was updated on Sept. 27, 2024, to include a video from the State Board of Elections regarding voter roll list maintenance.\n\nFrom the start of 2023 through August 2024, county boards of elections in North Carolina removed more than 747,000 ineligible registration records from the state\u2019s voter rolls.\n\nThat\u2019s an average of more than 1,200 voter records removed from the voter list every single day during those 20 months. The county boards follow careful policies to ensure that only ineligible records are removed, not those of eligible voters.\n\nMeanwhile, newly eligible voters are constantly being added to the registration rolls in our growing state. Currently, North Carolina has nearly 7.7 million registered voters.\n\nRegistrants can be removed from the rolls for many reasons, including:\n\nThey moved, either to a different county or away from North Carolina.\n\nThey spent two federal general elections in inactive status and didn\u2019t respond to mailings from their county board of elections attempting to confirm their eligibility.\n\nThey died.\n\nThey were convicted of a felony and are serving a sentence, including probation, post-release supervision, or parole.\n\nThey had a duplicate registration.\n\nThey requested to be removed.\n\nThey were the subject of a successful voter challenge.\n\nThey are not a U.S. citizen.\n\nSee the chart below for data on removals from the registration database.\n\nTable: Count of Removals From Registration Database by Reason (January 2023 Through August 2024) Reason for Removal Count Moved within state (Duplicate) 289,902 Two federal elections in inactive status 246,311 Deceased 130,688 Moved from state 31,242 Duplicate/Merged duplicate 26,939 Felony conviction 18,883 Request from voter 2,329 Other 980 Total 747,274\n\nNote: Removals for lack of citizenship are not specifically coded into the elections database. Any removals for this reason may be coded as \u201cRequest from voter\u201d or \u201cOther.\u201d Due to a recent law going into effect requiring the identification of registrants excused from jury service due to noncitizenship, the State Board is working to code this specific removal reason into the database.\n\nThese list maintenance processes and others, both to add and remove registration records, are prescribed by state and federal laws and detailed in the State Board\u2019s North Carolina Voter Registration List Maintenance Guide (PDF). The county boards of elections follow careful practices to ensure that eligible voters are not removed in error.\n\n\u201cList maintenance is one of the primary responsibilities of election officials across North Carolina, and we take this responsibility seriously,\u201d said Karen Brinson Bell, executive director of the State Board of Elections. \u201cUnfortunately, there is a lot of false information out there about our voter rolls and the efforts we undertake to keep them up to date. As we conduct these processes, we also must comply with state and federal laws and be careful not to remove any eligible voters.\u201d\n\nMaintaining the voter registration list is an ongoing process, with the goal of having the most accurate voter rolls possible. The process evolves over time as election officials identify new ways of identifying potentially invalid or inaccurate registrations with available resources. However, due to several factors, there will always be such registrations that are not initially identified for removal or correction. For example, voters die every day, but official death records may not reach election officials until weeks later. And people move out of the state every day without canceling their North Carolina registration. Eventually, list maintenance processes catch up with those individuals, and they are removed from the rolls.\n\nThe mere presence of ineligible individuals on the rolls does not mean voter fraud will occur. Evidence shows that voting in the name of another is exceedingly rare in North Carolina. A comprehensive 2017 audit of the 2016 presidential election, in which nearly 4.8 million N.C. voters cast ballots, identified two cases in which family members voted in the place of a recently deceased loved one. See Post-Election Audit Report: 2016 General Election (PDF).\n\nAdditionally, the photo ID requirement in place for the 2024 general election makes it more difficult for any voter to vote in the name of another person, which is a felony. See Certain acts declared felonies (N.C.G.S. \u00a7 163-275(1)).\n\n\u201cWe have extremely little evidence that individuals are voting in the names of others in North Carolina elections, and the voter photo ID requirement will help ensure this does not happen,\u201d Brinson Bell said.\n\nNew List Maintenance Processes\n\nIn addition to routine list maintenance practices, election officials are working on new efforts aimed at maintaining more accurate voter rolls and removing ineligible registrants. The State Board instituted some new processes at the request of citizen activists and others due to changes to state law.\n\nOne such law change, which took effect July 1, requires clerks of superior court across the state to provide lists of voters who request to be excused from jury duty because they claimed they were not U.S. citizens. In August, the clerks provided that data to the State Board, which matched them with North Carolina\u2019s voter rolls. Nine individuals matched statewide.\n\nThe State Board is in the process of checking those nine voters against state and federal databases to determine whether they have obtained citizenship. If that check does not show they are now citizens, the State Board will send them letters informing them of the agency\u2019s findings and inviting them to cancel their registrations to comply with the law. It is a felony to register to vote or vote if you are not a U.S. citizen.\n\nIn North Carolina, numerous laws and processes work together to ensure that only qualified U.S. citizens cast ballots in elections. For more information, see How does North Carolina ensure that only U.S. citizens can vote?\n\nAdditionally, over the past couple years, at the urging of citizen activists, the State Board has initiated a series of automated data checks designed to correct data entry errors and other inaccuracies in the voter registration database. After conducting these automated checks, the State Board sends reports to the county boards, which include the following data:\n\nDuplicate voter registration numbers\n\nData entered into the wrong registration fields\n\nPossible invalid voter birth years\n\nPossible invalid voter registration dates\n\nDuplicate driver\u2019s license numbers\n\nThe county boards then review and research these flagged records and take corrective action when warranted. In recent months, the State Board has conducted numerous training sessions for county boards of elections on these and other aspects of voter roll list maintenance.\n\nNew Voters Are Welcome\n\nJust as ineligible voters are removed from the registration rolls every day, new eligible voters are also added to the rolls every day. People become eligible to vote by becoming of age (at least 18 years old by general Election Day), moving into the state, obtaining citizenship, or completing a felony sentence. And, of course, not all eligible citizens register to vote immediately upon becoming eligible. A presidential election year is when many such citizens decide to register.\n\nAlso, interest in voter registration is at its highest in the months leading up to a presidential election, when voter registration organizations ramp up their efforts to engage more North Carolinians in the electoral process.\n\nAs a growing state, North Carolina has seen a 4.3% increase in its registered voter population since the 2020 election.\n\n\u201cWe welcome North Carolina\u2019s newest voters and we are working to ensure they have a smooth experience at the polls this year,\u201d said Brinson Bell. \u201cFor any North Carolina citizen who is not registered, now is the time to fill out their registration form.\u201d\n\nEligible voters can register online to vote if they have a North Carolina driver\u2019s license or other NCDMV identification. Otherwise, any voter can fill out a paper voter registration application, which can be printed from the State Board\u2019s website: ncsbe.gov.\n\nThe voter registration deadline for the general election is Oct. 11, 2024. If a person misses that deadline, they can still register and vote at any early voting site in their county during the early voting period: Oct. 17 through Nov. 2, 2024. A person cannot register on Election Day, however, which is Tuesday, Nov. 5, 2024. Voters can check their registration status online at the Voter Search tool.\n\nWatch: Voter Roll List Maintenance (YouTube)",

Are you registered to vote?\n\nThe state-imposed deadline to register for the November election is Oct. 7, and residents can verify their registration status online to ensure their information is up to date. A statewide search tool is available on the website of the Texas Secretary of State\u2019s Office.\n\nVoters in Harris County, which includes Houston, can check their registration status at Harris Votes.\n\nEarly Voting\n\nJoe Brueggeman/Houston Public Media\n\nEarly voting across Texas begins on Oct. 21 and runs until Nov. 1.\n\nMany counties, including Harris County, allow their voters to cast ballots at any polling location within their jurisdiction, regardless of where they live. Other counties may require voters to go to the polling location in their home precinct.\n\nCheck with your local voter registrar or elections office to see where they allow you to vote and when polls are open during early voting as times can vary from county to county. Some counties\u2019 procedures for early voting may differ from their protocols on Election Day.\n\nIn Harris County, all 88 early-voting locations will be open during the following hours:\n\nOct. 21 \u2013 Oct. 26 \u2014 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.\n\nOct. 27 \u2014 Noon to 7 p.m.\n\nOct. 28-Oct. 30 \u2014 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.\n\nOct. 31 \u2014 7 a.m. to 9 p.m.\n\nElection Day\n\nPolls will be open from 7 a.m.-7 p.m. statewide on Tuesday, Nov. 5. As long as a voter is in line at a polling location by 7 p.m., they will be allowed to vote.\n\nAs with early voting, some Houston-area counties allow voters to cast ballots at any polling location within their jurisdiction, whereas others require voters to vote in their home precincts. Harris County allows voters to cast ballots at any of its 688 polling locations on Election Day.\n\nWhat you can bring\n\nVoters should bring forms of photo identification or other materials that confirm their identity and right to vote in the election (see more on this below). They also can bring sample ballots and handwritten notes.\n\nNo phones, tablets, laptops, cameras or any device that can communicate wirelessly or record sound or images may be used inside a polling location or within 100 feet of one.\n\nVoters likely will notice 100-foot markers as they approach a polling place. Within that 100-foot space, no one is allowed to post, use or distribute any signs or literature relating to a candidate, political party, or measure appearing on the ballot in that election.\n\nVoters who need assistance casting their ballots, including for translation purposes, are permitted to bring one other person to help them \u2013 as long as that person is not their employer, an agent of their employer, or an officer or agent of their union. These voters must notify the presiding election judge so the helper can take an oath and sign paperwork swearing they are not forcing the voter to cast a ballot against their will and are not persuading the voter to vote a certain way.\n\nWhat you can wear\n\nDominic Anthony Walsh/Houston Public Media\n\nTexas law prohibits voters from wearing clothing, hats, buttons and other forms of apparel at the polls if those items relate to a candidate, political party or measure appearing on the ballot in the current election. However, apparel related to candidates, parties or measures that are not on the ballot are allowed inside polling locations.\n\nFor example, a red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat would not be allowed, since former President Donald Trump is a candidate in this year\u2019s presidential race. A t-shirt with a photo of former President Barack Obama would be allowed since he is not on the ballot.\n\nAcceptable forms of ID\n\nIllustration by Todd Wiseman\n\nRegistered voters can cast provisional ballots without any form of identification, but that requires some legwork after voting. To ensure your civic duty is fulfilled as soon as you cast your ballot, bring one of the following forms of photo ID to your polling location:\n\nTexas Driver\u2019s License or ID card issued by the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS)\n\nTexas Handgun License issued by DPS\n\nU.S. citizenship certificate containing a photo\n\nTexas Election Identification Certificate issued by DPS\n\nU.S. passport (book or card)\n\nU.S. military ID containing a photo\n\nWith the exception of the citizenship certificate, the ID presented must be valid or, for voters aged 18-69, have expired no more than four years beforehand. For voters who are 70 or older, there are no time limits regarding an expired ID.\n\nVoters with no approved photo ID may apply for an Election Identification Certificate from DPS at no charge.\n\nIf voters do not have any of the aforementioned forms of photo ID, they can fill out a Reasonable Impediment Declaration and show a copy or original of one of the following forms of ID:\n\nA government document that shows their name and address, including a voter registration certificate\n\nCurrent utility bill\n\nBank statement\n\nGovernment check\n\nPaycheck\n\nAlso acceptable is a certified domestic birth certificate or document confirming birth that is admissible in a court of law that establishes identity. This could include a birth document from a foreign country.\n\nThe Reasonable Impediment Declaration form can be found online.\n\nIf voters are unable to provide identification or one of the aforementioned supporting documents, they can vote provisionally by signing a provisional affidavit and curing their ballot within six days after the election. They can cure their ballots by bringing an approved form of photo ID to their local voter registrar or elections office.\n\nEXEMPTIONS: Voters with a disability may apply with their county voter registrar for a permanent exemption to showing an acceptable photo ID or following the Reasonable Impediment Declaration procedure at the polls. Voters with a religious objection to being photographed, or those who do not present an acceptable form of photo ID or follow the Reasonable Impediment Declaration procedure at the polls because of certain natural disasters, may apply for a temporary exemption to those requirements. Voters should contact their local voter registrar for more details about those exemptions.\n\nVoting by mail\n\nKeren Carri\u00f3n / KERA News\n\nTexans who meet certain requirements can receive and cast ballots by mail instead of voting at a polling location. Voters in the following groups are eligible to vote by mail:\n\nAge 65 or older on Election Day\n\nSick or disabled\n\nWill be out of their home county during early voting and on Election Day\n\nExpected to give birth within three weeks before or after Election Day\n\nJailed but otherwise eligible to vote\n\nThe deadline to request a mail ballot for the November general election is Friday, Oct. 23.\n\nPer the requirements outlined in Senate Bill 1, the elections law passed in 2021 by the Texas Legislature, all mail-ballot applications as well as submitted mail ballots must include one of the following identification numbers that match what is on the voter\u2019s registration record: Texas Driver\u2019s License or state-issued ID number, Texas Election Identification Certificate number or the last four digits of the voter\u2019s Social Security Number. Voters can help ensure their mail-ballot applications and submitted mail ballots are accepted by including all the aforementioned ID numbers that apply to them.\n\nIn Harris County, ballot-by-mail applications sent through the United States Postal Service can be mailed to the Harris County Clerk\u2019s Office, P.O. Box 1148, Houston, Texas, 77251-1148. Applications sent by a common or contract carrier should be delivered to the Harris County Clerk\u2019s Office, 1001 Preston St., 4th Floor, Houston, Texas, 77002.\n\nHarris County voters also can fax their mail-ballot applications to 713-755-4983 or email them to vbm@harrisvotes.com. But if applications are faxed or emailed, the original application must still be sent by traditional mail and received by the voting clerk no later than the fourth business day after it was received by fax or email.\n\nVoting-by-mail applicants who are at least 65 years old or disabled qualify to submit an annual application, which means they\u2019ll receive mail ballots for all elections during a calendar year. Those can be submitted no later than the 11th day before Election Day.\n\nIf mail-ballot applicants decide to instead vote in person, they can do so by bringing their mail ballot to surrender at the polling location. If they do not bring their unused mail ballot, they can vote provisionally.\n\nCompleted mail ballots must be postmarked by 7 p.m. on Election Day and received by 5 p.m. on the first mail delivery day after Election Day. If they are sent by common or contract carrier \u2013 such as a personal courier, FedEx or UPS \u2013 ballots must be received by 7 p.m. on Election Day. Or, if the carrier provides a receipt mark indicating a time before 7 p.m., the ballot may be received by 5 p.m. on the next mail delivery day.\n\nIn Harris County, mail ballots can also be dropped off in person on the fourth floor of the Harris County Administration Building located at 1001 Preston St., between 7 a.m.-7 p.m. Only the voter can make the dropoff and must present an acceptable form of photo ID. If the voter does not have an ID, they may show one of the aforementioned supporting identification documents and complete a Reasonable Impediment Declaration.\n\nBallots from voters who are out of the country must be received by the voting clerk no later than the fifth day after Election Day. Ballots from military voters must be received by the voting clerk no later than the sixth day after Election Day.\n\nDo the following when completing and submitting a mail ballot:\n\nUse black or blue ink\n\nPlace the completed ballot in the envelope and seal it\n\nPlace the sealed envelope in the enclosed pre-addressed carrier envelope\n\nProvide the appropriate ID number or numbers underneath the flap of the carrier envelope\n\nSeal the carrier envelope and sign where indicated, using the same signature as used on the mail ballot application\n\nPlace the appropriate postage and send\n\nThe Harris County Clerk\u2019s Office also recommends including contact information, such as a phone number or email address, so voters can be contacted by elections office staff to resolve any mistakes or omissions. Harris County voters can call 713-755-6965 for mail-ballot assistance in English, Spanish, Chinese or Vietnamese.\n\nMail ballots in Harris County can be tracked online at https://www.harrisvotes.com/Voter/Mail-Ballot-Tracking.\n\nVoting Machines\n\nDaisy Espinoza / Houston Public Media\n\nBoth electronic voting and paper ballots are utilized in Harris County, where voters will receive two sheets of paper along with an access code. They will insert the first piece of paper into a voting machine, where they will make selections electronically before printing and reviewing their choices. Then they will be prompted to insert the second sheet of paper and repeat the process.\n\nIf mistakes are identified, voters should tell an election worker. They can make corrections up to two times.\n\nTo cast their votes, Harris County voters will insert the printed, filled-out sheets of paper into a scanning machine. An American flag will appear on the screen after each sheet is inserted, indicating the process is complete.\n\nVoting Accessibility\n\nDavid J. Phillip / AP\n\nVoters with disabilities \u2013 including hearing, vision and mobility impairments \u2013 have resources available to them as required by law.\n\nCurbside voting is available for those who cannot physically enter a polling place. Such voters may ask an election officer to bring a ballot to a parked vehicle at a polling place\u2019s designated curbside location. After marking their ballots, curbside voters can give them to the election officer or, at their request, to a companion who will then submit the completed ballot.\n\nVoters with mobility limitations can ask an election official for voting order priority, which will prevent them from having to stand in line. Whether that priority is granted is up to the presiding election judge.\n\nIn addition to curbside voting, Harris County provides the following forms of voter assistance:\n\nThe ballot is available in four languages: English, Spanish, Chinese and Vietnamese\n\nVoting machines let you increase the font size or contrast on the screen\n\nAccessibility booths that are wider and have a separate control to accommodate mobility devices or a chair\n\nVoting machines can hook up to components for voters with disabilities (such as headphones and Sip and Puff devices)\n\nThe voting machines in Harris County are equipped with two large buttons as an accessibility aid. They\u2019re plugged into a standard 3.5-mm jack to allow for voters\u2019 own input devices. Headphones and narration also are available to the visually impaired.\n\nSpecial Circumstances\n\nVoters can apply for a late ballot because of sickness or disability, between the last day of early voting (November 1) and 5 p.m. on Election Day. In order to qualify for a late ballot, the sickness or disability must originate on or after the 12th day before Election Day.\n\nVoters may also apply for a late ballot due to a death in their immediate family that occurred on or after the fifth day before Election Day and caused them to be absent from their home county on Election Day.\n\nSample Ballots\n\nSample ballots, which can help voters study candidates and propositions and make their choices before going to the polls, are available online. Visit the website for the elections office in your county to find sample ballots and other elections-related information.\n\nLinks for the election offices in the Houston area are below:\n\nAustin County\n\nBrazoria County\n\nChambers County\n\nColorado County\n\nFort Bend County\n\nGalveston County\n\nHarris County\n\nLiberty County\n\nMatagorda County\n\nMontgomery County\n\nWalker County\n\nWaller County\n\nWharton County",

That year, the state's 11 electoral votes went for President Biden, who received 66% of votes, compared to former President Donald Trump's 33%. (Massachusetts' electoral votes have gone to the Democratic presidential candidate since 1988.)\n\nThis year, the race between Trump and Vice President Harris nationally is extremely close, though it's less of a nail-biter in deep blue Massachusetts, according to a WBUR poll.\n\nDown the ballot, there's a battle for a U.S. Senate seat. Republican John Deaton is challenging Democratic incumbent Sen. Elizabeth Warren. U.S. Reps. Stephen Lynch and Bill Keating face Republican challengers as well. And depending where you live, there could be competitive races for state Legislature, Governor's Council and other county positions.\n\nThe five statewide ballot initiatives before voters could reshape executive branch powers, high school graduation requirements, labor laws for Lyft and Uber drivers, access to psychedelic drugs and restaurant workers' pay.\n\nElection Day is Tuesday, Nov. 5, but there are many ways to exercise your right to vote ahead of the deadline. Here's what to know about your voting options and who is on the ballot.\n\nRegister to vote\n\nYou must be registered to vote by Oct. 26 at 11:59 p.m. It's a good idea to double check that you're registered to vote at your current address here.\n\nIn Massachusetts, you can be automatically registered to vote by the RMV or the state's Health Connector.\n\nDates to know: Registration deadline: Oct. 26\n\nApply to vote by mail: Oct. 29\n\nEarly voting: Oct. 19-Nov. 1\n\nElection Day: Nov. 5\n\nWhen you apply or renew your driver's license, get a learner's permit, apply for MassHealth benefits or for other health insurance through the Health Connector, you'll be automatically registered to vote at the address provided in those systems. But note that if you are just updating your address through the RMV or Health Connector (not re-applying or renewing), you'll still need to submit a new voter registration form for your new address.\n\nIf you're a new citizen, you can register to vote as soon as you're naturalized. However, you need to register via a paper form by mail or in person until you update your proof of citizenship with the state. If your citizenship ceremony falls after the Oct. 26 deadline, but before 4 p.m. on Nov. 4 (the day before Election Day), you may register to vote in person at your local election office. Remember to bring proof that your ceremony took place after the voter registration deadline.\n\nClick here for details on registering online, by mail or in person.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3 ways to vote\n\nWhether voting by mail, early or on Election Day, voters in 19 cities and towns in Massachusetts have the option to request a multilingual ballot. Under federal law, municipalities with a certain amount of non-English speakers will provide ballots in the group's native language.\n\nNo matter which of the following methods you use to vote, Massachusetts is one of the states that prohibits posting photos of your marked ballot on social media. You might want to opt for posting a photo of your \"I Voted\" sticker instead. (If your town or city has a fun sticker design, tag @WBUR on Instagram, Bluesky or Threads.)\n\nVote by mail\n\nA voter places her ballot into an official drop box in Cambridge. (Robin Lubbock/WBUR)\n\nIf you choose to vote by mail, there's a two-step process:\n\nApply for your mail-in ballot before Oct. 29\n\nThe state sends registered voters a paper application by mail. Fill it out, and mail it back. The state recommends doing so at least two to three weeks before Election Day to allow for any postal delays.\n\nTraducido en espa\u00f1ol por El Planeta, Boston's Latino daily.\n\nAlternatively, you can apply online here. You also can email or fax your application, but make sure to sign it (no typed signatures).\n\nCast your ballot before Nov. 5\n\nFill your ballot out, and sign it. You have a few options \u2014 with different deadlines \u2014 to send your vote in.\n\nFirst, as implied, you can mail your ballot through the U.S. Postal Service. Here's what to know:\n\nYour ballot must be postmarked on or before Nov. 5 and arrive to election officials by Nov. 8 at 5 p.m.\n\nand arrive to election officials by Leave plenty of time. The U.S. Postal Service recommends mailing your ballot at least a week before the state's deadline.\n\nYou cannot submit a mail-in ballot at your polling location on Election Day.\n\nIf you're mailing an absentee ballot from outside the U.S., the ballot needs to be postmarked on or before Nov. 5, but election officials will still count it if they get it by Nov. 15.\n\nBelow are alternate ways you can deliver your mail-in ballot, as long as you do it by the drop-off deadline, Nov. 5 at 8 p.m.:\n\nDrop it in an official ballot drop box. (See locations here.)\n\nBring your ballot to an early voting location.\n\nPut it in the hands of a worker at your local election office. (Find your town or city's office here.)\n\nIf you've submitted your vote-by-mail ballot well in advance of Election Day, check out the state's Track My Ballot tool to ensure your vote was accepted.\n\nIf there was an issue and your ballot was rejected, you can still head to your polling location on Election Day to vote. (Your vote will only be counted once. If your mail-in ballot reaches your local election office after you vote in person, the mail-in ballot will be discarded.)\n\nVote early, in person\n\nThere are opportunities to cast your ballot in person in every municipality across the state, and communities offer weekend times as well. Early voting runs from Oct. 19 to Nov. 1.\n\nEach town or city has its own hours and dates so check here for your voting windows or with your local election office for details. Unlike Election Day, you may cast your ballot at any early voting location in your municipality.\n\nVote on Election Day\n\nMedford voters in 2022. (Robin Lubbock/WBUR)\n\nElection Day is officially on Tuesday, Nov. 5, and polls open at 7 a.m. and close at 8 p.m. statewide. Find your polling place here; some may offer expanded hours.\n\nWhether voting early or on Election Day, there are only limited reasons why a poll worker may need to ask for your identification. Those reasons include if it's your first time voting in the state or if you're on an inactive voter list. If you don't have your ID handy and are asked for it, you can cast your ballot as a \"challenged ballot\" and return with your ID before polls close.\n\nIf you are admitted to a hospital or health care facility within a week of Election Day, you can apply for an Emergency Absentee Ballot up until polls close at 8 p.m. on Nov. 5. On the application, you'll need to designate someone to hand-deliver the ballot to you, and indicate why you are requesting the absentee ballot. Ask your proxy to deliver the signed application to your local election office, where they can pick up your ballot to bring to you. Then they can return the completed ballot to your local election office before polls close.\n\nWhat races are on the ballot?\n\nU.S. president and vice president\n\nIn what was originally a rematch of 2020, the contest for president got a historic shakeup when President Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed his vice president, Kamala Harris, to run in his place. Now, Harris, and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz are atop the Democratic ticket, facing former Republican President Donald Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance.\n\nVoters in Massachusetts will see six names appear on their ballot for president. In addition to Harris and Trump, Shiva Ayyadurai is running as an independent; Claudia De la Cruz is a Party for Socialism and Liberation candidate; Chase Oliver is competing as a Libertarian; and Jill Stein will represent the Green-Rainbow Party.\n\nIn Massachusetts, state law requires candidates to be listed in alphabetical order by last name.\n\nStatewide races\n\nU.S. Senate: Republican John Deaton, an attorney and retired Marine, is trying to unseat Sen.

        "text": "Voting Laws Roundup: September 2024\n2024 Updates\n\nAlthough many state legislatures either did not meet this year, went out of session before or since the last Voting Laws Roundup in May, or had less active legislative sessions this year, legislators in many states continued to introduce and advance voting and election legislation in 2024.\n\nBetween January 1 and September 16, at least 9 states enacted 18 restrictive laws, 10 of which will be in place this fall. The total so far this year is the second-highest number of restrictive laws enacted in the last four years, surpassing the figure from 2023, when more state legislatures were in session. Four states enacted 11 restrictive laws since May 3.\n\nBetween May 3 and September 16, at least 1 state enacted 1 election interference law, taking the yearly total to 2. Both laws will be in effect for the 2024 election.\n\nBetween May 3 and September 16, at least 9 states enacted 14 expansive laws. Overall, this year at least 19 states enacted 28 expansive laws, a majority of which expanded opportunities for absentee voting. All but 4 of the laws enacted this year will be in effect for the 2024 election.\n\nRestrictive Laws\n\nBetween January 1 and September 16, at least 9 states enacted 18 restrictive laws. This surpasses the number of restrictive voting laws enacted in every year for the past decade except 2021, when 31 restrictive laws had been enacted by early fall, and narrowly exceeds last year\u2019s final count of 17. Ten will be in place for the upcoming election.\n\nEleven of these restrictive laws have been enacted since our last roundup in May, headlined by Louisiana, which is responsible for 8 of them (4 of which are set to be in effect this fall). Five of these limit absentee voting. Of these 5, 3 restrict assistance with filling out or returning ballots, which will disproportionately affect voters with disabilities and people who require language assistance. One imposes criminal penalties on voters for witnessing more than one absentee ballot certificate of a voter who is not an immediate family member. And the remaining law will result in more people not having their ballots counted because they missed some required information on their mail ballot certificate.\n\nLouisiana\u2019s 3 other new restrictive laws create a documentary proof-of-citizenship requirement for people who register using a form created by the secretary of state, require third-party organizations to register their voter registration drives, and risk faulty voter purges by requiring an annual canvas of voters who have not updated their addresses and have not voted, changed their registration, signed a ballot petition, or participated in a nursing home program in the last 10 years, which is likely to include eligible voters who remain registered at the correct address.\n\nIn Alabama, a new law expands the list of crimes that result in voter disenfranchisement. Georgia enacted a law that makes it easier to challenge a voter\u2019s eligibility based on unreliable data, which may result in the removal of eligible voters from the rolls.\n\nA New Hampshire law creates stricter requirements for providing voter identification, eliminating options for registration and in-person voting. The law, which goes into effect after this year\u2019s election, will require all registrants to provide documentary proof of citizenship, age, domicile, and identity. Previously, an affidavit attesting to these qualifications was sufficient. It also requires all in-person voters to present photo ID to cast a ballot, repealing provisions that allow for provisional ballots to be cast without identification.\n\nOverall, at least 301 restrictive voting bills have been considered in 40 states this year. As of September 16, at least 5 bills are still moving through 4 state legislatures.\n\nInterference Laws\n\nSince January 1, at least 2 states have enacted 2 election interference laws. As of September 16, only 1 election interference bill remains under consideration, in Ohio. Overall, at least 60 election interference laws have been considered in 21 states this year.\n\nLouisiana enacted the only interference law passed since the May roundup. It imposes new restrictions on election officials, prohibiting them from implementing any federal election guidance or directives unless explicitly required by law or approved by state legislative committees. This could cause delays in executing routine election processes while officials wait for state approval.\n\nExpansive Laws\n\nSo far this year, 19 states have enacted at least 28 laws that expand voting access. All but 4 of these laws will be in effect for the 2024 election. Fourteen of these laws were enacted since the last roundup. Overall, at least 44 states have considered 641 bills that expand voting access this year. As of September 16, at least 8 bills are still moving through 4 state legislatures.\n\nOf the 14 expansive voting laws enacted since May, over two-thirds follow the trend of expanding absentee voting. Mississippi and New York enacted laws to make it easier for voters to fix minor mistakes on their absentee ballots that could otherwise prevent them from being counted. Colorado and Rhode Island increased drop box availability. Connecticut and Louisiana both expanded rights for absentee voters living in nursing homes. Connecticut now allows those voters to designate someone to deliver their ballot, and Louisiana extended the early voting period for them from one week to two. Connecticut also eliminated the requirement that voters on the permanent absentee list annually reaffirm their presence.\n\nIn May, Colorado became the first state to require in-person voting opportunities for eligible voters in county jails or detention centers. The law also requires that voters in jails have access to drop boxes.\n\nMinnesota enacted a state Voting Rights Act. It follows similar laws enacted in other states, such as Connecticut, designed to secure equal access to the ballot following numerous Supreme Court decisions that gutted the federal Voting Rights Act. Minnesota\u2019s expands and protects voting rights by, among other things, increasing the number of polling places on college campuses, requiring election materials to be available in languages other than English, and allowing eligible unhoused people to vote by accepting unmarked areas as valid addresses for voting purposes.\n\nOklahoma became the most recent state to restore voting rights to individuals with felony convictions returning to the community. Under the new law, voting rights will be automatically restored upon completion, discharge, or commutation of an otherwise eligible person\u2019s sentence or upon receiving a pardon. This takes effect on January 1, 2025.\n\nFinally, Nebraska\u2019s attorney general and secretary of state are refusing to implement a law explained in the May roundup that restores voting rights to eligible citizens immediately upon release from incarceration. The attorney general\u2019s view is that the law \u2014 which is the only expansive one enacted by Nebraska in the last four years \u2014 violates the state constitution. The Nebraska Supreme Court heard argument about the law on August 28. Pending its decision, the actions by state leaders mean that eligible people are unable to have their voting rights immediately restored, causing widespread confusion. Still, the roundup counts this legislation as an expansive law that is in effect.",

        "summary": " Outcome of US presidential election will impact trade and tariffs . If re-elected, President Trump has indicated he would implement a 60% tariff on Chinese goods and 10% on other countries . A Democratic administration is likely to continue working with trade allies and expanding partnerships globally .",
        "text": "Outcome of US presidential election will impact trade and tariffs\nTrump and Republican positions\n\nThe Republican party platform includes a focus on rebalancing trade by supporting baseline tariffs on foreign-made goods, passing the Trump Reciprocal Trade Act,\u00b9 and addressing certain trading practices with the goal of reducing taxes on American workers, families and businesses as tariffs on foreign producers increase.\u00b2 Moreover, the platform proposes reversing certain auto-industry-specific regulations, canceling electric vehicle mandates and blocking the importation of Chinese vehicles.\u00b3 As part of the Republican party platform, the Buy American Act\u2074 would likely be strengthened.\u2075\n\nThe most significant duty impact from the Republican side has been Trump\u2019s across-the-board tariff on all US imports. If re-elected, Trump has indicated he would implement a 60% tariff on Chinese goods and a 10% tariff on goods from other countries. This has caused many companies to start thinking now about the potential impact of these tariffs if Trump is elected.\n\nHarris and Democratic positions\n\nDuring her tenure as vice president (20 January 2021 to present), Kamala Harris has not prominently engaged with trade issues, but her past actions as a senator and public statements provide some insight into her stance on trade.\n\nIn a 2019 statement, Harris clarified that she does not align with the \u201cprotectionist Democrat\u201d ideology and opposes widespread tariffs.\u2076 Nonetheless, her voting record and public remarks indicate a cautious approach to free trade agreements. For example, Harris opposed the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) as a senator due to environmental and labor concerns. She has also expressed opposition to other trade deals, such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), citing a lack of robust environmental safeguards as a key concern. However, the Democratic platform states that there is a plan to continue working with trade allies and expanding partnerships globally.\u2077\n\nBoth Harris and President Joe Biden have criticized Trump\u2019s extensive tariffs on Chinese imports, labeling them as a burden on American consumers due to increased prices. Despite this criticism, the Biden administration has largely retained the tariffs implemented during Trump\u2019s presidency, and Harris has indicated that she \u201cwill not tolerate unfair trade practices from China or any competitor that undermines American workers.\u201d\u2078 The 2024 Democratic platform states that the targeted tariffs on China \u201cpromote US growth.\u201d\u2079\n\nUSMCA renegotiations\n\nThe forthcoming presidential term offers a chance to shape the future of the USMCA, which is set to expire in 2036 unless extended through a review process beginning in 2026. The USMCA\u2019s legislation requires extensive consultation with Congress and stakeholders well in advance, making early strategizing essential for the countries involved.\n\nThe USMCA\u2019s sunset clause introduces a \u201cdoomsday clock\u201d mechanism, mandating a review every six years to decide on an extension. If not extended, annual reviews follow until the expiration date. The approach to the USMCA review is likely to differ between administrations, with Republicans\u2019 trade policy, influenced by former US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, favoring tariff threats and \u201caggressive\u201d negotiating tactics to address trade deficits and achieve other policy goals. In contrast, the Democratic platform is likely to focus on using multilateral negotiations to improve environmental and labor standards, including through tools like the USMCA\u2019s Rapid Response Mechanism.\u00b9\u2070\n\nOngoing disputes are likely to arise during the review process, including disagreements over automobile rules of origin, Mexico\u2019s energy policies and the treatment of genetically modified agricultural products. Moreover, the US will likely seek to raise concerns about indirect market access for Chinese goods flowing through Mexico and benefitting from the USMCA agreement.\n\nElection\u2019s influence on non-tariff trade strategies\n\nUS administrations in the past decade have taken steps to address unfair trade and global issues without resorting to tariffs. Innovative strategies, such as the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States and extensive export controls policy, have proven effective in tackling issues without the detrimental side effects of tariffs.\n\nA Harris administration will likely see continued restrictions on Chinese trade and investment, particularly in strategic sectors like technology and renewable energy. It will also likely increase the push for nearshoring or friendshoring with other allies. Moreover, a Democratic administration is likely to continue working with allies and partners to protect labor and climate standards.\n\nA Republican administration, on the other hand, is likely to be focused on decreasing globalization, including a potential withdrawal from the World Trade Organization, and securing strategic independence from China by revoking its most-favored-nation status, phasing out imports of essential goods and preventing Chinese investments in US real estate and industries.\n\nImpact on companies\n\nAs companies look ahead to the potential impacts of the forthcoming election on global trade, it is becoming increasingly clear that regardless of who is elected to the presidency, the use of tariffs and non-tariff strategies as a tool in trade policy is likely to continue.\n\nIf Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs of 10% on all goods entering the US and 60% on Chinese goods are implemented, the impact on companies could be substantial. Domestic sourcing is expected to become a predominant strategy for US businesses seeking to mitigate the impact of these tariffs. In addition to domestic sourcing, country of origin planning (for China tariff mitigation) and customs valuation strategies will play a pivotal role.\n\nOne approach that many are considering is using the first-sale rule. This rule allows importers to base their customs duties on the transaction value of the first-sale in a series of transactions, potentially leading to a lower dutiable value if the first-sale occurs before the goods are subject to added value through further manufacturing or transportation. This approach has long been a standard practice in sectors that typically face higher tariffs, such as apparel, but in recent years, it has gained traction for many other goods originating from China. However, leveraging the first-sale rule requires a high level of due diligence on the part of importers and collaboration with suppliers and manufacturers, which can be burdensome for some companies.\n\nAnother trade approach that is expected to gain popularity is the use of drawback. This method permits companies to receive 99% refunds for the tariffs and fees paid upon importation, provided that the goods are subsequently exported or destroyed. Drawback can provide significant financial relief for businesses engaged in international trade by reducing the total cost of tariffs.\n\nCompanies outside of the US may also face impacts after the election. For example, the election outcomes could prompt multinational corporations to consider whether restructuring operations to better align with new, or continued, trade policies fit with their overall business model. This restructuring could include re-evaluating distribution channels and sourcing locations, as well as restructuring to allow US importers to use first-sale rule benefits and other customs valuation techniques, for example, bifurcating product- and non-product-related costs.\n\nCompanies must stay informed and adaptable, as trade policies and tariff rates can change with political shifts. It is essential to develop approaches to navigate the complexities of tariffs and to help manage their impact. Adopting a proactive strategy based on a thorough understanding of customs regulations will be key to maintaining a competitive edge in the global market, regardless of the election outcomes and the trade policies that follow.\n\n",

        "text": "US election result on knife-edge\nPhoto courtesy Tammon from Pixabay\n\nAs this year\u2019s presidential election between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris approaches, experts from Flinders University\u2019s Jeff Bleich Centre ask a simple question: whose \u2018couch\u2019 will decide one of the most consequential elections in living memory?\n\nIn countries with compulsory voting, such as Australia and many in Latin America, the system usually ensures an overwhelming majority of voters cast their ballots election after election.\n\nIn the United States, it\u2019s a very different story. Two-thirds of eligible voters turned out to vote in the 2020 presidential election, but this was the highest rate since 1900. Turnout in presidential elections prior to 2020 tended to hover between 50\u201365%.\n\nOften, it\u2019s the voters choosing to stay home on the couch who effectively decide an election\u2019s outcome, .\n\nUnder America\u2019s unusual Electoral College presidential voting system, the candidate who wins the most votes nationally does not necessarily win the election. Democrats have won the popular vote in the presidential race twice in the past 25 years and still lost the elections. This includes Donald Trump\u2019s win over Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\nAs such, victory depends on getting more voters \u2018off the couch\u2019 in key battleground states where the decisive Electoral College votes are up for grabs.\n\nIn those states, it doesn\u2019t matter what percentage of people show up to vote, or how much a candidate wins by, it is winner take all.\n\nA voter who doesn\u2019t vote, therefore, actually makes an active choice they remove a vote from the candidate they would have likely chosen, and thus give an important advantage to the person they would not have voted for.\n\nThe \u2018couch\u2019 is effectively where Americans go to vote against their self-interest.\n\nThis article, \u201cIn a US presidential election with razor-thin margins, will \u2018couch-sitters\u2019 decide who wins?\u201d by Professor of Politics Rodrigo Praino, director of the Jeff Bleich Centre for Democracy and Disruptive Technologies at Flinders University, and former US ambassador to Australia Jess Bleich, was published in The Conversation\n\nRecent research demonstrates that partisanship is an important driver of voter choice in presidential elections.\n\nThe fact that America is deeply divided is not news to most, but current survey data show how evenly split along partisan lines it actually is.\n\nWith about 30% of Americans identifying as a Republican and 30% identifying as a Democrat, there is virtually no difference in the total number of voters who support each major party.\n\nThe remaining 40% of Americans identify as \u2018independent\u2019 \u2013 that is, not loyal to either major political party. Almost seven decades of research on the American voter shows, however, that independents heavily \u2018lean\u2018 towards one party or the other, with about half leaning Republican and the other half leaning Democrat.\n\nOne possible insight into which group is more incentivised to vote is polling on people\u2019s dissatisfaction with their party\u2019s candidate.\n\nAccording to the most recent Gallup Poll data, 9% of Republicans currently have an unfavourable opinion of Trump. In contrast, only 5% of Democrats have an unfavourable opinion of Harris.\n\nPartisan voters who are dissatisfied with their party candidate have a massive incentive to \u2018stay on the couch\u2019 and refrain from voting. They don\u2019t really want to vote for \u2018the other team\u2019, but they can\u2019t stand their own team anymore either.\n\nFor example, Republican women in the suburbs, veterans and traditional Republicans have started to abandon Trump over his stances on reproductive rights and national security and his temperament. The Trump campaign clearly knows this. At a rally in New York a few days ago, he told attendees to \u2018get your fat ass out of the couch\u2019 to go vote for him.\n\nShould these disaffected Republican and Republican-leaning voters stay home on November 5, Harris may well have a decisive edge over Trump.\n\nIn 2016, Trump defied the polls and traditional voter turn-out trends by convincing some disaffected, working-class Democrats to either stay on the couch, vote for an unelectable third party candidate or, in some cases, vote for him.\n\nCould this happen again? Or will Democrats be able to reverse this phenomenon by getting exhausted Republicans who are suffering Trump fatigue to stay home, while motivating everyone from Taylor Swift fans to \u2018never Trumpers\u2019 to veterans of foreign wars to get out to vote.\n\nMany influential Republicans, such as former Vice President Dick Cheney and his daughter Liz Cheney, GOP senators, and other former Republican officials, have already indicated they will either support Harris or sit the election out.\n\nRecent trends suggest overall turnout will be comparatively high, in line with the last three federal US elections.\n\nDemocrats have traditionally benefited from higher voter turn-out, but it is not as clear this is still the case in 2024. Recent research shows that since 2016, higher turnout rates seem to have favoured the Republican Party.\n\nYet, both parties still have significant numbers of people who don\u2019t vote. According to the Pew Research Center, 46% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents didn\u2019t vote in the last three elections (2018, 2020 and 2022), compared to the 41% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents.\n\nSo again, who sits on the couch matters. Inevitably, many of those who stay home will get precisely what they don\u2019t want. When the couch wins, America loses.",

Some countries are even trying to shape the outcome. The U.S. government has disrupted Russian influence operations targeting U.S. voters, and it says Iran is behind attempts to hack the campaigns of both presidential candidates. We're joined now by NPR's Shannon Bond and Jenna McLaughlin to talk more about interference in the 2024 elections. Hi to both of you.\n\nSHANNON BOND, BYLINE: Hey there.\n\nJENNA MCLAUGHLIN, BYLINE: Hi, Juana.\n\nSUMMERS: Shannon, I want to start with you. I mean, it's kind of hard to believe it, but we're 39 days out from Election Day. I know that you've been covering foreign influence operations for a while now. Where do things stand now in terms of what other countries are doing?\n\nBOND: Well, intelligence officials say there are three major threats here, right? It's Russia, Iran and China. And they are all increasing their efforts to sway voters and target divisive issues here in the U.S. in this final run-up. And in broad strokes, when talking about what they're doing, Russia is boosting Donald Trump, as it has done in past cycles, and also attacking Kamala Harris and the Democratic Party. Russia's broad goals remain to undermine democracy and erode support for Ukraine.\n\nNow, when it comes to China, officials say they are not targeting either presidential candidate. They're actually more focused on down-ballot races and where they can find influence there. And then there's Iran, which seems pretty set on undermining Donald Trump.\n\nMCLAUGHLIN: Yeah. Juana, actually, a reminder there - there's a real backstory between Iran and Trump. The Trump administration ordered the killing of the very important Iranian general Qasem Soleimani all the way back in January of 2020. There have been threats to Trump officials ever since, and the campaign's been highlighting those threats to Trump himself recently. But this has been an ongoing thing.\n\nSUMMERS: Jenna, I want to stay with you for a minute. What more can you tell us about Iran's apparent efforts to hack into both presidential campaigns?\n\nMCLAUGHLIN: Right. It appears that they've been targeting both campaigns. It doesn't appear that they got into Biden or Harris' campaigns. They had more success, though, with Trump campaign emails. They've allegedly been sharing some of what they stole with journalists, including research on Trump's running mate, JD Vance, and also, most recently, the September letter from Trump's lawyer to The New York Times.\n\nActually, today is the first time we've seen a journalist publish the Vance dossier in full. It was on an independent Substack, and the argument was that it sheds light on the Trump campaign's perceptions of Vance's weaknesses, and, you know, the public deserves to know. Though, the blogger, Ken Klippenstein, conceded that the information in the document is pretty much public already.\n\nSUMMERS: Wait. Why is that, Jenna? Why hasn't it been widely reported on?\n\nMCLAUGHLIN: I think there's a couple things to pack there, Juana. I think, first, journalists have changed the way they approach these hack-and-link operations after Russia's success in 2016, when they leaked all those Clinton campaign emails. They're a little bit more hesitant to tweet and write about every single leak document, whether it's the perfect risotto recipe or a legitimate policy, at least without relevant context.\n\nI think ultimately here, it's about newsworthiness. This information has already been public. The Trump campaign hasn't really hidden its frustrations with Vance. And it took Iran a pretty long time to find a journalist who was willing to publish it. Meanwhile, this isn't a super impressive hacking feat. Campaigns are really big. The odds of someone clicking on a phishing email eventually are pretty high.\n\nSUMMERS: Right. And, Shannon, Jenna just mentioned Russia's past meddling attempts, so can you just tell us what we're seeing now?\n\nBOND: Yeah. I mean, Russia is widely considered the most prolific actor when it comes to these sort of foreign interference efforts. I mean, that's why we've seen these aggressive moves recently by the U.S. government to counter and disrupt some of these Kremlin attempts. So we saw the DOJ indict two employees of state broadcaster RT in this alleged scheme to funnel $10 million to pro-Trump American influencers who were posting, you know, anti-Ukraine videos, among other things. The government's also seized domains spoofing U.S. news outlets that Russian operators were using to spread fake news stories.\n\nBut that's not all Russia has been doing. It's been using AI to fake audio, video, images and text. And it's been pushing manipulated videos of Harris, including a video - the staged video accusing her of a hit and run that never actually happened.\n\nSUMMERS: Right. Jenna, it does sound like we're getting a lot of information about these attempts at election interference, but can you just tell us, what else are U.S. officials worried about as we move forward?\n\nMCLAUGHLIN: A fair amount. I'd expect ongoing intelligence gathering efforts. You know, every foreign country out there is going to want to know what these candidates are planning to do if they become president. As Shannon mentioned, Russia is extremely capable. They can target voting infrastructure or do more cyber damage, but they are distracted with the war in Ukraine, and there's only so many resources over there.\n\nAs far as Iran goes, I talked to Chris Krebs. He's the former head of DHS' Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. He said he's worried that Iran's hacking efforts might eventually break through to the mainstream. But he was actually the most concerned about what happens after the election, as the votes are getting counted. If adversaries like Iran can make people think that the voting machines are hacked or the results aren't legitimate, that could cause chaos and even some violence.\n\nSUMMERS: That was NPR's Jenna McLaughlin and Shannon Bond. Thanks to both of you.\n\nMCLAUGHLIN: Thanks.\n\nBOND: Thanks so much, Juana.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 NPR. All rights reserved.

        "text": "Where will abortion be on the ballot in the 2024 US election?\nThis November, abortion will be on the ballot in 10 states, including the states that could determine the next president.\n\nIn the two years since the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade, abortion has become the kind of issue that decides elections. Outrage over Roe\u2019s demise led Republicans to flounder in the 2022 midterms, and abortion rights supporters have won every post-Roe abortion-related ballot measure, including in red states such as Ohio, Kentucky and Kansas.\n\nThis year, most of the ballot measures are seeking to amend states\u2019 constitutions to protect abortion rights up until fetal viability, or about 24 weeks of pregnancy. Because a number of the measures are in states that have outlawed abortion, they could become the first to overturn the post-Roe ban. Others are in states where abortion is legal, but activists say the measures are necessary to cement protections so they can\u2019t be easily overturned if Republicans control the government.\n\nThese are the states slated to vote on abortion this election day.\n\nArizona\n\nAbortion rights supporters in Arizona, a key battleground state in the presidential election, are vying to pass a measure that would enshrine the right to abortion up until viability in the state constitution. A provider could perform an abortion after viability if the procedure is necessary to protect the life or physical or mental health of a patient.\n\nArizona currently bans abortion past 15 weeks of pregnancy. Earlier this year, the state supreme court reinstated a 19th-century near-total abortion ban, generating nationwide outrage that prompted the state legislature to quickly repeal it in favor of letting the 15-week ban stand.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado\u2019s measure would amend the state constitution to block the state government from denying, impeding or discriminating against individuals\u2019 \u201cright to abortion\u201d. This measure also includes a one-of-a-kind provision to bar Colorado from prohibiting healthcare coverage for abortion \u2013 which could very well pass in the deep-blue state.\n\nBecause Colorado permits abortion throughout pregnancy and neighbors five states with bans \u2013 Oklahoma, Texas, Arizona, Utah and Nebraska \u2013 the state has become a haven for people fleeing abortion bans, especially those seeking abortions later in pregnancy.\n\nFlorida\n\nOnce the last stronghold of southern abortion access, Florida in May banned abortion past six weeks of pregnancy, which is before many women know they\u2019re pregnant. Its measure, which needs 60% of the vote to pass, would roll back that ban by adding the right to an abortion up until viability to the state\u2019s constitution. Providers could perform an abortion after viability if one is needed to protect a patient\u2019s health.\n\nFlorida Republicans\u2019 tactics in the fight against the measure has alarmed voting rights and civil rights groups. Law enforcement officials have investigated voters who signed petitions to get the measure onto the ballot, while a state health agency has created a webpage attacking the amendment.\n\nMaryland\n\nLegislators, rather than citizens, initiated Maryland\u2019s measure, which would amend the state constitution to confirm individuals\u2019 \u201cright to reproductive freedom, including but not limited to the ability to make and effectuate decisions to prevent, continue, or end the individual\u2019s pregnancy\u201d. Like Colorado, Maryland has become an abortion haven because it permits the procedure throughout pregnancy. It is also relatively close to the deep south, which is blanketed in bans.\n\nMissouri\n\nAbortion opponents went to court to stop Missouri\u2019s measure from appearing on voters\u2019 ballots, but the state supreme court rejected their arguments and agreed to let voters decide whether the Missouri constitution should guarantee the \u201cfundamental right to reproductive freedom, which is the right to make and carry out decisions about all matters relating to reproductive healthcare, including but not limited to prenatal care, childbirth, postpartum care, birth control, abortion care, miscarriage care, and respectful birthing conditions\u201d.\n\nMissouri, which was the first state to ban abortion after Roe fell, only permits the procedure in medical emergencies. If the measure passes, it is expected to roll back that ban and permit abortion until viability.\n\nMontana\n\nIn the years since Roe fell, Montana courts and its Republican-dominated legislature have wrestled over abortion restrictions and whether the right to privacy embedded in Montana\u2019s constitution includes the right to abortion. Abortion remains legal until viability in Montana, but the measure would amend the state constitution to explicitly include \u201ca right to make and carry out decisions about one\u2019s own pregnancy, including the right to abortion\u201d up until viability. Providers could perform an abortion after viability to protect a patient\u2019s life or health.\n\nNebraska\n\nNebraska, which bans abortion past 12 weeks of pregnancy, is the lone state with two competing ballot measures this November. One of the measures would enshrine the right to abortion up until viability into the state constitution, while the other would enshrine the current ban. If both measures pass, the measure that garners the most votes would take effect.\n\nNevada\n\nAlongside Arizona, Nevada is one of the most closely watched states in the presidential election. Its measure would amend the state constitution to protect individuals\u2019 right to abortion up until viability, or after viability in cases where a patient\u2019s health or life may be threatened. Nevada already permits abortion up until 26 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York state legislators added a measure to the ballot to broaden the state\u2019s anti-discrimination laws by adding, among other things, protections against discrimination on the basis of \u201csex, including sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes, and reproductive health\u201d.\n\nAlthough sky-blue New York passed a law protecting reproductive rights in 2019, advocates say this measure could be used to defend abortion rights against future challenges. However, the ballot language before voters will not include the word \u201cabortion\u201d, leading advocates to fear voters will not understand what they are voting on. Democrats pushed to add the word \u201cabortion\u201d to the description of the measure, but a judge rejected the request, ruling that the amendment poses \u201ccomplex interpretive questions\u201d and its exact impact on abortion rights is unclear.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSouth Dakota\u2019s measure is less sweeping than other abortion rights measures, because it would only protect the right to abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy. Under this measure, South Dakota could regulate access to abortion \u201conly in ways that are reasonably related to the physical health of the pregnant woman\u201d in the second trimester of pregnancy. In the third trimester, the state could ban abortion except in medical emergencies. Right now, South Dakota only allows abortions in such emergencies.\n\nAlthough this measure will appear on the ballot, there will be a trial over the validity of the signatures that were collected for it.

        "text": "Partisan Split on Election Integrity Gets Even Wider\nWASHINGTON, D.C. -- Fifty-seven percent of Americans say they are very or somewhat confident that the votes for president this year will be accurately cast and counted. That aligns with how Americans have viewed the election results most years since 2008. However, it masks Democrats becoming more confident in the process and Republicans becoming less so. This has led to a record-high 56-percentage-point partisan gap, with 84% of Democrats versus 28% of Republicans having faith in the accuracy of the vote.\n\nConfidence Nationally Has Varied Little Since 2008, Still Exceeds 50%\n\nAfter registering 72% in Gallup\u2019s initial reading on this metric in 2004, the percentage of Americans believing that the votes for president will be accurately cast and counted across the country fell to 59% in 2008. It has since hovered near 60%, including a 66% reading in 2016 and 59% in 2020.\n\nAt the same time, the percentage of Americans saying they are \u201cnot at all confident\u201d in the vote has steadily climbed from 6% in 2004 to 19% today.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nFaith in Elections Buoyed by Democrats, Wanes Among GOP\n\nRepublicans\u2019 faith in the accuracy of the election results nationwide has sunk 16 points since the 2020 election, now registering 28%. This follows an 11-point decline to 44% in 2020 from 55% in 2016, the last time a majority of Republicans were confident.\n\nDemocrats\u2019 confidence in the reliability of the presidential vote increased sharply between 2008 and 2016, from 57% to 85%, and has since remained high. More than half of independents have also consistently seen it as accurate.\n\nIn 2004, when George W. Bush was in office, Republicans were more confident than Democrats, possibly a holdover from the 2000 election when Democratic candidate Al Gore lost following a disputed vote count in Florida. Four years later, with Bush still president but the 2008 election underway between Barack Obama and John McCain, GOP confidence fell to match that of Democrats. Republican confidence in the presidential vote was unchanged when next measured in 2016, before experiencing the recent sharp declines.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nAmericans are far more positive about the integrity of the vote at their own polling place, as 76% say they are very or somewhat confident the votes will be accurately cast and counted there. While there is also a partisan difference on this question, it is much narrower, with 90% of Democrats, 71% of independents and 70% of Republicans confident.\n\nPossible Voter Fraud, Ineligible People Voting Trouble Republicans Most\n\nRepublicans\u2019 doubts about the integrity of the vote for president nationwide likely stem from their concern about ineligible people voting as well as people using illegal or fraudulent means to vote. Seventy-four percent of Republicans versus just under half of independents and fewer Democrats say each of these irregularities will be a major problem across the country.\n\nFor their part, perhaps due to Donald Trump, Arizona\u2019s Kari Lake and other Republicans disputing their losses in recent elections, Democrats are highly concerned about defeated candidates refusing to concede. But whereas 75% of Democrats expect this to be a major problem, 46% of independents and a quarter of Republicans agree.\n\nSmaller percentages of all party groups -- 37% of Democrats, 34% of Republicans and 32% of independents -- expect eligible voters to be prevented from voting.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nGallup has asked about the risks of ineligible people casting votes and eligible people being denied the vote in most presidential election years since 2004. Over that time, Republicans have grown more concerned about the prospect of ineligible people voting, while Democrats have grown less concerned and independents\u2019 views haven\u2019t changed.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nA different pattern is seen with respect to people being prevented in some way from voting. After less than 40% of all three party groups expressed concern about this in 2008 and 2016, the percentages of Democrats and independents calling this a major problem spiked in 2020, to 62% and 47%, respectively. Voter access erupted as a national issue after former Georgia House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams blamed voter suppression on her loss to Republican Brian Kemp in Georgia\u2019s 2018 gubernatorial election. It was further highlighted in 2020 by widespread concerns over postal delivery of mail ballots and voter access to the polls during the pandemic. But Democrats\u2019 and independents' concerns about eligible people not being able to vote have since returned to their prior levels.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nConcern about eligible voters not being allowed to cast a vote was particularly high among people of color in 2020, registering 67%, compared with 37% among White adults. However, both figures have reverted to the percentages concerned in 2016: 42% for people of color and 30% for White adults.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe 2024 election features a profound difference in how partisans view the integrity of the nation\u2019s voting process. Democrats largely trust it and, therefore, worry the election could end as it did in 2020, with Trump disputing the outcome. Republicans, on the other hand, don\u2019t trust the process and are wary of voter fraud, thus potentially justifying such a challenge in their eyes.\n\nMeanwhile, the uptick seen in 2020 in Democrats\u2019 and independents\u2019 concerns about eligible people not being able to vote has abated, suggesting some or all of these issues may be receiving less attention today.\n\nTo stay up to date with the latest Gallup News insights and updates, follow us on X @Gallup.\n\nLearn more about how the Gallup Poll Social Series works.\n\nView complete question responses and trends (PDF download).\n\n###Embeddable###",

        "text": "\u2018Be a man and vote for a woman\u2019: Kamala Harris\u2019s unlikely edge in America\u2019s masculinity election\nA man in a baseball cap strides through a field of corn. A woman in flannel turns and smiles, a line of trucks visible behind her. As piano music swells, an American flag ripples in a gentle breeze. This video is pure, uncut Americana. Naturally, it\u2019s a political ad.\n\nSpecifically, it\u2019s an ad made by the Lincoln Project, a group of moderates and former Republicans united by a desire to topple Donald Trump and support Kamala Harris. And it\u2019s making one of the most obvious appeals to men and masculinity yet in the 2024 election.\n\nAs the ad nears its crescendo, the deep voice of Sam Elliott, an actor best known for playing grizzled but folksy cowboy types, demands: \u201cWhat the hell are you waiting for? Because if it\u2019s the woman thing, it\u2019s time to get over that.\u201d He continues: \u201cIt\u2019s time to be a man and vote for a woman.\u201d\n\nMasculinity and people\u2019s views on gender roles may be more important than ever in 2024 \u2013 and not just because Harris is the first woman of color to ever secure a major-party nomination for president. The 2022 overturning of Roe v Wade thrust women\u2019s rights to the forefront of the election. Numerous identity-based groups, including White Dudes for Harris, have gathered to drum up enthusiasm. An extreme gender gap has also yawned open among the youngest US voters: having come of age in the era of #MeToo, gen Z women are becoming the most progressive and politically active cohort ever measured \u2013 while gen Z men are increasingly apathetic to politics and drifting further to the right.\n\nConservatives are openly using anxiety around masculinity to win this election, telling men that their problems stem from not being man enough. Josh Hawley, the influential Republican senator from Missouri, published a book called Manhood: The Masculine Virtues America Needs. The Fox News host Jesse Watters went even further.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see why any man would vote Democrat. It\u2019s not the party of virtue, security. It\u2019s not the party of strength,\u201d Watters said, shortly after White Dudes for Harris held a call with more than 190,000 participants. Watters added: \u201cI heard the scientists say the other day that when a man votes for a woman, he actually transitions into a woman.\u201d\n\nWatters is not a serious person, but Americans\u2019 obsession with masculinity is, to the point that it can determine the outcome even of presidential elections where two men are running. (So, most of them.) Americans revere presidents as role models, fixating on their status \u2013 real or perceived \u2013 as founding fathers, real fathers, war heroes, and masters of diplomacy and making money and cheating on their wives without getting caught (or, at least, without getting divorced). Because presidents epitomize American notions of manhood, elections reveal what kind of man, what type and degree of masculinity, is most respected and deserving of power.\n\nView image in fullscreen Harris and Trump shake hands before their debate in Philadelphia. The Democratic nominee approached her rival first. Photograph: Alex Brandon/AP\n\nTrump has turned his campaign into a pitch for hyper-traditional masculinity. At this year\u2019s Republican national convention, he walked on stage to the James Brown song It\u2019s a Man\u2019s Man\u2019s Man\u2019s World and was introduced by Dana White, the president of the Ultimate Fighting Championship who was caught slapping his wife on camera. On the campaign trail, he has hammed it up with YouTubers and podcasters who have male-centric audiences and dim views of women.\n\nWith the general public and her opponent so preoccupied by masculinity, Harris is not emphasizing her pioneering nomination. Rather, in order to win a contest that no woman has ever won, she\u2019s trying to take advantage of stereotypes about men, women and leadership \u2013 and, when they can\u2019t work in her favor, using them to kneecap Trump instead.\n\nMasculinity, it turns out, may be the most partisan issue in US politics.\n\nA few good men\n\nWhen people conjure up the image of a \u201cgood man\u201d or a \u201creal man\u201d, they tend to imagine the same qualities: someone who is dominant, successful and tough \u2013 and who is nothing like women, according to Theresa Vescio, a psychology professor who studies gender, politics and privilege at Penn State.\n\nThis way of thinking is so pervasive that people gender political matters that, objectively, have no sex. National defense and the economy are seen as topics that men care about, because men are expected to prize being providers for and protectors of their families. Healthcare \u2013 including abortion rights \u2013 and education are seen as women\u2019s issues, because women are supposed to be compassionate caregivers. (In reality, at least among gen Z, young women care about all of these issues more than young men do.) Even the political parties themselves are gendered: Republicans are associated with more masculine issues and traits, Democrats with feminine ones.\n\nThese stereotypes inform American ideals of the presidency. \u201cWhat we expect in a good leader is that they\u2019re powerful, high status, top, able to lead. That overlaps substantially with stereotypes of masculinity and men,\u201d Vescio said. \u201cSo when we think about who would be a good leader, stereotypes of men fit and complement. There\u2019s no incongruity.\u201d\n\nThey complement one another so seamlessly, in fact, that the role of masculinity in elections was once invisible. We\u2019re so used to seeing men run for office, and seeing \u201cgender\u201d only become a buzzword when a woman steps into the fray, that we often don\u2019t even recognize that men have a gender, let alone that male candidates offer up different, competing visions of masculinity.\n\nWhen we think about who would be a good leader, stereotypes of men fit and complement. There\u2019s no incongruity Theresa Vescio, Penn State\n\nBut they do compete, even in the most animalistic ways. For example, presidential candidates are more likely to succeed when they have one key, traditionally masculine physical quality: height.\n\nThe taller candidate is more likely to win more votes and be re-elected; they are also more likely to be seen by experts as being better leaders and simply \u201cgreater\u201d. This link between height and presidential preference is so strong and so subconscious that when Richard Nixon ran against John F Kennedy in 1960, voters tended to think their chosen candidate was taller. (Kennedy was taller, and he won.) Ron DeSantis might have been laughed at for reportedly wearing ill-fitting heels when he ran for president, but he would have been right to worry.\n\nIf you\u2019re still not convinced, take the 2004 race between George W Bush and John Kerry, which hinged on the candidates\u2019 supposed manhood to a startling degree. Bush sold himself as a down-home rancher who may have occasionally been \u201cmisunderestimated\u201d but who you wanted to grab a beer with. Kerry, meanwhile, was a Vietnam combat veteran with a deep understanding of policy. This presented a problem for Bush: how could he be \u201cthe man\u2019s man\u201d when his opponent was part of the uber-masculine military?\n\n\u201cWhat they did was, they went and they attacked his service record, because that was his greatest political strength,\u201d said Jackson Katz, author of the book Man Enough? Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton and the Politics of Presidential Masculinity. An advocacy group, technically formed independent of Bush, dedicated itself to questioning Kerry\u2019s record.\n\nView image in fullscreen Barack Obama speaks at the Democratic convention in Chicago in August. He made joking reference to Trump\u2019s small \u2018crowd sizes\u2019. Photograph: Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nKatz continued of Kerry: \u201cHis attitude was like: \u2018This is beneath me, to respond to these attacks.\u2019 And it backfired. Because in the masculinity narrative, if you don\u2019t defend your honor that\u2019s being besmirched, you\u2019re emasculated, you\u2019re not strong.\u201d\n\nKerry, of course, lost.\n\nThe architect of the attack to undermine Kerry is now working on Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign, which is attempting to run the same playbook against Tim Walz. JD Vance, Trump\u2019s running mate, has suggested that Walz left the national guard to avoid serving in the Iraq war.\n\nIn fact, Walz was in the national guard for 24 years and left to run for Congress several months before his unit was deployed to Iraq. Walz has defended his record \u2013 but Team Trump isn\u2019t typically all that worried about the truth.\n\nMasculinity subtext comes text\n\nWhen Trump descended down a golden escalator during the 2016 primary, we entered a new, far more obvious era of presidential masculinity. During that primary, Trump loved to talk about \u201cLittle Marco\u201d Rubio, which prompted Rubio to attack Trump for his supposedly undersized hands. There is no better proof that masculinity underscores presidential elections than two candidates subtly accusing one another of having small penises.\n\nWell, maybe there is: Trump, the man who started the dick-measuring contest, won the one for the White House, too.\n\nThe more people believe that traditional notions of masculinity are good and true, the more likely they were to vote for Trump in 2016, when Trump ran against a woman, and 2020, when Trump did not, Vescio found in a 2021 study. This finding held true regardless of people\u2019s party, gender, race or level of education. It also held true even after Vescio controlled for people\u2019s trust, or lack thereof, in government, undermining the idea that Trump\u2019s popularity is due to his populism rather than his masculine posturing.\n\nWhen it comes to cosplaying masculinity, one of Trump\u2019s greatest assets is his disinterest in reality. In other words: he\u2019s good at making big, bold, often untrue statements, and people like that in a man.\n\n\u201cTrump promises, more than anybody else: \u2018I\u2019m going to do this.\u2019 Oftentimes, in violation of what the president can actually do,\u201d said the political scientist Dan Cassino, who studies male gender identity at Fairleigh Dickinson University. \u201cBut he says he\u2019s going to go in and fix a problem. \u2018I\u2019m going to do this on day one. Whatever Congress says doesn\u2019t matter.\u2019 That sort of agentic behavior is perceived as being very, very masculine.\u201d\n\nRepublicans, especially, really like this kind of behavior in a man. This can partially be chalked up to demographics. Both men and older people, who are more likely to embrace traditional gender roles, are likelier to be Republicans. It can be explained by the nature of conservatism itself. Conservatives want to preserve tradition.\n\nView image in fullscreen Richard Nixon and John F Kennedy debate each other in 1960. Photograph: Pictorial Parade/Getty Images\n\nThere\u2019s also another explanation: sexism.\n\n\u201cAs researchers, we differentiate between hostile sexism and benevolent sexism. Hostile sexism is: \u2018Women are terrible and it\u2019s OK to beat your wife,\u2019\u201d Cassino said. \u201cBenevolent sexism is more like: \u2018Oh, women are pure and precious, we have to protect them.\u2019 That means keeping them out of things like politics, putting up separate spheres.\u201d\n\nLilliana Mason, a Johns Hopkins University professor who studies partisan identity, measured people\u2019s hostile sexism by asking whether they agreed with statements like: \u201cWomen seek to gain power by getting control over men.\u201d Republicans, she found, were on average about twice as likely as Democrats to show signs of hostile sexism.\n\n\u201cThe better predictor of being Republican is not gender, but sexism,\u201d Mason said. \u201cThere are a lot of women who hold sexist attitudes and are pro-patriarchy and believe that women shouldn\u2019t be in power.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve encountered shades of this attitude: in January 2020, I met a woman in her 30s from Louisiana, at the March for Life, the largest annual anti-abortion gathering in the United States. Women, she told me at the time, should not be president, because they just can\u2019t be leaders in the same way as men.\n\n\u201cWomen and men are completely different biologically,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so for that reason, I believe that they should have specific jobs for who they are, biologically.\u201d\n\nShe planned to vote for Trump.\n\nThe better predictor of being Republican is not gender, but sexism Lilliana Mason, Johns Hopkins University\n\nSexism is more than a collection of views about women \u2013 it\u2019s a belief system about how men and women should interact. (And that men and women are the only two genders.) But as much as Trump may benefit from the GOP\u2019s sexism, he doesn\u2019t seem all that interested in gender relations. He has praised and attacked individual women, including his accuser E Jean Carroll, often over their looks, but he rarely speaks about women as a category.\n\nInstead, he has largely delegated that to JD Vance.\n\nIn addition to claiming that \u201ctraditional masculine traits are now actively suppressed from childhood all the way through adulthood\u201d, Vance has denigrated childfree women as \u201cchildless cat ladies\u201d, agreed that the purpose of the \u201cpostmenopausal female\u201d is to help raise grandchildren, and claimed women who prioritize careers over families are on \u201ca path to misery\u201d.\n\n\u201cVance is very much doing appeals, I think, less about masculinity, more about benevolent sexism,\u201d Cassino said. \u201cAt its edges, it goes into what is called natalism, that the job of women is to reproduce, which is the extreme, extreme end of benevolent sexism.\u201d\n\nThis is the Vance innovation on the already masculine Trump ticket: he operationalizes Trump\u2019s static vision of white-man hypermasculinity into a blueprint for how genders should live with one another. If Trump and Vance win, that blueprint could be turned into policy.\n\nView image in fullscreen George Bush and John Kerry shake hands after their debate in Tempe, Arizona, on 13 October 2004. Photograph: Jim Bourg/Reuters\n\nThere are signs that Trump is coming around to Vance\u2019s approach \u2013 at least when it comes to abortion, one of Trump\u2019s biggest electoral weaknesses and an issue that has quite a bit to do with male-female relations.\n\n\u201cI WILL PROTECT WOMEN AT A LEVEL NEVER SEEN BEFORE,\u201d he posted to TruthSocial over the weekend. \u201cTHEY WILL FINALLY BE HEALTHY, HOPEFUL, SAFE, AND SECURE.\u201d\n\nThe feminine catch-22\n\nWhen Harris walked out on stage at the Democratic convention to accept her party\u2019s nomination for president, Kelly Dittmar was immediately struck by one thing.\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t wear white,\u201d said Dittmar, who, as the director of research at Rutgers\u2019 Center for American Women and Politics, makes something of a living noting how powerful women present themselves in public.\n\nWhite is the color of the suffragettes who fought for women\u2019s right to vote in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; Democratic women regularly don it for the major rituals of US politics, including the convention. \u201cLike half the crowd was wearing white,\u201d Dittmar pointed out.\n\nBut not Harris. She wore a navy suit and a matching pussy bow blouse.\n\nIt was an unmistakable declaration: Harris did not want to focus on how she has made history. In the weeks since, she has stayed true to that stance. When presidential debate moderators brought up abortion and Donald Trump\u2019s racist lies about her identity, Harris didn\u2019t respond with anecdotes about her experience as a woman of color. Instead, she told the audience: \u201cI do believe that the vast majority of us know that we have so much more in common than what separates us.\u201d\n\nIf Hillary Clinton stands accused of focusing on her gender too much when she ran for president in 2016, Harris is doing everything she can to avoid falling into the same trap. But the braided nature of masculinity, leadership and politics leaves female political candidates in such a bind that even the act of raising an eyebrow becomes fraught.\n\nDemocrats don\u2019t need Harris to go out and shoot guns in her campaign ad or on the campaign trail Nichole Bauer, Louisiana State University\n\nDuring the debate, Harris didn\u2019t bother to hide her skepticism at Trump\u2019s boasts, lies and rambling. \u201cIf she wants to win, Harris needs to train her face not to respond,\u201d the pollster Frank Luntz posted on X at the time. \u201cIt feeds into a female stereotype and, more importantly, risks offending undecided voters.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not clear what \u201cfemale stereotype\u201d Luntz \u2013 who said nothing of Trump\u2019s tendency to smirk while Harris spoke \u2013 was referring to. (The female stereotype of having expressions?) But it is true that \u201cas a female candidate, you have to be feminine, because otherwise you\u2019re not a good woman\u201d, Cassino said. \u201cBut you also have to be masculine, because in the US, we\u2019ve decided that leaders are masculine. So you have to have masculine traits and feminine traits.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to telegraphing her masculine credentials, Harris has a built-in advantage: she spent years working in law enforcement, a field associated with toughness, victory and men. In her very first speech as the presumptive Democratic candidate, Harris recalled her time as a prosecutor and California attorney general.\n\n\u201cIn those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds,\u201d she said, using a line that has since become a part of her stump speech. \u201cPredators who abused women. Fraudsters who ripped off consumers. Cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain. So hear me when I say: I know Donald Trump\u2019s type.\u201d Translation: she knows how to dominate the worst of the worst.\n\n\u201cDemocrats don\u2019t need Harris to go out and shoot guns in her campaign ad or on the campaign trail,\u201d said Nichole Bauer, a Louisiana State University professor who studies political communication. \u201cBut they do need her to display those masculine qualities that we associate with political leaders, and those are really masculine qualities that we don\u2019t always think of as being gendered \u2013 like talking about her experience as a vice-president, an attorney general, a senator.\u201d\n\nLast week, Harris sat down with Oprah, who had been stunned to learn, during the debate, that the vice-president owns a gun. \u201cIf somebody breaks into my house, they\u2019re getting shot,\u201d Harris said. Then she laughed. \u201cProbably should not have said that.\u201d\n\nThat exchange encapsulated Harris\u2019s balancing act. She\u2019s got a gun and she\u2019s not afraid to use it, but she\u2019ll laugh about it. That laugh, experts said, may be one of Harris\u2019s best assets when it comes to convincing voters that she is both competent and warm. It helps burnish her claim that she\u2019s a \u201cjoyful warrior\u201d, an image that \u201ccreates a distinct persona that I think bridges those gendered expectations\u201d, Dittmar said. Joy, she continued, \u201calludes [to] kindness and even empathy, which is more traditionally associated with femininity and women\u201d.\n\nThere are very few true independents in the US electorate; all but 3% of self-identified independents lean Democrat or Republican. But that tiny fraction of the population can decide a close election. When judging a candidate, undecided voters tend to rely heavily on racial and gendered stereotypes, according to Bauer.\n\n\u201cIf Harris displays masculinity in a super aggressive way, similar to how Trump and Vance might do it, then she risks falling into this \u2018angry Black woman\u2019 stereotype that we\u2019ve been socialized to think of as a negative stereotype, as something incompatible with political leadership,\u201d Bauer said. \u201cIt\u2019s just this really narrow set of behaviors that she has to fit into to try to show her leadership qualities.\u201d\n\nIn past elections, the men who have tried to take down Trump attempted to outman him. Rubio suggested he had a bigger you-know-what; DeSantis sold himself to voters as the grown-up version of Trump; in a 2020 debate, Joe Biden snapped: \u201cDonald, would you just be quiet for a minute?\u201d But running on full-tilt masculinity would never work for Harris. Not only did it not work for most of those men, but as a woman, she cannot win a masculinity-off.\n\nView image in fullscreen Donald Trump holds up his fist at the Republican national convention in Milwaukee. Photograph: Allison Dinner/EPA\n\nInstead, her supporters\u2019 best shot at defeating Trump may be to unman him. That Lincoln Project ad, for example, framed Trump next to images of the deadly Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville. Harris, meanwhile, is pictured giving a salute. \u201cThe images of Trump in the ad are chaotic. It\u2019s social unrest,\u201d pointed out Erin Cassese, a University of Delaware political science professor. The ad seems to ask: would a real man lose control like Trump did?\n\nDuring the debate, Harris urged viewers to go to one of Trump\u2019s rallies. \u201cHe talks about fictional characters like Hannibal Lecter. He will talk about \u2018windmills cause cancer\u2019,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd what you will also notice is that people start leaving his rallies early out of exhaustion and boredom.\u201d\n\nThose attacks \u2013 the kind of attacks that could once have been directed at Biden \u2013 also undermine Trump\u2019s masculinity. Cassino summarized the message as: \u201cHe\u2019s kind of old and confused and weird. This is not a masculine guy.\u201d\n\n\u2018Toxic\u2019 masculinity\n\nAs much as the internet may like to call traditional stereotypes of masculinity \u201ctoxic\u201d, they are not necessarily bad. Success, hardiness, being a provider and protector \u2013 those can all be good qualities.\n\nThe problem, for individuals, is that stereotypes of masculinity can be so strict and stifling that they are impossible for anybody to live up to. No one can be in power at all times. You might be the boss at the office, but when you get home, your teenage children are still likely to ignore your commands.\n\nAnd, for US society as a whole, clinging to a narrow notion of masculinity really can be toxic. \u201cIt allows for aggression towards groups that aren\u2019t appropriately masculine, which would be different kinds of groups of men that we define as problems, and women,\u201d Vescio said. \u201cIt masks racism and sexism.\u201d\n\nHarris isn\u2019t right or wrong to lean into some masculine stereotypes. After all, if a woman can harness them well enough to win the most masculine office in US history, then maybe such attitudes and behaviors won\u2019t be considered \u201cmasculine\u201d any more. Maybe they\u2019re just ways that people, of all genders, can act. Maybe voters will start to value \u201cfeminine\u201d traits in leaders, too.\n\nView image in fullscreen Kamala Harris and Tim Walz campaign in Milwaukee last month. Photograph: Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n\n\u201cThe only way we can ever stop defining our politics in terms of men versus women is, have so many women run that is just not notable any more,\u201d Cassino said.\n\nSending Trump back to the White House may affirm his brand of masculinity on a national scale. The more Trump larps masculinity, the more Republicans grow to like it; the more deeply invested they become in masculinity, the more polarized the United States may become. People who support traditional masculinity also tend to show signs of sexism (benevolent and hostile), anti-Black racism, Islamophobia and xenophobia.\n\nBut, in Dittmar\u2019s view, voting Harris into office may indicate that people don\u2019t want to shove women into a separate sphere.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re voting on a lot of things, but among them is that version of leadership and our evaluation of these gendered versions of it,\u201d Dittmar said. \u201cAs well as, even more broadly, our sense of the appropriate roles of women, the ways in which women should be treated by our political leaders.\u201d",

The issue even made its way into the government spending bill this month when House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) tried unsuccessfully to insert a GOP proposal to require states to obtain proof of U.S. citizenship when people register to vote.\n\nOnly U.S. citizens can vote in federal elections, and it usually takes several years before immigrants with lawful status can apply for citizenship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it is typical for citizenship applications to spike during election years, and California is home to the largest number of lawful permanent residents who are eligible to become naturalized citizens. Thousands are doing so in time to cast votes in the Nov. 5 election.\n\nHazel Ayalde of Paso Robles poses for photos with her son, Hudson, after being sworn in as a U.S. citizen at the naturalization ceremony. (Robert Gauthier / Los Angeles Times)\n\n\u201cIn this particular election year, this bureaucratic efficiency is so politically fraught,\u201d said Xiao Wang, co-founder of Boundless, a company that helps people navigate the immigration system and analyzes trends.\n\n\u201cThis is not part of some master conspiracy to flood the country with new Democratic voters. There\u2019s a lot of statistics that show many immigrants share more in common with Republican values.\u201d\n\nThat was obvious at the citizenship ceremony in Riverside, where Victoria Van Valen, 54, was taking the oath. She had already filled out her voter registration form and just needed her naturalization certificate after the ceremony to make it official. Van Valen, who came to the U.S. from Mexico when she was 15, lived as a legal permanent resident for decades.\n\nRecently she decided she wanted to become a citizen, in part so she could vote for president this year. She said she plans to vote for Trump, citing his tough stance on immigration and his economic policies and noting that home prices have soared in Southern California since his presidency ended.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI was eager and excited to make it to this day before election day,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s an honor to exercise my freedom.\u201d\n\nNearly 4 million immigrants have gained U.S. citizenship since the 2020 election, according to federal government figures. That\u2019s a tiny fraction of the more than 158 million people who voted in 2020.\n\nAn additional 9 million people are eligible to naturalize, Wang said \u2014 though most of them are concentrated in California, New York, Texas and Florida, states that are not presidential battlegrounds \u2014 and are unlikely to attain citizenship before the election.\n\nEsperanza Martinez from El Salvador celebrates becoming a U.S. citizen at the naturalization ceremony. (Robert Gauthier / Los Angeles Times)\n\nSo how influential new citizens could be in the presidential election depends, like so much in this race, on which state they live in and whether they will vote. Their potential to shape the outcome is greatest in swing states with razor-thin margins.\n\n\u201cIn Arizona, we keep talking about how there\u2019s a 10,000-vote margin of victory,\u201d said Nicole Melaku, executive director of the National Partnership for New Americans, referring to Joe Biden\u2019s win there in 2020 by 10,457 votes.\n\n\u201cThat vote share is growing and if people make sure that [naturalized] folks engage in this year\u2019s election, they can make a significant difference.\u201d\n\nA poll released this month by the National Partnership for New Americans found that 97% of naturalized citizens in swing states plus California said they are likely to vote in the fall, while 76% said they definitely will vote.\n\nThe poll, conducted last month, surveyed 2,678 naturalized citizens who are registered to vote, plus an oversample of 200 more registered voters in each of California, Arizona, Florida, Michigan, Nevada and Texas. It was analyzed by the U.S. Immigration Policy Center at UC San Diego.\n\nNaturalized voters account for about 10% of the U.S. electorate. New citizens broadly skew Democratic, though the National Partnership\u2019s poll showed a range of political leanings. About 54% of respondents said they\u2019d vote for Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris, while 38% said they\u2019d vote for Trump.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn California, one of the organizations working to engage new citizens is TODEC Legal Center, a nonprofit helping immigrants in the Inland Empire and Coachella Valley.\n\nExecutive Director Luz Gallegos said the organization hosts first-time voter education classes multiple times a week in rural communities including Coachella and Perris. Classrooms are set up as mock polling places, with privacy screens separating a handful of voting booths. Lately, she said, the classes have been full to capacity.\n\nTerence Chin from Malaysia was sworn in as a U.S. citizen. (Robert Gauthier / Los Angeles Times)\n\nThe students learn how to register to vote, research candidates and fill out a ballot.\n\n\u201cInstead of candidates, we put La Chilindrina, El Chavo del Ocho,\u201d she said, referring to popular Mexican television characters. \u201cThey get to vote and they get their little sticker. We tell them you don\u2019t have the privilege to complain if you\u2019re not participating.\u201d\n\nThe average processing time for a citizenship application was cut in half from a record high of 11.5 months in 2021 to 4.9 months this fiscal year, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services data through July 31. A decade ago in 2014, it also took 4.9 months on average to process a citizenship application.\n\nIn the wake of the pandemic in 2020, the backlog of citizenship applications ballooned to nearly 943,000, according to a Boundless report.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe speedier processing is the result of an effort by the Biden administration to cut through the backlog.\n\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services began prioritizing naturalization applications, accepting online applications and increasing hiring. The agency also rolled back Trump-era policies that tightened eligibility criteria for fee waivers, making it easier for low-income immigrants to apply for free, and expanded public engagement about the naturalization process to reduce the flood of applications around election years.\n\nElvi Cano, 56, waited six months after applying before she obtained citizenship in December. Cano, a film and event producer in Los Angeles, moved to the U.S. 18 years ago from her native Spain. She applied to naturalize as soon as she became eligible, she said, because she wanted to vote in November.\n\nTrump\u2019s threats of mass deportation \u2014 including suggestions that he would attempt to deport immigrants in the country legally \u2014 also concerned Cano. Permanent residents can under certain circumstances be deported.\n\n\u201cGiven the current political climate, it was a significant moment in my life to be able to vote for the first Black woman as president,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted to have everything done and ready for when the moment came.\u201d\n\nOutside the Riverside citizenship ceremony, Melisa Castro with the Republican National Hispanic Assembly handed out pocket copies of the Constitution and fliers that spelled out Republican values in English and Spanish: \u201cProtect parental rights, restore public safety, lower taxes and protect unborn lives.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe said her group helps people register for whatever party they want, \u201cbut we are conservative.\u201d A lot of people had registered to vote by Thursday afternoon, said Castro \u2014 some as Democrats but the majority as Republicans.\n\nCliff Divine from France was among hundreds of people who were sworn in as U.S. citizens in Riverside this month. (Robert Gauthier / Los Angeles Times)\n\nOthers, such as Kevin Teh, were undecided on whether to vote. The 54-year-old from Chino said he went to an American school in Taiwan and came to the U.S. to finish high school and attend college.\n\nTeh said Trump\u2019s talk of mass deportations concerns him, but he said he likes that the former president supports tax cuts, and noted that his rent has risen from $2,000 to $2,800 in three years. He thinks Harris would better improve social benefits such as Social Security, disability and unemployment.\n\nStill, neither candidate is as strong as he\u2019d like on healthcare.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really want to vote just for the sake of voting,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d rather have someone who really will do the right job for all the citizens.\u201d",

        "text": "Harris vs Trump: How many swing states does US presidential candidate need to win heated battle?\nKamala Harris and Donald Trump have made swing states a top priority for their campaigns with their visits and grand rallies as the 2024 US election season heats up toward November 5. Harris vs Trump: Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Georgia will decide the winner in the November 5 election, according to a report from The Independent.(AP)\n\nIn this year's presidential election, 93 electoral votes that are up for grabs will probably determine who will take over the White House next January. Therefore, the outcome remains very much in play in seven swing states that span from the Upper Midwest to the South and back to the desert Southwest. However, the 2024 presidential candidate requires some swing states to win the battle. What are they?\n\nHow many swing states does Trump or Harris need to win?\n\nIn the highly-heated contest, three crucial states will ultimately determine the future of Harris and Trump.\n\nLosing these three states could be harmful to the candidates since these states affect the results of polls in neighboring states as well.\n\nThe key swing states include Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina, and Georgia. Out of these seven battleground states, only three will play a major role in determining the outcome for US presidential candidates.\n\nIn the November 5 election, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Georgia will decide the winner, according to a report from The Independent.\n\nShould Harris succeed in winning these three states, the effect will also be felt in nearby states, causing the Republicans to collapse like a pack of cards when the avalanche hits. But it's also important to remember that Harris is a relatively fresh candidate and this is Trump's third attempt at winning the US presidency. It means he is well-aware about the importance of swing states that could help him achieve his goal of victory.\n\nAccording to experts, Harris should focus on battleground states as they might potentially aid her in gaining a majority in the polls.\n\nAlso Read: New poll shows Kamala Harris, Donald Trump locked in tight race in four swing states\n\nAll you need to know about 3 crucial states\n\nPennsylvania (Electoral Votes: 19)\n\nIn 2020, the Keystone State assisted its native son Joe Biden win both the \u201cblue wall\u201d and the presidency.\n\nDemocratic candidates dominated Pennsylvania for years before Trump's victory in 2016, and Biden's victory in 2020 was narrowly decided by 1.2 percentage points. Pennsylvania has the highest number of electoral votes among swing states.\n\nNorth Carolina (Electoral Votes: 16)\n\nAccording to a US News analysis, the Tar Heel State may \u201clean Republican,\u201d as Trump won North Carolina in 2020 by a mere 1.3 percentage points.\n\nDemocrats hope North Carolina turns out to be the Georgia of 2024. Biden made the state the final stop on a post-State of the Union tour of swing states before he announced his withdrawal from the campaign.\n\nShould other battlegrounds support Trump, the state might potentially be a critical win for Harris.\n\nGeorgia (Electoral Votes: 16)\n\nWith Biden's significant win in Georgia in 2020, the Peach State went to a Democratic presidential nominee for the first time since Bill Clinton's victory in 1992.\n\nBlack voters were crucial to Biden's victory in 2020 due to their fervor and turnout. The same scenario may play a major role in November.",

He's the director of elections in Durham County, North Carolina, one of the most-populous areas of a state that's increasingly viewed as crucial to the 2024 presidential contest. So when a former precinct official emailed Bowens in July to warn him of a post containing voting misinformation that was spreading virally on Facebook, Bowens quickly recognized that he may be facing a crisis. The post, written as if from an authority on the subject, said voters should request new ballots if a poll worker, or anyone else, writes anything on their form, because it would be invalidated. The same incorrect message was spread on Facebook during the 2020 election, but the platform flagged the content at the time as \"false information\" and linked to a story that debunked the rumor by Facebook's fact-checking partner, USA Today. Follow: Election 2024 live updates: Trump and Harris await Presidential election results Bowens said no such tag appeared on the post, which was widespread enough that the North Carolina State Board of Elections had to issue a press release on Aug. 2, informing voters that false \"posts have been circulating for years and have resurfaced recently in many N.C. counties.\" \"It was spreading and there wasn't anything happening to stop it until our state put out a press release and we started engaging with our constituency on it,\" Bowens told CNBC in an interview. The elections board wrote a post on Facebook, telling voters to \"steer clear of false and misleading information about elections,\" with a link to its website. As of Wednesday, the post had eight comments and 50 shares. Meanwhile, multiple Facebook users in states like North Carolina, Mississippi and New Jersey continue to share the ballot misinformation without any notification that it's false. CNBC flagged posts with the false information to Meta . A company spokesperson said, \"Meta has sent them to third-party fact-checkers for further review.\" Across the U.S., with 40 days until the Nov. 5 election, state and local officials say they are puzzled by what to expect from Facebook. Like in the past two presidential election cycles, the spread of misinformation on the social network has threatened to disrupt voting in what's expected to be another razor-thin contest decided by thousands of voters in a handful of states. Recently, a Facebook post containing a false claim about Haitian immigrants eating pets in Springfield, Ohio, ballooned out of control and gained resonance after it was repeated by Republican nominee Donald Trump in a debate. In 2016, Facebook was hammered by Russian operatives, pushing out false posts about Hillary Clinton to bolster Trump. In 2020, the site hosted rampant misinformation about politically charged issues like Covid treatments, masking and voter fraud. The big difference this go-round is that Facebook has largely removed itself from the equation. In 2021, Meta began pushing political and civic content lower in its algorithms, which contributed to a dramatic decline in news traffic last year for publishers. Earlier this year, Meta announced that it would deprioritize the recommendation of political content on Instagram and its Twitter-like Threads service, a move the company said more aligns with what consumers want to see on their feeds. Still, posts with false information can spread rapidly across wide swaths of users along with comments that amplify the misinformation, and government agencies have little ability to counteract them, because they have such limited reach on the platform.\n\nwatch now\n\nAnd while Facebook has lost some of its prominence due in part to the rise of TikTok, particularly among younger audiences, the site still had more than 200 million daily users in the U.S. and Canada at the end of last year, the last time it issued regional numbers. Facebook and Instagram are generally both in the top 10 among the most-visited websites and most-popular apps in the U.S, according to the Pew Research Center and Similarweb. Interviews with nearly a dozen regional and statewide government officials with election-related duties reveal the challenges they say they're having using and monitoring Meta's apps, as well as other social networking services like X, now owned by Elon Musk. The officials say they're working overtime to ensure the safety and integrity of the election but say they're receiving little effective help from the companies, which scaled back their trust and safety teams as part of broader cost-cutting efforts that began in 2022. Meta ultimately cut 21,000 jobs, including in trust and safety and customer service, over multiple rounds of layoffs. As CNBC reported last year, the company dissolved a fact-checking tool that would have let news services like The Associated Press and Reuters, as well as credible experts, add comments at the top of questionable articles as a way to verify their trustworthiness. Reuters is still listed as a fact-checking partner, but an AP spokesperson said the news agency's \"fact-checking agreement with Meta ended back in January.\" The Meta spokesperson told CNBC in a statement that the company's \"integrity efforts continue to lead the industry and we have around 40,000 people globally working on safety and security \u2014 more than we had during the 2020 cycle.\" The company says it now partners with about 100 third-party fact-checking groups across the globe \"who review and rate viral misinformation in more than 60 languages.\"\n\nChallenges in Maricopa County\n\nLike North Carolina, Arizona is one of the seven swing states expected to determine whether Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, win the presidency. That reality has put Taylor Kinnerup in the spotlight. Kinnerup is the communications director for the recorder's office of Maricopa County, home to more than half of Arizona's population. Kinnerup and her colleagues use social media to distribute up-to-date information about election-related procedures, like when residents can mail in early ballots or where to find their voting center. It's a particularly sensitive job following Trump's false claims of voter fraud in Arizona in 2020, when the state went blue for the first time in a presidential contest since 1996. Given Maricopa County's high profile during the election season, the state often attracts attention from Facebook users across the country. Many of them, Kinnerup said, are older and still leave comments about debunked conspiracy theories, such as the false claim that Sharpie markers invalidate ballots. Kinnerup said her team places \"extreme emphasis on constant communication and transparency to the public,\" actively sharing election-related content across Facebook and Instagram, particularly during peak hours when it's more likely to reach voters. A few months ago, Kinnerup discovered that her office's Facebook and Instagram accounts were no longer linked, meaning she couldn't access the apps using the same credentials, or automatically schedule a single post to go across both sites. Ahead of the primary elections in July, Kinnerup said she struggled to resolve the account issues with Meta. She said she engaged in a monthslong email exchange with numerous representatives, but found there was \"no way to really make progress.\" When she did get a response, it was little more than a canned statement, Kinnerup said. Meanwhile, Kinnerup is busy overseeing media and constituent tours of the county's election facilities to help dispel false notions that the process is being rigged as her office continues to deal with the fallout of the 2020 election. Kinnerup said her team led more than 20 such tours in June. \"I couldn't be dealing with Meta every single day, because I had to be giving tours,\" Kinnerup said. The time spent trying to find a fix \"was a huge issue for me,\" she said. By the time Kinnerup said she'd resolved her account issues, in mid-July, she and her colleagues had wasted countless hours on the problem, leaving her team to \"feel we were put in a position where the full message we were trying to get out wasn't ever fully there.\" Even with her office's Facebook and Instagram accounts working again, Kinnerup says their organic social media posts generate little engagement, and her team has used sponsored ads to help expand reach across the platforms. Her team has continued with the facility tours, leading 25 this month. Meta's spokesperson said the company has been hosting training sessions for state and local officials since February, informing them of tools like voting alerts, which allow them to send messages to people in their area.\n\nFormer US President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump leaves at the end of a presidential debate with US Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on September 10, 2024.

Kinnerup said she was not \"aware of any of this,\" and in her year in the role has \"never received any direct communication with Meta that I'm aware of.\" Bowens told CNBC in a follow-up email that he \"was not aware of the sessions or the tools.\" Congress is well aware of potential problems. During a Senate hearing last week on election threats, Meta's head of global affairs, Nick Clegg, fielded questions about the company's election preparedness. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, expressed concern about the safety and integrity of \"down-ballot races at the state level, county level, local level.\" Intelligence agencies, Collins said, have told senators that bad actors from China could be focusing on disrupting regional races as opposed to the presidential election, and that state and regional officials \"are far less likely to receive the kinds of briefings that we receive or to get information from Homeland Security or the FBI on how to be on alert.\" Clegg said Collins was \"right to be concerned\" and that Meta's \"vigilance needs to be constant.\" \"It can't just sort of peak at the time of the presidential elections,\" Clegg said.\n\n'Three people will see it'\n\nFor Scott McDonell, the Dane County clerk in the swing state of Wisconsin, it's been difficult to share accurate voting information on Facebook from his office's official government account, which only has 608 followers on Facebook. McDonell said his posts get very little traction compared with years past. \"If I link to a story about election security, three people will see it,\" McDonell said. Posts that include pictures do marginally better, he said, because \"Facebook likes pictures.\" \"Don't link to an article, that will go to zero,\" he said. McDonell said many of his colleagues have \"gotten abused\" so much on Facebook in recent years that they don't post about elections anymore. \"Basically, your average county clerk is terrified of it, and they just do it to share baby photos,\" McDonell said.\n\nwatch now\n\nIn Los Angeles County, Jeramy Gray, the chief deputy of the registrar-recorder/county clerk office, said small government offices often lack the resources needed to effectively utilize social media and to troubleshoot problems. Meta \"recently put a team together to assist\" his office, Gray said, adding that the company appears to be the \"most mature\" of the big platforms even if it's not a \"model partner.\" \"What I would like to see is just more engagement from them, at least three to four months from a large national election, for them to reach out to key stakeholders at the state and local level to really talk about what they can do or what they're doing,\" Gray said. Bowens, in North Carolina's Durham County, said the tech platforms could be much more helpful in assisting his office and others as they navigate through some of the confusion about what type of content is acceptable. Bowens said he's concerned about acting too aggressively because of potential censorship issues and recognizes there's a gray area between misinformation and citizens exercising their First Amendment rights. \"You know, we've got a very diverse election system in this country,\" Bowens said. \"What was on that post may very well be true in another state. Therefore, is it misinformation?\" WATCH: Sizing up Trump and Harris' economic plans",

        "text": "Trump vows to 'destroy' Iran if it harms a US election candidate, citing 'great threats' from the country\nRepublican presidential nominee, former U.S. President Donald Trump, during a campaign rally at the Mosack Group warehouse on September 25, 2024 in Mint Hill, North Carolina. BRANDON BELL / AFP\n\nDonald Trump said Wednesday, September 25, that Iran should be blown \"to smithereens\" if the Islamic Republic is involved in the harming of a US White House candidate or ex-president. The provocative remarks come after US intelligence warned of threats from Tehran against the Republican's life after two apparent assassination bids in recent months.\n\n\"As you know, there have been two assassination attempts on my life that we know of, and they may or may not involve \u2013 but possibly do \u2013 Iran,\" Trump said at a campaign event in North Carolina. \"If I were the president, I would inform the threatening country, in this case Iran, that if you do anything to harm this person, we are going to blow your largest cities and the country itself to smithereens,\" he added.\n\nTrump went on to say he and the United States have been \"threatened very directly by Iran\" and that a firm message needed to reach Tehran that there would be the most severe consequences should it be involved in plots to kill or hurt a US president or presidential candidate. \"The best way to do it is through the office of the president, that (if) you do any attacks on former presidents or candidates for president, your country gets blown to smithereens, as we say.\"\n\nTrump also said it was \"strange\" that Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian was in New York this week and accorded substantial protection as he attends the United Nations General Assembly even as news of the threats emerged. \"We have large security forces guarding him, and yet they're threatening our former president and the leading candidate to become the next president of the United States,\" Trump said, referring to himself.\n\nThe United States is obligated to extend security to foreign heads of state at the General Assembly under its treaty with the United Nations and its own laws.\n\n'Credible intelligence'\n\nTrump's remarks come as world leaders scramble to try to avert hostilities between Iran-backed Hezbollah and Israel escalating into a wider regional war. Iran has rejected accusations it is trying to kill Trump this summer, shortly after a gunman opened fire at a rally in Pennsylvania on July 13, killing one person and wounding the presidential candidate. Days later, Trump posted on social media that if Iran did kill him, \"I hope that America obliterates Iran, wipes it off the face of the Earth.\"\n\nIn a highly critical report on the security arrangements around Trump at the Pennsylvania rally, a US Senate committee noted that the deployment of elite US Secret Service countersnipers was made \"in response to 'credible intelligence' of a threat.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, the 78-year-old Trump suggested the would-be assassin in Pennsylvania had used \"potentially foreign-based apps,\" and that the alleged gunman in the second attempt in Florida had multiple mobile phones that Trump said US authorities have been unable to open. \"They must get Apple to open these foreign apps (and) open the six phones from the second lunatic,\" Trump said. \"Because we have a lot at stake.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, US Attorney General Merrick Garland called the attempted assassination bids \"abhorrent.\" \"Our nation has now experienced two assassination attempts against the former President in just the last three months. That is abhorrent,\" he said. \"The Justice Department will not tolerate violence that strikes at the heart of our democracy. And we will find and hold accountable those who perpetrate it. This must stop.\"\n\nIn August, the United States announced that it had foiled a plan by a Pakistani linked to Tehran to assassinate a US official in revenge for the death of Iranian general Qassem Soleimani, killed in 2020 in a US strike in Iraq ordered by then-president Trump. US intelligence services have also warned of attempted cyberattacks on the presidential campaigns of Trump and rival Kamala Harris by actors it says are backed by Iran.",

        "text": "How to Survive Election Season Without Losing Your Mind\nPolitical pundits would have a much easier job if they started predicting Americans\u2019 stress levels instead of the outcome of the presidential election. No margin of error needed\u2014it\u2019s easy to see we\u2019re all anxious. (Talk about unfavorable polling.)\n\nAccording to a recent American Psychiatric Association poll, 73% of adults in the U.S. are stressed about the race. A 2024 Pew Research Center survey concluded that 65% of Americans always or often feel exhausted when thinking about politics, while 55% report feeling angry. Politics triggers sleep loss, shortened tempers, and obsessive thoughts.\n\nAs researchers found last year, even election-related anticipatory stress\u2014like ruminating over the social gathering you\u2019re going to with people who support a different candidate\u2014can adversely affect health. \u201cIt has immediate consequences,\u201d says study author Shevaun Neupert, a professor in the department of psychology at NC State University. \u201cIt\u2019s getting under our skin in ways that are affecting our health on a day-to-day basis.\u201d Research has long suggested that stress can make people more susceptible to colds and the flu, as well as debilitating chronic illness. \u201cIf someone is having a strong reaction, and it\u2019s impeding their day-to-day functioning, it\u2019s important to talk to someone,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a very common experience\u2014but that doesn't mean it\u2019s a healthy one.\u201d\n\nWith that in mind, we asked experts to share strategies that can help us all survive election season, sanity intact.\n\nDo some problem-analysis\n\nWhile researching anticipatory election stress, Neupert landed on one particularly effective coping strategy: problem-analysis. \u201cIt\u2019s when people think critically about what they think will happen, and why they think it might happen,\u201d she says. \u201cLike, why is it you think you're going to have this argument about the election with an acquaintance tomorrow? And could you try to understand their perspective ahead of time?\u201d As you reflect on those questions, brainstorm how you\u2019ll respond to each point they bring up, she suggests, with the goal of preventing an argument and still engaging in a productive conversation.\n\nRead More: Do You Really Store Stress In Your Body?\n\nProblem-analysis helped Neupert\u2019s study participants protect themselves from the damaging effects of stress during the event they were worried about. \u201cThere was no significant decrease in their physical health,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re aware the messaging could be, \u2018Elections are stressful. People should just put their heads in the sand, and wait until it's all over\u2019\u2014which isn\u2019t great for democracy. So we\u2019re trying to understand ways that people can stay engaged but still preserve their mental and physical health.\u201d\n\nPut your thoughts on trial\n\nIn addition to brainstorming how you might handle future election-related stress, it can be helpful to challenge the existential fears you have around the presidential election. Colleen Marshall, chief clinical officer at the mental-health clinic Two Chairs, calls this technique\u2014which is common in cognitive behavioral therapy\u2014putting your thoughts on trial. Let\u2019s say you think life as you know it will go up in flames if the candidate you\u2019re pulling for doesn\u2019t win. First, ask yourself what evidence you have that that\u2019s true: \u201cYou\u2019ll have to hear their name for four years, and it's true they'll have an impact on policy, and some of those policies might impact your life,\u201d she says. But what evidence do you have that your belief your life will be over is not true? \u201cI\u2019d be like, \u2018Well, they probably won't impact who I'm married to, where I live, or where I go to dinner on Friday night. They're not going to impact what job I have, what I do for fun, or where I travel.\u2019\u201d Identifying \u201canxiety thoughts\u201d\u2014as opposed to factual thoughts\u2014typically quells people\u2019s nerves, Marshall says. She\u2019s found it\u2019s an effective antidote to catastrophizing and black-and-white thinking.\n\nSet boundaries around news consumption\n\nFor some people, not tuning into the news causes anxiety to swell. Others benefit from setting firm boundaries around media intake. \u201cYou can control how much news you're consuming, and how much you're letting it intrude into your daily life,\u201d Marshall says. For example, consider allowing yourself 30 minutes a day to catch up on the news, muting notifications from news apps, or turning off your phone one day a week.\n\nRead More: How to Stop Checking Your Phone Every 10 Seconds\n\nMarshall sometimes works with military families who have a loved one deployed, and she coaches them to designate a trusted person who funnels essential news to them. That way, they don\u2019t have to be glued to their screens, anxiously refreshing their apps to see if anything has changed. Closer to home, Marshall\u2019s husband is a history professor, so he likes to stay up-to-date on all things politics\u2014but she doesn't. \u201cI check in with him, like, \u2018Hey, anything going on?\u2019\u201d If there is, he lets her know: \u201cActually, you probably want to turn on the news because Biden stepped down and Harris is now running.\u201d Enlist a trusted friend to help you stick to your news consumption boundaries, too, she advises, and have a conversation about what warrants an update.\n\nPrune your social accounts\n\nSocial media has altered the way we get information during elections\u2014for both better and worse, says Dr. Laura Erickson-Schroth, chief medical officer of The Jed Foundation, a mental-health nonprofit. While information on platforms like Instagram is often appealing because it feels digestible, the algorithms driving these sites \u201ccan push us toward the same kind of content and opinions over and over,\u201d she points out. \u201cIt can be really stressful to see those same kinds of difficult issues raised repeatedly.\u201d That\u2019s especially true if you belong to a group of people worried about safety or rights, she adds\u2014and you\u2019re seeing, for example, frequent headlines about decreased support for LGBTQI people or immigrants.\n\nIt's important to acknowledge that \u201cthese apps are designed to deliver content that will get more likes and keep us on longer, and not necessarily provide useful information,\u201d Erickson-Schroth says. From there, take steps to make your social-media experience as healthy as possible: Set daily time limits, change up the accounts you\u2019re following, and search for particular topics you\u2019d like to see more of\u2014which will train the algorithm to send them your way. You can also log words and phrases that you don\u2019t want to see on Instagram, and you won\u2019t be shown any suggested posts in your feed that contain them.\n\nMake a plan for tricky conversations\n\nSpend time reflecting on what kind of personal boundaries you want to set around talking about politics. Inevitably, you\u2019ll encounter differences of opinion\u2014and things can get heated fast, Erickson-Schroth acknowledges. Before engaging in a conversation, she suggests asking yourself: \u201cAm I in the emotional headspace to have this conversation? Am I already feeling stressed out, on edge, or angry?\u201d If the answer is yes, change the subject.\n\nRead More: 8 Signs You\u2019re in Perimenopause\n\nIf you do choose to engage in a conversation with someone who has different political views, approach it with curiosity\u2014and the understanding that you probably won't change their mind, Erickson-Schroth says. If that's your goal, you're setting yourself up for disappointment. Instead, treat it as an opportunity to learn where they\u2019re coming from. If things start to dissolve, she recommends interjecting: \u201cThis conversation is really challenging for me. Could we talk about something else?\u201d\n\nCarve out time for whatever de-stresses you\n\nPrioritize relaxation\u2014whatever that might mean for you\u2014during the tumultuous months leading up to the election. \u201cWe need to do things we call wellness, like practicing mindfulness or being out in nature, and making sure to get enough sleep and exercise,\u201d Marshall says. \u201cAll the things that keep you balanced overall.\u201d\n\nIt can be helpful to reflect on how you successfully coped with tough times in the past, says Kristin Papa, a psychotherapist in San Jose, Calif. If you were waiting for your doctor to call with nerve-wracking test results, did you journal? Seek out social support? Take a long bath? \u201cMaybe you did physical activity to get the energy out,\u201d she says. \u201cMaking connections to past experiences can help you deal with this one\u2014I tell clients, \u2018Let\u2019s just turn the volume down.\u2019 It\u2019s finding a way to get to the point where you can live your life and do what you need to do,\u201d rather than becoming stuck in an election-related frenzy.\n\nFocus on what you can control\n\nMany people struggle with a lack of agency\u2014or feeling powerless, like you\u2019re \u201cjust one vote\u201d\u2014during election season. Reclaim a sense of control by getting involved, Erickson-Schroth suggests. Civic engagement promotes positive mental-health outcomes as well as a sense of social connectedness, including among young people, she says.\n\nRead More: 11 Things to Say to Persuade Someone to Vote\n\nWhat might that look like? Whatever speaks to you: You could write postcards encouraging people to vote, Papa says, or connect with local organizations about volunteer opportunities. Or, consider attending rallies, canvassing on behalf of your favorite candidate, or making a donation to an important cause. What matters most \u201cis realizing that you can\u2019t change everything, but you can do what you can within your own emotional capacity and time,\u201d she says.\n\nMake a plan for election night\n\nWe might not know who the next president of the United States is by midnight on Nov. 5\u2014but we\u2019ll likely be in for a tense evening as preliminary results are broadcast. If you know the stress will get to you, plan accordingly: Marshall, for instance, has a friend who goes on vacation every four years during election week. \u201cShe\u2019s already taken time off work, because in her mind, it\u2019s done; she voted. Like, \u2018Why am I here, just living through the anxiety?\u2019\u201d Marshall\u2019s friend knows herself well enough to understand she won't enjoy election night, so disconnecting from the news cycle suits her well.\n\nYou don't have to book a plane ticket to make election night more palatable. Marshall suggests thinking through who you want around you\u2014or whether you'd rather be alone to process the news\u2014and how you want to manage your nerves. (\u201cI probably would not recommend drinking,\u201d she clarifies. \u201cIt does relieve anxiety, but it\u2019s not the healthiest choice.\u201d) Consider planning activities you enjoy, like getting takeout from a favorite restaurant, doing a hot yoga class or pickleball session, or even buying some new candles to light around your living room.\n\nPractice radical acceptance\n\nNo matter how the election turns out, some segment of the population will be disappointed. If that\u2019s you, consider practicing radical acceptance, Marshall urges\u2014which means removing emotion from the situation, and accepting it for what it is. \u201cPart of our suffering is trying to argue away reality,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat's nice about the election results is once they're in and clear, you can just sort of accept reality: Factually, where are we? And then make your decision from that point of view.\u201d That might mean increasing your political activism, or on the flipside, tuning out politics altogether. But until then, do your best to keep your anxiety in check. \u201cWe don't actually know yet what the outcome is going to be,\u201d Marshall says. \u201cWhy are you planning for it today? It's not going to help.\u201d",

        "text": "What are the odds Trump will win? 2024 election betting odds, state by state\nThis story was updated to add new information.\n\nOffshore bettors think seven states with less than 100 electoral college votes between are the most likely to determine the presidential election.\n\nBased on bets made on Polymarket, a crypto trading platform, Vice President Kamala Harris had an edge of just 14 electoral college votes over former President Donald Trump as of Wednesday. For several hours on Thursday, two states \u2013 Pennsylvania and Nevada \u2013 with 25 votes combined had a 50% win probability for both candidates.\n\nIt should come as little surprise then that Polymarket bets suggest Harris' overall probability of winning the election is just two percentage points higher than Trump's as of Sept. 27 at 11 a.m. EDT. Presidential election betting can't be done legally in the United States.\n\nWho has better odds to win now:How the VP debate nudged the odds for Harris and Trump\n\nHarris' and Trump's election odds in every state\n\nOffshore bettors believe Harris and Trump have at least an 86% chance of winning a combined 43 states and Washington, D.C., in the Nov. 5 election.\n\nUnable to view our graphics? Click here to see them.\n\nReal Clear Politics, a nonpartisan election site, considers the seven states toss-ups where Trump or Harris have less than a 70% probability of winning. Their polling also adds to the toss-up mix Minnesota and one of Nebraska's five Electoral College votes, which bettors predict will go to Harris.\n\n2024 polling averages give Harris the edge in recent weeks\n\nLike the betting odds, polling averages synthesized by Real Clear Politics have risen about a percentage point in Harris' favor after the Sept. 10 debate. Trump's polling has been largely unchanged.\n\nViewed from the betting market's perspective, it's clear why both campaigns are spending so much time and money in Pennsylvania for its 19 electoral college votes. Even the betting money is divided there.\n\nWhere bettors think the 538 Electoral College votes will go\n\nMore than 4 of every 5 Electoral College votes are firmly in either candidate's camp, according to betting on Polymarket. When those 445 votes are allocated to either Trump or Harris, you see which the states will likely teeter between the candidates until November.\n\nAccording to Polymarket betting as of Friday at 11 a.m. EDT, Pennsylvania has a 51% chance of going to for Harris, and Nevada has a 52% chance. The day before, Trump's and Harris' odds were tied at 50%.\n\nHow Harris' and Trump's odds of winning the 2024 presidential election changed\n\nThe likelihood that Harris will win has swung as much as 8 percentage points in the days since Harris and Trump debated, according to Polymarket. Odds that they'll debate again have fallen 5 percentage points in the past week to 25%.\n\nIt's no wonder that Harris has risen into the front-runner position since the debate, when new betting pushed up her chances of winning in Pennsylvania and Nevada. Her odds in both states have since retreated.\n\nWhen is the vice presidential debate?\n\nWith about six weeks left before Election Day, next week could move betting markets again when Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz debates Republican Sen. JD Vance of Ohio. CBS News will host the debate Tuesday.\n\nBetting odds didn't predict Trump's 2016 victory\n\nThough the numbers have turned in Harris' favor, Trump remains only a percentage point away. That gap is much smaller than he has faced in betting markets during his two previous presidential runs, according to Betfair.\n\nBetfair odds had Hillary Clinton with an 81% likelihood of winning on Election Day in 2016. The betting favorite has lost only twice since 1866, according to the Conversation, a nonprofit news organization. The only other time bettors failed to predict the winner: 1948, when Democrat Harry Truman beat 8-to-1 odds to defeat Republican Thomas Dewey.\n\nContributing: James Powel",

        "text": "Three IRGC Cyber Actors Indicted for \u2018Hack-and-Leak\u2019 Operation Designed to Influence the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election\nNote: View the indictment here and the FBI Wanted Poster here.\n\nThe Justice Department today announced the unsealing of an indictment charging Iranian nationals, and Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) employees, Masoud Jalili, 36, also known as, \u0645\u0633\u0639\u0648\u062f \u062c\u0644\u06cc\u0644\u06cc, Seyyed Ali Aghamiri, 34, also known as, \u0633\u06cc\u062f \u0639\u0644\u06cc \u0622\u0642\u0627\u0645\u06cc\u0631\u06cc, and Yaser Balaghi, 37, also known as, \u06cc\u0627\u0633\u0631 \u0628\u0644\u0627\u063a\u06cc (the Conspirators), with a conspiracy with others known and unknown to hack into accounts of current and former U.S. officials, members of the media, nongovernmental organizations, and individuals associated with U.S. political campaigns. The activity was part of Iran\u2019s continuing efforts to stoke discord, erode confidence in the U.S. electoral process, and unlawfully acquire information relating to current and former U.S. officials that could be used to advance the malign activities of the IRGC, including ongoing efforts to avenge the death of Qasem Soleimani, the former commander of the IRGC \u2013 Qods Force (IRGC-QF).\n\nAs alleged, in or around May, after several years of focusing on compromising the accounts of former U.S. government officials, the conspirators used some of the same hacking infrastructure from earlier in the conspiracy to begin targeting and successfully gaining unauthorized access to personal accounts belonging to persons associated with an identified U.S. Presidential campaign (U.S. Presidential Campaign 1), including campaign officials. The conspirators used their access to those accounts to steal, among other information, non-public campaign documents and emails (campaign material). The activity broadened in late June, when the conspirators engaged in a \u201chack-and-leak\u201d operation, in which they sought to weaponize campaign material stolen from U.S. Presidential Campaign 1 by leaking such materials to members of the media and individuals associated with what was then another identified U.S. Presidential campaign (U.S. Presidential Campaign 2), in a deliberate effort to, as reflected in the conspirators\u2019 own words and actions, undermine U.S. Presidential Campaign 1 in advance of the 2024 U.S. presidential election.\n\n\u201cThe Justice Department is working relentlessly to uncover and counter Iran\u2019s cyberattacks aimed at stoking discord, undermining confidence in our democratic institutions, and influencing our elections,\u201d said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. \u201cThe American people \u2013 not Iran, or any other foreign power \u2013 will decide the outcome of our country\u2019s elections.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s charges represent the culmination of a thorough and long-running FBI investigation that has resulted in the indictment of three Iranian nationals for their roles in a wide-ranging hacking campaign sponsored by the Government of Iran,\u201d said FBI Director Christopher Wray. \u201cThe conduct laid out in the indictment is just the latest example of Iran\u2019s brazen behavior. So today the FBI would like to send a message to the Government of Iran \u2013 you and your hackers can\u2019t hide behind your keyboards.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese hack-and-leak efforts by Iran are a direct assault on the integrity of our democratic processes,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen of the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division. \u201cIranian government actors have long sought to use cyber-enabled means to harm U.S. interests. This case demonstrates our commitment to expose attempts by the Iranian regime or any other foreign actor to interfere with our free and open society.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis indictment alleges a serious and sustained effort by a state-sponsored terrorist organization to gather intelligence through hacking personal accounts so they can use the hacked materials to harm Americans and corruptly influence our election,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Matthew Graves for the District of Columbia. \u201cThe detailed allegations in the indictment should make clear to anyone who might attempt to do the same that the Justice Department has the ability to gather evidence of such crimes from around the globe, will charge those who commit such crimes, and will do whatever we can to bring those charged to justice.\u201d\n\nAs alleged in the indictment, beginning in or around January 2020, Jalili, Aghamiri, and Balaghi, working on behalf of the IRGC, commenced a wide-ranging hacking campaign that used spearphishing and social engineering techniques to target and compromise victims computers and accounts. Among the conspirators\u2019 techniques were: using virtual private networks and virtual private servers to obscure their true location; creating fraudulent email accounts in the names of prominent U.S. persons and international institutions; creating spoofed login pages to harvest account credentials; sending spearphishing emails using compromised victim accounts; and using social engineering to obtain victims\u2019 login information and multi-factor recovery/authentication codes. Some of the conspirators\u2019 efforts were successful, while others were not.\n\nIn April 2019, the Department of State designated the IRGC as a foreign terrorist organization. Among the purposes of the conspiracy were for the conspirators to: (i) steal victims\u2019 data, such as information related to U.S. government and foreign policy information concerning the Middle East; (ii) steal information relating to current and former U.S. officials that could be used to advance the IRGC\u2019s malign activities; (iii) disrupt U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East; (iv) stoke discord and erode confidence in the U.S. electoral process; (v) steal personal and private information from persons who had access to information relating to U.S. Presidential Campaign 1, including non-public campaign material and information; and (vi) undermine U.S. Presidential Campaign 1 in advance of the 2024 U.S. presidential election by leaking stolen campaign material and information.\n\nAs reflected in the Sept. 18 joint statement released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, FBI, and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency: \u201cIranian malicious cyber actors in late June and early July sent unsolicited emails to individuals then associated with President Biden\u2019s campaign that contained an excerpt taken from stolen, non-public material from former Trump\u2019s campaign as text in the emails. There is currently no information indicating those recipients replied. Furthermore, Iranian malicious cyber actors have continued their efforts since June to send stolen, non-public material associated with former President Trump\u2019s campaign to U.S. media organizations.\u201d\n\nAs alleged in further detail in the indictment, the conspirators\u2019 hack-and-leak efforts involved the conspirators emailing stolen campaign material to individuals that the conspirators believed were associated with what was then U.S. Presidential Campaign 2 and members of the media.\n\nFirst, between on or about June 27 and July 3, the conspirators sent or forwarded an unsolicited email message to personal accounts of three persons that the conspirators believed were associated with U.S. Presidential Campaign 2. The June 27 email was sent to two recipients, and then forwarded the same day to another account for one of those recipients (due to the earlier email being sent to an invalid account for that recipient). This email chain contained campaign material stolen from an official for U.S. Presidential Campaign 1 (U.S. Victim 11). Neither of the recipients replied to the conspirators\u2019 email. In addition, the conspirators sent a follow up email on July 3rd to a third recipient\u2019s account, and the recipient similarly did not reply to the Conspirators.\n\nSecond, between on or about July 22 and on or about Aug. 31, the conspirators distributed other campaign material stolen from U.S. Victim 11 regarding U.S. Presidential Campaign 1\u2019s potential vice-presidential candidates to multiple members of the news media, in an attempt to induce the news media to publish the material. In one instance, for example, the conspirators\u2019 message stated \u201cI think this information is worth a good [U.S. news publication] piece with your narration. Let me know your thoughts.\u201d\n\nAs alleged, these defendants also sought to promote the IRGC\u2019s goals and mission by compromising and maintaining unauthorized access to the email accounts of a number of former government officials, including U.S. Victim 1, who had served in a position with responsibility over U.S. Middle East policy at the time of Qasam Soleimani\u2019s death. Using this access, the defendants obtained information to assist the IRGC\u2019s efforts to target U.S. Victim 1 and others, including their means of identification, correspondence, travel information, lodging information and other information regarding their whereabouts and policy positions.\n\nJalili, Aghamiri, and Balaghi are charged with: conspiracy to commit identity theft, aggravated identity theft, access device fraud, unauthorized access to computers to obtain information from a protected computer, unauthorized access to computers to defraud and obtain a thing of value, and wire fraud, all while knowingly falsely registering domain names, which carries a maximum penalty of 12 years in prison; conspiracy to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization, which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison; eight counts of wire fraud while falsely registering domain names, each of which carries a maximum penalty of 27 years in prison; and eight counts of aggravated identity theft, each of which carries a mandatory minimum penalty of two years in prison. If convicted, a federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.\n\nConcurrent with today\u2019s announcement, the Department of State, through the Rewards for Justice Program, issued a reward of up to $10 million for information on Jalili, Aghamiri, and Balaghi, the IRGC\u2019s interference in U.S. elections, or associated individuals and entities. Also, concurrent with today\u2019s announcement, the Department of the Treasury, Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC), pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13694, as amended, and E.O. 13848 designated Jalili for being responsible for or complicit in, or having engaged in, directly or indirectly, a cyber-enabled activity originating from, or directed by persons located, in whole or in substantial part, outside the United States that is reasonably likely to result in, or has materially contributed to, a significant threat to the national security, foreign policy, or economic health or financial stability of the United States and that has the purpose or effect of causing a significant misappropriation of funds or economic resources, trade secrets, personal identifiers, or financial information for commercial or competitive advantage or private financial gain.\n\nThe FBI Washington Field Office is investigating this case. The FBI Cyber Division and Springfield and Minneapolis Field Offices provided substantial assistance in this matter. For more information on threat activity as well as mitigation guidance, the FBI has released a Joint Cyber Security Advisory titled \u201cIranian Cyber Actors Targeting Personal Accounts to Support Operations.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department would like to thank the following private sector partners for their assistance with this case: Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and Meta.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorneys Tejpal Chawla and Christopher Tortorice for the District of Columbia and Trial Attorney Greg Nicosia of the National Security Division\u2019s National Security Cyber Section are prosecuting the case, with significant assistance from Paralegal Specialists Mariela Andrade and Kate Abrey. Joshua Champagne of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterterrorism Section also provided valuable assistance.\n\nAn indictment is merely an allegation. All defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.",

        "text": "Why can the US election vote count take so long? What to know in 500 words\nWhen will we know how many votes were cast for Republican candidate Donald Trump and Democratic candidate Kamala Harris in the United States presidential election on November 5?\n\nIt depends \u2014 and that\u2019s normal.\n\nIn the US, there is no federal vote-counting process. Instead, counting procedures are left up to the states, and it potentially can take weeks for a final official tally to be released.\n\nHowever, a clear presidential winner typically emerges within hours or days of polls closing on election day.\n\nThe lag between media organisations \u201ccalling\u201d an election, and the official certification process can be confusing to voters.\n\nIt can also be fertile ground for election misinformation, including the false election fraud claims that Trump has continued to spread since 2020.\n\nHow do we know the winner before all the votes are counted?\n\nNews organisations have developed complex methodologies to estimate when a presidential candidate no longer has a path to victory in the Electoral College.\n\nThe Electoral College is the system that decides presidential elections: A candidate must secure at least 270 Electoral College votes \u2013 which are allocated by state based on the outcome of their respective vote \u2013 to win the White House.\n\nNews outlets effectively \u201ccall\u201d each state for a presidential hopeful based on their methodologies, and those projections predict the overall winner.\n\nAl Jazeera relies on The Associated Press, a news agency that has been calling elections for more than 170 years in the US, for this process.\n\nDepending on how tight a race is, AP can sometimes determine a victor swiftly while other times it can take days.\n\nFor example, it did not declare Democrat Joe Biden the winner of the 2020 vote until four days after election day. It took another 16 days to determine that Biden was the winner in the state of Georgia.\n\nOK, but how does the official count work?\n\nAll states allow votes to be cast in some form either in the lead-up to election day or on election day itself.\n\nIn some states, mail-in ballots can be verified ahead of time and then rapidly tabulated on election day, often through automated systems.\n\nBut others prohibit any processing until election day itself, which can lead to a time-consuming backlog.\n\nStates then have varying periods of time to self-audit the results. A recount can also be requested in most states depending on the vote margin, while others give voters time to correct a mistake \u2013 or \u201ccure\u201d a ballot.\n\nUltimately, state executives must issue so-called Certificates of Ascertainment showing the official, final vote tally by a specific date. This year, the deadline is December 11.\n\nThe president-elect\u2019s victory then is officially certified by Congress in January.\n\nWhy is this controversial?\n\nTight races in key battleground states in 2020 \u2013 as well as an increase in mail-in voting amid the COVID pandemic \u2013 saw particularly slow vote counts.\n\nThat helped fuel unfounded claims of election malfeasance pushed by Trump and his allies.\n\nThose false claims were furthered aided by the fact that Democrats typically vote more by mail-in ballots than Republicans.\n\nAs a result, in states where there are delays in counting those mail-in ballots, people can get the impression that there has been a late surge in Democratic votes \u2013 also known as a \u201cblue shift\u201d.\n\nTo counter misinformation, election experts have called on states to shore up their vote-counting processes.\n\nWhile some key battleground states have done so, others \u2013 such as Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Georgia \u2013 have done little to assure a speedier process this year.\n\nGeorgia\u2019s election board has even moved to require hand counts of votes on election day, which experts warn could cause even more significant delays.",

        "text": "Trump and Harris Supporters Differ on Mass Deportations but Favor Border Security, High-Skilled Immigration\nMajority of Trump backers say more immigrants would make life worse for people like them; most Harris backers say life wouldn\u2019t change\n\nHow we did this Pew Research Center conducted this study to understand Americans\u2019 views on immigration and immigration policy prior to the 2024 presidential election.\n\nFor this analysis, we surveyed 9,201 adults \u2013 including 7,569 registered voters \u2013 from Aug. 5 to 11, 2024. Everyone who took part in this survey is a member of the Center\u2019s American Trends Panel (ATP), a group of people recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses who have agreed to take surveys regularly. This kind of recruitment gives nearly all U.S. adults a chance of selection. Surveys were conducted either online or by telephone with a live interviewer. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other factors. Read more about the ATP\u2019s methodology.\n\n\n\nHere are the questions used for the report, the topline and its methodology.\n\nTerminology Harris supporters are respondents who said they would vote for Kamala Harris, the Democrat, if the 2024 presidential election were held today, or those who said they would not vote for any of the candidates but lean toward Harris. Trump supporters are respondents who said they would vote for Donald Trump, the Republican, if the 2024 presidential election were held today, or those who said they would not vote for any of the candidates but lean toward Trump.\n\nIn a presidential race where immigration has become a key and contentious issue, a Pew Research Center survey shows wide differences and common ground on immigration policy among registered voters who support Donald Trump and Kamala Harris.\n\nThe candidates have taken sometimes sharply different positions on immigration issues that divide their supporters:\n\nNearly nine-in-ten Trump supporters (88%) favor mass deportations of immigrants living in the country illegally. In contrast, only 27% of Harris supporters favor mass deportations while 72% oppose.\n\nMore than a third of Trump supporters (37%) favor allowing undocumented immigrants to live and work in the U.S. if they are married to an American citizen, compared with 80% of Harris supporters who say the same.\n\nAbout half of Trump supporters (49%) support admitting more civilian refugees who are escaping war or violence, but a majority of Harris supporters (85%) say the same.\n\nOn other immigration issues, Trump and Harris supporters share more common ground:\n\nImproving border security is supported by large majorities of both Trump supporters (96%) and Harris supporters (80%).\n\nAdmitting more high-skilled immigrants is favored by 71% of Trump supporters and 87% of Harris supporters.\n\nThese findings come from a bilingual, nationally representative survey of 9,201 adults \u2013 including 7,569 registered voters \u2013 conducted Aug. 5-11, 2024, ahead of the Democratic National Convention and about a month before the Sept. 10 presidential debate.\n\nThe U.S. immigrant population has grown sharply over the decades, from 9.6 million in 1970 to 31.1 million in 2000 and almost 48 million in 2023. These totals account for immigrants in the country both legally and illegally.\n\nImmigrants make up about 14.3% of the nation\u2019s population, a near-record high. They are dispersed across all states and metro areas. And nearly three-quarters of registered voters say they know someone who was born outside of the United States, according to the survey.\n\nTrump supporters have a more negative view than Harris supporters on the impact of immigrants on their lives. A majority of Trump supporters (59%) say that the increasing number of immigrants will make things worse for people like them. But a majority of Harris supporters (65%) say that the increasing number of immigrants will make no difference in their lives, with only 11% saying it will make life worse for people like them.\n\nTrump supporters have a mixed view about the impact of legal immigration on the country. A majority say immigrants living in the country legally either make the economy better (31%) or don\u2019t have much of an effect on it (38%), while 29% say these immigrants make the economy worse. By contrast, a clear majority of Harris supporters (62%) say immigrants living in the U.S. legally make the economy better.\n\nTrump supporters have a much more negative view of the impact of illegal immigration. An overwhelming majority of Trump supporters (92%) say immigrants living in the country illegally make crime worse, compared with 37% of Harris supporters.\n\nNotably, American voters have become less likely than in recent years to say undocumented immigrants should be allowed to stay in the country. About six-in-ten U.S. registered voters (59%) in the new survey say undocumented immigrants should be allowed to stay in the country legally if certain requirements are met, down from 77% who said the same in 2017. Most Harris supporters (87%) say that there should be a way for undocumented immigrants to stay in the country legally, compared with only a third of Trump supporters (33%).\n\nIn the 2024 presidential race, Trump supporters place far more importance on immigration than Harris supporters. For Trump supporters, 82% say immigration is very important to their vote in the 2024 presidential election, trailing only the economy in importance, according to a Center survey conducted in late August to early September. By contrast, just 39% of Harris supporters say the issue of immigration is very important to their presidential vote this year, behind all other issues asked about in the survey, including health care, Supreme Court appointments, the economy, abortion, gun policy and climate change.\n\nImmigration to U.S. has rebounded from pandemic-era lows\n\nLegal immigration to the U.S. has started to increase after a steep decline during the COVID-19 outbreak, according to Center analysis of data from the Department of Homeland Security. In 2023, about 1.1 million immigrants became lawful permanent residents of the U.S., a return to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nIn addition, a record number of immigrants crossed the U.S.-Mexico border without authorization at the end of 2023, though these flows have since dropped sharply. Both Republicans and Democrats have been critical of the way the government has handled the situation at the U.S. Mexico border.\n\nOverall, confidence in the Biden administration\u2019s handling of immigration has declined among both Republicans and Democrats. In July, 35% of American voters had confidence in Joe Biden to make wise decisions about immigration. By September, more voters had confidence in Trump (52%) on this issue than in Harris (45%) \u2013 though confidence in Harris is higher than it was in Biden.\n\nViews on government control over illegal and legal immigration\n\nIn the new survey, two-thirds of Trump supporters (66%) say the U.S. government has little or no control over immigrants entering the country illegally, while fewer than half (40%) of Harris supporters say the same.\n\nBy contrast, about half of both Trump (49%) and Harris (51%) supporters say the federal government has complete or almost complete control over immigrants entering country legally. Somewhat similar shares of Trump and Harris supporters (30% and 37%, respectively) say the government has a moderate degree of control over legal immigration.\n\nOverall, 33% of Trump supporters say the government has at least a moderate degree of control over legal immigration, compared with 59% of Harris supporters.\n\nDespite agreement over the government\u2019s control of legal immigration, about three-quarters of both Trump (74%) and Harris (76%) supporters say the U.S. immigration system needs major changes or needs to be completely rebuilt.\n\nViews on the level of illegal and legal immigration into the U.S.\n\nTrump supporters express far higher levels of concern than Harris supporters about illegal immigration. Most Trump supporters (87%) say they are very or extremely concerned about the number of immigrants entering the country illegally, while about a quarter of Harris supporters (27%) say the same.\n\nJust over a third of Harris supporters say they are somewhat concerned (36%) about this, while a similar share (37%) say they are not concerned about the number of immigrants entering the country illegally.\n\nTrump and Harris supporters are less divided on the levels of legal immigration into the U.S. Nearly half of both Trump and Harris supporters say legal immigration should be kept at its present level \u2013 48% and 44%, respectively.\n\nBut support differs when it comes to changing the level of legal immigration into the U.S. A third of Trump supporters (33%) favor decreased legal immigration, and smaller shares (17%) say it should be increased. Meanwhile, about four-in-ten Harris supporters (42%) favor increased legal immigration, with smaller shares favoring decreased immigration levels.\n\nHow do registered voters view the impact of immigrants on U.S. society?\n\nAbout three-quarters of U.S. immigrants are here legally, and about a quarter are unauthorized immigrants.\n\nRegistered voters draw a distinction between immigrants living in the country illegally and legally when it comes to the impact immigrants have on society. For example, a majority of registered voters say that immigrants living in the country illegally have negative impacts on public resources (70%) and on crime (64%). By contrast, nearly half of voters say that immigrants living in the country legally have a positive impact on U.S. economy.\n\nThe impact of immigrants living in the country illegally\n\nMajorities of Trump supporters say immigrants living in the country illegally make things worse when it comes to crime (92%), public resources like housing, education or health care (92%), the U.S. economy (85%) and social and cultural values (76%).\n\nHarris supporters have a mix of positive and negative views about the impact of immigrants living in the country illegally.\n\n56% of Harris supporters say immigrants living in the country illegally don\u2019t have much effect on crime, with 37% saying they make things worse.\n\n38% of Harris supporters say immigrants in the country illegally make things better for the U.S. economy, while 32% say they don\u2019t have much of an effect and 28% say they make things worse.\n\n49% say immigrants living in the country illegally make things worse when it comes to public resources, while 40% say they don\u2019t have much an effect.\n\nShould immigrants living in the country illegally be eligible for public assistance?\n\nUnauthorized immigrants are ineligible for most federally funded public benefits. And immigrant eligibility for public assistance differs across state and local levels. For example, California offers financial aid to unauthorized immigrant students, while Minnesota will soon allow unauthorized immigrants to access health insurance coverage offered to low-income residents.\n\nSurvey findings show that a majority (81%) of voters say immigrants who are living in the U.S. illegally should not be eligible for public assistance.\n\nNearly all Trump supporters (96%) say immigrants living in the country illegally should not be eligible for public assistance from state and local governments. A majority of Harris supporters (68%) say the same, while nearly a third (31%) say immigrants living in the country illegally should be eligible for public assistance.\n\nThe impact of immigrants living in the country legally\n\nHarris supporters are more likely than Trump supporters to say immigrants living in the country legally improve the U.S. economy, science and technological innovation, and social and cultural values.\n\n62% of Harris supporters say immigrants living in the country legally make things better for the U.S. economy, compared with 31% of Trump supporters.\n\n57% of Harris supporters say immigrants living in the country legally make things better for science and technological innovation, compared with 33% of Trump supporters.\n\nNotably, a majority of registered voters (62%) say immigrants living in the country legally do not have much effect on crime, with 71% of Harris supporters and 53% of Trump supporters saying so. Still, 36% of Trump supporters say legal immigrants make crime worse.\n\nSizable shares of Trump supporters (42%) and Harris supporters (52%) say immigrants living in the country legally do not have much effect on public resources such as housing, education or health care.\n\nShould immigrants living in the country legally be eligible for public assistance?\n\nNotably, majorities of both Trump (69%) and Harris (89%) supporters say legal immigrants should be eligible for public assistance by state and local governments, reflecting their markedly different views on immigrants living in the country legally and those in the country illegally.",

        "text": "September 27, 2024, presidential campaign news\nWith the days ticking down to the presidential election, there is a lot of activity on and off the campaign trail as the candidates and their allies jostle to the finish line.\n\nSome of those moments had people talking more than others, especially online.\n\nHere are some of the newsy moments this week:\n\n\u201cYour favorite artist\u2019s favorite artist\u201d will vote for Harris\n\nPop star Chappell Roan said in a TikTok video Wednesday that she planned to vote for Harris in November, ending days of speculation after she told the Guardian in an interview published Friday that \u201cthere\u2019s problems on both sides.\u201d\n\nThe saga marks the latest example of the tightrope celebrities in the age of TikTok and social media have had to tread in voicing their support \u2014 or silence \u2014 on politics.\n\nTrump to women: \u201cI am your protector\u201d\n\nFormer President Donald Trump cast himself as a \u201cprotector\u201d of women at a Pennsylvania rally Monday evening and claimed that American women won\u2019t be \u201cthinking about abortion\u201d if he\u2019s elected.\n\nThe plea to ignore Trump\u2019s own role in undoing national abortion rights protections is a clear signal that the former president is keenly aware of what polls show: His Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, has a clear advantage among women voters, nationally and in key swing states. Trump has kept the race close by countering with a lead among men.\n\nHarris said Wednesday that women don\u2019t need Trump to be their \u201cprotector,\u201d but instead need the former president \u201cto trust them\u201d to make their own reproductive decisions.\n\nContentious Georgia election meeting\n\nThe Georgia State Election Board meeting became contentious on Monday after two members defended their reasons for approving a controversial new rule that requires county election officials to hand-count the number of ballots on Election Day.\n\nAfter a speech by Dr. Janice Johnson, one of the Republicans who voted to approve the rule, there was a contentious back-and-forth between Republican Janelle King, a media personality who is the board\u2019s newest member, and Sara Tindall Ghazal, the board\u2019s lone sitting Democrat. King took issue with Ghazal\u2019s appearance on MSNBC, where she questioned her colleagues\u2019 agendas.\n\nClick here to read more about the tense meeting and what other Georgia officials are saying about the rule\u2019s uncertain legal future.\n\nEncouraging voting in a battleground state \u2014 with a \u201cbob-shullet\u201d\n\nTikTok\u2019s newest political style icon: Brenda Pollard, a delegate for the North Carolina Democrats. She may not be nationally known, but because of her distinctive style and sense of humor, another video she made with content creator and comedian Lauren Howard Hayes went viral on the platform late last week, racking up more than 145,000 views. In the video on Hayes\u2019 account, Hayes is dressed in a wig that cut to look like Pollard\u2019s \u2014 what appears to be a bob with bangs in the front and longer hair in the back, which Hayes has nicknamed a \u201cbob-shullet.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love your hair, Brenda,\u201d Pollard says in the video before it cuts to a clip of Hayes.\n\n\u201cI love your hair, Brenda,\u201d she says back. \u201cGet ready for us to go vote.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the latest in a series of videos Pollard has participated in with Hayes, encouraging Americans to vote for Harris in November. In the caption of one of the first videos that Pollard appears in, Hayes writes that the North Carolina Democrats put them in touch after several videos of Hayes poking fun at Pollard on Spectrum News got hundreds of thousands of views each.\n\n\u201cIn the front, we call this sweet tea, but in the back\u2026\u201d Pollard says of her haircut. \u201cOh, it\u2019s moonshine,\u201d Hayes finishes.\n\nNorth Carolina is an important battleground state for both campaigns.\n\nCNN\u2019s Kate Sullivan and Eric Bradner contributed reporting to this post.",

        "text": "Final Opportunities to Return Voted Ballots\nSeptember 27, 2024\n\nReturn your voted ballot now!\n\nRemember, U.S. embassies and consulates are not polling places. Same-day, in-person voting is not available outside the United States. Many states require voted ballots to reach local election officials by the time polls close on election day (November 5). U.S. citizens who want to participate in the 2024 U.S. elections from overseas should have already returned their absentee ballots to their local election officials.\n\nNever received your ballot?\n\nIf you registered to vote and requested an absentee ballot prior to your state\u2019s registration deadline, but have not yet received your ballot, you can complete and return a Federal Write-in Absentee Ballot (FWAB) and return it to your local election office. The FWAB is available at www.FVAP.gov. If your regular ballot arrives later, complete and return it as well. Your FWAB will only be counted if your regular ballot does not reach local election officials by your state\u2019s deadline. Your vote will not be counted twice.\n\nRETURNING YOUR BALLOT: If you plan to drop your ballot off at the embassy or consulate to be returned to your local election office, we recommend you do so no later than October 4. Please ensure your ballot is addressed to your local election officials and is either placed in a postage-paid envelope or bears sufficient domestic U.S. postage. Ballots can be dropped off, from 9:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday (excluding these holidays).\n\nMissed the U.S. embassy or consulate shipment deadline?\n\nIf your state allows, you may be able to return your voted ballot to your local election office electronically. You can also consider returning your ballot via an express courier service at your own expense. Ballots sent via express courier do not receive standard postmarks, so voters using this method should confirm delivery on or before November 5 prior to payment and shipment. Check your state\u2019s voting procedures at www.FVAP.gov for guidance.\n\nIf you have previously registered to vote and requested an absentee ballot but it has not yet arrived, some states allow voters to email or fax their voted, signed FWAB to local election officials. Review your state\u2019s voting procedures at www.FVAP.gov carefully for guidance.\n\nReturning your ballot by international mail.\n\nIf using Italy\u2019s postal system, be sure to include sufficient international postage and allow enough time for delivery. Ballots sent via regular international mail at this time are unlikely to reach local election officials by state ballot receipt deadlines.\n\nHELP SPREAD THE WORD ABOUT OVERSEAS VOTING.\n\nPlease help spread the word to your friends, family, and colleagues that now is the time return your ballot if you are voting from overseas.\n\nNeed help?\n\nYou can get in-person voting assistance from the embassy/consulate, and ballots can be dropped off, from 9:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday (excluding these holidays).\n\nHave Questions?\n\nPlease contact Italy\u2019s Voting Assistance Officer at +39 06 46741 or at voterome@state.gov. You can also contact the Federal Voting Assistance Program (FVAP) directly at Vote@FVAP.gov.\n\nConfirm your registration and ballot delivery online. Learn more at the FVAP website at www.FVAP.gov.\n\nIf you have any questions about registering to vote overseas or how to return your election materials, please contact your nearest embassy or consulate:\n\nU.S. Embassy Rome, Italy\n\nVia Vittorio Veneto, 121\n\n+39 06-46741\n\nVoteRome@state.gov\n\nhttps://it.usembassy.gov/\n\nU.S. Consulate General Milan, Italy\n\nVia Principe Amadeo, 2/10\n\n+39 02-290-351\n\nVoteMilan@state.gov\n\nU.S. Consulate General Florence, Italy\n\nLungarno Vespucci, 38\n\n+39 055-266-951\n\nVoteFlorence@state.gov\n\nU.S. Consulate General Naples, Italy\n\nPiazza della Repubblica\n\n+39 081-583-8111\n\nVoteNaples@state.gov\n\n888-407-4747 or 202-501-4444",

        "text": "Iranian operatives charged in the US with hacking Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Three Iranian operatives have been charged with hacking Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign as part of what the Justice Department says was a sweeping effort to undermine the former president and erode confidence in the U.S. electoral system.\n\nThe action, coupled with sanctions and rewards for information leading to the accused hackers\u2019 capture, is the latest U.S. government effort to call out what\u2019s seen as Iran\u2019s attempts to interfere in the election by damaging Trump and sowing general chaos. It comes as Iran has also been accused of threatening the lives of Trump and former officials and as US-Iran relations remain especially tense, with Israel fighting Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon.\n\nThe three accused hackers were employed by Iran\u2019s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, which the U.S. government has designated as a foreign terrorist organization. Since 2020, their operation has sought to compromise email accounts of a broad swath of targets, which in addition to the Trump campaign also includes a former ambassador to Israel, a former CIA deputy director, officials at the State and Defense departments, a former U.S. homeland security adviser and journalists, according to the indictment.\n\nIn May, prosecutors say, the defendants began trying to penetrate the Trump campaign, successfully breaking into the email accounts of campaign officials and other Trump allies. They then sought to \u201cweaponize\u201d the stolen campaign material by spreading it to media organizations and people associated with President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign in what\u2019s familiarly known as a \u201chack-and-leak\u201d operation.\n\n\u201cThe defendants\u2019 own words make clear that they were attempting to undermine former President Trump\u2019s campaign in advance of the 2024 U.S. presidential election. We know that Iran is continuing with its brazen efforts to stoke discord, erode confidence in the U.S. electoral process and advance its malign activities,\u201d Attorney General Merrick Garland said at a news conference Friday announcing the charges.\n\nWhat to know about Trump\u2019s second term:\n\nStaffing the administration: Here are the people Trump has picked recess appointments Follow all of our coverage as Donald Trump assembles his second administration.\n\nU.S. intelligence officials have said Iran opposes Trump\u2019s reelection, seeing him as more likely to increase tension between Washington and Tehran. Trump\u2019s administration ended a nuclear deal with Iran, reimposed sanctions and ordered the killing of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, an act that prompted Iran\u2019s leaders to vow revenge.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign said earlier this week that it had been briefed by U.S. officials on \u201creal and specific\u201d Iranian assassination threats, though one official told The Associated Press that the briefing had been requested by the campaign and did not include any suggestion of a new threat against Trump.\n\nIran\u2019s mission to the United Nations last month denied the hacking allegations as \u201cunsubstantiated and devoid of any standing,\u201d saying that Iran had neither the motive nor intention to interfere with the election. It challenged the U.S. to provide evidence and said if the U.S. does so, \u201cwe will respond accordingly.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. government has sought this year across multiple agencies to aggressively call out election interference and foreign influence operations \u2014 a stark turnabout from the government\u2019s response in 2016, when Obama administration officials were criticized for not being forthcoming about the Russian interference they were seeing on Trump\u2019s behalf as he ran against Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe Treasury Department issued sanctions Friday related to the hacking and the State Department offered rewards of up to $10 million for information leading to the arrests of the defendants, who remain in Iran.\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray said in a video statement that the FBI has been working to publicly condemn Iran\u2019s \u201caggressive behavior,\u201d including a plot to murder a journalist in New York City and a ransomware attack targeting a children\u2019s hospital.\n\nEven with the recent focus on Iran, U.S. officials have said Russia remains the primary threat to the elections.\n\nThe Justice Department earlier this month charged two employees of RT, the Russian-state media organization, with covertly funding a Tennessee-based content creation company with nearly $10 million to publish English-language videos on social media platforms favorable to Russia\u2019s interests and agenda, and also seized dozens of internet domains that officials said were used to spread propaganda.\n\nThe Trump campaign disclosed on Aug. 10 that it had been breached and said Iranian actors had stolen and distributed sensitive internal documents.\n\nMultiple major news organizations that said they were leaked confidential information from inside the Trump campaign, including Politico, The New York Times and The Washington Post, declined to publish it.\n\nU.S. intelligence officials subsequently publicly blamed Iran for that hack and for an attempted breach of the Joe Biden-Kamala Harris campaign.\n\nThey have said the hack-and-dump operation was meant to sow discord, exploit divisions within American society and potentially influence the outcome of elections that Iran perceives to be \u201cparticularly consequential in terms of the impact they could have on its national security interests.\u201d\n\nAmong the tactics the accused hackers used, the indictment said, is impersonating U.S. officials and creating fake email personas to try to dupe their victims.\n\nPolitico has reported that it began receiving emails on July 22 from an anonymous account. The source \u2014 an AOL email account identified only as \u201cRobert\u201d \u2014 passed along what appeared to be a research dossier that the campaign had apparently done on the Republican vice presidential nominee, Ohio Sen. JD Vance. The document was dated Feb. 23, almost five months before Trump selected Vance as his running mate.\n\nLast week, officials also revealed that the Iranians in late June and early July sent unsolicited emails containing excerpts of the hacked information to people associated with the Biden campaign. None of the recipients replied. The Harris campaign said the emails resembled spam or a phishing attempt and condemned the outreach by the Iranians as \u201cunwelcome and unacceptable malicious activity.\u201d\n\nOne of the emails was sent June 27, the date of the Biden-Trump debate, when a halting performance by the president laid the groundwork for his announcement weeks later that he would not seek reelection. An email offering the stolen information, according to the indictment, stated that the debate was likely to be Biden\u2019s \u201clast chance\u201d in the race.\n\nThe author stated negative feelings for Trump and wrote, \u201cSo I\u2019m going to pass some materials along to you that would be useful to defeat him.\u201d",

        "text": "Trump favors huge new tariffs. How do they work?\nThis week, a report from the Peterson Institute for International Economics concluded that Trump\u2019s main tariff proposals \u2013 assuming that the targeted countries retaliated with their own tariffs \u2014 would slash more than a percentage point off the U.S. economy by 2026 and make inflation 2 percentage points higher next year than it otherwise would have been.\n\nMainstream economists are generally skeptical of tariffs, considering them a mostly inefficient way for governments to raise money and promote prosperity. They are especially alarmed by Trump\u2019s latest proposed tariffs.\n\nAnd he threatened to hit Mexican-made goods with 100% tariffs, a move that would risk blowing up a trade deal that Trump\u2019s own administration negotiated with Canada and Mexico.\n\nThis week, he raised the ante still higher. To punish the machinery manufacturer John Deere for its plans to move some production to Mexico, Trump vowed to tax anything Deere tried to export back into the United States \u2014 at 200%.\n\nThis time, he\u2019s gone much further: He has proposed a 60% tariff on goods from China \u2014 and a tariff of up to 20% on everything else the United States imports.\n\nAs president, Trump imposed tariffs with a flourish \u2014 targeting imported solar panels, steel, aluminum and pretty much everything from China.\n\n\u201cTariffs are the greatest thing ever invented,\u2019\u2019 Trump said this month in Flint, Michigan.\n\nThe former president and current Republican nominee asserts that tariffs \u2014 basically import taxes \u2014 will create more factory jobs, shrink the federal deficit, lower food prices and allow the government to subsidize childcare.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Donald Trump has identified what he sees as an all-purpose fix for what ails America: Slap huge new tariffs on foreign goods entering the United States.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has dismissed Trump\u2019s tariff threats as unserious. Her campaign has cited a report that found that Trump\u2019s 20% universal tariff would cost a typical family nearly $4,000 a year.\n\nBut the Biden-Harris administration itself has a taste for tariffs. It retained the taxes Trump imposed on $360 billion in Chinese goods. And it imposed a 100% tariff on Chinese electric vehicles.\n\nIndeed, the United States in recent years has gradually retreated from its post-World War II role of promoting global free trade and lower tariffs. That shift has been a response to the loss of U.S. manufacturing jobs, widely attributed to unfettered tree trade and an increasingly aggressive China.\n\nTariffs are a tax on imports\n\nThey are typically charged as a percentage of the price a buyer pays a foreign seller. In the United States, tariffs are collected by Customs and Border Protection agents at 328 ports of entry across the country.\n\nThe tariff rates range from passenger cars (2.5%) to golf shoes (6%). Tariffs can be lower for countries with which the United States has trade agreements. For example, most goods can move among the United States, Mexico and Canada tariff-free because of Trump\u2019s US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement.\n\nThere\u2019s much misinformation about who actually pays tariffs\n\nTrump insists that tariffs are paid for by foreign countries. In fact, its is importers \u2014 American companies \u2014 that pay tariffs, and the money goes to U.S. Treasury. Those companies, in turn, typically pass their higher costs on to their customers in the form of higher prices. That\u2019s why economists say consumers usually end up footing the bill for tariffs.\n\nStill, tariffs can hurt foreign countries by making their products pricier and harder to sell abroad. Yang Zhou, an economist at Shanghai\u2019s Fudan University, concluded in a study that Trump\u2019s tariffs on Chinese goods inflicted more than three times as much damage to the Chinese economy as they did to the U.S. economy\n\nTariffs are intended mainly to protect domestic industries\n\nBy raising the price of imports, tariffs can protect home-grown manufacturers. They may also serve to punish foreign countries for committing unfair trade practices, like subsidizing their exporters or dumping products at unfairly low prices.\n\nBefore the federal income tax was established in 1913, tariffs were a major revenue driver for the government. From 1790 to 1860, tariffs accounted for 90% of federal revenue, according to Douglas Irwin, a Dartmouth College economist who has studied the history of trade policy.\n\nTariffs fell out of favor as global trade grew after World War II. The government needed vastly bigger revenue streams to finance its operations.\n\nIn the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, the government is expected to collect $81.4 billion in tariffs and fees. That\u2019s a trifle next to the $2.5 trillion that\u2019s expected to come from individual income taxes and the $1.7 trillion from Social Security and Medicare taxes.\n\nStill, Trump wants to enact a budget policy that resembles what was in place in the 19th century.\n\nHe has argued that tariffs on farm imports could lower food prices by aiding America\u2019s farmers. In fact, tariffs on imported food products would almost certainly send grocery prices up by reducing choices for consumers and competition for American producers.\n\nTariffs can also be used to pressure other countries on issues that may or may not be related to trade. In 2019, for example, Trump used the threat of tariffs as leverage to persuade Mexico to crack down on waves of Central American migrants crossing Mexican territory on their way to the United States.\n\nTrump even sees tariffs as a way to prevent wars.\n\n\u201cI can do it with a phone call,\u2019\u2019 he said at an August rally in North Carolina.\n\nIf another country tries to start a war, he said he\u2019d issue a threat:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to charge you 100% tariffs. And all of a sudden, the president or prime minister or dictator or whoever the hell is running the country says to me, \u2018Sir, we won\u2019t go to war.\u2019 \u201d\n\nEconomists generally consider tariffs self-defeating\n\nTariffs raise costs for companies and consumers that rely on imports. They\u2019re also likely to provoke retaliation.\n\nThe European Union, for example, punched back against Trump\u2019s tariffs on steel and aluminum by taxing U.S. products, from bourbon to Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Likewise, China responded to Trump\u2019s trade war by slapping tariffs on American goods, including soybeans and pork in a calculated drive to hurt his supporters in farm country.\n\nA study by economists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Zurich, Harvard and the World Bank concluded that Trump\u2019s tariffs failed to restore jobs to the American heartland. The tariffs \u201cneither raised nor lowered U.S. employment\u2019\u2019 where they were supposed to protect jobs, the study found.\n\nDespite Trump\u2019s 2018 taxes on imported steel, for example, the number of jobs at U.S. steel plants barely budged: They remained right around 140,000. By comparison, Walmart alone employs 1.6 million people in the United States.\n\nWorse, the retaliatory taxes imposed by China and other nations on U.S. goods had \u201cnegative employment impacts,\u2019\u2019 especially for farmers, the study found. These retaliatory tariffs were only partly offset by billions in government aid that Trump doled out to farmers. The Trump tariffs also damaged companies that relied on targeted imports.\n\nIf Trump\u2019s trade war fizzled as policy, though, it succeeded as politics. The study found that support for Trump and Republican congressional candidates rose in areas most exposed to the import tariffs \u2014 the industrial Midwest and manufacturing-heavy Southern states like North Carolina and Tennessee.",

But elsewhere there\u2019s pushback to the idea. Amendments to bar noncitizen voting are on the ballot this fall in eight states: Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Wisconsin.\n\nOnly citizens are allowed to vote in federal elections, however, according to U.S. law. On the federal voter registration form, which is accepted by all states except New Hampshire and Wisconsin, prospective voters must check a box affirming under penalty of perjury that they are a United States citizen. The form does not require accompanying proof of citizenship, but warns applicants that anyone who provides false information may be fined, imprisoned, or \u2013 if a noncitizen \u2013 deported.\n\nMany voters demonstrate citizenship status when obtaining certain forms of identification, but state rules vary. Among those with stricter rules:\n\nNew Hampshire: Requires proof of citizenship to register and vote. Currently, if a voter does not have such proof, they can sign an affidavit, under oath, before an election official.\n\nArizona: Requires proof of citizenship to register via the state\u2019s registration form. However, after numerous legal challenges to the 2022 law requiring proof of citizenship, applicants using the federal form can vote in federal elections (but not state and local elections) without such proof.\n\nTexas: Requires state court clerks to notify the secretary of state of those excused or disqualified from jury duty for not being a U.S. citizen. If those people don\u2019t provide proof of citizenship within 30 days of being notified, their voter registration can be canceled.\n\nGeorgia: May cross-check voters\u2019 Social Security numbers against state databases.\n\nHow much evidence is there that noncitizens register and vote?\n\nThere are very few proven instances of noncitizens registering to vote, and even fewer of them actually voting. Instances of unauthorized immigrants voting are \u201cso rare as to be statistically nonexistent,\u201d says Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, senior fellow at the American Immigration Council.\n\nA 2016 study by the Brennan Center for Justice, which involved interviewing local election officials in 42 jurisdictions \u2013 including eight of the 10 with the largest noncitizen populations \u2013 found that only an estimated 30 incidents of suspected noncitizen voting among 23.5 million votes cast were referred for further investigation or prosecution. However, the interviews relied on officials\u2019 estimates rather than on hard records, and did not ask how officials evaluated eligibility or determined whether to refer cases to prosecution.\n\nEven the conservative Heritage Foundation, which maintains an extensive database of documented voter fraud, has identified just several dozen prosecutions of noncitizens registering to vote or actually voting over the past 20 years. Hans von Spakovsky, who heads the think tank\u2019s Election Law Reform Initiative, says that\u2019s because of both the lack of mechanisms to verify citizenship and the lack of prosecutions.\n\nJonathan Drake/Reuters A precinct official performs logic and accuracy testing on voting machines ahead of the general election, at Wake County Board of Elections headquarters in Raleigh, North Carolina, Sept. 5, 2024.\n\nHe cites, for example, a GOP-led U.S. House Oversight investigation into a California race 20 years ago that flagged 624 voters as noncitizens based on an Immigration and Naturalization Service database. However, in the report, the Democratic minority wrote that the results were flawed, citing letters from INS warning that the committee\u2019s method of searching the database could result in false matches and flagging of citizens that had since been naturalized.\n\nUltimately, the California secretary of state did not prosecute any of the cases, determining that each registered in error, not with intent to register illegally.\n\nBut efforts by a handful of GOP secretaries of state have not turned up evidence of widespread noncitizen voting. They have flagged thousands of potential noncitizens who tried \u2013 and in some cases, succeeded \u2013 to register as voters, though only a fraction actually voted. The states, in announcing their findings below, did not disclose how they verified lack of citizenship. One option is cross-checking registered voters with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services\u2019 Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) database, which verifies immigration status.\n\nAlabama: The state since 2023 has identified 3,251 noncitizens registered to vote, though it said it\u2019s possible that some are now naturalized and eligible to vote.\n\nGeorgia: A 2022 review in the state, which has a process for checking citizenship, found that election officials had flagged and prevented about 1,600 registration applications by potential noncitizens over the past 25 years.\n\nOhio: This year, Ohio identified 138 noncitizens \u201cwho appear to have cast a ballot\u201d by cross-referencing state and federal databases, including jury pool data.\n\nVirginia: Gov. Glenn Youngkin removed 6,303 noncitizens from the state\u2019s voter rolls over the past two years, based on data collected by the Department of Motor Vehicles and shared with the state Department of Elections.\n\nIn each of these states, votes cast by noncitizens account for a significantly smaller share of overall fraud than other categories, such as deceased voters, voters who have moved out of state, or voters who still have a driver\u2019s license from another state. In Texas, for example, of more than 1 million people removed from voter rolls since 2021, only 6,500 were potential noncitizens, and of those only 1,900 had voted.\n\nMany opponents of stricter proof-of-citizenship standards say noncitizens already have a huge disincentive to vote, risking their status in the country or their ability to naturalize. However, some instances are unintentional, and often the penalties are minimal. For example, in the nearly four dozen cases Heritage documented, only one noncitizen was referred to Immigration and Customs Enforcement for deportation. Many did not serve any jail time, and apart from two men who faced a raft of other charges, the highest fine any paid was $2,500.\n\nWhat are the counter-concerns about voting rights?\n\nSome Democrats have warned that measures like additional updates for voter rolls or requirements for proof of citizenship could result in voter suppression. Proof-of-citizenship requirements act as an unnecessary hurdle for eligible voters, they say, often pointing to surveys that show that about 1 in 10 Americans don\u2019t have ready access to documents like birth certificates and passports. The Biden administration echoed those concerns in a July statement, adding that an additional risk is accidentally purging eligible voters from voter rolls.\n\nCritics of proof-of-citizenship requirements point to Kansas and Arizona as case studies showing that the number of eligible voters removed from the rolls can far exceed the number of ineligible voters identified.\n\nIn Kansas in 2020, a federal appeals court overruled the state\u2019s 2011 law requiring documentary proof of citizenship to apply to register to vote. The court\u2019s decision cited 31,089 voters whose applications were canceled or suspended in the state, and only found evidence that 67 noncitizens attempted to register and that 39 succeeded between 1999 and 2013, when the law took effect.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This story, originally published on Sept. 10, was updated to note concerns that a U.S. House Oversight investigation used flawed methodology to determine how many noncitizens had voted in a California congressional race, and to correct the spelling of Mr. Reichlin-Melnick\u2019s name.",

        "text": "WATCH: Vance and Walz debate \u2014 PBS News simulcast of CBS\u2019s 2024 Vice Presidential Debate\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Sen. JD Vance of Ohio are meeting Tuesday for their first and only scheduled vice presidential debate.\n\nThe 90-minute CBS 2024 Vice Presidential Debate will air at 9 p.m. EDT on Tuesday, Oct. 1. PBS News coverage starts with the News Hour at 6 p.m. EDT, then stay tuned for special analysis following the debate. You can watch live in our player above.\n\nREAD MORE: What to expect from the Vance-Walz vice presidential debate\n\nWalz, who is Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 running mate, and Vance, who is on the Republican ticket with former President Donald Trump, will make the case for their respective candidates five weeks before Election Day. They have been crisscrossing the country to introduce themselves to voters, paying special attention to the handful of battleground states that will determine the winner.\n\nWho is hosting?\n\nIt\u2019s being moderated by \u201cCBS Evening News\u201d anchor Norah O\u2019Donnell and Margaret Brennan of CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d CBS News is airing the debate on its broadcast network live and will livestream it on all platforms where CBS News 24/7 and Paramount+ are available. It\u2019s also being made available for simulcast, and networks like PBS will air it.\n\nWhere is the debate?\n\nThe vice-presidential debate is taking place in New York City.\n\nOften the scene of fundraising events for candidates in both parties, New York has been considered a reliably Democratic state in the general election. But Trump, a native New Yorker, has insisted he has a chance to put it in the Republican column this year, despite losing the state in his two earlier bids for the presidency, and has held events in the South Bronx and on Long Island.\n\nREAD MORE: Who is JD Vance? What to know about Trump\u2019s pick for vice president\n\nHarris, meanwhile, has announced she\u2019s skipping this year\u2019s Al Smith dinner, a Catholic Charities benefit event held in New York City that is typically used to promote collegiality and good humor. Rather than attend the Oct. 17 gala \u2014 at which Trump will now be the sole featured speaker \u2014 Harris\u2019 campaign said she would stump in a battleground state instead.\n\nHow are the candidates preparing?\n\nWalz and Vance will meet for the first time in person on the biggest stage of their political careers. Both have been engaged in preparations for the debate with stand-ins used for their opponents.\n\nTransportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg has been playing the role of Vance in the Walz debate prep, which has been taking place at a downtown Minneapolis hotel, according to a person familiar with the preparations. The person said Buttigieg was chosen because he\u2019s a sharp communicator, and the campaign believes that Vance will be a formidable opponent.\n\nOn the Republican side, a person familiar with Vance\u2019s preparations said GOP Rep. Tom Emmer \u2014 who, like Walz, hails from Minnesota \u2014 will be standing in for the Democrat in a similar fashion. The people speaking about both candidates\u2019 plans spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door preparations.\n\nCBS is expected to release more information about the debate rules in the coming days.\n\nWill there be another presidential or vice presidential debate?\n\nNo additional presidential or vice presidential debates are scheduled, but that could always change.\n\nAfter Harris and Trump\u2019s presidential debate on Sept. 10, Harris said she\u2019d be open to debating the former president again.

        "text": "\u2013 U.S. Presidential Election: Why These Elections Are Crucial for Abortion Rights Worldwide\nThis month, RFSU, Equipop\u2019s partner in Sweden, published a report warning about \u201cProject 2025,\u201d an ultraconservative plan aiming to harden anti-gender laws and undermine sexual and reproductive rights. Developed under the influence of the powerful ultraconservative think tank \u201cHeritage Foundation\u201d and supported by more than 80 associations and organizations, including Catholic and Evangelical groups, \u201cProject 2025\u201d is presented as a roadmap for the next administration in 2025.\n\nDespite Trump\u2019s public denials of his involvement in \u201cProject 2025,\u201d a CNN investigation reveals that at least 140 former members of his administration contributed to it. This project outlines a series of policy recommendations that go beyond restricting abortion, including plans to limit access to contraception. If implemented, this project will have a significant impact on maternal health and gender equality more broadly. The plan is based on an extreme interpretation of the U.S. Constitution, known as the \u201cunitary executive theory,\u201d which concentrates executive power in the hands of the president. Having participated in several intergovernmental processes, such as the UN\u2019s Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) or the G7, Equipop has witnessed Trump\u2019s administration\u2019s attempts to sabotage negotiations, even questioning basic terms like \u201cgender.\u201d Alongside its partners, Equipop has been mobilizing for years against this backlash.\n\nBeyond the figurehead of Donald Trump, anti-rights movements are taking shape across all continents. Other leaders, such as Javier Milei in Argentina, who plans to repeal the law guaranteeing the right to abortion, or Viktor Orb\u00e1n, who hardened legislation in 2022 by forcing women to listen to the fetus\u2019s heartbeat before an abortion, share this anti-choice and regressive agenda. In C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, homophobic rhetoric is on the rise, while in Senegal, the total ban on abortion, influenced by anti-choice movements, remains in place. In France, too, far-right ideas are dangerously gaining ground, as evidenced by the rise of the Rassemblement National (RN) and the increasingly conservative rhetoric of Les R\u00e9publicains (LR), particularly on abortion and LGBTQIA+ rights. During the debates on enshrining the right to abortion in the constitution, some LR members proposed an amendment invoking \u201cthe protection of unborn life.\u201d\n\nIf implemented, \u201cProject 2025\u201d will trigger international shockwaves. Its authors aim to reshape U.S. diplomacy by promoting anti-choice and anti-LGBTQIA+ programs within international bodies like the UN. They seek to redefine human rights, distorting norms established by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international conventions. Additionally, they advocate for U.S. withdrawal from international organizations and traditional diplomatic alliances. With the rise of the far right in Europe, there is a risk that this project could serve as a template for far-right groups both within the European Parliament and within countries themselves. Finally, this project would lead the United States, currently the largest donor of official development assistance, to drastically cut funding for gender equality and access to health care. For instance, according to the RFSU report, the US continues to be the largest donor to HIV programs at $6.1 billion, providing 74% of all donor government HIV funding.\n\nFinally, the RFSU report reminds us that even if Kamala Harris wins in November, \u201cProject 2025\u201d will continue to exist and influence public policy. The Geneva Consensus Declaration, which contests abortion and was inspired by this project, still shapes the diplomacy of many states, despite the departure of the Trump administration. Today, organizations linked to \u201cProject 2025,\u201d such as the Institute of Women\u2019s Health (IWH), continue to promote it and rally new signatories, with the support of the Hungarian government.",

        "text": "The storm clouds may be parting after Zelenskyy\u2019s tumultuous US visit\nIt has been quite a week for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He arrived in New York on Sunday to address the United Nations General Assembly and meet with world leaders. But his real agenda was to meet with US President Joe Biden and presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. From Biden, he wanted permission to use US Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS)\u2014accurate missiles with a range of three hundred kilometers\u2014on military targets in Russia. With Trump and Harris, Zelenskyy wanted to renew and strengthen his relationship before the US presidential election that will make one of them president in four months.\n\nZelenskyy\u2019s interactions with Biden and Harris were predictable. It was no surprise that the Ukrainian president did not persuade his US counterpart to permit the use of ATACMs in Russia. Since the start of Moscow\u2019s full-scale invasion, Russian President Vladimir Putin has managed to get into Biden\u2019s head with nuclear bluster. Putin\u2019s decision this week to \u201crevise\u201d Russian doctrine to establish a lower threshold for using nuclear weapons gave Biden one more reason to put off making a sensible and necessary decision to aid Ukraine\u2019s war effort. Aside from that expected point of divergence, the meeting of the two presidents was amicable, with Biden stating his support for a Ukrainian win in the war and the administration announcing a new tranche of weapons (worth nearly eight billion dollars) heading to Ukraine, including for the first time Joint Standoff Weapons\u2014an air-launched glide bomb with a range of seventy miles. The Harris meeting was also low drama. There was a warm exchange, with Harris saying afterwards that she strongly supported Ukraine and that her position on Russia\u2019s aggression contrasted with Trump\u2019s.\n\nAll the drama in Zelenskyy\u2019s trip centered on his relationship with Trump. Of course, the connection between the two has not been easy since the controversial phone call in July 2019 that featured in the first impeachment process against Trump. But the relationship at least partly normalized earlier this year when Trump enabled Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson to put to a vote in April the supplemental aid package that a small group of populist Republicans had blocked for seven months. This was followed by a friendly phone call between the two this summer.\n\nZelenskyy did two things on Sunday that turned his trip upside down.\n\nComing to the United States, Zelenskyy was well aware that there are contending factions within the Republican Party and the Trump team on aid to Ukraine. One side recognizes that Russia treats the United States as its principal adversary and seeks to undermine NATO. Therefore, the United States has vital interests in helping Ukraine defeat Putin\u2019s aggression. The other side ignores the danger for the United States posed by Russian policies and fails to see the importance of aiding Ukraine. Even though the second group includes Trump\u2019s vice-presidential pick and oldest son, Trump has not committed to either view.\n\nZelenskyy did two things on Sunday that turned his trip upside down, although that did not become evident for a couple of days. First, he visited a US Army ammunition plant in Scranton, Pennsylvania, to thank the workers there for making rounds for Ukraine\u2019s defense and to oversee the signing of an agreement between Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and his Zaporizhzhia counterpart on regional cooperation; Zelenskyy had done the same on a trip to Utah\u2014where he was hosted by the state\u2019s Republican governor\u2014earlier in the year. Second he did an interview with the New Yorker in which he referred to Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance\u2019s \u201cradical\u201d views on Ukraine.\n\nBy Tuesday, these two developments had created a firestorm in Republican circles. Many Republicans called the trip to Scranton a political rally to help the Democrats in the swing state of Pennsylvania. While the anti-Ukraine faction in the Republican Party jumped on this as a way to influence Trump\u2019s views on Ukraine, many stalwart supporters of Ukraine also slammed the trip. Many also called out Zelenskyy for his criticism of Vance. (While Zelenskyy\u2019s characterization of Vance\u2019s position on Ukraine was milder than some Republicans, such as Senator Thom Tillis, he had no need to comment.) As part of this furor, Johnson called on Zelenskyy to fire Ukraine\u2019s ambassador to the United States, Oksana Markarova. Perhaps even more unsettling, Trump himself began to criticize Zelenskyy and Ukraine for not ceding some territory in a bid to end the war with Putin; and the Trump team refused to confirm a meeting with Zelenskyy.\n\nThis drama lasted a bit more than two full days. By Thursday evening, perhaps not coincidentally just hours after Zelenskyy\u2019s meetings with Biden and Harris, the news broke that Trump would see the Ukrainian president in New York on Friday. They met, jointly spoke with the press, and described a cordial exchange. And from Thursday evening, all Republican criticism of Zelenskyy and Ukraine ceased. When questioned by the media, Trump refused to say that Ukraine should give up territory to make peace. When Johnson appeared on Fox News on Friday, he expressed displeasure about Zelenskyy\u2019s Scranton trip but refused to back off his support for the April spending bill and did not rule out further aid for Ukraine next year\u2014though he was quick to add that he expects Trump to be in the White House \u201cto direct how all that is handled.\u201d\n\nWe cannot be sure what happened, but the answer may lie in the fact that a majority of Americans are in favor of maintaining or increasing aid to Ukraine. In addition, Pennsylvania is perhaps the most important swing state in the November election, with more than 800,000 Ukrainian- and Polish-Americans who are more likely than most to understand that Putin is threatening Ukrainian extinction and considers the United States an enemy. Whatever the explanation for this turn of events, it is bad news for the naifs on the political right who see no problem in abandoning Ukraine to Putin\u2019s tender mercies. And that is good for the United States.\n\nJohn E. Herbst is senior director of the Atlantic Council\u2019s Eurasia Center and served for thirty-one years as a foreign service officer in the US Department of State, retiring at the rank of career minister. He was US ambassador to Ukraine from 2003 to 2006.\n\nFurther reading\n\nImage: Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Ukraine's president, during a meeting with USA Vice President Kamala Harris, not pictured, in the Vice President's Ceremonial Office in Washington, DC, USA, on Thursday, September 26, 2024.

(September 27, 2024)\nReturn your voted ballot now!\n\n\n\nRemember U.S. embassies and consulates are not polling places. Same-day, in-person voting is not available outside the United States. Many states require voted ballots to reach local election officials by the time polls close on election day (Tuesday, November 5). U.S. citizens who want to participate in the 2024 U.S. elections from overseas should have already returned their absentee ballots to their local election officials.\n\nNever received your ballot?\n\n\n\nIf you registered to vote and requested an absentee ballot prior to your state\u2019s registration deadline, but have not yet received your ballot, you can complete and return a Federal Write-in Absentee Ballot (FWAB) and return it to your local election office. The FWAB is available at www.FVAP.gov. If your regular ballot arrives later, complete and return it as well. Your FWAB will only be counted if your regular ballot does not reach local election officials by your state\u2019s deadline. Your vote will not be counted twice.\n\nRETURNING YOUR BALLOT:\n\nIf you plan to drop your ballot off at the U.S. Embassy in Panama City, to be returned to your local election office, we recommend you do so no later than October 4, during normal business hours . Please ensure your ballot is addressed to your local election officials and is either placed a postage-paid envelope or bears sufficient domestic U.S. postage.\n\nU.S. Embassy Panama specific drop-off instructions: Upon arrival to the Embassy\u2019s front gate, notify Embassy guards that you are dropping off your absentee ballot. Guards will then escort or direct you to our ballot mailbox, located just inside the front gate.\n\nIf it is more convenient, you can have a friend or family member drop off your voting forms or ballots at the Embassy on your behalf. Please ensure that this is done during normal business hours.\n\nMissed the U.S. Embassy in Panama City shipment deadline?\n\nIf your state allows, you may be able to return your voted ballot to your local election office electronically. You can also consider returning your ballot via an express courier service at your own expense. Ballots sent via express courier do not receive standard postmarks, so voters using this method should confirm delivery on or before November 5 prior to payment and shipment. Check your state\u2019s voting procedures at www.FVAP.gov for guidance.\n\nIf you have previously registered to vote and requested an absentee ballot but it has not yet arrived, some states allow voters to email or fax their voted, signed Federal Write-in Absentee Ballots to local election officials. Review your state\u2019s voting procedures at www.FVAP.gov carefully for guidance.\n\nHELP SPREAD THE WORD ABOUT OVERSEAS VOTING.\n\nPlease help spread the word to your friends, family, and colleagues that now is the time return your ballot if you are voting from overseas.\n\nHave Questions?\n\nPlease contact the American Citizen Services unit at Panama-ACS@state.gov. You can also contact the Federal Voting Assistance Program directly at Vote@FVAP.gov. Confirm your registration and ballot delivery online.

        "text": "Standards Editor: What\u2019s different about covering the 2024 U.S. presidential election? Just about everything\nWith concerns about misinformation and vote-tampering swirling around the coming U.S. presidential election, credible, ethical news organizations play an essential role in keeping the voters informed. But although 58 per cent of Americans polled by the Pew Research Center said they were following news about the candidates \u201cvery closely\u201d or \u201cfairly closely\u201d in May, 62 per cent had already reported feeling \u201cworn out\u201d by the large volume of coverage.\n\nNews media are gearing up for a reporting marathon that many predict will carry on for days after the polls close on Nov. 5, as some results are contested and verified. But what are news organizations doing to ensure their reporting is accurate? What are they doing to encourage readers\u2019 trust? And how is today\u2019s coverage different from that of previous elections?\n\nGlobe and Mail contributing writer David Shribman has been covering U.S. presidential elections since he was a teenager, working for a local paper in his hometown. As an adult, he reported on them for major American newspapers and won a Pulitzer Prize in 1995 for his coverage of U.S. politics. He says technology represents the biggest change in election reporting.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s an anecdote that explains it all,\u201d David wrote to me in an e-mail. \u201cThe big story in the spring of 1987 was the withdrawal of the front-runner for the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination, Senator Gary Hart of Colorado, amid reports that he had an affair. The denouement occurred on the campus of Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, where, a dozen years earlier, I had been an undergraduate. Mr. Hart had a disastrous press conference and, in the only occasion in which I was way, way, way ahead of my colleagues, I got to report the news to my office first. I knew the location of the only pay phone in the building.\u201d\n\nThe advent of mobile phones and internet made it possible to file stories almost instantly. \u201cIn that 1988 campaign I often had a day, maybe two, to craft my pieces. Now when I write an analysis for The Globe, it is a matter of hours if not minutes.\u201d\n\nThis demand for immediacy is at odds with the time-consuming need to fact-check. The Globe\u2019s foreign editor, Angela Murphy, who oversees the coverage of U.S. and international issues, calls the rise of misinformation \u201cprobably the biggest thing that\u2019s changed\u201d for journalists covering the election. In their duty to readers, it is not enough for journalists to \u201cknow\u201d that a politician\u2019s statement is incorrect; they must research and report evidence that proves the statement is incorrect \u2013 a labour-intensive task.\n\nEarlier this month, Angela moderated a Canadian Journalism Foundation panel discussion that focused on this very subject. She asked the panel: Can journalists report on misinformation without amplifying it?\n\n\u201cNot discussing it is not the option,\u201d answered MSNBC chief correspondent Ali Velshi. \u201cRepeating the lie and then putting it out there to get solved is not the option, hoping that the crowd will solve it.\u201d Journalists must report on misinformation, he said, and explain the \u201clong homework\u201d they conducted to confirm it as false.\n\nThis added labour has become a resourcing problem for many newsrooms, Angela told me, noting that some larger news organizations have entire teams whose job is to tackle misinformation; U.S.-based CBS News, for example, has devoted \u201cabout 20 journalists\u201d to this task, according to The New York Times.\n\nABC News staffed its real-time broadcast of the Sept. 10 debate between Republican candidate Donald Trump and Democratic candidate Kamala Harris with live fact-checkers, but was quickly criticized \u2013 especially by conservatives \u2013 for focusing on Mr. Trump\u2019s errors during the broadcast.\n\n\u201cI think the Trump camp has a point here,\u201d said David, whose analysis of the debate was published that same evening. \u201cHis reputation for having a casual relationship with the facts hurt him that night; the moderators were on the lookout for tall stories, and worse. He delivered, as they knew he would. But Ms. Harris had a few bloopers too. They didn\u2019t call her on them.\u201d (An online article posted the next day offered ABC News\u2019 fact-checks of both candidates.)\n\nIn the same vein, Angela says, \u201cJust because Trump is doing what he does doesn\u2019t mean we give the Harris side a pass. They deserve to be scrutinized.\u201d\n\nSo, journalists agree that fact-checking is essential. But do readers notice these efforts, or even care?\n\nEarlier this year, a poll conducted by the American Press Institute and the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that 53 per cent of respondents were \u201cextremely or very concerned that news organizations will report inaccuracies or misinformation during the election,\u201d according to a report from the Associated Press wire service. Further, the report said, \u201cThe poll found 47 per cent of Americans also expressing serious concern that news outlets would report information that has not been confirmed or verified, and 44 per cent worry that accurate information will be presented in a way that favours one side or another.\u201d\n\nFor the elusive 18-to-25 demographic, herculean fact-checking efforts may not matter at all if election coverage is presented in a traditional news-media format, said Jeremy Gilbert, a professor of digital media strategy at Medill\u2013Northwestern University who oversees the university\u2019s Knight Lab. From interviews with 45 young news consumers, the lab found that many responded to traditional news reporting \u2013 written articles in print or online, for example, \u201cwith some discomfort,\u201d Prof. Gilbert said. \u201cIt\u2019s not that there\u2019s anything particularly wrong with AP Style, but it\u2019s not the way they talk. It\u2019s not the way they write. And it\u2019s not a comfortable way for them to read or listen.\u201d\n\nMost of the interviewees had learned media literacy in school, yet journalistic institutions that followed ethical practices and were transparent with their audiences were not the sources they favoured. \u201cJust because they were thoughtful about what information to consume didn\u2019t mean that authoritative-sounding information was preferred. They were looking for other cues about what to trust,\u201d Prof. Gilbert said. \u201cAnd so, sounding like someone they knew or know was a much stronger signal than sounding like \u2013 I always joke about it, but Walter Cronkite. They were looking for an authoritative friend.\u201d\n\nThe interviewees were very aware that most news organizations are for-profit businesses, he said. \u201cThat in and of itself made them a little skeptical: \u2018Why are you telling me this particular piece of information? Is it because you want to get me to subscribe or you want to get me to view advertising? Are you funded by large companies, or \u2026 ?\u201d\n\nYoung news consumers are more likely to seek information from podcasts, direct messaging groups and private social-media channels. \u201cThey\u2019re much less likely to trust things that are being said to large groups because the assumption is that\u2019s impersonal and therefore not for them.\u201d",

        "text": "US moves against Iranian actors charged with election meddling\nThe United States put bounties on three Iranian hackers, charging them with multiple crimes in connection with an attempt to undermine former President Donald Trump's reelection campaign and upend the upcoming U.S. presidential election.\n\nFriday's actions by multiple U.S. government agencies came with just a little over a month until U.S. voters go to the polls and as U.S. officials seek to push back against what they describe as ever more brazen attempts by Iran to foment division and discord in Washington and beyond.\n\n\"You and your hackers can't hide behind your keyboards,\" said FBI Director Christopher Wray in a video statement.\n\n\"If you try to meddle in our elections, we're going to hold you accountable,\" Wray said. \"As long as you keep attempting to flout the rule of law, you're going to keep running into the FBI.\"\n\nIranian officials have previously and repeatedly rejected U.S. accusations of election meddling. The Iranian Mission to the United Nations has not yet responded to VOA's request for comment on the latest allegations.\n\nBut an indictment unsealed by the U.S. Justice Department assigns responsibility for Iran's long-standing efforts, as well as a recent hack-and-leak operation aimed at derailing the Trump campaign, to three hackers employed by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or IRGC.\n\nIt accuses Masoud Jalili, Seyyed Ali Aghamiri and Yaser Balaghi of engaging in what prosecutors describe as a wide-ranging campaign to hack into the work and personal email accounts of current and former government officials, campaign officials and members of the media.\n\nProsecutors said their list of victims includes a former State Department official, a former presidential homeland security adviser and at least two former CIA officials.\n\nBut starting in May, prosecutors allege, the three Iranians turned their attention to the Trump campaign, stealing documents and materials that they then sought to leak to the public.\n\n\"I think this information is worth a good [U.S. news publication] piece with your narration,\" they wrote in an email to a U.S. news outlet in late July or early August, according to the indictment. \"Let me know your thoughts.\"\n\nThe revelations build on a U.S. intelligence assessment shared last week, which alleged Iranian actors tried to ensnare officials with the reelection campaign of U.S. President Joe Biden, before Biden's decision to drop out of the race.\n\nThe Trump campaign first announced the suspected hack last month, initially blaming \"foreign sources hostile to the United States.\" U.S. intelligence officials attributed the attack to Iran about a week later.\n\n\"The defendants' own words make clear that they were attempting to undermine former President Trump's campaign in advance of the 2024 U.S. presidential election,\" said U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland during a news conference to announce the charges Friday.\n\nAll three are believed to remain in Iran, although the U.S. is offering a reward of up to $10 million for information that leads to their arrests. And both the State Department and the FBI have issued wanted posters of the suspects.\n\n\"We will follow these people for the rest of their lives,\" Garland said.\n\nThe indictment also makes clear that the efforts spearheaded by the Iranian hackers have not necessarily abated, noting there have been efforts to potentially steal more information as well as to leak already stolen materials to media outlets.\n\n\"When it comes to advanced persistent threat actors, you can never be fully confident that you have eradicated them from an environment,\" a senior FBI official told reporters Friday, briefing on the condition of anonymity. \"So, we remain fully engaged with the victims in this case, which include presidential campaigns, as well as individuals associated with those campaigns, to breed resilience among their systems and their various email accounts.\"\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies have previously said that Tehran is working to hurt the campaign of Trump, believing his election would be detrimental to Iran's goals in the Middle East and beyond.\n\nSenior officials said the latest indictment shows Iranian officials remain intent on damaging the Trump campaign.\n\n\"Iran perceives this year's elections to be particularly consequential in terms of the impact they could have on its national security interests,\" said the senior FBI official. \"We will be more persistent than the Iranian actors in ensuring that we are assisting victims of this activity [and] increase their resilience against these actors.\"\n\nJalili, Aghamiri and Balaghi are charged with multiple counts of conspiracy to commit identity theft, aggravated identity theft, access device fraud, unauthorized access to computers and wire fraud.\n\nThe various charges carry maximum penalties ranging from two to 27 years in prison.",

        "text": "How to Watch the Vance-Walz VP Debate\nVice-presidential candidates J.D. Vance, the Republican Ohio Senator and Tim Walz, the Democratic Governor of Minnesota, will participate in the only vice-presidential debate of the 2024 U.S. election in an event hosted by CBS News. It will be moderated by Norah O\u2019Donnell, the CBS Evening News anchor and managing editor, alongside Margaret Brennan, a chief foreign affairs correspondent at CBS News and moderator of Face The Nation.\n\nCBS News has laid out the rules for the debate. Much like the presidential debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, which took place in Philadelphia on Sept. 10, there will be no audience in the studio when the VP candidates meet. As for whether the candidates' microphones will be turned off when it is not their turn to speak, the network said: \"CBS News reserves the right to mute the candidates' microphones, but otherwise, they will be hot.\"\n\nThis is the first election cycle since 1988 for which the Nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates is not involved in arranging presidential and vice presidential debates. In 2022, the Republican National Committee voted unanimously to withdraw from the Commission on Presidential Debates, largely due to concerns of perceived bias against Republican candidates, such as former President Donald Trump. During the 2024 election, news organizations have been negotiating directly with presidential campaigns in order to schedule debates and establish rules.\n\nWhen is the VP debate?\n\nThe debate will take place on Tuesday, Oct. 1. It is set to begin at 9 p.m. EST and is expected to last 90 minutes.\n\nWhere is the VP debate?\n\nThe debate will take place in New York City at the CBS Broadcast Center. The event comes as the city is reeling from a major political scandal after Democratic Mayor Eric Adams was indicted on charges of bribery and fraud.\n\nHow can I watch the VP debate?\n\nViewers in the U.S. can watch the debate in full on the CBS News television network in their locality. They can also stream it online via CBS News 24/7 and Paramount+. The debate is being simulcast, so other platforms such as PBS News, C-Span, and Fox News will also broadcast the event.",

        "text": "Nate Silver has good news for Kamala Harris? Here's what he says about her key edge in his latest poll predictions\n\u2014 NateSilver538 (@NateSilver538)\n\n\n\n\n\n(You can now subscribe to our\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel\n\nPollster Nate Silver 's latest election forecast indicates that national polls now favor Kamala Harris , with the vice president leading former President Donald Trump by three percentage points. The figures are 49.1 percent for Harris compared to Trump's 46.1 percent.In his update, Silver mentioned, \u201cA lot of polling since our last update, and the model mostly liked it for Harris \u2014 especially the national polls, which show her lead expanding to an even 3 points.\u201d He added, \u201cForecast still in toss-up range, but we\u2019re at a point where you\u2019d probably rather have Harris\u2019s hand to play.\"Silver\u2019s model suggests that Harris's path to victory would likely involve securing states like Pennsylvania, Michigan , and Wisconsin. Arizona is considered less critical, while North Carolina and Georgia could also play significant roles.Despite his interest in elections, Silver states he generally avoids politics. On a podcast, he expressed support for Harris but added a condition that might sway his vote. \u201cIf Kamala Harris were to say I want to ban poker, I would feel targeted as a poker player, and clearly this is a community that wouldn't be interested in the votes of people like me, so why would I want to be in their coalition?\u201d Silver remarked.He also commented, \"I don't think it's a bad thing if people vote in terms of their narrow self-interest. That's a part of a political economy that can be healthy,\" noting that Democrats might lose votes because \"they are annoying.\"Polls have favored Democratic nominee Harris, with the exception of Arizona, where a recent USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll showed the ex-president leading by 6 points. However, analyst Silver suggested that the Arizona results may not significantly impact the overall election outcome. He mentioned that his model \"somewhat shrugs Arizona polling off since it\u2019s relatively unlikely to be the tipping-point state.\"Additionally, Silver noted on social platform X that updates to economic data have improved the economic outlook, which could benefit Harris. Last week, Harris regained the lead in Silver's election forecast for the first time since late August.According to a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult survey, Harris has a narrow lead in six swing states and is tied with Trump in Georgia. She also holds a 4.1 point advantage over the former president in The Hill/Decision Desk HQ's aggregate poll.\u201cNeedless to say, stranger things have happened than a candidate who was behind in the polls winning,\u201d Silver wrote. \u201cAnd in America\u2019s polarized political climate, most elections are close and a candidate is rarely out of the running.\u201d",

        "text": "Latest Meredith Poll Illustrates N.C.\u2019s 2024 Battleground Status\nThe most recent Meredith Poll underscores North Carolina\u2019s status as a battleground state, showing candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump tied at 48 percent apiece.\n\nThe poll also examined voter preferences in the N.C. governor\u2019s race, favorability of presidential and vice presidential candidates, and the potential impact of several policy issues.\n\nPresidential Race\n\n\u201cKamala Harris\u2019 candidacy has returned the presidential campaign to essentially where it was in 2020 \u2013 an election that will be one of the tightest in the country\u2019s history,\u201d said Meredith College Poll Director David McLennan. \u201cA Trump victory in the Electoral College hinges on his winning North Carolina. The Trump campaign will continue to pour resources into the state. If Harris can squeak by and win North Carolina, her chances of winning the presidency are greatly enhanced.\u201d\n\nIn a poll that was in the field from September 17-20, 2024, only two percent of respondents were undecided just over six weeks until Election Day and third-party candidates received the remaining two percent of respondents\u2019 support. Although this seems negligible, in a race decided by approximately 75,000 votes (out of approximately 5.5 million votes cast) in 2020, this support could be meaningful.\n\nHarris has resurrected the \u201cBiden coalition\u201d from 2020 with strong support among Democrats, Black and young voters, and educated voters. She also is running strong in urban areas. Harris has a 12-point gender gap advantage over Trump.\n\nTrump remains strong with Republican voters, rural voters, and older voters. He has an advantage over Harris with male voters, but not to the same extent as he had over Joe Biden.\n\nThe battle over the last few weeks of the campaign will be for unaffiliated voters and in the suburbs. Although Harris has a small lead among suburban voters, a small shift could be meaningful in this tight election.\n\nRace for N.C. Governor\n\nThe Meredith Poll was in the field as the CNN story broke alleging that Republican candidate Mark Robinson made many inflammatory comments over a decade ago.\n\nThe first two days of data collection showed the electoral gap between Josh Stein and Mark Robinson at about 8 points\u201350-42. However, the group that answered the Meredith survey after the story broke had a 13-point gap (50-37). In the end, this survey indicates that Josh Stein has a double-digit lead over Robinson (50-40), but it appears that the CNN story peeled Robinson supporters away from him without adding to Stein\u2019s support. Robinson\u2019s support remains among conservative, rural, and older voters, but not from elsewhere.\n\n\u201cThe CNN story clearly had an impact on voter perceptions, but Robinson\u2019s campaign was already struggling against the Stein campaign,\u201d said David McLennan. \u201cIt is worth noting, however, that we have seen this story before in North Carolina governor\u2019s races. The Republican candidate, like Dan Forest, was running well behind Roy Cooper in September and October polls, only to lose on Election Day by 4.5 points. This shows the power of political partisanship in North Carolina.\u201d\n\nFor complete results, view the full report.\n\nMethodology\n\nThe Meredith Poll conducted a survey of North Carolina likely voters. The online sample\u2013from Qualtrics\u2013used a quota based on the 2020 General Election turnout of voters in North Carolina. After the survey was completed, we weighted the survey for gender, party affiliation, geographic location, race and ethnicity, and education so that our sample most closely resembles North Carolina. The sample had 802 respondents, giving us a confidence interval of +/- 3.5%. The survey was conducted in the field from September 17-20, 2024.\n\nAbout Meredith Poll\n\nThe Meredith Poll asks North Carolinians their opinions on a variety of social and political public issues. It is housed in the Department of History, Political Science, and International Studies at Meredith College, one of the largest women\u2019s colleges in the Southeast. The Meredith Poll was launched in the spring of 2015 as part of Meredith\u2019s commitment to civic engagement.",

        "text": "If Trump wins the election, US parks and wildlife will face a new age of mining\n\n\n\n\nThis is the first part of the standfirst This is the second part of the standfirst Headline what's at stake?\n\nView image in fullscreen Caribou in the Arctic national wildlife refuge in 2017. Photograph: The Asahi Shimbun via Getty Images\n\nThis article was produced in partnership with the non-profit newsroom Type Investigations, with support from the Wayne Barrett Project.\n\nImagine, for a moment, oil and gas infrastructure carving up Alaska\u2019s far northern tundra, a refuge for migrating caribou and polar bears. Copper-nickel mines on the doorstep of one of the largest wilderness areas east of the Rockies, a nearly 1.1m-acre (450,000-hectare) expanse of pristine lakes and forests full of loons, wolves and moose. Or uranium and coal exploration in once-protected landscapes, including areas bordering the Grand Canyon.\n\nIf Donald Trump wins the US presidential election in November, these projects will probably be on the table as part of an energy-dominance agenda focused on resource extraction. \u201cWe will drill, baby, drill,\u201d Trump said in July as he officially accepted the Republican nomination at the party\u2019s national convention in Milwaukee.\n\nIndeed, early plans suggest that Trump aims to radically remake the Department of the Interior, which oversees more than 500m acres (200m hectares) of public lands, manages the country\u2019s national parks and wildlife refuges, and is responsible for protecting endangered species. Whereas Joe Biden made safeguarding public lands and the transition to green energy a centerpiece of his time in office, Trump and his allies would reverse many of Biden\u2019s policies, remake the civil service and implement a new agenda focused on slashing regulations, weakening environmental protections, and expanding oil and gas development across the American west.\n\nOne of the figures involved in crafting this vision is Daniel Jorjani, who served as the top solicitor at the interior department during Trump\u2019s term, according to two sources who have spoken with Jorjani recently. A lawyer who formerly worked for the organizations affiliated with the conservative mega-donors Charles and David Koch, Jorjani currently serves as chief operating officer and principal deputy general counsel for the far-right advocacy group Citizens United, whose president, David Bossie, was Trump\u2019s deputy campaign manager in 2016.\n\nView image in fullscreen The Brooks range as seen from the Dalton highway in North Slope Borough, Alaska, in May 2024. Photograph: Lance King/Getty Images\n\nLynn Scarlett, who served as deputy secretary of the interior under George W Bush, said Jorjani, who was her chief of staff, was \u201cworking on interior policy issues as part of the Trump team\u201d.\n\nIn a recent post on his LinkedIn profile, Jorjani said he was part of the \u201cTrump Campaign Legal Team\u201d at the convention, where he was involved in advancing the Republican party\u2019s platform, which promised to \u201cunleash American Energy\u201d. (He later clarified that his work at the convention was done \u201cin a personal capacity\u201d.) He was also recently appointed to the state air pollution control board in Virginia, and one of the sources speculated that he could be tapped for a top position at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or the White House Council on Environmental Quality in a future Trump administration.\n\nJorjani did not respond to requests for comment, including questions about his relationship with the Trump campaign and his potential roles if Trump retakes the White House.\n\nView image in fullscreen Daniel Jorjani. Photograph: @DOIJorjani via X\n\nWhat exactly do Jorjani and other Trump supporters hope to do if Trump retakes the White House? Trump\u2019s official campaign platform, known as Agenda 47, is vague. But conservative allies have drafted detailed plans to abolish or dismantle scientific research divisions within multiple federal agencies, hobble decades-old environmental laws and repeal the federal Antiquities Act, which has been used by presidents since Theodore Roosevelt to designate large swaths of public land as national monuments, protecting them from development.\n\nRead more from the series\n\nSensitive wildlands \u2013 such as the Boundary Waters Canoe Area wilderness in Minnesota, the Chaco Culture historic national park in New Mexico and the Arctic national wildlife refuge in Alaska, which was opened to oil and gas leasing during Trump\u2019s first term \u2013 will also be under renewed threat from mining or oil and gas development. Meanwhile, imperiled species like grizzly bears and sage grouse will probably see their protections diminished or stripped away entirely.\n\n\u201cThe playbook is basically rinse and repeat,\u201d said David Hayes, who served as deputy secretary at the interior department under Barack Obama and Bill Clinton. \u201cIt is a completely backward-looking agenda.\u201d\n\n\u2018It\u2019s scary how well-organized they are\u2019\n\nJorjani is part of a larger constellation of conservative groups and political operatives angling for power and influence in a second Trump administration. The Heritage Foundation, a conservative thinktank, has put together Project 2025, a policy blueprint designed to help the Trump administration hit the ground running in a second term. The document includes a chapter on the interior department written by William Perry Pendley, who served as acting director of the Bureau of Land Management under Trump and was a protege of James Watt, the controversial interior secretary during the early years of the Reagan administration. Though his tenure was brief, Watt became known for leasing public lands at artificially low prices and attempting to sell federal land to reduce the national debt.\n\nThough Trump has recently tried to distance his campaign from the Heritage Foundation\u2019s work, many of the Project 2025 proposals align with his own positions, especially when it comes to resource extraction. The document, parts of which were written by oil and gas industry representatives, calls for reinstating Trump\u2019s energy-dominance agenda, reducing national monument designations and weakening protections for endangered species.\n\nDavid Bernhardt, who served as Trump\u2019s interior secretary from 2019 to 2021, has been a central figure in the new network of policy organizations aligned with the Trump agenda. Bernhardt is currently chair of the Center for American Freedom at the America First Policy Institute, a thinktank founded by former Trump staffers Linda McMahon, Brooke Rollins and Larry Kudlow in 2021. (McMahon is now leading the campaign\u2019s transition team.) Last year he published a book, You Report to Me: Accountability for the Failing Administrative State, which offers a detailed account of his plans to assert control over the federal bureaucracy during a future conservative administration.\n\nView image in fullscreen Then secretary of the interior, David Bernhardt, speaks at the White House on 8 July 2019. Photograph: Evan Vucci/AP\n\nCentral to this project is the creation of a new category of federal employment, known as Schedule F, that would allow Trump to fire thousands of civil servants involved in policymaking and replace them with allies \u2013 a scheme Trump implemented during the final months of his first term but which the Biden administration quickly repealed. Employees in this category, according to Bernhardt, \u201cwould have the same removal appeal rights as political appointees, which is to say they would not have any\u201d.\n\nInstalling political appointees \u2013 many of them former lobbyists, industry officials or conservative activists \u2013 in key positions could lead to another four years of ethics scandals, which hovered over Trump\u2019s interior department during the entire length of his first term, often serving as a distraction from putting in place a conservative agenda. The most high-profile imbroglios involved the former interior secretary Ryan Zinke \u2013 who resigned in late 2018 amid investigations by the agency\u2019s inspector general into whether he had used his office for personal gain. But interior department political appointees lower in the hierarchy also repeatedly ran afoul of federal ethics rules that are meant to prevent conflicts of interest.\n\n\u201cThere is no reason to believe that [another Trump] administration would be more ethical,\u201d said Kedric Payne, vice-president at the Campaign Legal Center, a non-partisan organization that advocates for ethics in government.\n\nView image in fullscreen Lynn Scarlett with other members of the George W Bush administration during an executive order signing on 17 December 2004. Photograph: Paul Morse/White House via Getty Images\n\nThis time, however, preparations for a second Trump administration have taken on a greater degree of professionalism. Policy ideas \u2013 and the personnel to implement them \u2013 are being mapped out well in advance.\n\n\u201cIt is scary how well-organized they are,\u201d said a former interior department employee who has communicated with Jorjani.\n\nBernhardt did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nScarlett, who went on to work for the Nature Conservancy before retiring in 2021, described Jorjani as a \u201cvery dedicated conservative Republican\u201d, who is well-positioned to implement the policies the Heritage Foundation and others have laid out. She also said the chaos and incompetence of the first Trump administration was unlikely to repeat itself.\n\n\u201cThis is a different situation,\u201d Scarlett said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to go in with people who have experience and knowledge \u2026 and really get the agenda moving from day one.\u201d\n\n\u2018Vast stores of liquid gold\u2019\n\nTrump has already made clear his desire to court the oil and gas industry. In April, according to the Washington Post, Trump met with oil executives at his Mar-a-Lago resort and promised to reverse many of Biden\u2019s environmental policies in exchange for $1bn in campaign donations. Oil and gas production under Biden has reached record highs and his administration approved the huge Willow project in Alaska, but Trump is seen as a figure who would impose few if any limits on the industry.\n\nAt another fundraiser organized by the oil company Continental Resources\u2019 Harold Hamm and other industry executives, Trump said he would open more federal land to drilling on and offshore, and referred to the Arctic national wildlife refuge \u2013 a 19m-acre (7.7m-hectare) preserve on Alaska\u2019s north slope \u2013 as the \u201cbiggest oil farm\u201d. Through his personal connections, Hamm has already helped to raise millions of dollars from the oil and gas industry to support Trump\u2019s campaign.\n\nThe refuge\u2019s coastal plain was an early target of the Trump administration and a centerpiece of his energy-dominance agenda. The first ever lease sale in the refuge took place on 6 January 2021, the same day rioters stormed the US Capitol. Though major industry players had expressed little interest in drilling in this corner of Alaska, Trump and his allies prioritized opening it up to exploration and development.\n\nThe Biden administration canceled the leases and is finalizing a supplemental environmental impact statement that is expected to dramatically reduce the amount of land open to oil and gas exploration and development. Biden also raised royalty rates for oil, gas and coal production on federal land, issued new rules designed to curb the venting and flaring of natural gas, and took measures to account for the long-term climate impacts of fossil fuel production.\n\nA second Trump administration would probably pick up where the first left off, however, reinstating quarterly lease sales wherever possible \u2013 as outlined by Project 2025 \u2013 and opening up the \u201cvast stores of liquid gold on America\u2019s public land\u201d, according to the campaign\u2019s website.\n\n\u201cThe main themes of this playbook are to drill and pollute everywhere without regard for communities and wildlife, while erasing public parks, monuments and wildlife refuges from the map,\u201d said Nicole Gentile, senior director for conservation at the Center for American Progress.\n\nAttacks on climate science\n\nTrump\u2019s embrace of fossil fuels has also been coupled with \u2013 and in many ways depends on \u2013 a rejection of climate science. During Trump\u2019s first term, political appointees sidelined climate scientists across government agencies. The interior department\u2019s strategic plan was scrubbed of any mention of climate change. Trump officials discredited the work of its top climate scientists and dismissed the 2,000-page federal review of the risks of global warming known as the National Climate Assessment, released in 2018, as \u201cnot based on facts\u201d. (The next climate assessment is due to be published in 2027, which means it will be heavily influenced by the next administration.)\n\nAt the US Geological Survey, political appointees tried to derail climate research by focusing only on a narrow 10-year time horizon \u2013 an unprecedented attack on the scientific process that outraged career employees. But if Trump is granted the power to fire thousands of civil servants, he would have little trouble pushing through his agenda in a second term.\n\nView image in fullscreen People protest in Washington DC against oil and gas drilling in the Arctic national wildlife refuge in 2017. Composite: Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call via Getty Images/Guardian Design Team\n\nRecent judicial decisions will also help. The supreme court has limited the EPA\u2019s ability to address climate change through the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts, and overturned the Chevron doctrine, which for decades gave federal agencies the authority to interpret legal statutes. Now, a second Trump administration will have more leeway to advance its own policy priorities, and career civil servants, who have years of knowledge and expertise, will have less power to stand in the way.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s much more infrastructure in place for a second Trump term to move forward very quickly with their agenda,\u201d said Erik Schlenker-Goodrich, executive director of the Western Environmental Law Center.\n\nLandmark environmental laws under threat\n\nMajor laws which have formed the bedrock of environmental preservation in the United States are also likely to come under legal and administrative attack during a second Trump presidency.\n\nVeterans of Trump\u2019s interior department have made known their desire to shrink national monuments and eviscerate the Antiquities Act. Project 2025 explicitly calls for the repeal of the law, which has helped protect such national treasures as the Grand Canyon. Conservative activists and lawyers have also long viewed other major national monuments like Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante, both in Utah, as targets for coal, oil and uranium development.\n\nMeanwhile, the supreme court\u2019s chief justice, John Roberts, in a 2021 statement, all but invited conservative lawyers to challenge the law through litigation, and a Trump administration is unlikely to defend it if such legal action proceeds. The nearly 120-year-old law may not survive another four years of Trump.\n\nThe Endangered Species Act, which is broadly popular with the American public, is also likely to face attacks. During Trump\u2019s first term, the interior department focused on watering down the law\u2019s strongest provisions, delisting species and pushing development in sensitive wildlife habitat. These will probably be priorities again.\n\n\u201cThey haven\u2019t been particularly shy about their agenda, it is all spelled out,\u201d said Brett Hartl, the chief political strategist at the Center for Biological Diversity Action Fund, a wildlife conservation advocacy group. \u201cIt is not going to be better than the first time through.\u201d",

        "text": "Americans Still Favor Replacing Electoral College System\nWASHINGTON, D.C. -- Americans favor amending the Constitution to elect presidents based on the popular vote (58%) rather than keeping the current system where the winner is determined by Electoral College votes (39%). The level of support for a popular-vote system has been consistent in most Gallup surveys since the question was first asked in 2000. The main exception was an even division in a poll taken after the 2016 election, in which Hillary Clinton won the popular vote and Donald Trump the electoral vote. Although this situation has been rare, it also occurred in 2000.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nThe latest update is based on a Sept. 3-15 Gallup poll.\n\nGallup has found higher support for a popular-vote constitutional amendment in the past using a different question wording. In November 1968, after a closely contested presidential election, 80% of U.S. adults said they \u201cwould approve\u201d of an amendment to \u201cdo away with the Electoral College and base the election of a president on the total vote cast throughout the nation.\u201d\n\nThe November 1968 poll was the high point in support for measurements using that question wording, though most other surveys found at least two-thirds of the public in favor, including in May 1968 (66%), January 1977 (73%) and November 1980 (67%). The lone exception was a January 1967 poll in which 58% approved.\n\nDemocrats Favor Popular Vote; Republicans, Electoral College\n\nSince 2000, Democrats have been consistently more likely than Republicans, and independents, to favor amending the Constitution to base the presidential election winner on the popular vote. Democrats\u2019 support, currently at 82%, has been higher since 2016 than before.\n\nAfter the 2016 election, 17% of Republicans were in favor of having the president be chosen by popular vote, while 81% wanted to keep the Electoral College system. Since then, Republican support has edged back up to 32%, but it remains below where it was before 2016. Sixty-six percent of Republicans currently favor keeping the Electoral College system.\n\nPolitical independents show support that is similar today to what it was in 2000, though they, too, were less supportive of amending the Constitution immediately after the 2016 election.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nPartisans\u2019 preferences are generally aligned with whichever format would tend to benefit their party in presidential elections. The Democratic Party has won the popular vote in all but one election since 1992 (the 2004 election). The two elections in which the Electoral College vote winner did not win the popular vote saw Republicans George W. Bush in 2000 and Trump in 2016 become president.\n\nIn Gallup polls on the Electoral College in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, Republicans and Democrats tended to be about equally likely to approve of an amendment to abolish the Electoral College. In those surveys, an average of 70% of Republicans and 66% of Democrats (and 74% of independents) approved of changing the Constitution to elect the president based on the popular vote.\n\nBottom Line\n\nIf it were up to a simple majority of Americans, the Constitution would be amended to elect the president based on the nationwide popular vote. But the Constitution specifically gives electors in each state the task of electing the president, and constitutional amendments have been rare in the nation\u2019s history.\n\nSupport for abolishing the Electoral College is lower now than in the 20th century, largely because partisan divisions have emerged. The recognition that each approach -- the popular vote and Electoral College -- favors a different party complicates reaching national consensus on the matter.\n\nThe current system arose from a compromise between constitutional framers wanting citizens to directly elect the president and those wanting Congress to choose the chief executive. The founders decided to create a temporary, intermediate body between voters and elected officials to make the choice.\n\nThe possibility of amending the Constitution is remote, given the need for supermajority support in Congress, or the alternative of two-thirds of states calling for a convention to change it. Regardless of the approach, three-quarters of states would then need to ratify the amendment.\n\nAs an alternative to an amendment, a group of states has entered into a compact to award their states\u2019 electoral votes to the winner of the national popular vote. That agreement would go into effect once participating states' electoral votes total 270 (the number a candidate needs to win the presidency). The 17 states (along with the District of Columbia) currently committed to the agreement total 209 electoral votes. Other states are considering adopting the proposal. If that compact went into effect, it would be sure to face legal challenges from supporters of the Electoral College process, and federal courts (if not the U.S. Supreme Court) would most likely decide the issue.\n\nTo stay up to date with the latest Gallup News insights and updates, follow us on X @Gallup.\n\nLearn more about how the Gallup Poll Social Series works.\n\nView complete question responses and trends (PDF download).\n\n###Embeddable###",

        "text": "America's Big Corporate Divide As US Election Comes Knocking On The Door\nAmerica is increasingly divided on political lines as the 2024 Presidential election approaches. Though open and upfront divergence in political ideology is not uncommon among citizens, especially in democracies and near elections, another big divide has emerged in the run-up to the November polls - that of Corporate America.\n\nTech behemoths, banking giants, large corporations and even regional and small firms stand on either side of this political divide.\n\nOn November 5, citizens across the US will vote for their next president between Democrat candidate Kamala Harris and her Republican rival Donald Trump. The divide is straightforward - \"liberal and left-leaning\" Kamala Harris vs \"protectionist and right-leaning\" Donald Trump.\n\nTECH BEHEMOTHS DIVIDED\n\nBig tech has joined the cause, aligning themselves to their chosen candidate. Employees at Microsoft, Google (Alphabet), Amazon, and Sun Microsystems have donated millions of dollars to Kamala Harris's campaign, according the data made public by political watchdog OpenSecrets. The contribution to Ms Harris's campaign is significantly more than what was given to the Trump campaign.\n\nTech billionaires like Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg are, however, rallying strongly for Donald Trump. The contributions they have made directly to the Trump campaign are not available at the moment.\n\nAccording to the a CNN report, Meta chief executive Zuckerberg made public statements supporting right-wing \"censorship\" narratives and praised Donald Trump for being a \"badass\". He later claimed he wanted to appear \"neutral\" and nonpartisan.\n\nThe report also said that Mr Zuckerberg sent a letter to the powerful House Judiciary Committee, stating that the Biden administration had \"pressured\" Meta to \"censor\" content.\n\n\"In 2021, senior officials from the Biden Administration, including the White House, repeatedly pressured our teams for months to censor certain COVID-19 content, including humor and satire, and expressed a lot of frustration with our teams when we didn't agree,\" Mr Zuckerberg said.\n\nThe letter was immediately weaponised by Trump, who claimed once again that the 2020 election was stolen.\n\nElon Musk, however, has been far more open in his support for Trump. According to ta report in the Wall Street Journal, Musk had said in July that he is personally donating $45 million every month to an organisation called America PAC, which in turn looks after the Trump campaign.\n\nAnother big venture capitalist who is openly backing Donald Trump is Peter Theil.\n\nIndian-American billionaire and co-founder of Sun Microsystems, Vinod Khosla, and venture capitalist Reid Hoffman are among those strongly backing Kamala Harris.\n\nElection funding data reveals that Sundar Pichai-led Google (Alphabet), and its subsidiaries have donated $2.16 million to Kamala Harris. In comparison, the same companies donated much smaller amounts to the Trump campaign.\n\nWhile Satya Nadella-led Microsoft donated $1.1 million to Kamala Harris's campaign, Jeff Bezos-led Amazon donated $1 million. In comparison, the same groups made much lower contributions to the Trump campaign - $88,000 from Microsoft and $116,000 from Amazon and their employees.\n\nMore than a hundred venture capitalists and big tech companies in Silicon Valley, which has largely been left-leaning in the past, have backed Kamala Harris.\n\nBANKING AND OIL GIANTS\n\nBanking corporations and crude oil firms appear to be leaning towards Trump, thanks to his promise of less tax and less regulation in these sectors. Even the US stock market reflected that sentiment when there were assassination attempts against the Republican leader.\n\nAccording to a Bloomberg report, CEOs of Oil giants have been getting signals from Donald Trump to go big on drilling due to Trump's love for oil. Trump has openly said that he does not believe in Climate Change and has called it a \"lie\". He has also said that he believes in coal and oil for energy because of the advantage United States has in the sector. The ex-President has also faced criticism from climate activists like Greta Thunberg for his view on the issue.\n\n\"We have more liquid gold than anybody,\" Trump had told Businessweek in July.\n\nAccording to the Bloomberg report, banking chiefs see an opportunity for more mergers and acquisitions in the energy sector, bringing a windfall in fees. The capital markets hope to send fresh dollars into pipelines, liquefied natural gas terminals and electric transmissions capabilities - and maybe even a new commitment to nuclear energy infrastructure.\n\nBankers also believe that strict rules which have been implemented under the Biden administration will be rolled back should Donald Trump. Some believe that new banking rules suggested by the Biden Administration will not even see the light of day.\n\nBig banking giants and Oil firms are hence backing Donald Trump.\n\nTRUMP vs HARRIS - A LOOK AT THE TOP CONTRIBUTORS\n\nAccording to political funding analysts OpenSecrets, the following table shows corporations and individuals who have made the largest monetary contributions to the Kamala Harris and Donald Trump campaigns.\n\nKAMALA HARRIS CAMPAIGN - TOP CONTRIBUTIONS\n\nDONALD TRUMP CAMPAIGN - TOP CONTRIBUTIONS",

        "text": "Harris, Visiting Border, Calls for Extending Restrictions and Adding Security: Sept. 27 Campaign News\nFormer President Donald J. Trump met with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine at Trump Tower in New York on Friday.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky wore a grim expression as he stood next to former President Donald J. Trump. The two leaders were appearing on Fox News after their meeting on Friday in Trump Tower, their first in five years.\n\nAs Mr. Zelensky stood silently beside him, Mr. Trump presented the Russia-Ukraine war as one that both sides wanted to end, including its instigator, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.\n\nMr. Trump did not fault the Russian leader for the invasion or for the illegal seizure of territory or for the thousands of Ukrainians he has bombed out of existence. Instead, the former president described the situation as if it were a dispute between two parties operating in good faith that could be resolved in a \u201cfair deal,\u201d but only if he returns to the White House.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been saying that I believe if I win, we\u2019re going to have a very fair, and I think, actually rather rapid deal,\u201d Mr. Trump said. The war, he added, \u201cshould stop, and the president wants it to stop. I\u2019m sure President Putin wants it to stop. And that\u2019s a good combination. So we want to have a fair deal for everybody.\u201d\n\nMr. Zelensky is in a difficult position with Mr. Trump. He knows Mr. Trump has a solid chance of winning in November, and that if he does, he will immediately face a decision over how much support to give to Ukraine and what posture the United States will take in the conflict. Earlier this week, Mr. Zelensky made mildly critical comments about Mr. Trump that almost scuttled their meeting.\n\nAs he stood alongside Mr. Trump on Fox News on Friday, Mr. Zelensky was diplomatic but struggled to make clear where he thought the blame resided.\n\n\u201cThis war shouldn\u2019t be started, and I think that the problem that Putin killed so many people and, of course, we need to do everything to pressure him to stop this war,\u201d Mr. Zelensky said. \u201cHe is on our territory, that\u2019s the most important to understand. He is on our territory, and how to stop the war to pressure him as we can. As we can \u2014 we have to do it.\u201d\n\nThe two leaders had just spent roughly an hour together in the conference room on the 25th floor of Trump Tower on Friday morning. They were both in uniform. Mr. Trump wore shiny dress shoes, a blue suit and a long red tie. Mr. Zelensky was in work boots, cargo pants and an olive-green sweatshirt.\n\nThe last time they were together, in September 2019, Mr. Trump was in the middle of a scandal \u2014 one of the biggest of his presidency \u2014 over a phone call he had made to Mr. Zelensky in which he pressured the Ukrainian leader to investigate his political rival, Joe Biden.\n\nNow, only six weeks before Election Day, Mr. Zelensky had arrived as a wartime leader to shore up a shaky relationship.\n\nBefore the meeting, as they emerged from double doors together, Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky paused at the head of a large conference table to deliver brief remarks to reporters.\n\n\u201cI think that we can work out something that\u2019s good for both sides,\u201d Mr. Trump said, insisting that if he won the election, he would be able to end the war even before taking office on Jan. 20.\n\nMr. Zelensky has previously expressed skepticism over Mr. Trump\u2019s claims that he could rapidly end the war. And Mr. Trump\u2019s public statements over the past two years have given the Ukrainians plenty of reasons to be concerned. He initially described the 2022 invasion of Ukraine by Mr. Putin as an act of \u201cgenius.\u201d And he has repeatedly insisted that he could resolve the conflict within 24 hours \u2014 a message that some in Ukraine take to mean that he would pressure them to capitulate to Russia.\n\n\u201cWe have common view that the war in Ukraine has to be stopped,\u201d Mr. Zelensky said on Friday as he stood beside Mr. Trump. He added: \u201cAnd Putin can\u2019t win, and Ukraine has to prevail.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s assertion that both sides want a deal sidesteps a core question: Whether leaving Russia with a part of Ukraine \u2014 it now controls around 20 percent \u2014 rewards aggression, and would only lead in time to another Russian invasion, perhaps in Ukraine, perhaps elsewhere. It takes no moral position on whether invading sovereign nations is a fundamental violation of international law.\n\nDespite Mr. Trump\u2019s statement, \u201cthere is zero indication that President Putin is interested in a peace deal that would \u2014 or should \u2014 be acceptable to Ukraine or NATO,\u201d said Seth Jones, a former Defense Department official who is now a scholar at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nMr. Jones said that Mr. Putin \u201cwants to hold onto Ukrainian territory that he has conquered by brute force, neuter Ukraine\u2019s ability to defend itself and make Ukraine a Russian client state. This type of \u2018deal\u2019 would put countries on NATO\u2019s eastern flank, such as Poland and the Baltic States, in grave danger of future Russian aggression.\u201d\n\nRichard N. Haass, a former national security official and senior diplomat who is the president emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations, said the Russian leader \u201chas made clear he wants a deal that is one-sided and gives him territory permanently.\u201d He noted that making diplomacy work will require \u201ckeeping the pressure on Russia by keeping the U.S. support going, and it\u2019s not clear Donald Trump wants to continue that.\u201d\n\nMorgan Finkelstein, a campaign spokeswoman for Mr. Trump\u2019s Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, said in a statement, \u201cThe only Ukraine deal Trump wants is one that benefits Putin, not Ukraine.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump has not directly answered whether he wants Ukraine to win the war, and it\u2019s unclear what any such victory would look like. Mr. Zelensky wants more American weapons, and his plan is to strike back harder at Russia, with continued attacks inside Russia\u2019s borders. While it seems unlikely Ukraine will be able to remove Russia entirely from its territory, Mr. Zelensky wants to put pressure on Mr. Putin to build up a stronger negotiating position for a peace deal with security guarantees for Ukraine.\n\nMr. Zelensky told reporters at Trump Tower that he was there to discuss his plan to bring about a \u201cjust peace.\u201d He was careful to remain apolitical in his remarks. Mr. Zelensky has tried to maintain good relations with both Republicans and Democrats, given that the Ukrainian military relies on bipartisan support from Congress for the continuing supply of high-powered weapons. Mr. Zelensky emphasized that he had met with both presidential candidates this week.\n\nBut his efforts on Friday morning to stay out of U.S. domestic politics lasted about three minutes.\n\nMr. Trump immediately dragged the Ukrainian leader back into an episode that tested the relationship between the two countries when he was president. Mr. Trump said, admiringly, that Mr. Zelensky was \u201clike a piece of steel\u201d for the way he had handled the aftermath of the phone call between the leaders in 2019 that led to Mr. Trump\u2019s first impeachment.\n\nAt the time, Mr. Trump was holding up aid to Ukraine to increase his leverage over Mr. Zelensky, whom he was pressing to open a corruption investigation into the Biden family. Mr. Zelensky said publicly that he had felt no pressure on the call \u2014 a statement Mr. Trump emphasized as the basis for his warm feelings toward the Ukrainian president.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018President Trump did absolutely nothing wrong,\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump recalled, misquoting Mr. Zelensky, who stood beside him awkwardly. \u201cHe said it loud and clear, and the impeachment hoax died right there.\u201d\n\nMr. Zelensky has said multiple times that he is ready to work with whoever wins the U.S. presidential election in November. \u201cIf Mr. Donald Trump becomes president, then we will work with him,\u201d he said at a news conference this summer. \u201cI am not afraid of it.\u201d\n\nUkrainian officials started building bridges with Mr. Trump\u2019s camp this year, hoping to shape his views on Ukraine in case he is elected. A group of Ukrainian lawmakers met with former Trump administration officials in March.\n\nBut as the U.S. election nears, Ukrainian officials have grown increasingly concerned about Mr. Trump\u2019s claims that he would end the war swiftly if re-elected, fearing this could result in Ukraine being forced to cede significant territory to Russia.\n\nBreaking with his self-professed neutrality, Mr. Zelensky questioned Mr. Trump\u2019s plan to end the war in a recent interview with The New Yorker. He also described Mr. Trump\u2019s running mate, Senator JD Vance of Ohio, who has been deeply critical of previous U.S. aid packages for Ukraine, as \u201ctoo radical.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy feeling is that Trump doesn\u2019t really know how to stop the war even if he might think he knows how,\u201d Mr. Zelensky said in the interview. \u201cWith this war, oftentimes, the deeper you look at it, the less you understand.\u201d\n\nMr. Zelensky\u2019s comments to the magazine infuriated the Trump team \u2014 so much that the Trump Tower meeting almost didn\u2019t happen.\n\nTrump allies were also angry about a visit Mr. Zelensky made on Tuesday to a factory in Pennsylvania that supplies munitions for the war. Some close to Mr. Trump claimed that the appearance was \u201celection interference\u201d because Mr. Zelensky had posed for photos with prominent Democrats in the battleground state.\n\nThe fury in Mr. Trump\u2019s orbit became so hot that Representative James Comer of Kentucky, the Republican chairman of the House Oversight and Accountability Committee, began an inquiry on Wednesday into Mr. Zelensky\u2019s trip to Pennsylvania, implying that it was an improper campaign stop on behalf of Ms. Harris.\n\nThe House speaker, Mike Johnson, released an extraordinary public statement calling on Mr. Zelensky to fire his ambassador to the United States. The ambassador, Oksana Markarova, did not attend Friday\u2019s meeting.\n\nAt a campaign event on Wednesday, Mr. Trump criticized Mr. Zelensky for being someone who \u201crefuses to make a deal\u201d with Russia despite the devastation in the country. Mr. Trump said that Mr. Zelensky was \u201cmaking little nasty aspersions\u201d toward him.\n\nStill, Mr. Trump did not go as far in attacking Mr. Zelensky as some of his more anti-Ukraine allies had wanted. At least one adviser tried to rile up Mr. Trump about how Mr. Zelensky was effectively campaigning for Democrats, but the former president dismissed the suggestion, saying that he didn\u2019t want to talk about it, according to a person with direct knowledge of the conversation who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nMr. Zelensky sent a warm personal note to Mr. Trump to try to get the relationship back on track, telling him it was \u201cimportant for us to have a personal contact and to understand each other 100 percent.\u201d\n\nAfter receiving the note, Mr. Trump agreed to meet with Mr. Zelensky, but he also posted the private message on his social media website, Truth Social, on Thursday. The former president has a history of publicizing private communications when he thinks they are politically advantageous. In this case, the message showed that it was Mr. Zelensky who sought the meeting.\n\nAnalysts in Ukraine say the Zelensky administration has been developing strategies to appeal to Mr. Trump\u2019s key stated interests, such as shoring up the American economy. Some analysts there take comfort in the fact that after Russia illegally annexed Crimea in 2014, Mr. Trump reversed President Barack Obama\u2019s policy of not providing lethal weapons to Ukraine. They were also encouraged to see Mr. Trump soft-pedal his opposition to additional American aid to Ukraine, giving Republican members of Congress the breathing room to vote in favor of the military package after months of holding back.\n\nAt the meeting on Friday, Mr. Trump sat at the center of the table, framed by American flags. There was no Ukrainian flag, an exclusion that would be out of the norm if it were an official state visit.\n\nSeveral critical Trump advisers were also present. Richard Grenell, Mr. Trump\u2019s former acting director of national intelligence, attended. Mr. Trump\u2019s top political advisers, Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, sat at the conference table to Mr. Trump\u2019s left. Mr. Zelensky brought his closest aide, his chief of staff, Andriy Yermak.\n\nMr. Trump said in the Fox News interview that he \u201clearned a lot\u201d in the meeting. He said he was open to meeting again, and Mr. Zelensky took the opportunity to invite Mr. Trump to visit Ukraine.\n\n\u201cI will,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\nIn a post on X, Mr. Zelensky described the meeting as \u201cvery productive.\u201d\n\n\u201cI presented him our Victory Plan, and we thoroughly reviewed the situation in Ukraine and the consequences of the war for our people,\u201d Mr. Zelensky wrote in the post. \u201cMany details were discussed. I am grateful for this meeting. A just peace is needed. We share the common view that the war in Ukraine must be stopped. Putin cannot win. Ukrainians must prevail.\u201d\n\nMr. Zelensky\u2019s final assertion \u2014 that Ukraine must prevail and Mr. Putin must be denied a victory \u2014 goes further than anything Mr. Trump has said in public.\n\nMichael Gold contributed reporting.",

        "text": "Why Nevada is so close in 2024\nThe entire nation will vote on the next president of the United States this fall, but the election will likely come down to seven key swing states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. With the outsized importance of these states, it's worth taking a closer look at the data we have in each of them \u2014 not just where the presidential race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump stands today, but also each candidate's path to victory and what issues could tip the election. Second up: the Silver State, Nevada, which is part of an increasingly purple swath in the Southwest.\n\nThe history\n\nWith one exception \u2014 1976 \u2014 Nevada voted for the winner in every presidential contest from 1912 until 2016, when it broke its winning streak by voting for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton by just over 2 points. While it has only six electoral votes, those votes have proven decisive in the tight contests of the recent era. Nevada helped elect President Joe Biden in 2020, who carried the state by a nearly identical margin to Clinton's, and in 2022, the purple state helped determine control of the Senate in a close race that took days to call.\n\nThe results of the last six presidential elections in Nevada compared with the national popular vote. Katie Marriner and Amina Brown for 538\n\nPresidential margins in the state have been narrow over the last two decades (with the exception of former President Barack Obama's relatively big wins in 2008 and 2012) and in many cases have closely approximated the national popular vote. Despite having consistently tight races, the state has been steadily blue in presidential races since 2008, while also trending right compared to the country as a whole. In 2008, Obama won Nevada by 12 percentage points, compared to his 7-point win nationally, putting the state 5 points to the left of the country. But in each election since then, Nevada has inched right. In 2020, Biden won nationally by 4 points, but only won the Silver State by 2, placing it to the right of the national popular vote for the first time since the 2004 presidential election.\n\nThe 2024 polls\n\nPolls show an even closer race this year. Harris leads by about 1 point in 538's polling average of the state.* That's a little worse than her performance nationally, where she leads Trump by nearly 3 points, but it's an improvement over Biden, who was trailing Trump in the state.\n\n538's 2024 presidential polling average in Nevada. 538 Photo Illustration\n\nThe demographics\n\nNearly three-fourths of Nevada's population of 3.1 million lives in the Las Vegas metropolitan area in the state's southern tip, giving the city a dominant place in the electoral politics of the Silver State. Beyond that, the Reno metropolitan area on the state's western bend clocks in with nearly half a million people, while most of the rest of the state is an extremely rural desert.\n\nA little over 28 percent of the state's total population is Hispanic or Latino, making it the largest minority group in the state. Indeed, the state is home to the first Latina senator, Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, and targeting Latinos in the Las Vegas area has been an important strategy for both parties. A report from the University of Southern California's Center for Inclusive Democracy found that while only about half of Latino voters across the country turned out in 2020 compared to about two-thirds of the general population, they still made up 15 percent of all voters in Nevada that year. And, as we see in polls across the country, Republicans seem to be making gains with these voters; in an average of polls conducted over the last month, Nevada Latino voters said they would vote for Harris over Trump by a 21-point margin (58 percent to 37 percent)**, a slight drop from the 26-point margin Biden had over Trump among the demographic in 2020, but about on par with national polling among Latino voters.\n\nThe state is also growing and diversifying rapidly. Its population increased 15 percent between 2010 and 2020, driven by growth among minority groups as the white population shrank, according to the Center for Inclusive Democracy report. That included around 40 percent growth in both Asian and Black populations in the state. Overall, one-third of Nevada voters in 2020 were nonwhite \u2014 a number that could increase this year if those demographic trends have continued.\n\nThe state also has a slightly lower percentage of adults with at least a bachelor's degree \u2014 29 percent \u2014 compared to 36 percent nationwide. The divide between voters with or without college degrees has been one of the most important political divides of the past few elections, and voters without college degrees have become another battleground demographic group of sorts. Since his first presidential run, Trump has dominated among white voters without college degrees, while college graduates have migrated solidly into the Democratic Party. And while Black and Latino voters still overwhelmingly cast their ballots for Democrats in recent elections, those without college degrees have been trending toward the Republican Party like their white counterparts have been.\n\nAll of that means that the state abounds with key demographic groups for each party, which helps explain why the elections there have been so close.\n\nThe issues\n\nTo a unique degree, Nevada's economy depends on the hospitality industry. It was among the states most impacted by the recession during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the pandemic's economic impacts were particularly lasting there.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the top issue for Nevada voters going into the election is the economy, which 39 percent of likely voters named as the most important issue facing their state in an Emerson College/The Hill poll of swing states from September. But that's actually a bit less than the share of voters nationally (43 percent) who said the same in a similar poll from Emerson College in September. In fact, with the exception of Arizona, Nevada voters were the least likely of all swing-state voters to name the economy as their top issue. Instead, many appear to be focused on a related issue that has been particularly troubling in the state: housing.\n\nHousing affordability was the second most important issue to Nevada voters, with 16 percent naming it as their top issue, the highest of any state in the Emerson swing-state surveys. Nevada's surge of new residents, concentrated in the Las Vegas area, has put pressure on a housing market struggling to keep up with demand. Many new residents are moving in from California, which has a much higher cost of living, making Nevada a bargain for them but helping push prices out of reach for existing residents. According to Zillow, the Home Value Index in Nevada has grown 34 percent since the start of the Biden presidency, slightly faster than the rate of increase nationwide. The median rental price in Nevada is $2,075, which is $25 less than the national median but represents a $75 increase since September 2023. And Harris may have an advantage on the issue: According to a September Bloomberg/Morning Consult survey, Nevadans trust Harris over Trump on the issue of housing by a 10-point margin (49 percent to 39 percent of registered voters).\n\nOn the other hand, Trump appears to have an advantage on the economy in the state (as he does nationally). Fifty-three percent of registered voters in Nevada trust him more than Harris on the issue, according to an August CNN/SSRS poll. According to an earlier Emerson College/The Hill poll of the state, 71 percent of likely voters also support Trump's proposal (that's also been adopted by Harris) to eliminate taxes on tips, perhaps because so many Nevadans work in industries where they receive tips in addition to wages. Both candidates announced their support for the policy at rallies in Las Vegas.\n\nBeyond the economy, immigration is also a big issue for Nevadans, with 8 percent naming it as the most important issue facing their state in the Emerson College/The Hill September poll. A look at the demographic breakdown also shows that the issue is more complicated than topline numbers might indicate. Latinos care more about the economy (44 percent) and housing affordability (16 percent) than immigration (5 percent). White Nevadans were more likely to say immigration was their top issue (9 percent), but it still came in behind the economy (38 percent), housing affordability (15 percent) and threats to democracy (11 percent).\n\nThe downballot races\n\nNevada is also electing a U.S. senator this year. But while Cortez Masto's reelection was close in 2022, her fellow Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen is polling well ahead of her Republican challenger this year, Afghanistan war veteran Sam Brown. State voters will also be deciding whether to adopt a new voting system that would allow top-five, all-party primaries and ranked-choice voting in general elections, similar to a system currently in place in Alaska.\n\n538's 2024 U.S. Senate polling average in Nevada. 538 Photo Illustration\n\nAnother ballot measure will give Nevada voters the chance to decide whether to codify the right to abortion before fetal viability in the state constitution. (Abortion is currently protected in Nevada by state law.) While abortion is not the most important topic for voters in Nevada, the state is among the most liberal in the nation when it comes to wanting to ensure access. A full 80 percent of Nevada adults oppose criminalizing abortion before fetal viability, according to a survey from the University of Maryland Program for Public Consultation earlier this summer. And 64 percent would favor a federal law ensuring abortion access. Nevada is also the most supportive swing state when it comes to access to birth control: 90 percent of Nevada voters support the federal government continuing to require health insurance plans to cover long-term birth control, like IUDs. That's more than any other swing state polled and the U.S. as a whole.\n\nSome activists have been hoping that ballot measures like this might help Democrats at the top of the ticket, either by encouraging turnout among sympathetic demographic groups or keeping the issue of abortion (on which Democrats have a big lead) in the news. But the evidence for abortion-related ballot measures juicing turnout is fairly mixed.\n\nFootnotes\n\n*All numbers in this article are as of Sept. 27 at 1:30 p.m. Eastern.\n\n**Based on polls of likely and registered voters only (if a poll included results among both populations, we used likely voters). If a poll included both a head-to-head matchup between Harris and Trump and a version including third parties, we used the head-to-head version. Crosstabs among groups defined by pollsters as \"Latino\" and \"Hispanic\" are both included. Finally, if a polling organization (defined as a partnership between a pollster and sponsor, or a pollster alone if their work was not sponsored by an outside group) had more than one survey in the relevant time frame, only the most recent version was included. All polls conducted and released between Aug. 27 and Sept. 27 at 1:30 p.m. Eastern are included.",

        "text": "US charges Iranian operatives with hacking Trump campaign\nThe U.S. filed criminal charges against a trio of operatives tied to Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, alleging they carried out hacking activities aimed at disrupting the upcoming U.S. presidential election.\n\nThe allegations, unsealed Friday, say Masoud Jalili, Seyyed Ali Aghamiri and Yasar Balaghi carried out a yearslong hacking effort and were involved in a hack and leak operation against former president Donald Trump\u2019s campaign this summer.\n\nThe Treasury Department on Friday also levied sanctions on several IRGC members, including Jalili.\n\nThe recent hacking activity, which first surfaced in early August, was initially attributed to Tehran, after the campaign flagged a Microsoft report released on Aug. 8 that found, in part, that hackers \u201csent a spear-phishing email to a high-ranking official of a presidential campaign from a compromised email account of a former senior advisor.\u201d\n\nThe disclosures came after an individual reached out to at least three major news outlets offering to provide reporters with obtained internal campaign documents, including a vetting dossier on Trump running mate JD Vance, a Republican senator for Ohio.\n\nThe activity first began in May this year, the U.S. alleges. The indictment also references a recently-disclosed attempt by Iran to transmit non-public materials from the Trump campaign to people associated with President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign during his now-ended run for reelection.\n\nThe Tehran-backed hackers are said to have used various tools and techniques to gain unauthorized access to protected U.S. computers, including static IP addresses from Iranian companies, VPNs to hide their location and spoofed login pages. They used social engineering, malware and cloud services to compromise accounts, and in some cases, maintained long-term access to these accounts, the charges say.\n\nIran\u2019s foreign ministry did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\n\u201cYou and your hackers can\u2019t hide behind your keyboards. If you try to meddle in our elections, we\u2019re going to hold you accountable,\u201d FBI Director Chris Wray said in a video announcing the charges. \u201cIf you try to attack our infrastructure or commit violence against our citizens, we\u2019re going to disrupt you. And as long as you keep attempting to flout the rule of law, you\u2019re going to keep running into the FBI.\u201d\n\nNews outlets have largely chosen not to publish the leaked Trump campaign dossier, citing a lack of news and the desire to not repeat patterns exhibited by the media industry when Russian operatives hacked and leaked documents from Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign. Independent journalist Ken Klippenstein published the 271-page document this week on the Subtack platform. His account on X (formerly Twitter) was suspended after promoting links to the document.\n\nIntelligence agencies say Iran, Russia and China are the three leading countries involved in U.S. election meddling this year. Russia has been tabbed by US authorities as the leading player in these efforts, which have involved state-run media accounts and disinformation operations.\n\nEarlier this month, the U.S. accused Russia of running a multi-pronged campaign that targeted U.S. voters ahead of November\u2019s presidential election, unveiling a slew of criminal charges, sanctions and the seizure of several internet domains to push back against the efforts.\n\nThe Trump presidency in 2017 became the center of controversy when the Justice Department launched an investigation into whether Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election. Special Counsel Robert Mueller later determined Trump and his allies had encouraged the hack but that there was insufficient evidence to bring criminal charges against the former president.",

        "text": "U.S. government unveils charges against Iranians who hacked into Trump 2024 campaign \u2022 SC Daily Gazette\nWASHINGTON \u2014 U.S. law enforcement on Friday announced charges against three Iranians who allegedly stole materials from former President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign and tried to pass them to news media and Democrats in an attempt to influence the 2024 election.\n\nThe Department of Justice unsealed the indictment detailing a yearslong hacking scheme by Iran that targeted the email accounts of U.S. government officials, journalists, think tank experts, and most recently the 2024 presidential campaigns.\n\n\u201cThe defendants\u2019 own words make clear that they were attempting to undermine former President Trump\u2019s campaign in advance of the 2024 U.S. presidential election,\u201d Attorney General Merrick Garland said at a Friday press conference.\n\nProsecutors believe the defendants acted from Iran and were never in the U.S.\n\n\u201cWe know that Iran is continuing its brazen efforts to stoke discord, erode confidence in the U.S. electoral process and advance its malign activities for the (Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps), a designated foreign terrorist organization,\u201d Garland said.\n\nThe unsealed indictment in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia came three days after Trump\u2019s campaign revealed the former president was briefed by the U.S. intelligence officials about \u201creal and specific threats from Iran to assassinate him,\u201d according to a statement Tuesday from Steven Cheung, the campaign\u2019s communications director.\n\n\u201cBig threats on my life by Iran,\u201d Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, posted on X Wednesday. Trump suggested at a campaign stop in Mint Hill, North Carolina, that Iran could be responsible for two assassination attempts on him.\n\nThe U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence has not published a statement on the matter. Its most recent press release focuses on the Iranian plot to hack Trump\u2019s campaign.\n\n\u2018It takes two to tango\u2019\n\nGlobal politics continued to top the U.S. presidential election headlines Friday when Trump welcomed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to Trump Tower after announcing the invitation late Thursday at a meandering press conference where he promised, if elected, to strike a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia \u201cquite quickly.\u201d\n\nThe pair met behind closed doors in Trump\u2019s New York City skyscraper on the sidelines of this week\u2019s United Nations General Assembly, and one day after Zelenskyy traveled to Washington to meet with Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, President Joe Biden and bipartisan lawmakers.\n\n\u201cAfter November we have to decide, and we hope that the strengths of the United States will be very strong, and we count on it. That\u2019s why I decided to meet with both candidates,\u201d Zelenskyy said during brief joint comments alongside Trump ahead of the meeting.\n\nTrump, who refused during a live presidential debate to say whether he wanted Ukraine to win its war with Russia, detoured from that stance and hinted Friday that he wants a victory for the Western ally.\n\n\u201cI think the fact that we\u2019re even together today is a very good sign, and hopefully we\u2019ll have a good victory, because (if) the other side wins, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re gonna have victories with anything to be honest with you,\u201d Trump said during the joint remarks.\n\nDuring the exchange, Trump highlighted his \u201cvery good relationship\u201d with Putin and said he could settle the war \u201cvery quickly.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you know, it takes two to tango,\u201d he said.\n\nHarris at the border\n\nHarris traveled to the U.S. southern border Friday to stump for a bipartisan border security deal that collapsed in early 2024 shortly after Trump publicly lambasted it.\n\nHarris delivered what her campaign billed as a major speech in the border town of Douglas, Arizona.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump cares more about self-interest than solutions. He wants a problem to run on, not a fix for the American people,\u201d Harris campaign spokesperson Ammar Moussa said in a statement Friday.\n\nTrump is attacking Harris over border crossings into the U.S. \u2014 his central campaign issue \u2014 and calling her by the dishonest nickname \u201cborder czar\u201d and claiming she caused the \u201cworst border crisis in the history of the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the four years that have taken place after being named \u2018border czar,\u2019 Kamala Harris will be visiting the southern border that she has completely destroyed,\u201d Trump said at his Thursday press conference.\n\nBiden, in February 2021, tasked Harris with strategizing ways to fight the \u201croot cause\u201d of migration from Central American countries, including economic insecurity, government corruption and gender-based violence.\n\nTrump has historically painted with a broad brush the complex issue of immigration at the U.S. southern border, announcing his first presidential campaign in 2015 by describing Mexican immigrants as \u201crapists.\u201d During his own presidency in 2018 he warned of immigrant \u201ccaravans\u201d crossing into the U.S. from Mexico. He has promised mass deportations if elected in November.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security publicly releases numbers of border encounters, apprehensions and expulsions.\n\nThe number of unlawful border crossings hit a record-breaking high in December 2023, with nearly 302,000 recorded encounters that month along the U.S.-Mexico border. Border encounters fell to 104,100 in July, the lowest monthly tally since shortly after Biden took office. There were 72,100 encounters in November 2020, the month he was elected.",

Erica Dischino/Reuters/File\n\nTim Walz is telling people he\u2019s just as nervous about facing JD Vance as he was the Sunday afternoon in August when he warned Kamala Harris in his running mate interview that he was a bad debater.\n\nMaybe more nervous, according to multiple people who\u2019ve spoken to him.\n\nAnd the pressure is even higher, when for the first time in modern campaign history, the vice presidential debate Tuesday is likely to be the last marquee event before Election Day. With many voters still saying they don\u2019t know enough about Harris, it could be up to Walz to help convince them to trust a vice president he barely knew himself before she picked him.\n\nTalking to the aides who have coalesced around him in Minnesota, Walz constantly comes back to how worried he is about letting Harris down, according to close to a dozen top campaign staffers and others who have been in touch with the governor and his team. He doesn\u2019t want Donald Trump to win. He doesn\u2019t want Harris to think she made the wrong choice.\n\nHe feels genuine contempt for and confusion over what he views as Vance\u2019s abandonment of their common roots, and for flipping so many of his positions to fit with Trump. The digs he takes at Vance by saying he didn\u2019t know many Midwesterners who went to Yale are a glimpse into his anxiety that his opponent learned to be a sharp debater there, according to people who know Walz.\n\nWalz\u2019s debate strategy: The plan for Tuesday night, several people involved told CNN, will be to largely skip Vance and go right at Trump \u2014 but to also squeeze the Ohio senator between his attempts to appeal to undecided voters.\n\nRead more here.",

And it should be in effect today, producing results in real time, right now, for our country,\u201d she said at a rally in Douglas, a town on the US-Mexico border.\n\nTrump responded to Harris\u2019 speech and argued the remarks were \u201ctoo late!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t Kamala make this speech four years ago? It\u2019s too late! She has damaged our Country beyond recognition. There is no excuse for what she has done. She is guilty of CRIMES! Now she is begging for forgiveness, but our Country will never forgive her for this GROSS INCOMPETENCE at the Border. ONLY I CAN FIX IT.

And I will partner with Democrats, Republicans, and Independents to do it.\u201d\n\nVance\u2019s response: \u201cThat\u2019s cool but can you just do it now?

The new poll highlighted a fresh trend in the US presidential election, starkly contrasting public opinion weeks ago.\n\nDonald Trump has an advantage over strength on economic issues Despite Kamala Harris's promising performance in the debate, which helped her gain popularity in such a short time, she is lagging behind Donald Trump among voters mindful of economic issues in Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin.\n\nThe polls indicated Trump's enduring strength on economic issues. In Michigan, it will be a neck-and-neck race, as the New York Post report indicated polls showing 48% support for Harris and 47% support for Trump. However, the percentage can be changed subject to the poll's margin of error.\n\nKey issues among US voters Economic issues, abortion rights, and the attack on the US Capitol were some of the key issues voters considered when choosing their Presidential candidate.

A few voters told NYP that they were not supporters of Kamala Harris but would vote for her to stop Trump.",

        "summary": " Democrat Kamala Harris leads Republican Donald Trump by 49.3\u201346.0 \u2013 a slight widening of the competition since last Monday . The US president isn\u2019t elected by the national popular vote, but by the Electoral College, in which each state receives electoral votes equal to its federal House seats (population based) and senators (always two) It takes 270 electoral votes to win (out of 538 total)",
        "text": "Kamala Harris the slight favourite to win US election as she narrowly leads in key states\nThe US presidential election will be held on November 5. In analyst Nate Silver\u2019s aggregate of national polls, Democrat Kamala Harris leads Republican Donald Trump by 49.3\u201346.0 \u2013 a slight widening of the competition since last Monday, when Harris led Trump by 49.2\u201346.2.\n\nPresident Joe Biden\u2019s final position before his withdrawal as Democratic candidate on July 21 was a national poll deficit against Trump of 45.2\u201341.2.\n\nThere will be a debate on Tuesday evening US time between the vice-presidential candidates, Democrat Tim Walz and Republican JD Vance. Vice-presidential debates in previous elections have not had a significant influence on the contest.\n\nThe US president isn\u2019t elected by the national popular vote, but by the Electoral College, in which each state receives electoral votes equal to its federal House seats (population based) and senators (always two). Almost all states award their electoral votes as winner-takes-all, and it takes 270 electoral votes to win (out of 538 total).\n\nThe Electoral College is biased to Trump relative to the national popular vote, with Harris needing at least a two-point popular vote win in Silver\u2019s model to be the Electoral College favourite.\n\nIn Silver\u2019s polling averages, Harris leads Trump by one to two points in Pennsylvania (19 electoral votes), Michigan (15), Wisconsin (ten) and Nevada (six). If Harris wins all these states, she is likely to win the Electoral College by at least a 276\u2013262 margin. Trump is ahead by less than a point in North Carolina (16 electoral votes) and Georgia (16), and if Harris wins both, she wins by 308\u2013230.\n\nIn Silver\u2019s model, Harris has a 56% chance to win the Electoral College, up from 54% last Monday but down from her peak of 58% two days ago. Earlier this month, there were large differences in win probability between Silver\u2019s model and the FiveThirtyEight model, which was more favourable to Harris. But these models have nearly converged, with FiveThirtyEight now giving Harris a 59% win probability.\n\nThere are still more than five weeks until election day, so polls could change in either Trump\u2019s or Harris\u2019 favour by then. Harris\u2019 one to two point leads in the key states are tenuous, and this explains why Trump is still rated a good chance to win.\n\nSilver wrote on September 1 that polls in 2020 and 2016 were biased against Trump, but polls in 2012 were biased against Barack Obama. In the last two midterm elections (2022 and 2018), polls have been good. It\u2019s plausible there will be a polling error this year, but which candidate such an error would favour can\u2019t be predicted.\n\nOn Sunday, Silver said if there was a systematic error of three or four points in the polls in either Trump\u2019s or Harris\u2019 favour, that candidate would sweep all the swing states and easily win the Electoral College. There are other scenarios in which one candidate underperforms the polls with some demographics but overperforms with other demographics.\n\nI wrote about the US election for The Poll Bludger last Thursday, and also covered bleak polls and byelection results in Canada for the governing centre-left Liberals ahead of an election due by October 2025, a dreadful poll for UK Labour Prime Minister Keir Starmer, the new French prime minister, a German state election and a socialist win in Sri Lanka\u2019s presidential election.\n\nUpwardly revised economic data\n\nLast Thursday, a revised estimate of June quarter US GDP was released. There was a large upward revision in real disposable personal income compared to the previously reported figures. This has resulted in the personal savings rate being revised up to 4.9% in July from the previously reported 2.9%, and it was 4.8% in August.\n\nWith these upward revisions, Silver\u2019s economic index that averages six indicators is now at +0.25, up from +0.09. As the incumbent party\u2019s candidate, a better economy than was previously believed should help Harris.\n\nCoalition gains narrow lead in Essential\n\nIn Australia, a national Essential poll, conducted on September 18\u201322 from a sample of 1,117 people, gave the Coalition a 48\u201347 lead (including undecided voters) after a 48\u201348 tie in early September. It\u2019s the Coalition\u2019s first lead in the Essential poll since mid-July.\n\nPrimary votes were 35% Coalition (steady), 29% Labor (down one), 12% Greens (down one), 8% One Nation (steady), 2% UAP (up one), 9% for all Others (up one) and 5% undecided (steady).\n\nAnthony Albanese\u2019s net approval was up five points since August to \u20135, with 47% disapproving and 42% approving. Peter Dutton\u2019s net approval was down one to net zero.\n\nOn social media regulations, 48% thought them too weak, 43% about right and 8% too tough. By 67\u201317, voters supported imposing an age limit for children to access social media (68\u201315 in July). By 71\u201312, voters supported making doxing (the public release of personally identifiable data) a criminal offence (62\u201319 in February).\n\nBy 49\u201318, voters supported Labor\u2019s Help to Buy scheme, and by 57\u201313 they supported the build-to-rent scheme. The questions give detail that few voters would know.\n\nVoters were told the Liberals and Greens had combined to delay Labor\u2019s housing policies in the senate. By 48\u201322, voters thought the Liberals and Greens should pass the policies and argue for their own policies at the next election, rather than block Labor\u2019s policies. Greens voters supported passing by 55\u201321.\n\nLabor keeps narrow lead in Morgan\n\nA national Morgan poll, conducted September 16\u201322 from a sample of 1,662 people, gave Labor a 50.5\u201349.5 lead, unchanged from the September 9\u201315 Morgan poll.\n\nPrimary votes were 37.5% Coalition (steady), 32% Labor (up 1.5), 12.5% Greens (steady), 5% One Nation (down 0.5), 9.5% independents (down 0.5) and 3.5% others (down 0.5).\n\nThe headline figure is based on respondent preferences. By 2022 election preference flows, Labor led by an unchanged 52\u201348.",

        "text": "Where Trump and Harris stand on immigration and border security\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Immigration is one of the key issues in the November election, with many voters concerned over the numbers of migrants who have entered the U.S. during the Biden administration.\n\nRepublicans have repeatedly hammered President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris on the issue and painted a picture of an out-of-control immigration system where migrants are straining services as would-be terrorists and criminals take advantage of the chaos to infiltrate the country.\n\nAfter coming into office promising a kinder approach to immigration, Biden administration officials found themselves struggling to control the southern border. They have cracked down on asylum access but also created new ways for migrants to come to America and for some of those already here to become citizens.\n\nThe administration has pointed to the falling numbers of migrants coming to the border this summer as proof its policies are working.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at where Harris and Trump stand on immigration:\n\nHarris focuses on border security\n\nDuring her first trip to the border as the Democratic presidential nominee on Friday, Harris outlined a plan to crack down further on asylum claims and extend restrictions put in place earlier this summer by the Biden administration on asylum access.\n\nBefore this trip, Harris has largely shied away from the topic of immigration and has given few details about what she would do if elected. That\u2019s a reflection of how the issue has become such a controversial topic for the Biden administration.\n\nWhile Biden promised during the 2020 campaign to restore America\u2019s place as a refuge for people fleeing persecution, the administration swiftly found itself dealing with ever-increasing numbers of migrants at the southern border. Democratic-led cities rebelled at the strain migrants were taking on their cities.\n\nThe administration shifted to a more carrot-and-stick approach that made it harder for people who come to the border to get asylum while also creating new pathways designed to make the process more orderly.\n\nIn public comments and on her website, Harris has focused on ways she would enforce border security and crack down on drug smuggling.\n\nThe vice president has talked up her experience as California attorney general, saying she walked drug smuggler tunnels and successfully prosecuted gangs that moved narcotics and people across the border.\n\nEarly in his term, Biden made Harris his administration\u2019s point person on the root causes of migration. Republicans have described it as a \u201cborder czar\u201d position responsible for all border security, but her job was specific \u2014 figuring out long-term ways to stem migration from three countries in Central America. During a trip to Guatemala, she warned migrants thinking of coming to America: \u201cDo not come.\u201d\n\nHarris has said Trump worsened the situation at the border by killing a bipartisan Senate compromise earlier this year that would have included toughening asylum standards and hiring more border agents, immigration judges and asylum officers. She said she would bring back that bill and sign it into law.\n\nAfter hitting a record high in December 2023, the numbers of migrants crossing the border has plummeted since then. Harris and the administration have credited their tough anti-asylum measures for stemming the flow, although increased enforcement on the Mexican side has also played a key role.\n\nThe vice president has endorsed comprehensive immigration reform, seeking pathways to citizenship for immigrants in the U.S. without legal status, with a faster track for people living in the country illegally who arrived as children.\n\nShe hasn\u2019t weighed in on whether she would continue key Biden administration programs that have allowed more than a million migrants to enter the country \u2014 the carrot of the carrot-and-stick approach.\n\nMigrants can use an app called CBP One to schedule an appointment while they\u2019re in Mexico to present themselves at an official border crossing for entry. Also, 30,000 migrants a month from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela can come to America for two years and get a work permit, assuming they have a financial sponsor, pass vetting and fly into an American airport.\n\nHarris also has lashed out at Trump\u2019s zero-tolerance policies that separated families at the border to try to deter immigration.\n\nTrump vows mass deportations\n\nImmigration was the issue that propelled Trump into the White House the first time and what he hopes will give him another term.\n\nDuring just about every campaign speech or appearance, he has portrayed immigration as out of control.\n\nOne of Trump\u2019s key promises if reelected is to mount the largest domestic deportation in U.S. history. He made similar promises when he first ran for office, but during his administration, deportations never topped 350,000.\n\nFor comparison, then-President Barack Obama carried out 432,000 deportations in 2013, the highest annual total since records were kept.\n\nThis time, Trump has given some more specifics on his promises. He said he\u2019ll use the National Guard to round up migrants. And he said he would invoke the Alien Enemies Act, a 1798 law that allows the president to deport any noncitizen from a country that the U.S. is at war with.\n\nHe\u2019s also vowed to kick out hundreds of thousands of immigrants who have entered the country under two key Biden administration programs if he\u2019s reelected.\n\nAny mass deportation plans would certainly be challenged in court and be enormously expensive to carry out. And it would depend on countries being willing to take back their citizens.\n\nTrump says he also would bring back policies he put in place during his first term, like the Remain in Mexico program and Title 42. Remain in Mexico made migrants wait in Mexico while their asylum cases were heard, while Title 42 curbed immigration on public health grounds.\n\nHe has said he\u2019ll revive and expand a travel ban from his term that originally targeted citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries and pledged new \u201cideological screening\u201d for immigrants to bar \u201cdangerous lunatics, haters, bigots and maniacs.\u201d\n\nTrump also seeks to end birthright citizenship for people born in the U.S. whose parents are both in the country illegally.",

        "text": "U.S. Presidential Election 2024: Donald Trump's outreach to Catholics\n\u201cSaint Michael the Archangel, defend us in battle. Be our defense against the wickedness and snares of the devil.\u201d This prayer to Saint Michael, introduced into the Roman liturgy by Pope Leo XIII, used for the conversion of Russia by Pope Pius XI, encouraged by Pope John Paul II, and recited daily by Pope Francis, was repeated by millions of Catholics worldwide September 29 for the feast of the archangel who defeated the dragon.\n\nOne stood out among all the messages posted on social media for the occasion. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), former U.S. President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who comes from a Presbyterian Protestant family, shared this Catholic prayer despite his voter base being primarily made up of evangelical Protestants\u2014who do not pray to saints.\n\nSaint Michael the Archangel, defend us in battle. Be our defense against the wickedness and snares of the Devil. May God rebuke him, we humbly pray, and do thou, O Prince of the heavenly hosts, by the power of God, cast into hell Satan, and all the evil spirits, who prowl about\u2026 pic.twitter.com/Z3RoeGUslh \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 30, 2024\n\nElectoral strategy\n\nThis is not the first time the 45th U.S. president has used Catholic imagery. On September 8, for the Nativity of the Virgin Mary, Trump posted an image of Our Lady of Guadalupe, who appeared to an indigenous person in Mexico in 1531, with the message \u201cHappy Birthday Mary!\u201d This gesture sparked curiosity and sometimes disapproval from many evangelical Christians in the United States.\n\nCatholicism and threats to American democracy in the 2024 elections Further reading:\n\nIn a campaign where faith and religion have been less prominent than in the previous election, Trump has made several gestures toward American Catholics. At the beginning of September, the former president launched an initiative called \u201cCatholics for Trump,\u201d highlighting his record on religious freedom.\n\nIn 2020, the Catholic vote was crucial in helping President Joe Biden win the White House. \u201cWith these communication campaigns, Trump is targeting young elites and American right-wing leaders, who are increasingly Catholic,\u201d says Paul Carpenter, a religious studies researcher at the \u00c9cole Pratique des Hautes \u00c9tudes. The former president is not targeting all American Catholics, as faith-based divides are not a deciding factor for many voters who prioritize economic issues.\n\nThrough these posts, the Republican candidate may also be trying to regain favor with conservative anti-abortion voters after expressing opposition to a federal abortion ban. \u201cPro-life organizations are very influential among elites and major donors,\u201d Carpenter explained. \u201cTheir reaction to Trump's stance was more intense than expected, causing some to withdraw support from his campaign. The social media images and posts are purely symbolic. It shows that his team is aware that a segment of the Republican Party is dissatisfied with the candidate\u2019s positions. By making such gestures, Trump is trying to ease internal tensions.\u201d\n\nAppealing to Catholic voters\n\nThe gesture comes at a time when the Catholic electorate is divided. According to a poll published by the Pew Research Center September 9, the former president narrowly leads his Democratic rival Kamala Harris (52% of voting intentions versus 47% for her). \u201cThis shows that Donald Trump has closed the small gap that allowed current President Joe Biden to win in 2020\u201d with 51% of the Catholic vote, says Marie Gayte, an associate professor of American civilization at the University of Toulon.\n\nThe study also shows stronger Republican voting intentions among white Catholics, with 61% favoring Republicans versus 38% for Democrats. \u201cTrump also leads among regular churchgoers,\u201d the researcher added. However, the Hispanic Catholic vote largely favors Kamala Harris (65%), whereas before his withdrawal from the Democratic primary, Joe Biden had struggled with this electorate.",

        "text": "Harris stretches lead over Trump in what could be significant increase\nKamala Harris has stretched her lead over Donald Trump in the US presidential election race, the latest polling averages show, even while the two candidates appear to be running neck-and-neck in most battleground states.\n\nThe Guardian\u2019s newest poll tracker, based on a range of surveys conducted across a 10-day period, shows the vice-president and Democratic nominee at 48.2%, compared with 44.4% for Trump, the Republican candidate and former president \u2013 giving Harris a 3.8-point advantage.\n\nThat\u2019s one point up from the lead she held a week ago and broadly consistent with most \u2013 though not all \u2013 recent survey findings.\n\nTo put it in perspective, the polling analysis website 538, also known as Five Thirty Eight, gave Harris a 2.9-point advantage on Friday morning, smaller than the Guardian\u2019s advantage but within range. The site translated that into Harris having a 58% chance of winning November\u2019s election, against 42% for Trump.\n\nThe caveat with national polls is that the election outcome is almost certain to be decided by who wins certain key swing states under America\u2019s electoral college system.\n\nNevertheless, the fact that Harris\u2019s national poll lead may be increasing \u2013 even by small margins \u2013 may turn out to be significant.\n\nPolling suggests that Harris is likely to win the popular vote \u2013 Democratic candidates have done so in five out of the past six presidential elections in the 21st century, yet Republicans eked out a victory in two of those contests.\n\nThe first was in 2000, when George W Bush edged out Al Gore \u2013 despite losing the nationwide tally by around 540,000 votes \u2013 after a weeks-long court battle to decide who had won Florida, where thousands of ballots were disputed.\n\nMore recently, Trump triumphed in the electoral college in 2016 thanks to wafer-thin victory margins in the three blue-wall states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin despite gaining about 2.7m fewer votes than Hillary Clinton across the nation.\n\nThe prospects of a repeat 2016 scenario are a recurring nightmare in the minds of many Democrats.\n\nHowever, Harry Enten, CNN\u2019s data analyst, painted a rosier outlook for Harris stemming from her range of national poll leads. Although his own network\u2019s latest survey gave her only a narrow, one-point advantage, Enten acknowledged that other polls reflected a bigger lead, some as large as six points.\n\n\u201cWe talk about these national polls, but the bottom line is, it\u2019s a race to 270 [electoral college votes],\u201d he said. \u201cOne way you can kind of get at this is: [what are] Harris\u2019s chances, given a popular vote margin? And what\u2019s the chance you win the electoral college?\u201d\n\nContinuing the theme, Enten argued that Trump would have an electoral college advantage if the national vote were tallied with the CNN poll that gave Harris a single-point lead \u2013 but that this would disappear if she were to win the national vote by a wider margin as suggested by other polls and reflected in the Guardian tracker.\n\n\u201cIf you model it out, and we sort of get where that CNN poll is \u2013 plus one \u2013 I think Donald Trump would be favoured in the electoral college. Harris would just have a 33% chance of winning,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you get closer to where the average poll is, a plus-two to plus-three margin, then Harris is a slight favourite in the electoral college.\u201d\n\nThe longstanding assumption underpinning that argument \u2013 common to pollsters and political partisans alike and reinforced by Trump\u2019s 2016 winning-while-losing feat \u2013 is that Republicans have a natural advantage in the electoral college, meaning that a Democratic candidate needs to win the popular vote by a significant margin to be sure of securing the 270 electoral votes essential for victory.\n\nNate Cohn, the New York Times\u2019 chief poll analyst, argued that there was evidence that this GOP advantage was being eroded.\n\nCohn detected the trend, counterintuitively, in a New York Times/Siena poll that showed Harris and Trump tied nationally at 47% \u2013 while the Democratic nominee is leading by an impressive four points in Pennsylvania, arguably the most important swing state of all.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s growing evidence to support a surprising possibility: [Trump\u2019s] once formidable advantage in the electoral college is not as ironclad as many presumed. Instead, it might be shrinking,\u201d Cohn argued.\n\nHe went on: \u201cAccording to the New York Times\u2019 polling average, it does not seem that Kamala Harris will necessarily need to win the popular vote by much to prevail.\u201d\n\nThe reason, roughly summarised, is that while Harris is sustaining narrow leads in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin \u2013 three states that would be enough to get the vice-president to the coveted 270 electoral votes \u2013 Trump is polling better than four years ago in states he still has little chance of winning.\n\n\u201cOn the one hand, Ms Harris is holding her own in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania,\u201d Cohn wrote, while cautioning that her lead was \u201ctenuous\u201d. \u201cThe second half of the explanation, oddly, is that Mr Trump is gaining in non-competitive states like New York, improving his position in the national popular vote without helping him in the most important states.\u201d\n\nWith just over five weeks to go before polling day, none of this is predictive of a final outcome. But it may just suggest a scenario where the candidate destined for the White House is the one who wins the most votes \u2013 which, after all, is how democracy is meant to work.",

In Madrid, Gonzalez Urrutia greeted supporters who were waving the Venezuelan flag.\n\nMeanwhile, hundreds of Maduro supporters marched in Caracas to proclaim victory in the election.\n\nMaduro told the crowd the \"supposed queen bee,\" in reference to Machado, \"is beginning to pack her Gucci suitcases ... she is preparing to leave, too.\"\n\n\"We are not in Madrid, we are not hiding, we are in the street,\" he declared.\n\nOn Thursday, about 30 countries led by the United States and Argentina urged Maduro to engage in dialogue with the opposition.\n\nIn a joint statement, the countries called for \"constructive and inclusive discussions\" on a democratic transition and to immediately release Venezuelans detained in the election aftermath.",

        "text": "American expats in Hong Kong could swing the US election\nIf the US national elections on November 5 go smoothly, not long thereafter we will know whether Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris or Republican former president Donald Trump will be the nation\u2019s next leader. The result could make the difference between a relatively stable and prosperous future, not just for the United States, and a path to decline and insecurity at home and abroad.\n\nThe US, Chinese flag and Hong Kong flag. File photo: Tom Grundy/HKFP.\n\nAmerican expatriates in Hong Kong have the potential to influence who moves into the White House. They could also determine which party \u2014 centre-left Democrats or populist right-wing Republicans \u2014 will control the US Senate and House of Representatives.\n\nAbout 70,000 US citizens live in Hong Kong and many of them were born here or in mainland China. The number has fallen by about 15,000 in recent years, reportedly driven by Covid and new national security-related laws.\n\nIt is difficult to know how many Americans in Hong Kong will vote in the elections. Fewer than one in ten American expats around the world normally do so. Some Americans here are too young to vote, and many others might not take their civic duty very seriously \u2014 much like millions of their compatriots in the US. Nevertheless, it seems reasonable to assume that many thousands of Americans in Hong Kong are both eligible and willing to vote.\n\nAmerican expats here may be inclined to assume that their number is too small to make a difference. Such an assumption would ignore recent history. Because the US is so evenly divided between left and right, presidential elections can be decided by very narrow margins.\n\nFor example, in the 2000 presidential election, Republican George W. Bush defeated Democrat Al Gore after winning the state of Florida by only a few hundred votes. Bush did so despite garnering over half a million fewer votes nationally. This was possible due to the US\u2019s undemocratic Electoral College system, which allocates delegates \u2013 who formally elect the president \u2013 in a way that gives small states disproportionate power.\n\nGeorge W. Bush. Photo: Wikicommons.\n\nMost states are not electorally competitive. California will definitely choose Harris; Idaho will definitely choose Trump. To take the White House, the victorious candidate must win in several battleground \u201cswing\u201d states \u2013 those that sometimes prefer Democrats and sometimes Republicans \u2013 such as Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, so as to add to their Electoral College tally. Harris is all but certain to receive the most votes nationally, but Trump could nevertheless regain power if he prevails in several battleground states.\n\nAbout 1.6 million Americans from seven of those states are currently living abroad. According to reporting by National Public Radio, their votes in next month\u2019s election \u201ccould easily be the deciding factor\u201d in determining who becomes president.\n\nIt is not difficult for American expats to vote in national elections. Rules for voter registration vary by state, but most expats should be able to register by sending a federal registration form to the clerk of their last voting residence. The NGO votefromabroad.org has a step-by-step guide for requesting an absentee ballot. Expats whose ballots don\u2019t arrive can submit a Federal Write-in Absentee Ballot.\n\nExpats need to do this without delay so that their marked ballots arrive by November 5. If they are voting in jurisdictions controlled by Republicans, it\u2019s especially vital that they follow all the rules. Republicans are actively working to restrict the counting of absentee ballots.\n\nA ballot paper. File photo: Wikicommons.\n\nOnce American expats receive their ballots, the question becomes whom they should vote for. Patriotism can be a guide. American patriots will be inclined to vote for the candidate that they think will best promote the long-term interests of the United States, provide for national defence, ensure national economic well-being and protect the American way of life, most fundamentally freedom and democracy.\n\nImportantly, to vote as a patriotic American does not preclude voting for candidates that might also promote the well-being of people around the world. That\u2019s because what is good for the United States can also be good for other countries, and vice-versa.\n\nFor American patriots, Harris is the obvious pick. On the economy, she would likely build on the successes of outgoing President Joe Biden\u2019s administration, focusing on concrete measures to encourage economic growth alongside policies that incentivise domestic investment, improve infrastructure, expand industries of the future, increase the number of quality jobs, improve worker rights and invest in education.\n\nHarris would likely continue Biden\u2019s efforts to rationally bolster national security capabilities while promoting multilateral cooperation among allied countries, particularly in Europe and East Asia. She would continue assisting Ukraine, and with time she may come to realise that much greater assistance \u2014 enough to persuade Russian President Vladimir Putin to relent \u2014 is in the interests of the US and the world.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin. File photo: Russian MFA.\n\nOn the environment, Harris would not work miracles, but she is likely to use the executive branch to limit harm to the environment and continue slow progress toward weaning Americans off fossil fuels. Vitally, Harris is likely to respect constitutional democracy and the rule of law. She would encourage greater voter participation, in contrast to Trump\u2019s efforts to restrict it.\n\nCompared to Trump, Harris would be relatively good for China and its people, albeit relatively bad for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). No doubt she would continue the Biden administration\u2019s trend of confronting Beijing on trade, regional security and human rights. She is likely to reaffirm American promises to aid Taiwan if it is threatened with invasion. All of this would be a good for China if it prevents overreach by Beijing that would bring hardship to the region.\n\nFor those American expats in Hong Kong who love China, want what is best for its people, and hope to see a prosperous and peaceful East Asia \u2013 one assumes that this is the case with most of them \u2013 Harris is the right choice for president. Things become more complicated if any Americans in Hong Kong consider themselves to be what the local government calls Chinese \u201cpatriots.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s because to be a so-called Chinese \u201cpatriot\u201d in Hong Kong, at least if one comports with what is reported to be the official definition of patriotism here, it seems that one must love the CCP and its leadership. While being a patriot in the US allows one to detest the party in power and even seek its removal, a Chinese \u201cpatriot\u201d \u2013 or indeed anyone \u2013 expressing such a sentiment openly, no matter how much they love China, may end up in jail.\n\nBecause Harris is the most credible candidate to stand up to the CCP, any American expats in Hong Kong who are so-called Chinese \u201cpatriots\u201d are unlikely to vote for her. They will logically vote for the candidate who will weaken the US: Trump.\n\nKamala Harris. Photo: The White House/Adam Schultz, via Flickr.\n\nIf Trump were able to implement many of his economic preferences, the US economy would suffer enormously. The imposition of widespread tariffs on both competitors and friends would lead to inflation and trade conflicts. His plan to end the independence of the Federal Reserve would make interest rates a political tool instead of a means to stabilise prices and promote full employment. Tax cuts for the rich would bankrupt key federal programmes while greatly increasing national debt.\n\nA Trump presidency would be a disaster for US and global security. Trump seems hellbent on abandoning Ukraine to Russian aggression and reducing US support for NATO. He would probably threaten Japan and the Philippines with tariffs instead of reinforcing their cooperation in the face of Chinese aggression. As in his first administration, he would undermine efforts to limit nuclear proliferation, notably in Iran and North Korea.\n\nTrump has promised to build on his past efforts to gut environmental protections and give polluting industries free rein to exploit nature. A vote for Trump would extend the US obsession with fossil fuels and cement China\u2019s leadership in key environmental technologies, including electric cars, batteries and solar panels. He would once again withdraw the US from the Paris climate agreement.\n\nTrump would very likely use the powers of the presidency to go after his perceived enemies, to weaken voting rights and protections for minorities, pardon felons who assisted his attempt to overturn the last election, appoint more unqualified federal judges and even commit crimes now that the Supreme Court has ruled that he would be all but immune from prosecution.\n\nDonald Trump. Photo: The White House, via Flickr.\n\nOn China, Trump would be a thorn in the side of Beijing in the short term. But by undermining the US economy, trade relationships and alliances, and by emboldening Russia and other autocrats, in the long term the objectives of China\u2019s leaders to undermine and eventually replace the US-led international order would be much advanced.\n\nRussia is very actively trying to swing the US election in Trump\u2019s favour. If Beijing\u2019s interests are aligned with Moscow\u2019s, as Chinese officials seem to believe, then they, too, will want Trump to win. The real benefit for the CCP will come in the years and decades to come as a US weakened by Trumpist Republicans allows the mantle of global leadership to pass to the CCP.\n\nDiffering notions of patriotism \u2014 one patriotism that wants what\u2019s best for the US and the world, including China, and another so-called patriotism that must want what the CCP\u2019s leadership wants \u2013 inform how American expats in Hong Kong might vote. American patriots should vote for Harris. She\u2019ll be the best for the United States and its people, for China and its people, and for people elsewhere.\n\nIn contrast, if there are any American expats who consider themselves to be so-called Chinese \u201cpatriots,\u201d they may vote for Trump because he\u2019ll inadvertently help the CCP and its leadership, even while he\u2019ll be bad for the people of the United States, China and the wider world.\n\nType of Story: Opinion Advocates for ideas and draws conclusions based on the interpretation of facts and data.\n\nSupport HKFP | Policies & Ethics | Error/typo? | Contact Us | Newsletter | Transparency & Annual Report | Apps\n\nHelp safeguard press freedom & keep HKFP free for all readers by supporting our team",

        "text": "NYT writer David Leonhardt talks 2024 elections\nDavid Leonhardt, New York Times writer and Jackson School senior fellow, discussed the final weeks of the 2024 presidential election with Jackson School Dean James Levinsohn.\n\nSamantha Warfel, Contributing Photographer\n\nOn Thursday, New York Times writer and Jackson School senior fellow David Leonhardt \u201994 spoke at Yale about the U.S. elections.\n\nThe talk was moderated by Jackson School Dean James Levinsohn. The speakers discussed the final few weeks of the 2024 United States presidential election and the role of the media in it.\n\n\u201cYou really should think of [the election] as 50-50,\u201d Leonhardt said, adding that one should not put stock in the polls.\n\nLeondhart said that a unique component of former president Donald Trump\u2019s campaign is his appeal to the working class and burgeoning message that a Republican who prioritizes a vote on the basis of issues not aligned with the economy \u2014 or directly related issues including international trade and immigration \u2014 is failing the party at-large.\n\nIn contrast, Leonhardt said Vice President Kamala Harris \u201cwon\u2019t come close to matching Obama\u2019s [appeal] with working-class Americans of all races.\u201d\n\nRecently, readers of the New York Times were asked to send in their biggest concerns about both candidates. Leondhart said that he read through each response from voters who identified as undecided and those who said they would \u201cprobably\u201d vote for one of the two candidates.\n\nOverwhelmingly, he said, there were concerns about Trump on the basis of personality, as people \u201creally don\u2019t like [him] as a human being.\u201d\n\nSome of the adjectives used to describe him in the responses from readers included \u201cerratic,\u201d \u201cunhinged\u201d and \u201cselfish.\u201d There were fewer complaints about his presidency, even as Leonhardt believes there should have been, referencing his handling of COVID-19 and policies skewed to favor the rich.\n\nFor Harris, the responses varied. Leonhardt, who does believe she has real weaknesses as a politician, was disheartened by a slew of concerns sent in criticizing her intelligence \u2014 something he suspects to be symptoms of sexism and racism.\n\nHe added that multiple people said that when she is asked a question, \u201cshe doesn\u2019t answer it.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost of her complaints were policy issues,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was inflation, it was immigration, it was a whole bunch of people who said \u2018I don\u2019t even know what she thinks.\u2019\u201d\n\nLeonhardt is the lead writer of \u201cThe Morning,\u201d The New York Times\u2019 flagship daily newsletter. One attendee, Ashutosh Bakre SOM \u201926, said that Leonhardt\u2019s \u201cThe Morning\u201d is their newsletter of choice, as his articles \u201ctend to have a level of analytical rigor which was reflected in the way he answered questions, which was measured and clearly not leaning one way or the other.\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes at Yale, we get stuck in these little towers of our own knowledge and our own perspectives,\u201d Naz Soysal \u201926 said. \u201cIt is nice to have someone come speak and remind us that the entire country is not Yale.\u201d\n\nAs the event winded to a close, Leondhart reminded attendees to center this election within international affairs, describing it as a \u201cstruggle between global democracy and autocracy,\u201d as he believes global alliances shift and so does American leadership.\n\nThe Jackson School is located at 55 Hillhouse Ave.",

        "text": "\u2018Every vote counts\u2019: Americans living Israel encouraged to vote in US presidential election\n(JNS) Hundreds of thousands of Americans living in Israel are eligible to vote in November\u2019s U.S. elections, including some in swing states whose votes could prove decisive in a close election, the heads of Democratic and Republican organizations in Israel said Thursday.\n\nThe remarks come amid a cross-party push to get out the absentee vote in Israel in a highly-charged year, punctuated by the fallout of the Oct. 7 Hamas massacre and the nearly year-long war against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, as well as a global surge of antisemitism.\n\n\u201cWhile it is hard to gauge how many Americans in Israel will actually vote, we are seeing a lot of motivation because of what happened on Oct. 7 and its aftermath,\u201d Matanya Harow, national director of the non-partisan iVoteIsrael, told JNS. \u201cThe war has shown what a big influence the United States has on events here.\u201d\n\nJews \u201care among the most consistently liberal and Democratic groups in the U.S. population,\u201d and 70% of U.S. Jewish adults \u201cidentify with or lean toward the Democratic Party, and half describe their political views as liberal,\u201d Pew Research Center surveys suggest.\n\nMarc Zell, chairman of the Republican Overseas Israel, told JNS that he expects 80% to 90% of American Jews in Israel to vote Republican \u201cprimarily because of Oct. 7.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe question is how many of them will vote,\u201d he said. \u201cOur biggest challenge is getting them to vote in a process that is logistically complicated.\u201d\n\nNearly a quarter century after former President George W. Bush won Florida by several hundred votes, the 2024 presidential election is thought to be close to a coin-flip in several swing states.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at elections being decided by several thousand or less votes, every vote counts, which is why we are reaching out especially to voters in swing states this election more so than times past,\u201d Ethan Kushner, chairman of American Democrats in Israel, told JNS. \u201cWe see the same motivations voters had in 2020, with much more vigor.\u201d\n\nMost American Jews living in Israel come from New York, New Jersey and California, which typically vote Democratic, but many also come from swing states, which could determine the outcome of the election.\n\nHarow stressed that voters, who might be disinclined to cast an absentee ballot thinking their vote doesn\u2019t count, have a say in often-tight congressional races. They also have political sway if their representatives are aware that there is a large constituency of voters from their district living in Israel, he said.\n\nZell said that American Jews living in Israel should also vote out of appreciation for what former President Donald Trump has done for Israel during his term in office and, he said, because it could encourage U.S. evangelical Christians to vote if they see that most Americans in Israel vote Republican.\n\n\u201cThe Jewish community in the United States has a severe case of \u2018Trump derangement syndrome,\u2019\u201d Zell told JNS. \u201cIt is not a rational approach but generational political inertia dating back to how their parents and grandparents voted from the Franklin Roosevelt administration.\u201d (Franklin D. Roosevelt was the U.S. president from 1933 to 1945.)\n\n\u201cWith all due respect to the Israeli-American bilateral relations, American voters are voting for American issues not for Israeli issues,\u201d Kushner said. \u201cIsrael is not the lynchpin that will determine the outcome of the elections.\u201d\n\nKushner cited domestic issues that he said are of primary importance to Americans in Israel, including the economy, immigration and abortion. Those issues are foremost on the minds of U.S. voters in Israel now, as they have been in past elections, despite the tumultuous events of the last year in Israel, he said.\n\nHarow, Kushner and Zell encouraged Americans living in Israel to register to vote quickly, as time is running out to mail ballots back to the United States in time to meet state deadlines. After that, voters could submit an absentee ballot, they said.",

The former GOP senator posted on X, saying, \"I\u2019ll be supporting Kamala Harris for President and Tim Walz for Vice President.\"Flake has previously endorsed Joe Biden for president in 2020 while also serving as the US Ambassador to Turkey under Biden's administration before stepping down earlier this month, according to NBC News.In his statement, Flake expressed his belief in America\u2019s potential, saying, \u201cI believe that America is a great country. I believe that our best days lie ahead. I want to support a candidate for President who believes the same.\"Flake claimed that while he acknowledges differing opinions on various issues, he advocates for a political process that fosters debate and persuasion rather than division. \u201cI want to support a candidate who understands that political opponents are our fellow citizens\u2014the \u2018loyal opposition\u2019 as our parties once knew each other, not the enemy,\u201d he said.Having spent the past three years overseas as a US Ambassador, Flake emphasised the need for a candidate who understands the distinction between adversaries and allies, claiming that real enemies lie abroad.\u201cI believe in our Constitutional system and in the rule of law, and I want to support a candidate who respects the will of the voters and would never attempt to use the powers of the Presidency to overturn an election after having been turned out by the voters,\u201d Flake said.He also underscored his desire for unity and said, \u201cFinally, I want to support a Presidential candidate who seeks to unite our country rather than one who divides us; one who represents the ideals of a new generation of leadership based not on grievances of the past, but hope for the future.\u201d\"I know them. I know first-hand of their fine character and love of country,\" said Flake. \"I've served with Kamala in the US Senate and with Tim in the House of Representatives\", he added.Flake encouraged fellow Republicans to share similar sentiments, saying, \u201cAfter all, in times like these, there is nothing more conservative than putting country over party.\u201dIn an interview with the Hill, Flake said that many conservative Republicans \u201cjust can\u2019t support a candidate like\u201d former President Trump.Democratic candidate and Vice President Kamala Harris is poised to face off against Republican candidate and former President Donald Trump in the upcoming presidential elections scheduled for November 5.",

The running mates of both the presidential candidates will face each other in the one and only debate so far on CBS news.

The November 5 presidential election is bound to be exhilarating with multiple polls showing a tight race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump.\n\nNorah O\u2019Donnell of the CBS Evening News and Margaret Brennan from CBS\u2019s Face the Nation will be our guides through the debate as they moderate the two candidates and make sure the information shared is accurate.\n\nHere is a guide to the debate:\n\nWHEN & WHERE TO WATCH\n\nThe vice-presidential debate is scheduled to be hosted by CBS News and the 90-minute event will commence on October 1 at 9 pm EDT, which for the Indian viewers is going to be an early morning 6:30 am start.\n\nThe debate is being held in New York City, a place that has historically leaned Democrats' way, but Trump is hell-bent on altering that trend. On the other hand, Harris has decided to skip the customary Al Smith dinner, an annual white tie event held in New York City to raise funds for charities helping children.\n\nAs for where to watch, CBS is planning to air the event live on its broadcast network, while also airing it on platforms like CBS News 24/7 and Paramount+\n\nTHE CANDIDATES\n\nTim Walz and JD Vance are bound to give an entertaining performance, being seasoned politicians in one of the biggest democracies in the world.\n\nWalz is the Democratic nominee, who has been standing beside Harris and working the crowd, shoring up votes, especially in the battleground states.\n\nVance, too, has been going to and fro around the country, speaking to voters and getting their votes.\n\nPublished By: Aryan Published On: Sep 28, 2024",

        "text": "Why Tuesday\u2019s vice presidential debate could matter more than history suggests\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Tim Walz and JD Vance might have the chance to reshape the political landscape Tuesday in their first and only debate.\n\nVice presidential picks have traditionally taken on the role of political attack dog, laying into opponents so that their running mate can appear above the political fray. That\u2019s generally been less true since former President Donald Trump scrambled political norms.\n\nBut Walz, the Democratic governor of Minnesota, made it to national prominence by labeling rival Republicans \u201cweird.\u201d Vance, the Republican junior senator from Ohio, has torn into Vice President Kamala Harris ' party on immigration, notably by spreading a false story about Haitian immigrants in his home state that Trump then cited during his own debate with Harris.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at past vice presidential debates \u2014 and the larger role of the office Walz and Vance are both seeking.\n\nWhat to know about Trump\u2019s second term:\n\nStaffing the administration: Here are the people Trump has picked recess appointments Follow all of our coverage as Donald Trump assembles his second administration.\n\nWhat is the vice president\u2019s job?\n\nThe vice president presides over the Senate and is empowered to break ties, as Harris has done a record 33 times. She exceeded the previous high mark last year, which had held since John C. Calhoun was vice president from 1825 to 1832. The officeholder also presides ceremonially in Congress over the certification of electoral results, which Vice President Mike Pence did even after a mob of Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, in a bid to halt the process and transition of power, with some chanting, \u201cHang Mike Pence!\u201d\n\nBut the vice president\u2019s main job is to be ready to take over if something happens to the president. Nine have done so following a president\u2019s death or departure from office \u2014 the last being Gerald Ford, who became president when Richard Nixon resigned in 1974.\n\nThe Constitution\u2019s 25th Amendment, ratified in 1967, spelled out the succession rules, stating that the vice president becomes president \u201cin case of the removal of the president from office or of his death or resignation.\u201d It also allowed the president and Congress to nominate and approve a new vice president if that office is vacated.\n\nVice presidential historian Joel K. Goldstein said two recent assassination attempts against Trump raise \u201cthe saliency of succession.\u201d But he added that many voters view vice presidential nominees as appendages of the candidates who selected them, not necessarily as potential future presidents themselves.\n\n\u201cPeople do look at somebody as, are they ready to be a heartbeat away?\u201d Goldstein said. \u201cBut it is also a question of how good a decisionmaker is the person who chose them.\u201d\n\nMemorable vice presidential debates featured Palin, Bentsen \u2014 and Harris\n\nIn 1992, Adm. James Stockdale, running mate of third-party candidate Ross Perot, was going for breezy but seemed befuddled when he opened the debate by saying, \u201cWho am I? Why am I here?\u201d His later response to a question, \u201cI didn\u2019t have my hearing aid turned up,\u201d only reinforced that perception.\n\nThe debate between No. 2s was highly anticipated in 2008 after Republican Arizona Sen. John McCain selected Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his running mate and saw a bump in the polls. But her showdown with then-Delaware Sen. Joe Biden is best remembered for Palin approaching him before the start and saying, \u201cCan I call you Joe?\u201d That was Palin attempting to keep from mistakenly calling her opponent \u201cO\u2019Biden,\u201d conflating Biden\u2019s name with that of his running mate, then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama.\n\nThe vice presidential nominee and Texas Democratic senator, Lloyd Bentsen, offered a stinging rejoinder against his opponent, Republican Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana, in 1988. After Quayle compared himself to John F. Kennedy, Bentsen replied, \u201cYou\u2019re no Jack Kennedy, senator.\u201d But it was one of the Democratic ticket\u2019s few high points in a race it lost handily.\n\nIn 2020, Harris faced off with Republican Vice President Mike Pence and declared when he tried to interrupt her, \u201cI\u2019m speaking,\u201d a line she\u2019s reprised in this campaign. But both candidates might have been overshadowed by a fly that perched on Pence\u2019s hair for what felt like an eternity.\n\nWill the debate affect the campaign?\n\nA nominee\u2019s choice of No. 2 has historically made little Election Day difference. This year could be different.\n\nHistorical analysis by Mark P. Jones, a political science professor at Rice University in Houston, suggests that voters aren\u2019t really swayed by a candidate\u2019s running mate. Even the idea of using a pick to balance a ticket \u2014 like pairing the first major party nominee who is a woman of color with a white male in the case of Harris selecting Walz \u2014 may also be overstated.\n\n\u201cThe evidence we have is that they\u2019re really voting for the presidential nominee,\u201d Jones said of Americans through the decades.\n\nA key caveat might be that, given just how close the current race is looking to be in swing states, \u201cIt\u2019s always possible that, at the margins, it may matter,\u201d Jones said.\n\nOne reason why the Walz-Vance debate might shift more opinions this year is that Harris and Trump shared a stage only once, in early September. That means Tuesday may be the last chance before Election Day for voters to see the two tickets square off directly.\n\nBut, more likely, both Walz and Vance will simply need to avoid memorable unforced errors that can be endlessly replayed. Jones said such a race-shifting gaffe is unlikely \u2014 but not impossible.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re disciplined,\u201d Jones said. \u201cBut all it takes is one.\u201d",

The debate may provide the moment of decision for some voters and even a tipping point in a closely balanced electorate.\n\nMuch of the electorate is still getting to know the running mates chosen by former President Donald Trump and Vice President Harris. Trump\u2019s choice, Ohio\u2019s JD Vance, has only been in the Senate since last year and Harris\u2019 Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota has not previously campaigned for office outside his home state.\n\nAll 11 previous running mate debates have taken place in the month of October, just as the media and campaign aficionados find themselves needing a new angle on the presidential race. They have usually been mixed in with multiple debates between the presidential candidates themselves. But after one meeting with Harris, Trump is saying it is too late for another. So the Vance-Walz debate appears to offer the campaign\u2019s last live confrontation.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThat makes this October 1 match in New York seem far more important than the VP\u2019s usual \u201cundercard\u201d status: In boxing terms, it could be the main event of the campaign\u2019s final month. That expectation and tension have hovered over the Battle of the Twos in every four-year cycle for decades now, and it\u2019s worth recalling how much media heat and drama they have generated.\n\nRewind to the first one\n\nThe first vice presidential debate was in 1976, the year of America\u2019s Bicentennial, when the political system needed something to restore people\u2019s faith. The nation was emerging from a decade of dissension, dispirited by the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandals that forced President Richard Nixon from office.\n\nThe 1976 presidential contest was between the unelected incumbent Republican Gerald Ford, who had been Nixon\u2019s vice president, and a newcomer named Jimmy Carter, the former governor of Georgia. (Carter will turn 100 on Tuesday, the day of the Vance-Walz debate.)\n\ntoggle caption Bettmann/Getty Images\n\nIn that year, both nominees reached out to the disaffected in their own parties with their vice presidential picks. Ford chose Kansas Sen. Bob Dole, a conservative he hoped would placate those who had preferred Ronald Reagan as that year\u2019s GOP presidential nominee. Carter, a Southern moderate, chose the well-known liberal Sen. Walter Mondale of Minnesota. Both men would later rise to the top of the ticket in their respective parties, but neither would ever win the White House.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nTheir debate in 1976 has been remembered chiefly for a phrase uttered by Dole when talking about foreign policy. A decorated veteran of the Second World War, Dole referred to the several conflicts of the 20th century as \u201cDemocrat wars.\u201d Indeed, there had been Democrats in office when each of the world wars and the Korean conflict began, but support for U.S. participation had been generally bipartisan. Dole seemed to be tapping a well of isolationist sentiment long dormant in the GOP \u2013 but never extinct.\n\nThe Dole controversy lasted a few days and provided videotape for later discussions of his career, but if it did any damage it was hard to discern in November\u2019s outcome. Ford, who had been far behind Carter in the early fall, closed the gap in the closing days and nearly won.\n\n1980 and 1984: Mondale, Bush and Ferraro\n\ntoggle caption Wally McNamee/Corbis via Getty Images\n\nIn 1980 the VP nominees were Mondale and former congressman and CIA Director George H.W. Bush, the No. 2 for Reagan, who had won the Republican presidential nomination on his third try. The debate was scheduled for Louisville, Ky., on October 2 but canceled three days earlier when both Mondale and Bush declined to attend. There had been disagreements over the inclusion of a third candidate, Patrick Lucey, the former governor of Wisconsin who was the running mate of independent candidate John Anderson that year.\n\nBush was back as the incumbent vice president in 1984 and game for a debate with the first woman ever included on a major party\u2019s national ticket, Rep. Geraldine Ferraro of New York. Ferraro, a former prosecutor, was poised and assured and gave Democrats a shot in the arm. At one point she took exception to Bush\u2019s dismissive tone: \u201cI almost resent \u2026 your patronizing attitude that you have to teach me about foreign policy.\u201d\n\nMondale was also back that fall, at the top of the Democratic ticket, and having done well in his first debate with Reagan, he took to featuring that performance and Ferraro\u2019s in his campaign appearances. \u201cHave you been watching the debates?\u201d he would ask, and the crowds, such as they were, would roar.\n\nBush generated a ruckus after the debate when an open microphone overheard him saying he had \u201ctried to kick a little ass.\u201d But none of the back and forth over the debates that autumn could have mattered much Reagan was cruising toward a second term and won every state but Mondale\u2019s Minnesota, where he came within one-fifth of one percentage point.\n\nVP debates\u2019 single greatest hit\n\nPerhaps the best illustration of vice presidential debates elevating a candidate who would still lose in the election Lloyd Bentsen, the silver-haired Texas senator who ran with Democrat Michael S. Dukakis in 1988. Bentsen had the stature in Washington and also the appeal to the heartland that Dukakis lacked. He had also taken the measure of the youthful senator from Indiana whom Bush, now his party\u2019s pick for president, had added to the GOP ticket.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nQuayle had been elected to the Senate at age 33 and was just 41 when he faced Bentsen, 26 years his senior. Answering a question about his experience, Quayle said he\u2019d had \u201cas much experience in Congress\u201d as John F. Kennedy had when he was elected president at 43 in 1960.\n\nBentsen fixed his opponent with an appraising stare as he said: \u201cSenator, I served with Jack Kennedy. I knew Jack Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, you\u2019re no Jack Kennedy.\u201d\n\nThe crowd whooped. A crestfallen Quayle recovered enough to say: \u201cThat was really uncalled for, senator.\u201d But if there had been a referee he would have stopped the fight right there.\n\nStill, in November, the Bush-Quayle ticket carried 40 states and won easily.\n\nNo vice presidential debate since then has produced quite such a dramatic highpoint, but there have been several that left an indelible impression.\n\nIn 1992, Quayle was back as the incumbent vice president and as Bush\u2019s designated attack dog against the Democratic ticket of Bill Clinton, then governor of Arkansas, and running mate Al Gore, then a senator from Tennessee.\n\nBut both Quayle and Gore were upstaged by the presence of a third debater, the only such addition to the format in the history of vice presidential faceoffs to date. He was retired Adm. James A. Stockdale, a hero of the Vietnam War who had been a prisoner of war and an organizer and spokesman for other POWs at the time. Stockdale was the running mate for independent candidate H. Ross Perot, a billionaire businessman who also took part in the presidential debates with Bush and Clinton.\n\nBut on debate night, Stockdale looked uncomfortable on stage and had trouble with his hearing aid. His opening -- \u201cWho am I? What am I doing here?\u201d \u2013 came across not as introductory so much as genuinely confused. It was fodder for parody and was being mercilessly mocked almost before the debate was over.\n\nDid Stockdale hurt Perot? Not visibly. The Clinton-Gore ticket won in 1992, but Perot-Stockdale got 19% of the popular vote in November, the best showing for a third-option ticket since the 1912 \u201cBullmoose\u201d heyday of Theodore Roosevelt.\n\nSurprises abound but prove inconclusive\n\nGore returned in 1996 as the incumbent vice president to debate Rep. Jack Kemp, the vice presidential choice of Dole, who was back as the GOP nominee against Clinton. Gore and Kemp had served in the House together before Gore\u2019s election to the Senate in 1984. Their debate was spirited but cordial, and many Republicans later said their guy should have been more aggressive. In any event, the incumbents won the vote that mattered that November.\n\nIn 2000, Gore was at the top of the ticket and surprised many by choosing Sen. Joe Lieberman, a party moderate from Connecticut who had been critical of Clinton. It appeared to be an effort to distance Gore from Clinton, in part because Lieberman had been outspoken in criticizing Clinton for the relationship with a White House intern that led to Clinton\u2019s 1998 impeachment.\n\ntoggle caption Jeff Kowalsky/AFP via Getty Images\n\nLieberman was the government official in his debate with Dick Cheney, who was at the time the chairman of a private company servicing the oil-and-gas industry. But Cheney had also been in the Republican leadership in the House and been Bush\u2019s secretary of defense during the first Persian Gulf War. He asserted a kind of seniority over his Democratic rival in the debate, even though Lieberman was just a year younger and a sitting senator at the time. If there had been any doubt about Cheney when picked by GOP presidential nominee George W. Bush, such doubt was dispelled in the debate.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nA few weeks later, in one of the closest elections in U.S. history, the Bush-Cheney ticket lost the popular vote but squeaked by in the Electoral College thanks to a 537-vote edge in Florida that took five weeks and a Supreme Court Decision to decide.\n\nAs the incumbent vice president four years later, Cheney was every bit as much in command when paired with Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina, the running mate choice of Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts. With the memory of the terror attacks of September 2001 still vivid in voters\u2019 minds, Cheney had an advantage and kept a grip on it, knowing his reputation for glowering toughness fit the moment better than Edwards\u2019 freshness and Southern charm.\n\nThat November\u2019s outcome was not quite as close as in 2004, but the early exit polls had pointed to a Kerry-Edwards win. It was only when Ohio went for Bush-Cheney late that evening that the Electoral College had a winner.\n\nRenewed interest in 2008\n\nThe atmosphere in the country was notably different four years later in 2008. Feeling the wind at their back as a party, Democrats fought almost all the way to the convention over whether to nominate Hillary Clinton, bidding to be the first woman president, or Barack Obama, bidding to be the first Black president. Obama prevailed and chose a Senate colleague old enough to be his father, Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware, to be his running mate. Biden had connections to the white, working-class voters Obama had been losing in the primaries that year.\n\nAnd Biden did well in his debate with the Republican running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, who had added verve and excitement to the ticket headed by Sen. John McCain of Arizona. While Palin was bound to be the focus of the debate, Biden had opportunities and made the most of them.\n\ntoggle caption Paul J. Richards/AFP via Getty Images\n\nAt the time, Wall Street was experiencing a crisis over mortgage-backed securities that would trigger a credit crunch and a downturn soon to be dubbed \u201cthe Great Recession.\u201d So Biden\u2019s gravitas as a six-term senator was as welcome as his roots in blue-collar America. A month later he was the vice president-elect.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIn 2012, Biden\u2019s task was entirely different. Obama\u2019s reelection was opposed by former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, and Biden found himself onstage with the brainy and capable Paul Ryan, the chairman of the House Budget Committee and almost 30 years Biden\u2019s junior. Ryan had first come to Washington as a congressional intern for Jack Kemp, and like him, he would be criticized for not attacking the incumbent vice president he faced in the debate. In any event, the Biden-Ryan meeting produced no surprises and probably no effect on the Obama-Biden reelection the following month.\n\nThis low-impact trend has continued in the last two vice presidential debates. It takes a moment to even remember the 2016 debate between Mike Pence, then the sitting governor of Indiana, and Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia. Pence had little trouble keeping the emphasis on the man who had put him on that stage, Donald Trump, and on the social issues that Trump wanted him to promote.\n\nKaine, who had been governor of Virginia and chairman of the Democratic National Committee moving on to the Senate in 2012, also made Trump the centerpiece of his debate performance, saying Trump was \u201cscary\u201d as commander in chief and far too well-disposed toward dictators and authoritarians in other countries.\n\nBut a few weeks later, when Trump-Pence had prevailed over Clinton-Kaine, no one was talking about what had happened in the running mates\u2019 debate.\n\nIn our own time\n\nFour years later, during the COVID pandemic\n\nas he ignored a fly\n\ntoggle caption Morry Gash/POOL/AFP via Getty Images\n\nPence\u2019s Democratic rival was Biden\u2019s running mate, Kamala Harris, then a sitting senator from California, who was equally loyal when defending both Biden and herself. And she was not shy about taking on the social issues such as abortion that were so important to Pence\u2019s portfolio.\n\nJust three months later, a crowd of rioters would chant \u201cHang Mike Pence\u201d and erect a makeshift scaffold on the steps of the U.S. Capitol because Pence had refused Trump\u2019s urging to block the certification of the Electoral College results. Pence refused to leave the Capitol that night and in the wee hours of morning he supervised the process by which the Biden-Harris ticket formalized its win.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nPence also returned to the campaign trail to seek the GOP\u2019s 2024 presidential nomination as an alternative to Trump. Pence took part in several of the debates among the candidates, separating himself from Trump on the question of certifying the 2020 election but otherwise defending the Trump record. Unable to make much headway in polls or amass a competitive war chest, he dropped out months before the first primary was held.\n\nDespite the frustrations of Quayle and Pence, the TV-era tradition by which former vice presidents have gone on to be their party\u2019s presidential nominee is impressive (Nixon, Hubert Humphrey, Ford, Mondale, Gore, Biden and the first President Bush).\n\nAnd it continues this year with Harris, who will note that four of her seven predecessors in this group made it to the Oval Office.",

        "text": "Poll: Democrats' advantage with Latino voters continues to shrink\nVice President Kamala Harris is leading former President Donald Trump among Latino voters. But that advantage has declined to Democrats\u2019 lowest level in the past four presidential cycles, according to a new national NBC News/Telemundo/CNBC poll.\n\nOverall, the poll shows that Democratic presidential candidate Harris has lost some ground with Latinos at a time when these consequential voters are more likely than the general electorate to cite the economy and the rising cost of living as top priorities. On both of these issues, Latino voters give Trump the advantage, but a majority of them prefer Harris on temperament, competency and having the necessary mental and physical health to be president.\n\nSupport for Harris is at 54% among registered Latino voters, according to the poll, while Trump gets 40% and another 6% say they\u2019re unsure or wouldn\u2019t vote. The margin of error in the poll is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.\n\nWhile Harris\u2019 14-point advantage is an improvement from President Joe Biden\u2019s standing when he was at the top of the ticket, it is still lower than the past leads Democratic presidential candidates enjoyed in 2012 (by 39 points), 2016 (50 points) and 2020 (36 points), according to NBC\u2019s merged polling data from those past cycles.\n\n(Ultimately, Democratic presidential candidates ended up winning Latino voters by 44 points in 2012, 38 points in 2016 and 33 points in 2020, according to the NBC News exit polls in those years.)\n\nSimilarly, Latino voters\u2019 preference for which party controls Congress stands at 54% Democrats, 42% Republicans \u2014 a much narrower gap than in past years.\n\nDriving the declining support for Democrats in the presidential contest are defections from Latino men, particularly those without college degrees and those under the age of 50, the poll shows. But solid Democratic support from Hispanic women, or Latinas, has helped offset some of that erosion.\n\nSurveying 1,000 Latino voters nationwide in English and Spanish, the poll also finds a striking split on immigration between Latino voters who prioritize a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and preventing discrimination, and those who focus more on border enforcement.\n\nThe latest findings underscore the political diversity of Latinos, which mirror broader divisions seen across the general electorate.\n\n\u201cLatino voters are incredibly diverse. It can\u2019t be overstressed,\u201d said Democratic pollster Aileen Cardona-Arroyo of Hart Research Associates, who conducted the poll with Republican pollster Micah Roberts and his team at Public Opinion Strategies. \u201cWe are looking at Latino voters rather than a consolidated Latino community.\u201d\n\nTrump is ahead on the economy, but more Latinos see Harris as a better leader\n\nThe NBC News/Telemundo/CNBC poll asked Latino voters which presidential candidate is better on protecting immigrant rights, securing the border and fighting crime, as well as dealing with abortion issues, the economy and the rising cost of living.\n\nThose surveyed give Harris the advantage on the issues of immigrant rights (a 39-point lead over Trump), abortion (+32) and crime (+5).\n\nTrump receives the advantage on dealing with inflation and the cost of living (9-point lead over Harris) and the economy (+4 points), as well as securing and controlling the border (+13 points). A majority of Latinos in the poll \u2014 a combined 54% \u2014 say the cost of living and the economy are their top issues.\n\nAfter watching the first presidential debate between Harris and Trump, Victor Gutierrez, 62, of New Jersey said he is \u201cleaning toward Trump because I believe he has a better grasp on what to do as president\u201d based on his stances on the economy and border security. For Gutierrez, who is Puerto Rican, Harris came off as too performative during the debate, which he said made him distrustful.\n\nBut according to the poll, when it comes to deciding who possesses the necessary leadership qualities and personal traits to be president, Latinos favor Harris over Trump in all of the seven categories surveyed \u2014 including having the right temperament to be president (+28 points), having the necessary mental and physical health (+25 points), being honest and trustworthy (+26 points) and representing change (+21 points).\n\nMichelle Garc\u00eda, 49, said she sees Harris as a leader who represents communities that have historically lacked a voice in government \u2014 such as women, people of color and immigrants.\n\nGarc\u00eda, who is of Peruvian and Puerto Rican descent, spent her Saturday knocking on doors in her community in Maryland to get people to vote for Harris. Some of the main issues driving Garc\u00eda\u2019s support for Harris are her outspokenness on fixing the economy by closing the nation\u2019s growing wealth gap and the fact that Harris is unapologetically in favor of abortion rights, she said.\n\nThe poll also asks Latino voters which political party is better at addressing the Hispanic community\u2019s concerns. By a 47%-20% margin, Latino voters prefer the Democratic Party \u2014 essentially unchanged from when the poll asked this same question in 2022.\n\nBut the Democratic advantage declines to 11 points, 39%-28%, when Latino voters are asked which party better shares their values \u2014 a drop from the Democrats\u2019 19-point edge here two years ago.\n\nLatino support varies widely by gender and religion\n\nIn California, Hispanic voters Matthew Delao, 60, and Fredy Arguello, 50, have historically voted for both Democratic and Republican presidential candidates in previous elections. But this year, Delao has decided to vote for Trump, saying he realized he was better off economically during his presidency. Arguello is solidly supporting Harris, because he views her as having the necessary experience and character to lead the country.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no comparison. You\u2019re talking about a former state attorney, someone who has served the public,\u201d Arguello said about Harris, \u201cversus someone like Trump, who has no moral standing.\u201d\n\nBut Delao strongly believes Democrats are \u201cjust giving away so many things to people who shouldn\u2019t need it,\u201d he said, adding that it is important to him that whoever wins the White House \u201cshould concentrate on the United States, concentrate on your own people.\u201d\n\nTheir divide is representative of how Harris and Trump are splitting the vote evenly among Latino men, with each getting 47% support, the poll shows, versus Harris\u2019 26-point lead among Latinas.\n\nThat\u2019s a shift from NBC\u2019s merged polling from 2020, when Biden held a 20-point lead over Trump among Latino men. Young Hispanic voters ages 18 to 34 have also moved, supporting Harris over Trump by 10 points (51%-41%), down from Biden\u2019s 44-point lead in 2020 (66%-22%).\n\nAmong Latino men, Trump gets more support from men under 50 (they break for him over Harris, 51%-42%) and from those without college degrees (who prefer Trump, 51%-38%), according to this poll.\n\nMeanwhile, Harris\u2019 stronghold remains with Latinas over 50 (winning them 74%-22%) and Hispanic women with college degrees (61%-35%).\n\nAs a college graduate who worked through school and is also still paying off her student loans, Garc\u00eda believes Harris is better equipped to understand \u201cwhat it\u2019s like to struggle.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a humbling experience. That takes grit. And as a woman, that represents me,\u201d said Garc\u00eda.\n\nAmong religious Latinos, support is split, the poll shows.\n\nCatholic Latinos back Harris over Trump by 20 points (56%-36%) while Trump leads among evangelical Latinos, 64%-28%. Nonreligious Latinos voiced support for Harris by more than 40 points (71%-24%).\n\nA striking split on immigration\n\nWhat also stands out in the poll are Latinos\u2019 changing attitudes on immigration, as well as a stark divide on their immigration priorities.\n\nSixty-two percent of Latino voters believe immigration helps more than it hurts, versus 35% who think it hurts more than it helps. That 35% share saying immigration hurts more than it helps is the highest share of Latino voters coming down on that side in two decades of asking the question.\n\nIn addition, when asked to pick their bigger priority, 52% of Latino voters said it was more important to prevent discrimination against immigrants and to create a pathway to citizenship, versus 46% who said it was more important to secure the border and stop immigrants from entering the country illegally.\n\nOther findings\n\nIn the battle for control of Congress, Democrats hold a double-digit lead in congressional preference \u2014 but it\u2019s down from past election cycles.\n\nIn this poll, 54% of Latino voters prefer a Democratic-controlled Congress, versus 42% who want Republicans in charge.\n\nThat 12-point lead represents a steady decline from September 2012 (when the Democrats\u2019 advantage was 45 points), September 2016 (when it was 34 points), October 2020 (26 points) and September 2022 before that midterm election (21 points).\n\nA demographic profile of Latino voters\n\n52% say they primarily speak English, while the rest primarily speak Spanish or speak both languages.\n\n56% trace their family\u2019s heritage to Mexico, 16% to Puerto Rico, 11% to Spain, 5% to Cuba and 5% to the Dominican Republic.\n\n49% identify as Democratic, 37% as Republican and 13% as independent.\n\n32% say they\u2019re liberal, 37% are moderate, and 29% are conservative.\n\n49% are Catholic, 21% are Protestant and 28% described themselves as other/none.\n\nThe NBC News/Telemundo/CNBC Latino poll of 1,000 registered Latino voters was conducted Sept. 16-23. Fifty-three% of respondents were reached by cellphone, 10% were reached by landline, and 37% were reached text-to-web. Overall, 20% of the interviews were conducted in Spanish. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.",

An estimated 36.2 million Latinos are eligible to vote in the November election. That's up nearly 4 million people since 2020.\n\nHowever, voter registration among both of these groups of voters lags behind White voter registration.\n\nThe fastest growing group of eligible voters in the U.S. is Asian Americans followed by Latinos, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\n\"I think one of the biggest issues is actually language access. When you look at the Asian American community, you have over 50 percent of individuals that speak a language other than English. And I think access is a real challenge for a lot of individuals,\" Vice President of Community Impact with the Chinese American Service League Thy Nguyen said.\n\nNguyen added that voters need election materials in their language.\n\nJose Marco-Paredes is Vice President of Civic Engagement with the Latino Policy Forum.\n\nMarco-Paredes said there are three key reasons that Latino voter registration lags behind that of White Voters.\n\nLatino voters tend to be younger, compared to other racial and ethnic groups, \"and youth are less reliable voters.\"\n\nWhen it comes to the candidates, Democrat Kamala Harris is the first Asian-American woman at the top of a major party ticket. But does that carry weight with Asian-American voters?\n\n\"I think it definitely does,\" Nguyen said. \"I think it's certainly creating a level of excitement that we're seeing in the community. A recent survey that came out from AAPI stated that 77 percent of Asian-American voters really do identify with one's culture and background. So, the fact that Kamala Harris is South Asian I think is really resonating with voters.\"\n\nHowever, Nguyen said that given the diversity within the Asian-American community while there is a level of excitement, it is a little more complex.\n\nThe fastest growing group of eligible voters in the U.S. is Asian Americans followed by Latinos, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nBoth Asian-Americans and Latinos will be voting on issues of concerns to all Americans.\n\n\"All the polls have shown that the Latino community cares about the same issues that anyone else. Kitchen table issues. Economy, inflation, am I going to be able to put food on my table? Are my kids going to have a good education,\" Marco-Paredes said.\n\n\"I think the issues that really matter are the same,\" Nguyen said about the Asian-American community. \"It's affordable healthcare, employment, jobs. Those things really matter.\"\n\nEarly voters may choose to vote in one of 12 languages according to the Chicago Board of Elections website: English, Spanish, Chinese, Hindi, Polish, Korean, Tagalog, Gujarati, Urdu, Arabic, Ukrainian, and Russian.\n\nEarly Voting in Downtown Chicago will start on Thursday, October 3 at 9:00am and run through Election Day (Nov. 5) at the Voting Supersite (191 N. Clark) and Board Offices (69 W. Washington St. - 6th Floor).",

        "text": "Beyond Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, a multitude of small things can change the US election\nIn this head-spinning presidential election, where should we fix our gaze?\n\nDonald Trump, needless to say, commands round-the-clock attention. Even a quiet Sunday afternoon on the golf course, where earlier this month he was stalked by a would-be assassin, became breaking news.\n\nKamala Harris is a gripping figure, whether headlining the kind of joyful stadium rallies Democrats have not witnessed since the Obama years or sitting for a heart-to-heart with Oprah Winfrey.\n\nVice-presidential candidates do not ordinarily get much of a look-in, but JD Vance and Tim Walz have both become scene-stealers.\n\nThe dramatis personae has also included the actor George Clooney, the wrestler Hulk Hogan, the former Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and a once obscure far-right provocateur named Laura Loomer, who the Trump campaign evidently wants to make a speedy return to obscurity. In the week which marked the 25th anniversary of The West Wing, nor should we overlook the current occupant of the Oval Office, one Joseph Robinette Biden Jr.\n\nYet the fringe theatre could also determine his successor. The off-Broadway drama. In an election likely to turn on a small shift of votes in a small number of states, seemingly small things could end up being of out-sized significance.\n\nAnything that drives or depresses turn-out in the seven swing states \u2014 Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin \u2014 has the potential to be determining. Nor should we ignore Nebraska, but more of that later.\n\nLoading...\n\nAbortion ballots in two states\n\nTwo of those seven battlegrounds, for instance, have ballot initiatives on abortion \u2014 an issue which has received considerable attention following the overturning of Roe v Wade in 2022 though arguably not enough.\n\nIn Arizona, voters have the opportunity to codify \"the fundamental right of abortion,\" a ballot initiative that could boost turn-out especially amongst young women. In Nevada, too, a proposed amendment to the state constitution enshrining abortion access is also on the ballot.\n\nAbortion is not the paramount issue in either of these Sunbelt states. A Fox News poll in August found that 16 per cent of Arizona voters and 13 per cent of Nevada voters consider it their most pressing question. But those voters, in a photo-finish election, loom large. In 2020, Biden beat Trump in Nevada by just 33,596 votes. In Arizona, his victory margin was even narrower, 10,457 votes, just 0.3 per cent of the more than 3 million ballots cast. Watch that space.\n\nThe outcome in Georgia\n\nIn Georgia, another state that Biden won narrowly (11,779 votes), rule changes enacted by the Republican-controlled state legislature have been designed to advantage Trump.\n\nFirst of all, the changes have undercut the authority of the Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who in the aftermath of the 2020 election bravely rejected Trump's request to \"find 11,780\" votes (the former president is presently fighting state criminal charges in Georgia, related to that call, of unlawfully conspiring to change the outcome of the election in Georgia).\n\nAmerica can't escape its history Photo shows A graphic depicting an American flag that has been torn in half, with a shadow hanging over it. Of all the schisms that cleave contemporary America, few are more stark than the divide between those who consider themselves to be victims of US history and those who fear they will be casualties of its future.\n\nThey also potentially pave for the way for three Trump supporting Republicans on the five-member State Election Board to delay the certification of Georgia's results beyond the national deadline of December 11 if they find any evidence \u2014 or give credence to any specious rumours \u2014 of voting irregularities. \"Pit bulls fighting for honesty, transparency and victory\" is how Trump has characterised the three Republicans. The Democrats, meanwhile, have launched legal action against them.\n\nPolls suggest the former president is presently ahead in Georgia. If, however, Harris were to come out on top, the State Election Board, with its Republican majority, could feasibly attempt to block her from receiving its 16 Electoral College votes.\n\nAlways it is worth remembering that presidential elections do not have standardised rules. Under the US constitution, every state has the right to define its own voting methods. So a dispute in Georgia could throw the nationwide election into what they New York Times has described as \"a legal grey area.\"\n\nLoading...\n\nChasing Nebraska's blue dot\n\nIn Nebraska, meanwhile, Republicans have been trying to alter the way its electoral votes are allocated. Of the 50 states, 48 allot their electoral votes on a winner-takes-all basis. Maine and Nebraska allocate their 5 votes to reflect both the state popular vote and also the outcomes in its four congressional districts. In 2020, this enabled Joe Biden to pick up one electoral vote in this overwhelmingly red state by winning the congressional district that takes in Omaha, its biggest city.\n\nIf Harris were also to pick up one electoral vote in Nebraska \u2014 the \"blue dot,\" as it has been called \u2014 she could afford to lose Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina, but still win the White House so long as she won all the usual reliably blue states along the three swing Rust Belt states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nTo cut off that straightforward path to victory, Trump for months has been pressing for a change to the rules to make Nebraska a winner-takes-all state. But this week, the pivotal Republican state lawmaker, Mike McDonnell, who switched parties from the Democrats only this year, announced he favoured the status quo. This meant Trump allies fell one vote short.\n\nIf Nebraska provides Harris's winning margin in the Electoral College, McDonnell, a former fire chief, will become more than a footnote in history. He will have altered its course.\n\nLoading YouTube content\n\nNorth Carolina's governor race\n\nThen there is North Carolina, where the race for the Governor's mansion is spilling over into the race for the White House.\n\nIn a scandal that speaks once more of the Jerry Springerisation of US politics, the Republican nominee for Governor, Mark Robinson, has faced calls to step aside after CNN reported that he referred to himself more than a decade ago as \"a black NAZI\" on a pornographic website.\n\nThe African-American Republican, a featured speaker at the party's convention, also defended slavery and said he enjoyed watching transgender porn, even though publicly he opposes transgender rights. Robinson has denied the claims. \"Those are not the words of Mark Robinson,\" he protested. But the scandal could tar Donald Trump, who earlier this year heralded Robinson, the Lieutenant Governor, as \"Martin Luther King on steroids.\"\n\nNorth Carolina has only twice gone Democrat since the late-1960s \u2014 in 1976, when Jimmy Carter won the state, and in 2008 when voters backed Barack Obama. In 2020, however, Trump only won by 1.3 per cent, and polls suggest this red state has become more purple since Kamala Harris became the Democrat's presidential nominee.\n\nIts 16 electoral votes are very much up for grabs, and a lesson from the Trump years is that scandal-prone MAGA Republicans running in state and congressional elections have caused the party to underperform.\n\nLoading\n\nWe need sharp peripheral vision\n\nRarely, if ever, has a presidential election had so many moving parts.\n\nWhat impact will the Middle East conflict, which this week saw a dramatic escalation, have on Muslim-American voters, a comparatively small but largely Democratic constituency. In Pennsylvania, some 125,000 Muslims voted in 2020. Biden's winning margin was 81,000 votes. Muslim-Americans also helped Biden win Georgia and Michigan.\n\nCould the Green Party candidate, Jill Stein, wreck Harris's chances, as she did for Hillary Clinton in 2016? Had Stein backers become Clinton voters in the Rust Belt trifecta of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, America would have already had its first madam president.\n\nIn this electoral panorama, then, there is a lot to keep an eye on. Rather than a singular focus, it requires sharp peripheral vision.\n\nNick Bryant, a former BBC Washington correspondent, is the author of The Forever War: America's Unending Conflict with Itself.",

In Wisconsin, a state where polls have a history of overstating support for Democrats, Ms. Harris holds 49 percent to Mr. Trump\u2019s 47 percent.\n\nThe polls also found that Ms. Harris had a lead of nine percentage points over Mr. Trump in Nebraska\u2019s Second Congressional District, whose lone electoral vote could be decisive in the Electoral College. In one possible scenario, the district could give Ms. Harris exactly the 270 electoral votes she would need to win the election if she carried Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania and Mr. Trump captured the Sun Belt battlegrounds, where Times/Siena polls show he is ahead.",

        "text": "Battleground states see waves of new voters sign up who could sway 2024 race\n(This story has been updated to note Arizona's electorate grew by nearly 125,000 voters from between August of 2020 to the end of July 2024.)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Recent spikes in voter registrations are shaking up the already contentious 2024 presidential race, with hundreds of thousands of new voters now signed up to cast ballots and help determine who resides in the White House for the next four years.\n\nIn the majority of the seven key battleground states where Republican nominee Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris are particularly close in the polls, the current number of registered voters is up compared with the 2020 presidential contest that coincided with the COVID-19 global pandemic.\n\nNorth Carolina, as one example, boasts nearly a half million more registered people in 2024 compared with 2020, when Trump eked out a win over Joe Biden in the Tar Heel State by about 74,000 votes.\n\nOver in Michigan, the total count of registered voters has grown by more than 350,000 since October of 2020. Biden's margin of victory that year over Trump in the midwestern battleground state: a little more than 150,000 votes.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nSimilar voter registration trends are also playing out in Arizona, where Biden bested Trump in 2020 by about 10,500 votes, and Nevada, where the current Democratic president beat his predecessor by nearly 33,600 votes. Between August 2020 and the end of July this year, the Arizona electorate grew by nearly 125,000 voters. In Nevada \u2212 the least populated of this year's swing states \u2212 more than 260,000 additional registered voters have signed up compared with this time four years ago.\n\nThere's an important caveat to this data: Registered voters are not the same thing as actual voters, which is why the Trump and Harris campaigns are focused heading into November on driving up turnout among their core constituencies while also finding potential new pockets of supporters.\n\nKeeping up with Election 2024? Sign up for USA TODAY's On Politics newsletter.\n\nThe surge in names that have been added to the voter rolls happens for a variety of reasons. For one, more than 8 million people across the U.S. are newly eligible to vote upon reaching their 18th birthday since the last mid-election cycle in 2022, according to the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts University. On top of that, election experts told USA TODAY that several specific recent events \u2013 including Biden's decision to stand down in place of Harris and a particular high-profile celebrity endorsement \u2013 could be motivating factors behind many of the new registrations.\n\nMichael McDonald, a professor of political science at the University of Florida, said that voter registrations reliably increase every campaign season as Election Day nears, especially during events such a national political convention.\n\n\u201cWhat's different this year,\u201d he said, \u201cis we're seeing a different campaign event.\u201d\n\nMajor moments lead to major voting interest\n\nA tumultuous summer in politics culminated in Biden\u2019s late July decision to drop out of the presidential race and throw his support behind Harris, his incumbent vice president.\n\nHarris' campaign kickoff roused a flood of donations, refreshed enthusiasm among liberal voters and seemingly launched a surge of voter registrations. In the 48 hours that followed Harris taking over, nearly 39,000 people registered to vote, according to the nonpartisan platform Vote.org. Less than a week after that, the number surpassed 100,000.\n\nFrom door knockers to donors:Harris' war chest has many first-time contributors\n\nThen came pop icon Taylor Swift\u2019s endorsement of Harris via Instagram. Her post, which garnered more than 11 million likes and followed right after Harris\u2019 Sept. 10 debate with Trump, included a custom URL to voting resources and a call for fans to get registered.\n\nVote.gov received 405,999 visitors in the 24 hours following Swift\u2019s announcement, according to a General Services Administration spokesperson. In comparison, the website had about 30,000 daily visitors in the week prior.\n\nIt was unclear how many of these visitors successfully registered. Vote.gov itself is not a registration page but directs users to websites with state-specific information.\n\nSwing states could see more voters in 2024\n\nDuring National Voter Registration Day on Sept. 17, Vote.org reported registering more than 150,000 new voters, a record for the organization during the annual civic holiday.\n\nSixteen percent of those came from the seven key swing states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nNorth Carolina had one of the largest jumps in total registered voters between now and this time four years ago, with more than 500,000 additional voters, according to the North Carolina State Board of Elections. In 2020, Trump narrowly won the Tar Heel State's 15 Electoral College votes.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, the current number of registered voters is about 150,000 less compared with Election Day in 2020, when Biden won the commonwealth by about 80,500 votes. But there are already about 60,000 more voters in the state as of late September than there were during the 2022 midterm elections, when Democrats won critical and closely contended races for governor and the U.S. Senate.\n\nA Swift surge of voters?What data says about new PA voter registration\n\nThe handful of battleground states emerged as the ones to watch given their neck-and-neck numbers of Republicans and Democrats, which puts each in the position to tip the scales for either Trump or Harris. The Trump campaign recently told Fox News they have put \"maximum attention and resources\" into boosting Republican registrations in these states.\n\n\"And in states where the winner will be decided by mere percentage points, it could make all the difference,\" Trump campaign senior adviser Tim Murtaugh said.\n\nEfforts by the Trump campaign and GOP allies appear to be paying off: In all four swing states where voters register by party, Republicans have grown their share of voters since 2020. In Arizona, Republicans have extended their lead over Democrats, with nearly 260,000 more red than blue registered voters. And in North Carolina, Nevada and Pennsylvania, Republicans have cut significantly into the Democratic advantage.\n\n'Shot in the arm' for Democrats\n\nAcross the board, voter growth isn\u2019t limited to the battlegrounds.\n\nNationwide, the number of voters registering in late July following Harris\u2019 ascension were as much as triple that compared to the same time four years ago, said Tom Bonier, Democratic strategist and CEO of political data provider TargetSmart.\n\nMany of the new registrants, he said, have been younger voters and more specifically, younger women and younger women of color.\n\nHis best comparison: The summer of 2022, when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the case that made abortion legal nationwide.\n\n\"At the time we saw that and thought, \u2018Wow, you'll never see anything like this again. We haven't seen anything like it before,\u2019\u201d Bonier said.\n\nBonier said numbers from this summer, though, exceeded what they witnessed then.\n\nThe potential influx of new voters from these certain demographics could be a boon for Democrats, who tend to score well with voters under 35 and, prior to the Biden-Harris ticket shake-up, were being largely outpaced by Republicans in terms of registrations, McDonald said.\n\n\u201cDemocrats have needed to get this shot in the arm,\u201d he said. \u201cHarris' entry provided the opportunity for people to become enthused and start registering.\u201d\n\nOwen Wallace, 18, is among more than 3.5 million voters registered in Wisconsin, which as of the start of this month is up by about 27,000 since 2020, according to the Wisconsin Elections Commission.\n\nA freshman studying data science at the University of Utah, Wallace registered to vote for the first time in July. He said he was inspired by a high school government class, along with participation in the event, America in One Room: The Youth Vote, which gathered hundreds of first-time voters together in Washington, D.C., for a weekend this summer.\n\nWallace said he plans to vote absentee in his home state of Wisconsin and cast his ballot for Harris.\n\nWhile the college freshman opted to register just ahead of Biden\u2019s surprise exit, Wallace said the decision reaffirmed his determination to vote this fall.\n\n\u201cIt was sort of a reinvigoration of hope,\u201d he said.\n\nTurnout remains a question and concern\n\nStill for many, registration does not automatically equal participation.\n\nOut of the nearly 7 million Georgia residents registered to vote in 2022, around 4 million actually cast a ballot.\n\n'You have no choice':Trump urges voters who don't like him to consider the alternative\n\nThe numbers do improve in presidential years, though.\n\nOf the more than 8 million Michiganders registered to vote in 2020, approximately 5.5 million turned out. In Pennsylvania that year, about 9 million people were registered and almost 7 million cast a vote.\n\n\"The election will be won by those who show up, and that\u2019s where the ground game comes in,\" Murtaugh, of the Trump campaign, told Fox News.\n\nMcDonald said he expects poll numbers this November to likewise reflect growing engagement and enthusiasm.\n\n\u201cPeople who register between now and Election Day, they are doing so with an intention to vote,\u201d McDonald said.",

        "text": "Trump Campaign Hacked: How Iran, China, Russia Are Targeting US Elections\nThe grand jury in the US has indicted three Iranians on charges related to hacking and cyber espionage of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's campaign. The indictment comes in the wake of increased worries over election interference in the US by Iran, China and Russia.\n\nFederal prosecutors in the United States have today filed criminal charges in the case. The hackers had allegedly targeted members of former president Donald Trump's campaign.\n\nThe three suspects allegedly conspired with several other hackers to carry out \"a years-long, wide ranging hacking operation on behalf of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC),\" US Attorney General Merrick Garland said.\n\nThe charges pertain to an top secret Iranian cyber espionage operation that allegedly stole crucial documents related to Donald Trump's campaign. These hackers also allegedly sent these details to several journalists and key individuals associated with US President Joe Biden's re-election campaign. This was before President Joe Biden backed out and nominated his deputy - Kamala Harris - as the Democratic presidential candidate.\n\n\"The defendants' own words make clear that they were attempting to undermine former president Trump's campaign in advance of the 2024 US presidential election,\" Mr Garland said.\n\nCourt documents revealed that the hackers had \"prepared for, and engaged in a wide-ranging hacking campaign\". These include methods like spear-phishing and social engineering techniques to compromise accounts of several US government officials and individuals associated with political campaigns.\n\nA Microsoft report last month said that \"Iranian hackers had sent a spear phishing e-mail in June 2024 to a high-ranking official on Donald Trump's presidential campaign.\" In the same month Google's cybersecurity department said that \"Hackers from Iran tried to breach President Joe Biden's campaign as well.\"\n\n\"The message of the US government is clear: The American people, not a foreign power, decide the outcome of our country's elections,\" Mr Garland said.\n\nDetails on how successful these hacking attempts were, which officials were targeted, and the level of breach have not been revealed by investigating agencies.\n\nThe United States Intelligence Community or IC had said earlier this month that \"Foreign actors are increasing their election influence activities as we approach November. Our judgements on the activities of Russia, Iran, and China have not changed since our last update.\"\n\nToday's indictment is the latest in a string of federal indictments against foreign hackers that have targeted government agencies and individuals.\n\nDonald Trump's history with Iran goes far back. During his campaigns for the 2024 presidential election, Mr Trump claimed that US intelligence agencies have reportedly told him that Tehran has allegedly been plotting to assassinate him.\n\nTop security officials in the United States believe Iran has been plotting for years to assassinate Donald Trump, seeking revenge for the 2020 killing of Iran's then top General, Qasem Sulemani, who was one of the most influential figures in the country.\n\nHOW DANGEROUS IS \"IRAN'S THREAT\"\n\nThe Attorney General noted that \"there are few actors in this world that pose as grave a threat to the national security of the United States as does Iran.\"\n\nCourt documents revealed that the planning for these hacking attempts were planned as far back as 2020. They further stated that in May this year, the hackers began targeting and gaining illegal access to personal accounts of individuals linked with the US presidential campaign.\n\nThe US Treasury Department also took strong action in the case by imposing sanctions on seven Iranians, including Masoud Jalili, who was among the three hackers who were charged today.\n\nThe United States Treasury \"remains strongly committed to holding accountable those who see to undermine our institutions,\" said Bradley Smith, the current Treasury Under Secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence.\n\nBesides Jalili, the Treasury also sanctioned six staff members and executives of Iran's cybersecurity firm Emennet Pasargad. \"Between approximately August and November 2020, Emennet Pasargad led an online operation to intimidate and influence American voters, and to undermine voter confidence and sow discord,\" the Treasury stated.\n\nRUSSIAN AND CHINESE \"INTERFERENCE\"\n\nThe US has also accused Russia and China of interfering in the US presidential election, charges that both Russia and China have denied. While Donald Trump's campaign has alleged that Vladimir Putin is openly supporting Kamala Harris, based on his remarks at a televised interview, the US government has claimed that the Russian media trying to influence the US electorate.\n\nChina, it claims, is interfering too, based on who it feels would be more suitable for its own global agenda. Both Moscow and Beijing have denied these charges.\n\nThe US has accused the Chinese government of directly interfering in US's internal matters as Beijing has reportedly made repeated and ongoing attempts to polarise Americans based on domestic issues ahead of the US elections. Beijing is also accused of targeted attacks on candidates and parties.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken had in April this year said that the US has got evidence of Chinese attempts to \"influence and arguably interfere\" with the US elections.\n\n",

Sometimes she\u2019s crazy, other times she\u2019s childless but one thing is clear \u2014 she is never portrayed as someone you want to be.\n\nIn the 2024 presidential election, the archetype has played a large role on both sides of the aisle.\n\nA 2021 interview with JD Vance on Fox News, as he was running for U.S. Senate in Ohio, resurfaced a few months ago. He said that the country was being run by \u201ca bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they\u2019ve made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.\u201d\n\nAt the time he made it, the comment went fairly unchecked. Three years later when a cut from the interview entered mainstream media again, things were different. Vance was the Republican vice presidential nominee and Harris, who he previously lumped in as a \u201cchildless cat lady,\u201d was headed for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nTurn Up Your Support MPR News helps you turn down the noise and build shared understanding.

Joe Raedle | Getty Images\n\nIn 2014, Harris married the second gentleman, Doug Emhoff, and became the stepmother to Emhoff\u2019s two kids from his first marriage, Cole and Ella.\n\nIn August, Vance said the comment was \u201csarcastic\u201d and \u201ca lot of Democrats have willfully misinterpreted it\u201d in an interview with Meet the Press.\n\nBut the damage was already done. For voters it became a rallying cry. Many celebrities have also used the insult as power including Taylor Swift, Gloria Steinem and Stevie Nicks.\n\nA cat lover in the governor\u2019s office\n\nPets have played a role in previous presidential elections, but the coverage has usually gone to the dogs, like a story about Mitt Romney\u2019s family dog in the 2012 campaign or Richard Nixon\u2019s \u201cCheckers\u201d speech about the family pet in 1952 in which the vice presidential nominee salvaged his run in the new age of television.\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, is a dual pet owner. While his dog Scout has been in the news most recently when Republicans questioned his identity, the Walz family adopted their first cat Afton in 2019 from the Blue Earth Nicollet County Humane Society in Mankato.\n\nAfton Walz went missing in 2023. Screenshot via Twitter\n\nOn Aug. 26, 2023, Afton went missing from the Walz home in St. Paul. Afton was known for venturing outside, so much so he had to get an Apple AirTag.\n\nBut when he went missing, Afton somehow shed his AirTag. There have been no updates of his whereabouts since.\n\nA few months later, the Walz family welcomed Honey, who eerily looks similar to Afton. The orange tabby has a bit more white coloring than the previous first feline.\n\nWalz, a self-proclaimed cat person, responded to Vance\u2019s comments at a rally in Michigan.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as if I didn\u2019t warn these guys a few months ago: You mess with cat people, you will find out. You will find out,\u201d Walz said. \u201cThey did. Beautiful strategy there, picking on cat people.\u201d\n\nGov. Tim Walz's cat Honey sits on his computer. Courtesy photo\n\nFrom slight to signage\n\nMinnesotans took note. Beyond the myriad of Harris-Walz signs decorating lawns of the Twin Cities, a new sign design came out of Minneapolis, the city that also hosts the much-anticipated Wedge cat tour, \u201cCats for Kamala.\u201d\n\nSisters Leslie and Nina Hale placed an order for 50 yard signs shortly after Walz\u2019s comments in Michigan. They started with just friends and family and soon, everyone in their neighborhood was begging for one. They have sold about 400 signs.\n\nNina and Leslie are both cat owners and said in the beginning they thought the reclamation of the term would die down. They have a third sister, Jocey, who is allergic to cats.\n\nThey have had dog lovers come and buy signs, and they even say a self-proclaimed Republican who said while he still plans to vote for Trump, he just loves the sign.\n\nA \"Cats for Kamala\" sign in the Mac-Groveland neighborhood of St. Paul on Sept. 13. Courtesy of Claire Alberg\n\nThe Hales say they agree with Walz: Don\u2019t mess with cat people.\n\n\u201cIt is so insulting to assume that people who do not have children do not have a stake in our future, of course that is not the case,\u201d Nina said. \u201cAnd then to frame it around cats, it just adds more to the insult.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cCats for Kamala\u201d signs have been distributed on the honor system with recipients paying via Venmo. While they have enjoyed their new venture, it has been busy.\n\nNina and Leslie do not plan on ordering more \u201cCats for Kamala\u201d signs \u2014 they feel like they got their point across. They have sent the PDF of the sign design to those interested, and it can also be purchased off of Etsy.",

        "summary": " Japanese company Nippon Steel has bid to buy U.S. Steel for $15 billion . The sale has become a major issue of the 2024 presidential election . Pollution has long been a problem for residents in the Mon Valley, Pennsylvania, who live near the company's three plants .",
        "text": "In the Fight to Decide the Fate of US Steel, Climate and Public Health Take a Backseat to Politics\nWhen President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris appeared together at a rally for union members in Pittsburgh earlier this month, Harris opened her speech with a nod to the industrial legacy of a city in a key swing state for the presidential election.\n\n\u201cU.S. Steel is a historic American company, and it is vital for our country to maintain strong American steel companies,\u201d she said. \u201cU.S. Steel should remain American-owned and American-operated, and I will always have the backs of America\u2019s steelworkers.\u201d\n\nComing weeks after former President Donald Trump made a similar statement, Harris\u2019 speech was meant to stake out her position on what has become a major issue of the 2024 election: Japanese company Nippon Steel\u2019s bid to buy the Pennsylvania-based U.S. Steel for $15 billion.\n\nLost in the frenzy of national attention\u2014and missing from the presidential candidates\u2019 comments on the sale\u2014are the consequences for the environment and the thousands of residents who live downwind of U.S. Steel\u2019s three aging manufacturing facilities in western Pennsylvania.\n\nMany of those residents say they have suffered for years from the pollution generated by the plants. In Nippon Steel, an outsider to the region, residents initially saw the potential for change. Perhaps, they thought, the sale offered an opportunity to solve a generational public health problem.\n\nOne possible solution is a transition away from the coal-based type of steelmaking that U.S. Steel relies on in the Mon Valley, the area southeast of Pittsburgh where all three plants are located near the Monongahela River. Climate advocates were also optimistic about Nippon\u2019s bid, seeing in the deal the prospect of a transformative investment in the future of green steel in the United States.\n\nBut instead of producing innovative solutions, the sale has become a political drama, with pundits analyzing every move from the companies and the federal government, weighing in on the repercussions for swing state voters, union workers and foreign policy.\n\nThe candidates\u2019 and Biden\u2019s objections to the sale are unusual because the obscure committee that could sink the deal is supposed to evaluate whether the foreign acquisition of an American company poses a national security risk, and Japan is an ally. In September, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., the group conducting the national security review of the sale, granted Nippon a 90-day extension, postponing a final decision until after the election.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a wild ride so far,\u201d said Roger Smith, the Asia lead at SteelWatch, a nonprofit focused on the decarbonization of the steel industry. \u201cThis is a very strange process for a business transaction to have to go through.\u201d\n\nFor residents, the past few months have served as an ongoing reminder that the whims of politicians and businessmen who live far from the region still hold powerful sway over their future. They wonder what the Mon Valley will look like when the election and the battle for U.S. Steel is over: Will the company abandon the Mon Valley? Will it keep its operations running without investment until the mills are no longer profitable, no matter the cost to public health? If Nippon prevails, how will it treat the region\u2019s union workers and residents, and what kind of steelmaking will it champion?\n\nBecause of the global steel industry\u2019s outsized contributions to greenhouse gas emissions, the answers to these questions have implications far beyond the Mon Valley and even Pennsylvania. What happens to U.S. Steel is not just a bellwether for the election\u2014it\u2019s a portent for the planet.\n\n\u2018All Hope Has Left the Building\u2019\n\nWhen the sale was first announced in December 2023, residents were hopeful about what it could mean for pollution in the Mon Valley.\n\nPublic health advocates and residents have long fought to hold U.S. Steel accountable for the pollution its plants cause, but they have faced opposition from the company\u2019s leadership, its union, local politicians and understaffed government agencies. Some residents thought new ownership could lead to better communication with the community.\n\nThey hoped Nippon Steel, the fourth-largest steel company in the world, could do what the much smaller U.S. Steel had failed to do for decades: clean up and update the coal-based Mon Valley Works, as the three Pennsylvania sites are called collectively. The newest of the three sites opened in 1938.\n\nTwo of the 10 largest industrial emitters of air pollution in Allegheny County are owned by U.S. Steel, and one of them, the 123-year-old Clairton Coke Works, is by far the largest.\n\nSince 2020, the company has racked up millions of dollars in fines for violations of air quality standards. In January 2024, U.S. Steel agreed to a $42 million settlement to end a lawsuit filed over a 2018 fire that shut down the Coke Works\u2019 pollution control systems. The settlement included a $5 million penalty for violations of the Clean Air Act. This pollution has significant consequences for residents\u2019 health: Among the pollutants emitted by the Coke Works are cancer-causing chemicals like benzene, lead, mercury and naphthalene. Some Mon Valley communities have higher rates of asthma than other parts of Pennsylvania and elevated cancer risks. A recent report found that up to 12 percent of premature deaths in Allegheny County are attributable to current levels of fine particulate air pollution there.\n\nU.S. Steel has said in the past that it is committed to \u201csafe and environmentally responsible\u201d steelmaking and upholds \u201ca compliance rate over 99 percent and attainment with all National Ambient Air Quality Standards.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were hopeful that there could be some change because we thought that with Nippon coming in, there will be some type of public engagement,\u201d said Qiyam Ansari, the president of Valley Clean Air Now, a grassroots environmental group based in Clairton. \u201cWe thought there would be some way of having a seat at the table, which is what we haven\u2019t had.\u201d\n\nThat hoped-for communication\u2014or any concrete, forward-looking vision for the Mon Valley Works\u2014has not materialized. Instead, residents have watched the drama between Nippon, U.S. Steel and the federal government from the sidelines, with little say in the process or outcome.\n\n\u201cMost folks feel like we\u2019ve become a political bargaining chip.\u201d \u2014 Qiyam Ansari, Valley Clean Air Now president\n\n\u201cPeople are being treated like pawns, and no one\u2019s really listening to voices of the community for what they need,\u201d said Matt Mehalik, the executive director at Breathe Project, a coalition of residents, academics and environmental advocates that is based in southwestern Pennsylvania and focused on improving air quality. Mehalik said the back-and-forth of the deal discussions is taking a toll on Mon Valley residents and workers as they wonder what will happen to their towns and jobs. \u201cThe high-profile and volatile corporate sale process induces very high levels of community stress,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere hasn\u2019t been any sort of community meeting, and there\u2019s no mention whatsoever about improvement in terms of air quality or water quality,\u201d said Edith Abeyta, an artist and activist who lives in North Braddock, not far from U.S. Steel\u2019s Edgar Thomson Works, and is a member of an advocacy group for residents in her town, North Braddock Residents for Our Future. \u201cNo one\u2019s saying the things that I\u2019m interested in hearing. There\u2019s no one coming to the table and saying, \u2018We want to buy U.S. Steel and we\u2019re going to clean it up.\u2019\u201d\n\nAnsari said his organization tried to reach Nippon to express concerns about what the sale would mean for local communities, but received no response. \u201cIt\u2019s just been radio silence,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re operating in the same old industrial playbook where they only speak to the elected officials, they control them and there\u2019s no engagement with the public.\u201d\n\nAnsari said residents were disheartened by the spectacle of the sale. \u201cMost folks feel like we\u2019ve become a political bargaining chip,\u201d he said. \u201cAll hope has left the building.\u201d\n\nThough they\u2019ve often been at odds with environmentalists, in part because many U.S. Steel workers don\u2019t live close to the mills, United Steelworkers union members feel similarly left out of the conversation. U.S. Steel\u2019s Pennsylvania facilities employ about 3,000 union workers. The union opposes the deal, arguing that it will harm workers and America\u2019s national defense and critical supply chains.\n\nOn August 28, Nippon announced what it called \u201ctransformative investments\u201d in the Mon Valley Works and the Gary Works in Indiana. The announcement included $1 billion to be invested in the Mon Valley.\n\n\u201cNippon Steel plans to ensure Mon Valley Works operates for decades to come and will undertake the necessary investments so that it remains viable and provides jobs for future generations of steelworkers in Pennsylvania,\u201d the company said.\n\n\u201cThey never contacted us. They didn\u2019t talk to us about it ahead of time,\u201d Bernie Hall, the Steelworkers\u2019 District 10 director, who represents USW members in Pennsylvania, said of Nippon\u2019s announcement.\n\nUSW has had a contentious relationship with U.S. Steel since David Burritt became the CEO in 2017, and the protracted negotiations over this deal have only increased the tension, with Burritt threatening earlier this month to close the Mon Valley mills and relocate the company\u2019s headquarters to the U.S. South if the sale fails to go through. Hall does not trust Nippon\u2019s commitment to keeping U.S. Steel\u2019s unionized facilities open or not to lay off union workers. He fears that Nippon could use its planned \u201ctransformative investments\u201d against the union in future contract negotiations.\n\nBernie Hall, the District 10 Director for the United Steelworkers, poses outside the U.S. Steel Mon Valley Works in Braddock on June 4.

We want the necessary investments put into it so they remain competitive and operational for years to come,\u201d Hall said. \u201cTheir promises have been very hollow.\u201d\n\nNippon Steel did not respond to requests for comment, but a statement on a website created to promote the sale highlighted the company\u2019s \u201csincere and persistent dedication to developing and maintaining a trust-based productive dialogue and addressing any concerns that the USW members and leadership have.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe goal of this transaction is to protect and grow U. S. Steel, and its union and non-union employees are critical to that goal,\u201d it said.\n\nU.S. Steel has called on Pennsylvanian politicians to \u201crecognize significant benefits of the transaction,\u201d including protecting jobs, tax revenue and the company\u2019s local charitable donations, as well as \u201cthe unavoidable consequences if the deal fails.\u201d In a statement to Inside Climate News about the sale, a U.S. Steel media representative said one of the \u201ctop benefits\u201d of the deal is \u201cthe investment and opportunities it provides for all employees.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany people profess to want what is best for our employees, and that is why we negotiated a deal with a partner who will bring $2.7 billion of transformative investments in USW-represented facilities, keeping them in operation for decades to come,\u201d said the spokesperson, Andrew Fulton. \u201cThere is no scenario where U. S. Steel would make these investments absent Nippon Steel.\u201d The $2.7 billion includes investment in the Gary Works in Indiana.\n\nThe statement did not include any information about the sale\u2019s impact on public health or the communities near U.S. Steel facilities.\n\nNippon\u2019s promises remind many people in the Mon Valley of U.S. Steel\u2019s. In 2019, U.S. Steel said it would invest $1 billion to \u201ctransform\u201d the Mon Valley\u2019s Clairton Coke Works and the Edgar Thomson Works into \u201cthe most innovative steel mill in the United States of America.\u201d Two years later, the company canceled the project, citing delays caused by the pandemic and changing business conditions \u201cin a rapidly decarbonizing world.\u201d (In 2021, U.S. Steel committed to reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.)\n\nInstead of investing in Pennsylvania, U.S. Steel pledged to spend $3 billion to build its \u201cmost advanced steelmaking facility in North America\u201d in Arkansas at a non-union site. At the time, the union demanded that Burritt \u201cstop running away from our communities, jobs and Union!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re constantly being told there\u2019s nothing wrong, it\u2019s not a problem and if you don\u2019t like it, you should just move away.\u201d \u2014 Edith Abeyta, North Braddock resident\n\nAbeyta remembers U.S. Steel pitching its version of a \u201ctransformative investment\u201d to residents in 2019, holding meetings and talking about what the proposed changes would look like. Looking at Nippon\u2019s pitch in 2024, she\u2019s unconvinced. \u201cIt\u2019s public posturing,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been almost 150 years now that Edgar Thomson has been there. It\u2019s never been on the side of the people that live adjacent to it. Its priority isn\u2019t the health and safety and prosperity of the people that live adjacent to it,\u201d she said. In Braddock, 30 percent of the population lives below the poverty line, compared to just under 11 percent in the Pittsburgh metro area. The town has lost more than 90 percent of its population since the 20th century, a collapse driven by declines in manufacturing jobs and white flight. About 30 percent of Braddock\u2019s homes are vacant.\n\nAbeyta said living near Edgar Thomson Works is like \u201cbeing gaslit 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re constantly being told there\u2019s nothing wrong, it\u2019s not a problem and if you don\u2019t like it, you should just move away,\u201d she said. For most residents, moving away is not an option, especially as housing prices in other parts of southwestern Pennsylvania have increased.\n\nAs U.S. Steel invested in Arkansas, its facilities in Pennsylvania have languished. \u201cThe latest investments occurred in the 1980s,\u201d Mehalik said of the Edgar Thomson Works, noting that some of the manufacturing components at the Clairton Coke Works date to the Truman administration. This neglect is a major reason for the high levels of air pollution in the county, he said.\n\nToward Decarbonization\n\nU.S. Steel\u2019s impact on the environment isn\u2019t limited to Allegheny County. It also has a significant impact on Pennsylvania\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. In 2020, the industrial sector in Pennsylvania was responsible for 31 percent of the state\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions, the largest contributor. According to a report last year from Penn Environment, 12 industrial facilities emitted 17 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions in 2021. Nearly a quarter of that total came from U.S. Steel\u2019s Edgar Thomson Works.\n\nThe global steel industry contributes about 11 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, which is a \u201chuge number from one industry,\u201d said Hilary Lewis, steel director at Industrious Labs, an organization whose mission is to decarbonize heavy industry. Seventy percent of steel globally is made using coal. In the U.S., that figure is flipped. Only 30 percent of American steel is made with coal. (The other 70 percent is made from recycled scrap steel in what are called electric arc furnaces.) But Lewis said those few coal-based facilities account for 73 percent of the U.S. steel industry\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nA view of U.S Steel\u2019s Edgar Thomson Works and the town of North Braddock.

Months ago, they too were optimistic about the possibility of Nippon\u2019s ownership. They hoped the company would use the sale as a chance to learn about \u201cstate of the art, low-emission steelmaking\u201d from the work being done at U.S. Steel\u2019s Arkansas facility, said Smith, the steel analyst based in Tokyo. He said the question was whether Nippon would take advantage of access to American renewable energy and hydrogen investments to \u201ccreate a new generation of green steelmaking,\u201d or if it was \u201cgoing to continue what it\u2019s been doing in Japan, which is just running polluting coal-based blast furnaces for as long as it can.\u201d\n\nIn late August, with Nippon\u2019s investment announcement, the answer seemed clearer. The company had decided to keep going in the same direction that it had been before the sale: coal-based steelmaking, a legacy it shares with U.S. Steel. \u201cNippon Steel is actually not that different than U.S. Steel,\u201d Smith said. \u201cTheir fleet of facilities is similar.\u201d\n\nThe website explaining the benefits of the sale says it would \u201cdrive the global steel industry towards decarbonization and a sustainable world,\u201d while maintaining U.S. Steel\u2019s Pittsburgh headquarters and \u201caccelerating innovation, decarbonization and digitization at U. S. Steel.\u201d It would be \u201ca positive development for American steel, American jobs and America\u2019s national security\u201d that would help both companies move \u201ctoward carbon neutrality and our shared commitment of decarbonization by 2050.\u201d\n\nBut Nippon\u2019s recent investment announcement seemed not to support those claims. It\u2019s offering to pay for a series of repairs necessary to keep the facilities running on coal, Lewis said. The proposed investments in Gary Works in Indiana would extend the life of the blast furnace for 15 to 20 more years. \u201cIt\u2019s a lock-in for pollution,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re investing in more coal. That\u2019s the exact opposite of a climate-friendly investment.\u201d\n\nSaid Smith: \u201cThat was the first time that I began to feel that maybe this is the old Nippon Steel. This could be decades more of coal use and heavy climate pollution, as well as air pollution affecting communities. What I didn\u2019t see in this announcement was anything innovative or novel.\u201d\n\nSmith fears what might happen if Nippon decides to go all in on extending the life of U.S. Steel\u2019s coal-based facilities. \u201cNippon Steel has a lot more resources than U.S. Steel does, and it has global operations, and if it decides that coal-based steelmaking in the U.S. has a bright future and makes investments to that effect, then people in the U.S. are going to pay the price for that for decades to come,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lock-in for pollution. They\u2019re investing in more coal. That\u2019s the exact opposite of a climate-friendly investment.\u201d \u2014 Hilary Lewis, Industrious Labs steel director\n\nSmith said conditions in the U.S. are \u201creally favorable\u201d for green steelmaking and there is a much more uncertain economic future for the old way of doing things, something that U.S. Steel has long known. The Mon Valley plants are still profitable, but eventually they will need hugely expensive upgrades to keep running\u2014upgrades the company has resisted making.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a reason that U.S. Steel stopped making big investments in its old coal-based steelmaking facilities, and it\u2019s because they didn\u2019t really see much of a future in it,\u201d Smith said. If the sale is blocked and no other buyer steps forward, it seems likely that the Mon Valley Works will eventually close. \u201cI don\u2019t see how it would be economically competitive, and it would just blow a hole in any kind of carbon budget that the U.S. has.\u201d\n\nAlthough closing the Mon Valley Works would be positive from a climate perspective, that was not the outcome that Lewis and others who work on green steel were hoping for.\n\n\u201cWhat climate advocates want to see happen here is an investment in clean facilities,\u201d Lewis said. Experts eager for the American steel industry to decarbonize want U.S. Steel to embrace technologies like direct reduced iron combined with green hydrogen, which can reduce emissions from steelmaking by more than 90 percent.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a technology problem,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a resource availability challenge.\u201d\n\nThat challenge could be solved with more investments in hydrogen infrastructure like the Inflation Reduction Act, so long as those projects supported heavy industry and not other uses that could run on renewable energy without hydrogen. These technologies \u201care an opportunity for the industry to reinvent itself,\u201d Lewis said, pointing to past innovations in steelmaking that had been successfully adopted.\n\nA worker leaves U.S. Steel\u2019s Edgar Thomson Steel Works in 2018. Credit: Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nLewis criticized Burritt for his threats to move the company to the South and for wasting the opportunity to truly transform the Mon Valley Works, which she said could cost between $1.6 billion and $3 billion, a massive investment but one that is not dissimilar to Nippon\u2019s $1.4 billion capital commitment.\n\n\u201cThreatening workers with their jobs and livelihoods is not the path forward,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need a future where union labor is respected, where the people who have expertise in steelmaking, which is union workers, are leading this transition.\u201d\n\nLewis said she saw the sale as a chance for labor and environmental interests to work together for the common good of residents, workers and the climate. If the union were to join environmentalists in fighting for a decarbonized U.S. Steel, that could be a \u201cpowerful coalition.\u201d She said investing in green steelmaking would be the most effective way of ensuring that the union\u2019s workers are protected for the long-term, which is USW\u2019s ultimate goal.\n\nLast year, the Ohio River Valley Institute published a study looking at what green steelmaking could mean for the Mon Valley\u2019s economy and climate impacts. The study concluded that transitioning away from steelmaking powered by fossil fuels could result in up to 43 percent more jobs in the sector by 2031 and a decrease in carbon dioxide equivalent emissions of 4 million metric tons per year.\n\nIn a perfect universe, Valley Clean Air Now\u2019s Ansari said, an agreement between labor, residents and the companies might have produced something new and modern that could have rivaled U.S. Steel in its heyday, when it was celebrated as America\u2019s first billion-dollar company and became an enduring symbol of Pittsburgh and southwestern Pennsylvania.\n\nThis story is funded by readers like you. Our nonprofit newsroom provides award-winning climate coverage free of charge and advertising. We rely on donations from readers like you to keep going. Please donate now to support our work. Donate Now\n\n\u201cThe best steel in the world was made right here in the Mon Valley,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that could be something that we could actually claim.\u201d Ultimately, Ansari said, the warring factions with a stake in U.S. Steel have failed to come to an agreement that could save union jobs, make them environmentally friendly and transform the Mon Valley for the better.\n\nThat leaves a real possibility that the company will leave the Mon Valley, and he is worried about the economic fallout. Other towns in southwestern Pennsylvania that have seen their manufacturing hubs and steel mills close over the past 40 years have struggled to recover.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be able to breathe easier, but there\u2019s going to be some long-term downwind effects that are going to take decades to fix,\u201d he said. His organization is preparing for this outcome, which he sees as increasingly likely. \u201cIf U.S. Steel decides to leave, we are trying to be a bright spot and think about how the community can stay resilient and bounce back.\u201d\n\nPast Harms, Future Visions\n\nResidents see connections between their story and the stories of other forgotten manufacturing towns that have long relied on fossil fuels to power heavy industry, not just domestically but abroad.\n\nMehalik of Breathe Project recalled attending an international steel conference this year and meeting a man from South Korea who talked about the toll on health and the environment a coal-based steelmaking facility had taken on his village over decades of operation. Now there was discussion about whether the mill should be closed. To Mehalik, whose family is from Braddock and whose grandfather worked at Edgar Thomson, this history sounded eerily familiar.\n\n\u201cTheir story starts 50 or 60 years later than what we have in Pittsburgh, but the stories start to sound the same when you run the tape long enough,\u201d Mehalik said.\n\n\u201cThe Mon Valley is not the only community that is having to go through this,\u201d said Abeyta, the North Braddock resident. She has been thinking about the Gary Works in Indiana, and \u201cpeople in other parts of the country who are not as much of a focus in the news because they\u2019re not in a swing state.\u201d\n\nMehalik, who has met recently with people who live near Gary Works, agreed: \u201cThose communities have the same story.\u201d\n\nIf coal-based steelmaking eventually disappears, that transition will affect communities in the United States and around the world. Navigating the industry\u2019s transition away from fossil fuels without harming workers and communities is daunting, and it will require more than money and technological expertise to tackle.\n\nIn 2022, students at Carnegie Mellon University collaborated with residents in Braddock and North Braddock on a project called \u201cPast Harms, Future Visions.\u201d The project sought to imagine \u201cjust urban futures\u201d for Braddock and its citizens, including reimagining the Edgar Thomson Works, which has been in operation since 1875. In one plan, students illustrated the 250-acre site along the Monongahela River reborn as a green steel mill, surrounded by walking trails, a library and solar panels. The once closed-off riverfront is open to the public, the town is revitalized and the land has been restored.\n\nVisualizing a cleaner, safer and more equitable future is more important, and far more challenging, than it might seem. Even Abeyta, who was part of the Carnegie Mellon project, finds it difficult to envision the Mon Valley that exists in the students\u2019 renderings.\n\n\u201cI know there\u2019s talk about green steel and decarbonization. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s possible,\u201d she said. \u201cIs it possible to imagine a world that doesn\u2019t exist with these harmful processes? Is it possible for us to even think about living in a world that isn\u2019t dependent on fossil fuels and extractions?\u201d\n\nWhat Nippon Steel\u2014and by extension, the global steel industry\u2014lacks is not the means to make the students\u2019 dream of green steelmaking in the Mon Valley a reality. What\u2019s missing, in fact, might be imagination.\n\n\u201c[Nippon has] the technical ability and the financial wherewithal to do so if they chose,\u201d Smith said. \u201cBut do they have the vision?\u201d\n\nAbout This Story Perhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read.

        "summary": " China taps into AI to ramp up fake-news campaign amid U.S. election . Beijing's sprawling effort to reshape global perceptions is costing many billions per year . China\u2019s operations have caught the attention of intelligence analysts and policymakers in Washington .",
        "text": "China taps into AI to ramp up fake-news campaign amid U.S. election\nWhen veteran U.S. diplomat Kurt Campbell traveled to the Solomon Islands to counter Beijing\u2019s influence in the South Pacific country, he quickly saw just how far China would go to spread its message.\n\nThe Biden administration\u2019s Asia czar woke up one morning in 2022 to a long article in the local press about the U.S. running chemical and biological labs in Ukraine, a claim that Washington calls an outright lie. Started by Russia, the false and incendiary claim was vigorously amplified by China\u2019s vast overseas propaganda apparatus.\n\nIt was another example of \u201cclearly effective Russian and Chinese disinformation,\u201d Campbell told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in July.\n\nTwo years later, the claim still reverberates online, demonstrating China\u2019s sprawling effort to reshape global perceptions. The campaign, costing many billions per year, is becoming ever more sophisticated thanks to artificial intelligence. China\u2019s operations have caught the attention of intelligence analysts and policymakers in Washington, who vow to combat any actions that could influence the November election or undermine American interests.\n\nThe key tactic: networks of websites purporting to be legitimate news outlets, delivering pro-China coverage that often parallels official statements and positions from Beijing.\n\nShannon Van Sant, an adviser to the Committee for Freedom in Hong Kong Foundation, tracked a network of dozens of sites that posed as news organizations. One site mimicked The New York Times, using a similar font and design in what she called an attempt at legitimacy. The site carried strongly pro-Chinese messages.\n\nWhen Van Sant researched the site\u2019s reporters she found no information. Their names didn\u2019t belong to any known journalists working in China, and their photos bore telltale signs of being created with AI.\n\n\u201cManipulation of the media is ultimately a manipulation of readers and the audience, and this is damaging to democracy and society,\u201d Van Sant said.\n\nLiu Pengyu, spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in the U.S., said allegations that China uses news websites and social media to spread pro-Beijing information and influence public opinion in the U.S. \u201care full of malicious speculations against China, which China firmly opposes.\u201d\n\nIn addition to its state media, Beijing has turned to foreign players \u2014 real or not \u2014 to relay messages and lend credibility to narratives favoring the Communist Party, said Xiao Qiang, a research scientist at the School of Information at the University of California, Berkeley. Xiao also is editor-in-chief of China Digital Times, a bilingual news website that aggregates information from and about China.\n\nBeijing\u2019s methods are wide-ranging and links to the government are often difficult to prove, Xiao said. But whether it\u2019s journalists with American-sounding names or an Indian influencer, the consistently pro-Beijing messages give them away.\n\n\u201cThe implicit message is the same \u2014 that the Chinese Communist Party works for its people,\u201d Xiao said.\n\nAnalysts at the cybersecurity firm Logically identified 1,200 websites that had carried Russian or Chinese state media stories. The sites often target specific audiences and have names that sound like traditional news organizations or defunct newspapers.\n\nUnlike Russia or Iran, which have displayed clear preferences in the U.S. presidential campaign, Beijing is more cautious and focused on spreading positive content about China.\n\nWhile the sites aren\u2019t owned by China, they run Chinese content. When Logically looked at content specifically about the U.S. election, 20% could be traced back to Chinese or Russian state media.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a decent likelihood that these articles could influence U.S. audiences without them even knowing where it comes from,\u201d said Alex Nelson, Logically\u2019s senior manager for strategy and analysis.\n\nAccording to the Gallup World Poll, more countries surveyed view the U.S. positively, but the share of countries where views of both the U.S. and China are negative overall is higher than 15 years ago, signaling the U.S. doesn\u2019t appear to be making gains over China.\n\nSome U.S. officials want to increase spending to even the playing field. The House of Representatives this month approved a bill that would authorize $325 million annually through 2027 to counter China\u2019s global influence, including its disinformation campaigns. The measure still needs Senate approval.\n\n\u201cWe are in a global competition for influence with China, and if you want to win it, then you cannot do it on a middle-power budget,\u201d said Rep. Gregory Meeks, a Democrat from New York.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping has demanded a systematic buildup of Chinese narratives that would give his country a global voice \u201ccommensurate with\u201d its international stature.\n\nBeijing has invested in state media such as the Xinhua news agency and China Central Television to convey its messages to global audiences in various languages and platforms. Media groups at the local level are creating \u201cinternational communication centers\u201d to build an overseas presence with websites, news channels and social media accounts.\n\nBeijing also has struck media partnerships worldwide, and the article Campbell read in the Solomon Islands is likely a result of those.\n\nChina\u2019s outreach is tied to the global race for economic dominance in electric vehicles, computer chips, AI and quantum computing, said Jaret Riddick, a senior fellow at Georgetown University\u2019s Center for Security and Emerging Technology.\n\n\u201cThe countries that lead on emerging technologies will be the countries that have a great advantage going forward,\u201d Riddick said.\n\nTo tell its story, Beijing has not shied away from using fake personas. A 2023 State Department report detailed the case of a published writer named Yi Fan, originally described as a Chinese foreign ministry analyst. Yi morphed into a journalist, then became an independent analyst.\n\nYi\u2019s details changed, but the message did not. Through published commentaries and writings, Yi trumpeted close ties between China and Africa, praised Beijing\u2019s approach to environmental sustainability and argued that China must counter distorted Western narratives.\n\nThen there was Wilson Edwards, a supposed Swiss virologist quoted in Chinese media as a COVID-19 expert who criticized the U.S. response. But Swiss officials found no evidence he existed.\n\n\u201cIf you exist, we would like to meet you!\u201d the Swiss Embassy in Beijing wrote on social media.",

        "text": "What\u2019s at stake for health care reform in the US election?\nIn the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), Oberlander tackles these policy issues in a new Perspective piece titled \u201cHealth Care Reform and the 2024 U.S. Elections \u2014 Low Visibility, High Stakes.\u201d Oberlander is a professor and chair in UNC\u2019s Department of Social Medicine and a professor of health policy and management at the UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health.\n\nBy Rachel Morrow, Gillings School communications fellow\n\nWhile abortion and reproductive health care are in the spotlight during the 2024 United States presidential campaign, other health policy issues, including Medicare and Medicaid, have drawn less attention. Despite this low visibility, the election will have significant implications for the future of health care reform, according to health policy expert Jonathan Oberlander, PhD.\n\nIn the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), Oberlander tackles these policy issues in a new Perspective piece titled \u201cHealth Care Reform and the 2024 U.S. Elections \u2014 Low Visibility, High Stakes.\u201d Oberlander is a professor and chair in UNC\u2019s Department of Social Medicine and a professor of health policy and management at the UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health.\n\nDue to the prominence of other issues, such as the economy and immigration, as well as the success of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), neither Democrats nor Republicans have offered sweeping reform plans for health care in their presidential campaigns. Oberlander says that health care policy has returned to incrementalism, with a focus on small changes rather than broad transformation. The ACA has been both successful and popular, with 24 million Americans enrolled in Medicaid thanks to the ACA\u2019s provision for Medicaid expansion and 21 million who have obtained insurance through the ACA\u2019s insurance marketplace. More than 60% of Americans now view the law favorably.\n\nOberlander lays out some potential health policy paths that Republicans could take if Donald Trump wins the presidency and the GOP gains Congressional majorities. Pursuing full repeal of the ACA would be politically risky. Instead, Republicans could seek to eliminate specific ACA policies and loosen insurance market regulations. A Trump administration could also choose not to extend premium subsidies for ACA plans that are due to expire in 2026. Republicans could additionally pursue plans to reduce federal funding for Medicaid, revive work requirements for Medicaid enrollees and repeal Medicare\u2019s ability to negotiate some drug prices.\n\nIn contrast, if Kamala Harris is elected president, Oberlander says her administration would seek to build on the ACA. It could pursue policies to control prescription drug costs and provide medical debt relief. Democrats could also seek to close the coverage gap for low-income persons living in states that have not expanded Medicaid and extend the ACA\u2019s enhanced premium subsidies. During the campaign, Harris has not embraced two reforms that Democrats have previously proposed: creating a new government insurance plan (a \u201cpublic option\u201d) and lowering Medicare\u2019s eligibility age from 65 to 60\n\nWhile health care reform has not received much attention in this election, Oberlander says the stakes remain high and a partisan divide persists over whether to continue building on the ACA\u2019s success or adopt policies that would jeopardize its coverage gains.\n\nRead the full Perspective piece in NEJM.",

        "text": "A List Of Important Dates In 2024 US Presidential Election\nRepublican former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, a Democrat, will face each other in the Nov. 5 U.S. presidential election.\n\nHere is a timeline of events related to the election between now and Inauguration Day next January.\n\n- Oct. 1: Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance and Democratic rival Tim Walz will take part in a debate hosted by CBS News.\n\n- Nov. 5: Election Day\n\n- Later in November: It could take days for the election result to be known, especially if it is close and mail-in ballots are a factor.\n\n- Nov. 26: Trump, the first sitting or former U.S. president to be convicted of a crime, is due to be sentenced in the Manhattan hush money case where he was found guilty of falsifying documents to cover up a payment to silence a porn star. Trump has denied wrongdoing and sentencing was originally due to take place on Sept. 18.\n\n- Dec. 17: Electors, who together form the Electoral College, meet in their respective states or the District of Columbia to select the president and vice president.\n\n- Dec. 25: The electoral votes must be received by the president of the Senate - a role held by the vice president, currently Harris - and the archivist by this date.\n\n2025\n\n- Jan. 6: The vice president presides over the Electoral College vote count at a joint session of Congress, announces the results and declares who has been elected.\n\nAhead of the count on Jan. 6, 2021, Trump lambasted his vice president, Mike Pence, for refusing to try to prevent Congress from certifying Biden's win. On that day, the U.S. Capitol was attacked by Trump supporters trying to stop the count. Biden's win was certified early the next day.\n\nCongress has since passed the Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act of 2022, which requires approval of one-fifth of the House and Senate to consider a challenge to a state's results - a much higher bar than existed before, when any single lawmaker from each chamber could trigger a challenge.\n\n- Jan. 20: The inauguration of the election winner and their vice president takes place. At this ceremony, the victor and the vice president are officially sworn into office.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "U.S. government unveils charges against Iranians who hacked into Trump 2024 campaign \u2022 Ohio Capital Journal\nWASHINGTON \u2014 U.S. law enforcement on Friday announced charges against three Iranians who allegedly stole materials from former President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign and tried to pass them to news media and Democrats in an attempt to influence the 2024 election.\n\nThe Department of Justice unsealed the indictment detailing a yearslong hacking scheme by Iran that targeted the email accounts of U.S. government officials, journalists, think tank experts, and most recently the 2024 presidential campaigns.\n\n\u201cThe defendants\u2019 own words make clear that they were attempting to undermine former President Trump\u2019s campaign in advance of the 2024 U.S. presidential election,\u201d Attorney General Merrick Garland said at a Friday press conference. Prosecutors believe the defendants acted from Iran and were never in the U.S.\n\n\u201cWe know that Iran is continuing its brazen efforts to stoke discord, erode confidence in the U.S. electoral process and advance its malign activities for the (Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps), a designated foreign terrorist organization,\u201d Garland said.\n\nThe unsealed indictment in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia came three days after Trump\u2019s campaign revealed the former president was briefed by the U.S. intelligence officials about \u201creal and specific threats from Iran to assassinate him,\u201d according to a statement Tuesday from Steven Cheung, the campaign\u2019s communications director.\n\n\u201cBig threats on my life by Iran,\u201d Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, posted on X Wednesday. Trump suggested at a campaign stop in Mint Hill, North Carolina, that Iran could be responsible for two assassination attempts on him.\n\nThe U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence has not published a statement on the matter. Its most recent press release focuses on the Iranian plot to hack Trump\u2019s campaign.\n\n\u2018It takes two to tango\u2019\n\nGlobal politics continued to top the U.S. presidential election headlines Friday when Trump welcomed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to Trump Tower after announcing the invitation late Thursday at a meandering press conference where he promised, if elected, to strike a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia \u201cquite quickly.\u201d\n\nThe pair met behind closed doors in Trump\u2019s New York City skyscraper on the sidelines of this week\u2019s United Nations General Assembly, and one day after Zelenskyy traveled to Washington to meet with Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, President Joe Biden and bipartisan lawmakers.\n\n\u201cAfter November we have to decide, and we hope that the strengths of the United States will be very strong, and we count on it. That\u2019s why I decided to meet with both candidates,\u201d Zelenskyy said during brief joint comments alongside Trump ahead of the meeting.\n\nTrump, who refused during a live presidential debate to say whether he wanted Ukraine to win its war with Russia, detoured from that stance and hinted Friday that he wants a victory for the Western ally.\n\n\u201cI think the fact that we\u2019re even together today is a very good sign, and hopefully we\u2019ll have a good victory, because (if) the other side wins, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re gonna have victories with anything to be honest with you,\u201d Trump said during the joint remarks.\n\nDuring the exchange, Trump highlighted his \u201cvery good relationship\u201d with Putin and said he could settle the war \u201cvery quickly.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you know, it takes two to tango,\u201d he said.\n\nHarris at the border\n\nHarris traveled to the U.S. southern border Friday to stump for a bipartisan border security deal that collapsed in early 2024 shortly after Trump publicly lambasted it.\n\nHarris was scheduled to deliver what her campaign billed as a major speech in the border town of Douglas, Arizona, where she planned to talk about setting and enforcing new immigration rules at the border, according to a senior campaign official.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump cares more about self-interest than solutions. He wants a problem to run on, not a fix for the American people,\u201d Harris campaign spokesperson Ammar Moussa said in a statement Friday.\n\n\u201cWhen he was president, Trump created chaos at the border, taking our already broken immigration system and making it worse \u2013 leaving behind a mess for the Biden-Harris administration to clean up. Americans deserve a president who puts national security over their own self-interest \u2013 that\u2019s Kamala Harris,\u201d the statement continued.\n\nTrump is attacking Harris over border crossings into the U.S. \u2014 his central campaign issue \u2014 and calling her by the dishonest nickname \u201cborder czar\u201d and claiming she caused the \u201cworst border crisis in the history of the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the four years that have taken place after being named \u2018border czar,\u2019 Kamala Harris will be visiting the southern border that she has completely destroyed,\u201d Trump said at his Thursday press conference.\n\nBiden, in February 2021, tasked Harris with strategizing ways to fight the \u201croot cause\u201d of migration from Central American countries, including economic insecurity, government corruption and gender-based violence.\n\nTrump has historically painted with a broad brush the complex issue of immigration at the U.S. southern border, announcing his first presidential campaign in 2015 by describing Mexican immigrants as \u201crapists.\u201d During his own presidency in 2018 he warned of immigrant \u201ccaravans\u201d crossing into the U.S. from Mexico. He has promised mass deportations if elected in November.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security publicly releases numbers of border encounters, apprehensions and expulsions.",

        "text": "Five Things to Know: Healthcare and the U.S. Election\nEditor's Note: This research was conducted in partnership with West Health, a family of nonprofit and nonpartisan organizations focused on healthcare and aging.\n\nWASHINGTON, D.C. -- Healthcare issues, especially those related to cost of and access to care, are an important top-of-mind policy area for many American voters. Yet, a new poll from West Health and Gallup shows that a majority of Americans say healthcare is not receiving enough attention in the 2024 presidential campaign so far. The upcoming vice presidential debate presents a unique opportunity for the two campaigns to address these concerns and lay out their plans for healthcare policy.\n\nThe findings reported here are from a study fielded Sept. 9-16 via web using the Gallup Panel, with 2,398 respondents surveyed before the Sept. 10 presidential debate and 1,262 surveyed after it, for a total of 3,660 respondents. Attitudes reported here did not vary significantly for respondents interviewed before and after the debate.\n\n1. Two in three Americans -- including majorities of both political parties -- say healthcare is not receiving enough attention during the presidential campaign so far.\n\nOverall, 67% of U.S. adults say healthcare is not receiving enough attention during the 2024 presidential campaign, while 6% say it is getting too much attention and 27% the right amount. Democrats and independents are more likely than Republicans to say healthcare is not getting enough attention during the current presidential campaign. That said, more than half of Republicans (53%) agree that it is not getting enough attention.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nAmong the respondents who said they watched the presidential debate on Sept. 10, similar numbers (71%) report that the candidates did not spend enough time on healthcare-related issues during the debate. This attitude is held by 77% of Democrats, 74% of independents and 57% of Republicans who watched the debate.\n\n2. While independents are slightly more trusting of Harris than Trump when it comes to acting on key healthcare issues, about a third report not trusting either candidate.\n\nAmericans\u2019 levels of trust in the presidential candidates to tackle key issues related to cost and quality of healthcare fall along political party lines, with solid majorities of Republicans saying Donald Trump is more trusted to handle the issues and the vast majority of Democrats saying Kamala Harris is. Political independents are slightly more likely to report trusting Harris over Trump on these healthcare issues. This is especially true when it comes to improving access to care and insurance coverage as well as protecting or strengthening Medicare. On these two topics, independents are more than 10 points more likely to say they trust Harris over Trump.\n\nAbout a third or more of independents report they don\u2019t trust either candidate across all the healthcare issues polled, suggesting that a significant portion of potential swing voters are cynical in how they feel about both candidates on healthcare.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\n3. Nearly half of Americans report that a candidate\u2019s position on lowering drug costs and mental healthcare policy are important issues in determining their vote in the upcoming election.\n\nA candidate\u2019s position on protecting Medicare and Social Security is the single most or among the most important healthcare-related issues in determining 63% of Americans\u2019 vote in the upcoming presidential election, while a candidate\u2019s position on lowering the cost of healthcare (57%) is close behind.\n\nThe importance of a candidate\u2019s position on mental healthcare (43%) is near the same level of importance as reducing drug costs (47%) as the single most or among the most important issues determining their vote. This mirrors Americans\u2019 broader dissatisfaction with this issue area, as 73% say the government is not doing enough to ensure the public has access to affordable mental healthcare.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\n4. Protecting Medicare and lowering drug costs are among the most important issues older Americans care about when determining their vote.\n\nThe importance of certain healthcare issues to a person\u2019s vote differs among older versus younger Americans. Americans 65 and older are much more likely than those 18 to 49 to say a candidate\u2019s positions on protecting Medicare and Social Security and lowering drug costs are among the most important issues or the single most important issue in determining their vote. Conversely, younger and older voters place about equal importance on a candidate\u2019s positions on lowering healthcare costs and their mental healthcare policies.\n\nDemocrats are more likely than Republicans and independents to say that various healthcare-related issues are at least among the most important when determining their vote in the upcoming election. Independents fall roughly between Republicans and Democrats when it comes to the importance of these issues.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nAge differences are apparent within the party groups. On the issue of protecting Medicare and Social Security, 74% of Republicans over 65, and 68% of those 50 to 64, say this is the single most or among the most important issues determining their vote, compared with 40% of Republicans 18 to 49. Similarly, 94% of Democrats 65 and older, and 85% of those aged 50 to 64, say this is the single most or among the most important issues, compared with 58% of Democrats 18 to 49. Independents follow the same pattern.\n\n5. Democrats are much more optimistic than Republicans and independents about improving access to affordable healthcare in the next five years.\n\nThe most recent numbers from the West Health-Gallup Healthcare Affordability Index show that just over half of the American public say they can pay for medicine or healthcare if they needed it today, declining from a high of 61% in 2022.\n\nWhen asked how likely it is that access to affordable healthcare will improve in the next five years, Democrats express optimism, while Republicans and independents are pessimistic. Fifty-eight percent of Democrats believe access is very or somewhat likely to improve, while majorities of Republicans (70%) and independents (64%) say improvement is not very or not at all likely.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nImplications\n\nAmericans want more attention paid to lowering healthcare costs, an issue that has not had as much visibility in this presidential campaign compared with previous ones. This is especially true for Americans aged 65 and older. Majorities of older Republicans and older Democrats say a candidate\u2019s plan for protecting Medicare and Social Security is crucial to their vote choice.\n\nThe 65 and older population is a significant voting bloc in the U.S. In 2020, the population of Americans 65 and older reached a high of 55.8 million, accounting for roughly 17% of the population. That number is likely larger today, as the U.S. Census Bureau estimates by 2025, the 65+ population will reach 63.3 million.\n\nAlthough other political issues may be overshadowing healthcare in the current election, Americans continue to have serious concerns about their ability to afford the healthcare they need. Data from this study show that more than two in three Americans (67%) are very or somewhat concerned that a major health event could lead to medical debt, including 62% of Republicans, 67% of independents and 71% of Democrats. Issues related to the cost and accessibility of healthcare directly impact the day-to-day life of every voter, regardless of their political party affiliation.\n\nTo stay up to date with the latest Gallup News insights and updates, follow us on X @Gallup.\n\nLearn more about how the Gallup Panel works.\n\n###Embeddable###",

        "text": "Stress less during election season\nWith the 2024 presidential election almost here, many are feeling apprehensive.\n\nThe American Psychological Association reports that in national surveys, nearly half of U.S. adults identify politics as a source of stress, noting problems such as lost sleep, shortened tempers and obsessive thoughts. And research shows that this distress surrounding politics harms both our physical and mental health.\n\n\u201cIt can feel stressful to think of future changes and the uncertainty of an election, but I think it is important to recognize when these feelings overwhelm and affect well-being,\u201d said Alli Beaumont, wellness education program assistant at the Wellness Resource Center. \u201cFocusing on things one can control, like voting and continuing one\u2019s education in school and life, is a way of making an impact and finding that balance.\u201d\n\nThe Wellness Resource Center offers the following tips on how to stay grounded during election season.\n\nPractice mindfulness\n\nMindfulness leads to greater well-being and mental clarity. Intentionally choosing to focus on the present moment can ease anxiety about the future and help us identify what we can control. You can build your practice through\n\nmindful and positive movement (e.g., hiking, biking, yoga, dancing, etc.),\n\ningesting adequate nutrition (i.e., ensuring you are eating a balanced diet and staying hydrated, which will lead to more energy and less fatigue),\n\nbalancing political media intake with uplifting news (e.g., swiping past or temporarily muting certain accounts), and\n\nadvocating for your beliefs in a productive and positive way (e.g., joining peaceful demonstrations, signing petitions, engaging in healthy conversation on political or general topics).\n\nCreate boundaries\n\nReduce feelings of anger, anxiety, fatigue, depression and stress by offering \u201cI\u201d statements that help others understand your expectations (e.g., \u201cI would like five minutes to talk about the election, and then we discuss something else. If we can\u2019t do that, I may need ...\u201d). Set aside specific time(s) or parts of the day to do research on candidates and their policies and then set it down and move forward with other tasks. Limit your time speaking about, absorbing and commenting on political issues. This can include muting the volume of political ads so that you don\u2019t have to hear it. Hold yourself accountable for protecting your peace.\n\nCreate distinctions between people and their viewpoints and opinions\n\nWe can always practice leading with love and empathy. Everyone does not hold the same opinions, and that should be celebrated. We can\u2019t move forward and break barriers if everyone thinks the same. Therefore, we can remind ourselves that we can love someone and not agree with them. While our views are important, they are not the only things that define us.\n\nBe mindful about what types of news you ingest\n\nEnsure you are digesting neutral, unbiased and accurate information. This way you are well-informed and are not distracted by false information.\n\nDisengage from unhelpful conversations\n\nRespect your peace. If there\u2019s a conversation happening that you no longer want to be a part of, you have the option and the right to remove yourself from the conversation. Although people have different opinions, never contribute to disrespecting and/or bullying others.\n\nHealth and well-being resources",

        "text": "What we know so far about JD Vance and Tim Walz\u2019s debate styles\nWhen Tim Walz and JD Vance square off as vice-presidential picks on Tuesday, it will be the biggest debate stage for both of the politicians who are newly becoming household names.\n\nWalz, the Democratic governor of Minnesota, and Vance, a Republican senator from Ohio, have been honing their public speaking skills \u2013 and their pointed barbs at each other \u2013 in TV appearances and at events around the country in the past few months.\n\nTheir experiences in electoral debates haven\u2019t reached the levels or notoriety that come along with a presidential campaign, but both have faced opponents in public debates in past elections.\n\nAnd given the tightness of the presidential race, and how poorly the first presidential debate between Joe Biden and Donald Trump went, there will probably be more people tuned in to the vice presidential debate than in past cycles. While VP debates don\u2019t usually tip the scales much, they could matter in a close race \u2013 and they build profiles for lower-profile politicians who will probably stay on the national scene for years to come.\n\nWalz\u2019s debate experience\n\nTo practice before Tuesday\u2019s VP debate, Walz has used Pete Buttigieg, transportation secretary and frequent TV news interviewee, as a Vance stand-in \u2013 both Buttigieg and Vance are Ivy Leaguers from the midwest and roughly the same age.\n\nWalz, 60, first ran for Congress in a red-leaning district in Minnesota in 2006 and kept the seat until 2019, when he assumed the governor\u2019s office. He ran for governor first in 2018 and then for re-election in 2022.\n\nUSA Today watched 10 hours of Walz\u2019s debate footage from over the years, summarizing: \u201cWalz\u2019s optimism and fire is alive and well in his almost two decades of being in politics.\u201d In his first debate, during the 2006 race where he ousted a Republican incumbent, he was at turns on offense and feisty, the paper noted, including posing a climate question to opponent Gil Gutknecht, then saying: \u201cI\u2019m not sure I would get an answer on that one.\u201d\n\nOver the course of these frequent elections, he has debated his primary and general election opponents. At various points, his detractors have called his answers in debates and press appearances \u201cword salad\u201d, meaning he says a garble of words that don\u2019t quite arrive at a point. Kamala Harris and Donald Trump have also seen their fair share of criticism over word salads.\n\nView image in fullscreen Can\u2019t get enough of the US election? Scan or click here to get our free app and sign up for election alerts.\n\nIn his most recent election, he debated the Republican Scott Jensen in 2022, the only general election debate he did that year.\n\nIn that debate, recapped recently by the Washington Examiner, Jensen attacked Walz on the state\u2019s Covid-19 response, policing, taxes and energy issues. At one point, after Walz defended electric vehicle incentives, Jensen said Walz\u2019s answer was \u201cjust a word salad with no substance\u201d.\n\nWalz sought to hit out at Jensen on abortion, with Jensen attempting to deflect because an abortion question wasn\u2019t on the Minnesota ballot.\n\nThis August, after the VP debate was announced, Jensen posted a photo of himself and an empty podium, an image from a local public television debate that Walz had not agreed to attend. \u201cBe careful, Tim Walz knows a thing or two about not showing up to debates,\u201d Jensen wrote.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Stakes \u2014 Presidential Transition Free newsletter We will guide you through the aftermath of the US election and the transition to a Trump presidency Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His first run for office was in 2022, for Ohio senate. His race was closely watched nationally in part because of his fame as an author and because of the rightwing tech investor Peter Thiel\u2019s huge financial investment in it.\n\nFor Vance\u2019s debate prep, the Minnesota congressman Tom Emmer has stood in as Walz.\n\nIn 2022, Vance ran against the Democrat Tim Ryan. They debated twice, with attack lines being more nationalized and centered around their party\u2019s leaders. Politico called their second matchup \u201cso ugly that it was mildly surprising to see Republican JD Vance and Democratic Rep Tim Ryan shake hands at the end\u201d. Ryan contended that Vance was too close to Trump and said Vance \u201ckissed his ass\u201d, a reference to comments Trump made that year claiming Vance was \u201ckissing my ass he wants my support so bad\u201d. Vance tried to tie Ryan to Nancy Pelosi.\n\nVance defended Trump during the 2022 debate \u2013 something he\u2019s likely to do during Tuesday\u2019s debate as well. In reference to the ass-kissing comments, Vance said Trump \u201ctold a joke\u201d.\n\n\u201cI know the president very well and he was joking about a New York Times story. That\u2019s all he was doing. I didn\u2019t take offense to it \u2013 I talked to the president before it. I talked to the president after it. Everybody there took it as a joke.\u201d\n\nRyan told the Hill that Walz should be himself while also holding Vance accountable for lies and obfuscation. Danny O\u2019Connor, who served as the Vance stand-in for Ryan\u2019s debate prep, told Politico that Vance will probably stay on message and hammer the Trump campaign line on big issues even if it\u2019s untrue, but that he also has a tendency toward awkward laughter, something seen in viral clips from his campaign trail appearances.\n\n\u201cIf someone were to say, \u2018Senator Vance, you\u2019ve supported a national ban on abortion in the past,\u2019 I guarantee he\u2019ll laugh at that and say that\u2019s not true, and then say why he doesn\u2019t support it,\u201d O\u2019Connor told the publication. \u201cGenerally he\u2019ll laugh if something is absolutely true that he needs to defuse.\u201d",

It comes as the Southeast is still grappling with widespread devastation after Helene made landfall last Thursday as the strongest hurricane on record to slam into Florida\u2019s Big Bend region and tore through multiple states. At least 95 people were killed, in addition to knocking out power to millions and trapping families in floodwaters.\n\nHarris was previously scheduled on Monday to make two campaign stops in Nevada before diverting her plans. The adjusted schedule also comes after former President Donald Trump slammed Harris for fundraising on the West Coast this weekend after Helene ripped through the Southeast region.\n\nOn Sunday, Harris was briefed by FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell while traveling on Air Force Two from California to Nevada. She also spoke with North Carolina Gov. Cooper, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Georgia Gov Kemp and reassured them that the Biden Administration will stand with the impacted communities throughout their recovery. She intends to visit impacted communities as soon as it is possible without disrupting emergency response operations. It was not immediately planned when or where she would go.\n\n\u201cWe stand in these communities for as long as it takes to make sure that they are able to recover and rebuild,\u201d Harris said during a rally in Las Vegas.\n\n\u201cWe will provide whatever help they need in the days and weeks ahead,\u201d she later added.\n\nTrump is expected to visit Valdosta, Georgia, on Monday where he will receive a briefing on the devastation caused by Hurricane Helene and \u201cfacilitate the distribution of relief supplies.\u201d",

Levi, who initially supported Robert F. Kennedy Jr. before his withdrawal from the race, made a surprise appearance at a Trump rally in Michigan over the weekend.\n\n\u201cI grew up in a family that was Christian conservative,\u201d Levi shared, reflecting on his political journey. He explained how his parents shifted from being Kennedy Democrats to Reagan Republicans, which shaped his own political views. Levi expressed his initial support for Kennedy, calling him \u201cthe real deal\u201d and lamenting his exit from the race. However, he now believes Trump is the best candidate to address the country\u2019s issues, according to Deadline.\n\n\u201cWe live in a very broken [world]\u2026 hijacked by a lot of people who want to take this place way off the cliff,\u201d Levi stated. He emphasized his belief that Trump, with the backing of RFK Jr. and Tulsi Gabbard, is the leader to \u201cmake [the country] great again.\u201d\n\nFollowing Kennedy\u2019s suspension, Levi\u2019s endorsement adds to the list of high-profile figures supporting Trump. The former president, seeking a second term, recently declared that there would be no third debate, focusing instead on his campaign alongside running mate JD Vance.",

Despite this low visibility, the election will have significant implications for the future of health care reform, according to health policy expert Jonathan Oberlander, PhD.\n\nIn the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), Oberlander tackles these policy issues in a new Perspective piece titled \u201cHealth Care Reform and the 2024 U.S. Elections \u2014 Low Visibility, High Stakes.\u201d Oberlander is a professor and chair in UNC\u2019s Department of Social Medicine and a professor of health policy and management at the UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health.\n\nDue to the prominence of other issues, such as the economy and immigration, as well as the success of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), neither Democrats nor Republicans have offered sweeping reform plans for health care in their presidential campaigns. Oberlander says that health care policy has returned to incrementalism, with a focus on small changes rather than broad transformation. The ACA has been both successful and popular, with 24 million Americans enrolled in Medicaid thanks to the ACA\u2019s provision for Medicaid expansion and 21 million who have obtained insurance through the ACA\u2019s insurance marketplace. More than 60% of Americans now view the law favorably.\n\nOberlander lays out some potential health policy paths that Republicans could take if Donald Trump wins the presidency and the GOP gains Congressional majorities. Pursuing full repeal of the ACA would be politically risky. Instead, Republicans could seek to eliminate specific ACA policies and loosen insurance market regulations. A Trump administration could also choose not to extend premium subsidies for ACA plans that are due to expire in 2026. Republicans could additionally pursue plans to reduce federal funding for Medicaid, revive work requirements for Medicaid enrollees and repeal Medicare\u2019s ability to negotiate some drug prices.\n\nIn contrast, if Kamala Harris is elected president, Oberlander says her administration would seek to build on the ACA. It could pursue policies to control prescription drug costs and provide medical debt relief. Democrats could also seek to close the coverage gap for low-income persons living in states that have not expanded Medicaid and extend the ACA\u2019s enhanced premium subsidies. During the campaign, Harris has not embraced two reforms that Democrats have previously proposed: creating a new government insurance plan (a \u201cpublic option\u201d) and lowering Medicare\u2019s eligibility age from 65 to 60\n\nWhile health care reform has not received much attention in this election, Oberlander says the stakes remain high and a partisan divide persists over whether to continue building on the ACA\u2019s success or adopt policies that would jeopardize its coverage gains.\n\nRead the full Perspective piece in NEJM.",

        "text": "Fact-checking, trust and Election 2024: A Q&A with Professor Lucas Graves\nBy: Ava Menkes\n\nThe work of fact-checkers is complicated but integral to the functioning of the democracy. A study done by Harvard Kennedy School examined Snopes, PolitiFact, Logically and the Australian Associated Press FactCheck from January 2016 to August 2022, finding an increase in fact-checking articles during major events, including the COVID-19 pandemic and the U.S. presidential election.\n\nWith a contentious election on the horizon, fact-checkers have been busy verifying and contextualizing the statements of the two candidates, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, as they campaign in swing states and vie for the Oval Office.\n\nLucas Graves, a professor in the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Journalism and Mass Communication, studies political fact-checking, annotative journalism, net neutrality and the open-source movement, and teaches courses on political behavior, mass communication and society and intermediate reporting. He spoke with us about political fact-checking fundamentals and issues ahead of the 2024 presidential election.\n\nThis article has been edited for clarity and brevity\n\nWhat do you see as the purpose of political fact-checking?\n\nThe central mission is to help the public make sense of political rhetoric and of all the information that they see and to distinguish what\u2019s true from what\u2019s false. Now, you might think, \u2018well, isn\u2019t that what all journalists do?\u2019 And it\u2019s true that journalists \u2014 their core mission is to report true stories as accurately as they can. But what sets fact-checkers apart is that they take some claim that\u2019s already out there in the world, or some rumor, some hoax, you know, some video, some image, they take something that\u2019s already circulating and then they evaluate it for its truth, and then they write that up. So it\u2019s like a little report card on the truth of something a politician says, or some article that\u2019s circulating, and so it\u2019s not just reporting things accurately, it\u2019s actually adjudicating the truth of things that are already out there in the world.\n\nHow should a journalist determine when to fact-check a politician?\n\nOn the one hand, you want to show that you\u2019re checking politicians of all stripes, right? A legitimate fact-checking site should not only be checking claims from Democrats or only checking claims from Republicans. In order to trust a fact-checker, you want to know that they are willing to identify untruths regardless of the source. But at the same time, in a particular political season, in a particular political race, there might be crazier stuff, or more ridiculous claims coming more frequently from one party than another, and that can be for all kinds of reasons. One reason is when one party has an incumbent running and the other party has a primary. Primaries are very competitive, and so you have lots of people saying things to get attention.\n\nYou should try to identify claims that are likely to have an impact, claims that are more important because of what they\u2019re about. In the same way that journalists decide what is the most important news story to cover or to put on the front page in terms of its potential impact on the public or its relevance to the public, if you\u2019re a fact-checker, you\u2019re going to try to fact-check first the most important claims, the claims that tie into major issues of public concern, the claims that might cause harm in the world if they\u2019re believed.\n\nMany people criticized Jake Tapper and Dana Bash from CNN for not fact-checking Trump during the live debate between himself and President Joe Biden in June. Do you think the passive approach of letting candidates reveal themselves works, or do you think they should have intervened and fact-checked both of the candidates during that debate?\n\nI absolutely think that they should intervene, and that\u2019s not just a question of fact-checking, but also a question of trying to push the candidates to respond to the questions that are being asked. Candidates have lots of opportunities to offer their scripted rhetoric to the public. They have plenty of forums where they can do that. The point of a debate should be that they are voluntarily submitting to the questions asked by journalists, or by people from civil society who are at that moment representing things that might be of importance to the public, so that the public can better understand what a given candidate\u2019s policies are.\n\nBut for that to work, number one, they have to be held accountable for, again, responding to the questions instead of just using any question as a chance to repeat whatever talking points they feel like repeating, and number two, responding as accurately as they can. However, ad hoc, off the cuff fact-checking in a political debate doesn\u2019t necessarily work that well. You need to build it into the structure of the debate.\n\nThat said, I think the moderators did an admirable job during the last presidential debate [ABC News\u2019 debate on September 10]. I\u2019ve read complaints that Kamala Harris was given a free pass, and it\u2019s true both candidates made misleading statements that weren\u2019t corrected. But the two times Trump did draw live fact-checks were in a different league. I don\u2019t see how any self-respecting journalist could let that vile claim about Haitian immigrants, or about abortions after birth, go unchallenged.\n\nIs it possible to over fact-check a candidate, and can this affect voter perception and potentially alter electoral outcomes?\n\nIt\u2019s absolutely possible for a candidate to be over fact-checked in the context of a debate or some other public performance, because there is some responsibility to let them present their arguments in a coherent way. So there\u2019s a balance to be struck, right? I mean, if you\u2019re interrupting them in every response or every other minute to correct something, then that\u2019s also interfering with the public\u2019s ability to understand what they\u2019re saying.\n\nThe fact is that anytime we see a fact-check of our preferred candidate, unfortunately, one of our first impulses is to assume that the fact-check is biased. So the best thing that fact-checkers can do is show all of their work, show the evidence that they\u2019ve used to arrive at a particular conclusion, and also their methods. They\u2019re sort of the standard methods journalists use in checking a claim every time they need to publish corrections very promptly and very prominently, when they make mistakes and they need to explain how they choose things to check\u2026so they should be as transparent as possible and allow themselves to be held accountable by the public.\n\nI\u2019m thinking back to 2016 and the Hillary Clinton emails. People complained that the larger news organizations \u2014 the New York Times and Washington Post \u2014 overemphasized that story. I also heard a lot of rhetoric about the Times and the Post publishing too much about Trump, to the point where the press promoted his platform. How should fact-checkers navigate the idea that journalists shouldn\u2019t serve candidate\u2019s ideologies?\n\nI\u2019m glad you brought up the example of the emails. That wasn\u2019t about fact-checking, but that\u2019s a really tricky question, right? I mean, my own opinion is that the Times and other publications in hindsight, did give that story too much play, and we can speculate as to why that was the case. One thing we know is that journalists are at pains to show that they\u2019re objective, that they\u2019re willing to report bad news about either candidate. That was a very juicy story, right? There were little leaks coming out every day from the documents that had been leaked to Wikipedia. So that was kind of a perfect storm. It was really fueling this feeding frenzy among journalists. I think in hindsight, a lot of reasonable reporters think that in the end, that was kind of a non-story. Not that it shouldn\u2019t have been reported on, but should it have led the front page of The New York Times on so many successive days? Should it have been such a prominent theme of the final weeks of the campaign, when it potentially had an impact on the narrative in those final days? Perhaps not. Those aren\u2019t easy judgments to make. It\u2019s easier to say that in hindsight. I suspect that something that helped was that everyone was convinced that Hillary Clinton was going to win.\n\nI have a hard time imagining a fact-checking related story that could have as large of an impact on the election or I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen that yet. Donald Trump and his campaigns, in his public statements since the 2016 race, is less careful with his public statements than other politicians. He demonstrably utters more things that can be shown to be false than other politicians, and that has been covered extensively and aggressively. I think fact-checkers very much saw Donald Trump as a different kind of candidate, because of his unusual way of speaking, compared to career politicians. For instance, the Washington Post throughout Donald Trump\u2019s first term tried to catalog every single false utterance that he made. They\u2019d never done that for any other candidate. They then did it subsequently for Biden for a little while. But fact-checkers did everything they could to draw attention to the truly extraordinary nature of the Trump campaign\u2019s relationship to truth. And it\u2019s not that that didn\u2019t make a difference, but I think it made less of a difference than many observers expected or hoped.\n\nSince 2016, Trump has called mainstream media outlets fake, telling his supporters not to trust coverage on him or his campaign. Do you think political fact-checking can deepen the distrust between Americans and their news outlets? How should publications navigate fact-checking in a way that\u2019s sustainable and helpful while not potentially abusing it or over polarizing the public?\n\nThat\u2019s an excellent question. That\u2019s literally the most important question that fact-checkers are dealing with now, and there\u2019s not really any good answer to it. We don\u2019t have all the evidence that we need, but it is simultaneously true, as your question suggests, that fact-checking can actually widen the trust gap, because it makes journalists and news organizations appear more partisan. It makes them easier for politicians to attack. It increases antagonism between journalists and political figures simply because of the nature of the work.\n\nIf you\u2019re doing high quality fact-checking, if you publish your methods, and you\u2019re transparent about all your sources, and you publish corrections when you make mistakes\u2026at least some people who read fact-checking appreciate that this demonstrates the journalist\u2019s responsibility to report the truth to their audience.\n\nFact-checkers really struggle with this question, and they have engaged in all kinds of different sort of experiments in trust building to try to help people to understand that even though they identify some claims as false, or identify some candidate as producing a lot of falsehoods, it doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re against that person or that they\u2019re taking a side in wider political debates.\n\nThere\u2019s not an easy answer and you know, regardless of your ideology, it\u2019s true that you, your first instinct will be to reject some fact-check that goes against the candidate who lines up with your beliefs, with your ideology.\n\nAva Menkes is a 2024-25 student fellow at the Center for Journalism Ethics and a junior at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison where she\u2019s studying journalism and political science.\n\nThe Center for Journalism Ethics encourages the highest standards in journalism ethics worldwide.

        "text": "US Resettles Most Refugees in 3 Decades, Keeps FY25 Refugee Cap at 125,000\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\n\nSeptember 30, 2024\n\nContact: Timothy Young | timothy.young@globalrefuge.org\n\nWashington, D.C. \u2013 The White House announced today that President Biden has officially signed the Fiscal Year (FY) 2025 Presidential Determination on refugee admissions, maintaining the annual cap at 125,000 refugees.\n\nWhile the target remains the same for the fourth consecutive fiscal year, arrivals through the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) have significantly increased from an all-time low of 11,411 in FY 2021, which followed dramatic cuts by the Trump administration and operational complications from the COVID-19 pandemic. In FY 2024, refugee admissions reached 100,034, of which more than 14,000 were welcomed by Global Refuge, marking the highest level of refugee resettlement since FY 1995.\n\nTop countries of origin include refugees from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Afghanistan, Syria, Venezuela and Burma (Myanmar). FY 2024 also saw the highest ever level of resettlement of refugees from Latin America and the Caribbean, with more than 20,000 admissions from the region, thanks in large part to the Biden administration\u2019s launch of its Safe Mobility Offices \u2013 overseas processing centers where refugees can access eligibility screenings for legal pathways to enter the United States.\n\nIn response to the growth of the refugee program, Krish O\u2019Mara Vignarajah, President and CEO of Global Refuge, said:\n\n\u201cWe commend the Biden administration for its steadfast efforts to rebuild the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program. Resettling 100,000 refugees, a figure surpassing the three previous fiscal years combined, represents a milestone achievement signaling renewed U.S. humanitarian leadership. Thanks to this administration\u2019s commitment, these families have found safety, hope, and a sense of belonging in communities that are eager to embrace them as neighbors, friends, congregants, and co-workers.\u201d\n\n\u201cDespite continued misinformation about refugees, these newcomers revitalize the fabric of our communities, address critical labor shortages, and contribute billions more in tax revenue than they ever receive in government assistance. They may arrive with little, but like every previous generation of those yearning to breathe free, refugees make our nation stronger than they found it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs we inch closer to the 2024 election, there is much uncertainty about the future of persecuted refugees\u2019 ability to seek safety and freedom in the United States. Our sincere hope is to continue this country\u2019s long bipartisan legacy of welcoming the most vulnerable and leading by the power of our example. In these divisive times, we ask Americans to look for the best of themselves reflected in refugees: an enduring search for freedom, a drive to provide for their loved ones, to turn struggle into possibility, and to shine as a beacon for those who need hope the most.\u201d\n\nGlobal Refuge urges continued progress in FY 2025 on resettling groups facing continued risks to their safety, such as Afghan refugees and Rohingya refugees in eastern Bangladesh. Global Refuge also encourages the U.S. government to expand access to protection for displaced populations vulnerable to climate-related risks.\n\n##\n\nAbout us:\n\nGlobal Refuge, formerly Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, is a nonprofit serving newcomers seeking safety, support, and a share in the American dream. For 85 years, we have welcomed those seeking refuge, upholding a legacy of compassion and grace for people in crisis. We walk alongside individuals, families, and children as they begin their new lives in the United States through our work in refugee resettlement, welcome and respite services for asylum seekers, economic empowerment and employment, and family unification for unaccompanied children. To date, we have served over 750,000 people from around the globe. At Global Refuge, welcoming newcomers isn\u2019t just our duty\u2014it\u2019s an inherent part of our identity, rooted in our Lutheran heritage and inspired values, and serving as a testament to our unwavering commitment to those in search of refuge.",

Many states require voted ballots to reach local election officials by the time polls close on election day (Tuesday, November 5).

The FWAB is available at www.FVAP.gov. If your regular ballot arrives later, complete and return it as well. Your FWAB will only be counted if your regular ballot does not reach local election officials by your state\u2019s deadline. Your vote will not be counted twice.\n\nRETURNING YOUR BALLOT:\n\nIf you plan to drop your ballot off at the U.S. Embassy to be returned to your local election office, we recommend you do so no later than October 4. Please ensure your ballot is addressed to your local election officials and is either placed a postage-paid envelope or bears sufficient domestic U.S. postage. If you plan to use the U.S. Embassy\u2019s diplomatic pouch, please drop off your completed ballots to the attention of American Citizen Services at U.S. Embassy in Santiago, Ave. Andres Bello 2800, Las Condes, Monday through Friday, from 8:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m., except on holidays.\n\nMissed the U.S. Embassy Santiago shipment deadline?\n\nIf your state allows, you may be able to return your voted ballot to your local election office electronically. You can also consider returning your ballot via an express courier service at your own expense. Ballots sent via express courier do not receive standard postmarks, so voters using this method should confirm delivery on or before November 5 prior to payment and shipment. Check your state\u2019s voting procedures at www.FVAP.gov for guidance.\n\nIf you have previously registered to vote and requested an absentee ballot but it has not yet arrived, some states allow voters to email or fax their voted, signed Federal Write-in Absentee Ballots to local election officials. Review your state\u2019s voting procedures at www.FVAP.gov carefully for guidance.\n\nReturning your ballot by international mail.\n\nIf using Chile\u2019s postal system, be sure to include sufficient international postage, and allow enough time for delivery. Ballots sent via regular international mail at this point are unlikely to reach local election officials by state ballot receipt deadlines.\n\nHELP SPREAD THE WORD ABOUT OVERSEAS VOTING.\n\nPlease help spread the word to your friends, family, and colleagues that now is the time return your ballot if you are voting from overseas.\n\nNeed help?\n\nYou can get in-person assistance from our U.S. Embassy Voting Assistance Officer and additional voting information can be found on the U.S. Embassy website.\n\nHave Questions?\n\nPlease contact U.S. Embassy Santiago\u2019s Voting Assistance Officer at +562-2330-3716, or at votesantiago@state.gov.

        "text": "State poll: Katie Porter early frontrunner for California governor\nNew poll of California likely voters also shows Kamala Harris outperforming Joe Biden against Donald Trump in the U.S. presidential race.\n\nContact: Ileana Wachtel at iwachtel@usc.edu; Lance Ignon at ignon@usc.edu; Paul McQuiston at paulmcq@usc.edu.\n\nU.S. Rep. Katie Porter is the early frontrunner in a wide-open race to become California\u2019s next governor \u2014 if she decides to run \u2014 according to a new poll from USC, Cal Poly Pomona and California State University, Long Beach. But with two years to go until the gubernatorial election, polling experts say it\u2019s still anyone\u2019s race to win.\n\nPorter, a Democrat who came up short in her primary bid for U.S. Senate, received 14% support when matched against a dozen people who have either announced they are running or are rumored to be running for governor in 2026. The closest hypothetical competitor was Republican State Sen. Brian Dahle, with 5.3% of the vote. Attorney General Rob Bonta (3.5%) was the second best-performing Democrat.\n\n\u201cThe 2026 governor\u2019s race is wide open and anyone could win,\u201d said Christian Grose, professor of political science and international relations and public policy at the USC Price School of Public Policy and the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences. \u201cDriven by high statewide name recognition after her unsuccessful Senate primary run, Katie Porter leads the pack.\u201d\n\nThose are just some of the results of the latest California Elections and Policy Poll sponsored by the Long Beach Center for Urban Politics and Policy at Cal State Long Beach in collaboration with USC. The statewide survey asked 1,685 likely voters in California, including 311 from Los Angeles County, about the 2024 U.S. presidential and Senate elections, as well as ballot propositions, public policies and local races that voters will decide this November.\n\nResults from a separate California Elections and Policy Poll on U.S. House races in California can be found here.\n\nHarris outperforms Biden in California\n\nThe poll suggests Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 entry into the presidential race could help Democrats across California. Harris (56.5%) is easily beating former President Donald Trump (33.7%), and support increases to 57.7% for Harris and 35.5% for Trump when undecided voters are pushed to choose. President Joe Biden, who dropped out in July after his presidential debate performance amplified concerns about his age, received just 53% in a statewide poll conducted in January.\n\n\u201cKamala Harris is polling better than Joe Biden was even before his disastrous debate performance,\u201d Grose said. \u201cHarris\u2019 strength relative to Biden in the state could boost down-ballot Democrats in House and state legislative elections.\u201d\n\nOther election findings from the poll include:\n\nDemocrat Adam Schiff (52.7%) maintains a large lead over Republican Steve Garvey (33.8%) in the race for the U.S. Senate.\n\nThe proposal to create a new L.A. County executive \u2014 it would be an elected position \u2014 and increase the number of Board of Supervisor districts to nine from five is favored by 35.6% of likely voters in the county and opposed by 17.4%.\n\nIn the election for L.A. District Attorney, Nathan Hochman (44.4%) has a significant lead over incumbent George Gasc\u00f3n (20.3%). About one-third of voters remain undecided in this race.\n\n\u201cNathan Hochman has taken a decisive lead over George Gasc\u00f3n outside the margin of error of the poll,\u201d Grose said. \u201cGasc\u00f3n is stuck in the 20s in the poll, which is pretty similar to the primary vote he received in March. The poll also shows that voters are concerned about crime, and those with crime concerns are more likely to support Hochman. Gasc\u00f3n\u2019s remaining hope is the large percentage of undecided voters.\u201d\n\nVoters support proposals on AI, crime\n\nThe poll also surveyed Californians about ballot propositions and public policies before the state Legislature.\n\nAmong those is a recently passed California bill (SB1047) that would require developers of advanced artificial intelligence models to adopt safety measures. Although the bill is controversial among state lawmakers, the proposal is supported by a majority (56.9%) of California voters, compared to just 14.7% who oppose the measure.\n\n\u201cThe AI safety bill is quite popular among California voters, with a majority supporting the legislation,\u201d Grose said. \u201cAmong the state\u2019s elected officials, the bill has divided Democrats due to fears over unintended consequences that could drive off innovation and jobs being balanced by the need for AI safety regulations.\u201d\n\nCalifornia voters also strongly favor Proposition 36, which would allow felony charges for possessing certain drugs and for thefts under $950. The poll found that 57.9% of likely voters favor Proposition 36 to increase criminal penalties for petty theft and drug use, while only 19.0% oppose Proposition 36.\n\n###\n\nMore about the California Elections and Policy Polls: The statewide California Elections and Policy Poll of 1,685 likely voters was conducted from Sept. 12-25 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.4 percentage points. The poll of 311 likely voters within L.A. County has a margin of error of plus or minus 5.6 percentage points for the questions specific to L.A. County.\n\nIn addition to Grose, the poll was conducted by Cal State Long Beach Associate Professor Matthew Mendez Garcia; Cal State Long Beach Assistant Professor Matt Lesenyie; Cal Poly Pomona Assistant Professor Jarred Cuellar; Jose Alcocer, a doctoral student at USC Dornsife and 2017 Master of Public Policy graduate of USC Price; and Raquel Centeno, a doctoral student at USC Dornsife. The methodology for identifying likely voters, sampling and weighting to ensure the poll is representative of the statewide electorate is available in the full poll report.\n\nImage credits:\n\nTop image: Composite: Letty Avila, USC Dornsife; Image Source: iStock.\n\nInfographics: Letty Avila, USC Dornsife.",

Here\u2019s what you need to know\n\ntoggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images; Jae Hong/AP\n\nVice presidential candidates Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, will face off in a debate Tuesday night for the 2024 election cycle.\n\nThis will be the only time the candidates meet onstage and simultaneously present their policy positions to the broader American public, which may be less familiar with them than with their partners on the presidential ticket.\n\nThe two hold similar roles in their respective campaigns: to appeal to working-class voters in the \"Blue Wall\" states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin this fall.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about what is historically the only debate between the candidates for vice president.\n\nWhen and how to watch?\n\nThis debate will be hosted by CBS News in New York City at 9 p.m. ET.\n\nCBS Evening News anchor and managing editor Norah O\u2019Donnell and Face the Nation moderator and chief foreign affairs correspondent Margaret Brennan will moderate the debate at the CBS Broadcast Center. The debate will air live on CBS, CBS News Streaming Network and Paramount+ and stream live without a cable login on CBSNews.com.\n\nFollow NPR's live blog on Tuesday for the latest updates, analysis, fact-checking and color \u2014 and also watch the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate Simulcast. And you can listen to NPR\u2019s special debate coverage on many public radio stations and in the NPR app.\n\n\n\nWho are the running mates?\n\nFormer President Donald Trump announced Vance as his running mate on the first day of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee this summer.\n\nThe first-term senator, who was once a critic of Trump, came to political relevance when he wrote the book Hillbilly Elegy, blaming President Biden and Democrats for the struggles of the rural economy he grew up in. In the Senate, Vance has positioned himself against Republican leadership at times but on issues like abortion, immigration and election integrity, he's closely aligned with Trump.\n\nVice President Harris chose Walz just weeks after she was tapped to replace President Biden at the top of the ticket.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nWalz got the nickname \u201cCoach Walz\u201d for being a former football coach and teacher. As governor, Walz secured several progressive wins in his state, including clean energy mandates, universal free school meals, family and medical leave benefits and abortion protections.\n\nWhat to watch for\n\nSince his nomination, Vance has had to address controversies that are likely to come up again during the debate, including couch-related jokes and criticisms of him calling prominent Democrats \u201cchildless cat ladies.\u201d Vance has also come under fire for spreading the false claim that Haitian immigrants are eating pets in Ohio.\n\nWalz, a two-term governor, has also faced questions about his response to riots in Minneapolis following the 2020 murder of George Floyd and widespread fraud during COVID-19 under a federal program intended to provide food assistance to students after schools closed. Audits have suggested lapses in oversight by the state Department of Education.\n\nWalz has been getting help for the debate from Pete Buttigieg, the U.S. transportation secretary. Buttigieg helped Harris with her VP debate prep in 2020. It wasn't immediately clear whom Vance is preparing with.\n\nThe military records of both candidates are also likely to come up.\n\nVance criticized Walz for his military record, including for saying he carried weapons \u201cin war\u201d when he had not been in combat.\n\nWalz, who served in the National Guard for 20 years and reenlisted after Sept. 11, only saw wartime deployment to Italy in 2003. Vance, who served in the Marines and did a six-month deployment to Iraq, also has not seen combat.\n\n\n\nWhat are the rules for the debate?\n\nThe debate will last 90 minutes and both campaigns have agreed to a set of rules.\n\nThere will be no audience in attendance, and the candidates will each take a stand behind podiums. Candidates will have two minutes for closing statements. Vance won a virtual coin toss on Sept. 26 and elected to go second with his closing statement.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nVance and Walz will not be allowed to have prewritten notes or props, and topics and questions will not be shared in advance with campaigns. Unlike the presidential debates, microphones will remain on but CBS News reserves the right to turn them off.\n\nAccording to CBS News, each candidate will get two minutes to answer each question, and the other candidate will get two minutes to respond. Then, each candidate gets one minute for further rebuttals. At the discretion of the moderators, candidates may get an additional minute each to continue a discussion.\n\n\n\nWhat comes next?\n\nThis is likely to be the last debate before Election Day. Across several states, mail ballots have already started going out.\n\nHarris challenged Trump to one more debate on Oct. 23 but Trump declined, saying it was \u201ctoo late.\u201d\n\nElection Day is Nov. 5.",

He claimed in front of a cheering crowd on Sunday that Harris was responsible for an \u201cinvasion\u201d at the United States-Mexico border and told them \u201cshe should be impeached and prosecuted for her actions\u201d.\n\n\u201cCrooked Joe Biden became mentally impaired,\u201d he added. \u201cSad. But lying Kamala Harris, honestly, I believe she was born that way. There\u2019s something wrong with Kamala. And I just don\u2019t know what it is, but there is definitely something missing. And you know what, everybody knows it.\u201d\n\nWith about a month until the election, Trump is intensifying his use of personal and offensive attacks, even as some Republicans say he would be better off sticking to the issues that concern voters.\n\nTrump has long threatened legal action against his rivals, including President Joe Biden and his 2016 rival, Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrump has many legal problems of his own. He was convicted in May of falsifying business records in a hush money case in New York, with sentencing scheduled for November 26. Two other cases are pending \u2013 a federal case for his alleged role in the January 6, 2021, insurrection, and a state case in Georgia for his efforts to overturn his 2020 loss there to Biden. Prosecutors are appealing against a federal judge\u2019s dismissal of a case involving his handling of classified documents.\n\nTrump argues federal and state prosecutors are targeting him for political reasons. There is no evidence to suggest that is true.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump acknowledged he might lose in November: \u201cIf she wins, it\u2019s not going to be so pleasant for me, but I don\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nTrump criticised for remarks on Harris\n\nTrump has derided Harris, the first Black woman and person of South Asian descent to lead a major party ticket, as \u201cstupid\u201d, \u201cweak\u201d, \u201cdumb as a rock\u201d and \u201clazy\u201d. His allies have pushed him publicly and privately to talk instead about the economy, immigration and other issues.\n\n\u201cI just think the better course to take is to prosecute the case that her policies are destroying the country,\u201d Senator Lindsey Graham told CNN\u2019s State of the Union programme on Sunday when asked about Trump\u2019s comments, describing Harris\u2019s policies as \u201ccrazy liberal\u201d.\n\nWhen asked whether he approved of Trump\u2019s personal attacks on Harris, Republican Tom Emmer sidestepped the question during an interview on ABC\u2019s This Week.\n\n\u201cI think Kamala Harris is the wrong choice for America,\u201d said Emmer, who is helping Trump\u2019s running mate JD Vance prepare for Tuesday\u2019s vice presidential debate. \u201cI think Kamala Harris is actually as bad or worse as the administration that we\u2019ve witnessed for the last four years.\u201d\n\nWhen pressed, Emmer said: \u201cI think we should stick to the issues. The issues are \u2013 Donald Trump fixed it once \u2013 they broke it. He\u2019s going to fix it again. Those are the issues.\u201d\n\nHarris has not commented on Trump\u2019s recent attacks but has said when asked about other comments that it was the \u201csame old show. The same tired playbook we\u2019ve heard for years with no plan on how he would address the needs of the American people.\u201d",

        "text": "Election Officials Plan for Voting Post-Helene\nRaleigh, N.C.\n\nAs rescue and recovery efforts continue after Hurricane Helene, North Carolina election officials are working to ensure voters affected by the storm can still cast their ballot in the 2024 general election.\n\nState Board staff have contacted election officials in the affected counties in Western North Carolina to make sure they are safe, to gather information on damage to election and voting facilities, and to assess potential effects on absentee and in-person voting.\n\nAbsentee voting is underway in North Carolina. In-person early voting begins Oct. 17 and ends Nov. 2. Election Day is Nov. 5.\n\n\u201cOur hearts go out to all North Carolinians affected by Hurricane Helene, including our neighbors, friends and colleagues in Western North Carolina,\u201d said Karen Brinson Bell, executive director of the State Board of Elections. \u201cWhen disasters strike elections, we use this mantra: \u2018We do not stop an election; we figure out how to proceed.\u2019\n\nWhile we do not know exactly what is ahead, our guiding force between now and Election Day will be to do everything possible to ensure every eligible North Carolina voter can cast their ballot. Natural disasters have affected elections here in the recent past. As we did at those times, we will conduct a safe, secure, and successful election in 2024.\u201d\n\nInformation for Voters\n\nThe State Board has launched a special webpage, ncsbe.gov/Helene, as a source of information for voters affected by the hurricane. The webpage will include information on county board office closures, tips for voters affected by the storm, and basic information about voting in this election. It will be updated routinely.\n\nElection officials also will work to provide printed materials to voters in the affected areas who may not have cell phone service or internet access.\n\nStorm victims with questions or concerns about how they will be able to vote are encouraged to contact their county board of elections or the State Board of Elections via email at elections.sboe@ncsbe.gov or by calling (919) 814-0700. Please recognize that many county board offices in the affected counties are unable to reopen until utilities are restored, and therefore may be delayed in responding to calls, emails, and other requests.\n\nThe State Board will provide regular updates through media interviews, press releases, social media posts, and on our website at ncsbe.gov/Helene.\n\nCounty Board Office Closures\n\nMany county boards of elections offices in Western North Carolina are either closed or have limited accessibility due to power, phone, and/or internet outages. See ncsbe.gov/Helene for county office information. The State Board will provide special emergency kits to counties without internet service. These kits, basically \u201celection offices in a box,\u201d will allow county elections workers to continue election preparations, including registering voters and processing absentee ballot requests, as crews work to get power, phone, and internet services restored.\n\nState Board Emergency Powers\n\nUnder Emergency powers (N.C.G.S. \u00a7 163-27.1), the five-member, bipartisan State Board \u201cin an open meeting, may exercise emergency powers to conduct an election in a district where the normal schedule for the elections is disrupted\u201d by a natural disaster. At a meeting on Monday, the State Board passed a resolution allowing the 25 counties in the Helene federal disaster area flexibility to reschedule meetings required by law to consider returned absentee ballots. These meetings were expected to start Tuesday in all 100 counties, but it may be impossible for some county boards to meet on Tuesday. Additional State Board meetings may be called as necessary to consider other emergency measures.\n\nAbsentee Voting\n\nThe U.S. Postal Service has informed election officials that mail delivery and operations are suspended at dozens of post offices in Western North Carolina. Also, many residential mailboxes likely have been washed away by the storm. This, obviously, will have a significant impact on absentee voting in these parts of the state. Election officials will continue to monitor mail delivery and consider ways to make voting available in areas affected by Helene.\n\nHere are tips and reminders for voters who planned to vote by mail in those locations:\n\nA voter who has requested an absentee ballot does not have to vote that ballot. They may simply discard it and vote in-person during the in-person early voting period or on Election Day.\n\nVoters displaced by the storm who plan to live elsewhere temporarily may request an absentee ballot and have it sent to their temporary address. The easiest way to request an absentee ballot is online through the North Carolina Absentee Ballot Portal. A voter who has already requested a ballot but will not be able to receive it at the address where it was set to be delivered should contact their county board of elections to spoil the original ballot and have a new one sent to their temporary location.\n\nDamage to Election Offices, Equipment, Voting Sites\n\nAt this time, election officials are not aware of any situations where voting equipment or printed ballots were lost or damaged. Assessments are ongoing. Details on changes to early voting sites or Election Day polling places will be released as soon as information is available. When voting sites are not available, options include moving or combining polling locations. All options will be considered by the State Board to ensure access to voting\n\nVoter Photo ID\n\nState law requires voters to show an acceptable form of photo ID when voting in person and to include a photocopy of their photo ID with their ballot when voting by mail. Most people will show their driver\u2019s license, but many other IDs are acceptable.\n\nUnder state law, a voter who cannot provide an acceptable form of ID when they vote may fill out a Photo ID Exception Form to explain why they cannot show ID. One of the permitted exceptions is for voters who are unable to provide ID because of a natural disaster that occurred within 100 days of an election and that resulted in a disaster declaration by the President of the United States or the Governor of North Carolina. This means that voters in or from the 25 counties under a disaster declaration may use this exception to the photo ID requirement, if they are unable to show ID when voting because of the natural disaster.",

        "text": "Breaking down the US presidential election: how does it work in modern America?\n4 min read\n\nThis November, America decides her next president. Whoever stands victorious from the US presidential election will hold sway over the White House for the next four years. Now all eyes are on the United States come November 5th, but many look uncertainly. Few would admit it, but there\u2019s plenty of confusion surrounding the US presidential election. How does it work, the timid onlookers ask? Meanwhile the rest of us should ask\u2014does it work?\n\nUS election results have far-reaching impacts beyond the \u201cland of the free\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ve likely heard that old adage of the American president being the world\u2019s most powerful person. Whether or not it\u2019s true, the mystique allows the US election results to capture attention planet-wide. The elected Democrat or Republican\u2019s policies will impact life at home and abroad. And after an eventful debate back in early September, this year\u2019s sort-of-rematch between Trump and Harris is already lighting up switchboards.\n\n\u201cI probably took a bullet to the head because of the things they say about me. They talk about democracy, I\u2019m a threat to democracy. They\u2019re the threat to democracy,\u201d Donald Trump on the 60th US presidential election\n\nDespite the \u201call powerful\u201d aura of the president, their individual whims don\u2019t hold much weight. A president may pass some laws on their own, but the bulk of their job involves working with Congress to pass legislation. A president alone can\u2019t declare war, for example. Nor can they spend federal money, or choose Supreme Court Justices. The constitution is top dog. And the Supreme Court is the constitution institution-ified.\n\nStill, the importance of America\u2019s elective decision can\u2019t be underestimated. Whoever wins will have plenty of freedom to dictate foreign policy. This is salient when considering the US claims 40% of total military spending in the world and has armed forces in some 170 nations. Then consider that the US contributes to 15.9% of all manufacturing output and leads globally in Research & Development\u2014a tasty 10% more than China. US soft power is unparallelled. And those casting a ballot in the US presidential election will know that fact all too well.\n\nHow the US presidential election works: the system deciding who will live at the White House\n\nSo, how will the election work on November 5th? There\u2019s good and bad news; it\u2019ll work just like it has for the last 250 years. Voters will ballot for state electors. These electors then vote for a presidential candidate. Since electors campaign exclusively for one candidate, voters know where their ballot\u2019s going. 270 of 538 electors tips the majority. That\u2019s what a presidential candidate needs to win.\n\nWhether this is good or bad news depends on your perspective. It\u2019s not the individual voters who decide the next president. It\u2019s the Electoral College. And the winner-take-all system flattens out the nuances of the popular vote; for instance, a presidential candidate (Hillary Clinton) could win more ballots from the general public but still lose. Voters from densely populated states technically have less individual sway than voters from sparsely populated states. The pie of power, so to speak, is dished out in varied portions.\n\n\u201cUnder the winner-take-all system, U.S. citizens have been denied their constitutional right to an equal vote in presidential elections. This is a clear violation of the principle of one person, one vote,\u201d explains David Boies\n\nIt\u2019s easy to criticize. Meanwhile, mobilizing 333 million people to vote is not. Changing the system would mean rewriting the Constitution, which is a complex matter. It\u2019s better, then, to focus on simpler improvements. Automatic voter registration, for example, or the possibility of registering to vote on Election Day. November 5th could be made a public holiday to free up work schedules. School curriculums could be honed to clarify who can vote in US elections and demystify the process. For now, though, the sure-fire way to make a difference is the same as ever: to stand up and be counted.\n\nCounting the US election polls for the nation\u2019s 250-year anniversary: a high-stakes undertaking for modern history\n\nEither Harris or Trump will be in office for the nation\u2019s 250-year birthday. It\u2019s a mouthwatering proposition for anyone wanting to make history. Adding to the emotion will be Trump\u2019s quest for vindication after his previous tenure. Harris, on the other hand, wants to be the first female president to live at the White House.\n\nThe excitement will be as high as ever for this term\u2019s US election. Polls will be counted, nails will be chewed. And then we\u2019ll do it all over again in four years\u2019 time. Names are written in history, but that\u2019s the only permanence to the gig. What does last is the will of the American people.\n\n\u201cWith this election, our nation has a precious, fleeting opportunity to move past the bitterness, cynicism and divisive battles of the past. A chance to chart a New Way Forward. Not as members of any one party or faction. But as Americans,\u201d says Kamala Harris\n\nAmerica will make its choice. After 250 years of independence and a steadfast title as a global superpower, the likelihood is the choice will be the right one. Each candidate will simply have to prove that\u2019s them.\n\nOffering you the choice to study abroad in Europe: IE University welcomes American students\n\nIE University prides itself on a network of students from over 170 different countries.

Did you know that many U.S. federal elections for the House of Representatives and Senate have been decided by a margin smaller than the number of ballots cast by absentee voters? All states are required to count every absentee ballot that is valid and reaches local election officials by the absentee ballot receipt deadline.\n\nThe United States DOES NOT have in person voting at U.S. embassies or consulates abroad. If you cannot take advantage of your state\u2019s specific in-person voting requirements, you should plan to vote by absentee ballot.\n\nVerify your voter registration now! Most states and jurisdictions have registration deadlines. If you want to vote this fall, you should verify your status and registration NOW.\n\nFollow a few simple steps to make sure that you can vote absentee in the 2024 federal U.S. elections:\n\nRequest your ballot. We encourage you to request your blank ballots be delivered electronically (by email, internet download, or fax, depending on your state). Many states can send you a full absentee ballot. FVAP.gov will have instructions for your state or local jurisdiction.\n\nYou can complete the Federal Post Card Application (FPCA) online at FVAP.gov. The online voting assistant will ask you questions specific to your state. Each request for the FPCA is limited to the year in which it is requested. You must complete a new FPCA to ensure you receive your ballot for the 2024 elections. Submitting the FPCA allows you to request absentee ballots for all elections for federal offices (President, U.S. Senate, and U.S. House of Representatives) including primaries and special elections during the calendar year in which it is submitted. All local election officials in all U.S. states and territories accept the FPCA. Include your email address on your FPCA to take advantage of the electronic ballot delivery option. Return the FPCA per the instructions on the website. Receive and complete your ballot. States are required to send out ballots 45 days before a regular election for federal office and generally send ballots at least 30 days before primary elections. For most states, you can confirm your registration and ballot delivery online. Return your completed ballot. Remember U.S. embassies and consulates are not polling places. Same-day, in-person voting is not available outside the United States. Many states require voted ballots to reach local election officials by the time polls close on election day (Tuesday, November 5). U.S. citizens who want to participate in the 2024 U.S. elections from overseas should have already returned their absentee ballots to their local election officials. If you plan to drop your ballot off at the embassy to be returned to your local election office, we recommend you do so no later than October 4. Please ensure your ballot is addressed to your local election officials and is either placed a postage-paid envelope or bears sufficient domestic U.S. postage. While some states allow you to return your completed ballot electronically, others do not. If your state requires you to return paper voting forms or ballots to local election officials, you can do so through the drop boxes located at U.S. Embassy Jerusalem, U.S. Embassy Branch Office Tel Aviv, and America House Ramallah. We will send your ballot by U.S. Embassy diplomatic pouch. Place your ballot in a postage-paid return envelope or in an envelope bearing sufficient domestic U.S. postage and address it to the relevant local election office.\n\nBe aware that it can take four weeks or more for mail to reach its destination via diplomatic pouch, and we do not have the ability to track those documents. If you want or need the ability to track your forms or ballot, you should return your FPCA or ballot to your local election officials via international mail or professional courier service at your own expense.\n\nIf you want to return your voting forms and ballots by the U.S. Embassy diplomatic pouch, you may drop them off at the following locations:\n\nU.S. Embassy Jerusalem (14 David Flusser), Monday through Friday, excluding U.S and local holidays, between 8:00 am and 1:00 pm. The drop box is located at the entrance to the Consular Section.\n\nU.S. Embassy Branch Office Tel Aviv (71 HaYarkon), Monday through Friday, excluding U.S. and local holidays, between 8:00 am and 1:00 pm. The drop box is located at the entrance to the Consular Section.\n\nAmerica House Ramallah , Sunday through Thursday, excluding U.S. and local holidays, between 10:00 am and 3:00 pm.\n\nFVAP recommends voters to submit an FPCA at least 90 days before the election (by August 7, 2024). Election officials start to send out ballots 45 days before each election (by September 21, 2024). FVAP recommends overseas voters to submit their ballots to the Embassy at least 4 weeks before the election (by October 4, 2024) to ensure that your vote is counted by your state\u2019s election officials. If you have not received an absentee ballot within 30 days of requesting it, you can use the Federal Write-In Absentee Ballot (FWAB) as a backup ballot to vote for federal offices.\n\nNever received your ballot?\n\nIf you registered to vote and requested an absentee ballot prior to your state\u2019s registration deadline, but have not yet received your ballot, you can complete and return a Federal Write-in Absentee Ballot (FWAB) and return it to your local election office. The FWAB is available at www.FVAP.gov. If your regular ballot arrives later, complete and return it as well. Your FWAB will only be counted if your regular ballot does not reach local election officials by your state\u2019s deadline. Your vote will not be counted twice.\n\nMissed the U.S. embassy shipment deadline?\n\nIf your state allows, you may be able to return your voted ballot to your local election office electronically. You can also consider returning your ballot via an express courier service at your own expense. Ballots sent via express courier do not receive standard postmarks, so voters using this method should confirm delivery on or before November 5 prior to payment and shipment. Check your state\u2019s voting procedures at www.FVAP.gov for guidance.\n\nIf you have previously registered to vote and requested an absentee ballot but it has not yet arrived, some states allow voters to email or fax their voted, signed Federal Write-in Absentee Ballots to local election officials. Review your state\u2019s voting procedures at www.FVAP.gov carefully for guidance.\n\nHelp spread the word about overseas voting!\n\nPlease help spread the word to your friends, family, and colleagues that now is the time return your ballot if you are voting from overseas.\n\nResearch candidates and issues. Please see the FVAP links page for resources you can use to research candidates and issues.\n\nLearn more at FVAP.gov. If you have any questions about registering to vote overseas, contact U.S. Embassy Jerusalem\u2019s Voting Assistance Officers at votejerusalem@state.gov or votetelaviv@state.gov.\n\nRemember, your vote counts!\n\nAssistance:\n\nU.S. Embassy Jerusalem\n\n14 David Flusser St.\n\nJerusalem\n\nOnline ACS Inquiry System: click here\n\nPhone: +972-2-630-4000\n\nWebsite: https://il.usembassy.gov/\n\nU.S. Embassy Branch Office Tel Aviv\n\n71 HaYarkon St.\n\nTel Aviv\n\nRoutine: click here\n\nOnline ACS Inquiry System: click here\n\nPhone: +972-3-519-7575\n\nWebsite: https://il.usembassy.gov/\n\nState Department \u2013 Consular Affairs\n\n888-407-4747or 202-501-4444\n\nIsrael, West Bank, and Gaza Country Information\n\nIsrael, West Bank, and Gaza Travel Advisory\n\nFollow us on Facebook and Twitter",

        "summary": " Maryland has voted consistently blue for eight presidential elections . The 2024 election will be the first general election after the COVID-19 pandemic . Maryland voters have chosen only three Republican candidates since the 1960s: Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and George H. W. Bush .",
        "text": "How \u201cblue\u201d is Maryland? A closer look at the state\u2019s voting history\nThe 2024 election is Donald Trump\u2019s third bid for the U.S. presidency, having won in 2016 and lost in 2020. Maryland voted for the Democratic candidate in both cases and its 10 electoral votes have been considered a given for the Democratic candidate in past general elections.\n\nAs we near the 2024 general election, Capital News Service examined how Maryland has voted in presidential elections over the past 50 years.\n\n\u201cMaryland as a whole has high levels of education, which is one of the things\u2014but only one of the things\u2014that helps to account for its commitment to the Democrats,\u201d said Matthew Crenson, professor emeritus at Johns Hopkins University\u2019s political science department.\n\nOther factors Crenson mentioned were that Black voters make up around 30% of Maryland\u2019s electorate, as well as large numbers of the Latino community, although the political leanings of the latter demographic are currently in flux.\n\nCurrent Maryland opinion polls for the 2024 election have Harris ahead of Trump by a significant margin, par for the course in a state that has voted consistently blue for eight presidential elections. According to data from the Maryland State Board of Elections, Maryland voters have chosen only three Republican candidates since the 1960s: Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and George H. W. Bush.\n\nIn 1972, Nixon was an incumbent president who won re-election in a landslide victory, the largest popular vote margin in United States history. Reagan\u2019s 1984 victory was another case of incumbency and an extremely popular candidate. In the following election, Bush narrowly won 51% of the Maryland popular vote.\n\nWhile Maryland is thought to be a blue state, it\u2019s generally agreed that the 2024 election\u2019s swing states are Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin; some include North Carolina in the list as well. Are there \u201cswing\u201d counties in Maryland?\n\nThree counties switched sides between the last two elections: Frederick, Kent and Talbot voted for Trump in 2016, but Biden won in those three counties in 2020.\n\nKent could qualify as a swing county. Voters there chose the Democratic candidate three times out of the last nine elections, and the voting margins were typically small: in four elections, merely a fraction of a percentage point decided the county\u2019s popular vote. Kent is also the state\u2019s least populous county, with about 19,000 residents, according to 2020 U.S. census data.\n\n\u201cThe balance of politics within a small population can change radically with relatively small changes in the population itself,\u201d Crenson explained.\n\nBiden won Frederick County by about 10 percentage points in 2020. The three previous general elections in the county were close, with the Republican candidate winning in each case by less than four percentage points. Crenson said that Frederick County is becoming more politically divided as it becomes \u201ca suburb of Washington.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe result is that federal employees, most of whom vote Democratic, are beginning to populate Frederick County and taking over its electorate,\u201d Crenson said.\n\nIn fact, the voting habits along the entire I-95 corridor are subject to influence from the nation\u2019s capital, Crenson said.\n\n\u201cGovernment employees tend to have rather high levels of education and recently\u2014that is, within the last 10 or 15 years\u2014people with college degrees have been gravitating toward the Democratic Party.\u201d\n\nMaryland voter turnout\u2014the percentage of registered voters who cast a ballot\u2014also took a dip from 74% in 2012 to about 72% in 2016. A change in voter turnout under five percentage points is typical, but 2016 was the lowest voter turnout since 1996, the general election between Democrat Bill Clinton and Republican Bob Dole.\n\n\u201cNeither of the two candidates electrified Maryland,\u201d Crenson said.\n\nThe 2024 election will be the first general election after the COVID-19 pandemic. For the last election, which took place at the onset of the pandemic, the Maryland State Board of Elections restricted poll voting and encouraged voters to request and complete mail-in ballots\u2014which accounted for a majority of all Maryland ballots.\n\nThe results of the 2024 election will establish whether many Marylanders continue to vote by mail or return to the polls. Crenson predicts that mail-in ballots will likely continue to be the avenue for many voters.",

        "text": "Who are US vice presidential candidates Tim Walz and JD Vance?\nThe two candidates offer insights into the trends and forces on the rise in the Democratic and Republican parties.\n\nThe presidential race between Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris and Republican former President Donald Trump appears tight with just over a month to go until the November 5 United States election.\n\nBoth sides are now looking for potential advantages wherever they can find them, and one place will be in their vice presidential candidates, who are set for a nationally televised debate on Tuesday.\n\nWith Trump so far declining a second debate with Harris, the vice presidential debate between Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz and Republican counterpart JD Vance could mark the last time candidates from each campaign meet face to face before the election.\n\nDiffering backgrounds\n\nVance\u2019s and Walz\u2019s rise to the second slot on their respective tickets offers signs of the rising trends in their respective parties. So do their backgrounds.\n\nWalz, the Democratic nominee, has spent more than two decades in elected office.\n\nHe was born in a small rural town in the state of Nebraska and attended Chadron State College, earning a degree in social sciences and joining the National Guard. After university, he spent a year teaching overseas in China before returning to the US to pursue a career as a high school teacher and football coach.\n\nWalz served a total 24 years in the National Guard, before retiring from the armed forces in 2005. He won his first political race in 2006, when he became a member of the US House of Representatives for a district in Minnesota \u2013 his wife\u2019s home state, where he had moved in the mid-1990s.\n\nHe went on to win five more two-year terms in Congress before being elected Minnesota\u2019s governor in 2018. He was reelected in 2022, winning each race by a healthy margin. While in office, Walz embraced progressive policies such as universal free lunches for schoolchildren and easing restrictions on abortion.\n\nVance, by comparison, is a relative newcomer to national politics. He enlisted in the US Marines in 2005, working as a military correspondent in Iraq. Neither Walz nor Vance ever saw combat.\n\nAfter his time in the military, Vance attended college at Ohio State University and Yale Law School before going on to work as a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley, where he strengthened connections with financiers such as Peter Thiel, a right-wing billionaire who would later help bankroll Vance\u2019s entry into politics.\n\nBut Vance first entered the national spotlight as the author of a bestselling memoir titled Hillbilly Elegy in 2016. The book tells the story of Vance\u2019s often difficult upbringing in Ohio, including his mother\u2019s struggles with drug addiction and his difficulty fitting in at elite institutions like Yale Law School.\n\nIt was praised by some as a window into rural, working-class parts of the country that suffered from economic deindustrialisation, while others criticised it as a simplistic and patronising assessment of life in the rural US.\n\nVance first entered politics in 2022 when he ran for an open Senate seat in Ohio.\n\nWhile Vance was previously an outspoken opponent of Trump, dubbing him \u201cAmerica\u2019s Hitler\u201d and a \u201creprehensible\u201d person, he leaned into Trump\u2019s populist right-wing style of politics during that run, promoting Trump\u2019s false claims that he was the true winner of the 2020 election and backing his scheme to remain in office despite losing.\n\nThat helped Vance win Trump\u2019s endorsement, putting him ahead of other Republicans in the party primary. Vance arrived in the Senate after beating Democratic rival Tim Ryan in the general election.\n\nWhile the choice of a vice presidential candidate often has little impact on the outcome of a presidential race, they are often selected to help \u201cbalance\u201d a ticket, helping counter perceived shortcomings in a presidential candidate.\n\nWalz, as a popular governor from the Midwest with a track record of promoting progressive causes while maintaining the trust of more moderate voters, could help Democrats shore up support in key Midwestern states.\n\nJoining Harris on the campaign trail, Walz\u2019s plainspoken and affable personality has made him popular. The polling aggregator 538 says that 40 percent of voters see him favourably, with 36 percent viewing him unfavourably.\n\nVance, on the other hand, was seen as a pick made to signal affinity with the \u201cMAGA wing\u201d of the Republican Party, referring to Make America Great Again, Trump\u2019s longtime rallying cry.\n\nVance was chosen when Trump still expected to face Democratic President Joe Biden \u2013 severely hampered by low popularity and concerns about his age \u2013 in the presidential election, and the campaign may not have felt the need to appeal to a broader, more moderate range of voters.\n\nVance\u2019s positions on issues such as abortion and immigration have been a problem for the campaign, with clips of Vance referring to unmarried women as \u201cchildless cat ladies\u201d and his support for a nationwide abortion ban doing little to endear him to voters.\n\nHe has also attracted controversy by continuing to push false claims vilifying Haitian migrants, accusing them of eating animals. Pollster 538 shows Vance with a net unfavourability rating of about 11.3 percent, compared to a net favourability of about 3.8 percent for Walz.\n\nWhat can we expect at the debate?\n\nWith the stakes high, both candidates will be looking to make an impression at Tuesday\u2019s debate.\n\nVance may hold a slight advantage: Walz has admitted in the past that he is not a highly talented debater.\n\nBut Walz also has decades of political experience and has proven an effective communicator, and can point to achievements such as providing lunches for schoolchildren and support for labour unions as evidence of the Democratic Party\u2019s support for the working class.\n\nOn the Republican side, Vance will likely hammer away at themes such as immigration and LGBTQ rights, a frequent topic of attack by the Republican Party. And for his part, Vance will zero in on criticism of Walz, including what the Republicans call his weak response to the 2020 George Floyd protests in his state.",

With the campaigns currently neck-and-neck in the polls, and with voting under way in some states, it\u2019s a chance for the would-be vice-presidents to introduce themselves to a wide US audience.\n\nWhile VP debates don\u2019t usually tip the scales much, they could matter in a close race \u2013 and they build profiles for lower-profile politicians who will probably stay on the national scene for years to come.\n\nThe pair will face off just weeks after Donald Trump and Kamala Harris faced off during the ABC debate and just 35 days before the election on 5 November.\n\nHere\u2019s what else to know about tonight\u2019s presidential debate.\n\nWhen is the Walz-Vance debate?\n\nThe 90-minute debate is scheduled to begin at 9pm ET on Tuesday, 1 October. It will take place in New York City and be hosted by CBS News.\n\nWhere can I watch the Walz-Vance debate on TV in the US?\n\nIn the US, the debate will air live on CBS News. It will also be livestreamed on their YouTube channel.\n\nMajor news networks are likely to carry the debate in prime time. PBS will have live coverage of the debate.\n\nIn the UK, the BBC News Channel and BBC One will air the debate, with coverage from 1am-5am BST on Wednesday. In Australia, you can watch the debate on the ABC News Channel.\n\nThe Guardian has a team of reporters in New York City and will be covering the debate on a live blog and through live analysis and news.\n\nWho is moderating the debate?\n\nNorah O\u2019Donnell and Margaret Brennan will serve as moderators for the debate. O\u2019Donnell is the anchor of CBS Evening News, and Brennan is the network\u2019s chief foreign affairs correspondent.\n\nCBS News indicates it is up to Walz and Vance to fact-check their opponents \u2013 not the moderators.\n\nIn the debate between Joe Biden and Donald Trump, moderators did not offer fact checks. In the debate between Harris and Trump, moderators weighed in to correct the record on the former president\u2019s misleading claims on topics ranging from abortion to Project 2025.\n\nCBS says a QR code will appear on screen for portions of the debate. Viewers can scan the code to follow the outlet\u2019s live coverage and analysis \u2013 including fact checks \u2013 of the debate on their website. Moderators will be primarily focused on facilitating the debate and enforcing the rules of the debate, CBS said.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Stakes \u2014 Presidential Transition Free newsletter We will guide you through the aftermath of the US election and the transition to a Trump presidency Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In 2020, Buttigieg was the stand-in for then vice-presidential candidate Mike Pence. Meanwhile, Minnesota representative Tom Emmer is serving as the Walz stand-in as Vance prepares for Tuesday night.\n\nView image in fullscreen Can\u2019t get enough of the US election?

The moderator retains the ability to mute their microphones, however. There will be two commercial breaks.\n\nThe candidates will appear behind lecterns \u2013 a departure from the seated format of previous election cycles, including 2020 when Harris and Pence faced off.\n\nVance and Walz will have two minutes for closing statements. Vance won a virtual coin toss and elected to get the last word.\n\nWill there be a second Harris-Trump debate?\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether Harris and Trump will participate in a second debate. The vice-president challenged Trump to another debate, telling a crowd earlier in September that her opponent \u201cseems to be looking for an excuse\u201d to avoid a second confrontation.\n\nHarris said she accepted a CNN invitation for a debate on 23 October, but Trump said it was already \u201ctoo late\u201d for a second matchup.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too late to do another, I\u2019d love to in many ways but it\u2019s too late, the voting is cast, the voters are out there, immediately \u2013 is everybody voting, please? Get out and vote,\u201d Trump said at a rally in North Carolina in late September.\n\nWhen is the presidential election?\n\nVoters head to the polls on 5 November.",

        "text": "Three IRGC Cyber Actors Indicted for \u2018Hack-and-Leak\u2019 Operation Designed to Influence the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election\n\u201cThe Justice Department today announced the unsealing of an indictment charging Iranian nationals, and Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) employees, Masoud Jalili, 36, also known as, \u0645\u0633\u0639\u0648\u062f \u062c\u0644\u06cc\u0644\u06cc, Seyyed Ali Aghamiri, 34, also known as, \u0633\u06cc\u062f \u0639\u0644\u06cc \u0622\u0642\u0627\u0645\u06cc\u0631\u06cc, and Yaser Balaghi, 37, also known as, \u06cc\u0627\u0633\u0631 \u0628\u0644\u0627\u063a\u06cc (the Conspirators), with a conspiracy with others known and unknown to hack into accounts of current and former U.S. officials, members of the media, nongovernmental organizations, and individuals associated with U.S. political campaigns. The activity was part of Iran\u2019s continuing efforts to stoke discord, erode confidence in the U.S. electoral process, and unlawfully acquire information relating to current and former U.S. officials that could be used to advance the malign activities of the IRGC, including ongoing efforts to avenge the death of Qasem Soleimani, the former commander of the IRGC \u2013 Qods Force (IRGC-QF).\u201d\n\n\u201cAs alleged, in or around May, after several years of focusing on compromising the accounts of former U.S. government officials, the conspirators used some of the same hacking infrastructure from earlier in the conspiracy to begin targeting and successfully gaining unauthorized access to personal accounts belonging to persons associated with an identified U.S. Presidential campaign (U.S. Presidential Campaign 1), including campaign officials. The conspirators used their access to those accounts to steal, among other information, non-public campaign documents and emails (campaign material). The activity broadened in late June, when the conspirators engaged in a \u2018hack-and-leak; operation, in which they sought to weaponize campaign material stolen from U.S. Presidential Campaign 1 by leaking such materials to members of the media and individuals associated with what was then another identified U.S. Presidential campaign (U.S. Presidential Campaign 2), in a deliberate effort to, as reflected in the conspirators\u2019 own words and actions, undermine U.S. Presidential Campaign 1 in advance of the 2024 U.S. presidential election.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs alleged in the indictment, beginning in or around January 2020, Jalili, Aghamiri, and Balaghi, working on behalf of the IRGC, commenced a wide-ranging hacking campaign that used spearphishing and social engineering techniques to target and compromise victims computers and accounts. Among the conspirators\u2019 techniques were: using virtual private networks and virtual private servers to obscure their true location; creating fraudulent email accounts in the names of prominent U.S. persons and international institutions; creating spoofed login pages to harvest account credentials; sending spearphishing emails using compromised victim accounts; and using social engineering to obtain victims\u2019 login information and multi-factor recovery/authentication codes. Some of the conspirators\u2019 efforts were successful, while others were not.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn April 2019, the Department of State designated the IRGC as a foreign terrorist organization. Among the purposes of the conspiracy were for the conspirators to: (i) steal victims\u2019 data, such as information related to U.S. government and foreign policy information concerning the Middle East; (ii) steal information relating to current and former U.S. officials that could be used to advance the IRGC\u2019s malign activities; (iii) disrupt U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East; (iv) stoke discord and erode confidence in the U.S. electoral process; (v) steal personal and private information from persons who had access to information relating to U.S. Presidential Campaign 1, including non-public campaign material and information; and (vi) undermine U.S. Presidential Campaign 1 in advance of the 2024 U.S. presidential election by leaking stolen campaign material and information.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs reflected in the Sept. 18 joint statement released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, FBI, and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency: \u2018Iranian malicious cyber actors in late June and early July sent unsolicited emails to individuals then associated with President Biden\u2019s campaign that contained an excerpt taken from stolen, non-public material from former Trump\u2019s campaign as text in the emails. There is currently no information indicating those recipients replied. Furthermore, Iranian malicious cyber actors have continued their efforts since June to send stolen, non-public material associated with former President Trump\u2019s campaign to U.S. media organizations.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cAs alleged in further detail in the indictment, the conspirators\u2019 hack-and-leak efforts involved the conspirators emailing stolen campaign material to individuals that the conspirators believed were associated with what was then U.S. Presidential Campaign 2 and members of the media.\u201d\n\n\u201cFirst, between on or about June 27 and July 3, the conspirators sent or forwarded an unsolicited email message to personal accounts of three persons that the conspirators believed were associated with U.S. Presidential Campaign 2. The June 27 email was sent to two recipients, and then forwarded the same day to another account for one of those recipients (due to the earlier email being sent to an invalid account for that recipient). This email chain contained campaign material stolen from an official for U.S. Presidential Campaign 1 (U.S. Victim 11). Neither of the recipients replied to the conspirators\u2019 email. In addition, the conspirators sent a follow up email on July 3rd to a third recipient\u2019s account, and the recipient similarly did not reply to the Conspirators.\u201d\n\n\u201cSecond, between on or about July 22 and on or about Aug. 31, the conspirators distributed other campaign material stolen from U.S. Victim 11 regarding U.S. Presidential Campaign 1\u2019s potential vice-presidential candidates to multiple members of the news media, in an attempt to induce the news media to publish the material. In one instance, for example, the conspirators\u2019 message stated \u201c\u2019I think this information is worth a good [U.S. news publication] piece with your narration. Let me know your thoughts.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cAs alleged, these defendants also sought to promote the IRGC\u2019s goals and mission by compromising and maintaining unauthorized access to the email accounts of a number of former government officials, including U.S. Victim 1, who had served in a position with responsibility over U.S. Middle East policy at the time of Qasam Soleimani\u2019s death. Using this access, the defendants obtained information to assist the IRGC\u2019s efforts to target U.S. Victim 1 and others, including their means of identification, correspondence, travel information, lodging information and other information regarding their whereabouts and policy positions.\u201d (Source: US Department of Justice)",

She said she wanted to \"remind Americans of just how calamitous being associated with Trump can be, even for those who are convinced he's on their side\"",
        "text": "'Trump took my dad', says Rudy Giuliani's daughter as she backs Kamala Harris\nCaroline Rose Giuliani, the daughter of Donald Trump's former lawyer Rudy Giuliani, has endorsed Democratic nominee Kamala Harris for the upcoming US presidential election and declared that she was \"grieving the loss of my dad to Trump. I cannot bear to lose our country to him too\".\n\nIn an article for Vanity Fair magazine, Caroline Rose Giuliani said that she wanted to \"remind Americans of just how calamitous being associated with Trump can be, even for those who are convinced he\u2019s on their side\".\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"Watching my dad\u2019s life crumble since he joined forces with Trump has been extraordinarily painful, both on a personal level and because his demise feels linked to a dark force that threatens to once again consume America,\" she added.\n\nRudy Giuliani, a politician and lawyer, served as the Mayor of New York City from 2001 to 2004. He formally joined Trump's personal legal team in April 2018, almost two years after advising the latter during his first presidential campaign in 2016.\n\nHe remained on Trump's team during the 2020 election.\n\nCaroline Giuliani's endorsement of Harris came a week after a federal appeals court on September 23 permanently disbarred Rudy Giuliani from practising law in Washington D.C. for the efforts he made to discredit the 2020 election results and prevent the transition of power after Trump lost the polls.\n\n\"I am constantly asking myself how America is back here, even considering the possibility of electing Donald Trump again, after all the damage he has caused, both in office and since... There are unmistakable reminders of Trump\u2019s destructive trail all around us, and it has broken my heart to watch my dad become one of them.\"\n\nIn the article, she said that the US Vice President had gained \"extraordinary momentum\" by infusing vitality and hope in her election campaign.\n\nShe cited Harris's stand on issues like reproductive rights, the economy, foreign and environmental policy as reasons for her endorsement.\n\n\"We need experienced, sane, and fundamentally decent leaders who will fight for us instead of against us\u2014who will safeguard our democracy rather than dismantle it... I need to advocate for a future worth bringing children into, which is why I am voicing my adamant support for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz,\" Caroline Giuliani declared.\n\nShe also called Harris the \"only candidate who cares about my rights as a woman\".\n\n\"Seeing Republican state officials enact draconian abortion bans and threaten fertility care is incredibly personal for me... Hearing Trump flip-flop on the issues of abortion and IVF only makes me trust him less \u2013 if that\u2019s even possible \u2013 because his lies are so clearly politically motivated. He\u2019s already caused irreparable damage, and I don\u2019t believe for a second that he won\u2019t cause more.\"\n\nFurther intensifying her attacks against the former President, Caroline Giuliani said Trump is \"a 34-time convicted felon who\u2019s been found liable for sexual abuse, tries to steal elections, and demeans people based on their race, sexuality, disability status, and gender falls remarkably short of the bar we must set for ourselves as a country\".\n\n\"Fortunately, we have another choice in this election: a life-long public servant who has spent her career upholding justice and fighting for those who cannot fight for themselves,\" she added.\n\nThis is not the first time that Caroline Giuliani has endorsed a Democrat for President over Trump.\n\nIn 2016, she also reportedly supported the Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, saying on Facebook that she was \u201cpro-Hillary all along\u201d.",

But as people prepare to head to the polls, both voters and election administrators face threats and intimidation from those trying to subvert the democratic process.\n\nUS election officials should be able to do their jobs in safety. Nevertheless, election administrators in Colorado and Arizona have faced online threats, Michigan administrators received threatening voicemails, and some in Georgia, Nevada, California, Oregon, and Washington were sent fentanyl-laced letters. One survey found one in four local election administrators experienced abuse, harassment, or threats during the last two election cycles.\n\nPlay Video\n\nVoters also need protection. In a 2022 survey, 43 percent of respondents reported concerns about intimidation or threats of violence while voting. Earlier this year, Texas officials appealed a court ruling that overturned a voting fraud conviction against Crystal Mason, a Black woman, for attempting to cast a provisional ballot while on probation. Such extreme prosecutions can intimidate eligible voters, especially those who have had experiences in or with the criminal system.\n\nRecent polling suggests that 97 percent of naturalized citizens are likely to exercise their legal right to vote this November. But in Tennessee, the state government has sent letters to over 14,000 naturalized citizens asking them to prove their citizenship before casting their ballots. Meanwhile, authorities in Texas are asking people in the state to submit tips on perceived illegal voting. These actions may lead to an increase in harassment and disenfranchisement of Latinx or naturalized citizen voters.\n\nWhile these concerns are real, the United States is thankfully home to a vibrant network of democracy protection activists, organizations, and attorneys with a long history of effectively pushing back on violations of the rights of voters and election administrators alike. Human rights standards also provide governments, including those at the US federal, state, and local levels, with clear guidance on administering fair elections.\n\nGovernment officials and the voting public can follow 10 basic principles to protect rights in the upcoming elections and ensure a safe, nonthreatening environment now and in the future.",

The historic democratic transformations in the aftermath of the collapse of Soviet Communism have been followed by nearly two decades of democratic backsliding including in the OSCE region .",
        "text": "Warsaw Human Dimension Conference I Plenary Session 2: Democratic Institutions\nDemocracy at the national, regional and local levels\n\nDemocratic elections\n\nAs prepared for delivered by Charg\u0117 d\u2019Affaires Katherine Brucker\n\nWarsaw, October 1, 2024\n\nAs we prepare for our national elections this November, the United States is pleased once again to welcome an OSCE observer mission, and others should do the same. The United States strongly supports the work of OSCE\u2019s Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights. It serves as a valuable resource to participating States that strive to put their democracy commitments into practice.\n\nIn 1990, participating States adopted the Charter of Paris, pledging \u201cto build, consolidate and strengthen democracy as the only system of government of our nations.\u201d Today, our democracy work within the OSCE is more vital than ever.\n\nThe historic democratic transformations in the aftermath of the collapse of Soviet Communism have been followed by nearly two decades of democratic backsliding including in the OSCE region. In too many nations, basic civil and political rights are under siege. Brave individuals who stand up in defense of the democratic aspirations of their fellow citizens are targets of repression.\n\nRussia continues to go through the motions of holding elections with no real choices and no real debate in the midst of intensifying repression and censorship of civil society and independent media. March Presidential and September Parliamentary elections were no different: The outcomes were pre-determined. Non-Kremlin-approved candidates were not permitted on the ballot. Objective international observation missions were not welcome. Putin\u2019s primary challenger Alexei Navalny died in February in custody in a remote Artic penal colony. The Constitution has been changed to allow Putin to rule in Russia for 25 years, with possibly more to come. Russia held its elections in Ukraine\u2019s sovereign territory without Ukraine\u2019s consent.\n\nBelarus has not had a free and fair election since Lukashenka was first elected in 1994. Since then, the Lukashenka regime has worked to strip Belarusians of political and civil rights to ensure unchecked power for itself. Political repression in Belarus has hit an all-time high. Presidential elections are slated for 2025, former presidential candidates and their teams are among the roughly 1,400 political prisoners. Those not jailed have been forced into exile and subjected to trials in absentia. The United States welcomes the recent release of some political prisoners over the past three months but notes that these releases have been paired with new arrests. The United States calls for the unconditional release of all political prisoners in Belarus.\n\nAzerbaijan\u2019s early presidential election in February was conducted in a restrictive environment hostile to dissent and was devoid of genuine competition. In its findings following the September parliamentary elections, ODIHR concluded that they \u201ctook place in a restrictive political and legal environment that does not enable genuine pluralism and resulted in a contest devoid of competition\u2026the legal framework for the elections does not meet international standards or OSCE commitments for democratic elections on restrictions introduced into political party and media legislation further limit fundamental freedoms.\u201d\n\nT\u00fcrkiye continues to impose restrictions on the political opposition, including the imprisonment of former presidential candidate Selahattin Demirta\u015f. The government also has removed democratically elected, pro-Kurdish mayors from office in the southeast.\n\nFollowing the March 2023 parliamentary elections in Kazakhstan, the OSCE noted that the government has not approved registration of several aspiring political parties, and deregistered others. At least three leaders of unregistered parties remained incarcerated.\n\nWe look forward to the OSCE assessment of the upcoming elections in Uzbekistan. ODIHR\u2019s Needs Assessment Mission report concluded that aspects of the process that need to be reviewed included the legal framework, the work of the election commissions at all levels, voter and candidate registration, media coverage of the campaign, and the system for dispute resolution. For example, previous OSCE reports have raised concerns about the difficulty \u201cfor genuinely independent political parties to organize, nominate candidates, and campaign. The Ministry of Justice has the power to suspend parties for as long as six months without a court order.\u201d\n\nSerbia reran Belgrade city assembly elections in tandem with municipal elections following protests against irregularities in the first round of municipal and parliamentary elections in late 2023. These included according to ODIHR \u201cbias in the media, pressure on public sector employees, misuse of public resources,\u201d as well as \u201cinconsistent application of safeguards during voting and counting, frequent instances of overcrowding, breaches of secrecy of the vote, and numerous instances of group voting.\u201d ODIHR found the June 2024 elections were generally well administered but there were concerns about the misuse of state resources, influence on the media by the authorities, and an unaudited voter registry. Serbia formed a working group on election reform, but with little progress thus far. We urge Serbian authorities to adopt ODIHR recommendations.\n\nHungary employed government apparatuses, including the State Audit Office and the Sovereignty Protection Office, to target the political opposition ahead of June 2024 local and EU elections through punitive fines and smear campaigns to undermine fair electoral competition. Hungary has not taken sufficient steps to prevent the abuse of public office for campaign purposes and the misuse of administrative resources, despite previous recommendations by ODIHR.\n\nNorth Macedonia\u2019s May 2024 parliamentary and presidential elections highlighted growing public distrust of democratic processes. OHDIR noted the government respected fundamental freedoms, but pointed to an electoral process that remains poorly regulated. The expedited process to amend the Electoral Code ahead of the May elections lacked transparency and public consultation.\n\nMoldova\u2019s 2023 and 2024 local elections were free and fair despite Russia\u2019s attempts to sabotage them and install Russia-backed politicians through illicit financing and vote buying. In June, along with the UK and Canada, we exposed Russia\u2019s plans to undermine Moldova\u2019s October presidential elections. Russia is currently illicitly supporting candidates for Moldova\u2019s presidency. OSCE partners must remain involved in ensuring fairness in the country\u2019s current electoral campaign, culminating in just a few weeks.\n\nArmenia has taken commendable strides to advance democratic reforms and to address widespread corruption. More remains to be done. We remain committed to working with Armenia towards its goal of a more democratic future.\n\nThe Georgian government\u2019s passage and implementation of the Foreign Influence Law, voter intimidation, and recent reports of the weaponization of the Georgian Anti-Corruption Bureau to stifle domestic and international election monitoring efforts have severely undermined the country\u2019s democratic processes and institutions in advance of its October parliamentary elections. Through violent clamp downs on protests, the harassment of writers and artists, and the move to pass pernicious anti-LGBT legislation, the ruling Georgian Dream party has stifled the exercise of the freedoms of association and expression, stigmatized organizations that serve the citizens of Georgia, and impeded independent media outlets. There have also been reports of intimidation and harassment of civil society and the political opposition that have included beatings, threats to their families, the vandalization of their personal property.\n\nAs President Biden often says, democracy doesn\u2019t happen by accident. We must defend democratic principles and practices constantly. We all must confront our shortcomings, even when it\u2019s uncomfortable. Democracy remains the single most powerful tool for unleashing human potential and delivering results for people everywhere. Defending it throughout the OSCE region is an essential core mission of this organization.\n\n###",

Same-day, in-person voting is not available outside the United States. Many states require voted ballots to reach local election officials by the time polls close on election day (Tuesday, November 5). U.S. citizens who want to participate in the 2024 U.S. elections from overseas should have already returned their absentee ballots to their local election officials.\n\nNever received your ballot?\n\nIf you registered to vote and requested an absentee ballot prior to your state\u2019s registration deadline, but have not yet received your ballot, you can complete a Federal Write-in Absentee Ballot (FWAB) and return it to your local election office. The FWAB is available at www.FVAP.gov. If your regular ballot arrives later, complete and return it as well. Your FWAB will only be counted if your regular ballot does not reach local election officials by your state\u2019s deadline. Your vote will not be counted twice.\n\nRETURNING YOUR BALLOT:\n\nIf you plan to drop your ballot off at the Embassy to be returned to your local election office, we recommend you do so no later than October 4. Please ensure your ballot is addressed to your local election officials and is either placed in a postage-paid envelope or bears sufficient domestic U.S. postage.\n\nIn-Person: U.S. citizens may drop off election forms and ballots at our ballot drop-off box, which is available at U.S. Embassy Seoul\u2019s rear gate 24/7. Envelopes must have the U.S. postage-paid label or contain sufficient U.S. postage to be delivered to your local election office.\n\nBy Mail: To mail election-related materials to the United States, you will need two envelopes:\n\n(1) Address the first (outer) envelope to the U.S. Embassy Seoul at mailing address:\n\n188 Sejong-daero, Jongno-gu, Seoul 03141\n\nAttention: American Citizen Services (Ballot)\n\n(2) Address the second (inner) envelope to your local state election office using the postage-paid envelope and enclose your ballot inside. Seal the second (inner) envelope, place it inside the first (outer) envelope, and mail the package to U.S. Embassy Seoul.\n\nPlease note that election materials only need to contain sufficient U.S. postage or be placed in a postage-paid envelope. Printable postage-paid envelope templates are available on FVAP\u2019s website.\n\nMissed the U.S. Embassy shipment deadline?\n\nIf your state allows, you may be able to return your voted ballot to your local election office electronically. You can also consider returning your ballot via an express courier service at your own expense. Ballots sent via express courier do not receive standard postmarks, so voters using this method should confirm delivery on or before November 5 prior to payment and shipment. Check your state\u2019s voting procedures at www.FVAP.gov for guidance.\n\nIf you have previously registered to vote and requested an absentee ballot but it has not yet arrived, some states allow voters to email or fax their voted, signed Federal Write-in Absentee Ballots to local election officials. Review your state\u2019s voting procedures at www.FVAP.gov carefully for guidance.\n\nReturning your ballot by international mail.\n\nIf using Korea\u2019s postal system, be sure to include sufficient international postage, and allow enough time for delivery. Ballots sent via regular international mail at this point are unlikely to reach local election officials by state ballot receipt deadlines.\n\nHELP SPREAD THE WORD ABOUT OVERSEAS VOTING.\n\nPlease help spread the word to your friends, family, and colleagues that now is the time return your ballot if you are voting from overseas.\n\nHave Questions?\n\nPlease contact U.S. Embassy Seoul\u2019s Voting Assistance Officer at SeoulInfoACS@state.gov. You can also contact the Federal Voting Assistance Program directly at Vote@FVAP.gov.\n\nConfirm your registration and ballot delivery online. Learn more at the Federal Voting Assistance Program\u2019s (FVAP) website at www.FVAP.gov.\n\nLaunch of the New Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) \u2013 Re-Enroll Now!\n\nOn September 16, 2024, the Department of State launched a new version of the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP).

You can read the previous edition here. Sign up for free here to get it on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Email us at electioncountdown@ft.com\n\nGood morning and welcome to US Election Countdown.\n\nLet\u2019s kick off October \u2014 and spooky season \u2014 with:\n\nThe vice-presidential debate\n\nHarris\u2019s border visit\n\nThe Pennsylvania voter registration battle\n\nIt\u2019s debate night in America \u2014 probably the last one of the 2024 presidential election cycle.\n\nVice-presidential candidates JD Vance and Tim Walz will take the stage at 9pm in New York City for the CBS News-hosted debate. Vance, with his lacklustre approval ratings, is the candidate who has the most to gain.\n\nHere\u2019s what to watch for during the match-up:\n\n1. Can Vance remedy his image issues?\n\nVance has a likeability problem and, he\u2019ll be eager to shore up his approval ratings \u2014 especially among women.\n\nWalz is viewed more favourably in the Midwest battleground states of Michigan and Wisconsin, as well as in Vance\u2019s home state of Ohio, according to the latest NYT/Siena poll. Nationally, an Associated Press poll last week showed that 57 per cent of registered voters viewed Vance unfavourably compared with 32 per cent who disliked Walz.\n\nDespite the numbers, political operatives are expecting a strong performance from the Ohio senator tonight.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a Yale Law [graduate], smart by all accounts, is pretty good on his feet, so he will probably be ready, and he\u2019s doing a lot of work to get there,\u201d \u200b\u200bMatt Bennett, co-founder of centrist Democratic think-tank Third Way, told me. \u201cHe certainly isn\u2019t going to perform the way Trump did,\u201d referring to the ex-president\u2019s debate performance last month.\n\n2. Who will be the instigator?\n\nOne of Kamala Harris\u2019s best tactics on the debate stage last month was baiting Donald Trump with his most sensitive issues. We can expect Walz and Vance to try to replicate her strategy.\n\n\u201cI would tell [Walz] to not take the bait,\u201d said Bennett. \u201cWhat his running mate did so brilliantly was get Trump to rise every single time . . . and Vance is going to try to do that to him. He\u2019s going to say a bunch of things to get him to react, maybe criticise his military service or attack Harris in ways that are untrue or ridiculous.\u201d\n\nFor Walz\u2019s part, the Democratic vice-presidential pick might tell Vance he is \u201cweird\u201d to his face.\n\nBoth candidates have been preparing in earnest: US transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg has played Vance in Walz\u2019s practice sessions, while US representative Tom Emmer of Minnesota has acted as Walz in Vance\u2019s run-throughs.\n\n3. Will the debate move the dial?\n\nThere are few people who think that what happens tonight will be a poll-moving event, particularly since the headline face-off between Harris and Trump didn\u2019t change much.\n\n\u201cNo VP debate in history has ever really mattered,\u201d \u200b Bennett told me. Republican strategist Doug Heye agreed, noting that undecided voters focused on the fight at the top of the ticket would not change their vote based on tonight \u201cbarring something cataclysmic\u201d.\n\nBut the stakes are still high for the veep candidates as they will have a big platform to pitch themselves to voters \u2014 and perhaps more importantly, their bosses\n\nCampaign clips: the latest election headlines\n\nThe MAGA Patriot AR-15 \u00a9 Patriot Training Center\n\nBehind the scenes\n\nIn the swing state of Arizona on Friday Harris pledged a crackdown on illegal immigration, moving rightward from both Democrats\u2019 traditional stance on the hot-button issue and even Biden\u2019s tough stance.\n\n\u201cThe United States is a sovereign nation and I believe we have the duty to set rules at our border and to enforce them,\u201d she said. Her tougher rhetoric is part of an effort to narrow the polling gap on immigration, which has been one of Trump\u2019s strongest issues throughout the race [free to read].\n\nKamala Harris during a visit to the US-Mexico border in Arizona last month \u00a9 AFP via Getty Images\n\nIn the border town of Douglas, voters told the FT\u2019s Myles McCormick that they liked seeing the vice-president and described how important border security was to the local population.\n\n\u201cI believe I would vote for her,\u201d said Jennifer Valenzuela, a 28-year-old stay-at-home mother. \u201cIt just depends [on what she says about the border],\u201d she added, noting \u201cmore security\u201d would make her more likely to do so.\n\nLinda Rojas, a 68-year-old who works from home, said she was also glad Harris visited. \u201cI definitely think that she needs a tougher approach and just look at things and get a perspective as to how it is on the border and see [if] she can implement anything new.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think one thing is seeing it and another thing is hearing about it,\u201d said Sarah Foreman, 57, a caretaker.\n\nTrump is leading Harris by 1.3 percentage points in Arizona, according to the FT\u2019s poll tracker.\n\nDatapoint\n\nIt\u2019s hard to overstate the importance of Pennsylvania in this election.\n\nWith its whopping 20 electoral votes (the most of any swing state), the candidate who wins Pennsylvania would be considered the favourite to clinch the presidency.\n\nHarris and Trump are both frequent visitors to the state, and have spent a combined $300mn on ads, more than anywhere else. Both parties are also rushing to sign up new voters \u2014 and Republicans are winning this race.\n\nPennsylvania is home to more registered Democrats than Republicans overall, but the gap has narrowed; the split was 51-37 in 2008, but is now 44-40.\n\nTwo weeks ago Republicans registered 12,615 new voters to the Democrats\u2019 7,940. A further 7,404 were registered as \u201cunaffiliated\u201d or with \u201cother parties\u201d, according to state data released last week.\n\nHarris will almost certainly take Philadelphia County, which encompasses the eponymous city; Biden won it by 64 points in 2020. But the biggest question is whether enough people will turn out to vote in the county to win her the state.\n\nViewpoints",

        "text": "U.S. dockworkers strike over wages and automation in fight that could lead to shortages \u2022 Rhode Island Current\nELIZABETH, N.J. \u2014 Tens of thousands of dockworkers went on strike from Texas to Maine on Tuesday to demand higher wages and a ban on all automation at ports in a move that could snarl supply chains only a month ahead of the presidential election.\n\nThe International Longshoremen\u2019s Association union and the United States Maritime Alliance, which represents employers in the longshore industry, were unable to reach a new contract agreement. This is the union\u2019s first strike since 1977, when dockworkers stopped work for several weeks.\n\nMore than 500 union members gathered at the gates of Maher Terminals in Elizabeth, New Jersey early Tuesday for the start of the strike. Harold Daggett, International President of the ILA, rallied the crowd as he spoke at one of the main container terminal operators at Port Newark\u2013Elizabeth Marine Terminal, an important facility for goods entering the New York Metropolitan area.\n\n\u201cThese greedy corporations, everything they got, they got from us. We\u2019re the ones who worked through the pandemic to make them the money they got,\u201d Daggett said in an interview.\n\nWhen asked how long the strike would last, Daggett said that union members will stay on strike \u201cuntil the end.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, the ILA said employers were price-gouging customers by charging much more for containers, which would lead to higher prices for consumers. It stated that the wages offered by USMX were still too low to accept.\n\n\u201cThe Ocean Carriers represented by USMX want to enjoy rich billion-dollar profits that they are making in 2024, while they offer ILA Longshore Workers an unacceptable wage package that we reject,\u201d the union said in a statement. \u201cILA longshore workers deserve to be compensated for the important work they do keeping American commerce moving and growing.\u201d\n\nScott Weiss, a member of ILA Local 1804-1, inspects containers that come off of ships entering at Port Newark\u2013Elizabeth Marine Terminal, as well the chassis of the trucks that then carry the containers filled with goods away to destinations all along the East Coast.\n\nWeiss said that the union is asking for wage increases that can cover the cost of inflation, and that a human eye is still needed to do his job right, even in the face of increasing automation.\n\n\u201cEmployers push automation under the guise of safety, but it\u2019s really about cutting labor costs to increase their already exceptionally high profits. Automation of our nation\u2019s ports should be a concern for everyone,\u201d he said. \u201cThe truth is robots do not pay taxes, and they do not spend money in their communities.\u201d\n\nThe union said it will continue to handle military cargo and work passenger cruise ships.\n\nBefore the strike began, USMX said it offered a wage increase of nearly 50% and increasing employer contributions to employee retirement plans. USMX said their offer would still retain the same language on automation. The employers filed an unfair labor practice complaint on Wednesday with the National Labor Relations Board in which they accused the union of refusing to come to the bargaining table.\n\n\u201cIn the last 24 hours, the USMX and ILA have traded counter offers related to wages. The USMX increased our offer and has also requested an extension of the current Master Contract, now that both sides have moved off their previous positions. We are hopeful that this could allow us to fully resume collective bargaining around the other outstanding issues \u2013 in an effort to reach an agreement,\u201d USMX said in a statement Monday.\n\nVoters remain laser-focused on the economy heading into the Nov. 5 election. Eighty-one percent of registered voters say the economy is very important to their vote for president this November, according to a poll published last month from the nonpartisan Pew Research Center.\n\nLauren Saidel-Baker, a speaker and economist at ITR Economics, a nonpartisan economic research and consulting firm based in New Hampshire, said that the longer the strike goes on, the greater the impact will be on inflation. Inflation cooled significantly enough for the Federal Reserve to cut the federal funds rate by half a percentage point last month.\n\n\u201cIf this is just a week, again, there will be short-term disruptions and maybe things take a little bit longer to get where they\u2019re going. That could be a risk for perishable items,\u201d she said.\n\nThe supply chain issues that affected retail prices at the beginning of the pandemic may have prepared businesses for some disruption, she said, and this could mitigate some of the effects for consumers in the short term.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a very unique situation where we just had this major, major supply chain disruption that caused a lot of American businesses to make contingency plans in a way that they just haven\u2019t in the past. We have creativity and increased flexibility that will help us if this is just a brief disruption,\u201d she said. \u201cWe still have elevated inventories in some sectors, so there might be a little bit more buffer in certain goods getting where they\u2019re going.\u201d\n\nAside from the economic effects on consumers, strikes can have spillover effects on other groups of workers. If dockworkers secure a strong contract as the result of this strike, it could affect other industries. Alexander Hertel-Fernandez, associate professor of international and public Affairs at Columbia University, and former deputy assistant secretary for research and evaluation at the U.S. Department of Labor, said the success of auto worker strikes and the Hollywood strikes may have emboldened union dockworkers.\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019re likely to see other industries, particularly those most closely aligned with, um, transportation and logistics, really pick up the baton on that, especially if the economic and political environment continues to be favorable to them,\u201d Hertel-Fernandez said.\n\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce has called on the Biden administration to invoke the Taft-Hartley Act, which allows presidents to intervene in strikes if it creates a national emergency. President Joe Biden has said that he does not plan to do so.\n\nBiden\u2019s position is unlikely to change,Hertel-Fernandez said, because of the politics of the timing.\n\n\u201cI think you would see a pretty negative response from the labor movement if they were to do so,\u201d he said. \u201cGiven that it\u2019s so close to the election, where labor is such an important constituent for the Democrats, that they would be unlikely to do it.\u201d\n\nBonamo reported in Elizabeth for New Jersey Monitor, part of States Newsroom. Quinlan reported from Washington.",

A majority of them were brought by Republicans.\n\n\"It is a deluge,\" said Wendy Weiser, director of the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonpartisan think tank tracking the unprecedented volume of election-year litigation. \"It is a strategy to sow disinformation and chaos in the election system.\"\n\nMany of the lawsuits, predicated on \"conspiracy theories\" and advancing tenuous legal arguments, will ultimately be tossed out on technical grounds, Weiser said. But some may reach the justices with the potential to alter voting procedures in the final weeks of the campaign, depending on how they rule.\n\nIn this Nov. 7, 2020 file photo election personnel sort absentee ballot applications for storage at the Gwinnett County Board of Voter Registrations and Elections offices in Lawrenceville, Ga. Elijah Nouvelage/Getty Images, FILE\n\nIn one closely-watched case from Mississippi, the Republican National Committee has asked a conservative federal appeals court panel to prohibit the counting of mail ballots that arrive after Election Day, even if they are postmarked on or before Nov. 5. Roughly 20 states have long standing laws permitting late-arriving ballots, including Nevada, Virginia and Ohio.\n\n\"They're saying federal law says election day means election day, which means that anything that comes afterwards was not on election day,\" Weiser said of the GOP effort. \"The argument has been raised in many cases across the country, and the courts have been routinely rejecting it. But given the context of the players involved, there's now not a 0% risk that this could happen.\"\n\nIn North Carolina, Republicans have sued state election officials seeking to remove 225,000 voters ahead of election day, claiming voter registration forms lacked the required identification information. The case is among more than three dozen GOP-led suits attempting to purge alleged ineligible voters, according to Democracy Docket, a left-leaning group tracking the litigation.\n\n\"It doesn't strike me as implausible that you would see a case like that sharply before the Supreme Court in late October,\" said University of Chicago law professor Aziz Huq.\n\nWhile the justices have generally sought to avoid interference in state voter registration policies and election procedures close to an election \u2013 a concept known as the Purcell Principle \u2013 they have occasionally issued rulings that have resulted in major changes.\n\nA view of the Supreme Court Building during sunrise on Sept. 5, 2024 in Washington, DC. Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images, FILE\n\nIn the past few weeks, the court has issued decisions allowing Arizona to require proof of citizenship for state voter registration and rejecting Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein's bid to appear on the Nevada ballot.\n\n\"They've never really explained what is the 'status quo' and what is 'last minute,' and they have been incredibly inconsistent in how they applied [Purcell],\" said Caroline Fredrickson, a Georgetown law professor and former president of the American Constitution Society.\n\nOther possible scenarios for Supreme Court involvement in the 2024 election could unfold after Nov. 5, as local and state election officials tabulate ballots and certify results.\n\n\"Imagine a state such as Georgia, where you have a state election board that has in the past weeks evinced a certain tendency to invite and foment election related litigation, resisting certification of a slate of presidential electors that the state election board disfavors,\" said Huq. \"What happens then? Perhaps the Supreme Court would be called in to tell us.\"\n\nThe Electoral Count Reform Act of 2022 (ECRA) mandates that states must certify their results by Dec. 11, but does not spell out what would happen if they do not do so. There could be litigation to resolve the appointment of a state's electors for president by Dec. 16 when the Electoral College meets to cast votes.\n\nThe law explicitly directs disputes over certification to a three-judge panel for resolution with the U.S. Supreme Court getting the final word.\n\n\"It's certainly contemplated as a second layer fail-safe,\" said Weiser, \"but I'm relatively confident that all the earlier layer fail-safes are going to hold and that we're not going to be in that scenario.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi speaks as the House comes back into session to continue the process of certifying the 2020 Electoral College results after Pro-Trump demonstrators stormed the Capitol in Washington, DC on Jan. 6, 2021. Erin Schaff/POOL/AFP via Getty Images, FILE\n\nThe court could also be asked to weigh in on any attempt by members of Congress to disqualify former President Donald Trump from a second term, if he were to win the election, during certification of the electoral vote on Jan. 6, 2025.\n\nIn the case Trump v. Anderson last year, the justices unanimously ruled that states could not disqualify a presidential candidate as an \"insurrectionist\" under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, but it left open a federal process to make that determination.\n\nSection 3 of the 14th Amendment says anyone who took an oath \"as an officer of the United States to support the Constitution\" and who then \"engaged in insurrection or rebellion\" or gave \"aid or comfort to the enemy\" cannot hold office.\n\nTrump's critics allege he clearly violated Section 3 given his connection to the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol and efforts to block certification of President Joe Biden's election victory.\n\nUnder the ECRA, if one-fifth of the members of the House and Senate voted to object to certification of Trump's electors on the grounds that he is ineligible to hold office, that decision could ultimately be reviewed by the Supreme Court.\n\n\"You could imagine a kind of Bush v Gore style, very, very rapid sequence of motions or petitions being filed and making their way through the court system,\" said Huq. \"I can imagine that happening, although I think it's unlikely. But I suspect the Supreme Court would make short work of it.\"",

        "text": "Migrant encounters at U.S.-Mexico border have fallen sharply in 2024\nAfter reaching a record high at the end of 2023, the monthly number of U.S. Border Patrol encounters with migrants crossing into the United States from Mexico has plummeted so far in 2024.\n\nThe Border Patrol recorded 58,038 encounters with migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border in August, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of the latest available government statistics. That was a 77% decline from 249,741 encounters in December 2023, the most ever recorded in a single month.\n\nHow we did this This Pew Research Center analysis examines migration patterns at the U.S.-Mexico border using current and historical data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the federal agency that includes the U.S. Border Patrol. The analysis is based on a metric known as migrant encounters. The term \u201cencounters\u201d can refer to different types of events. In this analysis, it refers to Border Patrol apprehensions of migrants who cross into the United States without authorization. These migrants are taken into custody, at least temporarily, to await a decision on whether they can remain in the U.S. legally, such as by being granted asylum. Migrants who are not granted asylum are typically deported. It is important to note that encounters refer to events, not people, and that some migrants are encountered more than once. As a result, the overall number of encounters is higher than the number of distinct individuals involved. This analysis is limited to monthly encounters between ports of entry involving the Border Patrol. It excludes encounters at ports of entry involving the Office of Field Operations, a federal law enforcement agency within Customs and Border Protection. Public opinion data in this analysis comes from Center surveys conducted in January 2024 and August 2024. Methodological information about these surveys, including their field dates and sample sizes, is available by following the links in the text.\n\nThe decline in encounters has come amid policy changes on both sides of the border. Authorities in Mexico have stepped up enforcement to prevent migrants from reaching the U.S. border. And U.S. President Joe Biden issued an executive order in June that makes it much more difficult for migrants who enter the U.S. without legal permission to seek asylum and remain in the country.\n\nThe term \u201cencounters\u201d can refer to different types of events. In this analysis, it refers to Border Patrol apprehensions of migrants who cross into the U.S. without authorization. These migrants are taken into custody, at least temporarily, to await a decision on whether they can remain in the U.S. legally, such as by being granted asylum. Migrants who are not granted asylum are typically deported.\n\nChanging migration patterns at the border\n\nThe dramatic increase in migrant encounters at the U.S.-Mexico border at the end of 2023 drew widespread criticism from the American public about the government\u2019s handling of the situation, according to a Center survey conducted in early 2024. At the time, 78% of U.S. adults said the large number of migrants seeking to enter the U.S. at the border with Mexico was either a crisis or a major problem. A similar share (80%) said the U.S. government was doing a bad job dealing with the situation.\n\nSince the end of 2023, however, the monthly number of encounters has declined sharply, including large decreases in encounters with citizens of Mexico and the Northern Triangle countries of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. These nations have been among the most common origin countries for migrants encountered at the U.S.-Mexico border in recent years.\n\nThe monthly number of encounters with citizens of Guatemala decreased 81% between December 2023 and August 2024, from 34,693 to 6,420.\n\ndecreased 81% between December 2023 and August 2024, from 34,693 to 6,420. Encounters with citizens of Honduras fell 76%, from 18,993 to 4,465.\n\nfell 76%, from 18,993 to 4,465. Encounters with citizens of El Salvador fell 64%, from 5,818 to 2,076.\n\nfell 64%, from 5,818 to 2,076. Encounters with citizens of Mexico fell 52%, from 56,240 to 26,824.\n\nThere have also been sharp decreases in encounters with citizens of other countries, including some that historically have not been common origin nations for migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nEncounters with citizens of Venezuela plunged 99% between December 2023 and August 2024, from 46,918 to 626.\n\nplunged 99% between December 2023 and August 2024, from 46,918 to 626. Encounters with citizens of Cuba fell 98%, from 4,964 to 104.\n\nfell 98%, from 4,964 to 104. Encounters with citizens of Haiti fell 97%, from 1,392 to 46.\n\nfell 97%, from 1,392 to 46. Encounters with citizens of Nicaragua fell 96%, from 8,176 to 297.\n\nfell 96%, from 8,176 to 297. Encounters with citizens of Peru fell 95%, from 5,742 to 312.\n\nfell 95%, from 5,742 to 312. Encounters with citizens of Ecuador fell 84%, from 16,951 to 2,676.\n\nfell 84%, from 16,951 to 2,676. Encounters with citizens of Colombia fell 80%, from 17,874 to 3,531.\n\nfell 80%, from 17,874 to 3,531. Encounters with citizens of China fell 75%, from 5,951 to 1,472.\n\nIn August, 69% of encounters involved migrants from Mexico or the Northern Triangle region. That was a shift from December 2023, when only 46% did.\n\nThe majority of encounters continue to involve single adults. In August, 62% of all encounters involved single adults, while 27% involved people traveling in families and 11% involved unaccompanied minors. In December 2023, a slightly smaller share of encounters (54%) involved single adults, while 41% involved people traveling in families and 5% involved unaccompanied minors.\n\nImmigration remains key election issue\n\nDespite the large decrease in migrant encounters this year, border security remains a key issue in the 2024 U.S. presidential election, according to a Center survey fielded in August.\n\nIn fact, 88% of registered voters strongly or somewhat favor improving security along the country\u2019s borders. That includes 96% of voters who support former President Donald Trump and 80% of voters who support Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nNote: This is an update of a post originally published on March 15, 2021.",

        "text": "Philosopher Judith Butler on the 2024 US presidential election, gender anxiety and reimagining the future\nKeep up with LAist. If you're enjoying this article, you'll love our daily newsletter, The LA Report. Each weekday, catch up on the 5 most pressing stories to start your morning in 3 minutes or less. Sign Up\n\nIn the lead up to the U.S. presidential election, \"Imperfect Paradise\" will be sitting down with four notable Californians to talk about a range of issues including gender, race and democratic values.\n\nFirst up is renowned philosopher and gender studies scholar Judith Butler, who released their latest book Who\u2019s Afraid of Gender? earlier this year. In the book, Butler traces how right-wing movements have taken up gender ideology as a political target, including in the U.S.\n\nAccording to the ACLU , since 2015, political attacks against LGBTQ people in U.S. state legislatures have grown exponentially. There are currently 530 anti-LGBTQ bills in the U.S.\n\nHow and why did gender become a focal point for the right?\n\nAntonia Cereijido, host of LAist Studio's \"Imperfect Paradise,\" asked Butler to reflect on how they\u2019ve seen these dynamics play out on the political stage ahead of the November elections. Interview excerpts have been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nButler reflects on Republican vice presidential nominee J.D. Vance calling Democrat leaders \u201cchildress cat ladies\u201d:\n\nIt's such a wild act of misogyny on his part to call out so-called \u201cchildless cat ladies.\" It's appealing to a form of hatred and disdain that some conservatives have towards women who are not reproductive or find fulfillment in other areas of life. Maybe they have an art. Maybe they have a job. Maybe they're blended into other people's families or their own. Maybe they're part of wild kinship networks that are quite sustaining and beautiful.\n\nVance is, at this moment in his rhetorical career, returning to the idea that the only possible true fulfillment for women is giving birth and motherhood. That's part of what I call in the book the fantasy of restoration \u2014 the restoration of a patriarchal order. And this is what's being called for: the restriction of freedom and the restoration of inequality inside the family.\n\nButler explains why they believe some right-wing movements globally have taken up \u201cgender ideology\u201d as a target of political ire, and why it\u2019s effectively riled up their base:\n\nIn my conversations with young people, a lot of them have said to me they don't really think there is a future. There has been a kind of despondency, if not political pessimism.\n\nWe find hypercapitalism, which is producing greater inequalities of wealth [...] deep, economic and social inequalities, which are, of course, intensified by racist forms of stratification. They add to a sense that the world is becoming less livable for the majority of people. [...]\n\nWhen authoritarians come along or populist movements come along and say, \u201cOh, you know what's making you feel so anxious? It's gender, or it's critical race theory, or it's migrants.\u201d I think many people are vulnerable to that because some of these concepts are strange to them [...]\n\nSo once that kind of discourse gets going, people can end up thinking, \u201cOh, my life is going to be restored to order, stability, harmony, my place in the world is going to be restored if we get rid of gender.\u201d\n\nButler weighs in on how they\u2019d like to see the left counter right-wing rhetoric and the campaign of Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris:\n\nWe [the left] become nerdy. We were righteous. We fight with each other [...] And it's like, well, wait a minute, what do we want to build? What passions would we like to see unleashed in the world?\n\nAnd you know, I've been taken by the joy of the Kamala Harris campaign. That in part is Black joy, and it's a tradition of joy that is deep in Black culture and that has been part of the survival of slavery \u2014 its aftermath of systemic racism, its years of segregation.\n\nSo my question for the left is \u201chow do you want to imagine the future?\u201d\n\nWhat is it that we want to see realized on this earth? Like, you could say freedom and justice and equality, but what's the tangible acoustic sense of that, right?\n\nLet us imagine freedom in a way we have not before. Make it exciting. Make it sexy.\n\nListen to the full interview here:",

        "text": "U.S. presidential election: I have a wild idea for the Harris campaign. Hear me out.\nKamala Harris is holding steady at a 3-point national lead in polling averages\u2014enough to make her the favorite to win the presidential election in November, but close enough that many observers still simply describe the race as a toss-up. (And there\u2019s disagreement about which candidate will benefit more from the Electoral College system.) Every marginal vote that Harris earns through persuasion or turnout efforts over the next month could be critical.\n\nFor this reason, the vice president should strongly consider announcing that she believes in\u2014or at the least is \u201cjust asking questions\u201d about\u2014ghosts, space aliens, and/or fantastical cryptids like Bigfoot and the West Virginia Mothman.\n\nWhy? Well, as historian John Ganz pointed out in a Tuesday post, one thing that Donald Trump\u2019s campaign has been good at is appealing to the United States\u2019 sizable community of people who hold so-called fringe beliefs. Vaccine-autism cranks, 9/11 truthers, QAnon obsessives\u2014Trump will indulge them all and has appeared on most of their podcasts. Indeed, he\u2019s secured the endorsement of America\u2019s King Crank, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., by promising to put him in charge of national health policy. (Were you tired of not having the measles?)\n\nMany such believers were drawn into active involvement in GOP politics by Trump\u2019s embrace of elaborate 2020 election conspiracy theories\u2014a kind of He\u2019s one of us recognition moment. And there are a lot of them, to the point that fringe might not be the right word for their worldview. A 2023 poll conducted by YouGov, for instance, concluded that an estimated 41 percent of Americans think it is \u201cdefinitely or probably true\u201d that \u201cregardless of who is officially in charge of the government and other organizations, there is a single group of people who secretly control events and rule the world together.\u201d This is a mass audience of voters who might not otherwise be engaged with politics were it not for Trump, which could help explain why polls underestimated him in 2016 and 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated From Slate A Presidential Race Twist That Must Infuriate Republicans Read More\n\nHarris would be well served to make a play for this audience, or at least to neutralize it as a source of support for her opponent. In a democracy, every vote counts, even the ones cast by people who think the COVID vaccine turns you into a refrigerator magnet. Recently, Harris has been engaging in what a New York Times op-ed called \u201cvice signaling,\u201d by talking about owning a gun and saying she would shoot intruders in her home\u2014i.e., conveying to voters that she isn\u2019t the scolding, uptight kind of liberal. She might benefit in a similar way from having some fringey issues of her own.\n\nAt the same time, though, they would have to be issues that don\u2019t have prior right-wing coding and are low-stakes enough not to alienate existing supporters. What about spooky stuff? Amazingly, there is a professor at the University of Delaware named Paul Brewer who studies both political communication and belief in the paranormal. That\u2019s where the terrible visage of the dreaded Mothman\u2014who is, of course, \u201ca humanoid creature reportedly seen in the Point Pleasant [West Virginia] area from November 15, 1966, to December 15, 1967\u201d\u2014comes into play. Brewer generously played ball with the premise of this piece, pointing me to research by Farleigh Dickinson University that suggests that cryptids could be fertile territory for recruiting swing voters:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDemocrats and Republicans are equally likely to believe that creatures known as Bigfoot or Sasquatch exist in the woods of the Pacific Northwest. Twenty percent of Democrats say that it\u2019s \u201csomewhat\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d likely to be true, compared with 19 percent of Republicans (and 22 percent of Americans overall). Younger Americans are much more likely than older ones to believe that it\u2019s true.\n\nIn an email, Brewer suggested that potential Harris voters might be inclined in particular to believe in the Mothman\u2014which, according to witnesses, is a 7-foot creature with glowing red eyes that makes \u201ca screeching sound\u201d as it follows cars through the dark mountain night:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn our own research and more representative surveys, a higher percentage of respondents tend to say they believe in Bigfoot than other cryptids, including the Yeti, Chupacabra, Loch Ness Monster, and, the Mothman. However, our findings do carry a hint that the Mothman in particular might appeal to potential Harris votes: we found that, controlling for other factors, liberals were more likely than conservatives to believe in the Mothman. What\u2019s going on there? One guess is that as an up-and-coming cryptid, the Mothman has a particularly strong appeal to younger and more progressive people. There\u2019s even a recent novel about a young trans boy writing letters to the Mothman.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese beliefs, Brewer\u2019s research has found, correlate with time spent watching YouTube videos; this trend suggests that they could be prevalent in the exact kind of alternative-media demographic segment that Harris needs to make inroads with.\n\nPoint Pleasant, West Virginia, also isn\u2019t that far from western Pennsylvania and the greater Pittsburgh area, home to a significant population of swing-state voters who have probably heard about this stuff. Mothman sightings have been reported as far away as Chicago, so the creature seems to get around. Come to think of it, a lot of the current swing states are places where you can make long, late drives through miles and miles of not much at all \u2026 the kinds of places where your eyes might end up playing tricks on you (or did they?).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDrawing on the political-communication side of his expertise, Brewer suggested that Harris could maximize her upside and minimize her downside by adopting a \u201cjust asking questions\u201d frame:\n\n\u201cJust asking questions\u201d could be effective for Harris (or any other politician associating themself with fringey phenomena like the Mothman) in terms of appealing to believers (who get the signal that she\u2019s \u201con their side\u201d) without needing to overtly take a fringe stand, and also from the point of view of legitimizing the phenomena: if someone authoritative says \u201cthe Mothman is real,\u201d people may tend to counterargue and resist in their minds; if the same person says, for example, \u201cI\u2019m wondering, like a lot of folks, whether the Mothman is real,\u201d or \u201cwe should take a closer look at the Mothman,\u201d or something like that, then it suggests that there\u2019s at least a controversy about the Mothman\u2019s existence. You can see the same strategy in how creationists ask for \u201cteaching the controversy\u201d about evolution, or\u2014more to the point\u2014how some high-profile politicians from both parties (like Marco Rubio and Kirsten Gillibrand, to cite two) have been talking about UFOs without ever coming right out and saying they believe in UFOs.\n\nWas a Harris\u2013Walz campaign bus really followed, in the dead of a September night on I-70, by the eerie whir of enormous wings that tracked its path for miles before disappearing suddenly in the direction of an abandoned military research facility?\n\nWould it be unethical of her to tell Joe Rogan that she thinks this may have happened?\n\nWell, how important is it to you to prevent Robert F. Kennedy Jr. from deciding who\u2019s in charge of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention?",

        "text": "Why do election polls seem to have such a mixed track record? \u2014 Harvard Gazette\nPolitical polls underestimated the support for Donald Trump and overstated the backing for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. Four years later, the polling correctly anticipated Joe Biden\u2019s win over Trump, but both national and statewide polls saw a much wider edge than he ultimately received.\n\nA task force report by the American Association of Public Opinion Research called the 2020 race the profession\u2019s biggest misfire since 1980, when polls forecast a close race and instead Ronald Reagan beat incumbent Jimmy Carter by a landslide.\n\nThe Gazette spoke with John Anzalone, Biden\u2019s chief pollster in 2020 and a Resident Fellow at the Institute of Politics this fall, about what happened in the past two elections and how the field has tried to make adjustments amid shifts in the nation\u2019s political dynamics.\n\nA co-founder of The Wall Street Journal poll, Anzalone also worked for the presidential campaigns of Hillary Clinton (2016) and Barack Obama (2008 and 2012). His firm, Impact Research, has conducted polls for Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019s campaign, but he is not involved in that work. Interview has been edited for clarity and length.\n\nPhoto by Martha Stewart\n\nWhat went wrong in the last two elections, and has the industry made any course corrections?\n\nWhat\u2019s really important is that we differentiate what professional pollsters who work for campaigns do, and what the public media polls do, because it\u2019s very, very different. You\u2019re not seeing campaign polls.\n\nI\u2019m not saying that there wasn\u2019t error. There was, especially in \u201916. But there are not many media polls that are spending a lot of money like we do to do daily interviews the right way, using multimodal methodologies, doing quotas, etc. We get branded by the fact that there are now dozens and dozens of cheap media polls that I think are a problem.\n\nIn 2016, there were a lot of legitimate concerns about polling error. What we found internally, in a group of pollsters, is that we weren\u2019t getting the right proportion of non-college-educated voters. We were getting too many service-oriented, non-college-educated voters. We weren\u2019t getting enough people who work with their hands or work in the factory or in agriculture, drivers, and things like that. We also saw that a lot of our small-town rural interviews were in the county seat, not in the rural areas. And so, we changed up a lot in terms of how we\u2019re getting our interviews and quotas with non-college-educated voters.\n\nYou have to acknowledge that Trump so changed what\u2019s going on in the political dynamics in America. And there was no way to model out who was coming out in 2016. There just wasn\u2019t. We saw a little bit of that in 2020, as well.\n\nI think the challenges have a lot to do with modeling who\u2019s going to turn out. That has been an absolute mystery in the Trump era. I couldn\u2019t tell you who\u2019s going to turn out now.\n\nWhat metrics do pollsters find best gauge who will turn out to vote?\n\nWe do an enthusiasm level, and we do a likelihood, but most of what we\u2019re doing is message development and strategy. Most of what media polls do is the big number/little number, the head-to-head, the traits, the job ratings, etc. Pollsters who are in the political space to help campaigns are message development strategists. Everything that we do goes into a TV ad or a digital ad or a speech. Yes, the head-to-head is important, and we want to get that right, but media polls have turned every pollster into a prognosticator, and that\u2019s a misread of what we do.\n\n\u201cMedia polls have turned every pollster into a prognosticator, and that\u2019s a misread of what we do.\u201d\n\nMany who were on the fence about voting when it was a Biden versus Trump matchup now say they plan to vote. How does polling capture this new, still-changing electorate?\n\nAll you can do is try to guess what percentage of your sample should be \u201cnew voters.\u201d You have the voter history of 2022, 2020, 2018, and 2016, and you have new registrants. That\u2019s not a perfect science. Who says that this cycle will be the same as past cycles, where you have to be up a certain percentage nationally to win the battleground states?\n\nThis is a tough industry on a good day. It has been a more difficult challenge during the Trump years figuring out how we can get hard-to-reach voters. Now we know there\u2019s a universe that doesn\u2019t want to take a live call or doesn\u2019t trust a live call, so we\u2019ve corrected for a lot of that. We\u2019re constantly going to have to evolve, and we\u2019re going to constantly have to correct and do better because of all of the challenges that we have.\n\nBut I\u2019m proud of our industry, and I\u2019m proud of the fact that, professionally, what we do \u2014 which you don\u2019t see \u2014 we do really well. Polling is really expensive, and most media outlets don\u2019t spend the money necessary to do it right.\n\nWhat kinds of things might both the Trump and Harris campaigns want to know from their internal polling at this point in the race?\n\nPresidential campaigns, whether you\u2019re Democrat or Republican, are going to test both positive messaging based on the strength of issues and character traits, and they\u2019re going to test all of the contrasts. There\u2019s nothing each side hasn\u2019t tested in terms of positive frames on each and negative frames on each. It\u2019s September, they\u2019ve been polling for eight months.\n\nWhat every campaign does is they dial-test their convention speeches, and they dial-test their debates. [That is, monitor responses of sample audiences to get their immediate response to words, phrases, and ideas in real time.] So, they\u2019re seeing what hits with swing voters. The convention speeches for both of them, you can guarantee they dial-tested, and that helped refine some of the things that they would say in the debate. And then, they\u2019ll dial test the debates because they\u2019ve got two months of rallies, two months of speeches, and they have TV ads, so the more data, the better. They have the foundation of their research on message, development, and contrast, and now, it\u2019s all about refinement.\n\nYou say most media polls aren\u2019t very reliable. Which are the better ones?\n\nThe Wall Street Journal is the gold standard, without a doubt, because it\u2019s multimodal. I think that Pew Research Center is the gold standard of online polls because they\u2019ve built their own online database. And then, I think the NBC poll is really good because you have a Democratic firm and a Republican firm running it, like The Wall Street Journal poll.",

The HTA describes a threat environment that is expected to \u201cremain high\u201d over the coming year.\n\n\u201cThe Homeland Security Assessment provides an important overview of the dynamic and evolving threat landscape, illustrating just how varied and challenging the threats we confront are,\u201d said Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro N. Mayorkas. \u201cIt is because of the remarkable DHS workforce, and our close collaboration with our federal, state, local, tribal, territorial, and private sector partners, that we are able to meet the challenges and keep the American people safe and secure.\u201d\n\nAssessments from the 2025 HTA:\n\nPublic Safety and Security: The terrorism threat environment in the Homeland is expected to remain high over the coming year. This is due to a confluence of factors, including potential violent extremist responses to domestic sociopolitical developments \u2014 particularly the 2024 election cycle \u2014 and international events like the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict. Lone offenders and small groups continue to pose the greatest threat. Meanwhile, foreign terrorist organizations, including ISIS and al Qa\u2019ida maintain their enduring intent to conduct or inspire attacks in the Homeland.\n\nThe terrorism threat environment in the Homeland is expected to remain high over the coming year.

Meanwhile, foreign terrorist organizations, including ISIS and al Qa\u2019ida maintain their enduring intent to conduct or inspire attacks in the Homeland. Illegal Drugs: Illegal drugs smuggled into and sold in the United States by transnational and domestic criminal actors continue to pose a lethal threat to communities in the United States. DHS has surged resources to address this threat, seized more fentanyl in the last two fiscal years than in the prior five years combined, and is investing in new technology to increase detection capabilities. Thanks to these and other efforts, the number of overdose deaths have declined by more than 10 percent in the 12 months leading up to April 2024 \u2013 the largest drop in overdose deaths in recorded history. That said, fentanyl and other synthetic opioids remain the most lethal of drugs trafficked into the country and continue to pose a national security threat. Adulterated cocaine and methamphetamine also pose a threat.\n\nIllegal drugs smuggled into and sold in the United States by transnational and domestic criminal actors continue to pose a lethal threat to communities in the United States.

Influence Operations and Transnational Repression: We expect the Homeland will face threats to public safety from state actors using subversive tactics in an effort to stroke discord and undermine confidence in U.S. domestic institutions. Malign foreign actors seek to target ethnic and religious minorities, political dissidents, and journalists in the United States to silence and harass its critics abroad.\n\nWe expect the Homeland will face threats to public safety from state actors using subversive tactics in an effort to stroke discord and undermine confidence in U.S. domestic institutions. Malign foreign actors seek to target ethnic and religious minorities, political dissidents, and journalists in the United States to silence and harass its critics abroad. Border and Immigration Security: Migrant encounters at our border have steadily declined since the beginning of 2024 and have declined even further since the issuance of the Presidential Proclamation and complementary Interim Final Rule (IFR) were announced on June 4 \u2013 decreasing more than 55% in the past four months. We nonetheless expect some individuals with criminal connections to seek to continue to exploit migrants. DHS remains acutely focused on identifying those who may present a threat to public safety or national security and stopping them from entering the United States.\n\nMigrant encounters at our border have steadily declined since the beginning of 2024 and have declined even further since the issuance of the Presidential Proclamation and complementary Interim Final Rule (IFR) were announced on June 4 \u2013 decreasing more than 55% in the past four months.

DHS remains acutely focused on identifying those who may present a threat to public safety or national security and stopping them from entering the United States. Critical Infrastructure Security: Domestic and foreign adversaries are expected to continue to target our critical infrastructure via prepositioning, cyber, and physical attacks. The People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), Russia, and Iran are expected to remain the most pressing foreign threats to our critical infrastructure. Nation-states, criminal hacktivists, and financially motivated criminals will likely hone their techniques to disrupt U.S. services or to conduct espionage focused on gaining access to U.S. networks and critical infrastructure entities. We assess that domestic and foreign violent extremists will continue to call for physical attacks on critical infrastructure in furtherance of their ideological goals and, in response to international conflicts and crises.\n\nDomestic and foreign adversaries are expected to continue to target our critical infrastructure via prepositioning, cyber, and physical attacks.

        "text": "Assessing health care challenges for next U.S. president\nOctober 2, 2024 \u2013 How can health care in the U.S. be more accessible, more affordable, and more equitable during the next presidential administration?\n\nThose were the topics addressed by a dozen experts who spoke at a Sept. 27 symposium at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health hosted by the School\u2019s Department of Health Policy and Management and the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM).\n\nEric Rubin, NEJM editor-in-chief and adjunct professor of immunology and infectious diseases at Harvard Chan School, and Jane Kim, the School\u2019s dean for academic affairs, gave opening remarks at the event, held in Snyder Auditorium.\n\nIn previous years, Rubin explained, NEJM used to commission each presidential campaign to write articles spelling out their health care policies prior to the election. \u201cIt turns out those statements got less and less interesting over time,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we thought, what if we turned to real experts instead to tell us about what we should expect and what we should hope for.\u201d\n\nIn her opening remarks, Kim listed a number of pressing issues, including the challenges of insurance coverage, the barriers still preventing millions from accessing the care they need, the rising cost of health care, and persistent health disparities.\n\nRobert Blendon spelled out the stark differences between Republicans and Democrats according to surveys he\u2019s helped conduct as director of the Harvard Opinion Research Program. \u201cLet me make this simple for you,\u201d said Blendon, Richard L. Menschel Professor of Public Health and Professor of Health Policy and Political Analysis, Emeritus at Harvard Chan School. \u201cDemocrats think we have to spend more after the election on every major problem this country is suffering, and even when we are spending enough, we need to invest more on equity. For Republicans, government spending is the reason we have such high inflation, and we have to cut back on government spending.\u201d\n\nOutside of that simple calculus, there are some nuances, he said. While mostly opposed to higher spending, Republicans do support more health care funding for veterans and for Medicare. \u201cMedicare is incredibly popular with both parties,\u201d Blendon said\u2014though Republicans are more supportive of coverage offered through Medicare Advantage (a type of Medicare plan provided by private companies), and Democrats are more supportive of imposing stricter price controls to limit costs for insurees. Also, he noted, while Democrats are supportive of abortion access in most scenarios and Republicans mostly oppose it, both parties are united in supporting in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatments.\n\nIn a panel on accessibility, Sherry Glied, dean of New York University\u2019s school of public service, started with the good news\u2014health insurance coverage has increased to record levels, with only 8% of Americans now uninsured. In addition, changes in tax credit subsidies since the American Rescue Plan and the Inflation Reduction Act have increased enrollment in state health insurance exchanges. The bad news, however, is that those subsidies are set to expire next year and will take $335 billion to renew\u2014leaving a choice for the next president and Congress that could continue to increase health care access or erode it.\n\nBen Sommers, Huntley Quelch Professor of Health Care Economics at Harvard Chan School, discussed one of the challenges regarding Medicaid\u2014the drop-off in enrollment numbers following the end of a federal policy that safeguarded coverage for millions by requiring states to maintain enrollment for most enrollees during the pandemic. State and federal policies, he said, could help people retain coverage by allowing continuous periods of eligibility, or extending the amount of time children are eligible to stay in the program even if their families\u2019 income changes. He also addressed one of the sticking points surrounding health care accessibility\u2014that 10 states, mostly in the South, have not expanded Medicaid coverage as permitted under the Affordable Care Act. Though expansion remains popular among citizens, it is often opposed by conservative governors and legislators, he said. State referenda and additional federal incentives have succeeded in expanding Medicaid in a handful of states, Sommers said, but are unlikely to prevail in many more. He noted that a recent Georgia plan to expand Medicaid in exchange for higher work requirements could be a possible way forward for other states.\n\nIn a panel addressing affordability, J. Michael McWilliams, a health care policy professor at Harvard Medical School, noted that although federal subsidies have made health care more affordable for individuals, rising spending in the health system as a whole may mean that the subsidies can\u2019t keep pace, making them less helpful. Another problem, he said, is Medicare Advantage. Those plans are aimed at reducing costs by cutting unnecessary care and better managing spending. But the plans are also costing the government and taxpayers more than traditional Medicare, and there are concerns that private insurers are pocketing earnings without trying to improve affordability. McWilliams said he thinks that stronger regulation must be put in place to ensure that Medicare Advantage plans pass any savings along to subscribers.\n\nAddressing the affordability of prescription drugs, Stacie Dusetzina, a health policy professor at Vanderbilt, outlined improvements under the Biden-Harris administration: Medicare is now able to negotiate prices for some prescription drugs, and there are caps of $35 for insulin and $2,000 for out-of-pocket prescription drug costs annually. Given Donald Trump\u2019s track record on prescription drug prices, another Trump presidency is likely to roll back recent cost-cutting efforts, she said, while a Harris presidency would likely expand them. Dusetzina warned, however, about potential unintended consequences of Harris\u2019s stated plan to extend existing price caps to private insurance plans. \u201cThat\u2019s not necessarily going to help people the way you think it should,\u201d she said. \u201cYou end up shielding consumers from price, but they are still paying for it through higher premiums or low wage growth.\u201d\n\nIn a panel on health equity, Ohio State University health law professor Ruqaiijah Yearby pointed to the importance of examining how structural determinants of health create health inequities, including structural racism embedded in federal policies. That effort, however, could be complicated by the recent Supreme Court ruling in the Chevron case, which shifts more power to judges to overrule decisions by federal agencies. \u201cWe need to pay attention to who we elect, because they are going to decide what judges we appoint,\u201d Yearby said.\n\nHarvard Chan School\u2019s Marcella Alsan, professor in the Department of Health Policy and Management, spoke about the role of interest groups in shaping public policy. She pointed out that one of the biggest players in shaping our current system of private health insurance after World War II was the American Medical Association (AMA), leading to many of the problems we see today with access, affordability, and equity. No matter who is elected to the presidency or to Congress, she said, it\u2019s important to be vigilant about these often unseen players who can influence health policy. After all, she noted, four of the top 10 federal lobbyists by spending come from the health care industry [Blue Cross Blue Shield, the AMA, the American Hospital Association, and the pharmaceutical industry]. It\u2019s crucial, she said, to pay attention to who the special interests are and who they\u2019re beholden to.\n\n\u2013 Michael Blanding\n\nPhotos: Kent Dayton",

        "text": "Zhou Explores Differences Between Harris and Trump on China\n2 October 2024 \u2022 Research\n\nHow the U.S.\u2019 policy toward China may change following the presidential election.\n\nIn two new essays in the U.S.-China Perception Monitor, Associate Professor of Asian Studies Jinghao Zhou discusses the potential foreign policy differences between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, and how those difference might impact the United States\u2019 relationship with China after the U.S. presidential election.\n\nIn \u201cStrategic Calculations: China\u2019s Dilemma Between Trump and Harris,\u201d Zhou argues that Harris is unlikely to formulate a brand-new foreign policy toward China in the near term, and that her economic plan is largely an extension of President Joe Biden\u2019s existing policies. If elected, Zhou says, she would likely follow the Biden-Obama foreign policy, which would make her approach more predictable for China.\n\nOn the other hand, Zhou says, China understands that Trump\u2019s unpredictability and aggressive tactics could escalate tensions. If Trump were to return to the White House, China would need to adapt to his second-term policy to manage its relations with the U.S. Zhou\u2019s article predicts that in preparation for this possibility, China will analyze the principles, priorities and strategy of Trump\u2019s foreign policy and its implications for U.S.-China relations.\n\nRead Zhou\u2019s article here.\n\nZhou further explores the potential implications of a Harris administration on U.S.-China relations in \u201cHow Might China Recalibrate Its Policy Toward the U.S. if Harris is Elected.\u201d In the piece, Zhou says that if elected, Harris \u201cis likely to emphasize a nuanced balance of engagement and competition rather than outright confrontation,\u201d but that China should not expect Harris to make the first move in altering the United States\u2019 focus on competing with China. China may even face a more pragmatic yet firm U.S. stance. \u201cChina will need to reassess its strategies, engaging in more strategic negotiations while balancing its assertive nationalism with economic resilience due to her anticipated shift in approach,\u201d says Zhou.\n\nRead the article here.\n\nZhou earned his Ph.D. from Baylor University, M.Div. from Union Theological Seminary, M.A. from Wuhan University and B.A. from Nanjing University. He has taught courses in Asian Studies including \u201cChina-the U.S.,\u201d \u201cChinese Women,\u201d \u201cContemporary China\u201d and \u201cChinese Cinema.\u201d His research focuses on Chinese ideology, politics, religion and U.S.-China relations. He has published dozens of journal articles and six books. His latest book is Great Power Competition as the New Normal of China-U.S. Relations (2023).",

        "text": "In a largely uneventful and inconsequential US vice presidential debate, no one can claim victory\nJust like vice presidents themselves, in US politics, debates don\u2019t really matter until they do. The most recent debate (and likely the last of the 2024 election cycle) between aspiring vice presidents Senator JD Vance and Governor Tim Walz isn\u2019t likely to matter much at all.\n\nHosted by CBS, the vice presidential debate took place under much the same rules as the first and only debate between presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. There was no audience and very little fact-checking. The only real difference was that the microphones weren\u2019t muted when a candidate wasn\u2019t speaking \u2013 a setup that only really got away from the two moderators once.\n\nA shallow, optics-focused analysis would suggest that the format favoured Vance; that he successfully projected an image of himself as a sensible, commonsense candidate. But Walz also performed entirely adequately, reinforcing his steady, nice-guy image.\n\nThere was, in the end, no clear winner. But there was a lot of substance.\n\nAmerica, and a world, in crisis\n\nCBS moderators opened the debate by noting the many intersecting crises facing the US and the rest of the world. Specifically listing the dangerously escalating situation in the Middle East, Hurricane Helene and a labour strike, the moderators focused first on Iran.\n\nIn a bizarre choice, rather than asking how each candidate would aim to deescalate or even build peace in the region, the candidates were asked whether or not they would support an Israeli \u201cpreemptive strike\u201d on Iran.\n\nWalz, perhaps caught off guard by the specificity of the question, got off to a shaky start, but recovered well enough. Vance, on steadier ground, outlined his ticket\u2019s firm support for Israel.\n\nThat neither candidate took issue with the casual suggestion of a \u201cpreemptive strike\u201d says a great deal about US global leadership today.\n\nUnlike in the previous presidential debate, the unfolding crisis caused by Hurricane Helene elevated the issue of climate change to the second question. While both candidates touted policies of strengthening fossil fuel production and use at home, Vance\u2019s answer hinted at the underlying radicalism of his politics.\n\nNoting the tragic loss of life in states such as North Carolina, Vance was careful to distinguish victims of the hurricane as \u201cinnocent\u201d. He promised, quite specifically, that a future Trump administration would support \u201ccitizens\u201d affected by climate change fuelled disasters such as Helene.\n\nThese coded references to race and immigration were carefully designed to reinforce Trump and Vance\u2019s conspiratorial narratives about an America under siege, facing an \u201cinvasion\u201d of \u201cillegal aliens\u201d.\n\nVance is accomplished at sanitising Trump\u2019s rhetoric, and made a considerable effort to project a sense of reasonableness. Walz\u2019s weakness \u2013 along with the broader Democratic policy platform \u2013 is that he attempts to walk a line between conceding to the right on issues of immigration while simultaneously attempting not to alienate the diverse base of support for the Democratic party. It remains to be seen if anyone will be convinced.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Walz was stronger on issues that favour the Democrats, including health care and reproductive rights. Vance was careful not to be drawn on the question of a national abortion ban, a policy favoured by much of Trump\u2019s conservative support base. He spoke instead of his support for a \u201cminimum national standard\u201d (in effect, if not in language, the same thing).\n\nThe standout moment came towards the end. Just as in that very first debate between President Joe Biden and Trump a political lifetime ago, the moderators did not ask about the integrity of US democracy until quite a long way into the 90-minute run time.\n\nAsked by his opponent about Trump\u2019s refusal to concede the 2020 election, Vance refused to engage, saying he was instead \u201cfocused on the future\u201d. That future, as Walz noted, involves entirely credible threats to US democracy continuing to come from Vance\u2019s running mate.\n\nQuiet conspiracy\n\nUnlike that running mate, Vance largely steered away from spouting conspiracy theories about stolen elections \u2013 or any of the far-right\u2019s other favoured issues \u2013 directly. In his final statement, though, he highlighted what allows them to thrive.\n\nApparently attempting to moderate Trump\u2019s nightmarish rhetoric of \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d, Vance leaned into a familiar exceptionalism, focusing at the end on the beauty and the wonder of America. He is proud, he said, to live \u201cin the most incredible country in the world. But\u2026\u201d\n\nIt is in the space after that \u201cbut\u201d that conspiracy thrives. If the US is indeed the best country in the world, how can there be a \u201cbut\u201d? If it cannot be that the US might not be the best country in the world, then the answer can only be that its success is being undermined by a conspiracy against it.\n\nIn New York tonight, Walz did not do enough to fill that space. Vance sought to quietly expand it.\n\nThat neither of them conclusively succeeded likely won\u2019t matter to the final outcome. Still, the space after the \u201cbut\u2026\u201d hangs over us all.",

        "text": "Read Jack Smith\u2019s unsealed court filing that says Trump \u2018resorted to crimes\u2019 after 2020 election\nDonald Trump laid the groundwork to try to overturn the 2020 election even before he lost, knowingly pushed false claims of voter fraud and \u201cresorted to crimes\u201d in his failed bid to cling to power, according to a newly unsealed court filing from prosecutors that offers new evidence from the landmark criminal case against the former president.\n\nRead the full filing here.\n\nThe filing from special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s team offers the most comprehensive view to date of what prosecutors intend to prove if the case charging Trump with conspiring to overturn the election reaches trial.\n\nThough a months-long congressional investigation and the indictment itself have chronicled in stark detail Trump\u2019s efforts to undo the election, the filing cites previously unknown accounts offered by Trump\u2019s closest aides to paint a portrait of an \u201cincreasingly desperate\u201d president who while losing his grip on the White House \u201cused deceit to target every stage of the electoral process.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what?\u201d the filing quotes Trump as telling an aide after being advised that his vice president, Mike Pence, had been rushed to a secure location after a crowd of violent Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 to try to prevent the counting of electoral votes.\n\nWATCH: What newly unsealed evidence reveals about Trump\u2019s alleged actions on and before Jan. 6\n\n\u201cThe details don\u2019t matter,\u201d Trump said, when told by an adviser that a lawyer who was mounting his legal challenges wouldn\u2019t be able to prove the false allegations in court, the filing states.\n\nThe brief was made public over the Trump legal team\u2019s objections in the final month of a closely contested presidential race in which Democrats have sought to make Trump\u2019s refusal to accept the election results four years ago central to their claims that he is unfit for office.\n\nThe issue surfaced as recently as Tuesday night\u2019s vice presidential debate when Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, lamented the violence at the Capitol while a Republican opponent, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, refused to directly answer when asked whether Trump had lost the 2020 race.\n\nThe filing was submitted, initially under seal, following a Supreme Court opinion that conferred broad immunity on former presidents for official acts they take in office, a decision that narrowed the scope of the prosecution and eliminated the possibility of a trial before next month\u2019s election.\n\nThe purpose of the brief is to persuade U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan that the offenses charged in the indictment were undertaken in Trump\u2019s private, rather than presidential capacity, and can therefore remain part of the case as it moves forward. Chutkan permitted a redacted version to be made public even though Trump\u2019s lawyers argued that it was unfair to unseal it so close to the election.\n\nThough the prospects of a trial are uncertain, particularly in the event that Trump wins the presidency and a new attorney general seeks the dismissal of the case, the brief nonetheless functions as a roadmap for the testimony and evidence prosecutors would elicit before a jury.\n\n\u201cAlthough the defendant was the incumbent President during the charged conspiracies, his scheme was fundamentally a private one,\u201d Smith\u2019s team wrote, adding, \u201cWhen the defendant lost the 2020 presidential election, he resorted to crimes to try to stay in office.\u201d\n\nTrump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung called the brief \u201cfalsehood-ridden\u201d and \u201cunconstitutional\u201d and repeated oft-stated allegations that Smith and Democrats were \u201chell-bent on weaponizing the Justice Department in an attempt to cling to power.\u201d Trump, in a separate post on his Truth Social platform, said the case would end with his \u201ccomplete victory.\u201d\n\nThe filing alleges that Trump \u201claid the groundwork\u201d for rejecting the election results before the contest was over, telling advisers that in the event he held an early lead he would \u201cdeclare victory before the ballots were counted and any winner was projected.\u201d\n\nImmediately after the election, prosecutors say, his advisers sought to sow chaos in the counting of votes. In one instance, a campaign employee, who is also described as a Trump co-conspirator, was told that results favoring Democrat Joe Biden at a Michigan polling center appeared accurate. The person is alleged to have replied: \u201cfind a reason it isnt\u201d and \u201cgive me options to file litigation.\u201d\n\nProsecutors also alleged that Trump advanced claims of fraud despite knowing they were false, describing how he told others that allegations of election regularity made by attorney Sidney Powell were \u201ccrazy\u201d and referenced the science fiction series \u201cStar Trek.\u201d Even so, days later, he promoted on the platform then known as Twitter a lawsuit she was about to file.\n\nIn demonstrating his apparent indifference to the accuracy of the election fraud claims, prosecutors also cite an account of a White House staffer who after the election overheard Trump telling his wife, daughter and son-in-law on Marine One: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you won or lost the election. You still have to fight like hell.\u201d\n\nThe filing also includes details of conversations between Trump and Pence, including a private lunch the two had on Nov. 12, 2020, in which Pence \u201creiterated a face-saving option\u201d for Trump, telling him, \u201cDon\u2019t concede but recognize the process is over.\u201d\n\nIn another private lunch days later, Pence urged Trump to accept the results of the election and run again in 2024.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, 2024 is so far off,\u201d Trump told him, the filing states.\n\nProsecutors say that by Dec. 5, the defendant was starting to think about Congress\u2019 role in the process.\n\n\u201cFor the first time, he mentioned to Pence the possibility of challenging the election results in the House of Representatives,\u201d it says, citing a phone call.\n\nBut Trump \u201cdisregarded\u201d Pence \u201cin the same way he disregarded dozens of court decisions that unanimously rejected his and his allies\u2019 legal claims, and that he disregarded officials in the targeted states \u2014 including those in his own party \u2014 who stated publicly that he had lost and that his specific fraud allegations were false,\u201d prosecutors wrote.\n\nPence chronicled some of his interactions with Trump, and his eventual split with him, in a 2022 book he wrote called \u201cSo Help Me God.\u201d He also was ordered to appear before the grand jury investigating Trump after courts rejected claims of executive privilege.\n\nProsecutors also argue Trump used his Twitter account to further his illegal scheme by spreading false claims of election fraud, attacking \u201cthose speaking the truth\u201d about his election loss and exhorting his supporters to travel to Washington for the Jan. 6, 2021, certification.\n\nThey intend to use \u201cforensic evidence\u201d from Trump\u2019s iPhone to provide insight into Trump\u2019s actions after the attack at the Capitol.\n\nOf the more than 1,200 Tweets Trump sent during the weeks detailed in the indictment, prosecutors say, the vast majority were about the 2020 election, including those falsely claiming Pence could reject electors even though the vice president had told Trump that he had no such power.\n\nThat \u201csteady stream of disinformation\u201d in the weeks after the election culminated in his speech at the Ellipse on the morning of Jan. 6, 2021, in which Trump \u201cused these lies to inflame and motivate the large and angry crowd of his supporters to march to the Capitol and disrupt the certification proceeding,\u201d prosecutors wrote.\n\nHis \u201cpersonal desperation was at its zenith\u201d that morning as he was \u201conly hours from the certification proceeding that spelled the end,\u201d prosecutors wrote.\n\n\u2014 Eric Tucker and Alanna Durkin Richer, Associated Press\n\nAssociated Press writers Jill Colvin and Lisa Mascaro contributed to this report.",

        "text": "Is It OK to Leave the U.S. if the Wrong Candidate Becomes President?\nA few years ago, American friends of mine bought a home in a European country in order to obtain an E.U. passport. (The country has an immigration program supporting this.) They state that they are doing so in case the United States presidential election goes as they fear.\n\nThey, and I, have no doubt that the U.S. would fall to some form of authoritarianism if the wrong candidate were elected. They, and I, are white, well educated, nonimmigrants and upper middle class, with a wide range of well-connected and financially stable friends. Our demographic backgrounds are relevant to my question, which is on the ethics of leaving a country because its democratic institutions are failing.\n\nAs members of some of the groups who most likely will retain many tangible privileges and are least likely to be negatively affected, do we have an ethical obligation to stay and help those who will be impacted more harshly than us, or is it ethically acceptable to leave the country? \u2014 Name Withheld\n\nFrom the Ethicist:\n\nTo say \u2018\u2018my country, right or wrong,\u2019\u2019 G.K. Chesterton complained, was like saying \u2018\u2018my mother, drunk or sober.\u2019\u2019 If your mother took to drink (or, in another example of his, if your son committed murder), a loving relationship meant that you couldn\u2019t be blithely indifferent. I take his point about alcoholic parents and murderous offspring. By my lights, though, when genuine patriots say \u2018\u2018my country, right or wrong,\u2019\u2019 they mean that it\u2019s their country whether or not they agree with what is done in its name. That\u2019s the opposite of giving the country a free pass. It expresses a commitment to trying to help your country do what it should \u2014 which is how we should normally feel about our families too.",

Their opposing views on climate action, pandemic preparedness, and infectious disease prevention, among other challenges, will significantly influence the trajectory of millions of lives around the world .",
        "text": "The Presidential Election Will Shape the Future of Human Health\nAs diplomats and officials from around the world gathered in New York last week for the annual United Nations General Assembly, one question dominated the attention of global leaders: who will lead the U.S. in 2025? The stakes of this election go far beyond America\u2019s borders. The next president will play a critical role in addressing the world\u2019s most pressing challenges: climate change, global health, and international cooperation. And the choice between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump could not be clearer.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump offer two starkly different visions of how the U.S. should engage on global challenges ranging from economic inequality to global health. Their opposing views on climate action, pandemic preparedness, and infectious disease prevention, among other challenges, will significantly influence not just the daily lives of Americans but the trajectory of millions of lives around the world.\n\nGlobal cooperation vs. a retreat from global responsibility\n\nVice President Harris has consistently demonstrated her commitment to addressing the world's most pressing challenges through multilateralism and global cooperation. Her approach embraces the notion that U.S. leadership is indispensable to tackling global issues. She recognizes that challenges like the spread of epidemics and pandemics and the emergence of bugs resistant to antimicrobial medicines are not isolated to individual nations\u2014they are inherently global, demanding collective action.\n\nIn stark contrast, isolationism, skepticism toward international organizations, and a retreat from global responsibility characterized former President Trump\u2019s approach during his administration. In 2018, he disbanded a pandemic unit that President Obama had established that was tasked with preparing for the next pandemic. He recently told TIME that if re-elected, he will disband the Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy, which the Biden Administration created. Trump\u2019s foreign policy when in office often undermined global cooperation when it was most needed, notably pulling the U.S. out of the Paris Climate Agreement and initiating the U.S.\u2019s withdrawal from the World Health Organization (WHO) in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, a once-in-a-century global health crisis. (Biden\u2019s administration later reversed course on both withdrawals.) Trump\u2019s congressional ally Rep Marjorie Taylor Greene says that if Trump wins a second term in office next year, it is \u201cvery likely\u201d that he would withdraw the U.S from the WHO again.\n\nRead More: The Global System for Distributing Mpox Shots Is Broken. Here\u2019s How to Fix It\n\nIt is hard to think of an action more destructive to public health at home and abroad than the U.S. severing ties with the WHO. There is no other organization that has the same legitimacy, the same power to convene the world\u2019s health experts, and the same global reach. U.S. health agencies like the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes for Health work closely with the WHO on a wide range of health challenges, including cancer prevention and polio eradication\u2014work that would be greatly harmed if Trump were to pull the U.S. out of the WHO.\n\nIf Trump is elected again, we can expect less engagement with global health institutions and more emphasis on going it alone: a strategy that leaves America and the world more vulnerable to future health crises. The COVID-19 pandemic taught us that we live in an interconnected world\u2014no country can face pandemics alone. An outbreak anywhere can become an outbreak everywhere unless countries work together. In contrast to Trump, Harris supports strengthening global institutions like the WHO and fostering partnerships to improve global health security, recognizing that infectious diseases know no borders.\n\nA critical moment for climate leadership\n\nThe recent devastation caused by Hurricane Helene highlights the urgency of addressing climate change, as increasingly severe weather patterns threaten communities, infrastructure, and livelihoods. Harris has championed the need for swift action to curb greenhouse gas emissions, transition to renewable energy, and support vulnerable nations in their adaptation efforts. These priorities are more than just environmental stewardship; they represent an investment in the health, security, and economic stability of our children. She also sees robust climate action not only as a way to protect the planet but also as an economic opportunity for American workers. Clean energy could be the next great job creator, with millions of green jobs emerging as we invest in wind, solar, and other renewable technologies.\n\nRead More: Products Can Harm People for Decades Before Companies Change. Here\u2019s How to Stop Them\n\nIn contrast, Trump has repeatedly downplayed the urgency of climate change and promoted fossil fuels over clean energy. He has repeatedly questioned the scientific consensus on climate change, rolled back environmental regulations, and promoted fossil fuel development. These policies, if reinstated, would not only exacerbate the climate crisis but also alienate the U.S. from key international partners who are pushing forward on climate action. A second Trump term would likely see more environmental rollbacks and less global cooperation on one of the most critical issues of our time.\n\nReaching global development goals\n\nThe differences between Harris and Trump are also evident when it comes to broader global development goals. The Sustainable Development Goals are a set of global targets agreed upon by 193 U.N. member states, including the U.S, with a target date of 2030. They aim to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure prosperity for all. The U.S. is the largest financier of this agenda, and its leadership is crucial. Harris has made it clear that she will keep the U.S. engaged in this effort, understanding that global development directly affects our national security and economic prosperity. Trump\u2019s past actions, however, show a clear disregard for these international commitments, and a second term would likely see further disengagement from global development efforts.\n\nRead More: The Far Right and Far Left Meet Over Wellness Conspiracy Theories\n\nFor middle-class families in America, these conversations are not just about abstract foreign policy. They are about the jobs that can come from leading the world in clean energy. They are about staying safe from global health threats by working with other nations to prepare for and respond to pandemics. And they are about ensuring a stable global economy that benefits American workers and businesses.\n\nAll told, Harris\u2019s vision of global cooperation aligns with the urgency of transnational threats. She understands that if the U.S. retreats from its commitments, it will not just be the millions of American middle-class families who will suffer: global health security will be weakened, the risk of pandemics will increase, and climate disasters will worsen.\n\nDiplomats and officials from around the world are nervously watching the U.S. presidential election, as they know that the stakes are high. In the next five years, the decisions made in the White House will determine the fate of our collective human health. The next U.S. president will not just be making decisions for America\u2014they\u2019ll be setting the tone for the world. Will we work together with our allies and international partners, or will we step back and let others lead? The consequences of that choice will reverberate far beyond our borders.",

Same-day, in-person voting is not available outside the United States. Many states require voted ballots to reach local election officials by the time polls close on election day (Tuesday, November 5). U.S. citizens who want to participate in the 2024 U.S. elections from overseas should have already returned their absentee ballots to their local election officials.\n\nNever received your ballot?\n\nIf you registered to vote and requested an absentee ballot prior to your state\u2019s registration deadline, but have not yet received your ballot, you can complete and return a Federal Write-in Absentee Ballot (FWAB) and return it to your local election office. The FWAB is available at www.FVAP.gov. If your regular ballot arrives later, complete and return it as well. Your FWAB will only be counted if your regular ballot does not reach local election officials by your state\u2019s deadline. Your vote will not be counted twice.\n\nRETURNING YOUR BALLOT:\n\nIf you plan to drop your ballot off at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo to be returned to your local election office, we recommend you do so no later than October 4. Please ensure your ballot is addressed to your local election officials and is either placed a postage-paid envelope or bears sufficient domestic U.S. postage. The U.S. Embassy in Cairo at 5 Tawfik Diab St., Garden City, accepts completed voting materials, including sealed ballots, for forwarding to your local election office in the United States. Drop off your ballots at the Consular Entrance Gate from Sunday to Thursday, 12:00 PM to 3:00 PM. The drop box will not be available when the U.S. Embassy is closed for holidays. You do not need an appointment to drop off your ballot. Ballots must be addressed to local election offices and placed in postage paid return envelopes or in envelopes bearing sufficient U.S. domestic postage so they may be delivered to the proper local election authorities. Printable postage-paid envelope templates are available on FVAP\u2019s website. The U.S. Embassy does not sell U.S. postage stamps. Postage from Egypt to the United States is not required using this method.\n\nMail from the U.S. Embassy can take up to four weeks to reach its destination in the United States. The 2024 general elections date is November 5, please plan accordingly. U.S. citizens may also send the ballot to the United States without Embassy assistance via international courier services such as DHL and FedEx.\n\nMissed the U.S. Embassy shipment deadline?\n\nIf your state allows, you may be able to return your voted ballot to your local election office electronically. You can also consider returning your ballot via an express courier service at your own expense. Ballots sent via express courier do not receive standard postmarks, so voters using this method should confirm delivery on or before November 5 prior to payment and shipment. Check your state\u2019s voting procedures at www.FVAP.gov for guidance.\n\nIf you have previously registered to vote and requested an absentee ballot but it has not yet arrived, some states allow voters to email or fax their voted, signed Federal Write-in Absentee Ballots to local election officials. Review your state\u2019s voting procedures at www.FVAP.gov carefully for guidance.\n\nHELP SPREAD THE WORD ABOUT OVERSEAS VOTING.\n\nPlease help spread the word to your friends, family, and colleagues that now is the time return your ballot if you are voting from overseas.\n\nHave Questions?\n\nPlease contact Cairo\u2019s Voting Assistance Officer at votecairo@state.gov You can also contact the Federal Voting Assistance Program directly at Vote@FVAP.gov.\n\nConfirm your registration and ballot delivery online.

        "summary": " In the U.S. Congress, women's rights to have access to abortion are under threat . Women's rights have been under threat since Roe v. Wade was overturned in 1973 . Women\u2019s right to have an abortion in the United States is under attack .",
        "text": "Harris vs. Trump: Stance on Abortion, IVF, Reproductive Care Explained\n\u201cWe saw under the previous Trump administration unprecedented attacks on the abortion care landscape nationwide and the federal family planning program, which provides essential care to low-income people across the country, as well as attacks on the broader healthcare system. We\u2019re extremely concerned about the prospect of a second Trump administration as well as control of Congress,\u201d Cappello told Healthline.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump and JD Vance and their allies are extremely dangerous for our reproductive freedom,\u201d said Olivia Cappello, associate director for state advocacy communications at Planned Parenthood Votes .\n\nContinued access to contraceptive care, including birth control , comprehensive sex education, and family planning services, also rests in the hands of voters this election.\n\nThe rights to other reproductive freedoms, such as access to in vitro fertilization (IVF) , are also on the ballot, with some religious groups condemning the procedure and conservative state courts challenging the concept of personhood.\n\nTrump has neither confirmed nor denied whether he would sign a nationwide abortion ban if elected to office.\n\nHarris and running mate Tim Walz remain committed to protecting reproductive rights. Meanwhile, Trump has changed his position on abortion several times throughout his presidential campaign and over 25 years as a public figure.\n\nConstitutional amendment measures in 10 key states could restore abortion rights that have been restricted since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.\n\nOn November 5, abortion access and reproductive rights will be top of mind for millions of voters as they head to the polls to determine the next president of the United States.\n\nInfant mortality rates have risen since Roe was overturned.\n\nNew research published in JAMA Pediatrics shows infant mortality rates have increased by 7%, while babies born with genetic and chromosomal disorders have increased by as much as 10%.\n\nA recent Pew Research poll shows 63% of U.S. adults believe that abortion should be legal in all or most cases. Despite this, millions of people have been unable to access safe and legal abortion in the 2 years since the landmark Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade.\n\nAccording to Guttmacher Institute data:\n\n14 states have total abortion bans with very limited exceptions\n\n27 states have abortion bans based on gestation, 8 states ban abortion at or before 18 weeks, and 19 states ban abortion after 18 weeks\n\nMost abortions occur during the first trimester, while abortions later in pregnancy are less common. According to recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) , 93.5% of abortions occur within or at the end of the first trimester, and only 0.9% of abortions occur at 21 weeks or later.\n\nPost-Dobbs, a national survey shows 1 in 5 OB-GYNs feel constraints on miscarriage management and pregnancy-related emergencies. In addition, a much larger percentage of OB-GYNs (70%) believe that racial and ethnic inequities in maternal health have increased as a result of the Dobbs decision.\n\nA growing body of evidence sheds light on the negative reproductive health outcomes tied to abortion bans and restrictions. In 2023, the Guttmacher Institute estimated that 171,000 people traveled to another state to obtain abortion care.\n\nIn Alabama, the state\u2019s attorney general has threatened to prosecute people for crossing state lines to obtain an abortion.\n\nIn Georgia, where a six-week abortion ban was recently reinstated, one woman died after being denied lifesaving emergency care to treat an abortion pill-related infection and complication. Just months before her death, the state had made it illegal and a felony to perform this routine procedure to clear fetal tissues.\n\nIn Florida, where there is a 6-week abortion ban, a woman was forced to carry a baby to term who was born without kidneys and would later die in her arms.\n\nIn Texas, at least three women have died after doctors delayed emergency care during pregnancy complications. One woman was told by a medical team she could not receive miscarriage care until after the fetal heartbeat stopped.\n\nIn some states, there are exceptions to abortion bans, such as rape or incest, but access to abortion care in these places remains an obstacle, particularly for people of color, people with low incomes, and people living in rural areas or maternal care deserts.\n\n\u201cAbortion has always been essential reproductive healthcare for so many people. In the post-Dobbs era, it\u2019s become very apparent to people across the country how critical that care is, regardless of where in pregnancy a person is or their life circumstances,\u201d Cappello said.\n\n\u201cWhen people are denied abortion care, they are more likely to struggle financially, more likely to have healthcare complications later, and for their children to have a tougher time as well, both in their development and in their future education, continuing the cycle of poverty and strife for families.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u2014 Olivia Cappello, Planned Parenthood Votes\n\nA national abortion ban remains at the forefront of the anti-abortion movement, whether through legislation or enforcing a 19th-century anti-obscenity law known as the Comstock Act.\n\nUnder a second Trump administration, a looming political initiative known as Project 2025 could threaten reproductive freedom for all.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s stance on abortion\n\nTrump has neither confirmed nor denied he would sign an abortion ban if passed by Congress. He dodged questions about it during the presidential debate.\n\nTrump has repeatedly denied involvement with Project 2025 despite some of his former advisers being heavily involved with the conservative roadmap for the next administration. A nationwide abortion ban is central to this right-wing agenda.\n\nTrump and running mate JD Vance argue that access to abortion should be left to each state.\n\nWhile Trump has shifted his abortion stance throughout his campaign, Vance openly opposes abortion and has said it should be \u201cillegal\u201d in all 50 states.\n\nTrump has said his administration \u201cwill be great for women and their reproductive rights\u201d in a post on his social media platform Truth Social.\n\nTrump also said that he supports exceptions to abortion bans in cases of rape, incest, and when the \u201clife of the mother is at risk.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur biggest concern is that we know that if we have a second Trump presidency, we will see an abortion ban nationwide, and I cannot begin to convey how dangerous that would be,\u201d Amy Williams Navarro, director of government relations at Reproductive Freedom for All, told Healthline.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re already seeing over 20 states with severe restrictions or complete bans on abortion and the consequences of those bans \u2014 and we would see that exacerbated across the country, with people in all 50 states unable to access critical abortion care.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u2014 Amy Williams Navarro, Reproductive Freedom for All\n\nKamala Harris\u2019s stance on abortion\n\nHarris has made abortion access and reproductive rights a focus throughout her campaign. She has referred to states where abortion access is restricted as \u201cTrump abortion bans.\u201d\n\nIn her keynote speech at the Democratic National Convention, Harris said she would sign a bill into law that would restore reproductive freedom.\n\nHarris\u2019s campaign website states that as president, she will never allow a national abortion ban to become law.\n\n\u201cKamala Harris has shown she is a steadfast champion for reproductive freedom, not only in the executive actions she has supported through the Biden administration to protect and secure access to reproductive healthcare, but also in the ways that she speaks about abortion access, and the importance of fertility care and comprehensive healthcare,\u201d Cappello said.",

        "text": "International news is on the line in the upcoming presidential election\nSo much is on the line in the U.S. presidential election, including the future of international philanthropic giving \u2014 and the international news it funds.\n\nPolitics aside, a second Donald Trump victory would undoubtedly ensure that more donated dollars from individuals and foundations will go to domestic causes, rather than abroad. Conventional wisdom suggests that elections heighten overall donor engagement, but that\u2019s not true for international causes.\n\nAt Global Press, the international news organization that I founded in 2006, U.S. presidential cycles are nothing new. This will be our fifth. Unfortunately, we know from experience that there is always a downturn in international giving during election season, and the future of that giving will depend largely on who ends up in the White House.\n\nOf course, the current investment trend in local news in the U.S. is necessary and deeply important. But this is also a critical moment for international news, which receives just a fraction of journalism philanthropy. We need credible, locally-driven reporting from the world\u2019s most challenging places \u2014 reporting that connects not only U.S. policy with the rest of the world, but also reveals simmering, often unnoticed global trends. This need is more acute than ever, many governments shift toward authoritarianism and press freedom is under increasing threat.\n\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve spent the last seven months expanding our operating model. For nearly two decades, we\u2019ve trained and employed women journalists to cover their own communities. While this community-focused model yielded powerful, long-term reporting of some of the world\u2019s most complex locations, it often left our work on the fringes of news cycles.\n\nNow, like the world around us, we\u2019re changing. We\u2019re going to focus our coverage and training programs on three of the most pressing issues of our time \u2014 civil liberties, global health and environment. Our journalists will still report from the places where they\u2019re from, but their work will emphasize the increasing interconnectedness of our world.\n\nWe\u2019ve created new career pathways for local women journalists too. In October, we\u2019ll begin recruiting for a new, two-year topical reporting fellowship focused on shifting democracies. This fellowship will invite women from countries including Ukraine, Nigeria, Kazakhstan, and Brazil to work together to tell interconnected stories about the rise of authoritarianism. More topical reporting fellowships in the global health and environment verticals will follow, supplemented by our reporter-in-residence roles and a growing reporting network of women who complete our new certificate programs while working in other newsrooms.\n\nWe\u2019ve redefined what makes a Global Press story. We\u2019ll move toward investigative and explanatory journalism, while ensuring that our stories continue to be distinguished by hyper-local sourcing, accuracy and the revelatory nature of the coverage. This blend of global context and nuanced local analysis will ensure that we engage our target audiences, the local and international educators, policy makers and movement builders who need our stories most.\n\nBut change is hard \u2014 especially when we\u2019re facing the possibility of significant cuts from our philanthropic base after the election. Giving has already been slow this year. At Global Press, we\u2019ve laid off four full-time staff members and had to downsize the number of contract editors and reporters we work with. And we\u2019re not alone. In 2023, there were 8,000 job cuts in the journalism industry, including from within the nonprofit news space. In 2024, big cuts have continued at National Geographic, CNN, The Wall Street Journal, The LA Times and many others. Across the world, newsrooms are struggling too. Our new operating model blends earned and philanthropic revenue streams, so we\u2019re hopeful that layoffs aren\u2019t a consistent threat for us in the future. Meanwhile, our news will remain free for the dozens of local and international news organizations that rely on it.\n\nPhilanthropic giving priorities may shift with either a Harris or a Trump administration. And while the chaos happening in the U.S. continues to dominate the news cycle, we have to remember that the U.S. doesn\u2019t exist in a vacuum. The opportunity to better understand the world and our place in it is something we need talented local journalists, from a wide range of countries, to do.\n\nDespite the uncertainty of where dollars will flow next, Global Press isn\u2019t simply hoping to be shielded from budget hits. We know that in today\u2019s news market, if you aren\u2019t innovating, you\u2019re dying. The opportunity to boost both efficiency and reader engagement was a welcome challenge. We know we\u2019re making the bold changes necessary to give people the information they need to navigate our changing world.",

        "text": "U.S. Presidential Election 2024: A courteous debate between running mates brings relief\nIt was a debate Americans hadn\u2019t seen in a while. On the evening of October 1, Democrat Tim Walz and Republican J.D. Vance engaged in a thoughtful and cordial exchange, focused on the proposals of their respective running mates, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, rather than personal attacks. This was a far cry from the Republican billionaire's signature style.\n\nFor an hour and a half, the two men, Walz, the governor of Minnesota, and Vance, the senator from Ohio, covered key issues of concern to Americans: inflation, immigration, abortion, healthcare, and gun control. Despite their microphones being open the entire time, they resisted the urge to interrupt each other.\n\nOn many issues, the candidates even showed agreement. When Walz mentioned that his son had witnessed a shooting, his opponent offered his sympathy. \u201cI'm sorry about that,\u201d the Republican said. \u201cChrist, have mercy.\u201d\n\nMission accomplished\n\nTraditionally, debates between potential vice presidents receive less attention than those between presidential candidates. The main goal of such encounters is to avoid missteps that could harm their running mate, as was the case in 2008 when Sarah Palin, John McCain\u2019s number two pick, performed unevenly against a much more confident Joe Biden.\n\nIn this sense, both Walz and Vance fulfilled their mission. Vance aimed to defuse some of the more controversial positions of the former president, particularly on immigration. When his opponent brought up Springfield, Ohio, where Trump had accused Haitian migrants of eating cats and dogs, the senator focused on the \u201coverwhelmed\u201d schools and hospitals due to the influx of newcomers. \u201cThe people that I'm most worried about in Springfield, Ohio, are the American citizens who have had their lives destroyed by Kamala Harris's open border,\u201d he stressed. He also acknowledged that the Republican Party has \u201cgot to earn people's trust back\u201d on the issue of abortion, one of the electorate\u2019s main concerns.\n\nA seasoned television personality, Vance, 40, appeared comfortable in the debate, even when reminded that he had once called Donald Trump an \u201cAmerican Hitler.\u201d Walz, on the other hand, seemed more nervous. He stumbled when the moderator asked him why he claimed to have witnessed the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989 when he was actually at home in Nebraska. \u201cI'm a knucklehead at times,\u201d admitted the Democrat, known for such slip-ups.\n\nThe two men highlighted their differences at the end of the debate on the issue of democracy. Vance refused to say whether the former businessman had lost the 2020 election. \u201cI think there was a lot of commonality here,\u201d Walz said, however, noting that the topic \u201cis troubling to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will tell you this: that when this is over, we need to shake hands, this election, and the winner needs to be the winner,\u201d he concluded.",

        "text": "Why the vice presidential debate was not what voters expected\nTo the surprise of many Americans, the vice presidential debate was civil, substantive, and focused on the policy issues that people care about the most. The candidates refrained from personal attacks and even found surprising areas of agreement. Citizens interviewed right after the debate ended expressed their appreciation for a debate that wasn\u2019t painful to watch and actually stuck to major issues.\n\nThis was not the only surprise. When the two candidates for vice president came out on stage last night, America had certain expectations based on the campaign so far. Neither candidate lived up to expectations, which was good news for the Republican nominee, Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio) and not so good news for the Democratic nominee, Governor Tim Walz.\n\nIn the weeks before their debate, Vance had become known for two things, both of them fitting firmly into Walz\u2019s characterization of Trump Republicans as \u201cweird.\u201d On July 22, a clip of Vance\u2019s interview on Fox News from 2021 was posted. In it, Vance attacks women who do not have children, suggesting that the \u201cchildless cat ladies,\u201d as they\u2019ve become known, do not have the same stake in America as do people who are parents. The internet went wild, mega star Taylor Swift identified as a childless cat lady in her endorsement of Kamala Harris, t-shirts were printed, and memes proliferated. As if the cat lady stories weren\u2019t trouble enough, Vance followed this up by defending unsubstantiated claims from Springfield, Ohio that Haitian immigrants were stealing and eating their neighbors\u2019 cats and dogs.\n\nIn contrast, Walz spent the weeks before the debate doing what most VP candidates are supposed to do\u2014no harm. And a little good too. Following up on the Midwest Dad, football coach demeanor he so skillfully deployed at the Democratic convention, Walz cut what will surely go down in history as one of the best political commercials ever. The ad features him telling the viewers how to fix the cruise control on his 1979 International Harvester Scout, interspersed with comments on Harris\u2019 opportunity economy. It was widely shared on social media with nearly one million posts so far.\n\nAs the debate opened, Vance took the stage as a historically unpopular VP candidate. Soon after his convention, his unfavorable ratings were 29.3%, and by the time of the debate, they had risen to 45.5%. In contrast, Walz\u2019s unfavorable ratings on the eve of the debate were 36%\u2014a 9.5% better rating than Vance.\n\nBut slightly different candidates than expected showed up on the stage in New York. Vance was not at all \u201cweird\u201d; he didn\u2019t mention cat ladies or Haitian immigrants eating pets. His demeanor and his calm recitation of his positions did him a lot of good. There was plenty to disagree with, and there were times when he pushed the truth. His efforts to sound more moderate probably made some of the far-right supporters angry, but it was all delivered as smoothly as you would expect by a polished debater and Yale Law School grad.\n\nBut if weird Vance didn\u2019t show up, neither did genial Walz. He was clearly nervous, talked too fast, rarely smiled, and his sense of humor didn\u2019t come through. So here too the expectations were not met. Had the Walz of the debate been the Walz of the Harvester commercial, the debate might have been the smooth-talking lawyer versus the commonsense man.\n\nAlthough the immediate flash polls on CNN and CBS showed that both candidates helped themselves, Vance improved his image and Walz didn\u2019t help himself as much as he could have. Substantively, Vance did a better job than Walz in three important ways: He was on the attack on what he called the \u201cHarris-Biden\u201d administration, he offered an articulate defense of his presidential candidate\u2019s record in office, and he constantly brought the questions back to the economy and immigration, the two principal issues on which Trump enjoys an advantage over Harris. In contrast, Walz\u2019s response to each question were less clear, which probably made it harder for viewers to frame an easily remembered impression.\n\nOn specific issues, both candidates had areas of strength. Vance excelled on immigration, the economy, and foreign policy, and he managed to sound reasonable on abortion, taking the edge off one of his ticket\u2019s key weaknesses. Walz was strong on gun safety, housing, and health care. He may have had his strongest moment at the end of the debate when the discussion turned to January 6 and preserving democracy. Whatever his private views may be, Vance would not admit that Joe Biden won the 2020 election, which attracted lots of post-debate attention and may have dented the armor of reasonableness and common sense that he wore to the debate.\n\nIn the past, vice presidential debates have had little measurable impact on the presidential choice. This time could be different, in part because this is the first vice presidential debate not to be followed by a presidential debate. It is the last formal exchange between the candidates of the two parties that the public is likely to hear, which may give it more staying power than in the past. And because the 2024 election is balanced on a knife\u2019s edge, even a small shift could affect the outcome.\n\nHowever, the debate may have been most consequential for the future of the Republican Party. If Trump loses the election, Vance\u2019s performance will strengthen his credentials as the next-generation leader of the MAGA movement. And if Trump wins, Vance\u2019s standing as the heir apparent will be even stronger. In just 90 minutes, Vance transformed himself from an object of ridicule into a man with a bright future.",

        "text": "Trump\u2019s 2020 election case: What Jack Smith\u2019s new filing argues\nThe prosecutor has argued that Trump acted in a private capacity in trying to overturn the US election, and so should not enjoy presidential immunity granted by the Supreme Court.\n\nFederal US prosecutors on Wednesday unveiled their most comprehensive case against former President Donald Trump, focusing on his attempts to overturn the 2020 election results.\n\nThe extensive legal brief, which details the government\u2019s allegations, was made public by US District Judge Tanya Chutkan, who is overseeing the high-profile criminal charges against Trump.\n\n\u201cWhen the defendant lost the 2020 presidential election, he resorted to crimes to try to stay in office,\u201d Jack Smith, special counsel, wrote in the 165-page brief.\n\n\u201cAlthough the defendant was the incumbent president during the charged conspiracies, his scheme was a fundamentally private one,\u201d he added.\n\nThat Trump acted in a private capacity in attempting to overturn the election result is at the heart of the argument Smith\u2019s filing tries to establish. In July, the Supreme Court ruled that presidents had immunity for all official acts carried out while in office.\n\nSmith\u2019s new filing argues that Trump remains subject to trial for his efforts to overturn President Joe Biden\u2019s election victory, because his actions were not performed in his presidential capacity, but rather to advance his campaign\u2019s interests.\n\nHere are some key takeaways from the filing.\n\n\u2018So what?\u2019: Trump on Pence\u2019s safety under threat\n\nOn January 6, 2021, when a riotous mob of Trump supporters attacked Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, seeking to overturn the confirmation of Biden\u2019s win by Congress, some of them chanted slogans suggesting that they wanted to hang Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nPence had refused to follow Trump\u2019s demand that the vice president, as the chair of the US Senate, send the list of electors back to different states for their legislatures to verify. Trump was alleging widespread fraud in the election \u2014 a charge that has since been repeatedly rejected in multiple courts.\n\nAccording to the Smith filing, after one Trump aide told the president that Pence\u2019s safety was at risk, Trump replied, \u201cSo what?\u201d\n\nThe Secret Service had to evacuate Pence and several members of Congress amid fears that they could be physically attacked by the mob.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump posted on what was then known as Twitter \u2014 and is now X: \u201cMike Pence didn\u2019t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution, giving States a chance to certify a corrected set of facts, not the fraudulent or inaccurate ones which they were asked to previously certify. USA demands the truth!\u201d\n\nA central argument that Smith tries to make in the filing is that when Trump addressed the large crowd that he had called to Washington, DC on January 6, he spoke not as president of the US but in his capacity as a Republican Party candidate in the 2020 election.\n\n\u201cHe claimed his \u2018election victory\u2019 was \u2018stolen\u2019, that he would not \u2018concede\u2019, and that \u2018with only three of the seven states in question, we win the presidency of the United States\u2019,\u201d the filing notes.\n\nThe brief alleges that Trump used pronouns like \u201cwe\u201d to speak directly to his voter base rather than to all Americans, including those who didn\u2019t vote for him.\n\n\u201cFinally, the defendant repeatedly aimed accusations at Biden, his principal opponent in the election contest, as would a candidate.\u201d\n\nThe \u2018digital breadcrumb\u2019\n\nProsecutors, in the filing, have outlined a \u201cdigital breadcrumb\u201d of Trump\u2019s tweets and social media posts that they say unequivocally showcase his support for the US Capitol attacks on January 6 \u2014 and ever since.\n\nHis tweets that day, Smith argues in the filing, were \u201cnot a message sent to address a matter of public concern and ease unrest; it was the message of an angry candidate upon the realization that he would lose power\u201d.\n\nProsecutors also alleged that Trump actively observed the Capitol riots via Fox News and Twitter.\n\nThe brief states that Trump \u201csat in the dining room by the Oval Office, where he used his phone to review Twitter and watched television\u201d.\n\n\u201cIn the years after January 6th,\u201d the brief continues, \u201cthe defendant has reiterated his support for and allegiance to rioters who broke in the Capitol, calling them patriots and hostages, providing them with financial assistance.\u201d\n\nHatch Act and staff officials\n\nThe Hatch Act, a law dating back to 1939, prohibits civil servants, while at the federal workplace, from expressing support or opposition for a political party or candidate.\n\nThe filing alleges that Trump broke that law on January 6, while plotting how to overturn the election with some aides, and in subsequent exchanges, too.\n\n\u201cFederal law confirms that the defendant\u2019s campaign-related conversations with these White House staffers were unofficial,\u201d stated Smith. \u201cThe Hatch Act permits certain White House staffers to engage in political activity while on duty, but prohibits them from using their official authority or influence for the purpose of interfering with or affecting the result of an election.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s response\n\nIn characteristic style, the former president hit out at the filing made public on Wednesday on his social media platform, Truth Social.\n\n\u201cDemocrats are Weaponizing the Justice Department against me because they know I am WINNING, and they are desperate to prop up their failing Candidate, Kamala Harris. The DOJ pushed out this latest \u2018hit job\u2019 today because JD Vance humiliated Tim Walz last night in the Debate,\u201d Trump posted defiantly, referring to the October 1 debate between his running mate Vance and Walz, the Democratic Party\u2019s vice-presidential candidate.",

        "text": "October 3, 2024, presidential campaign news\nFormer President Donald Trump on Wednesday said that he would revoke temporary protected status \u2014 which shields migrants from deportation \u2014 for the Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio, if he is reelected in November.\n\n\u201cYou have to remove the people, and you have to bring them back to their own country. They are, in my opinion, it\u2019s not legal,\u201d Trump said in an interview with NewsNation.\n\nAsked if he would revoke the migrants\u2019 temporary protected status, Trump said,\n\n\u201cAbsolutely. I\u2019d revoke it, and I\u2019d bring them back to their country.\u201d\n\nThe former president and his allies have continued to spread misinformation about Haitian migrants in the city of Springfield.\n\nMany Haitians came into the country under a Biden-Harris administration parole program that gives permission to enter to vetted participants with US sponsors. And many have \u201ctemporary protected status,\u201d as CNN has previously reported, which shields them from deportation and allows them to live and work in the country for a limited period of time.\n\nSome received that protection after the Biden-Harris administration expanded the number of Haitians eligible in June. Others have been living in the US with Temporary Protected Status since before the Biden-Harris administration.\n\nTrump, pressed in the Wednesday interview on what would happen if Haiti refused to receive them, said: \u201cThey will,\u201d without providing additional details.\n\n\u201cWell, they\u2019re going to receive them, they\u2019ll receive them. If I bring them back, they\u2019re going to receive them,\u201d Trump said.\n\nDuring Trump\u2019s term as president, the Department of Homeland Security tried to terminate what\u2019s known as temporary protected status for tens of thousands of Haitian immigrants. But the way the Trump administration did so \u2014 and the argument that the protections were no longer merited \u2014 came under intense scrutiny.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s move to terminate the protections were ultimately challenged in court and blocked.\n\nRead the full story.",

I'm Dana Taylor. Today is Thursday, October 3rd, 2024, and this is a special episode of The Excerpt.\n\nWho will win this razor-tight presidential election in November? Well, it depends on who you ask. Historian Allan Lichtman has accurately predicted the outcome of 9 out of the last 10 presidential elections, and he's done it without the use of polling data. Instead, he uses a set of 13 keys to make his predictions. And yes, he is almost always right. Who does he predict will win in November?\n\nHere to discuss is Allan Lichtman, historian and professor at American University. Thanks for joining me, Allan.\n\nAllan Lichtman:\n\nMy pleasure.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nSo let's start with the million-dollar question. Who do you think will win in November?\n\nAllan Lichtman:\n\nIt's not who I think. It's who my system, the 13 keys to the White House predicts, and according to the keys to the White House, we are going to have a new and pathbreaking American president, Kamala Harris will become the first woman President of the United States, at least cracking, if not shattering the glass ceiling, and she'll become the first American president of mixed African and East Asian descent, foreshadowing where our country is going. We are rapidly becoming a majority-minority country. Old white guys like me are on the decline.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nYou've said you have 13 keys that you use to predict a race. What are they?\n\nAllan Lichtman:\n\nThe keys tap into how American presidential elections really work as votes up or down on the strength and performance of the White House party. They look at things like midterm elections, incumbency, contests for the incumbent party nomination, third parties, short and long-term economy, policy change, social unrest, scandal, foreign/military failures and successes. And only two keys have anything to do with the candidates. And they're very high threshold keys assessing whether the candidates are one of those once-in-a-generational, across the board, transformational candidates like Franklin Roosevelt or Ronald Reagan. And the way the system works, five or fewer keys, the White House party has predicted winners, six or more negative keys, they're predicted losers.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nYou predicted Donald Trump's win over Hillary Clinton in 2016. This time around your predicting Trump will lose to Kamala Harris. Which key or keys that he got the first time around is he not winning this time?\n\nAllan Lichtman:\n\nRemember, the theory is elections are primarily referenda on the strength and performance of the White House party. And when I predicted Donald Trump's win in 2016, I said given that there are six or more negative keys against the White House party, any generic Republican would have won in 2016. And of course, Barack Obama had won in 2012, but when you got to 2016, you had an open seat, no incumbent. You had a huge internal party battle between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton. You didn't have a big follow-up to the Affordable Care Act or the dispatch of Bin Laden, so the situation had fundamentally changed in 2016.\n\nThen we get to this year, and of course, now we have a new set of keys against the incumbent Democrats. And this time they avoided a big contest because they got smart and united behind Harris. There was major policy change between the Trump and the Biden administration in areas like the environment, immigration, infrastructure, climate change, and I assessed that the Biden administration achieved a major success in Ukraine.\n\nIt was Biden and Biden alone who put together the coalition of the West that stopped Putin from conquering Ukraine and threatening America's national security by going after our NATO allies. And in the face of lukewarm Republican support, it was Biden whose support has helped keep Ukraine alive for over two and a half years and make an incursion into Russia. I deem this will go down as an historic presidential achievement.\n\nSo situations change year to year, and the keys gauge those changing situations.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nThe keys include everything from a candidate's charisma to foreign military successes and failures. As you've said, how did Biden's late decision to not seek another term affect your prediction that Harris will win in November?\n\nAllan Lichtman:\n\nThe keys fully took into account this historically unprecedented withdrawal of the sitting president on the eve of the party convention and the turn to a new nominee. First of all, the Biden withdrawal cost the incumbent Democrats one key, the incumbency key. But by uniting behind Harris, they saved the contest key. No incumbent party has even reelected since 1900 when they lost both those keys, so one key down.\n\nAnd I also assess that the switch to Harris might have saved the Democrats two other keys. First, the third party key because voters no longer had to choose between two old white guys. Hate to say that being an old white guy myself, but it's true. That might've salvaged the third party key with the fizzling of the RFK Jr. campaign and then his suspending his campaign.\n\nThen there's the social unrest key. Protests were directed against Biden as the decision maker, but he's now in the background. Harris is front and center, and that's dampened social unrest. So the switch cost the party one key, but may have salvaged two other keys.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nWhich keys are most important, would you say, to the Harris campaign? Do any carry more weight than others?\n\nAllan Lichtman:\n\nAll the keys are equally weighted, and that's one of the secrets to the success of the keys over 40 years, ever since I predicted Ronald Reagan's reelection in April 1982, nearly three years ahead of time during what was then the worst recession since the Great Depression when 60% of Americans said he was too old to run again.\n\nSo the secret is I don't weight the keys, they all count equally. The problem with weighting is you've got to weight keys or any indicators based on past elections, and those weights will change unpredictably in the next election that you don't know and will create errors.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nWhich keys does the Trump campaign have a lock on?\n\nAllan Lichtman:\n\nHere are the keys that count against the White House party and obviously favor Trump. The mandate key because Democrats lost US House seats in 2022. Incumbency, it's an open seat. And incumbent charisma, because Harris, whatever you may think of her, is certainly not yet a Franklin Roosevelt. And the Democrats also lose the foreign policy/military policy failure key for Gaza, which is a humanitarian disaster with no end in sight. The US does not have boots on the ground there, but we are deeply invested in the Middle East. That's four keys definitively lost, two keys short of what would be necessary to predict Harris's defeat and Donald Trump returning to the White House.\n\nThe shakiest key is the foreign policy success key, which I described to you previously. But even if things would go horribly wrong in Ukraine, and I certainly don't expect that, that would still be only five keys down, the system would still predict under any circumstances a Harris victory. There aren't enough negative keys to go against the prediction of a Harris win and a Trump loss.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nDoes your model account for the increasing polarization in American politics and its impact on elections? Does it factor in at all when predicting who will win the presidency?\n\nAllan Lichtman:\n\nIt absolutely accounts for polarization. The model is incredibly robust. It goes all the way back to 1860 in development, the horse and buggy days of politics, the Civil War era when things were obviously even more polarized than today. It goes back to a time when we had no radio, no television, no automobiles, no planes, no polls. We were an agricultural society, women didn't vote, African Americans were enslaved. So the model takes into account vastly greater changes in our politics, our society, our economy, and our demography than anything that's occurred recently.\n\nIn 2008, critics said to me, \"You got to change your model. We have an African American running. Never had that before. America's not ready for an African American.\" I said, \"No, my model's robust. I don't change it.\" And of course, I was right in predicting Obama.\n\nIn 2016 after I predicted Trump, the Access Hollywood tape came out and people said, \"You've got to change your model. We've never had a presidential candidate on tape bragging about sexually assaulting women.\" And I said, \"No, I don't change my model because it's so robust.\"\n\nSo if I tried to fiddle with my model in response to what people say are contemporary changes, I would just make errors. The keys are indeed the northern star of prediction. They don't change. Now, I'm not so arrogant to say the pattern of 160 years of history can never change. But the point is if such a change occurred, you would never know it in advance. You could only gauge it after the fact. That's why you don't fiddle with your model in advance.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nKamala Harris electrified the Democratic Convention. Despite his losses in 2020, Donald Trump has maintained his hold on the Republican base. When it comes to determining an objective key like a candidate's charisma, how are you able to assess it and choose a winner?\n\nAllan Lichtman:\n\nYeah, I am frequently criticized by saying, \"How can you say Trump is not charismatic?\" But you have to understand, I have a very specific definition of the key, and I've turned this key ever since 1860. My definition is you have to be an across-the-board, broadly appealing candidate. You cannot appeal to just a narrow base.\n\nSince 1900, there have only been half a dozen such candidates that fulfilled that criteria, and we pretty much know who they are. They're not William Howard Taft and Gerald Ford. They're Teddy Roosevelt, Franklin Roosevelt, Dwight Eisenhower. Of course, he was a war hero. John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama in 2008. That's it.\n\nWhatever you may think of Trump, he doesn't fit the criteria because he appeals to a narrow base. In four years as president, his approval rating was 41%, right at the bottom, his narrow base. In two elections, he lost the vote of the people by a combined 10 million votes. FDR and Reagan won six elections by landslide. So he clearly doesn't qualify.\n\nSo if you look at my definition, and you'll look at how I've turned the keys, and you look at things like approval ratings, election results, commentary on the candidates, there's no mystery about who does and does not fulfill the criteria.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nThe margins of our own USA Today polling show a race that's too close to call. Do you think that this will be a tight race and could an October surprise upend your prediction?\n\nAllan Lichtman:\n\nThe biggest myth in American political analysis in history is the October surprise. There has never been an October surprise that's changed my prediction. I've always made my predictions before then and never changed them. And if I had responded to so-called October surprises like the Access Hollywood tape, I would have made errors.\n\nAnd the big lesson here is keep your eye on the big picture of governance as gauged by the keys to the White House. Keys have a message. Governing, not campaigning is what counts in presidential elections. That's why the so-called October surprises have never made a difference. Does that mean nothing could ever happen that could change the model? Of course, but in 40 years it hasn't happened.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nI mentioned that you correctly predicted nine of the last 10 presidential election outcomes, save one, in 2000 when George W. Bush defeated Al Gore, and that was a squeaker. Did you question your formula or any of the 13 keys following that election? What happened there?\n\nAllan Lichtman:\n\nI picked Gore, and I was right because as I proved in my report to the United States Commission on Civil Rights, still on their website, the wrong candidate won Florida and the wrong candidate was elected president. As I proved overwhelmingly, Florida rejected ballots actually cast by overwhelmingly Democratic Black voters as compared to ballots cast by heavily white Republican voters.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nFascinating stuff. Thank you so much for being on The Excerpt, Allan.\n\nAllan Lichtman:\n\nMy great pleasure. Take care.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nThanks to our senior producers, Shannon Rae Green and Kaely Monahan, for their production assistance. Our executive producer is Laura Beatty.

Poll: Most Americans are concerned about fraud in the 2024 election, most Americans are worried about it . Trump supporters also think all immigrants who came into the country illegally should be deported .",
        "text": "Driven by Republicans, most Americans are concerned about fraud in the 2024 election\nDriven by Republicans, most Americans are concerned about fraud in the 2024 election\n\ntoggle caption Alex Brandon/AP\n\nA majority of Americans worry this year\u2019s general election will be tainted by fraud, according to a new NPR/PBS News/Marist poll out Thursday \u2014 an ominous finding for the thousands of local election officials across the country tasked with administering voting.\n\nAlmost 6-in-10 Americans say they\u2019re concerned or very concerned that there will be voter fraud this election, a number that experts say is driven in large part by Donald Trump\u2019s continued false insistence that elections can\u2019t be trusted. Eighty-eight percent of voters who say they support the former president say they are concerned there will be fraud, compared with 29% of those who support the Democratic nominee, Kamala Harris.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIn the four years since the 2020 election, there has never been any evidence of widespread voter fraud in that contest, and numerous audits, studies and investigations (including those led by Republicans) have confirmed the results many times over.\n\nStill, as voting has begun in many parts of the country, election officials are struggling to persuade voters listening to political figures who insist the results will be tainted.\n\nLoading...\n\nLocal election officials say they\u2019ve spent countless hours trying to educate voters on the checks and balances that make fraud unlikely and rare, but it\u2019s unclear those efforts have made much of a dent. And they worry the stage is set for Trump again to try to overturn the results, or for his followers to commit violence, if they feel the election was stolen from him.\n\n\u201cThis conversation is so much deeper than even the mechanics of election administration,\u201d said Stephen Richer, the Republican county recorder in Maricopa County, Ariz. \u201cIt\u2019s more about, how do you convince someone of the truth?\u201d\n\nRicher, who lost a reelection bid earlier this year to a GOP challenger, has continuously pushed back against baseless fraud claims since he took office after Trump\u2019s loss in 2020. And he\u2019s talked openly about the threats he\u2019s received, including from a number of men who have been charged for threatening to kill him.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIn an interview with NPR last month, Richer said the specific voting conspiracy theory that has \u201cspiked\u201d in recent months is about non-U.S. citizens illegally voting and influencing results.\n\nThe new NPR/PBS News/Marist poll confirmed that trend, with 52% of respondents saying they were concerned noncitizens would vote for president in this year\u2019s election, even though that is illegal, and there has never been evidence to support the idea that noncitizens register and vote in anything but microscopic numbers.\n\nNPR reported in the spring that far-right figures \u2014 including Trump, X owner Elon Musk and conservative attorney Cleta Mitchell \u2014 were beginning to center their voting messaging around noncitizens ahead of the presidential election. The new survey found that 85% of Trump supporters said they were concerned about noncitizen voting.\n\nNinety percent of Trump supporters also think all immigrants who came into the country illegally should be deported.\n\nThe mass deportation idea, a draconian step favored by Trump, is now mainstream, with 59% of voters agreeing with the idea.\n\nMarist interviewed 1,628 adults for the survey, which was conducted Friday through Tuesday. The overall poll sample has a margin of error of +/- 3.3 percentage points, with larger margins of error for subgroups.\n\n\n\nTrust is higher in a voter\u2019s local elections\n\nIt\u2019s long been a truism in elections that voters have much less trust in elections in other places, but have more faith in the voting system where they live. The new poll results bear that out as well.\n\nClose to 80% of voters surveyed said they were confident that their state or local government would run a fair and accurate election this November.\n\nTina Barton, a Republican former election official from Rochester Hills, Mich., told NPR that the most effective way to build confidence in elections is to keep reminding people that voting is a local activity and election officials are human beings in their community as well.\n\n\u201cThese are people who live and work in your neighborhood, go to the same church you do, your kids play soccer together,\u201d Barton said. \u201cThis is still a neighborhood transaction.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnother partisan divide likely in voting methods\n\nThe poll also provided more insight into how people plan to cast ballots this year, with the long-term trend of more and more early voting seeming poised to continue.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nRoughly half of registered voters said they planned to vote early, either in-person at a polling place or by mail, and half said they planned to vote in-person on Election Day.\n\nLoading...\n\nSome partisan differences in those methods still exist, after Trump\u2019s efforts in 2020 to demonize absentee voting during the pandemic. About 71% of likely voters who say they plan to vote by mail support Harris, while 58% of planned Election Day voters say they back Trump.\n\n\n\nHarris holds a slim lead over Trump\n\nThe presidential race continues to be a toss-up.\n\nAmong likely voters \u2014 which Marist describes as voters who say they are definitely voting this year \u2014 Harris holds a slim lead over Trump, 50% to 48%. That lines up with the previous NPR/PBS News/Marist survey, in September, and national polling averages.\n\nTrump holds a narrow, 4-point edge with independents, and the survey points to a vast gender gap: Trump leads Harris by 16 percentage points with men, while Harris outpaces Trump with women by 18 points.",

Please consider supporting SCMP\u2019s journalism by subscribing . Get faster notifications on the latest updates by downloading our app\n\nThe vice-presidential debate between US senator J.D. Vance of Ohio and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz on Tuesday rarely strayed outside of domestic issues following an opening question on the Israel-Iran conflict \u2013 but when it did, China was the focus.\n\nVance, the VP pick for Donald Trump , did his best to tie his boss\u2019s opponent, Vice-President Kamala Harris , to the policies of current US President Joe Biden . However, he made an exception when praising Biden for continuing \u201csome of the Trump tariffs\u201d, and characterised Harris as having \u201crun away from Joe Biden\u2019s record\u201d on the issue. He also slammed Biden\u2019s environmental policies for driving money into China-produced solar panels.\n\nWalz, who spent time in the 1980s and 90s in China, first as a teacher and then an organiser of student exchanges, defended his time there as helping him \u201cunderstand the world\u201d, and implied that his experiences had given him a more negative view of Chinese President Xi Jinping than Trump, who he also characterised as having started \u201ca trade war that he ends up losing\u201d.\n\nAfter an opening in which both men broadly sided with Israel in the present Middle East conflicts with Gaza and Iran, the pair diverged, particularly on their key issues. For Walz, that was abortion, a subject where Vance admitted that the Republican party had lost the confidence of Americans; for Vance, it was immigration, where he characterised Harris as being weak on America\u2019s border with Mexico. They also debated crime, energy resources, child care and health care, among other subjects.\n\nMore from our coverage of the election\n\nReporting by Mark Magnier in New York and Igor Patrick and Khushboo Razdan in Washington",

However, this fall, we will also observe another critically important tradition\u2014Election Day\n\n\n\nAs we approach November, let\u2019s remember that voting is not just a right, it is a responsibility. In a republic form of government, the power rests with the people. That power is exercised primarily through voting. When we do not vote, we abdicate that power to those who do\u2014 and often to those who do not share our perspectives, beliefs, or values.\n\n\n\nWhether we are voting for positions in local government, the state legislature, Congress, or the White House, we have the opportunity to shape the future of our Republic by electing those who reflect our principles, exhibit the character we teach our children, and will do the hard work necessary to preserve liberty for our individual lives and businesses.\n\n\n\nI won my first election to the Tyler City Council in 2005 with just 301 total votes. I guarantee you that every vote mattered in that election. By comparison, in the 2020 presidential election, approximately 155 million votes were cast nationwide, and I can guarantee you that every one of those votes mattered as well. Why? Because each vote represents a voice that matters\u2014it\u2019s your voice.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s critical, however, that our elections are reserved solely for Americans. This means we must engage at the ground level to ensure that our policies, practices, and laws support free, fair, and honest elections for those who are eligible to vote and impose stiff preventative measures and penalties for those who are not.\n\n\n\nAs a former County Judge, I often spoke about the importance of \u201cSALTY\u201d elections\u2014Secure, Accurate, Legal, Transparent elections with YOU involved in every step of the process. Today, in my role representing the First District of Texas in Congress, I repeat this mantra often.\n\n\n\nIn Article I, Section 4 of the Constitution, the Founding Fathers gave states the primary authority to administer their own elections to prevent the federal government from having unchecked control. While Congress plays a limited role, it provides oversight and support to states conducting their elections.\n\n\n\nJust months into my freshman term in Congress, I introduced legislation to restore confidence in our American election system. This bill became part of the American Confidence in Elections (ACE) Act, the key Republican election integrity measure. The ACE Act emphasizes strong election reforms while upholding the Constitution, federalism, and conservative principles.\n\n\n\nI also co-sponsored Chip Roy\u2019s Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, which passed the House over the summer. This bill would require proof of citizenship when individuals register to vote and remove non-citizens from voter rolls. I believe this is common sense. The SAVE Act also empowers citizens with a private right of action to bring civil suits against election officials who fail to uphold the proof of citizenship requirement for voter registration.\n\n\n\nThe importance of defending the American people\u2019s right to have a say in their future has echoed throughout history. In his Gettysburg Address, President Abraham Lincoln reaffirmed that ours is a \u201cgovernment of the people, by the people, for the people.\u201d But President Ronald Reagan solemnly reminded us that \u201cfreedom is a fragile thing and is never more than one generation away from extinction.\u201d His solution was that \u201cit must be fought for and defended constantly by each generation, for it comes only once to a people.\u201d\n\n\n\nReagan\u2019s caution is a call to action for each of us. What part will each of us play to ensure that we have \u201cSALTY\u201d elections this November and beyond? Everyone can do something\u2014serve as a poll worker, a party volunteer, a block walker, a voter registrar, or as an informed voter who engages with neighbors and shows up to vote.\n\n\n\nAs we walk into that voting booth, let us each remember those who have gone before us to preserve our freedoms. When we cast our vote, let us speak to our children about this solemn responsibility. And let us pause to reflect on the immense privilege we enjoy as Americans\u2014to have a say in who represents us.\n\n\n\nMay these freedoms we enjoy as Americans not be relinquished on our watch. May we defend them, may we teach our children to cherish them, and may we never see a day when they are extinguished from our country. Most importantly, may God be with us in this fight, and may He bless and protect our Republic for generations to come. We must remain that shining city on a hill.

        "text": "The US election is on a knife edge. My trip to Georgia showed how easily it could end in tragedy | Oliver Laughland\nA few weeks ago, I found myself standing in the white marble atrium of Georgia\u2019s state capitol building, watching a scene that encapsulated much of the presidential race. To my right: a cluster of election conspiracy theorists who still believe Donald Trump won in 2020. To my left, a group of voting rights campaigners, singing an old spiritual popularised during the civil rights era.\n\nThey were here to observe last-minute efforts by hard-right officials to alter the way in which votes will be counted next month. The measures, many say, will sow doubt in this crucial swing state, creating chaos that is likely to favour Trump.\n\nA man wearing a Trump T-shirt had weaved his way into the voting rights group \u2013 most of whom were Black \u2013 and was grinning with satisfied amusement. Others started hanging pro-Trump flags behind them as police officers intervened. The conspiracy theorists \u2013 mostly white \u2013 pointed and laughed.\n\n10:42 Can Kamala Harris defeat Trump\u2019s election lies in battleground Georgia? \u2013 video\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it a bit disrespectful?\u201d I asked the giggling Trump supporter to my right.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you get to tell me what you think is disrespectful,\u201d she said with contempt, while chewing gum. \u201cI determine what I want to do.\u201d\n\nIn a building dotted with relics of the past \u2013 from a plaque honouring the Confederate lieutenant William Ambrose Wright to a bronze statue of Martin Luther King \u2013 there was an acute sense of the precipice on which the country now sits and the prospect of history repeating itself. First, by re-electing Trump; second, by empowering the old anti-democratic values that he has come to embody. This election has the potential to end in tragedy and farce simultaneously.\n\nFor the next six weeks, I am travelling the US with the film-maker Tom Silverstone for our series Anywhere but Washington. The aim is not to predict who will win \u2013 a question that American cable news is perpetually obsessed with, but one that remains unanswerable until 5 November. Polling indicates an unwaveringly close race, not only in Georgia, but in all seven critical battleground states. Our focus, instead, is the communities with the most at stake and the policy failures and other forces guiding the doom spiral of polarisation in American politics. And we will be asking if there is hope for progress, regardless of the outcome.\n\nIn Georgia, a centre of election denialism in 2020 and the site of Trump\u2019s failed efforts to press officials into \u201cfinding\u201d him enough votes to overturn the result, the microcosms for the presidential election extend well beyond the state capitol building. Out in the Atlanta suburbs, I followed a race for the 48th senate district, where a young Democrat, Ashwin Ramaswami, is running against the incumbent Republican, Shawn Still.\n\nRamaswami, a lean, bespectacled computer science graduate, is vying to become the first Indian American gen Z state senator here. He was inspired to run, he said, after finding out that Still was charged with several felony crimes as part of an alleged plot to fraudulently seize the 2020 election for Trump. Still\u2019s case is part of a sprawling election racketeering prosecution in Atlanta that saw him charged alongside Trump and 17 others. (Trump and Still have pleaded not guilty.)\n\nView image in fullscreen Oliver Laughland meets Ashwin Ramaswami, the Democratic candidate for state senate in Georgia\u2019s 48th district. Photograph: Tom Silverstone/The Guardian\n\nThe 25 year-old\u2019s parents beamed with pride as they discussed their son\u2019s candidacy and told me they migrated to the US from the same region of India as Kamala Harris\u2019s mother, Shyamala Gopalan. \u201cShe\u2019s going to break the ceiling,\u201d said his mother, Kalyani. \u201cAnd Ashwin is part of that.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Georgia state senator Shawn Still, who has been charged with seven felonies as part of an alleged plot to fraudulently seize the 2020 election. Photograph: Fulton County Sheriff\u2019S Office/EPA\n\nIt was in this competitive race, situated in rapidly diversifying neighbourhoods, that I found my first kernel of hope and clarity. As he canvassed on the streets, Ramaswami spoke with a young voter who was unaware that her state senator had been involved in an alleged criminal enterprise to subvert democracy. She listened attentively as Ramaswami made his pitch, which included fluid arguments for gun control and abortion rights.\n\n\u201cWe need people who are like-minded and around our age to make the difference,\u201d she said. \u201cEverything has to evolve. If we can evolve in our technology, why can\u2019t we evolve in our government?\u201d\n\nLike many other elected Republicans in Georgia, Still did not respond to our interview requests. And so, in a bid to find more voices on the other side, we drove out to the conservative-leaning county of Fayette. Here, we stumbled across a gargantuan bus, daubed in the stars and stripes and a giant portrait of a smiling Trump.\n\nThe Trump Bus, as it\u2019s called, has been rolling around the state since 2015, when its owner, Danny Hamilton, got swept up in the Maga movement. It serves as a giant billboard and a vast emporium of Trump-themed goods.\n\nHe showed me the merchandise. It was largely T-shirts, caps and flags, but also included more sinister items, such as a large Trump-branded flick knife. Most of it was imported from China. I asked whether Trump\u2019s pledge to impose large tariffs on Chinese imports concerned him.\n\nView image in fullscreen Ramaswami speaking to a young voter on the campaign trail. Photograph: Tom Silverstone/The Guardian\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a multimillionaire,\u201d he said, revealing this is all a personal passion project. \u201cI don\u2019t need this shit.\u201d\n\nWhile Trumpism is a multifaceted political movement, I have found that some of the billionaire\u2019s most ardent backers may have the least to lose in a high-stakes election.\n\nAll of those congregated around the bus were well versed in the conspiracy-tinged lexicon of the Trump bubble. But talk of the two recent assassination attempts on the former president moved the needle to a new level \u2013 whereby \u201cradical Democrats\u201d are believed to have orchestrated the incidents.\n\nMany of the fears expressed on both sides of the aisle \u2013 of widespread political violence, targeted killings and a descent into autocratic government \u2013 might have seemed farcical four years ago. But as I looked down at the flick knife with Trump\u2019s face emblazoned on the handle, it became clearer that they are more realistic now than at any time in recent history.",

        "text": "Biden says he doesn\u2019t know whether Israel is holding up peace deal to influence 2024 US election\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Joe Biden had terse words for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday, and said he didn\u2019t know whether the Israeli leader was holding up a Mideast peace deal in order to influence the outcome of the 2024 U.S. presidential election.\n\n\u201cNo administration has helped Israel more than I have. None. None. None. And I think Bibi should remember that,\u201d he said, referring to the Israeli leader by his nickname. \u201cAnd whether he\u2019s trying to influence the election, I don\u2019t know, but I\u2019m not counting on that.\u201d\n\nBiden, in a rare appearance in the White House press briefing room, was responding to comments made by one of his allies, Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., who told CNN this week that he was concerned Netanyahu had little interest in a peace deal in part because of U.S. politics.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you have to be a hopeless cynic to read some of Israel\u2019s actions, some of Prime Minister Netanyahu\u2019s actions, as connected to the American election,\u201d Murphy said.\n\nBiden and Netanyahu have long managed a complicated relationship, but they\u2019re running out of space to maneuver as their views on the Gaza war diverge and their political futures hang in the balance.\n\nFor Biden, a diplomatic deal would help resolve a deep divide among Democrats over the war and shore up support for Vice President Kamala Harris, making one fewer global conflict for her to manage should she win next month. Netanyahu has his own political concerns closer to home: His far-right coalition would abandon him if he stopped the war, and he could lose power and have to face his own legal problems. And Israel has been decimating Hezbollah\u2019s leadership, so there is little incentive to stop now.\n\nWhat to know about Trump\u2019s second term:\n\nStaffing the administration: Here are the people Trump has picked recess appointments Follow all of our coverage as Donald Trump assembles his second administration.\n\nBiden has long pushed for a diplomatic deal, and he and his aides have indicated several times over the past few months that such an agreement was close. But it never seems to materialize, and in some cases, Netanyahu has publicly resisted the prospect while U.S. and Israeli officials continue to talk in private about eking out a deal.\n\nJust last week, the U.S., France and other allies jointly called for an immediate 21-day Israel-Hezbollah cease-fire, and expected Israel to welcome if not fully endorse the plan. Instead, Netanyahu publicly rejected it, telling leaders gathered for the U.N. General Assembly that Israel would \u201ccontinue degrading Hezbollah until all our objectives are met.\u201d\n\nIsrael has pressed forward on two fronts, killing top Hezbollah leaders and pursuing a ground incursion into Lebanon and conducting strikes in Gaza that killed dozens, including children. And the nation has vowed to retaliate for Iran\u2019s ballistic missile attack this week.\n\nOil prices rose 5% Thursday as concerns mounted that Israel would hit Iranian oil facilities as payback; a surge in gas prices so close to the election would be a blow to Harris, particularly after strong economic news Friday.\n\nBiden said there had been no decision yet on what type of response there would be toward Iran, though \u201cI think if I were in their shoes, I\u2019d be thinking about other alternatives than striking oil fields.\u201d\n\nHe pushed back against the idea that he was seeking a meeting with Netanyahu to discuss the response to Iran. He isn\u2019t, he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m assuming when they make a decision on how they\u2019re going to respond, we will then have a discussion,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Netanyahu has grown increasingly resistant to Biden\u2019s public charm offensives and private pleading, prompting the president\u2019s more assertive pushback. And Biden has in turn publicly held up delivery of heavy bombs to Israel and increasingly voiced concerns over an all-out war in the Middle East.\n\nDespite their long acquaintanceship, the two are not close or particularly friendly. When Biden was visiting Israel as vice president under Barack Obama, he and other U.S. officials were taken aback by an Israeli government announcement of new Jewish settlements in the West Bank, something the administration strongly opposed.\n\nNevertheless, Biden has remained consistent in his support for Israel\u2019s defense and security. In the aftermath of the deadly Oct. 7 Hamas attacks in Israel, he hugged Netanyahu on the tarmac of the airport in Tel Aviv. Since then, with few exceptions, Biden has supported ongoing and enhanced U.S. arms transfers to Israel while at the same time cautioning the Israelis to be careful in their responses to avoid civilian casualties.\n\n\u201cThe Israelis have every right to respond to the vicious attacks on them, not just from the Iranians, but from everyone from Hezbollah to Houthis,\u201d Biden said Friday. \u201cBut the fact is that they have to be very much more careful about dealing with civilian casualties.\u201d\n\nBiden has also ordered the U.S. military to step up its profile in the region to protect Israel from attacks by Hamas, Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen and Iran itself. In April, and again earlier this week, the U.S. was a leading player in shooting down missiles fired by Iran into Israel.\n\nBy contrast, Republican Donald Trump and Netanyahu have had a much more cordial relationship. Trump hosted Netanyahu in July. While president, Trump initiated policy changes that Netanyahu applauded, including recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, moving the U.S. embassy there from Tel Aviv, recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights and rescinding a decades-old U.S. legal determination that Jewish settlements in the West Bank were inconsistent with international law.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Matthew Lee and Aamer Madhani contributed to this report.",

        "text": "Black and Arab American voters could swing Michigan's 2024 election\nThe entire nation will vote on the next president of the United States this fall, but the election will likely come down to seven key swing states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. With the outsized importance of these states, it's worth taking a closer look at the data we have in each of them \u2014 not just where the presidential race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump stands today, but also each candidate's path to victory and what issues could tip the election. Third in our series is the Great Lakes State, Michigan.\n\nThe history\n\nMichigan\u2019s status as a presidential swing state is a somewhat new phenomenon. While Republicans have frequently won state and local offices over the last few decades, the state only recently became a true battleground at the presidential level. From 1992 to 2012, Democratic presidential candidates consistently won Michigan by around 5 to 10 percentage points. But in 2016, Trump flipped the state, winning by a razor-thin margin of 0.2 points.\n\nThe results of the last six presidential elections in Michigan compared with the national popular vote. Katie Marriner and Amina Brown for 538\n\nMichigan Democrats have fared quite well since then, winning every statewide office twice and flipping the state legislature along with multiple U.S. House seats. In 2020, President Joe Biden won the state by 3 points, his largest margin among the core seven swing states that year. But Republicans are still gunning hard for the state\u2019s 15 electoral votes, and the 2024 data shows they have a realistic chance of winning them this year.\n\nThe 2024 polls\n\nHarris currently leads Trump by about 2 points in 538\u2019s presidential polling average of the race.* That\u2019s an inversion of where the race stood before Biden dropped out, however, when Trump was leading by a little over 2 points.\n\n538's 2024 presidential polling average in Michigan. 538 Photo Illustration\n\nThe demographics\n\nBlack voters make up about 13 percent of Michigan\u2019s electorate, and in 2020, 92 percent supported Biden, according to exit polls. But so far in 2024, Harris seems to be running way behind that benchmark. An average of polls conducted in Michigan since Sept. 4 shows the Democratic share of the Black electorate dropping by a precipitous 21 points on margin since 2020.** That would be a truly seismic shift in Michigan politics, but there are reasons to believe those numbers may not fully materialize come Election Day.\n\nIn 2022, national polls estimated a huge drop in Democratic support among Black voters \u2014 but the decline ended up being only a couple of points. Indeed, in Michigan\u2019s governor\u2019s race, the 2022 Democratic share of the Black vote mostly held steady from 2020, either rising or falling a couple of points, depending on the estimate.\n\nEvery year is different, and polling errors from one cycle don\u2019t necessarily carry over to the next. So we can\u2019t say with any certainty that the same phenomenon is happening again this cycle \u2026 but we can speculate. A 21-point shift on margin among Black voters would be a political earthquake in Michigan, and as of now, the likelier explanation is probably something closer to 2022, when polls struggled to capture a full picture of the Black electorate.\n\nRecent polls also show a large drop in Democratic support among young voters. An average of polls conducted in the state over the last month shows Democratic support among 18- to 29-year-olds declining by 13 points on margin from 2020.\n\nYoung voters are key to any Democratic victory, but especially so in Michigan, which had the highest youth turnout in the nation in the 2022 midterms. College students in particular are sure to play a pivotal role in both the presidential election and in key U.S. House races across the state. While polls sometimes have a hard time capturing a representative sample of young voters, after a year marked by intense student protests over the Biden administration\u2019s handling of the war between Israel and Hamas, Democrats have their work cut out for them to claw back support among the demographic.\n\nAnd young voters aren\u2019t the only key demographic in Michigan that has been upended by the war in Gaza. Arab Americans make up about 4 percent of the state population (the highest share of any state in the country), and many prominent Arab American leaders in the state have harshly criticized the Biden administration\u2019s response to the conflict. These critiques helped galvanize the Uncommitted Movement, which encouraged votes against Biden in the Democratic presidential primary earlier this year. And since becoming the Democratic nominee, Harris has been dogged by pro-Palestinian activists in Michigan, with protestors interrupting an August rally in Detroit.\n\nIn 2020, Arab Americans nationwide leaned heavily toward Democrats. But according to a new national poll conducted by John Zogby Strategies for the Arab American Institute, that advantage isn\u2019t likely to continue this year. Trump and Harris are about tied in the low 40s in the survey of Arab American voters, a far cry from the 24-point advantage that Biden had in 2020. While support for Trump among the demographic has grown about 7 percent since 2020, much of the change comes from collapsing Democratic support, which has dropped by 18 percent since 2020.\n\nPart of that could be because GOP policies on Israel are even less appealing to many anti-war activists than the Democrats\u2019, so many disenchanted Arab American voters may choose to either stay home on Election Day or vote for a third-party candidate rather than mark their ballots for Trump. Indeed, third-party candidates are pulling 12 percent of the vote among Arab Americans nationally in the Zogby poll, much higher than the 3 percent they received among the demographic in 2020 and far more than we\u2019ve seen in polls of the general population. This was a national survey, not specific to Michigan, but given the state\u2019s competitiveness, any Democratic decline among this group of voters could still help the GOP\u2019s chances.\n\nThe issues\n\nThe most important issues to Michiganders this election are in some ways the opposite of what you might expect. Of course, the economy dominates Michigan voters\u2019 concerns in the same way it does nationwide. But an issue like abortion, which appeared to have been mostly settled in the state, still ranks high in voters\u2019 minds, on par with voters nationally. Meanwhile, an issue like the war between Israel and Hamas, which is especially important in Michigan, may not be as singularly motivating as expected.\n\nMichigan was one of the first states in the country to legalize abortion after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Voters in 2022 passed Proposition 3, a constitutional amendment that guaranteed the right to an abortion up until fetal viability. The year after that, the state legislature expanded reproductive rights even further, making Michigan one of the most protected states for abortion rights in the Midwest.\n\nAfter this dramatic expansion of abortion rights in the state, some signs indicated that Michiganders would be less motivated by the issue in 2024 than voters in other states. But new polling shows that abortion is still one of the top issues for Michigan voters. In The New York Times/Siena College\u2019s latest poll of the state, 16 percent of registered voters said that abortion was the most important issue in determining their vote in November, the second-most frequent response behind the economy.\n\nThat figure mirrors a recent nationwide poll from the same pollster that showed 14 percent of voters listing abortion as the most important issue. National and state-level polling from Emerson College also shows abortion mattering to Michiganders roughly as much as it does to voters nationwide.\n\nThat\u2019s probably welcome news to Democrats in the state, who are trying to capitalize on the issue by warning that the state\u2019s new abortion protections could be steamrolled by a national abortion ban if the GOP wins control of Congress. But some Michigan Republicans remain skeptical that the issue will end up motivating many voters in the state come Election Day, given the network of protections already in place.\n\nBut while abortion ranks higher in importance among Michiganders than some expected, another issue that has rocked state politics in the last year is barely registering among voters\u2019 top priorities.\n\nAs I wrote earlier, the war in Gaza has been a mobilizing issue for many Michiganders, particularly Arab Americans and young voters. But less than 1 percent of respondents in The New York Times/Siena College Michigan survey said that \u201cthe Middle East/Israel/Palestinians\u201d was most important to their vote.\n\nThat certainly doesn\u2019t mean that less than 1 percent of the state\u2019s residents care about the topic (the survey only asked what the most important issue was for respondents), but it does indicate that the war may not be top-of-mind for Michigan voters as a whole in the way that many observers predicted \u2014 in line with what we\u2019ve seen nationally, including among younger voters.\n\nThe downballot races\n\nThe presidential race isn\u2019t the only close contest in Michigan this year \u2014 the state is hosting competitive fights for a U.S. Senate seat, two U.S. House seats and control of the state House.\n\nIn the state\u2019s U.S. Senate race, Rep. Elissa Slotkin is hoping to keep the seat in Democratic hands following the retirement of Sen. Debbie Stabenow. She faces former Rep. Mike Rogers, a Republican who used to represent much of the same Lansing-area turf that Slotkin now holds, following the state's redistricting. 538\u2019s polling average of the race shows Slotkin with a lead of about 5 points.\n\n538's 2024 U.S. Senate polling average in Michigan. 538 Photo Illustration\n\nWhile the state\u2019s U.S. Senate seat may be a harder win, Republicans are trying to at least capture a few of Michigan\u2019s U.S. House districts. In the 7th District, the GOP is hoping to capitalize on Slotkin\u2019s departure from the House by boosting former state Sen. Tom Barrett, who lost to Slotkin in 2022. Barrett seems to have an advantage in the polls over his Democratic rival, former state Sen. Curtis Hertel Jr., though two of the three publicly released polls of the race were internals from the Barrett campaign.\n\nIn the 8th District, former Trump administration official Paul Junge is locked in a close race with Democratic state Sen. Kristen McDonald Rivet to replace retiring Democratic Rep. Dan Kildee. Junge is a twice-failed candidate for Congress but has outraised McDonald Rivet. No matter who wins, it will be the first time in almost 50 years that a member of the Kildee family has not held Michigan\u2019s Flint-based district.\n\nFurther down the ballot, Democrats in the state legislature are hoping they can hold on to control of the state House of Representatives after winning the chamber by the narrowest of margins in 2022. As of August, Democratic state House candidates had outraised their Republican counterparts by about $4 million, giving them a massive cash advantage in a set of races that often fly under the radar. But Democrats are playing defense in more districts than the GOP is; Republicans only need to flip two seats to win control of the chamber and end the Democratic trifecta that has governed the state for the past two years.\n\nFootnotes\n\n*All numbers in this article are as of Oct. 3 at 2 p.m. Eastern.\n\n**Based on polls of likely and registered voters only (if a poll included results among both populations, we used likely voters).

        "text": "Tight race ahead of the US Presidential Election 2024: Current polls show who's ahead\u2014Harris or Trump?\nHarris Leads in National Polls\n\nBattleground States Show Tight Competition\n\nUnderstanding Poll Averages\n\nChallenges in Predicting Outcomes\n\n\n\n\n\n(You can now subscribe to our\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel\n\nVoters in the United States will go to the polls on November 5 to elect their next president. This election has taken an unexpected turn as President Joe Biden ended his campaign in July and endorsed Vice-President Kamala Harris . The pivotal question now is whether America will elect its first woman president or grant Donald Trump a second term.Since Harris entered the race at the end of July, she has been ahead of Trump in the national polling averages. Following a televised debate in Pennsylvania on September 10, which drew over 67 million viewers, Harris experienced a slight increase in her lead. Her advantage grew from 2.5 percentage points on the debate day to 3.3 points just over a week later. However, this boost was influenced by Trump's performance, as his average fell by half a percentage point during the same period.While these national polls are useful for gauging overall candidate popularity, they may not accurately predict election outcomes due to the U.S. electoral college system. This system allocates a total of 538 electoral college votes, with candidates needing 270 to win. Each state has a number of votes based on its population, but most states typically vote for the same party, meaning that only a few battleground states ultimately determine the election.Current polling indicates a tight race in seven states considered battlegrounds, with only one or two percentage points separating Harris and Trump. Pennsylvania is particularly important as it has the highest number of electoral votes among these states. On the day Biden withdrew from the race, he was trailing Trump by nearly five percentage points in these battleground states.Harris's polling position has shifted significantly since she became the Democratic nominee. According to polling averages, she has led in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin since early August. These states were Democratic strongholds before Trump turned them Republican in 2016. Biden won them back in 2020, and if Harris can do the same this year, she will be on course to secure the presidency.The polling figures referenced come from 538, a polling analysis website linked to ABC News . This site collects data from various polls conducted both nationally and in battleground states by multiple polling companies. To ensure quality, 538 only includes polls from firms that meet specific criteria, including transparency regarding sample sizes and methodologies.As the election approaches, the tight margins in swing states make it challenging to predict winners. Historical trends show that polls underestimated Trump's support in both the 2016 and 2020 elections. Polling companies are striving to improve their methods, making adjustments to better reflect the demographics of the voting population. However, accurately predicting who will turn out to vote on November 5 remains difficult.In summary, the upcoming election is shaping up to be a closely contested battle. As Harris and Trump prepare for the final stretch of campaigning, voters and analysts alike will closely watch the evolving dynamics in the polling data and battleground states, knowing that every vote could make a significant difference.",

        "text": "Poll: These issues are driving voters right now\nIn the closing weeks of the presidential campaign, voters are most likely to list the economy and preserving democracy as critical factors in their vote decisions, according to a new PBS News/NPR/Marist poll.\n\nNearly every voter is considering the state of the economy, the poll found. Ninety-five percent say it will be a factor for them in choosing how to cast their ballot, including 59 percent who say it is a deciding factor and 36 percent who say it is an important factor. About three-quarters of Republicans say it is a deciding factor, compared to 42 percent of Democrats and 61 percent of independents.\n\nEconomic indicators suggest the U.S. economy is stable, as inflation continues to subside and the chance of recession is low for now. In the most recent report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Consumer Price Index grew 2.5 percent year-over-year in August, which was a factor in the Federal Reserve decision last month to cut interest rates for the first time in four years.\n\nREAD MORE: This small sliver of late-deciders could swing the election\n\nYet a plurality of Americans (40 percent) in this poll say the economy is in poor condition. Another 28 percent say it is fair. Overall, fewer than a third of Americans say the economy is in good or excellent shape, suggesting Americans\u2019 personal financial situations continue to be a concern.\n\nWith so many voters focused on the economy, unhappiness on the issue should be a \u201ckey warning sign\u201d for the Harris campaign, said Republican strategist Kevin Madden, who was an adviser to Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 presidential campaign. The vice president should be worried about having enough time to turn around those perceptions, he added.\n\nWith so many voters focused on the economy, unhappiness on the issue should be a \u201ckey warning sign\u201d for the Harris campaign.\n\n\u201cDid those [economic] trend lines start to change or start to tick up where it\u2019s just slightly too late? Because most people\u2019s views about the economy are pretty dug in [from] probably three months ago,\u201d Madden said.\n\nThe economy is an issue Harris should be talking about more, including explaining how she will help people, Democratic strategist Faiz Shakir said. Trump was seen by a small majority of Americans as better equipped to handle the economy in last month\u2019s PBS News/NPR/Marist survey.\n\nTrump has tried to outflank Harris with a series of populist policy proposals, including eliminating taxes on tips, which both candidates have endorsed but experts say won\u2019t help workers significantly. Trump has also suggested social security benefits and overtime pay should be tax-exempt, though he admitted at a recent Pennsylvania campaign rally that he hated paying overtime as an employer and took steps to avoid it.\n\nTrump \u201ccan\u2019t be believed\u201d when he says he\u2019ll fight for working-class people because in his first term in the White House he did more to \u201ccater to powerful actors,\u201d Shakir said.\n\nNearly two-thirds of Americans also say preserving democracy is a deciding factor in their vote for president, including majorities of Democrats, Republicans and independents. Another quarter say it is an important factor.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Democratic and Republican candidates frame threats to democracy in sharply different terms. The Harris campaign has repeatedly criticized Trump for continuing to promote baseless claims that the 2020 presidential election, won by President Joe Biden, was rigged.\n\nDuring Tuesday\u2019s vice presidential debate, Democratic nominee Tim Walz asked his Republican opponent JD Vance whether Trump lost the last election and criticized the Ohio senator\u2019s \u201cdamning non-answer\u201d when Vance replied that he was \u201cfocused on the future.\u201d\n\nWATCH: Vance won\u2019t say Trump lost 2020 election. Walz says that\u2019s a \u2018damning non-answer\u2019\n\nTrump blamed the second assisination attempt on his life last month on Democrats who labeled him a threat to democracy. He has also turned around the attack on Biden and Harris. \u201cThey are the real threat,\u201d he said.\n\nImmigration remains a hot-button topic on the campaign trail and for registered voters in this poll, with 44 percent saying it will be a deciding factor in their vote. Another 43 percent say it is an important factor as they weigh their choices.\n\nBoth campaigns have put immigration front and center. Harris visited the U.S.-Mexico border for the first time in three years last Friday, as this poll was being conducted. Republicans have criticized the Biden administration for a surge in border crossings at the end of last year, but encounters have slowed significantly after the president signed an executive order in June placing new restrictions on asylum claims. Border Patrol recorded about 58,000 encounters between ports of entry on the southern border in August, a record one-month decline and one of the lowest levels since 2020.\n\nIn recent weeks, Trump and Vance have whipped up a political storm around Springfield, Ohio, by repeating false claims that Haitian immigrants were eating cats and dogs stolen from their neighbors. The influx of migrants, who the city says are there legally, has strained some resources in the city, but local Republican officials say there are no credible reports of pets being harmed. The attention has led to dozens of bomb threats.\n\nMany Haitian migrants are in the United States legally under temporary protected status, but Trump said in an interview Wednesday he would revoke their right to live in the U.S.\n\nREAD MORE: Why Americans are worried about voter fraud but have faith in their own elections\n\nIn the latest PBS News/NPR/Marist poll, 57 percent of U.S. adults say America\u2019s openness to people from the world is essential to the country\u2019s identity. Forty-one percent believe if America is too open to outsiders that it will lose its national identity. Democrats overwhelmingly (82 percent) support openness, while Republicans overwhelmingly (72 percent) worry about it.\n\nAbortion has been key to Democratic electoral victories since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade two years ago. With a month until Election Day, it is once again a key motivator. Sixty-two percent of Democrats say it is a deciding factor in their votes this year. The same is true for 44 percent of Americans overall, including a majority of women, a key part of the Harris coalition.\n\nRepublicans, who spent decades focused on overturning Roe, have shifted considerably on the issue. About a quarter of GOP voters say abortion is not a factor in their vote. Trump has previously claimed credit for appointing the conservative justices who overturned Roe, but in recent weeks has softened his rhetoric on the issue, telling people at a rally in Pennsylvania last week that women will \u201cno longer be thinking about abortion\u201d if he is elected.\n\nVivian Hoang contributed reporting.\n\nPBS News, NPR and Marist Poll conducted a survey on Sept. 27 through Oct. 1 that polled 1,628 U.S. adults with a margin of error of 3.3 percentage points, 1,514 registered voters with a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points, and 1,294 likely voters with a margin of error of 3.7 percentage points.",

        "text": "Former defense secretary Chuck Hagel talks presidential election, world politics at Kansas forum \u2022 Kansas Reflector\nLAWRENCE \u2014 Chuck Hagel, the 24th U.S. defense secretary and a former U.S. Senator from Nebraska, said Thursday the upcoming presidential election is going to be a defining one for foreign policy and politics at home.\n\nSpeaking at the University of Kansas Dole Institute of Politics in a forum on presidential candidates and their relationship to global politics, Hagel said the present day is the most dangerous era since World War II. The candidates, former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, aren\u2019t talking enough about the potential threat to America\u2019s place on the world stage, he said.\n\nHagel was among more than 100 signatories on a recent letter from former U.S. security officials endorsing Harris for president. Hagel said he searches for \u201cthree indispensable requisites\u201d in a leader: character, courage and judgment.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t agree with Harris on everything, but I think elections are always about choices,\u201d he told Jerry Seib, formerly of the Wall Street Journal and a visiting fellow at the Dole Institute, who moderated the Thursday event.\n\nHagel has disagreed with Trump\u2019s actions and words regarding the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or NATO, his stance on the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and the foreign policy and economic consequences of Trump\u2019s appetite for raising tariffs. However, he said Harris doesn\u2019t have a strong enough stance on Israel.\n\n\u201cThis election is going to define one hell of a lot,\u201d he said.\n\nThe future of foreign and domestic policy are at stake, and the president must have congressional support, he said. The war in Ukraine will be the \u201creal test\u201d of which direction American foreign policy is headed, he said.\n\n\u201cThis just can\u2019t go on indefinitely. So, I mean, how do you end it?\u201d Hagel asked. \u201cHow do you end it in a way that\u2019s honorable, that\u2019s right for the future for Ukraine but also for the future of the world?\u201d\n\nAs former President Barack Obama\u2019s defense secretary and as a two-term Republican U.S. Senator beginning in 1997, Hagel was often a critic of war, particularly the war in Iraq. He theorized Thursday the dangerous global climate facing the United States today is a product of failing to learn lessons from the past.\n\n\u201cWe should\u2019ve learned something from Vietnam,\u201d said Hagel, who served in the war in 1968. \u201cWe should\u2019ve learned some lessons from that but we didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nNow, narrower approaches to government, failed leadership and inadequate education systems have caused the United States to confront again the lessons learned in the 1930s, he said.\n\nIn the time since he was a government official, Hagel said, the Republican Party has become less \u201cexpansive\u201d in its thinking.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure there is a Republican Party anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s an amalgamation of tribes.\u201d\n\nHe said he is hopeful for bipartisanship, but \u201ca realist, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cDemocracies can only work if there is compromise,\u201d he said.",

        "text": "Election 2024 and immigration policy: Here\u2019s how employers can prepare for a change in administration\nWritten by Meredith W. Barnette, Esq., Partner.\n\nThe results of the 2024 election could have a long-lasting impact on the United States immigration system.\n\nThe race will pit current Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris against former Republican President Donald Trump, with election day set for Tuesday, November 5.\n\nThe two candidate have starkly different views on immigration, and with the impending change in administration, it is prudent for employers to proactively prepare their businesses, immigration programs, and employees, and begin taking action.\n\nSummary of Kamala Harris\u2019 immigration policies\n\nDemocratic nominee Kamala Harris currently serves as Vice President under current President Joe Biden. Overall, the Biden administration has been relatively positive for employment-based immigration and has demonstrated a more collaborative approach with business immigration attorneys and advocates in some areas.\n\nHarris and Vice-Presidential nominee Tim Walz (the current governor of Minnesota) are expected to continue the immigration policies of the current administration. Their campaign website reads:\n\n\u201cVice President Harris and Governor Walz believe in tough, smart solutions to secure the border, keep communities safe, and reform our broken immigration system. As Vice President, she supported the bipartisan border security bill, the strongest reform in decades. \u2026 As President, she will bring back the bipartisan border security bill and sign it into law. At the same time, she knows that our immigration system is broken and needs comprehensive reform that includes strong border security and an earned pathway to citizenship.\u201d\n\nSome of the immigration policies implemented by the current administration include:\n\n\u201cKeeping Families Together\u201d initiative\n\nIn addition to the \u201cearned pathway to citizenship\u201d mentioned on her campaign website, Harris will likely continue to advocate for and attempt to implement the \u201cKeeping Families Together\u201d initiative, which was introduced by President Joe Biden this summer.\n\nThat policy allows certain undocumented individuals who are married to U.S. citizens, as well as their children, to apply for legal permanent residency via \u201cParole in Place,\u201d provided they meet all eligibility criteria. The program began accepting applications in mid-August but was quickly blocked by the courts.\n\nAs of the publication of this white paper, USCIS could continue to accept applications for the program from applicable foreign nationals yet was blocked from adjudicating those petitions.\n\nReduced requests for evidence and denials; General increase in cooperation\n\nRequests for evidence (RFEs), Notices of Intent to Deny (NOID), and overall denials increased during the first Trump administration. Those numbers, however, have noticeably decreased during the Biden administration from 2021 to the present. Immigration attorneys and advocates are hopeful that this trend will continue in a Harris administration.\n\nOn a similar note, overall cooperation between The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), as well as USCIS, and employment-based immigration attorneys and advocates has seemed to increase under President Biden.\n\nUSCIS director Ur M. Jaddou as well as other agency officials have attended American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA) meetings and conferences during her tenure, while some of the Biden administration\u2019s policies have been finalized after receiving input from relevant immigration counsel and advocates. This is another trend that may continue if Harris is elected President.\n\nOnline filings\n\nUSCIS has allowed for online filings of several immigration forms, including the Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker for specific nonimmigrant visa types, during the Biden administration. Although there have been some minor tech-related issues, online filings as a whole have streamlined processes and generally made it easier to apply for immigration benefits, with the expectation that online filings will continue to expand to other visa types and forms.\n\nIt is likely that very few, if any, new forms will move to online filings under a second Trump administration, and it is even possible they could do away with online filing all together.\n\nH-1B registration changes\n\nThe Biden administration made some significant changes to the H-1B registration process and lottery during their time in office, and it is reasonable to assume those adjustments would remain in place if Kamala Harris is victorious in the 2024 election.\n\nOne such change was issuing a final rule related to the H-1B registration process which took effect for FY2025 and specified that each cap-subject beneficiary was only registered for the lottery once, regardless of how many registrations were submitted in their name. The change ensured that each beneficiary had the same odds of selection and prevented organizations from misusing the registration system by filing multiple registrations for a single beneficiary.\n\nFurther, the rule allowed USCIS the ability to deny or revoke H-1B petitions where the \u201cunderlying registration contained a false attestation or was otherwise invalid.\u201d Under the new rule, USCIS can also rescind or reject an H-1B petition if it finds the registration fee was \u201cdeclined, not reconciled, disputed or otherwise invalid.\u201d\n\nThe new rule also permitted some filings \u201cwith requested start dates that are after Oct. 1 of the relevant fiscal year, consistent with current policy.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear if USCIS would continue to pursue publication of an additional rule on the H-1B registration process under a Harris administration.\n\nFurther, USCIS debuted \u201corganizational accounts\u201d for FY2025 H-1B cap filings, as well as cap-exempt H-1B petitions. Under the organizational accounts, multiple members of an organization, including both business and legal representatives, can work together inside the organizational account portal to complete the H-1B registration; the Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker and the associated Form I-907, Request for Premium Processing Service. The H-1B petitions and the premium processing request can be filed online via the organizational account.\n\nThe introduction of organizational accounts was praised by employment-based immigration advocates, as it offered a major improvement for collaboration between employers and their legal representatives. The Harris administration is expected to leave that program in place if they are elected.\n\nAsylum policies\n\nBiden implemented a policy in the summer of 2024 which restricted access to foreign nationals who were seeking asylum on the southern border. Specifically, that policy, issued through a proclamation, made it so foreign nationals would \u201cgenerally be ineligible for asylum, absent exceptionally compelling circumstances\u201d if they \u201ccross the southern border unlawfully or without authorization.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese measures are in effect until 14 calendar days after there has been a 7-consecutive-calendar-day average of less than 1,500 encounters between the ports of entry,\u201d a fact sheet about the proclamation from the DHS read. \u201cThe measures would again go into effect, or continue, as appropriate, when there has been a 7-consecutive-calendar-day average of 2,500 encounters or more.\u201d\n\nMany immigration advocates criticized the measure, including the American Immigration Lawyers Association.\n\nBiden also put in place a number of other rules, regulations and policies related to immigration at the border. Harris said in late September she would continue to enforce these policies if she was to become President, and would make some even more stringent than when they were first introduced by Biden.\n\nSummary of Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policies\n\nRepublican nominee Donald Trump previously served as President of the United States from January 2017 to January 2021. Trump\u2019s policies during his time in office generally restricted entry to the United States and led to increased scrutiny of applications across the spectrum of employment, family, and humanitarian based immigration petitions. The restrictions and increased scrutiny generally resulted in delays in receiving work authorization, and an uptick in denials of certain case types.\n\nTrump has indicated during the run-up to the 2024 election he will take up similar stances, and will likely implement the same, or similar, policies related to immigration if he was to win a second tenure. Some of those policies included:\n\nBuy American, Hire American\n\nThe Buy American Hire American (BAHA) executive order was signed by Trump early in his initial term in the White House. The goal of the policy aimed to \u201ccreate higher wages\u201d and employment rates for U.S. workers and protect their economic interests \u201cby rigorously enforcing and administering immigration laws.\u201d\n\nBAHA also directed the Department of Homeland Security, in coordination with other agencies, \u201cto advance policies to help ensure H-1B visas (were) awarded to the most-skilled or highest-paid beneficiaries.\u201d\n\nMany analysts believed BAHA stifled global mobility and access to talent. Employers certainly felt the effects of the executive order during the four years Trump was in office. BAHA resulted in an increase in Requests for Evidence (RFE) issued after filing a petition with USCIS; an increase in petition denials, especially for H-1B and L-1 visa petitions; and excessive delays in case adjudications.\n\nPresident Joe Biden revoked the BAHA executive order shortly after he took office in January 2021. Trump could look to put Buy American Hire American back in place or sign a similar executive order if he is elected in 2024.\n\nPublic charge rule\n\nUnder the Trump administration, the Department of Homeland Security put into place a much more extensive and detrimental interpretation of the \u201cpublic charge\u201d rule, which took effect near the end of their time in the White House. The rule required visa and green card applicants to show they would not become a public charge in the U.S. and generally required all applicants, including employment-based applicants, to provide extensive documentation proving this (tax returns, bank statements, pay statements, insurance benefits, mortgage documents, etc).\n\nMultiple federal judges originally blocked the rule in late 2019, but the Supreme Court lifted those temporary injunctions while those legal challenges continued. USCIS then implemented the extensive regulations for determining whether a foreign national would be deemed inadmissible to the U.S. based upon the likelihood of becoming a public charge at any time in the future.\n\nThe Biden administration vacated the Trump interpretation of the \u201cpublic charge\u201d rule in March 2021 and reverted back to applying the statute consistent with the 1999 Interim Field Guidance, a much less strict interpretation of the regulation which has not required such burdensome documentation.\n\nDACA\n\nTrump attempted to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program in the first year he was in office during his initial term.\n\nSince then, the DACA program has been impacted by various court rulings. As of the time of this white paper\u2019s publication, applications from those already in the program can continue to be adjudicated by USCIS. However, because of the ongoing court rulings, the Biden administration has not been able to process initial applications for DACA since July 2021.\n\nIt is reasonable to expect that Trump could attempt to end the program in its entirety again, and likely would not defend it in court against other potential legal challenges.\n\nTravel bans\n\nOne of the signature policies of Trump\u2019s initial administration was the implementation of a travel ban in 2017.\n\nThe measure was officially implemented as the Presidential Proclamation entitled \u201cEnhancing Vetting Capabilities and Processes for Detecting Attempted Entry Into the United States by Terrorists or Other Public-Safety Threats\u201d and included 13 countries by the end of Trump\u2019s time in the White House.\n\nBiden overturned that Presidential Proclamation from Trump on January 20, 2021, his first day in office. Trump could reinstate that proclamation, or sign something similar, if he takes office again in 2025. If so, it is expected that foreign nationals will either experience significant delays or bars from entering the United States.\n\nHow employers can prepare before and after election\n\nEither change in administration has the potential to impact employers and their employees. Employers should consider taking the below actions in order to prepare for a change in administration in late January 2025.\n\n\u2014 Initiate green card filings as soon as possible for as many applicable employees as practicable by the end of the year, especially those who may be eligible for the National Interest Waiver (NIW), or another similar immigrant or nonimmigrant visa type. The Biden administration introduced new guidance related to NIWs in 2023, which opened the door for green card options for many STEM graduates. Under a new administration, this guidance could be reversed or tightened, eliminating a pathway to permanent residence, and ultimately citizenship, for qualified foreign nationals.\n\n\u2014 Use premium processing whenever possible for all immigrant and nonimmigrant forms and applications that are eligible so that a decision is received on the case as soon as possible. This may avoid some anticipated case challenges if the Trump administration is elected, such as prolonged delays in adjudication, a more likely chance of an RFE and/or an increased rate of outright denials.\n\n\u2014 Identify any and all employees who are currently located in countries that could be impacted if a new travel ban takes effect and attempt to bring them to the United States. Employers should also prepare a travel advisory for all employees on visas in the company, warning against travel to those countries in case a ban is issued while they are abroad.\n\n\u2014 Update the company\u2019s protocols for site visits from the Fraud Detection and National Security Directorate (FDNS) and prepare employees and leadership teams about the best way to handle these visits if they happen. It is expected that, under a Trump administration, these site visits will significantly increase again, as they did under his previous administration.\n\n\u2014 Audit I-9 compliance programs and ensure all Form I-9 records are accurate and compliant with federal immigration law. For the same reason mentioned above, it is expected that a Trump administration will result in an increase in I-9 audits and enforcement penalties.\n\n\u2014 Reevaluate company positions and immigration petitions and comply as much as possible with \u201cBuy American Hire American,\u201d in case it is implemented again.\n\n\u2014 Develop a business plan for any and all international relocations, ideally by the end of 2024. A clear communications plan should also be established so that information can be distributed to applicable foreign nationals if policy changes occur with little notice. If Trump is elected, it is anticipated that there will be increased scrutiny on applications; visa delays and denials; and travel bans that would all impact employers\u2019 ability to transfer and relocate employees to the U.S.\n\n\u2014 Brief managers and other leadership groups about the impending change in administration, its potential impact on mobility, and the importance of developing backup and/or contingency workforce plans.\n\n\u2014 Analyze current policies about employee relocation because of gaps in employment authorization that may occur if there are timing issues, backlogs or denials by/at/from USCIS (for example, if an employee must depart the U.S. while awaiting a decision on a benefit from USCIS, it may benefit the company if its policy allows the employee to temporarily work abroad). Non-U.S. work site locations for top talent should also be evaluated, with serious consideration given to the risk tolerance for relying on digital nomad visas.\n\n\u2014 Revisit vendor resource management (third party contractors) and any potential support that could be offered for their foreign nationals in need of visa sponsorship.",

        "text": "US election 2024: When is the US presidential election? Who is in the race?\nA simple guide to the US presidential election to be held on 5 November 2024 read more\n\nDemocratic presidential nominee and US Vice President Kamala Harris, speaks during a presidential debate hosted by ABC as Republican presidential nominee, and former US President Donald Trump, listens, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on September 10. Reuters\n\nAll eyes are on the United States, as it heads to polls in November. Americans will be voting not only for the president but also for members of Congress, who play a pivotal role in passing laws that impact everyday life.\n\nHere are the most frequently asked questions on the US election.\n\nWhen is the US presidential election?\n\nThe 2024 US presidential election will be held on 5 November, Tuesday. Election Day is traditionally held on the Tuesday following the first Monday in November.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe election winner will serve a four-year term, starting January 2025.\n\nWho are the candidates in the fray?\n\nThe presidential race has boiled down to two candidates from the country\u2019s two big parties \u2013 the Republican Party and the Democratic Party.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump was picked as the official Republican nominee at a party convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He will be up against US Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nHarris was picked as the Democratic nominee after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race following a disastrous debate against Trump.\n\nRepublican presidential nominee and former US President Donald Trump watches a video showing Kamala Harris during a campaign rally in Erie, Pennsylvania on 29 September. Reuters\n\nThere were some independent candidates in the race. The most prominent among them was Robert F Kennedy Jr, nephew of former president John F Kennedy. However, he suspended his campaign in August and has now backed Trump.\n\nTrump chose Ohio Senator JD Vance to be his running mate, while Harris went with Minnesota Governor Tim Walz.\n\nWho else will be elected in November?\n\nWhile the big focus is the race to the White House, voters will also pick new members of the US Congress.\n\nCongress comprises the House of Representatives and the Senate.\n\nAll 435 spots in the House of Representatives and 34 Senate seats are up for grabs. In the House, members serve a two-year term. Republicans currently have the majority, and Harris\u2019s Democrats will be hoping for a turnaround.\n\nThe dome of the US Capitol building is seen in Washington, on September 26. Reuters\n\nIn the Senate, 34 seats out of 100 are available, for a six-year term. Republicans are hoping to overturn the narrow Democratic majority.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe House of Representatives and the Senate pass laws.\n\nHow does the US presidential election work?\n\nThe electoral college, the indirect system of universal suffrage, governs presidential elections in the United States. Each state has a different number of electors \u2013 calculated by adding the number of their elected representatives in the House, which varies according to population, to the number of senators (two per state).\n\nRural Vermont, for example, has just three electoral votes. Giant California has 54.\n\nThere are 538 electors in total scattered across the 50 states and the District of Columbia. To take the White House, a candidate must win 270 votes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTourists are kept back by new security fencing installed ahead of the upcoming presidential election in front of the White House in Washington, on October 2. Reuters\n\nThe candidates have to win in contests across the 50 states. The candidate which wins the highest number of votes is awarded all of the state\u2019s electoral college votes.\n\nMost states lean towards a particular party \u2013 either Republican or Democratic. Hence, there is a lot of focus on states which switch sides. These are known as swing states and they play a big role in determining the election result.\n\nCandidates who win the most votes need not win the race always. In 2016, Hillary Clinton bagged the most votes but was defeated by the electoral college.\n\nHow many people will vote in the election?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe number of Americans who will be eligible to vote in 2024 stands at 224 million, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. It remains to be seen how many cast their ballot.\n\nAccording to Pew Research Centre, midterm elections of 2018 and 2022, and the presidential vote of 2020, produced three of the highest turnouts of their kind seen in the US in decades. \u201cAbout two-thirds (66 per cent) of the voting-eligible population turned out for the 2020 presidential election \u2013 the highest rate for any national election since 1900,\u201d Pew says on its website. That translated to nearly 155 million voters, according to the Census Bureau.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n224 million voters are eligible to vote in the US election. File photo/AP\n\nHow are votes counted? When will the results be declared?\n\nThe US does not have a federal counting process. The states count the votes and it can take weeks until the official tally is released.\n\nHowever, a presidential winner usually emerges on the night of the election.\n\nUS media has developed complex methodologies to estimate if a candidate is winning and they usually \u201ccall\u201d the election before the official process is complete.\n\nIn 2020, it took a few days to count votes.\n\nWhen does the new president take charge?\n\nAfter the election, the transition begins. During this time, the new administration appoints Cabinet ministers and plans for the term.\n\nThe president is sworn into office in January. The ceremony is called inauguration and is held on the steps of the Capitol building in Washington DC.\n\nWith inputs from agencies",

        "text": "Hurricane pushes climate change to forefront of presidential campaign\nThe devastation wrought by Hurricane Helene has brought climate change to the forefront of the presidential campaign after the issue lingered on the margins for months.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris traveled to Georgia Wednesday to see hard-hit areas, two days after her Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump, was in the state and criticized the federal response to the storm, which has killed at least 200 people in the Southeast. Helene is the deadliest storm to hit the U.S. mainland since Hurricane Katrina in 2005.\n\nPresident Joe Biden toured some of the hardest-hit areas by helicopter on Wednesday and Thursday. Biden, who has frequently been called on to survey damage and console victims after tornadoes, wildfires, tropical storms and other natural disasters, traveled to the Carolinas, Florida and Georgia to get a closer look at the hurricane devastation.\n\n\"Storms are getting stronger and stronger,\" Biden said Wednesday after surveying damage near Asheville, North Carolina. At least 70 people died in the state.\n\n\"Nobody can deny the impact of the climate crisis anymore,'' Biden said at a briefing in Raleigh, North Carolina. \"They must be brain dead if they do.\"\n\nHarris, meanwhile, hugged and huddled with a family Wednesday in hurricane-ravaged Augusta, Georgia.\n\n\"There is real pain and trauma that resulted because of this hurricane'' and its aftermath, Harris said outside a storm-damaged house with downed trees in the yard.\n\n\"We are here for the long-haul,'' she said.\n\nStorm damage forces discussion\n\nThe focus on the storm \u2014 and its link to climate change \u2014 was notable after climate change was only lightly mentioned in two presidential debates this year. The candidates instead focused on abortion rights, the economy, immigration and other issues.\n\nThe hurricane featured prominently in Tuesday's vice-presidential debate as Republican JD Vance and Democrat Tim Walz were asked about the storm and the larger issue of climate change.\n\nBoth men called the hurricane a tragedy and agreed on the need for a strong federal response. But it was Walz, the governor of Minnesota, who put the storm in the context of a warming climate.\n\n\"There's no doubt this thing roared onto the scene faster and stronger than anything we've seen,\" he said.\n\nBob Henson, a meteorologist and writer with Yale Climate Connections, said it was no surprise that Helene is pushing both the federal disaster response and human-caused climate change into the campaign conversation.\n\n\"Weather disasters are often overlooked as a factor in big elections,'' he said. \"Helene is a sprawling catastrophe, affecting millions of Americans. And it dovetails with several well-established links between hurricanes and climate change, including rapid intensification and intensified downpours.\"\n\nMore than 40 trillion gallons of rain drenched the Southeast in the last week, an amount that if concentrated in North Carolina would cover the state in 3 1/2 feet of water. \"That's an astronomical amount of precipitation,\" said Ed Clark, head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Water Center in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.\n\nCandidates make claims, counter claims\n\nDuring Tuesday's debate, Walz credited Vance for past statements acknowledging that climate change is a problem. But he noted that Trump has called climate change \"a hoax\" and joked that rising seas \"would make more beachfront property to be able to invest in.\"\n\nTrump said in a speech Tuesday that \"the planet has actually gotten little bit cooler recently,\" adding: \"Climate change covers everything.\"\n\nIn fact, summer 2024 sweltered to Earth's hottest on record, making it likely this year will end up as the warmest humanity has measured, according to the European climate service Copernicus. Global records were shattered just last year as human-caused climate change, with a temporary boost from an El Ni\u00f1o, keeps dialing up temperatures and extreme weather, scientists said.\n\nVance, an Ohio senator, said he and Trump support clean air, clean water and \"want the environment to be cleaner and safer.\" However, during Trump's four years in office, he took a series of actions to roll back more than 100 environmental regulations.\n\nVance sidestepped a question about whether he agrees with Trump's statement that climate change is a hoax. \"What the president has said is that if the Democrats \u2014 in particular Kamala Harris and her leadership \u2014 really believe that climate change is serious, what they would be doing is more manufacturing and more energy production in the United States of America. And that's not what they're doing,\" he said.\n\n\"This idea that carbon [dioxide] emissions drives all of the climate change. Well, let's just say that's true just for the sake of argument. So, we're not arguing about weird science. If you believe that, what would you want to do?\" Vance asked.\n\nThe answer, he said, is to \"produce as much energy as possible in the United States of America, because we're the cleanest economy in the entire world.''\n\nVance claimed that policies by Biden and Harris actually help China, because many solar panels, lithium-ion batteries and other materials used in renewable energy and electric vehicles are made in China and imported to the United States.\n\nWalz rebutted that claim, noting that the Inflation Reduction Act, the Democrats' signature climate law approved in 2022, includes the largest-ever investment in domestic clean energy production. The law, for which Harris cast the deciding vote, has created 200,000 jobs across the country, including in Ohio and Minnesota, Walz said. Vance was not in the Senate when the law was approved.\n\n\"We are producing more natural gas and more oil [in the United States] than we ever have,\" Walz said. \"We're also producing more clean energy.\"\n\nThe comment echoed a remark by Harris in last month's presidential debate. The Biden-Harris administration has overseen \"the largest increase in domestic oil production in history because of an approach that recognizes that we cannot over rely on foreign oil,\" Harris said then.\n\nWhile Biden rarely mentions it, domestic fossil fuel production under his administration is at an all-time high. Crude oil production averaged 12.9 million barrels a day last year, eclipsing a previous record set in 2019 under Trump, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n\nDemocrats want to continue investments in renewable energy such as wind and solar power \u2014 and not just because supporters of the Green New Deal want that, Walz said.\n\n\"My farmers know climate change is real. They've seen 500-year droughts, 500-year floods back-to-back. But what they're doing is adapting,'' he said.\n\n\"The solution for us is to continue to move forward, [accept] that climate change is real\" and reduce reliance on fossil fuels, Walz said, adding that the administration is doing exactly that.\n\n\"We are seeing us becoming an energy superpower for the future, not just the current'' time, he said.",

The pair tore into former President Donald J. Trump for his role in igniting a riot at the Capitol, and they warned of the threat he poses .",
        "text": "Liz Cheney Blasts Trump Over Jan. 6 as She Stumps With Harris: Oct. 3 Campaign News\nThe former congresswoman and Republican exile campaigned with the vice president in the battleground state of Wisconsin.\n\nI tell you, I have never voted for a Democrat. But this year I am proudly casting my vote for Vice President Kamala Harris. I know that she will be a president who will defend the rule of law. And I know that she will be a president who can inspire all of our children and, if I might say so, especially our little girls. We have a shared commitment, a shared commitment as Americans to ensuring that future generations live in a nation where power is transferred peacefully, where our leaders are men and women of good faith, and where our public servants set aside partisan battles to do what\u2019s right for this country.\n\nIt was an exercise in unsubtle and unlikely campaign optics: a Democratic vice president who is running for the presidency. A Republican former congresswoman who is the daughter of a staunchly conservative vice president. A small city known as the birthplace of the Republican Party in the middle of a battleground state.\n\nOn Thursday, Vice President Kamala Harris and former Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the most prominent Republican to endorse her campaign, traveled to Ripon in central Wisconsin where meetings in 1854 helped form the Republican Party. Just a mile away from a one-room schoolhouse where those gatherings were held, the pair tore into former President Donald J. Trump for his role in igniting a riot at the Capitol, and they warned of the threat he poses to democracy should he return to power.\n\nMs. Cheney said that, in November, putting patriotism ahead of partisanship should not merely be an aspiration \u2014 \u201cit is our duty.\u201d\n\nHer remarks, delivered with an air of somber restraint, were as much a public indictment of Mr. Trump as they were an endorsement of Ms. Harris. Calling his candidacy \u201ca threat unlike any we have faced before,\u201d she called on conservatives to join her in an \u201curgent cause\u201d to elect Ms. Harris and to reject what she called the former president\u2019s \u201cdepraved cruelty.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know that she will be a president who will defend the rule of law,\u201d Ms. Cheney said of Ms. Harris, \u201cand I know that she will be a president who can inspire all of our children and, if I might say so, especially our little girls.\u201d\n\nThe joint appearance was one of the starkest examples to date of how Ms. Harris has endeavored to pitch herself as a unifying president who values pragmatism over partisanship. Her overarching goal is to win over moderate and independent voters who will be crucial to delivering her a decisive victory.\n\nThe event took place at Ripon College, where hundreds of people gathered on a lawn near the campus\u2019s main building, which was adorned with American flags and posters that read: \u201cCountry over party.\u201d At several points in the program, the crowd cheered, \u201cThank you, Liz\u201d and \u201cKa-ma-la.\u201d\n\nImage Ms. Harris said that while she and Ms. Cheney might not agree on much, they shared a love of country and democratic ideals. Credit... Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times\n\nBoth women spoke about the significance of the site where the Republican Party\u2019s founding leaders first met, bonding over their opposition to slavery. \u201cLiz Cheney stands in the finest traditions of its leaders,\u201d Ms. Harris said.\n\nThe vice president said that Ms. Cheney\u2019s endorsement held \u201cspecial significance,\u201d and that while the two politicians might not agree on much, they shared a love of country and democratic ideals. Repeating her promise to be a president for all Americans regardless of party, Ms. Harris said she had sworn an oath to uphold the Constitution six times in her career.\n\n\u201cThe president of the United States must not look at our country through the narrow lens of ideology or petty partisanship or self-interest,\u201d Ms. Harris said. \u201cThe president of the United States must not look at our country as an instrument for their own ambitions. Our nation is not some spoil to be won. The United States of America is the greatest idea humanity ever devised.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cAnd so, in the face of those who would endanger our magnificent experiment, people of every party must stand together.\u201d\n\nMs. Harris\u2019s campaign has used Ms. Cheney\u2019s endorsement, and those of a stream of other Republicans, in assailing Mr. Trump as a threat to the republic, and in blunting accusations by his campaign that the vice president is a \u201cradical liberal.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump responded in the early hours of Friday, writing on his social media site that Ms. Cheney was a \u201clow IQ War Hawk\u201d and that she and Ms. Harris were \u201ca pathetic couple\u201d who were \u201csuffering gravely from Trump Derangement Syndrome.\u201d\n\nSteven Cheung, a Trump campaign spokesman, blasted the records of both women afterward. \u201cThe both of them are made for each other \u2014 proponents of endless wars, killers of Social Security, and enemies of American workers,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nMs. Harris\u2019s campaign has sought to recast her political image as a left-leaning Californian by downplaying or abandoning some of the progressive positions she held when she first ran for president in the 2020 race. During this campaign, she has branded herself a \u201cpragmatist\u201d and a \u201ccapitalist,\u201d and has spoken more openly about issues that appeal to the conservative base, like gun ownership. She has also suggested that she would appoint a Republican to her cabinet, if elected.\n\nIn a presidential race that may be won by razor-thin margins in November, Wisconsin appears to be a near tossup between Ms. Harris and Mr. Trump. President Biden won the state by only 20,600 votes in 2020, and a recent poll by The New York Times and Siena College showed Ms. Harris with 49 percent support among likely voters, versus Mr. Trump at 47 percent.\n\nImage Ms. Cheney once called Ms. Harris\u2019s voting record in the Senate \u201cto the left of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.\u201d She added, \u201cIt\u2019s very clear, she is a radical liberal.\u201d They are now allied in trying to defeat Mr. Trump. Credit... Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times\n\nMs. Harris\u2019s decision to appear alongside Ms. Cheney, a Wisconsin native, signals that her campaign is hoping to appeal to Republican voters who have been repelled by Mr. Trump\u2019s style of politics. The two women agree on little politically beyond their distaste for Mr. Trump. They had next to no relationship when they overlapped in Congress, though they did speak on the phone about Ms. Cheney\u2019s decision to endorse the vice president.\n\nMs. Cheney was a onetime critic of Ms. Harris. In an August 2020 interview on Fox News, shortly after Mr. Biden chose her as his running mate, Ms. Cheney called Ms. Harris \u2019s voting record in the Senate \u201cto the left of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.\u201d She added, \u201cIt\u2019s very clear, she is a radical liberal.\u201d\n\nBut after the Capitol attack, Ms. Cheney set partisan labels aside. She became the top Republican on the House committee that investigated Mr. Trump\u2019s role in the riot. Suddenly an outcast in her party, she later lost her seat to a Trump-backed challenger.\n\nMs. Cheney\u2019s appearance for Ms. Harris on Thursday was also striking because of the timing: On Wednesday, a 165-page brief from the special counsel, Jack Smith, laid out new evidence of how Mr. Trump tried to remain in power despite losing the 2020 election.\n\nDuring her speech, Ms. Cheney brought up the fresh details, including Mr. Trump\u2019s apparent nonchalance when he was implored to ensure the safety of his vice president, Mike Pence, whom rioters had threatened to hang on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\n\u201cSo what?\u201d the former president said, according to the brief.\n\nMs. Cheney told the crowd, \u201cWe have a responsibility, all of us, to remind people that our institutions don\u2019t defend themselves.\u201d She added, \u201cWe the people defend our institutions.\u201d\n\nCalling Mr. Trump \u201cvindictive,\u201d Ms. Cheney said \u201cany person who would do these things can never be trusted with power.\u201d\n\nMs. Cheney first said she planned to vote for Ms. Harris at a conference last month in North Carolina. It was a major step in a long turnabout for a staunchly conservative former lawmaker, who is pro-gun, anti-abortion and hawkish on national security issues.\n\nDays later, her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, said that he would also vote for Ms. Harris.\n\nOn Thursday, Ms. Cheney made clear that she had not strayed from her traditional, Republican bona fides. Her campaign work started at age 10, she said, when she helped seal envelopes for President Gerald Ford\u2019s re-election campaign. She cast her first vote for a presidential race in 1984, she went on, and referred to herself as a Reagan Republican.\n\n\u201cI was a Republican even before Donald Trump started spray-tanning,\u201d she jabbed.\n\nMr. Trump, for his part, held a rally on Thursday in Michigan, where Ms. Harris will campaign on Friday. During his speech, he continued to claim that he won the 2020 election.\n\nNicholas Nehamas and Reid J. Epstein contributed reporting from Washington.",

The six-part series is intended to drive voters across the country to trusted sources for information specific to their community, such as their state and local election officials.\n\nEach video in the series is about two-minutes long and is designed to allow election officials, civic organizations, and others to share them with their communities. Topics include: registering to vote, making a plan to vote, voting by mail, voting in person, trusted sources of information, and election results. The EAC is creating 30-second versions of each video to make it even easier to capture the attention of voters, which will also be available on the EAC\u2019s YouTube channel.\n\nWith voter registration deadlines in some states fast approaching, the first video in the \u201cBe Election Ready\u201d video series provides timely and understandable information on the voter registration process and different methods available for registration. During the last presidential election, more than 209 million people were active registered voters according to the 2020 U.S. Election Administration and Voting Survey (EAVS). The 30-second version for Registering to Vote is available now.\n\nThe EAC recently partnered with the American Psychological Association on a different video series to support election officials devoted to managing workplace stress. It includes two videos\u2014one is focused on understanding, recognizing, and managing stress in the workplace and the second is designed for use in poll worker training classes. Both are featured on the EAC\u2019s YouTube channel.\n\nVoters can find registration information at vote.gov, and state-specific options to register and cast a ballot at eac.gov/vote.\n\n###\n\nThe U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) was established by the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA). It is an independent, bipartisan commission charged with ensuring secure, accurate, and accessible elections by developing guidance to meet HAVA requirements, adopting voluntary voting system guidelines, and serving as a national clearinghouse of information on election administration. The EAC also accredits testing laboratories and certifies voting systems, as well as administers the use of HAVA funds. For more information, visit www.eac.gov.",

        "text": "What is the Electoral College? What to know, in 500 words\nIn the US, presidential elections are decided by a state-based vote allocation system. Here\u2019s what you need to know.\n\nIt\u2019s at the heart of how presidential elections in the United States are decided. But for many, the Electoral College is a mystery, wrapped in a riddle, shrouded in an enigma.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be confusing, though.\n\nTo understand the Electoral College system, you first have to know that US presidents are not elected by the national popular vote: the total number of votes each candidate receives.\n\nInstead, a group of 538 so-called \u201celectors\u201d select the president. These electors make up the Electoral College.\n\nSo who are these electors?\n\nBefore the election, the political parties in each state choose a slate of electors: real people who ultimately cast a vote for the president. Very often, the electors are party officials or supporters.\n\nEach state gets the same number of electors as it has representatives in the US House of Representatives and the US Senate.\n\nFor example, Michigan gets 15 Electoral College votes. That corresponds to the two senators and 13 House members that represent the state in Congress.\n\nNow that we know who these electors are and how many represent each state, how are their votes allocated? Here\u2019s where it gets fun.\n\nIn nearly all the states across the US, the presidential candidate who gets the most votes wins all that state\u2019s electors: It\u2019s a winner-takes-all system. Even if a candidate wins a state narrowly, they still get all the electors.\n\nThe outliers are Maine and Nebraska, which allocate their electors based on a more complicated system that reflects the popular vote on the state and congressional district levels.\n\nThe District of Columbia \u2014 which is not a state but encompasses the country\u2019s capital \u2014 also gets three Electoral College votes.\n\nBut here is the most important part: To win the White House, a presidential candidate must win the support of a majority of the electors.\n\nSo out of a total of 538 Electoral College votes, they need at least 270 to win.\n\nThe electors ultimately cast their votes in December, about a month after the election.\n\nTheir votes are then certified by Congress in early January, when the president is confirmed and takes office.\n\nSo what does this all mean?\n\nEffectively, to win the US presidency, a candidate has to win support in enough key states to reach that magic Electoral College number of 270.\n\nUnder this system, a candidate who wins the popular vote \u2014 the most votes in total across the US \u2014 may not actually win the White House.\n\nOne recent example came in 2016, when Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton won the popular vote but lost the election to Republican Donald Trump. His victory was buoyed by wins in states like Florida and Pennsylvania, each of which offered at least 20 Electoral College votes.\n\nThe Electoral College system was designed, in effect, to ensure the political power of the states.\n\nSome Americans say the Electoral College should be scrapped in favour of the popular vote. Others argue the system ensures highly populated states do not overshadow smaller ones, thereby encouraging minority representation in US democracy.",

        "text": "October 5, 2024, presidential campaign news\nVice President Kamala Harris speaks to supporters at the Redford Fire Department on October 4, in Redford, Michigan. Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images\n\nFormer President Donald Trump should be running away with this election given how few people think the country is heading in the right direction.\n\nInstead, Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are neck and neck in the polls. Now, it\u2019s not clear whether Harris can continue to win over so many voters who think we\u2019re heading in the wrong direction. What is clear is that Harris would need to defy certain fundamentals if she wants to win next month, and recent history suggests she has a shot.\n\nWhen I speak of fundamentals, I mean questions beyond the horse race, like asking Americans whether they think the country is on the right track.\n\nA minority of Americans have historically said the country is heading in the right direction, but it\u2019s usually not as bad as the current figures. Only about 28% of Americans believe the country is on the right track these days, according to the latest NBC News poll. That\u2019s well below where things were when Joe Biden took office in 2021, when that percentage was well north of 40%.\n\nIndeed, 28% is not where a president\u2019s party wants to be a month before the election \u2014 whether the incumbent is running or not. Since 1980, in elections won by the incumbent\u2019s party, an average of 42% of Americans have said the country was on the right track.\n\nWe see something similarly troubling for Harris on another fundamental \u2014 presidential approval ratings.\n\nThe incumbent\u2019s party has never won when the president had higher disapproval ratings than approval ratings. Biden\u2019s disapproval rating is about 10 points above his approval rating.\n\nRead more here.",

In the middle of a heated exchange on immigration, Vance and Walz started talking over each other. CBS News\u2019 Margaret Brennan, one of the two debate moderators, tried to regain control several times.\n\nThen she said, \u201cThe audience can\u2019t hear you because your mics are cut,\u201d as the candidates could be faintly heard talking in the background. Ahead of the debate, CBS News said it reserved the right to turn off the candidates\u2019 mics during the showdown.\n\nA clip of the moment was posted on CBS\u2019 TikTok account \u2014 drawing more than 3 million views and more than 319,000 likes.

The cold open featured Maya Rudolph as Kamala Harris, Jim Gaffigan as Tim Walz, Andy Samberg as Doug Emhoff and James Austin Johnson as Donald Trump, among others.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump is stuck in the past. But it\u2019s like what I say to my husband, Doug, when he leaves his phone at the Chilis: We are not going back,\u201d Rudolph said as she impersonated Harris.

Comedian Allison Reese, who is no stranger to viral fame for her Harris impressions, got more than 174,000 likes and 1.2 million views for a TikTok of her Harris persona reacting to the vice presidential debate. On the other side of the impression ticket, comedian Austin Nasso, known for his viral video impersonations of Trump, garnered more than 32,000 likes and 390,000 views for a video posted Monday.\n\nMelania Trump\u2019s comments about abortion rights\n\nFormer first lady Melania Trump suggested a break with her husband over abortion rights in her new memoir and social media video.\n\nIn a video posted to X on Thursday morning, the former first lady said that she believes there is \u201cno room for compromise\u201d when it comes to a woman\u2019s \u201cindividual freedom.\u201d The video followed a story from The Guardian on excerpts from her forthcoming book in which she says that \u201crestricting a woman\u2019s right to choose whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy is the same as denying her control over her own body.\u201d\n\nIn the first five hours after it posted, the video got more than 473,000 views on X. \u201cMelania Trump\u201d was trending on Thursday afternoon, with more than 35,000 posts about her circling the platform \u2014 many also mentioned the CNN story about her book publisher requesting a quarter of a million dollars for an interview. As of Friday afternoon, the video had surged to about 4.3 million views.\n\nDonald Trump regularly takes credit for the overturning of Roe v.

Photo provided.\n\nBy Clinton Colmenares, Senior Director of News and Media Strategy\n\nOn Nov. 7, two days after the presidential election, one of the country\u2019s foremost presidential historians will present \u201cLessons in Character and Leadership from Seven American Presidents\u201d at the Poinsett Club in Greenville.\n\nMark Updegrove, president and chief executive officer of the LBJ Foundation, the presidential historian for ABC News, a former director of the LBJ Presidential Library and the author of five books on the presidency, will sign books starting at 5:30 p.m. and begin his presentation at 6 p.m. The event is sponsored by the American History Book Club and Forum and Furman University.\n\nUpdegrove\u2019s speech will draw on meetings and exclusive interviews with seven U.S. presidents to examine lessons in character and leadership: Gerald R. Ford (doing right), Jimmy Carter (doing good), Ronald Reagan (optimism), George H.W. Bush (humility), Bill Clinton (resilience), George W. Bush (compassion) and Barack Obama (grace). Updegrove looks at how each man, overcoming inherent flaws in his nature and setbacks in his administration, drew on the best aspects of his character to contribute to our country \u2013 and ultimately to his legacy. The presentation includes photographs and short clips from interviews.\n\nFor more information and to purchase tickets ($50), visit www.furman.edu/ahbc, call 864-294-3351 or email [email protected]. Proceeds from ticket sales support the work of two area teachers and a local student through the A.V. and Kate Huff History Scholars awards.\n\nThis year\u2019s A.V. and Kate Huff History Scholars student and teacher award winners, whose prizes are supported through proceeds from ticket sales, will also be recognized at the event. The awards are named for A.V. Huff, a former Furman professor, dean and vice president for academic affairs, and his wife Kate Huff, a former elementary school teacher.\n\nThe winner of the A.V. Huff History Scholars Award is Furman student Emily Anne Harris \u201925, of Hartsville, South Carolina. A history major minoring in Medieval and early modern studies, Harris will continue her work on an exhibit and book for Furman\u2019s bicentennial celebration with Courtney Tollison, Distinguished University Public Historian and Scholar at Furman. After graduation, Harris plans to pursue a graduate degree in historic preservation.\n\nThe Kate Huff History Scholars award will go to area teachers to support class history projects or field trips. This year\u2019s recipients are David Bernardy of Greenville, South Carolina, and Ashley Blackwelder \u201903 M\u201905 of Spartanburg, South Carolina.\n\nAn elementary teacher at Sterling School in Greenville, Bernardy recently completed Furman\u2019s certification program for elementary education. He will use the grant to partially fund a visit to the Cowpens National Battlefield Park in Cowpens, South Carolina. Students will tour the Cowpens museum, view educational films about the Southern Campaign of the American Revolution and walk on a ranger-led trail detailing the important turning points of the battle.\n\nBlackwelder, the STEAM (science, technology, engineering, art and math) coordinator for grades K-5 at Fairforest Elementary in Spartanburg, holds a bachelor\u2019s degree in elementary education and a master\u2019s degree in literacy from Furman. Blackwelder will use the grant to fund a year-long \u201cFairforest Family Tree\u201d project that will include a mural, a \u201cfamily tree\u201d painting and school-wide international night.\n\nUpdegrove\u2019s books include \u201cBaptism by Fire: Eight Presidents Who Took Office in Times of Crisis\u201d; \u201cThe Last Republicans: Inside the Extraordinary Relationship Between George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush\u201d; and \u201cIncomparable Grace: JFK in the Presidency.\u201d He is working on a book about lessons in leadership, the topic of his American History Book Club talk.\n\nIn 2014, while Updegrove was president of the LBJ Presidential Library, he hosted the Civil Rights Summit with Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George H. W. Bush and Jimmy Carter.",

        "text": "Which way are key demographic groups leaning in the 2024 election?\nWe\u2019re now just about a month away from Election Day, and both former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris have been hard at work trying to persuade voters to pull the lever (or fill in the bubble, or touch the screen \u2026) for them in November. Their efforts to persuade voters are all over the news, too: Whether it\u2019s men, young voters, Latinos or Black voters, the campaigns are eager to discuss their outreach efforts to specific demographics that could be key to victory in November.\n\nTo see how well those outreach efforts are doing, we pulled together data from all the national polls in the last month to check how the electorate, and particularly these key demographic groups, have moved in response to last month\u2019s campaigning. In particular, we checked in on whether the emerging Harris coalition has changed since our last look at patterns in demographic support back in August.\n\nAt that time, Harris had a 2.8-percentage-point lead in our national polling average, not too different from her 2.6-point lead on Friday, Oct. 4 at 10 a.m. Eastern. So it may be unsurprising that, among most demographic groups, there haven\u2019t been many significant shifts since August.*\n\nWhat does a racial realignment really look like?\n\nIn August, Harris was more or less polling even with President Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 performance among white voters. But owing to an increase in support among white, college-educated voters, she\u2019s slightly improved on that margin in the last month. She\u2019s made small gains with Black and Hispanic voters too, but she continues to lag far behind Biden\u2019s 2020 performance among these voters, a dynamic that has been fairly consistent throughout the 2024 campaign (we first noted Democratic erosion among these groups in spring of 2023).\n\nTo get a sense for how it might change the electoral map if Harris marginally improves upon Biden\u2019s performance with white voters but slides significantly among Black and Hispanic voters, we turned to 538\u2019s Swing-O-Matic. Keeping all other variables equal, we set the margins among white, Black and Hispanic voters equal to the average margin we currently see in crosstabs, and the result is an extremely close race.**\n\nThe results of 538's Swing-O-Matic show that if Harris gains white voters but loses more Black and Hispanic voters she can still win with 270 electoral votes. Amina Brown for 538.\n\nAccording to the Swing-O-Matic, if Harris improves upon Biden\u2019s margin among white voters by only 2-3 points,*** she could still eke out a win even if she loses significant ground among Black and Hispanic voters. The results indicate a victory of exactly 270 electoral votes for Harris, with Trump earning 268 electoral votes. And the outcomes among the swing states are fairly predictable: The northern battlegrounds of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, which are whiter than the Sun Belt swing states, would stay in the Democratic camp, while all the southern battlegrounds would vote for Trump.\n\nOf course, this exact scenario may not come to pass. Notably, we haven\u2019t changed any other variables here: Turnout remains the same among all groups as it was in 2020, which is probably not going to happen. In addition, this scenario assumes uniform shifts nationwide, which is also unlikely: Hispanic voters in states like Florida, Arizona and Texas have shifted further to the right than those in states like California or Pennsylvania, for example.\n\nPlus, it\u2019s likely that the polls won\u2019t be exactly on the mark. Every election cycle features some amount of polling error, which would push us away from this razor-close scenario in one direction or the other. Five of the seven key swing states in this scenario would be decided by a margin of less than 2.5 points, so even a historically small amount of polling error \u2014 3 points in either direction \u2014 would probably flip at least two states (and possibly the election).\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that, among pollsters who focus on particular subgroups, the decrease in support for Harris among nonwhite voters is less pronounced. For example, in a UnidosUS/BSP Research poll of Hispanic voters conducted in August, Harris earned 66 percent of the two-party vote among Latinos, higher than the 58 percent we see in national crosstabs. And in a Howard University survey of Black voters in battleground states, Harris earned 87 percent of their two-party support; she\u2019s at just 82 percent in national crosstabs.\n\nNonwhite voters have traditionally been more difficult to reach in surveys, so it may be that polling of the full electorate is understating Harris\u2019s support among these demographics. However, even taking these more generous estimates of Harris\u2019s support among Black and Hispanic voters into account doesn\u2019t change the picture much: Using the results from the UnidosUS and Howard University surveys in our Swing-o-Matic scenario flips only one state, Nevada, to Harris\u2019s column.\n\nThe gender gap is narrowing \u2014 but not among young voters\n\nA recurring theme of the 2024 election has been Trump\u2019s attempts to make inroads with younger voters, particularly young men. And while, overall, Harris is coming fairly close to Biden\u2019s 2020 performance among voters aged 18-29 in polling (in September, she averaged 60 percent of the two-party vote among this age group, compared with Biden\u2019s 63 percent performance in 2020), other data suggests that young men and women may actually be drifting in different political directions.\n\nAs we noted in August, the Harris campaign had slowly been moving men into her camp, a trend that has continued into September: Her two-party vote share among men has grown about 2 points, while her polling among women has been fairly stable. While we don\u2019t have enough crosstab data to look at young voters by gender in the polls overall (and the sample sizes for such a crosstab would likely be too small to be useful), we can use surveys specific to young people, such as the Harvard Youth Poll, to get some insight into how those voters are thinking about the election. And in the Harvard Youth Poll\u2019s most recent survey from September, we see an enormous difference in the gender gap among young people versus in the electorate overall.\n\nWhile the gender gap (the difference between the share of men and the share of women who say they will vote for Harris) in our average of national crosstabs has narrowed to about 9 points, the gender gap among young voters has widened significantly, from just 4 points in the spring Harvard Youth Poll between Trump and Biden to 17 points in the latest poll, even as Harris has improved on Biden\u2019s polling among both young men and young women.\n\nOn the other hand, the gender gap among young voters in the Harvard Youth Poll isn\u2019t too different from what we saw in the 2020 election. While the Pew Research Center\u2019s validated voter survey from 2020 doesn\u2019t include a breakdown of voters by age and gender, we can get a rough estimate of the gender gap from the 2020 exit polls. According to that data, 52 percent of young men said they voted for Biden, while 67 percent of young women said the same \u2014 a gender gap of 15 points, not too different from the 17-point gap in the Harvard Youth Poll. So while the gender gap among young voters has widened significantly since the spring, it may be less reflective of the GOP\u2019s success in moving young men to their side and more about the young electorate returning to where it has been in the past.\n\n* * *\n\nNow, this analysis comes with a caveat: You probably shouldn\u2019t make too much of a big deal over small differences in crosstabs between one month and the next. Crosstabs can be quite noisy, with small sample sizes and large margins of error, so a shift of a point or two is probably not indicative of significant changes in the electorate overall.\n\nThat being said, the overall picture here is generally not one of change, but of stability. Despite a month\u2019s worth of campaigning, a debate that was watched by nearly 70 million people and hundreds of millions of dollars worth of paid advertising, the 2024 race does not appear to have shifted much at all \u2014 not even at the level of specific demographic groups. You can see this in our national polling average too: Since Aug. 30, Harris\u2019s lead in the national polls has varied by less than a point. (Specifically, it has been between 2.4 and 3.3 percentage points every day.)\n\nAs with the last two elections, this race may come down to voters who decide who they\u2019re supporting late in the game, a group that is historically less engaged with political news and may not be paying attention to the campaigns yet. It\u2019s tempting to think that, if we stare at these polling numbers long enough, the truth of who will win the election will jump out at us. But the reality is, late movement in the race can be unpredictable, and the winner hasn\u2019t been determined yet.\n\nFootnotes\n\n*Each candidate\u2019s two-party vote share is calculated as the percent of respondents in each poll who say they plan to vote for that candidate divided by the percent who say they plan to vote for either Harris or Trump. If a poll asked more than one horse-race question, we used the question with the fewest candidates (for these purposes, we treated a generic \"other candidate\" option like a candidate). If a poll released results among more than one population or sampling frame, we used the narrowest population; that is to say, we prefer likely voters to registered voters and registered voters to all adults. For the August averages, we included all publicly available national polls that published crosstabs and were conducted between July 21 and Aug. 17 and released by 9 a.m. Eastern on Aug. 20. For the September averages, we included all publicly available national polls that published crosstabs, had a final field date between Sept. 1 and Sept. 30 and were released by 10 a.m. Eastern on Oct. 4.\n\n**For this scenario, the margins used are the topline margin among each demographic group, rather than the margin of the two-party vote.\n\n***There is no definitive source on how different demographic groups voted in the 2020 election, since all votes are anonymous. According to the Pew Research Center validated voter study of the 2020 electorate, this change represents a shift of 2 points among white voters, while according to the 2020 Cooperative Election Study, this represents a shift of 3 points. Unless otherwise noted, Biden's performance in the 2020 election in this article is calculated as the percent of voters who voted for Biden divided by the percent who voted for either Biden or Trump, according to the Pew Research Center.",

Among people who would support parties in the ruling coalition led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu if an election in Israel were today, 88% picked Trump as better for Israel's security and 84% preferred him for the U.S. presidency -- results that may reflect tensions between Netanyahu's government and the Biden administration.\n\nSupporters of Israeli opposition parties, by contrast, split closely, 39%-37%, Harris-Trump, in preference for the presidency. That said, even opposition party supporters picked Trump over Harris as better for Israel's security, albeit by a comparatively close 41%-32%.\n\nIsraeli flag is seen in the Old City in Jerusalem, Israel, Dec. 29, 2022.

To the contrary, \"considering the challenges of conducting battles in populated areas,\" 54% said Israel is doing too much to avoid such casualties. Twenty-eight percent said it's doing the right amount; 14%, too little.\n\nThe three questions in this study were included in a random-sample, face-to-face survey of 1,012 Israelis, with fieldwork by PORI, Sept. 8-22, before the bulk of Israel's campaign against Hezbollah and Iran's subsequent missile attack this week. (Eighty-two percent of interviews were completed before Sept. 17, when thousands of Hezbollah pagers exploded.)\n\nThe U.S. election\n\nIn this combination of photos taken in Pennsylvania, Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris speaks at a campaign event, Aug. 18, 2024, in Rochester, left, and Republican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump speaks during a campaign event, Aug. 19, 2024, in York. AP\n\nIn addition to the political gaps in attitudes toward the U.S. presidential candidates, ethnic and religious differences are sharp. Sixty-four percent of Jews picked Trump over Harris as better for Israel's security, while Arabs, who account for about 17% of Israel's adult citizen population, divided essentially evenly, 27%-24%; 36% saw no difference between the two. In vote preference, Jews went for Trump by 58%-23%, while Arabs split 28%-26%; the rest said they wouldn't participate or didn't express a preference.\n\nGaps also are present within the Jewish population. The shares picking Trump as better on security ranged from 53% of secular Jews to 88% of Orthodox Jews. Patterns are similar in preference for the presidency: Secular Jews favored Trump by 11 points, 46%-35%, widening to 65%-17% among traditional Jews and 69%-3% among ultra-Orthodox Jews, and peaking for Trump at 85%-4% among Orthodox Jews.\n\nTrump vs. Harris in Israeli Attitudes. Langer Reasearch/PORI poll\n\nU.S. election preferences among Israeli Jews overall are sharply different from those of Jews in the United States. In ABC News/Ipsos polling, combining late August and mid-September surveys for an adequate sample size, U.S. Jews favored Harris over Trump by 63%-33%.\n\nAnother difference is by age. In the United States, Harris does best with younger adults. In Israel, it's Trump who does best in this group, with 65% of those younger than 35 picking Trump on security and 58% supporting him for president. These drop to 52% and 48% for Trump, respectively, among Israelis age 65 and older.\n\nTrump also prevails among Israelis in strength of sentiment. Thirty percent overall said they'd \"surely\" support Trump for president, vs. 10% who said this about Harris; and 37% said Trump would be \"much\" better for Israel's security, compared with 12% for Harris.\n\nCivilian casualties in Gaza\n\nThere also are ethnic, religious and political gaps in views of efforts to avoid civilian casualties in Gaza, given the challenges of urban combat. Strikingly, while just 7% of Jews said Israel is doing too little to avoid such casualties, that rises to 50% of Israeli Arabs.\n\nAmong Jews, about eight in 10 of those who are Orthodox or ultra-Orthodox said Israel is doing too much to avoid civilian casualties. This falls to 63% of traditional Jews and 47% of secular Jews.\n\nPolitically, among those who favor coalition parties, 76% said Israel is doing too much to avoid civilian casualties. This declines to 41% of opposition party supporters, with 21% saying Israel is doing too little; 34%, about the right amount.\n\nIsrael's efforts to avoid civilian casualties in Gaza. Langer Reasearch/PORI poll\n\nAbout this survey\n\nThis survey is a joint project of Langer Research Associates, a New York-based firm that specializes in the design, management and analysis of public opinion research domestically and internationally; and PORI (Public Opinion Research Israel), a leading Israeli public opinion research firm founded in 1966. The study's questions were asked as a part of PORI's September face-to-face omnibus survey.\n\nThe survey was conducted in Hebrew and Arabic among 1,012 respondents across Israel via area probability sampling. One hundred primary sampling units were randomly selected, with households selected via random walk and respondents selected via the last-birthday method. Up to three revisits were made at each selected household. In quality control, 20% of each interviewer's work was re-checked randomly by phone.\n\nData were weighted for probability of selection and calibrated to census data for sex by age and region. Results have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 points for the full sample, including a design effect due to weighting of 1.05. As in any survey, error margins are larger for subgroups. Sampling error is not the only source of differences in polls.",

I don\u2019t know whether it'll be peaceful,\u201d Biden said during a surprise appearance at the White House daily briefing. \u201cThe things that Trump has said and the things that he said last time out, when he didn\u2019t like the outcome of the election, were very dangerous.\u201d\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBiden noted that during this week\u2019s vice presidential debate, Trump\u2019s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, would not say whether Trump would accept the outcome of the election. When asked if he and Trump would challenge the election results \u2014 even if every governor in the nation certified them \u2014 Vance demurred, saying he and Trump were \u201cfocused on the future.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about what [Biden] said,\u201d Trump told reporters in Georgia on Friday following the president's remarks. \u201cI only can hope that it's going to be free and fair, and I think in this state it will be, and I hope in every state it will be, and I think we're going to do very well.\u201d\n\nTrump often links himself winning with fairness.\n\nSpeaking to reporters earlier this week, Trump said, \u201cAll I want is a fair election. That\u2019s all. Just a fair, honest election. I hope we\u2019re going to get that.\u201d\n\nBut when pressed on whether he trusts the process this year, he responded, \u201cI\u2019ll let you know in 33 days.\u201d Two days later, in Michigan, Trump again lied about the results of the 2020 election.\n\n\"We won. We won. We did win,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt was a rigged election. It was a rigged election. You have to tell Kamala Harris. That's why I'm doing it again. If I'd thought I lost, I wouldn't be doing this again.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s remarks came during a week in which a newly unsealed court filing by special counsel Jack Smith offered perhaps the most detailed picture to date about the former president\u2019s alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nThe 165-page document, released Wednesday by the U.S. District judge presiding over the case, says that after Trump lost in 2020, he \u201cresorted to crimes to try to stay in office,\u201d and \u201claunched a series of increasingly desperate plans to overturn election results in seven states he had lost.\u201d",

[Brown University] \u2014 With Election Day quickly approaching, an expanding lineup of open-to-the-public events at Brown University is featuring expert analysis and discussion by Brown scholars and invited guests.\n\nFrom an Oct. 8 forum on election security to a post-election conversation on Nov. 6, the events will explore what\u2019s at stake in the 2024 elections, factors that might influence election outcomes and what citizens might expect from government in 2025.\n\nOrganized by departments and institutes across the University, the discussions are also focusing on voter rights and suppression, the intersection of climate and politics, and how the election may affect reproductive rights.\n\n\u201cThe 2024 election will be transformational for the next decade of American politics and the democracy itself,\u201d said Wendy Schiller, interim director of Brown\u2019s Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs. \u201cBringing together scholars, practitioners and policymakers is a key function of a university, and Brown continues to lead the way in engaging students and the public on these core issues of democracy.\u201d\n\nThe following events include just a sampling of confirmed upcoming election-related discussions at Brown, while even more remain in the planning stage. Full information on these and other events is available on the University events calendar, which is updated by event planners across campus on a daily basis.\n\nClimate Action and the 2024 Election: Science, Policy and Disinformation\n\nTuesday, Oct. 8, 12 p.m.\n\nBrown faculty experts will discuss the election\u2019s potential impact on the climate. Panelists Kim Cobb, director of the Institute at Brown for Environment and Society; Stefanie Friedhoff, co-founder of the Information Futures Lab at Brown\u2019s School of Public Health; and Chris Rae, an assistant professor of sociology and public and international affairs, will delve into pressing topics including environmental disinformation and the politization of climate science. This is the first of a two-part series that continues on Saturday, Oct. 26.\n\nThe 2024 John Hazen White Sr. Lecture: A Forum on Election Security with Ken Block and John Marion\n\nTuesday, Oct. 8, 5 p.m.\n\nThe Taubman Center for American Politics and Policy will host a conversation about election security, the integrity of election administration and the future of voting rights with Ken Block, who investigated claims of voter fraud for Donald Trump\u2019s campaign in 2020, and John Marion, executive director of Common Cause Rhode Island. Block, the author of \u201cDisproven: My Unbiased Search for Voter Fraud for the Trump Campaign, the Data that Shows Why He Lost, and How We Can Improve Our Elections,\u201d will remark on fraud and offer suggestions on how to improve election processes.

        "text": "The Right Honourable Stephen J. Harper Inspires at Judson University\u2019s 2024 World Leaders Forum\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\n\n\n\n(ELGIN, IL \u2013 October 2, 2024) \u2013 The Right Honourable Stephen J. Harper, 22nd Prime Minister of Canada, headlined the 2024 World Leaders Forum on October 2 on the campus of Judson University. Mr. Harper\u2019s main topic was the current state of global politics and in particular the impact of the upcoming United States presidential election.\n\n\u201cThe genius of your Founding Fathers was to create a system where it was very difficult to do anything politically without consensus, so that in the absence of consensus, people with energy and enterprise would get on with solving the problems of their own lives,\u201d Harper stated during his opening remarks. \u201cAnd I can tell you this as someone who has been around the globe, both in the world of politics and in the world of economics \u2013 there is nothing in the world even today that compares to the dynamism and the scale of the American entrepreneurial community.\u201d\n\nHarper\u2019s keynote address captivated the audience, offering rich insights into global leadership and his personal experiences navigating Canada through a decade of complex challenges. Harper emphasized the need for resilience and adaptability in leaders, particularly in today\u2019s unpredictable global climate.\n\nThe event was hosted by Rich Lowry, editor in chief of The National Review. The program include remarks from World Leaders Forum Board of Directors Chair and Editor-in-Chief of Illinois Review, formals remarks from Mr. Haper, and then an engaging question-and-answer session with Harper and Lowry that featured questions from the audience. Participants asked about global cooperation, economic strategy, and Harper\u2019s thoughts on how today\u2019s leaders can foster stability in an increasingly polarized world.\n\nHarper\u2019s words left a lasting impression. \u201cAnything we face today\u2014when we have more wealth, more people, and are living longer, healthier lives; when freedom and democracy remain models for the world; and when a technological revolution is transforming human existence\u2014everything is possible if we constrain human rebellion against God and keep our political mistakes to a reasonable clout.\u201d\n\nJudson University alumnus Tom McCoy and his wife Jade drove from Marshalltown, Iowa to attend the event. McCoy who is a member of the Judson University Alumni Board of Directors said of the event, \u201cI\u2019m amazed that we have world leaders in here, but we also have a lot of common people in here that do a lot of great things for Judson and for people around the world. I was able to sit with a student from Spain which was wonderful and got to know him. The next thing I know I\u2019m shaking the hand of a former prime minister. It was really a beautiful evening. \u201d\n\nJudson University student, Katherine Breinig remarked, \u201cHearing Mr.Harpers perspective on the geopolitical climate and the deep understanding of the US\u2019s politics was amazing to see. It is encouraging when we have leaders who understand how the world works and fights for right. Mr. Harper also gave 3 big trends in the world and 3 trends that are optimistic. Seeing the negative and positive in the world is a good balance.\n\nJudson University President Dr. Gene Crume expressed his gratitude for Harper\u2019s contribution to the forum, stating, \u201cPrime Minister Harper\u2019s message deeply resonated with our audience. His experiences and leadership insights were not only informative but also inspiring. It was a remarkable night, and we are thrilled that so many people had the opportunity to take part.\u201d\n\nProceeds from the event will fund student scholarships at the university as well as provide support for Judson\u2019s Roeser Scholars and RISE programs, ensuring that future leaders continue to benefit from educational opportunities that foster growth, integrity, and vision.\n\n###\n\nAbout Judson University:\n\nLocated in Elgin, Illinois, since 1963, Judson University offers a Christian liberal arts and sciences education through its Bachelor of Arts degrees in more than 60 majors, minors, graduate programs, and online courses, as well as certification and accelerated adult degree programs.

        "text": "How weather could swing the 2024 U.S. presidential election\nDennis Mersereau Digital Journalist Foul weather could cast a deciding vote in the upcoming presidential election in the United States\n\nVoting is underway in one of the world\u2019s most consequential elections of the year.\n\nMore than one hundred million Americans will decide by November 5 whether to make Vice President Kamala Harris the first woman to lead the U.S., or to send former president Donald Trump back to the White House for another four-year term.\n\nWeather can play a significant role in the outcome of elections. Here\u2019s a look at how severe weather, Hurricane Helene, and a myriad of other factors could act like a swing vote in the race.\n\nMUST SEE: Seven times weather unexpectedly changed the course of history\n\nWhy weather can swing an American election\n\nHow can weather affect the outcome of the presidential race when the United States is such a large country? American presidential elections are won and lost on the state level rather than through a national popular vote.\n\nThe election is decided through a complex system known as the Electoral College. There are 538 electoral votes spread proportionally among the 50 states and Washington, D.C. With a few exceptions, the candidate who wins a state receives that state\u2019s electoral votes. A candidate needs 270 electoral votes to win the presidency.\n\nThis process imparts oversized importance to a handful of swing states throughout the country, where polling shows the results could land on a razor-thin margin either way. The main swing states in the 2024 election are widely considered to be Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.",

        "text": "How long of a shadow is the Middle East conflict casting on the US election?\nBy Boyd Wagner\n\nAs the the US presidential election campaign reaches its peak with just one month to go before the vote, Euronews examines how influential the heightened tensions and simmering conflict in the Middle East are on US voters.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nEarlier this week, the two lesser-known running mates of Donald Trump and Kamala Harris squared off in a vice-presidential debate in New York City.\n\nWhile Senator JD Vance (R-Ohio) and Governor Tim Walz (D-Minnesota) faced a heavy dose of domestic-focused questions, the opening topic of the night was the ongoing fight between Israel and Iran-backed Hamas.\n\nThe question came just hours after Iran launched a largely unsuccessful barrage of ballistic missiles aimed at Israel, highlighting the importance of the current Middle East conflict and the impact the war could have on voters come November.\n\nAs the US election draws closer in a race where polls show a neck-and-neck contest between Trump and Harris, Iran\u2019s growing direct involvement with Israel could make the Middle East conflict a higher priority issue for American voters.\n\nWhile Benjamin Netanyahu would likely prefer a more supportive Republican White House led by Donald Trump, the Israeli prime minister nonetheless sits in a position of greater flexibility and autonomy than he has been afforded in months.\n\nTehran\u2019s bombardment of Israel came as a response to a series of blows that Israel landed on Iran\u2019s allies, including the assassination of Hamas\u2019s Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran and the assault on Hezbollah in Lebanon.\n\nThe calculated risk made by Iran could lead to further escalation by Israel, which has been emboldened by recent successes in the war. While Joe Biden's administration will seek to tamper any escalation, both Netanyahu and the Democrat-led White House know that matters are complicated by the election just one month away.\n\nAmericans backing Israel\n\nMost US voters are supportive of Israel in the ongoing conflict. According to an August survey by the Chicago Council on Foreign Affairs, 60% of Americans favour the US supporting Israel militarily until Hamas releases all hostages, while half of Americans favour such support until Hamas is entirely dismantled.\n\nWhile Americans explicitly do not want to be directly involved in another Middle East conflict, more than 60% of them support the US playing a positive role in resolving problems in the region. Among Jewish and Muslim Americans, those numbers are even higher.\n\nPublic support for Israel stretches beyond party lines, though the details matter. Republican voters consistently poll with over 70% in support of Israel, weapons aid and their military actions.\n\nIsraeli army tanks maneuver in a staging area in northern Israel near the Israel-Lebanon border, 1 October 2024 AP Photo/Baz Ratner\n\nDemocrats' support is more tenuous but remains above 40% in favour of aid, although many Democrats think that the US is doing too much for Israel. Across age brackets, only among voters 18-29 does the support of Israel fall under 55%. Among older Americans, the country\u2019s most reliable voting population, more than 70% of voters support Israel.\n\nThe Palestinian Authority, meanwhile, is seeing its support in America drop, according to the Gallup. As of March, US support for Palestine\u2019s leading body fell to just 18%, its lowest in five years.\n\nAlthough Israel holds strong support among a plurality of Americans, Israel\u2019s Prime Minister remains more controversial.\n\nPer Gallup, only 35% of Americans hold a favourable view of Benjamin Netanyahu, with 45% holding an unfavourable view. Netanyahu\u2019s support, however, is strongly split along party lines, with 66% support among Republicans compared to just 12% favorability among Democrats.\n\nPressure to be pro-Israel\n\nWhile the US public support for Israel doubtlessly plays a role in each campaign\u2019s posture toward the conflict, there is also the role of special interests and, in an election year, donor interests.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) is one of the most important lobbies and campaign contributors in Washington.\n\nAIPAC has already spent over $17 million in campaign donations in 2024, with more than $15 million (\u20ac13.7m), or 86.9%, contributed to Democratic Party candidates and organizations. AIPAC has spent countless days over the past year to boost aid to Israel, wielding more influence in an election year.\n\nDraped in an Israeli flag, a pro-Israel supporter walks with an American flag near the pro-Palestinian encampment on the UCLA campus in Los Angeles, 30 April 2024 AP Photo/Jae C. Hong\n\nThe Democrats are also the beneficiaries of donations from countless private donors with an interest in supporting Israel, from Hollywood to New York City.\n\nThere is also the influence of the Electoral College, which proportions 538 votes between the US states for choosing the president. The Electoral College system turns a series of \u201cswing states\u201d into the ultimate decision-makers for the US presidency.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nChief among the battleground states is Pennsylvania, where more than 300,000 Jewish voters make up a larger-than-average percentage of the state\u2019s voters. Nevada, another crucial swing state, also boasts an above-average percentage of Jewish voters.\n\nIn each of America\u2019s roughly seven swing states, the margins should prove to be razor-thin and will likely come down to a few thousand votes. Neither campaign can afford to take any voting bloc for granted.\n\nHarris and the Democrats walk the high wire\n\nPresident Biden has time and again repeated his support for Israel, pointing to the aide package his administration helped to deliver. The president, however, is of a different era within his own party.\n\nSince the war in Gaza broke out last autumn following Hamas\u2019s surprise attack, the Democrats have found themselves split between traditional support for Israel and a younger, strongly progressive sect of the party that is more sympathetic to Palestinians, blaming Israel for the ongoing conflicts in the region.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe divide among the Democrats leaves Vice President Harris with a fine line to walk as she navigates her snap candidacy.\n\nWhile Harris has repeatedly voiced her support for Israel and backed her boss\u2019s strategy in the conflict, she has a history of making comments that suggest her support is less steadfast than Biden\u2019s, perhaps a nod to the base of the party that is much more critical of Israel.\n\nDemocratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris waves as she boards Air Force Two at Joint Base Andrews, MD, 3 October 2024 AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein\n\nLast week, Democratic New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said in an interview that she believes that Harris is \u201creceptive\u201d to the concerns of the Democratic base over the conflict.\n\nOcasio-Cortez pointed to the myriad university protests in support of Palestine, noting the importance of the progressive and youth vote for Democrats.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHarris\u2019 statements on Israel remain closer to those of Biden than Ocasio-Cortez, with her campaign likely seeing the same data that shows larger public support for Israel, as well as pressure from donors and lobbyists.\n\nMeanwhile, Harris is failing to amass support among the Arab American community. A September poll from the Council on American-Islamic Relations showed Harris trailing Trump with Arab American voters, historically a 2-1 advantage for Democrats.\n\nIn 2020, Biden won more than 60% of the Arab American vote, 16% better than Harris currently projects based on the poll.\n\nWith polling well within the margin of error, Harris cannot afford to drop support among Jewish voters, giving Israel and Netanyahu a longer runway to act without major public oversight from the White House\u2019s preferred successor.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Republican position and a boost for Bibi\n\nDespite Republicans' increasingly isolationist views in recent years under the Trump MAGA banner, Israel has managed to maintain the right\u2019s hawkish support.\n\nIn response to Tuesday\u2019s debate question regarding an Israeli pre-emptive strike on Iran, Trump\u2019s running-mate JD Vance affirmed his campaign\u2019s belief that the US should support Israel to do whatever they feel is necessary to defend their home and people.\n\nRepublicans have long been hawkish towards Iran. During the 2016 campaign, Trump regularly blasted Hillary Clinton and President Barack Obama for negotiating with Tehran and releasing billions of dollars in frozen assets, a deal that Trump dismantled once he was inaugurated.\n\nRepublican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump dances at a campaign event at the Ryder Center at Saginaw Valley State University, in Michigan, 3 October 2024 AP Photo/Carlos Osorio\n\nTrump, Vance and their surrogates have regularly driven the message that, under Trump\u2019s administration, the current global chaos from Ukraine to the Middle East was not the norm.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThey blame the conflicts on \u201cweak\u201d leadership of Biden and Harris. Their unabashed support of Israel has coincided with a larger narrative of peace through strength \u2014 a message that may be working on many Americans.\n\nIran\u2019s moves and counter-moves will only increase American sympathy for Israel. The latest attack has given Israel the freedom to act more aggressively while American leaders walk on eggshells ahead of the election next month. That could soon end.\n\nIf Harris wins, Israel could find itself held to a new set of conditions laid out by a less-friendly White House.\n\nIf Trump takes the White House again this November, Netanyahu will find himself in a stronger position than he has seen in years. For now, Netanyahu can continue to operate from a position of strength and confidence.",

Seal the second (inner) envelope, place it inside the first (outer) envelope, and mail the package to U.S. Embassy Seoul.\n\nNormal transit time from Seoul to the United States is 7-10 business days.\n\nRegistering to Vote and submitting a ballot is fast, easy, and can be done from anywhere in the world! Follow a few simple steps to vote in the 2024 U.S. elections.\n\n1. Register to vote: Start by confirming your voter registration with your state. Some states require absentee voters to register annually, so you may need to re-register. Go to FVAP.gov to connect to your state\u2019s voter portal to register to vote, request a ballot, and more.\n\n2. Request Your Ballot: Most states provide the option to request ballots through their state election portals, which you can easily access via FVAP.gov. You can also choose to complete a Federal Post Card Application (FPCA). The FPCA allows you to register and request an absentee ballot for all elections for federal offices (President, U.S. Senate, and U.S. House of Representatives), including primaries and special elections, during the calendar year in which it is submitted. FPCA forms that are correctly filled out are accepted by all local election officials in every U.S. state and territory. FVAP\u2019s online assistant can help you complete the FPCA. If you need to check the status of your FPCA, contact your local election office.\n\nWe suggest that you select the option to receive your ballot electronically when available.\n\nFor the 2024 U.S. elections, you should send in your FPCA by August 1, 2024.\n\n3. Receive and Complete Your Ballot: States are required to send out ballots 45 days before a regular election for federal office, and states generally send out ballots at least 30 days before primary elections. Most states allow you to confirm your ballot delivery online.\n\n4. Return Your Completed, Signed Ballot: Some states allow you to return your completed ballot electronically. If your state requires you to return paper voting forms or ballots to local election officials by mail, you can do so through international mail, a professional courier service, or the U.S. Embassy in Seoul. You will need to place your ballots in a postage paid labeled envelope before submitting them at the U.S. Embassy in Seoul. Please place your ballots in the outside drop-off box at the Embassy rear gate or mail them to the Embassy using the instructions listed above.\n\nIt can take up to two weeks for mail to reach its destination if sent by the Embassy via diplomatic pouch. All overseas U.S. citizens are advised to submit their forms and ballots accordingly.\n\nContact Information:\n\nIf you have any questions about registering to vote overseas, please contact U.S. Mission Korea\u2019s Voting Assistance Officer at SeoulINFOACS@state.gov.",

The committee eventually released a report on security failures and outlining recommendations for the future.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has also since signed Klobuchar\u2019s bill that gives the Capitol police chief the ability to call in the National Guard without needing signoff from the Capitol Police Board.\n\nAnd the Electoral Count Reform Act now on the books will make it harder for Congress to contest a state\u2019s electoral vote during the Jan. 6 certification. Previously, just one member in the House and one in the Senate could challenge the electoral votes on Jan. 6, but the bill, which Klobuchar co-sponsored, now raises that threshold to one-fifth of each chamber.",

        "text": "Will the US vice-presidential debate make a difference? Here\u2019s what happened\nIf viewers were expecting fireworks, such as those in September\u2019s presidential debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, last night\u2019s debate between vice-presidential hopefuls J.D. Vance and Tim Walz was a damp squib.\n\nIt offered those tuning in a welcome return to a less fevered (and fairly respectful) political discourse about policy issues, although it still presented opportunities for both candidates to make errors and attack the opposing presidential candidates.\n\nThis was the last television debate before the election on November 5, so this was the final chance for the teams to spar on policy positions in this format and at this length. It was also the first extensive opportunity for Vance and Walz to go head-to-head, despite some previous online engagement.\n\nThe debate had been previewed by some observers as potentially crucial to the result of November\u2019s election because the race is currently so close. However, it would appear that neither side damaged the cause of their opponent, nor made major gains.\n\nIn a reaction survey immediately after the event, a CBS poll claimed that 42% thought that Vance had won, while 41% thought that Walz could claim victory, with the remainder undecided. So overall it was too close to call, a bit like the election result more generally.\n\nWalz felt fairly flat\n\nBefore his appointment, Walz had reportedly warned Harris that he was a terrible debater, and it was clear from the start that Vance was more at ease on stage.\n\nDespite this, Walz did a fairly good job, although he did flounder a little when pressed on foreign policy. When asked about whether a Harris presidency would support a pre-emptive Israeli strike on Iran, Walz ducked the question.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s fundamental here is that steady leadership is going to matter,\u201d Walz said before arguing that a \u201cnearly 80-year-old Donald Trump talking about crowd sizes is not what we need in this moment\u201d.\n\nThe vice-presidential debate.\n\nIn comparison, Vance committed a second Trump administration to wholeheartedly supporting Israel and ended by stating that during his presidency: \u201cDonald Trump actually delivered stability in the world, and he did it by establishing effective deterrence,\u201d and that \u201cpeople were afraid of stepping out of line\u201d.\n\nWill the debate change anything?\n\nWhile that might have been a point scored for Vance, presidential elections are not won on foreign policy issues and domestic issues rightly dominated the rest of the debate.\n\nThe candidates clashed on the economy, with Vance dismissing the Harris campaign\u2019s concerns about the potential impact of Trump imposing tariffs on imports.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump\u2019s economic plan is not just a plan, but it\u2019s also a record,\u201d he said, before adding that it was a record that \u201cI\u2019m proud to run on and we\u2019re going to get back to that common sense wisdom so that you can afford to live the American Dream again\u201d.\n\nOn immigration, Walz pointed out that Harris was \u201cthe only person in this race who prosecuted transnational gangs for human trafficking and drug interventions\u201d.\n\nWhile recognising there was an issue with illegal immigration, Walz said that Vance was \u201cstanding with Donald Trump and not working together to find a solution\u201d.\n\nArguably, the discussion about abortion was where Walz made the biggest inroads. He used personal stories, in much the same way as Harris did in the presidential debate, to highlight what he said was a \u201cbasic human right\u201d.\n\nVance admitted that the Republican party was not trusted on the issue and instead said that Republicans want to make it easier for families to afford to have a home and raise children. When he accused the Democrats of being pro-abortion. Walz responded: \u201cWe\u2019re pro-women.\u201d\n\nUnlike previous presidential debates, the fact checkers were rarely called into action but both candidates were given opportunity to address errors that they had made in the past.\n\nWalz admitted to being a \u201cknucklehead\u201d and corrected his previous claim that he had been in China during the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989, when he had not arrived in China until several months later.\n\nVance addressed suggestions that he had called Trump America\u2019s answer to Adolf Hitler earlier in his career. He was wrong, he said \u201cbecause I believed some of the media stories that turned out to be dishonest fabrications of his record\u201d.\n\nWhere Vance might have done better in persuading viewers to vote for him and Trump was when he was questioned directly by Walz about whether he believed Trump lost the 2020 election.\n\n\u201c\"Tim, I\u2019m focused on the future,\u201d was Vance\u2019s response which Walz called \u201ca damning non-answer\u201d.\n\nThe key takeaway from last night\u2019s debate was that politicians could engage in polite discourse and be civil to each other, something that has been lacking in recent years.\n\nAfter the debate, both candidates shook hands and patted each other on the back and introduced their wives to their opponent. Gone were the personal attacks which were replaced with respectful acknowledgement of opposite numbers. This was a refreshing change to the bitterness and name calling that has scarred politics for almost 20 years. Although it made for sedate viewing.\n\nThe lack of any bombshell moments means the debate is unlikely to have the major impact that commentators predicted. But both candidates would have been happy with their performances.\n\nWalz did not damage the momentum that Harris has built since her appointment, but neither did he really add to it.\n\nVance, on the other hand, is unlikely to win any Democrats over to his way of thinking, but certainly showed the Maga faithful that he could be Trump\u2019s successor beyond the next election.\n\nDafydd Townley, Teaching Fellow in International Security, University of Portsmouth\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

The past two days have gotten some \u2014 we\u2019ve gotten very good news about the American economy.\n\n\n\nJust yesterday, shipping carriers, after some discussion, and the International Longshoreman\u2019s Union came to an agreement to keep their ports in the East Coast and Gulf ports open. We averted what could have become a major crisis for the country. And a tentative agreement, which includes record wage increases for dockworkers and shows the importance of collective bargaining and represents, I think, critical progress toward a strong contract.\n\nI especially want to thank the carriers, the port operators, and the longshoreman\u2019s union for reaching this agreement at a time when the nation has experienced such terrible devastation from Hurricane Helene. It was truly a service to the American people for all the parties to come together and to respond to our request to keep the ports open.\n\nI was determined to \u2014 to avert a crisis at this moment, because it\u2019s a critical moment. If we didn\u2019t do this now, we\u2019d have a real problem.\n\nI also want to thank my White House team for the work \u2014 they worked around the clock to bring the parties together.\n\nBut, today, I \u2014 we got more incredible news. Although the strength of the American economy is a \u2014 it\u2019s about the strength of the American economy. The new jobs report, as you all know and you\u2019ve been reporting, created 250,000 jobs in September. The expectation was for 150,000 jobs in September, which is \u2014 far exceeds that number. Not only the previous two months \u2014 but not only that, the previous two months was revised up 150,000 \u2014 75,000 jobs.\n\nAnd from the very beginning, we were told time and again that the polices we were pursuing \u2014 we\u2019d put forward weren\u2019t \u2013weren\u2019t going to work, make things worse, including some of the other team who are still saying they\u2019re going to make things worse. But we\u2019ve proven them wrong.\n\nYou know, we were told our American \u2014 we\u2019ve \u2014 we were told our American Rescue Plan was too big and it would crowd out private investment. We proved them wrong. It vaccinated a nation and got immediate economic relief to people in need.\n\nWhen I came to office determined to end trickle-down economics and to grow the economy from the middle out and the bottom up \u2014 I know you\u2019re tired of hearing me say that over and over again, but that was the policy; it remains the policy \u2014 because when you do that, everyone does well. When the middle class grows, the nation is stronger. And the nation is stronger when there is a strong union movement as well.\n\nWe were told it wouldn\u2019t work, but I was also determined to do what was ignored for much too long. Presidents have been authorized since the \u201830s to be able to spend the money given by Congress \u2014 to spend the money on hiring American workers and using American product where they were available. And that\u2019s what we did.\n\nWe were told that was going to be a big problem, but all the money we \u2014 I was authorized to spend by the Congress has gone to building a mi- \u2014 to \u2014 gone to hiring American workers and using American products. We were told it wasn\u2019t going to be \u2014 I \u2014 we were told that was going to be a big problem, but it\u2019s working.\n\nWe were also told that our historic laws to invest in America and all Americans would crowd out private-sector investment. Well, that was proven wrong too.\n\nWe\u2019ve attracted nearly $1 trillion since we\u2019ve come to office in private-sector investment from domestic and foreign companies investing in America \u2014 in America. And not this stuff with sh- \u2014 shipping jobs overseas for cheaper labor and bringing back a product to America. We\u2019re building it here and sending it overseas. And look at the results across the board.\n\nUnemployment is back down 4- \u2014 to 4.1 percent. And every month f- \u2014 that Vice President Harris and I have been in office, we\u2019ve been \u2014 there\u2019s been \u2014 we\u2019ve created jobs every single month.\n\nThe nation has now created 16 million jobs since I\u2019ve come to office, more jobs created in a single presidential term than at any time in American history.\n\nOur GDP shows our economy grew at \u2014 at 10 percent under my administration. Unemployment reached the lowest level in 50 years.\n\nWe were also told inflation couldn\u2019t come down without massive job losses or sending the economy into economic recession.\n\n\n\nOnce again, the outside experts were wrong. Inflation has come way down. Wages have gone up, growing faster than prices. The interest rates are down. A record 19 million new business applications have been filed for. The stock market continues to reach new heights.\n\nWe\u2019ve got more work to do though to keep getting \u2014 keep \u2014 to keep getting prices down, like more affordable housing, extending what I\u2019ve done for seniors and lowering prescription drug costs by letting Medicare negotiate the prices \u2014 make sure that\u2019s available to everyone.\n\nAnd, by the way, what we\u2019ve done so far \u2014 just what we\u2019ve brought down the prices for seniors under Medicare, it saved the taxpayers billions of dollars \u2014 billions of dollars. Saved the taxpayers billions of dollars. That\u2019s important to note because they don\u2019t have to pay the exorbitant and ratio- \u2014 irrational prices that these companies are charging.\n\nThe simple fact is we\u2019ve gone from an economy in crisis to literally having the strongest economy in the world. And \u2014 but we got \u2014 we \u2014 we got more work to do. We\u2019ve got more work to do to deal the \u2014 the things I\u2019ve just mentioned. And we\u2019re going to have to deal with unforeseen costs of what this \u2014 this hu- \u2014 this hurricane is going to cost. It\u2019s going to cost a lot of money, and I\u2019m going to probably have to ask the Congress before we leave for more money to deal with some of those problems, but that remains to be seen.\n\nI\u2019ll take a few questions before I turn it over to \u2014\n\nQ Mr. President \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: You pick out the questions.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Oh, okay. Yes, sir. (Laughter.) Yes, sir.\n\nGo ahead, Josh.\n\nQ Thanks again for doing this, Mr. President. Two questions. The first, Florida Senator Marco Rubio described today\u2019s jobs report as having \u201cfake numbers.\u201d What do you make of that? And how worried are you that many Americans are hearing that the jobs numbers aren\u2019t real?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Look, I\u2019m going to be very careful here. If you notice anything the MAGA Republicans don\u2019t like, they call \u201cfake.\u201d Anything. The job numbers are what the job numbers are. They\u2019re real. They\u2019re sincere. They\u2019re \u2014 what we are.\n\nBut \u2014 and, by the way, just look at how the EU talks about us, how they\u2019d like to have an economy like ours. Let\u2019s talk about the rest of the world looks at us and what we\u2019re doing.\n\n\n\nSo, I \u2014 well, I don\u2019t want to get going.\n\n\n\nQ And \u2014 and then, secondly, could you clarify some of your comments yesterday with regard to strikes on Iranian oil facilities? What did you mean by them, given some of the reactions we\u2019re seeing in the market?\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, look, the Israelis have not concluded how they\u2019re \u2014 what they\u2019re going to do in terms of a strike. That\u2019s under discussion. I think there are \u2014 if I were in their shoes, I\u2019d be thinking about other alternatives than striking oil fields.\n\n\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Go ahead, Weijia.\n\n\n\nQ Thank you, Karine. Thank you so much, Mr. President, for being here.\n\nThis week, Senator Chris Murphy said, \u201cIt\u2019s certainly a possibility that the Israeli government is not going to sign any diplomatic agreement prior to the election,\u201d which is what you have been calling for for so long, \u201cpotentially to try to influence the result.\u201d\n\nDo you agree? Do you have any worries that Netanyahu may be trying to influence the election, and that\u2019s why he has not agreed to a diplomatic solution?\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: No administration has helped Israel more than I have. None. None. None. And I think Bibi should remember that.\n\nAnd whether he\u2019s trying to influence the election, I don\u2019t know, but I\u2019m not counting on that.\n\n\n\nQ You\u2019ve said many times recently that you want to speak to him, that you plan to \u2014\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: No, I didn\u2019t say \u201cplan to.\u201d I didn\u2019t say \u201cwant to.\u201d\n\n\n\nQ You don\u2019t want to?\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: No, I didn\u2019t say that. You\u2019re making it sound like I\u2019m seeking an inv- \u2014 speak- \u2014 I\u2019m assuming when they make their judgment of how they\u2019re going to respond, we will then have a discussion.\n\n\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Go ahead, Selina.\n\nQ Thank you.\n\n\n\nQ Thank you, Mr. President, for being here. What are you advising the Israelis to do in terms of their retaliation to Iran? And at this point, you still haven\u2019t spoken to Netanyahu. Is it fair to say that you have little personal influence over what he decides to do?\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: No. Look, our \u2014 our teams are in contact 12 hours a day. They\u2019re constantly in contact. I\u2019ve already had my presidential daily brief. We\u2019ve already had interface between our military, our \u2014 the diplomats. It\u2019s in constant contact.\n\n\n\nThey are trying to figure out \u2014 this is High Holidays as well. They\u2019re not going to make a decision immediately. And so, we\u2019re going to wait to see what they \u2014 when they want to talk.\n\n\n\nQ But over the past few months, they\u2019ve consistently defied your administration\u2019s own advice. So, do you believe that the Israelis are going to listen to the advice you\u2019re giving them?\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: What I know is the plan that I put together received the support of the U.N. Security Council and the vast majority of our allies around the world as a way to bring this to an end.\n\n\n\nOne of \u2014 look, the Israelis have every right to respond to the vicious attacks on them not just from the Iranians but from the \u2014 everyone from Hezbollah to the Houthis to \u2014 anyway. And \u2014 but the fact is that they have to be very much more careful about dealing with civilian casualties.\n\n\n\nQ So, how should they respond? You expressed concerns about attacks on Iranian oil facilities. How should they respond?\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: That\u2019s between me and them.\n\n\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: All right. We got to move on. Go ahead, Tam.\n\n\n\nQ The election is a month away. One, I\u2019d like to know how you\u2019re feeling about how this election is going. And then, also, do you have confidence that it will be a free and fair election and that it will be peaceful?\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Two separate questions.\n\n\n\nQ Very much.\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I\u2019m confident it\u2019ll be free and fair. I don\u2019t know whether it will be peaceful.\n\n\n\nThe things that Trump has said and the things that he said last time out when he didn\u2019t like the outcome of the election were very dangerous.\n\nIf you notice \u2014 I \u2014 I noticed that the vice-presidential Republican candidate did not say he\u2019d accept the outcome of the election. And they haven\u2019t even accepted the outcome of the last election. So, I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m concerned about what they\u2019re \u2014 what they\u2019re going to do.\n\n\n\nQ Are you making any preparations? Getting security briefings related to domestic security?\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I always get those briefings.\n\n\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: All right. We got to move on. Go ahead, Akayla. And we have \u2014 do a couple more.\n\n\n\nQ Hi. Hi, Mr. President. When are you considering imposing sanctions on Iran? And would you include oil in those sanctions?\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: That\u2019s som- \u2014 that\u2019s be- \u2014 that\u2019s under consideration right now, the whole thing. I\u2019m not going to discuss that out loud.\n\n\n\nQ And just on your comments yesterday on the port strike. You said by \u201cthe grace of God,\u201d it\u2019s going to hold. Is there any reason you think that this \u2014\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, there\u2019s more to do.\n\n\n\nQ \u2014 this temporary suspension \u2014\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: It\u2019s a month from now, and there\u2019s more to do in terms of everything from the whole notion of me- \u2014 me- \u2014 excuse me \u2014 mechanization of the ports and the like. There\u2019s more to more to re- \u2014 more to resolve.\n\n\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Go ahead, Danny.\n\n\n\nQ Thanks, Karine. Thank you, Mr. President. Last night, you said that there\u2019s still a lot to do to avoid an all-out war in the Middle East. I mean, firstly, aren\u2019t we pretty close to that definition already? And \u2014 and, secondly, what \u2014 what can you really do to stop that happening?\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDNET: There\u2019s a lot we are doing. The main thing we can do is try to rally the rest of the world and our allies into participating, like the French are, in \u2014 in Lebanon and other places to tamp this down. And \u2014 but when you have proxies as irrational as Hezbollah and the Houthis and \u2014 it\u2019s a \u2014 it\u2019s a hard thing to determine.\n\n\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Go ahead, Toluse.\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I\u2019ve got to go, kid.\n\n\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: I know. I know. (Laughter.) He\u2019s telling me, \u201cI got to go.\u201d\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I said I\u2019d take a couple questions. (Laughter.)\n\n\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: All right.\n\n\n\nQ We\u2019ll take (inaudible) \u2014\n\n\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: You\u2019re the la- \u2014 you\u2019re the last one, Toluse.\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I think she\u2019s decreasing her credibility. (Laughter.)\n\n\n\nQ First \u2014 first time in four years; you have to take some more.\n\n\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Toluse, you\u2019re going to be the last one.\n\n\n\nQ Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you for \u2014 for spending some time here with us. There have obviously been a number of crises that the country has been facing over the past several days with the hurricane, with port strike, with the situation in the Middle East. Can you talk about how your vice president, who is running for the presidency, has worked on these crises and what role she has played over the past several\n\ndays?\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, she\u2019s \u2014 I\u2019m in constant contact with her. She\u2019s aware of where \u2014 we all \u2014 we\u2019re singing from the same song sheet. We \u2014 she helped pass the l- \u2014 all the laws that are being employed now. She was a major player in everything we\u2019ve done, including passage of legislation, which we were told we could never pass. And so, she\u2019s been \u2014 and her \u2014 her staff is interlocked with mine in terms of all the things we\u2019re doing.\n\n\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: All right, sir. Thank you, sir.\n\n\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\n\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: It\u2019s up to you, sir. (Laughs.)\n\n\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\n\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Totally up to you, sir.\n\n\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\n\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: All right. All right. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead.\n\n\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\n\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah, Nandita. Nandita.\n\n\n\nSir \u2014 sir \u2014 no. No. Sir \u2014 I didn\u2019t call on you, sir. I didn\u2019t call on you. Nandita.\n\n\n\nQ Pope Francis is calling for a day of \u2014\n\nQ Thank you. Thank you, Karine.\n\n\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Nandita.\n\n\n\nQ \u2014 prayer \u2014\n\n\n\nQ Mr. President \u2014\n\n\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Go, Nandita.\n\n\n\nQ \u2014 and fasting. What\u2019s \u2014\n\n\n\nQ Mr. President \u2014\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: On Pope Francis \u2014\n\n\n\nQ Yeah.\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: \u2014 calling for a day of prayer and fasting \u2014\n\n\n\nQ A day of prayer and fasting this Monday, October 7th. You reaction, sir?\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I will prayer and fast.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: All right. That\u2019s \u2014\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\nQ Mr. President, what is acceptable to you in terms of Israel\u2019s response? How long are you okay with Israel bombing Lebanon? What is acceptable to you?\n\nQ Mr. President \u2014\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: All right, guys. That\u2019s it. Thank you, everybody.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, sir.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you.\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Thank you, every- \u2014 thank you, sir.\n\nQ Mr. President, on Ukraine. Have you made a decision on long-range weapons?\n\nQ Do you re- \u2014 want to reconsider dropping out of the race?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I\u2019m back in. (Laughter.)\n\nQ What made you want to come here today, Mr. President?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: All right, everybody.\n\nQ Thank \u2014 thank you, Mr. President.\n\nQ Thank you.\n\nQ Please come back.\n\nQ Thank you, Karine.\n\nQ Karine, can we do that again?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: No. (Laughter.)\n\nYou hear- \u2014 you heard I was already told that. (Laughs.)\n\nQ So, that\u2019s why we were late?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: I mean, are we always on \u2014 any \u2014 always on time? (Laughter.) I \u2014 I could call myself out for that.\n\nAll right, everybody. Thank you so much. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\nOkay. So, this week, the United States has faced a \u2014 a number of competing challenges, from tensions in the Middle East, to a port strike that threatened our nation\u2019s supply chains, to a historic hurricane that washed away entire communities.\n\nMoments like these underscore the importance of American leadership and resolve, and they show what is possible when we come together.\n\nUnder the leadership of President Biden and Vice President Harris, we were able to successfully protect our allies, ensure the viability of critical supplies, stand up for good-paying union jobs, and get resources to people impacted by the storm in North Carolina and beyond.\n\nIn the Middle East, the president showed that our ironclad support for Israelis\u2019 security is not just a talking point; it saves lives. Prior to Iran\u2019s attack on Israel, the president convened his national security team in the Situation Room to monitor developments in real time, ensure we were prepared to assist in Israelis\u2019 defense, and protect U.S. personnel in the region.\n\nUnder the president\u2019s leadership, the United States successfully defended Israel an- \u2014 from Iran\u2019s missiles, standing shoulder to shoulder with the people of Israel.\n\nOn the home front, the president and his team brought union workers, ocean carriers, and port operators to the table to \u2014 successfully to resolve a strike that threatened U.S. supply chains and the economic progress this president has made to lower prices for the American people.\n\nAnd in the Southwest United States \u2014 Southeast, pardon me, United States, the administration pre-positioned 1,500 federal personnel, along with critical resources like food, water, and fuel, to ensure that communities in the path of Hurricane Helene were prepared ahead of the storm.\n\nNow, we are getting more resources into the hardest-hit communities every day, and we have provided over $45 million directly to individuals and families to help them recover.\n\nAnd a wide range of bipartisan officials, including the governors of every affected state, are working together with us and have praised the federal response.\n\nThese response- \u2014 responses underscore why leadership matters. The president\u2019s leadership in this moment helps to save lives, pra- \u2014 protect critical alliances, and ensure that our economy remains strong. But more importantly, it proves that nothing is beyond America\u2019s capacity when we do it together.\n\nAnd really quickly, because I know you all a- \u2014 asked for this. This is the week ahead. Next week, the president will travel to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to discuss his administration\u2019s work to replace lead pipes in the state and across the country through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. This law is investing historic resources into our communities and creating good-paying jobs.\n\nThe president will also be traveling to Philadelphia for a campaign engagement.\n\nHe will also travel to Germany and Angola to underscore the enduring strength and importance of two strategic bilateral relationships in addressing a comprehensive range of global stra- \u2014 challenges. The value of strong alliances and partnerships in the defense of freedom and democracy has never resonated more in Europe, Africa, and beyond.\n\nPresident Biden has made revitalizing our international alliances and partnerships a key priority, recognizing that today\u2019s challenges require global perspectives and shared responses.\n\nThose are the details I am able to share with \u2014 for now, but certainly, we will have more in the upcoming days.\n\nAnd finally, n- \u2014 finally, we have Lael Bran- \u2014 Brai- \u2014 Brainard \u2014 (laughs) \u2014 our national economic adviser to the president. She\u2019s going to provide more information on how the president helped reopen our ports, as well as the strong job market economy report that we saw today, showing that more than 250,000 jobs this \u2014 this September under the president \u2014 President Biden.\n\nMS. BRAINARD: Well, thanks, Karine. And it\u2019s good to see everybody today.\n\nIt is a good day for American workers and families. We saw more than 250,000 new jobs created in the month of September. We saw unemployment back down to 4.1 percent at a time when inflation is back down to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nThe East Coast and Gulf ports are opening back up, and dockworkers are getting back to work on the basis of a strong tentative agreement on wages and a contract extension between the International Longshoreman\u2019s Association and the United St- \u2014 States Maritime Alliance.\n\nJust a week ago, the negotiation had totally stalled out. The union and employers had not spoken to each other for months. The last time a wage offer had been put on the table was in the middle of 2023.\n\nThe president and the vice president directed us to get the parties back to the table to reach a good deal. We worked around the clock to help them find common ground.\n\nAnd the president was clear throughout that process on three things: We needed to get the union and the employers back to the table on the basis of a strong progress on wages so nothing would get in the way of hurricane recovery; Taft-Hartley was off the table because collective bargaining works; and workers should share in the large profits of the ocean carriers, particularly after those dockworkers sacrificed so much to keep goods moving for the American public during the pandemic.\n\nAnd as a result of the hard work that I undertook along with Secretary Buttigieg, [Acting] Secretary Su, a number of people in the White House. We are seeing dockworkers get a fair share of the industry\u2019s record returns. We\u2019re seeing ports opening so consumers and businesses can get what they need. And we don\u2019t expect to see any effects on our economy or for consumers, businesses, and farmers because we have strong supply chains that we built in the wake of the pandemic.\n\nThe president and the vice president have consistently supported the collective bargaining process. When employers and workers come to the table, they find a good outcome.\n\nThat\u2019s a vastly different approach from previous administrations that might have busted unions and rolled back worker protections.\n\nAnd finally, I would simply say that the data that we\u2019re seeing, the data we saw last week confirms that our economy is delivering for workers.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: All right. I\u2019m going to take a couple of questions.\n\nGo ahead, Selina.\n\nQ Thank you so much for being here. Would you say at this point that the U.S. has achieved a soft landing? And if not, at what point will we be there?\n\nMS. BRAINARD: Yeah, I would say that, look, we have seen unemployment \u2014 the lowest average unemployment rate of any administration in 50 years, and we have seen inflation come back down to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nThat is exactly the kind of growth that you would want to see. Growth has actually been revised up. It\u2019s been above 3 percent over the last year, and we\u2019re continuing to see very resilient consumers. So, yes, that\u2019s exactly the kind of Goldilocks results that you would want to see.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Go ahead, Josh.\n\nQ Thanks again for doing this. If I could ask about an otherwise strong jobs report. You still have manufacturing employment dip by 7,000. What do you think is happening in the manufacturing sector right now? Is this response to higher rates, or are you seeing something else going on?\n\nMS. BRAINARD: Yeah, so I think if you look more broadly across the administration, you have seen manufacturing jobs growing by more than 700,000, in contrast to the previous administration that actually saw manufacturing job losses even before the pandemic.\n\nAnd I think the right way to think about this \u2014 because we have so much new investment dollars from the Investing in America agenda, the right way to think about it is to look at construction and manufacturing jobs together. And there, what we\u2019ve seen is continued growth.\n\nThat construction workforce is hard at work with factory construction that is multiples of the previous administrations. That construction of factories is going to turn into the manufacturing jobs of the future.\n\nSo, we see that investment in today\u2019s economy, whether it be in chip manufacturing or clean energy, that is going to result in tomorrow\u2019s manufacturing jobs.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Go ahead.\n\nQ Thank you, Karine.\n\nJust after the last Fed rate cut, do you think the administration has won its fight against inflation?\n\nMS. BRAINARD: So, I would say, if you look at the data on inflation, it is now back down to pre-pandemic levels. Don\u2019t forget, nobody said that could happen with a strong labor market. I think people just really need to go back and see some of the predictions. Nobody thought we could have the strongest recovery in our peer economies \u2014 strongest on jobs, strongest on growth \u2014 and get inflation down as fast as we did.\n\nAnd so, that just shows that the president\u2019s investments and the focus on supply chains has really worked.\n\nQ And then just a follow-up on the consumer confidence\n\nnumbers. I mean, there was, you know, an upward revision in August, but now it\u2019s down in September. I\u2019m just sort of wondering if you can comment on that.\n\nMS. BRAINARD: Yeah, so I think the most recent Michigan sentiment numbers actually are showing strength. And, you know, if you look at what consumers are talking about, they\u2019re talking about good jobs, good job opportunities. And we\u2019ve seen a lot of people moving into new sectors with better wages, and there is now a lot more confidence that interest rates are coming down, inflation is down, and that\u2019s going to enable consumers to feel more confident about investing in some of those bigger-ticket items.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: All right. Just a couple more.\n\nGo ahead.\n\nQ Thank you. On the jobs report, the data also showed that the employment picture in July and August was also brighter than previously thought. For Americans who are concerned about the rate that they may pay on their mortgage or their car that they might buy, what do you see that doing to the path of interest rates going forward?\n\nMS. BRAINARD: You know, I think that we are now in a part of the recovery where inflation is back down, and that\u2019s really what is going to determine whether interest rates continue to fall. And market interest rates have remained low. Mortgage rates have come all the way down close to 6 percent. We anticipate, because inflation is back down, that that will continue to show through to market rates.\n\nQ And on the hurricane that ravaged the Southeast, what are your early indications of how that could impact economic growth and the jobs picture in November, with so many in that region out of work?\n\nMS. BRAINARD: Yeah, so we do think normally with a hurricane of this size, with the devastation that it has caused in many communities, that it will affect the employment statistics for that month. But what we know is that, generally, you see the economy overall bouncing back very quickly and the growth numbers really becoming sort of strong pretty rapidly because of all that rebuilding activity that we are committed to.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Go ahead, Jacqui.\n\nQ That was my \u2014\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Oh, okay.\n\nQ \u2014 on interest rates. Yeah. (Laughter.)\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Go ahead.\n\nQ How concerned are you right now about the instability\n\nin the Middle East and its impact on oil prices?\n\nMS. BRAINARD: Yeah, so, it is something that we track very closely. Obviously, prices at the pump right now, $3.18 on average \u2014 not that I track it closely, but that is today\u2019s number \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 and below $3 in many states. We believe that global markets are well supplied, and continue to expect that in the U.S., we\u2019ll continue to see those low gas prices.\n\nAnd of course, we have really effective ways of addressing some of those geostrategic volatility. We\u2019ve used it in the past. We have the capacity to use it again.\n\nSo, right now, markets are very well supplied, and we anticipate them to remain so.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: All right, last question to \u2014 oh \u2014\n\nQ Yeah, I\u2019ll \u2014\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: No, I \u2014 I can go to Gerren too. (Laughs.) Go ahead.\n\nQ Thanks. A federal judge in Missouri issued an injunction blocking the president\u2019s student loan program hours after a judge in Georgia allowed it to advance. What is the White House\u2019s message to this dizzying legal battle? And that was lifted up as an economic policy to, particularly, closing the racial wealth gap. And what is your message to Black and brown Americans who are really relying on this relief?\n\n\n\nMS. BRAINARD: Yeah. So, student loan debt relief is so important for so many young people who are trying to build wealth, particularly for people who are first generation, to be able to invest in small businesses, to invest in starting a family, to invest in a house for the first time. So, we are going to continue to work to deliver that debt relief to so many students who deserve it.\n\n\n\nI do want to say that we have 5 million Americans who have already received debt relief. And, you know, you can go on TikTok and other social media platforms and see their testimonials what a difference it makes in their lives. And that is why the president, vice president going to continue working so hard to deliver.\n\n\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Awesome. Thank you so much, Lael.\n\nMS. BRAINARD: Thank you.\n\n\n\nQ More Americans are food insecure.\n\n\n\nMS. BRAINARD: Thank you.\n\n\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Thank you. Thank you so much.\n\n\n\nQ Could you address food insecurity?\n\n\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: I appreciate it.\n\n\n\nQ The numbers are rising \u2014\n\n\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Thank you, thank you.\n\n\n\nQ \u2014 according to the USDA. Food insecurity numbers?\n\n\n\nMaybe, Karine, if you could address it?\n\n\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: No. Not \u2014 not right now.\n\n\n\nQ Food insecurity?\n\n\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: I \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m not talking to you, sir.\n\n\n\nQ Okay.\n\n\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: I\u2019m just not. It would be nice if you would be less disrespectful in the room.\n\n\n\nQ I\u2019m just asking questions.\n\n\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Inappropriately.\n\n\n\nOkay. Go ahead, Josh. I don\u2019t know if \u2014 maybe you guys are done with me. Maybe I can walk out. (Laughs.) You guys got \u2014 you guys got all the best. (Laughs.) You guys got all the best.\n\n\n\nGo ahead, Josh.\n\n\n\nQ So, if we were to, like, zoom out \u2014\n\n\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah.\n\n\n\nQ \u2014 President Biden came in here today.\n\n\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah.\n\n\n\nQ He\u2019s going to be with Pennsylvania Senator Bob Casey this week. Then he goes to Germany and Angola. He said he\u2019s singing from the same song sheet as vice president Kamala Harris on the campaign. How does he see his public role in the next few weeks as we get closer to the election? What does \u2014 what\u2019s he trying to achieve?\n\n\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: I \u2014 look \u2014\n\n\n\nQ And how\u2019s he thinking about it?\n\n\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: I think he\u2019s doing his job as president, right? I think that\u2019s the most important thing. I mean, I started off at the top, at least of this \u2014 this part of the program, where I said that we\u2019ve had three major events happen this week. And what did the president do? What did the vice president do? They worked shoulder and shoulder to deal with these major events.\n\n\n\nNow we see a deal with the port \u2014 a negotiated deal with the ports. Obviously, it \u2014 it \u2014 that collective bargaining is extended until January 15th, which is incredibly important, especially in the midst of a hurricane that we saw \u2014 this historic hurricane that we just saw \u2014 Hurricane Helene.\n\n\n\nWe s- \u2014 we see what\u2019s happening in the Middle East. The president and the vice president continue to have diplomatic conversations, if you will, to deal \u2014 to de-escalate, to deal with what we\u2019re seeing in \u2014 in that \u2014 in the region.\n\n\n\nAnd the hurricane. You saw the \u2014 the vice president in \u2014 in Georgia; the president in North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, himself, and also in North \u2014 also in Florida, pardon me.\n\n\n\nAnd so, I think what you\u2019re going to see is him continuing to do his job, working closely with the vice president.\n\n\n\nLook, before Hurricane Helene, President Biden was planning to campaign this week, and you heard \u2014 you heard me say he\u2019s going to go to Pennsylvania. He\u2019s going to go to Wisconsin next week. And so, we have \u2014 you know, we \u2014 we have \u2014 you all have covered how much of a whirlwind week this has been.\n\n\n\nAnd so, the president is going to be president. He\u2019s going to be commander in chief. And obviously, he\u2019s going to be supporting his vice president.\n\n\n\nI can\u2019t speak specifically about the campaign because of \u2014 we do respect the Hatch Act here \u2014 at least for myself, as a federal employee, and many of us here.\n\n\n\nAnd so, look, he\u2019s going to continue to \u2014 to do the work that he\u2019s doing. We saw strong jobs numbers. That\u2019s one of the reasons he came out. He came out because he wanted to talk about that. He wanted to talk about what we have seen this week.\n\n\n\nAnd so \u2014 and so, look, we\u2019re going to continue to doing the work, and I think that\u2019s what the American people want to see.\n\n\n\nGo ahead, Selina.\n\n\n\nQ Thanks, Karine. So, former President Donald Trump threatened to revoke the legal status of Haitian migrants.\n\nWhat is the president\u2019s reaction to that? This is something that the former president had tried to do during his own administration.\n\n\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Look, here\u2019s the fact. The fact is they are here legally, right? That is the fact. TPS, that\u2019s what it gives you. And honestly, I wouldn\u2019t take legal advice from the former president. I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s not something I would do.\n\n\n\nGo ahead.\n\n\n\nQ And how concerned is the administration about the economic impact of Hurricane Helene?\n\n\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Look, as you can see, we have been working around the clock. The president directed his team very early on to work around the clock to make sure that the states who were \u2014 that were affected, the states that he\u2019s visited and the vice president has visited over the past couple of days, got everything that they need. And we \u2014 and we did that by pre-positioning \u2014 pre-positioning some of the personnel \u2014 about 1,500 federal personnel \u2014 to do that.\n\n\n\nWhat we are doing: We\u2019re going to make sure \u2014 obviously, we\u2019re going to always monitor any of the economic impact. But we\u2019re going to continue to make sure that we are dealing \u2014 we are focused on lifesaving and life-sustaining efforts. That\u2019s the focus that we\u2019re going to have here.\n\n\n\nAnd we\u2019re going to continue to monitor. But obviously, reacting and providing the needs of the states right now, of the \u2014 of citizens who are living in those states is probably the most key and most important. And continue to call on Congress to move forward with additional funding.\n\nAs you know, in the CR there was a robust ask for funding \u2014 for disaster funding, and that didn\u2019t make it in the bipartisan CR. And so, we got to get that done. And we\u2019re going to continue to have conversations with Congress.\n\n\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Go ahead, Nandita.\n\n\n\nQ Karine, I tried asking the president this \u2014\n\n\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Nandita, I\u2019ve called on you, like, three times today. (Laughter.) I know some folks in the back are just going to be like, \u201cYeah.\u201d\n\n\n\nQ I appreciate it. I appreciate it.\n\n\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So \u2014 yeah.\n\n\n\nQ I tried asking President Biden \u2014\n\n\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: (Laughs.)\n\n\n\nQ (Inaudible.)\n\n\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: I hear you, Kimberly. I hear you.\n\n\n\nGo ahead.\n\n\n\nQ What is acceptable to the U.S. in terms of Israel\u2019s response, right? How long is the U.S. comfortable with Israel bombing Lebanon?\n\n\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: I \u2014 I know you guys are going to ask this question every which way, and I totally understand that. We are having conversations, discussions. We\u2019re in contact with the Israelis on \u2014 on what\u2019s next.\n\nWe have been very clear there will be consequences. You saw the joint statement with the G7. There\u2019s going to be consequences. There\u2019s going to be sanctions. And I\u2019m not going to preview those sanctions from here.\n\n\n\nBut we have always said Israel has the right to defend itself. And we \u2014 and you saw just on Tuesday night \u2014 and not just Tuesday night, in April \u2014 how \u2014 how much we are prepared to defend and protect Israel, because that is our ironclad commitment.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m not going to get into pu- \u2014 into diplomatic conversations in \u2014 in the public here.\n\nQ And there was a report that quotes U.S. officials saying the White House wants to take advantage of the massive blow to Hezbollah\u2019s leadership and infrastructure to push for a new Lebanese president in the coming days. Can you comment on that?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: I\u2019m not going to comment on that. I\u2019m not going to comment on sources or reporting out there. That is \u2014 that is not something I\u2019m going to speak to, sourcing that I can\u2019t even verify from here.\n\nGo ahead.\n\nQ Thank you. On the port strike reaching a tentative agreement. The White House and several officials were involved in \u2014 in the 90-day extension of those talks. I\u2019m wondering what the significance of that timeline is and whether the election being five weeks away played any role in it?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Look, this is about the right thing to do for workers. Many of those workers put their lives at risk during the pandemic. We have always said collective bargaining is \u2014 works. We believe it works. And we have seen \u2014 we have seen parties reach a fair agreement when you put \u2014 when you have \u2014 when they come in \u2014 come to the table and \u2014 in good faith and do that collective bargaining. This is what\u2019s important.\n\nIt was important to this president to get this done. This is not about an election. This is about what is the right thing to do for the American people. This is the right thing to do for \u2014 for workers, again, who \u2014 who deserve higher wages, who deserve benefits.\n\nAnd so, the president is proud to have been able to do that. His team \u2014 obviously, with his team, in the dir- \u2014 and he directed his team to do this. And so, now collective bargaining is going to continue, and we\u2019ll see where we are in the next couple of \u2014 couple of months.\n\nBut this is not about politics for this president. He \u2014 and you have seen that in the last three and a half years when we\u2019ve been in these types of situation where there was negotiation, and we have been very, very clear: collective bargaining and supporting workers.\n\nQ On congressional funding. You mentioned some of the items that were lacking in the short-term funding bill that Republicans had put forth. I\u2019m wondering if the president has spoken with any members of the Big Four in Congress to bring those concerns to them directly.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, I don\u2019t have any conversations to speak to that the president has had with members of Congress.\n\nI mean, you saw him on the road. He was able \u2014 you saw him in a bipartisan way on the road in North Carolina, South Carolina, in Georgia, and \u2014 and Florida. And he \u2014 you saw him with Republican congressional members and governors and Republican \u2014 and Democratic congressional members and also governors. And you saw that bipartisanship.\n\nI\u2019m certainly not going to get into any private conversations that they have had. But we will continue to speak to congressional leadership and members about getting that extra funding. It is important. They need to act. They need to act.\n\nAIDE: Karine, you (inaudible).\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Go ahead. Go ahead.\n\nQ Hey, thanks, Karine. Can you talk about how President Biden will be marking Monday\u2019s one-year anniversary of the October 7th attack on Israel?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, obviously, it\u2019s going to be a painful \u2014 a painful day for \u2014 for many, including for \u2014 for all of us here. And so, we will have more to share on how we will be commemorating that devastating day that we saw a year ago. Don\u2019t have anything to share at this time.\n\nQ And \u2014 and, secondly, this was President Biden\u2019s first time \u2014 correct? \u2014 to the press briefing room \u2014\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah.\n\nQ \u2014 since he\u2019s \u2014\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yep.\n\nQ What \u2014 why not \u2014\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: And you\u2019re welcome.\n\nQ Yeah.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: You\u2019re welcome. I know you\u2019re \u2014 I know this \u2014\n\nQ I know. I know.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: I know the way \u2014 the way this question is going to go.\n\nQ We appreciate it. I \u2014\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: It\u2019s going to be great. It\u2019s going to be great. (Laughs.)\n\nQ Let\u2019s \u2014 let\u2019s do it again.\n\nQ I would have preferred a further question, but that\u2019s all \u2014 that\u2019s all right. (Laughter.) But real quick: Why not \u2014 why didn\u2019t he come in the three and a half years before?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: I \u2014\n\nQ Why \u2014\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: I mean, he came today. And you got to see him.\n\nQ Yes. Yeah, but \u2014\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: And you were here.\n\nQ \u2014 you know, I mean, he had the opportunity \u2014\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Aw, man. Come on.\n\nQ All right. All right.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Come on. He was here. He took your questions. And he \u2014\n\nQ It seemed like he wanted to stay a little bit longer.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: I \u2014 (laughter) \u2014\n\nQ Every Friday?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: He is \u2014 he is \u2014 every Friday? (Laughter.) Friday \u2014 Friday with the POTUS. Friday with the POTUS. We \u2014\n\nQ I\u2019ll bring ice cream. Bring ice cream.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Well, no, you guys got to bring the ice cream. You guys got to bring the ice cream.\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\nOkay. I\u2019m going to do a couple more. Go ahead. I haven\u2019t called on you. Go ahead. Go ahead.\n\nQ Thank you, Karine. I want to go back to Haitians and the TPS. But first, you know, it was \u2014 it\u2019s another week of misery in Haiti.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah.\n\nQ There was this report from the World Food Programme describing acute hunger. What more can the U.S. do to improve the situation in Haiti? And conc- \u2014 if there\u2019s no improvement, is it conceivable that the TPS for Haitians will never be lifted?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, look, on your last question, I\u2019ll do that first \u2014 the last part of your question, I\u2019ll do that first. I \u2014 we \u2014 I can\u2019t predetermine what TPS status is going to be. It\u2019s not something that I can do from here. Obviously, as you know, that is a decision with DHS and the State Department. They decide TPS and the best way to move forward. So, I\u2019m not going to get into a hypothetical about that.\n\nBut as it relates to Haiti more broadly and to the question of instability and what\u2019s happening, look, despite that \u2014 despite the instability that continues, the recent deployment, as you know, of MSS mission is a unique opportunity to build a foundation of security and bring hope to Haitians that deserve to live their lives free of violence.\n\nAnd so, to that end, the United States has delivered well over $300 million to support the MSS mission, while urging the international to community \u2014 community to support that \u2014 that mission as well. The United States will continue to hold those undermining Haiti\u2019s institutions and committing serious human rights abuses accountable. That is our commitment.\n\nWe are committed to doing our part both to address immediate security needs and invest in Haiti\u2019s long-term successes. We stand with the people of Haiti and will continue supporting their aspirations of more security, certainly democratic and prosperous future. That is our commitment, and we\u2019ll continue to support the mission.\n\nGo ahead, Michael.\n\nQ Thanks, Karine. It seems as if the president has spoken with pretty much every governor in the affected \u2014\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: He has. He has. That was affected in the region.\n\nQ But has he spoken with Governor DeSantis of Florida?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Touch\u00e9. Good point. So \u2014 (laughter). Touch\u00e9.\n\nSo \u2014 and I think we read out that he spoke to the governor of Tennessee on our way back from \u2014 back from our trip to Florida and Georgia yesterday.\n\nI don\u2019t have a \u2014 a conversation to read out with the Florida \u2014 the governor of Florida. But what I can say is that we have been in touch. Our team has been in touch with local officials on the ground. We are committed to providing what is needed in the state, obviously, to those who were affected in the state, and are committed \u2014 our commitment is clear. The president has always said it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re in a red state or a blue state; he\u2019s a president for all Americans. And that\u2019s \u2014 continues to be, certainly, his commitment.\n\nGo ahead.\n\nAIDE: Last one.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: I know. I\u2019m getting \u2014 I\u2019m getting pulled. But go ahead. Then I\u2019ll come back to you.\n\nQ Thank you, Karine. The president seemed to suggest that he is asking \u2014 or he seems to be suggesting that Israel should consider other alternatives, rather than attacking Iranian oil facilities. But should Israel make such an attack, how is the administration preparing for an Iranian retaliation on the Strait of Hormuz that would disrupt oil supply and disrupt oil prices globally?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, also as the president said, we continue to have these discussions. I\u2019m not going to get into hypotheticals Israel \u2014 about Israel\u2019s response to Tues- \u2014 Tuesday \u2014 Tuesday night attacks.\n\nWhat I will say is that we understand that they are still determining what exactly they will do. That is something that we understand.\n\nI\u2019m just not going to prejudge. I\u2019m not going to get ahead of anything, and the discussions to continue.\n\nQ But can we say that the administration is preparing for that possibility?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: I \u2014 I\u2019m just not going to get \u2014 I\u2019m not going to speculate. They\u2019re still \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m telling you, they\u2019re \u2014 still haven\u2019t decided what their next steps are going to be.\n\nQ Okay.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying to you. That\u2019s what we understand. I don\u2019t have anything else beyond that.\n\nQ And on Angola \u2014 on the President\u2019s trip, Karine. Amnesty International is criticizing the administration\u2019s, quote, \u201csilence\u201d on human rights violations in Angola ahead of the president\u2019s visit, calling out the administration\u2019s focus on private-sector investment to counter China. This is obviously in reference to the Lobito Corridor. Do you have a response?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Look, I mean, I \u2014 we get this question \u2014 this type of question about human rights violations any time he meets, he travels and if that\u2019s going to come up. The president, as you know, has never shied away from direct conversation about human rights and democracy in any conversation, and I could expect that he will do the same in this upcoming trip.\n\nAnd so, I don\u2019t have anything beyond that, but the president has never shied away from that. Never shied away.\n\nGo ahead.\n\nQ Thank you, Karine. Does the administration have any concerns about how the \u2014 the aftermath of this storm could impact the vote, whether it\u2019s talking to the Postal Service about mail-in ballots that may not be getting to people or impacting the infrastructure in these critical states?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, look, we are go- \u2014 using every available resources to help this com- \u2014 the community respond. That\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do and recover from this disaster. That is our commitment. That\u2019s what you\u2019ve heard from this president. That\u2019s what you heard from the FEMA administrator and so many others in the president\u2019s administration, and certainly that means ensuring that Americans\u2019 have \u2014 voices are heard this November. And so, that is our commitment. We want to make sure that people\u2019s voices are heard.\n\nAnd so, any specifics on where the infrastructure is and what that looks like, certainly, I would have to refer you to the state election officials on \u2014 on those and \u2014 and cybersecurity and infrastructure and all of those pieces \u2014 on what that looks like for them. But \u2014 but \u2014\n\nQ Have any of the states voiced concerns to the administration?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: I \u2014 well, I cannot speak to that. I have not heard of that.\n\nBut look, our commitment, again, is to make sure that the resources available so that community can respond to recovery and also get back on their feet and deal with this disaster. We want to make sure \u2014 we want to make sure that Americans\u2019 voices are heard this \u2014 this November.\n\nThat is im- \u2014 important and so \u2014 but certainly that is something that state elected officials can speak to more directly, but we\u2019re going to try and make sure they get back on \u2014 back on that.\n\nAnd I haven\u2019t called on you yet. Go ahead.\n\nQ Thank you.\n\nQ Former President Trump is accusing the Biden administration of using FEMA funding to support undocumented migrants. How is the White House responding to that?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: I mean, it\u2019s just categorically fla- \u2014 false. It is not true. It is a false statement. And look, the fact of the matter is \u2014 I think the Washington Post fact-checker did a piece and the headline recently, just moments ago, not too long ago, and the headline was \u201cNo, Biden didn\u2019t take FEMA relief money to use \u2014 to use on migrants \u2013 but Trump did.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ll leave it there.\n\nQ And a quick follow-up \u2014\n\nQ Karine? Karine?\n\nQ \u2014 on that? A follow on \u2014\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yep. Yep. Yep.\n\nQ Secretary Mayorkas had said earlier this week that he was concerned that FEMA didn\u2019t have enough funding until the end \u2014 for the rest of the hurricane season. Now that President Biden has seen the damage firsthand in the Carolinas, Florida, Georgia \u2014 we heard him say at the podium he may have to call Congress back from recess \u2014 what exactly is he waiting for to be able to make that call?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: I \u2014 look, here\u2019s the thing: We put forth a pretty substantial, robust \u2014 I mentioned this moments ago \u2014 to be part of the CR. We were disappointed that it was not part of the CR. And if congressional Republicans were serious \u2014 if they were really, truly serious \u2014 about doing something for the communities that was impacted by Hurricane Helene, they would join us in calling for additional funding. This is what we\u2019ve been doing. And so, if they\u2019re serious, they would get to \u2014 to work and get that done.\n\nJust like in the \u2014 with the border, if they were serious about the border, they wouldn\u2019t vote against their own bipartisan proposal that they worked with us on \u2014 they\u2019re against it now; they weren\u2019t \u2014 they would move it forward. It would actually start fixing the broken system that we\u2019re seeing right now.\n\nAnd, you know, they can \u2014 if they really want to help us in dealing what we\u2019re seeing, whether it\u2019s at the border or getting more funding for disaster monies that\u2019s going to be needed to get into the communities, they should be serious. Congressional Republicans need to get serious here, and they\u2019re just not.\n\nGo ahead, Akayla.\n\nQ Thanks, Karine. Just a quick question on the port strike suspension. Is the White House going to continue to be in touch with ILA to sort of support those negotiations as they continue?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: I think, look, there\u2019s congressional \u2014 congressional \u2014 collective bargaining continues. I think that\u2019s really important. That\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing, and that\u2019s what we want to continue to see. And so, we will be in touch as necessary.\n\nBut I think what\u2019s important is they came up with an agreement. That\u2019s because of this president\u2019s leadership. And the way to get this done is getting col- \u2014 is continuing that collective bargaining, and we believe that certainly works.\n\nThanks, everybody. All right. Have a great weekend.\n\nQ Thank you.\n\n2:55 P.M. EDT",

Harris earned her highest national polling average since July, though the presidential race remains extremely close in battleground states .",
        "text": "Harris and Trump neck-and-neck in polls with early voting under way\nMore than 1.4 million people have now voted in the presidential election, as Kamala Harris and Donald Trump continue to crisscross the country in the final stretch of a neck-and-neck campaign.\n\nTheir vice-presidential picks, JD Vance and Tim Walz, also faced off this week in the only vice-presidential debate of this cycle. But initial polls suggested voters saw the debate as a draw, without clear impact on the race.\n\nHarris earned her highest national polling average since July, though the presidential race remains extremely close in battleground states, according to the Guardian\u2019s poll tracker. Harris is leading in five of seven swing states, according to the Guardian\u2019s average of high-quality state polls aggregated by the polling analysis platform 538 over the last 10 days. But overall, both candidates continue to have about even odds of winning.\n\nThe Guardian\u2019s tracker shows Harris with 49.3% of the vote nationally, compared with 46% for Trump. Early voting is already under way and more than 1.4 million Americans had voted as of midday Friday, according to data collected by the Election Lab at the University of Florida.\n\nHarris retains a slight lead, similar to the Guardian\u2019s analysis last week. But the numbers have yet to reflect the vice-presidential debate.\n\nThe simplest path to winning the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency continues to be winning the battleground states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. While Harris leads Trump in the 10-day average of polls in all three, according to the Guardian\u2019s analysis (Pennsylvania by 1.2 points, Michigan by 0.1 point, and Wisconsin by 2.2 points), those advantages aren\u2019t significant enough to say who will win, analysts say.\n\nThe race is similarly close in the four other battleground states, Nevada, North Carolina, Georgia, and Arizona.\n\n\u201cNo candidate enjoys a significant lead in states worth the 270 electoral votes needed to win,\u201d Nate Cohn, the polling analyst for the New York Times, wrote in his weekly newsletter. \u201cThis might be the clearest read we\u2019ve had of the race so far. It was arguably the first \u2018quiet\u2019 week since Vice-President Harris\u2019s entry into the race.\u201d\n\nOne slight exception may be in Pennsylvania, Cohn wrote. Polls showed Harris leading in the state by about 2 points after the 10 September debate, but now the race there was essentially tied, he wrote.\n\nThe Guardian\u2019s tracker is based on an average of high quality polls over the last 10 days compiled by 538. As of Friday, the forecasting site said the race was essentially a toss-up, with Harris having a 55% chance of winning and Trump having a 45% chance.\n\nSome of Trump\u2019s best polling has been in Arizona \u2013 he leads Harris there 48.8% to 48%, according to the Guardian\u2019s state poll tracker. Some of that advantage may have to do with his support among Hispanic voters, Cohn wrote.\n\nWhen Joe Biden won Arizona in 2020, he carried Latino voters by nearly 25 points. Four high-quality polls released this week showed Harris leading among Hispanic voters by no more than 12 points, Cohn noted. A national poll from NBC News/Telemundo/CNBC found Harris leading among Hispanic voters 54%-40%. Biden won 59% of the Hispanic vote in 2020.\n\n\u201cMr Trump\u2019s strength among Hispanic voters this cycle might seem surprising, but four years ago he made big gains among them across the country,\u201d Cohn wrote. \u201cAnd in 2016, he fared no worse than Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 showing among them, even though his anti-immigration rhetoric created the expectation of a significant backlash. In retrospect, his resilience among Hispanic voters in 2016 looks like a harbinger of what was to come.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Stakes \u2014 Presidential Transition Free newsletter We will guide you through the aftermath of the US election and the transition to a Trump presidency Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A Pew analysis found Biden won college-educated Hispanic voters 69% to 30% in 2020. But among non-college educated Hispanics, he won a much narrower 55% to 41%.\n\nRecent polling from the non-partisan Cook Political Report also found that the race was essentially tied. But its analysis did show some good signs for Harris.\n\nA plurality of voters now think Harris will win the election, with 46% saying so compared to 39% for Trump.\n\n\u201cThat represents an 11-point swing in Harris\u2019s favor since August, and suggests that Harris has been successful in presenting herself as a serious candidate, while Trump\u2019s attempts to portray her as unable to do the job have not been effective,\u201d Amy Walter and Jessica Taylor, two of the site\u2019s editors, wrote in an analysis.\n\nThere were also some encouraging signs for Harris on the economy, the Cook Political Report found. While Trump continues to lead among voters who believe he is better equipped to handle the economy, voters are evenly split on who would be better to get inflation under control. In August, Trump had a 48%-42% advantage on the issue.\n\nThe shift might reflect that Harris\u2019s messaging on the economy is breaking through to voters, Walter and Taylor wrote. It could also suggest that Trump hasn\u2019t been successful in linking Harris to the rising cost of living, they said.",

No. Here is what you should know\n\ntoggle caption Saul Loeb/Getty Images\n\nWith less than 35 days until Election Day and with early voting taking place across the U.S., many Americans are questioning the secrecy of their ballots.\n\nElection officials, voter registration organizations and election law experts \u2014 including New Mexico Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver \u2014 have been fielding these questions from Americans.\n\nToulouse Oliver addressed concerns over ballot privacy for voters in a social media post, citing a study released in April that found 70% of New Mexico voters believe a person can find out someone's vote choices without their consent.\n\nNo one can find out whom someone voted for without their consent.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nTappan Vickery, senior director of programming and strategy for HeadCount, a voter registration organization, said they also receive questions on ballot privacy.\n\nVickery said news coverage surrounding election observers in recent years and Americans becoming more conscious about what information is available online are a few factors driving concerns over ballot privacy. Another one is today's political climate.\n\n\"Hyperpartisanship and the anger that is driving a lot of the partisanship in our country right now makes people feel afraid sometimes for having their own opinions and in spaces where they don't feel like they're welcome,\" Vickery said.\n\nThe concern over ballot privacy has also extended to personal relationships. Olivia Dreizen Howell, co-founder of Fresh Starts Registry, an organization that helps people start over after a major life change, said she has received questions from women on whether their partner could find out whom they voted for.\n\n\"For many women, especially in this election, with so many critical topics on the table, they may choose to vote across their registered party lines for Kamala Harris \u2014 and this may be the first time they have made this decision \u2014 and it may be going against what their husband is doing voting-wise,\" Dreizen Howell said.\n\nHere is what you should know about privacy and casting a ballot.\n\n\n\nSo \u2026 is whom I vote for really a secret?\n\nWhom you vote for is not public; the only way someone will know exactly whom you vote for is by telling them.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nVoting secretly is a cornerstone of democracy, and the secret ballot dates back to the late 1800s, election law experts told NPR.\n\n\"In every state, voters have the right to a secret ballot either in the state constitution or a state statute. So when you go to vote, your name is not associated with your ballot. The ballot is anonymous. When it is tabulated, it won't be connected back to you,\" Michael Morse, an assistant law professor at the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School, told NPR.\n\nWhile whom you cast your ballot for is a secret, some of your voter information may be available to the public, depending on where you live.\n\nYour name, address and party affiliation all may be included on voter registration lists known as voter rolls. Morse said these lists are public records and may show the last election you participated in. Campaigns also can gather data from these lists over time and use it when canvassing. And while certain information regarding your voter information is public record, Morse said other information you submit, such as your Social Security number and driver's license number, are not public.\n\ntoggle caption Stephen Maturen/Getty Images\n\nIf you donate to a candidate or political campaign, how much you give and where you work may also be public, depending on how much money you donate. The Federal Election Commission has a public database of individual contributions to campaigns and candidates.\n\nThis information may give people clues about how you voted, but it still does not show whom you voted for.\n\nYour ballot is also secret if you vote by mail. If you vote by mail, you can cast your vote in a private setting, and when your ballot is received by an election official, it is still private.\n\n\"Even in states where they're going through a mail-in ballot, those envelopes are secure until they're tabulated,\" Vickery said. \"So, it's not like the folks who are receiving the ballot see your name and see who you voted for. There are secrecy sleeves.\"\n\n\n\nSponsor Message\n\nWhy is some of my voter information public? What can I do if I want it all private?\n\nElection administration includes a mix of both voter privacy and public transparency, Morse said.\n\n\"You should not be concerned that your vote choice will be disclosed, but there must be some amount of public transparency too, for confidence in the process,\" he said. For example, he said that \"whether you are registered to vote, whether you participated in the past or if you gave certain campaign contributions will typically be public, not private.\"\n\nThere are options, depending on where you live, that will allow you to limit how much of your voter information is public. Many states have an \"address confidentiality program\" for victims of domestic violence, human trafficking or sexual assault and those in fear for their safety, according to the U.S. Election Assistance Commission.\n\nIn states such as Alaska and Nevada, voters can request in writing that their residential address or phone number not be open to the public. Law enforcement officers, judges and others in certain professions may also have certain information removed from public databases.\n\nThere are also federal and state laws that protect voters and their privacy when they cast a ballot and that prevent election officials from disclosing your information.\n\n\"No election observer should be looking over your shoulder to see who you're voting for. If that is happening, you should report it because that is not legal,\" Vickery said.\n\nWhile whom you vote for is anonymous, consider the privacy policies at the place where you register to vote regarding the public disclosure of some of your voter information.\n\n\"Just make sure that the privacy policy holds up with your comfort level of how the data is being used and how we're in touch with people,\" Vickery said.",

        "text": "Kamala Harris maintains narrow lead in key states in US presidential race\nThe United States presidential election will be held on November 5. In analyst Nate Silver\u2019s aggregate of national polls, Democrat Kamala Harris leads Republican Donald Trump by 49.3\u201346.2, a slight gain for Trump since last Monday, when Harris led Trump by 49.3\u201346.0.\n\nJoe Biden\u2019s final position before his withdrawal as Democratic candidate on July 21 was a national poll deficit against Trump of 45.2\u201341.2.\n\nIn economic data, the US added 254,000 jobs in September and the unemployment rate slid 0.1% to 4.1%. The unemployment rate had peaked at 4.3% in July.\n\nThe US president isn\u2019t elected by the national popular vote, but by the Electoral College, in which each state receives electoral votes equal to its federal House seats (population based) and senators (always two). Almost all states award their electoral votes as winner-takes-all, and it takes 270 electoral votes to win (out of 538 total).\n\nRelative to the national popular vote, the Electoral College is biased to Trump, with Harris needing at least a two-point popular vote win to be the Electoral College favourite in Silver\u2019s model.\n\nIn the key states, Harris remains ahead in Silver\u2019s poll aggregates by one to two points in Pennsylvania (19 electoral votes), Michigan (15), Wisconsin (ten) and Nevada (six). If Harris wins these four states, she probably wins the Electoral College by at least 276\u2013262. Trump leads by 0.5 points in North Carolina (16 electoral votes), one point in Georgia (16) and 1.2 points in Arizona (11).\n\nRead more: Kamala Harris the slight favourite to win US election as she narrowly leads in key states\n\nIn Silver\u2019s model, Harris has a 56% chance to win the Electoral College, unchanged since last Monday\u2019s article. The FiveThirtyEight model was more favourable to Harris in September, but now gives her a 55% chance to win. It\u2019s close to a 50\u201350 probability for either candidate, but Harris remains a slight favourite.\n\nThere are still more than four weeks to go until the election, so there\u2019s time for the polls to change and for one candidate to have a decisive Electoral College advantage on election day. Or the polls could be understating either Harris or Trump, in which case the candidate that benefits from the poll error could have a decisive win.\n\nThumping lead for LNP in Queensland\n\nThe Queensland state election is on October 26. A Freshwater poll for The Financial Review, conducted September 26\u201329 from a sample of 1,067, gave the Liberal National Party (LNP) a 56\u201344 lead, a five-point gain for the LNP since the previous Freshwater poll in July 2023.\n\nPrimary votes were 43% LNP (up three), 30% Labor (down four), 12% Greens (up one), 8% One Nation (up one) and 7% for all Others (down one).\n\nLabor Premier Steven Miles had a net approval of -5, while LNP leader David Crisafulli had a +15 net approval. Crisafulli led Miles by 46\u201338 as preferred premier.\n\nThe poll asked about the federal leaders\u2019 Queensland ratings, with Anthony Albanese at net -17, while Peter Dutton was at net zero. Queensland is a Coalition-friendly state at federal elections relative to the national results.\n\nFederal Newspoll quarterly data\n\nOn September 30, The Australian released aggregate data for the four Newspolls taken from July to September, which had a combined sample size of 5,035. The Poll Bludger said the Coalition led in New South Wales by 51\u201349, unchanged on the June quarter.\n\nIn Victoria, Labor led by 52\u201348, a two-point gain for the Coalition. In Queensland, the Coalition led by an unchanged 54\u201346. In Western Australia, Labor led by an unchanged 52\u201348. In South Australia, Labor led by 54\u201346, a one-point gain for Labor.\n\nThe Poll Bludger\u2019s BludgerTrack data shows the results by educational attainment. In the September quarter, Labor led by 53\u201347 among university-educated people, a one-point gain for Labor. With TAFE-educated people, there was a 50\u201350 tie, a one-point gain for the Coalition. Those with no tertiary education favoured the Coalition by 51\u201349, a one-point gain for the Coalition.\n\nCoalition gains lead in Morgan poll\n\nA national Morgan poll, conducted September 23\u201329 from a sample of 1,668, gave the Coalition a 51\u201349 lead, a 1.5-point gain for the Coalition since the September 16\u201322 Morgan poll.\n\nPrimary votes were 38% Coalition (up 0.5), 30% Labor (down two), 13.5% Greens (up one), 4.5% One Nation (down 0.5), 9.5% independents (steady) and 4.5% others (up one).\n\nThe headline figure uses respondent preferences. But if preferences were assigned using the 2022 election flows, Labor led by 51.5\u201348.5, a 0.5-point gain for the Coalition. There was an unusually large gap last week between the two measures.\n\nResolve poll on Middle East conflict\n\nVoting intentions have not yet been released from a national Resolve poll for Nine newspapers that was conducted October 1\u20135 from a sample of 1,606. Regarding the political response in Australia to the Middle East conflict, 22% thought Dutton and the Liberals had responded best, 18% Albanese and Labor and 6% Adam Bandt and the Greens, while 55% said none had responded best or were unsure.\n\nOn Australia\u2019s actions, 23% thought we should voice in-principle support for Israel, 12% Gaza and 65% both or none. On accepting refugees, 52% don\u2019t want any refugees accepted, 24% would accept refugees from either Israel or Gaza, 13% Gaza only and 11% Israel only.",

Musk said \u201cthis will be the last election\u201d if Trump doesn\u2019t win. Wearing a cap with the \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d slogan of Trump\u2019s campaign, Musk appeared to acknowledge the foreboding nature of his remarks.\n\nREAD MORE: Butler still struggles with aftermath of assassination attempt ahead of Trump\u2019s return\n\n\u201cAs you can see I am not just MAGA \u2014 I am Dark MAGA,\u201d he said.\n\nIt was the first time that Musk joined one of Trump\u2019s rallies and was evidence of their growing alliance in the final stretch of the presidential election. Musk created a super political action committee supporting the Republican nominee and it has been spending heavily on get-out-the-vote efforts. Trump has said he would tap Musk to lead a government efficiency commission if he regains the White House.\n\nTrump joined Musk in August for a rare public conversation on X, a friendly chat that spanned more than two hours. In it, the former president largely focused on the July assassination attempt, illegal immigration and his plans to cut government regulations.\n\nBefore a large crowd Saturday, Musk sought to portray Trump as a champion of free speech, arguing that Democrats want \u201cto take away your freedom of speech, they want to take away your right to bear arms, they want to take away your right to vote, effectively.\u201d Musk went on to criticize a California effort to ban voter ID requirements.\n\nThe event took place at the same property where a gunman\u2019s bullets grazed Trump\u2019s right ear and killed a Trump supporter, Corey Comperatore. The shooting left multiple others injured.\n\nTrump picked up where he left off in July when a gunman\u2019s bullet struck his ear. He began his speech with, \u201cAs I was saying,\u201d and gestured toward an immigration chart he was looking at when the gunfire began.\n\nREAD MORE: Fact-checking Trump\u2019s claims about Helene, immigration and the economy at his Butler rally\n\n\u201cTwelve weeks ago, we all took a bullet for America,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAll we are all asking is that everyone goes out and votes. We got to win. We can\u2019t let this happen to our country.\u201d\n\nThe Trump campaign worked to maximize the event\u2019s headline-grabbing potential with just 30 days to go and voting already underway in some states in his race against his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris. Musician Lee Greenwood appeared on stage and serenaded him with \u201cGod Bless the USA,\u201d frequently played at his rallies, and billionaire Elon Musk spoke for the first time at a Trump rally.\n\n\u201cWe fought together. We have endured together. We have pushed onward together,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd right here in Pennsylvania, we have bled together. We\u2019ve bled.\u201d\n\nAt the beginning of the rally, Trump asked for a moment of silence to honor Comperatore, a firefighter who died as he shielded family members from gunfire in July. Classical singer Christopher Macchio sang \u201cAve Maria\u201d after a bell rung at the same time that gunfire began on July 13. Several of Comperatore\u2019s family members were in attendance, including his widow, Helen, who stood during Trump\u2019s remarks next to the former president\u2019s daughter-in-law, Lara Trump.\n\nStanding behind protective glass that now encases the stage at his outdoor rallies, Trump called the would-be assassin \u201ca vicious monster\u201d and said he did not succeed \u201cby the hand of providence and the grace of God.\u201d There was a very visible heightened security presence, with armed law enforcers in camouflage uniforms on roofs.\n\nTrump honored Comperatore and recognized the two other July rallygoers injured, David Dutch and James Copenhaver. They and Trump were struck when 20-year-old shooter Thomas Matthew Crooks of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, opened fire from an unsecured rooftop nearby before he was fatally shot by sharpshooters.\n\nThe building from which Crooks fired was completely obscured by tractor-trailers, a large grassy perimeter and a fence.\n\nHow Crooks managed to outmaneuver law enforcement that day and scramble on top of a building within easy shooting distance of the ex-president is among many questions that remain unanswered about the worst Secret Service security failure in decades. Another is his motive.\n\nPennsylvania is critical to both presidential campaigns\n\nTrump lost Pennsylvania four years ago after flipping it to the Republican column in 2016. He needs to drive up voter turnout in conservative strongholds like Butler County, an overwhelmingly white, rural-suburban community, if he wants to win Pennsylvania in November after losing it four years ago. Harris, too, has targeted her campaign efforts at Pennsylvania, rallying there repeatedly as part of her aggressive outreach in critical swing states.\n\n\u201cPennsylvania, clearly, is going to be the center of the universe for the next 30 days, for both sides, and we\u2019re pretty bullish on where we are here organizationally, politically, and in terms of the resources that we\u2019ve been able to commit here,\u201d campaign senior adviser Chris LaCivita told reporters.\n\nTrump highlighted Harris\u2019 previous stance against fracking, a process of producing natural gas key to Pennsylvania\u2019s economy, like he has done in the past. But then, he continued to spread falsehoods about the federal response to Hurricane Helene, further spreading a claim floating around that disaster survivors are only getting $750 from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. That figure refers to help the agency can give someone in an affected area for what they might need immediately.\n\nTrump also claimed Harris had \u201clost more than 325,000 migrant children that are now dead, in slavery or just plain missing.\u201d An August report from a government watchdog said those were cases where immigration officials were faulted for failing to consistently \u201cmonitor the location and status of unaccompanied migrant children\u201d once they are released from federal government custody. Those figures also covered more than two years of the Trump administration.\n\nRallygoers said they felt secure coming back to Butler\n\nCrowds were lined up as the sun rose Saturday. A large crowd packed bleachers, folding chairs and the expansive field stretching to the venue\u2019s edges. Area hotels, motels and inns were said to be full and some rallygoers arrived Friday. Much of the crowd waited several hours for Trump. About half an hour into his speech, Trump paused his remarks for more than five minutes after an attendee had a medical issue and needed a medic.\n\nButler County, on the western edge of a coveted presidential swing state, is a Trump stronghold. He won the county with about 66 percent of the vote in both 2016 and 2020. About 57 percent of the county\u2019s 139,000 registered voters are Republicans, compared with about 29 percent who are Democrats and 14% something else.\n\nChris Harpster, 30, of Tyrone, Pennsylvania, was accompanied by his girlfriend on Saturday as he returned to the scene. Of July 13, he said, \u201cI was afraid\u201d \u2014 as were his parents, watching at home, who texted him immediately after the shots rang out.\n\nHeightened security measures were making him feel better now, as well as the presence of his girlfriend, a first-time rallygoer. Harpster said he will be a third-time Trump voter in November, based on the Republican nominee\u2019s stances on immigration, guns, abortion and energy. Harpster said he hopes Pennsylvania will go Republican, particularly out of concern over gas and oil industry jobs.\n\nOther townspeople were divided over the value of Trump\u2019s return. Heidi Priest, a Butler resident who started a Facebook group supporting Harris, said Trump\u2019s last visit fanned political tensions in the city.\n\n\u201cWhenever you see people supporting him and getting excited about him being here, it scares the people who don\u2019t want to see him reelected,\u201d she said.\n\nTerri Palmquist came from Bakersfield, California, and said her 18-year-old daughter tried to dissuade her from traveling. \u201cI just figure we need to not let fear control us. That\u2019s what the other side wants is fear. If fear controls us, we lose,\u201d she said.\n\nShe said she was not worried about her own safety.\n\n\u201cHonesty, I believe God\u2019s got Trump, for some reason. I do. So we\u2019re rooting for him.\u201d\n\nGomez Licon reported from Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Associated Press writers Michelle L. Price in New York contributed to this report.",

        "text": "House introduces resolution to 'not recognize an illegitimate presidential election'\nDuring the special session on Sunday, several West Virginia delegates introduced a resolution requesting that the state legislature \u201cnot recognize an illegitimate presidential election.\u201d\n\nThe resolution, House Concurrent Resolution 203, was introduced by delegates Bill Ridenour (R-Jefferson), Margitta Mazzocchi (R-Logan), Henry Dillon (R-Wayne), Todd Longanacre (R-Greenbrier) and Elias Coop-Gonzalez (R-Randolph).\n\nHRC 203 states that the \u201cDemocrat-led regime, has utterly failed, and continues to fail, in a suspicious manner, in its absolute duty to adequately protect the Republican nominee for president\u201d before the resolution states that if there is \u201cabundant evidence that non-citizens have been and are being registered to vote in the national election of 2024,\u201d among other \u201csuspicious\u201d acts, the state will not recognize the elected president in 2024.\n\nThe resolution continues by stating that West Virginia will not recognize any Democrat candidate for President if the Republican candidate is assassinated, injured during an assassination attempt, incarcerated, or in any way barred from any state ballot.\n\nThis piece of legislation comes after the Republican nominee,this year and was in May in connection to hush money payment made to adult film actress, Stormy Daniels, in during his successful 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nLastly, the resolution said that if the state Attorney General, Secretary of State and the state legislature, in which Republicans currently hold a supermajority, determine that the Republican president or vice-presidential candidates are illegally eliminated from the race by fraud or interference, the governor will call a special session to \u201cprotect the will of the people.\u201d\n\nThe West Virginia Democratic Party released a statement Monday expressing its \u201coutrage\u201d by the introduction of the resolution, which it said aims to prevent anyone but Donald Trump from being recognized as the winner of the election.\n\n\u201cThe West Virginia Democratic Party stands firmly against this undemocratic resolution and any attempts to subvert the electoral process by preordaining an election outcome,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe call on all West Virginians to reject these un-American efforts and hold their elected officials accountable for undermining the foundation of our democracy.\u201d\n\nHRC 203 echoes similar rhetoric that Trump has used to question the legitimacy of the 2020 election results which saw him defeated by the Democratic nominee, now president, Joe Biden. Meanwhile, a after losing his second bid for the White House.\n\nTrump is currently facing several pieces of litigation due to this rhetoric around election legitimacy, and in Washington D.C. where the court questions the former president\u2019s role in",

His speech quickly swung from a somber commemoration of the slain firefighter, Corey Comperatore, to a sanded-down version of his standard attacks on his opponent .",
        "text": "Trump Returns to Site of July Assassination Attempt\nDonald J. Trump returned to Butler, Pa., on Saturday for a massive rally at the fairgrounds where he was struck in July by a would-be assassin\u2019s bullet, an event envisioned by his campaign as a show of strength and a memorial for the former volunteer fire chief who was killed during the attack.\n\nHis speech quickly swung from a somber commemoration of the slain firefighter, Corey Comperatore, to a somewhat subdued, sanded-down version of his standard attacks on his opponent, complete with exaggerations and falsehoods. Mr. Trump commended his own performance in the face of adversity and brought out one of his biggest backers, the billionaire Elon Musk, who jumped up and down on the stage.\n\nFor Mr. Trump, who has been jarred by the changes in the presidential race since he was attacked in Butler on July 13, the rally served another purpose: It offered him a chance to seek something of a do-over after a series of major events reshaped the contest just as the Republican convention in Milwaukee ended.\n\nThe rally\u2019s stagecraft and programming \u2014 with singers, family members and friends serving as \u201ccharacter witnesses\u201d \u2014 echoed the convention\u2019s grandiosity, down to the same opera singer who closed out the proceedings in Milwaukee performing a handful of songs.\n\nPresident Biden announced he was dropping his 2024 bid three days after Mr. Trump\u2019s nominating convention, swamping all news coverage of the former president\u2019s near-death experience and resetting the race with a new, younger Democratic opponent almost immediately.\n\nSo in Butler on Saturday, Mr. Trump sought to recapture the same spirit that engulfed him in Milwaukee, where he was riding high in the polls as he was nominated for a third time just five days after the shooting.\n\nThe rally \u2014 which Mr. Trump was intent on holding \u2014 was marked by intense security, a sprawling crowd and some anxiety, with Mr. Trump having faced a second attempt on his life since July.\n\nMr. Trump, at a rally where other speakers bemoaned the overheated rhetoric in the campaign as leading to violence, seemed to focus on his victimhood, making a baseless suggestion at one point that the attempt on his life could have been the work of the same political opponents he has repeatedly accused of weaponizing impeachments and the criminal justice system against him.\n\nImage The crowd held signs that said \u201cFight! Fight! Fight!\u201d \u2014 echoing Mr. Trump\u2019s words after he was attacked. Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times\n\nFor a significant part of the day, Mr. Trump\u2019s team used the rally to honor Mr. Comperatore, who was killed during the assassination attempt in July as he shielded his wife and daughters from the gunfire. Mr. Comperatore\u2019s firefighter coat and helmet were placed in the stands behind the stage.\n\nMany in the crowd wore T-shirts reading \u201cFight! Fight! Fight!\u201d \u2014 quoting what Mr. Trump said right after his ear was grazed by a bullet in July. People stood in line for hours on Saturday in order to be part of the day, and were visibly delighted to be there.\n\nSeveral speakers mentioned Mr. Comperatore, with early speakers offering a somber reflection of the horror that had taken place at the fairgrounds less than three months earlier. And Mr. Trump, who met with Mr. Comperatore\u2019s family before his speech, opened his remarks by paying tribute to him.\n\n\u201cSome people just don\u2019t die in vain, and what he\u2019s left behind is incredible,\u201d Mr. Trump said. Later, he told his thousands of supporters how excited Mr. Comperatore had been to attend the rally in July.\n\n\u201cCorey had the best seat in the house,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cAnd he was telling his wife and family on the way over, he said, \u2018I\u2019m telling you, he\u2019s going to invite me up on the stage.\u2019\u201d Then, Mr. Trump added, \u201clittle did anyone realize that Corey would be on the stage three months later in an almost immortal position.\u201d\n\nThe efforts to humanize Mr. Trump \u2014 whose advisers were livid that Mr. Biden had ended what momentum they might have had coming out of their convention \u2014 began midway through the speaking program earlier in the day.\n\nSally Sherry, a paramedic who helped treat Mr. Trump at Butler Memorial Hospital in July, said she was moved to tears by his demeanor after the shooting as he reassured his family he was OK.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s running mate, Senator JD Vance of Ohio, commended Mr. Trump for returning to Butler. Mocking Ms. Harris, he asked the crowd who they would rather have dealing with foreign affairs: \u201csomeone who is afraid of interviews with the friendly American media or someone who faces down two assassins and returns triumphantly to the very place he got shot?\u201d\n\nTwo of Mr. Trump\u2019s friends in the business world, John Paulson and Steve Witkoff, offered testimonials. Then, Mr. Trump\u2019s son, Eric, and daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, gave speeches that had highlights of what they said at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. Mr. Trump entered to a live rendition of \u201cGod Bless the USA,\u201d the typical walk-on music played at his rallies, another moment borrowed from his convention.\n\nBut while the lead-up speeches before Mr. Trump took the stage were distinct for one of his rallies, and he made a dramatic entrance by taking the stage and declaring, \u201cAs I was saying,\u201d a reference to when he felt something strike his ear at the July 13 rally, his speech was mostly a fairly standard collection of his rally remarks.\n\nImage Elon Musk has been one of former President Donald J. Trump\u2019s biggest backers. Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times\n\nThe most dynamic moment of Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks came when he invited Mr. Musk to the stage. The billionaire, who endorsed Mr. Trump minutes after the assassination attempt, bounded up to the microphone, complained about a lack of laws requiring voter identification and warned ominously that November\u2019s election \u201cwill be the last election\u201d if Mr. Trump does not win.\n\nMr. Trump eased slightly off the starkly dark rhetoric with which he often describes the country, but frequently made exaggerated claims about immigration. At the start of his speech, he displayed a chart about the issue that he has credited with saving his life after he turned his head to look at it in July. But aspects of the graphic are highly misleading.\n\nMr. Trump also criticized Ms. Harris\u2019s previous support for a ban on fracking, an issue his campaign is hoping will energize voters in Pennsylvania, a critical battleground state. He repeated debunked claims about cheating in elections and fired up his base by talking about transgender athletes.\n\nAnd he mocked Ms. Harris as being insufficiently interested in those affected by Hurricane Helene, despite the fact that she spent Saturday on a trip to storm-ravaged North Carolina.\n\nKate Kelly contributed reporting.",

        "text": "Trump leads, and his party follows, on vaccine skepticism \u2022 Louisiana Illuminator\nMore than four years ago, former President Donald Trump\u2019s administration accelerated the development and rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nThe project, dubbed Operation Warp Speed, likely saved millions of lives. But a substantial number of Republican voters now identify as vaccine skeptics \u2014 and Trump rarely mentions what\u2019s considered one of the great public health accomplishments in recent memory.\n\n\u201cThe Republicans don\u2019t want to claim it,\u201d Trump told an interviewer in late September.\n\nInstead, on at least 17 occasions this year, Trump has promised to cut funding to schools that mandate vaccines. Campaign spokespeople have previously said that pledge would apply only to schools with covid mandates. But speeches reviewed by KFF Health News included no such distinction \u2014 raising the possibility Trump would also target vaccination rules for common, potentially lethal childhood diseases like polio and measles.\n\nThe Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment on this article.\n\nTrump has presided over a landslide shift in his party\u2019s views on vaccines, reflected this campaign season in false claims by Republican candidates during the primaries and puzzling conspiracies from prominent conservative voices. Republicans increasingly express worry about the risks of vaccines. A September 2023 poll from Politico and Morning Consult showed a narrow majority of those voters cared more about the risks than the benefits of getting inoculated.\n\nA surge in anti-vaccine policy in statehouses has followed the rhetoric. Boston University political scientist Matt Motta, who tracks public health policy, said preliminary data shows that states enacted at least 42 anti-vaccine bills in 2023 \u2014 nearly a ninefold surge since 2019.\n\nIn some states, it has the look of a crusade: The 2024 Texas GOP platform, for example, proposes a ban on mRNA technology, the innovation behind some covid-19 vaccines that scientists believe could have significant applications for cancer care.\n\nLast month, Trump made an appeal to anti-vaccine voters by landing the endorsement of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., one of the nation\u2019s most prominent vaccine skeptics \u2014 and appointing him to his transition team. In a recent tour with former Fox News broadcaster Tucker Carlson, Kennedy said he was \u201cgoing to be deeply involved in helping to choose the people who run FDA, NIH, and CDC.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s outreach can be more discreet: He recently met with a delegation of vaccine-skeptical activists \u2014 including one group pushing an end to mandates and certain types of vaccines \u2014 at his New Jersey golf club; the discussion was publicized by the conservative blog \u201cGateway Pundit.\u201d\n\nTrump has options in advancing anti-vaccine goals as president, such as by sowing further doubt and undermining the federal government\u2019s ability to make vaccine recommendations. He has promised to appoint Kennedy, along with \u201ctop experts,\u201d to a panel exploring chronic diseases, some of which Kennedy\u2019s nonprofit has linked to inoculations. \u201cNobody\u2019s done more\u201d to advocate for \u201cthe health of our families and our children,\u201d Trump declared at a rally accepting Kennedy\u2019s endorsement.\n\nStill, it\u2019s hard to tell how Trump\u2019s most frequently made proposal \u2014 defunding schools that mandate vaccinations \u2014 would translate into action, said Judith Winston, former general counsel of the Department of Education during the Obama administration.\n\nCurrently, the Department of Education lacks the power to turn off public school funding all at once, she said \u2014 meaning a second Trump administration would have to take away money program by program.\n\nAnd the legal basis for such a move isn\u2019t clear. \u201cI am unaware of any federal law that mandates school districts either provide or not provide a vaccine,\u201d Winston said, adding it would probably require congressional action.\n\nAll 50 states have a vaccine requirement tied to school attendance.\n\nTrump\u2019s outreach to anti-vaccine constituencies comes as vaccine hesitancy increases and preventable disease surges. This summer, Oregon experienced its worst outbreak of measles since 1991.\n\nThe situation could get worse, said Tom Frieden, a former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: In the Nineties, during a time when vaccine skepticism also proliferated, the U.S. saw thousands of measles cases. According to the CDC, we haven\u2019t yet returned to those bad old days \u2014 but the number of measles cases recorded this year is already quadruple that of last year.\n\n\u201cIt was highly disruptive,\u201d he said. \u201cMany children who had measles ended up with hearing problems or cognitive problems that were lifelong. A small number died in this country.\u201d\n\nWorldwide, the disease killed over 100,000 in 2022, mostly among children under age 5, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nPolling shows a substantial minority of Americans, concentrated in the Republican Party, hold vaccine-skeptical positions, said Harvard professor and health politics expert Robert Blendon. And skepticism about covid vaccines is blossoming into suspicion of vaccines generally among that group, he said. \u201cIt follows from this rebellion against the covid vaccine mandates.\u201d\n\nVaccine opposition has divided the GOP. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis made opposition to vaccines a core part of his ill-fated campaign for the GOP presidential nomination. In states such as Wyoming and Missouri, pitched primary campaigns centered on anti-vaccine themes this year.\n\nBob Onder, a physician and Republican candidate for Congress in Missouri, was accused in Facebook ads placed by his top opponent of taking millions from pharmaceutical companies to test vaccines. \u201cHe profited from our pain,\u201d one ad said. \u201cYou suffered the consequences.\u201d\n\nOnder \u201chas never done covid vaccine research\u201d and opposes covid vaccine mandates, his campaign manager, Charley Lovett, told KFF Health News. (Lovett said Onder \u201cconducted\u201d one study sponsored by AstraZeneca on preventing covid in high-risk patients using monoclonal antibodies, not vaccines.)\n\nOnder won the Republican primary, but his vaccine-disparaging opponent still scored just over 37% of the vote.\n\nAnti-vaccine candidates typically become anti-vaccine policymakers. The impact can be seen in Texas, where vaccine politics were once a bipartisan matter. According to researchers, from 2009 to 2019, legislators there passed 19 pro-vaccine bills, such as a measure allowing pharmacists to administer immunizations.\n\nBut that consensus began to shift toward the end of the decade. Small groups, often nurtured on Facebook, made their influence felt. One such group, Texans for Vaccine Choice, spurred testimony before the state legislature in 2021 and targeted pro-immunization legislators, some of whom fell in their GOP primaries.\n\nMisinformation has fueled the anti-vaccine turn in Texas, alongside traditional conservative attitudes about individual autonomy, said Summer Wise, a former executive committee member of the state\u2019s Republican Party \u2014 particularly misconceptions about the use of fetal cells in vaccine development; falsified research about a link between vaccines and autism; and conspiracy theories about Bill Gates, the billionaire philanthropist who has championed vaccination.\n\n\u201cPoliticians see vaccines as an easy foil to propagate fear among the electorate, which can then be leveraged and directed to control a voting bloc,\u201d Wise said.\n\nIn addition to calling for a ban on mRNA technology, the Texas GOP\u2019s 2024 platform features a laundry list of policies that could undermine vaccination, including allowing medical residents and physicians the ability to opt out of administering shots for religious reasons. It also calls for enshrining a patient\u2019s ability to opt out of vaccine mandates in the state\u2019s Bill of Rights.\n\nNationally, anti-immunization policies could take an aggressive turn under a second Trump administration.\n\nRoger Severino, formerly head of the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Office of Civil Rights and now with the Heritage Foundation, penned the health agency section of Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation-led initiative to plan for a Republican administration.\n\nAmong other ideas, the document proposes clipping CDC authority to issue vaccine or quarantine guidance of a \u201cprescriptive\u201d nature, targeted at schools or elsewhere.\n\nA spokesperson for the Heritage Foundation noted Severino has said the agency\u2019s credibility has been hurt, and it has a burden to explain \u201call the vaccines on the schedule being taken in combination.\u201d\n\nThe proposal misunderstands CDC\u2019s history and powers, said Lawrence Gostin, a public health law professor at Georgetown University. The agency \u201crarely if ever\u201d makes binding recommendations, he said.\n\n\u201cWhen the next pandemic hits, we will look to CDC to offer guidance based on the best-known evidence,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want a disempowered agency in a public health emergency.\u201d\n\nSome Republican intellectuals have spun dystopian visions surrounding vaccines. Take \u201cDawn\u2019s Early Light,\u201d a yet-to-be-published book by Heritage president Kevin Roberts. The tome \u2014 which earned a glowing foreword by Republican vice presidential nominee J.D. Vance \u2014 reserves especially sharp words for vaccines.\n\nIn one section of the book, Roberts imagines that the federal government would somehow use alleged new capabilities to \u201cdeplatform drivers\u201d of cars for \u201cfailing to follow the latest vaccine mandate.\u201d\n\n\u201cYet another powerful tool of social control falls into place,\u201d he wrote.\n\nYou bring facts to the surface.

A New Rule Could Allow Them to Exclude Decisive Votes.\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up for Dispatches, a newsletter that spotlights wrongdoing around the country, to receive our stories in your inbox every week.\n\nAn examination of a new election rule in Georgia passed by the state\u2019s Republican-controlled election board suggests that local officials in just a handful of rural counties could exclude enough votes to affect the outcome of the presidential race.\n\nThe rule was backed by national groups allied with former President Donald Trump. It gives county boards the power to investigate irregularities and exclude entire precincts from the vote totals they certify. Supporters of the rule, most of whom are Republicans, say it\u2019s necessary to root out fraud. Critics, most of whom are Democrats, say it can be used as a tool to disenfranchise select buckets of voters.\n\nAn analysis by ProPublica shows that counties wouldn\u2019t have to toss out many precincts to tip the election if it\u2019s as close as it was in 2020, when Trump lost Georgia by less than 12,000 votes. Based on tallies from that year, an advantage of about 8,000 Democratic votes could be at risk in just 12 precincts in three counties under the new rule, the analysis found. There are 159 counties in Georgia.\n\nA judge is expected to decide soon whether the rule will stand.\n\nThe three counties \u2014 Spalding, Troup and Ware \u2014 voted for Trump in 2020. But each has small yet significant concentrations of Democratic votes clustered in specific precincts. All three also have local election boards that have become stacked in recent years with partisans who\u2019ve voiced support for the false claim that Trump won the 2020 election or have cast doubt on the integrity of the election process.\n\nIn Spalding, about 40 miles south of Atlanta, a man who is now county election board chair had previously alerted Trump\u2019s attorneys to what police later determined was false evidence of voter fraud. More recently, he has tweeted that President Joe Biden is a \u201cpedophile,\u201d made sexually degrading comments about Vice President Kamala Harris and, this August, accused a top state elections official of \u201cgaslighting\u201d for saying there was no evidence of fraud in 2020.\n\nIn Ware County, in the southeast corner of the state, the election board chair is tied to far-right groups and has called democracy \u201cmob rule.\u201d In Troup County, which borders Alabama, the election board chair maintains that debunked \u201cstatistical anomalies\u201d in the 2020 vote still haven\u2019t been explained.\n\nThe legality of the rule was debated on Oct. 1 during back-to-back bench trials for two lawsuits. One was brought by the Democratic National Committee and others against the State Election Board, seeking to invalidate the rule. The other was brought by a Republican local board member against her county, the Democratic National Committee and others, seeking a judgment that she had the discretion not to certify election results.\n\nDuring the trial, Judge Robert McBurney said to the lawyer representing the Republican board member, \u201cYou have very successfully pulled me down an intriguing rabbit hole about, well, maybe you could certify some of the votes, but not all of the votes.\u201d\n\nThe boards\u2019 new power is the culmination of ground-level efforts in Georgia that began the day Biden was declared the winner of the 2020 election. After Trump lost \u2014 and after Georgia\u2019s Republican secretary of state rebuffed his demand to \u201cfind\u201d him the 11,780 votes he would have needed to win \u2014 GOP state legislators launched an effort to reshape county election boards, paving the way for removing Democrats and stacking them with Trump backers. Boards are supposed to administer elections in a nonpartisan manner, and some of these changes broke with the norm of having equal numbers of Republican and Democratic members, plus an independent chair to break ties.\n\nThe legislature also removed the secretary of state as head of the State Election Board and replaced members of the board \u2014 stacking it, too, with Trump partisans. At an August rally in Atlanta, Trump praised three of them by name, calling them \u201cpit bulls fighting for honesty, transparency and victory.\u201d The three board members did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nWith the addition of its newest member, the state board was able to do in August what the previous iteration of it wouldn\u2019t: Pass rules giving the county boards unprecedented power.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the rule allowing county boards to exclude specific votes was secretly pushed by Julie Adams, a leader of a group central to challenging the legitimacy of the American election system. That group\u2019s founder joined Trump on the call in 2020 during which he pressured the secretary of state to hand him victory.\n\nAdams, a Fulton County election board member, was the plaintiff in one of the two lawsuits. She did not respond to requests for comment or a list of detailed questions.\n\nThe State Election Board and attorneys representing parties in both lawsuits did not comment.\n\nA lawyer representing the Democratic National Committee referred ProPublica to the Harris-Walz campaign. \u201cFor months, MAGA Republicans in Georgia and across the country have been trying to lay the groundwork to challenge the election results when they lose again in November,\u201d deputy campaign manager Quentin Fulks said in a statement. \u201cA few unelected extremists can\u2019t just decide not to count your vote.\u201d\n\nDuring one of the bench trials, Richard Lawson, a lawyer for Adams and the America First Policy Institute, a conservative think tank aligned with Trump, argued that county board members should have the authority to exclude entire precincts\u2019 votes if they find something suspicious.\n\nA lawyer for the Democratic National Committee, Daniel Volchok, warned that board members making \u201cindividual determinations about if a ballot is fraudulent or otherwise should not be counted\u201d is \u201ca recipe for chaos.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is also a recipe for denying Georgians their right to vote.\u201d\n\nSpalding County has for years played a prominent role in Trump supporters\u2019 efforts to challenge election results.\n\nIn 2020, Trump\u2019s allies trying to overturn the election quickly realized that the weakest points in America\u2019s election system are its thousands of counties, where the day-to-day work of running elections is done. Previously unreported emails and messages show that one of the first places they targeted was Spalding County.\n\nIn the days after the election, Ben Johnson, the owner of a tech company who in 2021 would become chair of the Spalding County election board, began tweeting repeatedly at a team of lawyers challenging the election results on behalf of Trump, including Sidney Powell and Lin Wood, a ProPublica review of his deleted but archived tweets found. Johnson also advocated on social media for overturning the election. The Daily Beast reported in 2022 on other Johnson tweets, including one suggesting that Wood investigate claims of election fraud in Spalding County.\n\nAbout two weeks after the election, a hacker emailed Wood and others to say that that he and another operative were \u201con ground & ready for orders\u201d near Spalding County, outlining in a series of attachments how they were seeking to acquire voting machine data to prove the election was stolen in Spalding and another Georgia county. (Wood previously told ProPublica, \u201cI do not recall any such email\u201d and that he did not give the hacker any orders, though he did say he recalled the hacker \u201cleaving one night to travel to Georgia.\u201d The hacker did not previously respond to requests for comment.)\n\nMessages obtained by ProPublica show that about an hour later, the operative messaged the hacker: \u201cWoot! We have a county committing to having us image\u201d voting machine data.\n\nThe hacker and operative were able to help their allies access voter machine data elsewhere, which became a central pillar in a long-running conspiracy theory that voting machines were hacked. That theory was key to justifying attempts to overturn the 2020 election. In Spalding County, however, their plan fell apart after the secretary of state made clear in a memo that accessing such data would be illegal. \u201cOur contact wants to give us access, but with that memo it makes it impossible,\u201d the operative wrote, without \u201cher getting in a lot of trouble.\u201d\n\nAfter Trump\u2019s loss, the Republican-controlled state legislature passed a massive bill \u201cto comprehensively revise elections\u201d in response to \u201cmany electors concerned about allegations of rampant voter fraud.\u201d And Republican state legislators began writing bills to revamp local election boards, one county at a time. Since 2021, the reorganizations of 15 boards have brought a wave of partisan Republicans, ProPublica found.\n\nAs a result of the 2021 reorganization in Spalding, the election board lost three Black Democrats. Three new white Republicans became the majority \u2014 including Johnson, who became chair.\n\nIn 2022, after news outlets reported that Johnson had supported the QAnon conspiracy theory on social media, he tweeted an open letter emphasizing that he \u201ctook an oath to serve in the interests of ALL eligible voters of Spalding County\u201d and \u201cThere\u2019s no room for politics in the conducting of Elections.\u201d\n\nSince then, Johnson has continued to share social media content questioning the integrity of Georgia\u2019s elections.\n\nReached by phone, Johnson said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk to any liberal media\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019re going to spread lies.\u201d He did not respond to a detailed list of questions subsequently sent to him.\n\nThe new rule says that if there are discrepancies between the number of ballots cast and the number of people recorded as having voted in a given precinct, \u201cThe Board shall investigate the discrepancy and no votes shall be counted from that precinct until the results of the investigation are presented to the Board.\u201d If \u201cany error\u201d or \u201cfraud is discovered, the Board shall determine a method to compute the votes justly.\u201d\n\nMinor discrepancies between the number of voters and ballots are not uncommon. For instance, ballots can become stuck in scanners, voters can begin filling out a ballot and then stop before submitting it, or election systems can be slow to update that a provisional ballot has been corrected.\n\nIn counties like Spalding, Ware and Troup \u2014 with Republican-leaning boards and at least a few Democratic-heavy precincts \u2014 the conservative majority has the power to determine how to \u201ccompute the votes justly.\u201d At the trial and in court documents, Democratic lawyers argued this could mean not certifying Democratic votes, with one arguing in a brief that county board members \u201cwill attempt to delay, block, or manipulate certification according to their own political preferences\u201d by invoking the rule \u201cto challenge only certain types of ballots or returns from certain precincts as fraudulent.\u201d\n\nDemocratic voters in many conservative rural counties are packed into a small number of precincts. In 2020, Spalding had five precincts with Democratic majorities, which provided about 3,300 more votes for Biden than Trump. Troup had five such precincts totaling about 3,000 such votes, and Ware had two such precincts totaling roughly another 1,600 votes.\n\nTroup County removed two Black women and two men \u2014 all Democrats, one said \u2014 from its elections board when it restructured in 2021, shrinking the board from seven to five members.\n\n\u201cThey definitely wanted us off the board,\u201d said former member Lonnie Hollis, who is worried the new board will behave partisanly this election. She said Republican officials in Troup have connections to the state party.\n\nThe board\u2019s new chair, William Stump, a local banker, said that he believes Troup got its vote totals right last presidential election but that \u201cthere were some fairly significant statistical anomalies\u201d elsewhere in Georgia.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t pass the smell test,\u201d he said. Stump recently appeared at a GOP luncheon in LaGrange with State Election Board member Janelle King, whose ascension to the board cemented its MAGA majority and enabled the passage of the rules.\n\nStump said he was at the luncheon, where the GOP handed out Trump gear, to answer questions about the election process. \u201cWe don\u2019t have, I don\u2019t think, outwardly partisan folks on the board,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody\u2019s concern is to get the numbers right and get them out on time.\u201d\n\nWhen Ware County reconstituted its election board in 2023, it removed two Black members who were Democrats and installed Republican Danny Bartlett as chair. Bartlett, a retired teacher, served as executive director of the Okefenokee chapter of Citizens Defending Freedom, a Christian nationalist group the Southern Poverty Law Center calls \u201canti government\u201d and \u201cpart of the antidemocratic hard-right movement.\u201d\n\nBartlett also started a Facebook group in 2022 called Southeast Georgia Conservatives in Action that asks potential members. \u201cAre you ready to take action against the assault upon our country?\u201d Bartlett sought to raise money for the group through a raffle that offered as a grand prize a \u201cHome Defense Package\u201d that included $2,000 worth of guns, gear and a \u201cPatriot Pantry 1-week Food Supply Ammo Can.\u201d\n\nBartlett did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nCarlos Nelson, Ware\u2019s elections supervisor, said he opposed the board\u2019s restructuring but said that Bartlett hasn\u2019t gone along when conservative activists have demanded measures such as hand-counting ballots. \u201cHe has been a really good chair,\u201d said Nelson, who is a Democrat. He said he didn\u2019t know about Bartlett\u2019s outside political affiliations but that they were \u201ctotally different from his participation on the board.\u201d\n\nShawn Taylor, one of the Black board members who was removed, said she\u2019s concerned that the new election leaders are too partisan and may try to sway the election results.\n\nProPublica Read More Some Issues and Topics Our Reporters Will Be Following in a Second Trump Presidency \u2014 and How to Get in Touch\n\n\u201cThese MAGA Republicans are putting things in place to try to steal the election,\u201d she said, adding she did not think all Republicans supported those attempts. \u201cI believe that it\u2019s going to cause major conflict within a lot of these counties.\u201d\n\nThe Ware County commission in July removed a new conservative election board member, Michael Hargrove, who had complained about the \u201cBiden/Harris Crime Syndicate\u201d on social media, after he entered a polling site\u2019s restricted area during spring elections and got into a confrontation with a poll worker. Hargrove said in an email that he \u201chad, as an Elections Board member, EVERY right to be in that location at that time. Any other issue related to that event is juvenile nonsense.\u201d\n\nHis replacement, Vernon Chambless, is a local lawyer who told ProPublica that he believes Trump should have been declared the winner in 2020. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make sure that everything\u2019s kosher before we certify,\u201d he said.",

        "text": "South Korean leader says North Korea wants US attention by showing off nuclear might\nSEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 North Korea\u2019s recent disclosure of a nuclear facility was likely an attempt to grab U.S. attention ahead of next month\u2019s presidential election, and the North will likely stage major provocations like a nuclear test explosion and a long-range missile test, South Korea\u2019s president says.\n\nPresident Yoon Suk Yeol shared his government\u2019s assessment on the recent moves by North Korea with The Associated Press, before he leaves Sunday for a three-nation trip that includes a stop in Laos for summits with Southeast Asian and other world leaders. At Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)-related meetings, Yoon says he\u2019ll emphasize that North Korea\u2019s nuclear disarmament is essential to regional peace.\n\n\u201cAt the upcoming ASEAN-related summits, I will stress the importance of denuclearization of North Korea, which is a prerequisite for realizing a free, peaceful and prosperous Indo-Pacific region,\u201d Yoon said in written responses to questions from the AP.\n\n\u201cThis will serve to send a clear message that the international community will never condone North Korea\u2019s reckless actions,\u201d he said.\n\nConcerns about North Korea have grown in recent weeks, with the country unveiling a secretive uranium-enrichment facility, vowing to build more nuclear weapons and continuing its provocative missile tests. Last week, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un threatened to destroy South Korea with his nuclear weapons, if provoked.\n\nMany foreign experts say North Korea eventually hopes to use an expanded nuclear arsenal as leverage to win outside concessions like sanctions relief, after a new U.S. president is elected. They say Kim likely thinks a win by Republican candidate Donald Trump, whom he engaged in high-stakes nuclear diplomacy in 2018-19, would increase his chances to get what he wants than Democratic candidate Kamala Harris. During campaigns, Trump boasted about his personal ties with Kim, while Harris said she won\u2019t \u201ccozy up to tyrants and dictators like Kim Jong Un who are rooting for Trump.\u201d\n\nThe Sept. 13 disclosure of the nuclear site showed Kim\u2019s defiance of U.S.-led efforts to eliminate his advancing nuclear program. It was North Korea\u2019s first unveiling of a facility to produce weapons-grade uranium since the country showed one at its main Yongbyon nuclear complex to visiting American scholars led by nuclear physicist Siegfried Hecker in 2010. Hecker said the centrifuge hall shown in the recent North Korean photos was not the same one that he saw in 2010.\n\n\u201cNorth Korea seems to have recently disclosed its nuclear facility in order to draw attention from the United States and the international community in the run-up to the U.S. presidential election, and it is likely that North Korea will carry out additional provocations such as nuclear tests and ICBM (intercontinental ballistic missile) launches going forward,\u201d Yoon said.\n\nYoon didn\u2019t elaborate whether South Korea has detected any suspicious activities in North Korea that indicate its preparations for nuclear and ICBM tests. He said South Korea is closely monitoring North Korea\u2019s movements through the South Korea-U.S. combined intelligence and surveillance assets.\n\nNorth Korea has conducted six underground nuclear tests since 2006, and numerous ICBM test-launches in recent years. Additional tests are likely meant to further hone its nuclear and missile capabilities. Many observers assess North Korea has yet to possess functioning nuclear missiles that can reach the U.S. mainland, though it likely has ones that can strike all of South Korea and Japan.\n\nSince his inauguration in 2022, Yoon, a conservative, has made a stronger military alliance with the United States the center of his foreign policy to cope with North Korea\u2019s evolving nuclear threats. He\u2019s also taken a major step toward moving beyond historical disputes with Japan to beef up a trilateral Seoul-Washington-Tokyo security partnership. Such moves have enraged North Korea, which has called Yoon \u201ca traitor\u201d and ignored his calls for dialogue.\n\nThere are some potential worries about the South Korea-U.S. alliance if Trump returns to the White House. He had previously asked South Korea to drastically increase its share for the cost of the U.S. military deployment on its soil. Some experts say Trump\u2019s possible push for a new round of negotiation with Kim could complicate Yoon\u2019s approach on North Korea\u2019s nuclear program.\n\nBut Yoon said that he\u2019s confident that the \u201cironclad\u201d South Korea-U.S. alliance will continue to advance steadily regardless of the outcome of the U.S. election.\n\n\u201cThere is a firm bipartisan support for the ROK-U.S. alliance in the United States,\u201d Yoon said. \u201cNumerous leading U.S. Democrats and Republicans have publicly stated their staunch support for the alliance and are continuously visiting Korea for consultations to enhance the bilateral relations.\u201d\n\nThe ROK stands for the Republic of Korea, South Korea\u2019s formal name.\n\nYoon also expressed confidence that South Korea and Japan will continue to advance their bilateral ties under Japan\u2019s new Cabinet led by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who took office last week. Yoon\u2019s office said the two countries are discussing arranging a meeting between Yoon and Ishiba on the sidelines of the ASEAN summit.\n\nYoon said he believes North Korea\u2019s nuclear threats against South Korea are aimed at fomenting internal divisions in South Korea and tightening its domestic control with heightened military tensions on the Korean Peninsula.\n\n\u201cThe North Korean regime\u2019s past claim that its nuclear development was never intended to target the Republic of Korea, since we are one nation, has been debunked,\u201d Yoon said.\n\nAsked about North Korea\u2019s repeated launches of trash-carrying balloons toward South Korea, Yoon said that North Korea \u201cwill face consequences that it will find difficult to withstand\u201d if the safety of South Korean people is jeopardized. He didn\u2019t elaborate what specific steps his government is considering.\n\nBefore visiting Laos, Yoon is to travel to the Philippines and Singapore.\n\nAt the ASEAN-related summits, Yoon said that a key issue that South Korea plans to raise other than the North Korean nuclear program is the establishment of the ROK-ASEAN comprehensive strategic partnership. He said South Korea will further expand cooperation with ASEAN on a range of areas such as politics, military exchanges, cybersecurity, environments and a safety net against financial crises.",

        "text": "Protecting Your Vote: Georgia election workers prepare for election under cloud of threats\nABC News looks at the people ensuring the integrity of the voting process.\n\nThis story is part of ABC News' monthlong series \"Protecting Your Vote,\" profiling people across the country who are dedicated to ensuring the integrity of the voting process.\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2020 presidential election, arguably no state became as central to former President Donald Trump's efforts to overturn his election loss as Georgia -- the state Joe Biden stunningly won by just over 11,000 votes, flipping it blue for the first time in nearly three decades.\n\nNow, four years later, election officials in the state are preparing for another high-stakes election -- this time under the cloud of threats, conspiracy theories, and distrust in the system.\n\nThat reality has permeated even the deepest Republican regions. In Paulding County, Georgia -- a rock-solid Republican county just outside Atlanta -- election workers are training to prepare for the worst: screaming voters, deadly packages, or active shooters.\n\n\"Most important thing is to get those voters out and get them to safety or put them in a room,\" Deirdre Holden, the election director in Pauling County, said through tears in an interview with ABC News' Steve Osunsami. \"Get in the room there, barricade the door and fight for your life if you have to. And I never thought I'd ever have to say those words.\"\n\nHolden has directed elections in Paulding County for the last 17 years, a job she says she deeply loves. And though Paulding is still a Republican county, where Trump won in 2020 carrying 63% of the vote, Holden said she began receiving threats on her life, often by those who falsely blamed her and other election workers when Trump lost the election.\n\n\"We'll make the Boston bombings look like child's play at the poll sites in this county,\" said one threat emailed to Holden. \"You just f------ wait.\"\n\nNow, in preparation for the 2024 election, the small election office in Paulding's county seat has had to install panic buttons and surveillance cameras. The office, which sits in the small town of Dallas, Georgia, also stocks a bright red bag of Narcan near the mailbox -- in case someone attempts to harm the staff with an envelope of deadly substances.\n\nVoters cast ballots at the Park Tavern polling station, Nov. 3, 2020, in Atlanta. Jessica Mcgowan/Getty Images, FILE\n\nScarred by the violent and persistent threats that were lodged against election workers in the wake of 2020, Holden now worries about the safety of her own staff -- which is largely comprised of women.\n\n\"I always tell my girls in this office, I call them my girls ... it's my job to protect them,\" Holden said through tears. \"And I'm going to fight with everything I have. And I know I don't ever want it to come to that ... but I fear that that's what it's coming to.\"\n\nElection workers around the country have already faced threats in the run-up to the 2024 presidential election. In September, election officials in 22 states received suspicious packages in the mail, according to an ABC News survey, some of them addressed from the \"United States Traitor Elimination Army.\"\n\nOne of those packages was mailed to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger -- the Republican official who famously rejected Trump's push to overturn his loss in Georgia, in a phone call that later became the basis for Trump's criminal indictment in the state. Trump has entered a plea of not guilty in the case.\n\n\"Fellas, I need 11,000 votes, give me a break,\" Trump said on the Jan. 2, 2021, call, a copy of which was obtained by ABC News. Raffensperger rebuffed Trump, telling him he was \"wrong.\"\n\nIn an interview with ABC News, Raffensperger said the threats haven't stopped since he rebuffed Trump's call to help him \"find\" the votes he needed to win the state. Now, his office is working overtime to ensure a quick and accurate election once again.\n\n\"I want voters to understand in Georgia that we're going to have an accurate election,\" Raffensperger said. \"I also understand that half the people aren't going to like the results.\"\n\nDespite recent controversial rule changes in the state, Raffensperger underscored the state's ability to conduct a \"safe, secure and accurate\" election.\n\n\"It's my job to make sure it's fair and everyone has accessibility. We follow the law. We follow the Constitution,\" Raffensperger said. \"And only Georgians, lawful Georgians, are voting in the election. We have the cleanest voter rolls in the entire country.\"\n\nAnd in the suburbs, Holden says she's also ready. Early voting in the state starts in less than two weeks, and Holden said she is praying that she and her election workers stay safe -- despite those who still accuse them of wrongdoing.\n\n\"I promise you, there is no thought that ever goes through my mind of not counting a vote or cheating,\" Holden said. \"I wouldn't know how to throw an election if you paid me to. I mean, I just don't know how to do that.\"",

He warned \u201cthis will be the last election\u201d if Trump doesn\u2019t win and, clad in a black-on-black cap bearing the \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d slogan of Trump\u2019s campaign, appeared to acknowledge the foreboding nature of his remarks.\n\n\u201cAs you can see I am not just MAGA \u2014 I am Dark MAGA,\u201d he said.\n\nTesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk joint Donald Trump at election rally at Butler Farm, Pennsylvania, October 6th 2024 Alex Brandon/Copyright 2024 The AP. All rights reserved.\n\nThe appearance marked the first time Musk joined one of Trump\u2019s trademark rallies and represented the growing alliance between the two men in the final stretch of a competitive presidential election. Musk created a super PAC supporting the Republican nominee that has been spending heavily on get-out-the-vote efforts in the final months of the campaign. Trump has said he would tap Musk to lead a government efficiency commission if he regains the White House.\n\nTrump joined Musk in August for a rare public conversation on X, an overwhelmingly friendly chat that spanned more than two hours. In it, the former president largely focused on the July assassination attempt, illegal immigration and his plans to cut government regulations.\n\nBefore a massive crowd on Saturday, Musk sought to portray Trump as a champion of free speech, arguing that Democrats want \u201cto take away your freedom of speech, they want to take away your right to bear arms, they want to take away your fight to vote, effectively.\u201d Musk went on to criticise a California effort to ban voter ID requirements.\n\nSaturday\u2019s rally took place at the same property where a gunman\u2019s bullets grazed Trump\u2019s right ear and killed his supporter, Corey Comperatore. The shooting left multiple others injured.",

        "text": "Biden \u2018uncertain\u2019 if Israel is delaying peace deal to influence 2024 US election\nPresident Joe Biden had terse words for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday, and said he didn't know whether the Israeli leader was holding up a Mideast peace deal in order to influence the outcome of the 2024 U.S. presidential election. US President Joe Biden speaks during the daily press briefing at the White House in Washington, DC, on October 4, 2024. (AFP)\n\n\u201cNo administration has helped Israel more than I have. None. None. None. And I think Bibi should remember that,\" he said, referring to the Israeli leader by his nickname. \"And whether he\u2019s trying to influence the election, I don\u2019t know, but I\u2019m not counting on that.\u201d\n\nBiden, in a rare appearance in the White House press briefing room, was responding to comments made by one of his allies, Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., who told CNN this week that he was concerned Netanyahu had little interest in a peace deal in part because of U.S. politics.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you have to be a hopeless cynic to read some of Israel\u2019s actions, some of Prime Minister Netanyahu\u2019s actions, as connected to the American election,\u201d Murphy said.\n\nBiden and Netanyahu have long managed a complicated relationship, but they\u2019re running out of space to maneuver as their views on the Gaza war diverge and their political futures hang in the balance.\n\nFor Biden, a diplomatic deal would help resolve a deep divide among Democrats over the war and shore up support for Vice President Kamala Harris, making one fewer global conflict for her to manage should she win next month. Netanyahu has his own political concerns closer to home: His far-right coalition would abandon him if he stopped the war, and he could lose power and have to face his own legal problems. And Israel has been decimating Hezbollah\u2019s leadership, so there is little incentive to stop now.\n\nBiden has long pushed for a diplomatic deal, and he and his aides have indicated several times over the past few months that such an agreement was close. But it never seems to materialize, and in some cases, Netanyahu has publicly resisted the prospect while U.S. and Israeli officials continue to talk in private about eking out a deal.\n\nJust last week, the U.S., France and other allies jointly called for an immediate 21-day Israel-Hezbollah cease-fire, and expected Israel to welcome if not fully endorse the plan. Instead, Netanyahu publicly rejected it, telling leaders gathered for the U.N. General Assembly that Israel would \u201ccontinue degrading Hezbollah until all our objectives are met.\u201d\n\nIsrael has pressed forward on two fronts, killing top Hezbollah leaders and pursuing a ground incursion into Lebanon and conducting strikes in Gaza that killed dozens, including children. And the nation has vowed to retaliate for Iran\u2019s ballistic missile attack this week.\n\nOil prices rose 5% Thursday as concerns mounted that Israel would hit Iranian oil facilities as payback; a surge in gas prices so close to the election would be a blow to Harris, particularly after strong economic news Friday.\n\nBiden said there had been no decision yet on what type of response there would be toward Iran, though \"I think if I were in their shoes, I\u2019d be thinking about other alternatives than striking oil fields.\u201d\n\nHe pushed back against the idea that he was seeking a meeting with Netanyahu to discuss the response to Iran. He isn't, he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m assuming when they make a decision on how they\u2019re going to respond, we will then have a discussion,\" he said.\n\nBut Netanyahu has grown increasingly resistant to Biden\u2019s public charm offensives and private pleading, prompting the president\u2019s more assertive pushback. And Biden has in turn publicly held up delivery of heavy bombs to Israel and increasingly voiced concerns over an all-out war in the Middle East.\n\nDespite their long acquaintanceship, the two are not close or particularly friendly. When Biden was visiting Israel as vice president under Barack Obama, he and other U.S. officials were taken aback by an Israeli government announcement of new Jewish settlements in the West Bank, something the administration strongly opposed.\n\nNevertheless, Biden has remained consistent in his support for Israel\u2019s defense and security. In the aftermath of the deadly Oct. 7 Hamas attacks in Israel, he hugged Netanyahu on the tarmac of the airport in Tel Aviv. Since then, with few exceptions, Biden has supported ongoing and enhanced U.S. arms transfers to Israel while at the same time cautioning the Israelis to be careful in their responses to avoid civilian casualties.\n\n\u201cThe Israelis have every right to respond to the vicious attacks on them, not just from the Iranians, but from everyone from Hezbollah to Houthis,\u201d Biden said Friday. \u201cBut the fact is that they have to be very much more careful about dealing with civilian casualties.\u201d\n\nBiden has also ordered the U.S. military to step up its profile in the region to protect Israel from attacks by Hamas, Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen and Iran itself. In April, and again earlier this week, the U.S. was a leading player in shooting down missiles fired by Iran into Israel.\n\nBy contrast, Republican Donald Trump and Netanyahu have had a much more cordial relationship. Trump hosted Netanyahu in July. While president, Trump initiated policy changes that Netanyahu applauded, including recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, moving the U.S. embassy there from Tel Aviv, recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights and rescinding a decades-old U.S. legal determination that Jewish settlements in the West Bank were inconsistent with international law.",

        "text": "Michigan charges 4 people for intentionally voting twice in primary elections\nIn Michigan, four people were charged with committing a felony of intentionally voting twice during the summer primary election, the state attorney general announced on Friday, October 4.\n\nThe Detroit residents charged with the crime had sent a mail-in ballot and voted in person. Along with the residents, three officials have also been charged for allowing the voting to happen.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"It's shocking and simply unheard of,\" said Attorney General Dana Nessel.\n\nThe four people charged are accused of voting absentee and then in person, and with another felony of offering to vote more than once; all these crimes are punishable in the state by up to four and five years in prison, respectively.\n\nAs for the assistant clerks who are involved, three of them are facing charges of falsifying election records. The three accused are looking at a potential five-year sentence for allegedly altering the state\u2019s voter file after allowing double voting, which the system is trained to otherwise prevent. .\n\nThe charges being brought against the individuals carry a certain significance as the nation is gearing up for the presidential elections only weeks away. As it is, the margins are too close between the presidential candidates, and therefore, incidents like these will only lend credence to the prospect of an unfair election.\n\nMichigan is one of the states where voter turnout is expected to be high, thus making it an open play for either Vice-President Kamala Harris or former President Donald Trump.\n\n\"What occurred here cannot be allowed to be repeated in November,\" Nessel said. \"As to election workers, it is imperative that all election staff, volunteers and assistant clerks abide by the laws of this state.\"\n\nNessel added that the motive behind the act was unknown, and it remains unclear whether the seven of the charged were working together. She also pointed out that the extra votes did not affect the election race result.\n\nPublished By: Aryan Published On: Oct 5, 2024",

Share Copy Link Copy\n\nAs the Israel-Hamas war approaches its one-year mark, the U.S. presidential election could shape the path forward. On Oct. 7th, 2023, Hamas militants killed 1,200 Israelis, captured 250 hostages and triggered the ongoing conflict in Gaza. Since then, the death toll from Israel's retaliation has surpassed 41,000 people, according to Palestinian health officials.With ceasefire talks stalled and regional tensions spreading, some fear the political calendar in the United States may be delaying a peace deal. \u201cI certainly worry that Prime Minister Netanyahu is watching the American election as he makes decisions about his military campaigns in the North and in Gaza. I hope this is not true,\u201d Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Connecticut) told CNN in a recent interview. \u201cIt is certainly a possibility that the Israeli government is not going to sign any diplomatic agreement prior to the American election as a means to potentially try to influence the result.\u201dPresident Joe Biden was asked about those concerns directly on Friday. \u201cNo administration has helped Israel more than I have, none, none, none\u2026and I think that Bibi should remember that,\u201d Biden said, referring to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. \u201cWhether he is trying to influence the election, I don't know but I\u2019m not counting on that.\u201dLike Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris is supporting Israel as it conducts what the administration has described as a limited ground operation in Lebanon targeting the militant group Hezbollah, which has also resulted in civilian deaths. Harris responded publicly after Hezbollah\u2019s ally, Iran, fired nearly 200 missiles at Israel on Tuesday. \"I will always make sure Israel has the ability to defend itself against Iran and Iran-backed terrorist militias,\" Harris said.Former President Donald Trump went further. At a town hall event in North Carolina on Friday, he said Israel should strike Iran\u2019s nuclear sites in retaliation for Tuesday\u2019s attack, a step President Biden opposed earlier in the week while speaking to reporters. \"When they asked him that question, the answer should\u2019ve been \u2018hit the nuclear first, and worry about the rest later,\u2019\" Trump said.In the past, Trump has been critical of the Biden-Harris administration\u2019s push for a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas. He pledged to give Israel the support it needs to win but added \u201cI do want them to win fast.\u201d \"From the start, Harris has worked to tie Israel's hand behind its back, demanding an immediate ceasefire, always demanding ceasefire,\" Trump said at an anti-semitisim prevention event in August. \u201cThat would only give Hamas time to regroup and launch a new October 7-style attack.\"Harris has repeatedly highlighted civilian casualties in Gaza and advocated for a deal to end the fighting. \u201cWe cannot look away in the face of these tragedies, we cannot allow ourselves to be numb to the suffering and I will not be silent,\u201d Harris said in July, a few days after Biden dropped out of the presidential race.Middle East Institute Senior Fellow Brian Katulis said, while the next president will be an important player in the war, there are limits to America\u2019s influence. \"A lot of what's going on in the region these days is driven by the interests and the actions of those in the region,\" Katulis said. \"The United States does not have full power to actually control events.\u201d However, the next president could potentially play a key role in what happens after the war. Harris has endorsed a two-state solution, in which Israel would exist alongside an independent Palestinian state.Trump has been less clear during his campaign. Asked about his position in an interview with Time Magazine, Trump said, \u201cIt depends when. There was a time when I thought two states could work. Now, I think two states is going to be very, very tough. I think it's going to be much tougher to get.\u201dKatulis noted, while in office, Trump cut long-standing U.S. aid to the Palestinian people as part of a pressure campaign aimed at getting Palestinian leaders to accept a peace deal that was seen as favoring Israel\u2019s interests. \u201cI think we're going to see even less support than we've seen to the Palestinians over the last few years under a Trump administration,\u201d Katulis said. Still, there are signs Democratic support from Arab Americans is slipping. A recent poll conducted by John Zogby Strategies for the Arab American Institute found Trump leads Harris 46% to 42% among those who report they are \u201cvery likely\" to vote.\u201cKamala Harris regained much of the support Biden lost after October 7th, but Harris remains 18 points below Biden\u2019s 2020 level of support with Arab American voters,\u201d the release continues. \u201cIn our thirty years of polling Arab American voters, we have not witnessed anything like the role that the war on Gaza is having on voter behavior.\u201dA separate poll from Langer Research found Israelis broadly favor Trump.Another survey from the Associated Press - NORC Center found Trump and Harris are statistically tied when voters are asked who would better handle the Israel-Hamas war.",

        "text": "\u2018Will never quit, never bend,\u2019 says Donald Trump at site of July assassination attempt in Pennsylvania: 10 points\nFormer US President Donald Trump returned on Saturday to the site of a campaign rally where an assassin's bullet bruised his ear in July. It was Butler, Pennsylvania, where he vowed on Saturday that he would \"never quit... never bend... never break\". As the Republican leader spoke from behind a bulletproof glass, the crowd cheered: \"Fight, fight, fight\".\n\nAlso Read | How the Butler shooting changed Donald Trump\u2019s campaign\n\n\"Fight, fight, fight\" echoed Trump's rallying cry just after the July 13 shooting that grazed his ear and briefly upended the campaign for November's election. Speaking from the same spot on Saturday, here's what he said:\n\n1. \"As I was saying...,\"Donald Trump kicked off his speech with the immigration chart he was looking at when gunshots rang out in July. He pretended he was resuming the speech that was interrupted when he was grazed in the ear by a bullet on July 13.\n\n2. \"I will never quit. I will never bend, I will never break. I will never yield. Not even in the face of death itself,\" Trump said at the rally.\n\nAlso Read | Trump returns to site of assassination attempt in Pennsylvania\n\n3. \u201cWe fought together. We have endured together. We have pushed onward together,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd right here in Pennsylvania, we have bled together. We\u2019ve bled,\" he added.\n\n4. Donald Trump urged a large crowd to deliver an Election Day victory that he tied to his survival of the shooting. \u201cAnd if we win Pennsylvania, we will win the whole thing,\u201d Trump said Saturday.\n\n5. Trump on Saturday suggested his opponents had \u201cmaybe even tried to kill me\u201d. He said ominously, \u201cI wasn't supposed to make it.\u201d In his speech, Trump hinted without evidence about facing \"an enemy from within\" more dangerous than a foreign adversary.\n\nAlso Read | Donald Trump Vs Kamala Harris: US Presidential election betting goes LIVE\n\n6. At exactly 6:11, the moment Trump was shot 12 weeks ago, the former president asked for a moment of silence as classical singer Christopher Macchio sang \u201cAve Maria\u201d for roughly four minutes. A bell then tolled four times, once for each of the four victims, including Trump.\n\n7. Standing behind protective glass that now encases the stage at his outdoor rallies, Trump called the would-be assassin \u201ca vicious monster\u201d and said he did not succeed \u201cby the hand of providence and the grace of God.\u201d There was a very visible heightened security presence, with armed law enforcers in camouflage uniforms on roofs.\n\n8. In mid-speech, Donald Trump called up on stage Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and owner of social media platform X. It was his first time at a Trump campaign event since he endorsed the former president after July 13.\n\nAlso Read | Donald Trump and Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp use hurricane recovery to make first appearance together\n\n9. Musk jumped up on stage, pumping his fists in the air. \"The true test of someone's character is how they behave under fire,\" Musk said, calling the election a \"must-win situation\" for Trump and urging the crowd to register to vote. \"Be a pest to everyone you know,\" Musk said.",

        "text": "The next president is poised to inherit the fewest judicial vacancies in generations\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The next president is on track to enter office with the fewest number of vacant federal judgeships to fill in more than three decades, the culmination of both parties diverging sharply on what types of judges they want to appoint and putting a high priority on confirming their preferred judges while in charge.\n\nThe election is just over a month away and early voters have already started casting ballots for either Republican Donald Trump or Democrat Kamala Harris. However, of the myriad of issues that have dominated this election cycle and motivated voters, appointing judges hasn\u2019t received the same level of attention as in years past.\n\nIn 2016, a vacant Supreme Court seat placed the issue of judicial appointments front and center. In 2020, the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the last-minute confirmation of Justice Amy Coney Barrett again highlighted the role the president has in shaping the federal judiciary. But without the spotlight of a Supreme Court vacancy, the focus in the final weeks of the 2024 election has been aimed at the economy and other issues.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the Supreme Court that lacks vacancies. Out of the 870 Article IIl judgeships authorized by Congress, only 43 seats, or 4.9 percent, are currently vacant. In late September, the Senate confirmed Joe Biden\u2019s 213th judicial nominee before leaving town.\n\nAssuming the Senate continues confirming pending nominees when it returns in November, the next president is poised to inherit the smallest number of judicial vacancies since when George H.W. Bush ascended to the Oval Office in 1989. There were 46 vacancies when Biden took office \u2014 which itself was a new low since 1989.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said unequivocally that he will use the lame duck session to confirm more judges, as Republicans did in late 2020, regardless of who wins the presidency or control of the Senate.\n\n\u201cWe are going to use the lame duck to confirm judges. And we\u2019re going to do everything we can to get as many judges done as possible, trying to overcome the Republican obstruction,\u201d Schumer told NBC News in a recent interview.\n\nConfirming judges and justices takes 51 votes, a bar set by Democrats in 2013 for lower courts and extended by Republicans in 2017 to the Supreme Court. The Senate is slated to return on Nov. 12, and work for a total of five weeks until the new Congress is sworn in, unless it cancels breaks during Thanksgiving and Christmas.\n\nSchumer has said he hopes to top Trump\u2019s total of 234, although he isn\u2019t guaranteeing it.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll do our best,\u201d he said.\n\nAs of now, the number of vacancies might be low, however, Thomas Jipping, a senior legal fellow at The Heritage Foundation, said that he does expect an uptick in judicial openings once the new administration takes office \u2014 as judges who were waiting to see who would replace them opt to retire.\n\n\u201cOn the date that he or she raises their hand, it might be a particular number, but in very short order, the number of vacancies available to be filled will increase, possibly quite significantly,\" said Jipping, who added that it\u2019s a very \u201cdynamic process\u201d impacted by many factors including who wins the presidential election and the makeup of Congress.\n\n'Set their sights on getting judges confirmed'\n\nThe amount of judicial vacancies at any one time is fluid and can rise or fall based on circumstances. Judges can take a form of partial retirement known as senior status once they\u2019ve reached a threshold for years of service, they can completely retire, die in office or resign before they\u2019re eligible for retirement. But regardless of those factors, it\u2019s undeniable that the Trump and Biden administrations, combined with their congressional partners, have prioritized staffing the judiciary.\n\n\u201cI think the best simple explanation is simply a commitment to do it,\u201d said Russell Wheeler, a senior fellow at The Brookings Institution who studies the judiciary. \u201cBoth McConnell and Schumer have set their sights on getting judges confirmed.\u201d\n\nWhen Trump took office in 2017, he inherited more than 100 vacancies \u2014 a high number thanks to Senate Republicans blocking confirmation of former President Barack Obama\u2019s judicial nominees near the end of his term.\n\nDuring his four years in office, Trump appointed 234 federal judges, the second-highest amount by a one-term president. The high number of vacancies at the start of his administration helped achieve that number, combined with the willingness of Senate Republicans to continue confirming Trump\u2019s nominees after he had already lost the 2020 election but before Biden took office.\n\nBiden, a former chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, entered office with less than half the amount of vacancies that Trump inherited. But over the last four years, he has been able to appoint a comparable number of judges, despite a more contentious confirmation process in the Senate, especially when it comes to powerful appeals court judges.\n\nMore than half of the active judges on the nation\u2019s appeals courts were appointed by Trump and Biden, according to an analysis by liberal judicial advocacy group Demand Justice.\n\nZero of Biden\u2019s nominees for the federal appeals courts have been confirmed without opposition and 90 percent of them have received more than 30 \u201cNo\u201d votes in the Senate, according to Wheeler. Four percent of Trump\u2019s appeals court nominees were confirmed with no opposition and only 76 percent of his nominees received more than 30 \u201cNo\u201d votes.\n\n\u201cBy any token, I think Biden\u2019s judicial appointments are going to be one of the legacies of his administration,\u201d Wheeler said. \u201cThe number [of judges] for a four-year term, but also the demographic diversity of his appointees both in terms of race and ethnicity but also prior position, the number of public defenders.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s judicial legacy is already set, whether he returns to the White House or not. But another four-year term would give him the chance to shape an even greater portion of the judiciary and cement his place as the Republican president to have appointed the most judges since Ronald Reagan.\n\n\u201cIf Trump is elected, the judiciary becomes the Trump judiciary,\u201d said Maggie Jo Buchanan, managing director of Demand Justice. \u201cA President Harris would build on the legacy of the current administration but would shape her own judiciary with her own nominees and priorities.\u201d\n\nBut Harris\u2019 freedom to shape the judiciary could be limited to the amount of vacancies that arise. Both Trump and Biden, but especially Trump, emphasized appointing younger judges who could potentially stay on the bench for decades.\n\n\u201cAt some point, with all of these younger judges, particularly on the Court of Appeals, we\u2019re going to just run out of people eligible to retire,\u201d said John P. Collins Jr., an associate professor at The George Washington University Law School. \u201cThere is going to be something of a slowdown.\u201d\n\nThe outcome of the election could also determine how many more vacancies the next president gets to fill. About 100 federal judges meet the requirements to retire or claim \u201csenior status\u201d with full pay but haven\u2019t done so; the vast majority of them are Republican appointees. They may rethink that decision if Trump wins.\n\nOf the 43 current vacancies, just 14 have nominees pending before the Senate, according to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. The remaining 29 vacancies are for district courts, for which Senate Judiciary Chair Dick Durbin, D-Ill., is upholding a courtesy known as \u201cblue slips\u201d \u2014 that requires the sign-off of home state senators in order to advance those nominees. That means a slew of judgeships in red states represented by Republican senators could remain vacant.\n\nSome Republicans believe that tradition will continue in the coming years, which could limit the amount of judicial vacancies the next president is able to fill.\n\n\u201cOne thing that\u2019s constant is blue slips,\u201d said Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., who sits on the Judiciary Committee. \u201cAnd my friend, Senator Durbin, threatened a number of times to get rid of the blue slip, but I knew he was bluffing because Congress has given up so much of its power to the executive branch. I think most Democrats and Republicans support the blue slip. And they weren\u2019t about to get rid of it.\u201d",

        "text": "Hacks against US campaign latest examples of Iran targeting adversaries\nIran has emerged as a twofold concern for the United States as it nears the end of the presidential campaign.\n\nProsecutors allege Tehran tried to hack figures associated with the election, stealing information from former President Donald Trump's campaign. And U.S. officials have accused it of plotting to kill Trump and other ex-officials.\n\nFor Iran, assassination plots and hacking aren't new strategies.\n\nIran saw the value and the danger of hacking in the early 2000s, when the Stuxnet virus, believed to have been deployed by Israel and the U.S., tried to damage Iran's nuclear program. Since then, hackers attributed to state-linked operations have targeted the Trump campaign, Iranian expatriates and government officials at home.\n\nIts history of assassinations goes back further. After the 1979 Islamic Revolution, Iran killed or abducted perceived enemies living abroad.\n\nA history of hacks\n\nFor many, Iran's behavior can be traced to the emergence of the Stuxnet computer virus. Released in the 2000s, Stuxnet wormed its way into control units for uranium-enriching centrifuges at Iran's Natanz nuclear facility, causing them to speed up, ultimately destroying themselves.\n\nIranian scientists initially believed mechanical errors caused the damage. Ultimately though, Iran removed the affected equipment and sought its own way of striking enemies online.\n\n\"Iran had an excellent teacher in the emerging art of cyberwarfare,\" noted a 2020 report from the King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies in Saudi Arabia.\n\nThat was acknowledged by the National Security Agency in a document leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden in 2015 to The Intercept, which examined a cyberattack that destroyed hard drives at Saudi Arabia's state oil company. Iran has been suspected of carrying out that attack, called Shamoon, in 2012 and again in 2017.\n\nThere also were domestic considerations. In 2009, the disputed reelection of hard-line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad sparked the Green Movement protests. Twitter, one source of news from the demonstrations, found its website defaced by the self-described \"Iranian Cyber Army.\" There's been suspicion that the Revolutionary Guard, a major power base within Iran's theocracy, oversaw the \"Cyber Army\" and other hackers.\n\nMeanwhile, Iran itself has been hacked repeatedly. They include the mass shutdown of gas stations across Iran, as well as surveillance cameras at Tehran's notorious Evin Prison and even state television broadcasts.\n\nLow costs, high rewards\n\nIranian hacking attacks, given their low cost and high reward, likely will continue as Iran faces a tense international environment surrounding Israel's conflicts with Hamas and Hezbollah, Iran's enrichment of uranium to near weapons-grade levels, and the prospect of Trump becoming president again.\n\nThe growth of 3G and 4G mobile internet services in Iran also made it easier for the public \u2014 and potential hackers \u2014 to access the internet. Iran has more than 50 major universities with computer science or information technology programs. At least three of Iran's top schools are thought to be affiliated with Iran's Defense Ministry and the Guard, providing potential hackers for security forces.\n\nIranian hacking attempts on U.S. targets have included banks and even a small dam near New York City \u2014 attacks American prosecutors linked to the Guard.\n\nHacking attempts rely on phishing\n\nWhile Russia is seen as the biggest foreign threat to U.S. elections, officials have been concerned about Iran. Its hacking attempts in the presidential campaign have relied on phishing \u2014 sending many misleading emails in hopes that some recipients will inadvertently provide access to sensitive information.\n\nAmin Sabeti, a digital security expert who focuses on Iran, said the tactic works.\n\n\"It's scalable, it's cheap and you don't need a skill set because you just put, I don't know, five crazy people who are hard line in an office in Tehran, then send tens of thousands of emails. If they get 10 of them, it's enough,\" he said.\n\nFor Iran, hacks targeting the U.S. offer the prospect of causing chaos, undermining Trump's campaign and obtaining secret information.\n\n\"I've lost count of how many attempts have been made on my emails and social media since it's been going on for over a decade,\" said Holly Dagres, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council who once had her email briefly hacked by Iran. \"The Iranians aren't targeting me because I have useful information swimming in my inbox or direct messages. Rather, they hope to use my name and think tank affiliation to target others and eventually make it up the chain to high-ranking U.S. government officials who would have useful information and intelligence related to Iran.\"\n\nIran's killings, abductions abroad\n\nIran has vowed to exact revenge against Trump and others in his former administration over the 2020 drone strike that killed the prominent Revolutionary Guard General Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad.\n\nIn July, authorities said they learned of an Iranian threat against Trump and boosted security. Iran has not been linked to the assassination attempts against Trump in Florida and Pennsylvania. A Pakistani man who spent time in Iran was recently charged by federal prosecutors for allegedly plotting to carry out assassinations in the U.S., including potentially of Trump.\n\nOfficials take Iran's threat seriously given its history of targeting adversaries.\n\nEven before creating a network of allied militias in the Mideast, Iran is suspected of targeting opponents abroad, beginning with members of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi's former government. The attention shifted to perceived opponents of the theocracy, both in the country with the mass executions of 1988 and abroad.\n\nOutside of Iran, the so-called \"chain murders\" targeted activists, journalists and other critics. One prominent incident linked to Iran was a shooting at a restaurant in Germany that killed three Iranian-Kurdish figures and a translator. In 1997, a German court implicated Iran's top leaders in the shooting, sparking most European Union nations to withdraw their ambassadors.\n\nIran's targeted killings slowed after that, but didn't stop. U.S. prosecutors link Iran's Revolutionary Guard to a 2011 plot to kill the Saudi ambassador to Washington.",

        "text": "The next big dilemma for the U.S. Senate GOP: Who should lead in 2025 and beyond? \u2022 Washington State Standard\nWASHINGTON \u2014 U.S. Senate Republicans shortly after Election Day will face a major decision for their chamber as well as the national party when they pick a new leader.\n\nOnce the dust from the election clears and the balance of power in the Senate is decided, senators will gather behind closed doors to choose who will lead their conference. Come January, that person will step into one of the more important and influential roles in the U.S. government, as well as becoming a prominent figure for messaging and fundraising for the GOP.\n\nTexas Sen. John Cornyn, Florida Sen. Rick Scott and South Dakota Sen. John Thune have all publicly announced they\u2019re seeking the post. Thune is currently the minority whip, the No. 2 leader in the Senate GOP, and Cornyn held the whip job before him.\n\nThe lawmaker who secures the support of his colleagues will replace Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who since 2007 has led his party through three presidencies, numerous votes on natural disaster aid packages, the COVID-19 pandemic, two impeachments and the Jan. 6 insurrection.\n\nMcConnell, who served as majority leader when Republicans controlled the Senate, has been at the center of dozens of pivotal negotiations and ensured his position was a boon for his home state of Kentucky.\n\nThe Republican who takes his place will have to navigate choppy political seas in the years ahead as the GOP continues to hold onto the Reagan-era policies many still value, while adjusting to the brand of conservatism that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump champions.\n\nStates Newsroom interviewed Republican senators to find out what characteristics they believe the next GOP leader needs to have to earn their vote, and about the challenges that person will face in the years ahead.\n\nWhile only one senator would volunteer an opinion on a favorite candidate, many said they are interested in a leader who will emphasize moving legislation through the chamber, listen closely to members and forge strong ties with what they hope is a Trump administration.\n\nIn search of a workhorse\n\nMissouri Sen. Josh Hawley said he\u2019s looking for a \u201ccompetent\u201d Republican leader who will listen to members and work behind the scenes.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to see leaders on television commercials, I don\u2019t want to see them featured in Senate races, I don\u2019t want them as the deciding factor days before an election,\u201d Hawley said. \u201cI want somebody who is going to be a workhorse and who\u2019s going to work with members to achieve our priorities and then get stuff accomplished.\u201d\n\nWest Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito said the next GOP leader should hold the line on conservative priorities while also being able to negotiate bipartisan deals during what is expected to be a divided government. Democrats narrowly control the Senate, but Republicans are projected to possibly take the majority in the election.\n\n\u201cI would like somebody who can be strong in the face of opposition, present a strong argument, not afraid to take it to the other side when needed, but then also somebody that could get in the room and negotiate right when it gets tough,\u201d she said.\n\nCapito acknowledged the outcome of the presidential election could have an impact on who becomes the next Republican leader.\n\n\u201c(It) just depends on who wins,\u201d she said.\n\nKansas Sen. Roger Marshall said his choice will \u201cbe the most important vote that I take.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou vote for the president, that\u2019s important, but mine is one vote out of 150 million votes, or whatever it is. But this vote will be one out of, hopefully 53, so I think it has a lot of weight,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s really important that we elect a majority leader that shares the same priorities as, hopefully, President Trump.\u201d\n\nTennessee Sen. Bill Hagerty said the overarching criteria for the next GOP leader is their \u201cability to get along well with President Trump and the incoming administration.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe first 100 days are going to count, and we need to have very close alignment to make certain we\u2019re successful,\u201d Hagerty said.\n\nThere is no guarantee that voters will elect Trump as the next president during this year\u2019s presidential election. The next Senate GOP leader could end up working with an administration led by the Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nThat would require whomever Republican senators elect to walk a tightrope on Cabinet secretary confirmation votes, judicial nominees, must-pass legislation and potentially a Supreme Court nominee.\n\nLouisiana Sen. John Kennedy said he\u2019s vetting the candidates based on which one would be the most savvy, strategic, patient and inclusive.\n\nThat person, Kennedy said, must also be \u201cwilling to test his assumptions against the arguments of his critics and willing to ask God for money if necessary.\u201d McConnell has been known as a prodigious fundraiser for Republicans.\n\nChairmanship clout\n\nMaine Sen. Susan Collins, ranking member on the Appropriations Committee, said she\u2019ll vote for the candidate willing to devote significantly more floor time to debating and voting on bipartisan legislation.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s a real problem,\u201d Collins said. \u201cI\u2019d like us to go back to the days where power was vested in the committee chairs. And if they and their ranking members are able to produce a bill, that it gets scheduled for floor consideration.\u201d\n\nCollins, a moderate in a Senate conference packed with more conservative members, said she wants the next Senate Republican leader to recognize \u201cthat we\u2019re a big tent party and that we need to be inclusive in our approach.\u201d\n\nNorth Dakota Sen. John Hoeven, the top Republican on the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, said he wants a GOP leader to follow \u201cregular order on appropriations.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe get them through committee with bipartisan votes, but they\u2019re not getting to the floor,\u201d Hoeven said of the dozen annual government funding bills. \u201cWe need to get them to the floor, there needs to be an amendment process, and we need to act on the bills and get back to voting on bills and that\u2019s called regular order. And I think that\u2019s the biggest key for our next leader is to be able to do that.\u201d\n\nAlabama Sen. Katie Britt has begun talking with the candidates and is evaluating their plans for the Senate floor schedule, especially for bringing the annual government funding bills up for debate and amendment.\n\n\u201cI want to know how we\u2019re going to get the appropriations process back working; like, how we\u2019re actually going to move the ball down the field on that,\u201d Britt said. \u201cI want to know how we\u2019re going to actually embolden the committees and the committee process.\u201d\n\nBritt, ranking member on the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, expressed frustration with how much floor time goes toward confirming judicial nominees, something that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, and McConnell have both championed.\n\nSenate floor procedures are much more time-consuming than the rules that govern debate in the House. Legislation can take weeks to move through the filibuster process, which requires 60 votes for bills to advance, and for leaders to negotiate which amendments will receive floor votes.\n\nThe Senate, unlike the House, is also responsible for vetting and confirming executive branch nominees, like Cabinet secretaries, as well as judicial nominees. With a new president in place, 2025 will mean many confirmation votes.\n\n\u201cWhen we have a leader that really knows how to lead, they\u2019ll put appropriations bills on the floor, they\u2019ll figure out how to embolden members,\u201d Britt said, adding that \u201ca weak leader consolidates all the power, and that\u2019s, unfortunately, what I think we have right now when it comes to Chuck Schumer.\u201d\n\n\u2018Getting stuff done\u2019\n\nOklahoma Sen. James Lankford said whomever he votes for needs to \u201cbe successful at getting stuff done, finished, completed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have to be able to get our committees working and get legislation up, negotiated and moved,\u201d Lankford said.\n\nIowa Sen. Joni Ernst said whoever takes over as the next GOP leader must be able to communicate well with senators.\n\nThat person \u201cneeds to be someone that has strategy, and knows how to work the floor, certainly. And then, also fundraising is a portion of that, too.\u201d\n\nArkansas Sen. John Boozman said his vote will go to the person he believes can best build consensus and listen to members, though he hasn\u2019t yet decided which of the three contenders he\u2019ll support.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a true undecided,\u201d Boozman said. \u201cI think the reality is most members just want to get the election over. They don\u2019t want to deal with this until then.\u201d\n\nBoozman said the results of the battle for control of the Senate in the November elections could influence which candidate he and his colleagues pick to lead them during the next Congress.\n\nFlorida Sen. Marco Rubio said that the next GOP leader should be in tune with Republican voters and the issues important to them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s someone who I think has an affinity and is in touch with where our voters are,\u201d Rubio said.\n\nIowa Sen. Chuck Grassley declined to list off any characteristics he believes the next leader needs, saying he doesn\u2019t want any of the three to figure out his choice.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to tell you that, because this is what I told all three people that came to my office \u2014 I said, \u2018I\u2019m not going to tell either one of you. You\u2019re all friends of mine. You ain\u2019t going to know who I vote for,\u2019\u201d Grassley said. \u201cAnd if I answered your question, they\u2019re going to start figuring out who I\u2019m going to vote for.\u201d\n\nGrassley said the next leader\u2019s first major challenge will be negotiating a tax bill during 2025 that addresses expiring elements from the 2017 Republican tax law.\n\nKansas Sen. Jerry Moran said character matters in determining who he\u2019ll vote for, but said he hadn\u2019t created a score sheet just yet.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll have an idea of who I\u2019m voting for before the November election,\u201d Moran said. \u201cThose characteristics that I think are important would be important regardless of what the makeup of the House, Senate and the White House is.\u201d\n\nWisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson threw his support behind Scott for GOP leader, saying he prefers someone who previously served as a governor and worked in the private sector. He was the only senator interviewed by States Newsroom to reveal his vote, which will be conducted via secret ballot.\n\nHe said that Scott \u201cis willing to tackle tough issues.\u201d\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said that Republicans have \u201ca lot of good choices\u201d among the three men and that he wants someone who can carry the GOP message.",

Jasmine Crockett\n\nFreshman Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett (D-Dallas) is on the rise inside the Democratic Party.\n\nCrockett spoke at the Democratic National Convention and weeks later was named the national co-chair for the Harris-Walz campaign.\n\nCrockett was in Dallas for the State Fair Classic.\n\nFOX 4's Steven Dial asked what concerns her the most as we head into the final stretch of the campaign.\n\n\"It's quite unnerving to find that there's so many people that have no idea of what's going on, and so it is important that we get get out of our bubbles and recognize that not all of us are paying attention to the local news or national news or even social media. Some people just are in their own kind of silos and so it's important that we reach out to them, we talk to them and we educate them,\" said Crockett.\n\nREAD MORE: Voter registrations trending upwards, particularly among younger adults\n\nInflation and the economy are kitchen table concerns for many voters. While prices have gone down, many consumers will say it hasn't declined fast enough.\n\n\"There's only one candidate that's talking about the struggles when it comes to housing and wants to make sure that there's $25,000 down payment assistance that can be made available for first-time home buyers. There's only one candidate that's talking about those small businesses and being able to make sure that they can get started instead of saying a $5,000 tax benefit will give you a $50,000 tax benefit so that you can get started, as well as when we think about child care, it was the Democrat in the House and Senate that made sure that people were getting $300 a child to help them with the child tax credit and so she wants to bring that back for folks,\" said Crockett.\n\nRep. Dan Crenshaw\n\nFOX 26's Greg Groogan sat down with Congressman Dan Crenshaw (R-The Woodlands) in Houston to get his take on the choice before voters in the upcoming presidential election.\n\nCrenshaw believes the presidential election should be about policy, not personality.\n\nThe congressman raised concerns about what a Harris presidency could mean for Texas' energy industry.\n\n\"They're still obsessed with wind and solar and they're absolutely obsessed with destroying the fossil fuel industry,\" said Crenshaw.\n\nCrenshaw predicts a gradual degradation of the industry due to regulation in a Harris presidency.\n\nREAD MORE: Will the election impact your 401(k)? Here\u2019s what to know\n\n\"The Democrats play this very dangerous game where they know you don't feel that crazy regulation right now, and they know that you won't remember they did it 10 years from now when your life is totally different, and you can't prove a counterfactual,\" the congressman said.\n\nIn terms of social issues, Crenshaw expressed deep concern over Democratic zeal to advance trans rights.\n\n\"It's a yes or no. question: Do you think men should be in women's sports or do you think that should be illegal? Most of the public thinks it should be illegal. Most of the public thinks it's wrong,\" said Crenshaw. \"You are not in line with most of the public, certainly not most Texans.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Trump's mass deportation plan would oust 8.3M people from US workforce: study\n\nAs voters ponder their choice, Crenshaw urges them to remember the millions of unvetted migrants that have crossed the border during the Biden-Harris administration.\n\n\"You could assume 99% of them are just economic migrants, just trying to get jobs in kitchens and things, but 1% equals a lot of people here who could be terrorists, and some of them have. Hundreds have been on the terrorist watch list and those are just the ones we've caught,\" said Crenshaw. \"Think about foreign policy and showing peace through strength as opposed to just coddling our enemies until they invade other countries.\"\n\nYou can watch Texas: The Issue Is every Sunday night on TV and anytime on FOX LOCAL.",

        "text": "Disaster politics: Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are the latest to deal with fallout\nWASHINGTON - Another presidential election blown around by a hurricane.\n\nIn terms of politics, Vice President Kamala Harris and President Joe Biden are hoping that recovery from Hurricane Helene will resemble the federal government's response to Hurricane Sandy in 2012 - a fairly smooth process that did credit to the last Democratic-led White House in a presidential election season.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, meanwhile, is trying to turn the latest natural disaster to strike the U.S. during an election year into the Harris-Biden version of Hurricane Andrew in 1992 - a slow-and-sloppy response that sealed the political fate of defeated President George H.W. Bush.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nobody that\u2019s handled a hurricane or storm worse than what they\u2019re doing right now,\u201d Trump said to supporters Thursday night in Saginaw, Michigan.\n\nTrump's indictment has included falsehoods - he claimed that federal disaster money went to migrants and that Georgia GOP Gov. Brian Kemp had trouble reaching Biden, but neither were the case - and the 2024 Republican nominee for the White House has been accused of playing politics with disaster relief during his presidency.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nDuring his tour of ravaged areas of Georgia, Florida, North Carolina, and South Carolina, Biden urged people to put politics aside, and try to help as many storm victims as they can.\n\n\u201cWhen you do that, I hope we begin to break down this rabid partisanship that exists,\" Biden said during a visit to Ray City, Georgia. \"I mean that sincerely. There\u2019s no rationale for it.\u201d\n\nThis election's hurricane debate is particularly fierce in Georgia and North Carolina, storm-damaged swing states that are the recipients of candidate visits this week.\n\nIn Augusta, Georgia, Harris did not mention Trump by name, but told residents that \"we are here for the long haul ... The coordination that we have dedicated ourselves to will be long-lasting to get families, to get residents, to get neighborhoods back up and running.\"\n\nDisaster politics is nothing new\n\nDisaster politics are a staple of presidential politics, from the post-world war flu epidemic of 1918-1920 to the start of the COVID pandemic in 2020.\n\nAfter all, fall campaigns take place in the heart of flu season, although any disaster - and the government response to it - can change the shape of American politics.\n\nDuring the Great Mississippi River Flood of 1927, President Calvin Coolidge appointed a prominent official to head up relief efforts: Commerce Secretary Herbert Hoover.\n\nAlready famous for food supplies to Belgium during the world war, Hoover rode flood relief all the way to the White House (where he eventually ran into an economic calamity known as the Great Depression, although that's another story.)\n\nPresident Lyndon Johnson created a template for modern presidents in 1965 when he traveled to Louisiana to survey the damage wrought by Hurricane Betsy. LBJ assumed personal control of recovery operations.\n\n\"Presidents - as chief executives and the only leaders selected by the entire country - are expected to take actions that will protect and help Americans,\" said political scientist Lara Brown, author of \"Jockeying for the American Presidency: The Political Opportunism of Aspirants.\"\n\n\"When disasters occur,\" she said, \"Americans look to presidents to see how closely their promises of compassion, protection, and assistance match their deeds.\"\n\n1992: A warning to future presidents\n\nThe cautionary tale is President George Herbert Walker Bush.\n\nSeeking re-election in 1992, Bush already faced trouble from a slumping economy and a fierce challenge from Democrat Bill Clinton.\n\nThen came August and Hurricane Andrew, which smashed the southern coast of Florida.\n\nIn his biography of the elder Bush, historian Timothy Naftali wrote that \"it took too many days for the U.S. government to respond adequately.\"\n\nBush wound up losing a three-candidate election that included independent Ross Perot, although the incumbent Republican president did carry Florida (barely).\n\nAnother cautionary tale: Katrina\n\nHis son, Republican George W. Bush, took care to look on top of things when four hurricanes hit Florida in a six-week period during the 2004 hurricane season, another presidential election year.\n\nThe next year, after winning a second term, Bush suffered for a sloppy response to Hurricane Katrina, an example of what not to do.\n\nIn his memoir, Bush said his mistakes with the Katrina response added to existing burdens: \"The aftermath of Katrina - combined with the collapse of Social Security reform and the drumbeat of violence in Iraq -made the fall of 2005 a damaging period in my presidency.\"\n\nMemories of Katrina are so vivid that Trump - not a fan of the Bush family - brought it up in his recent Michigan speech.\n\n\u201cA certain president, I will not name him, destroyed his reputation with Katrina,\u201d Trump said in Saginaw.\n\nCooperation on Hurricane Sandy\n\nIncumbent President Barack Obama fared better in October of 2012 when Hurricane Sandy gutted the New Jersey coast.\n\nObama promoted cooperation with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a prominent Republican, and the Democratic president sailed onto victory over GOP nominee Mitt Romney.\n\nWhen Christie ran for president in 2016, Republicans criticized him for working with Obama. One primary opponent mocked the New Jersey governor by saying that \"he was like a little boy: \u2019oh, I\u2019m with the president.\u2019\"\n\n\"Remember, he flew in the helicopter and he was all excited,'\" said that rival, then a New York businessman named Donald Trump. \"I said, 'I would have put you in my helicopter - it\u2019s much nicer.'\u201d\n\nMike DuHaime, a former aide to Christie, said voters in his home state of New Jersey loved Christie for working with Obama, and overwhelmingly re-elected him governor in 2014.\n\nRepublican presidential caucus and primary voters, however, \"punished\" Christie when he ran for president, DuHaime said, \"as if somehow working with the federal government during the largest natural disaster in the history of the state was wrong.\"\n\nHe added: \"Somewhere along the line, compromise and bipartisanship became dirty words among the far right and far left.\"\n\nA political lens\n\nAs Trump tries to criticize Harris and Biden over Hurricane Helene, some of his own former administration officials said he played politics with disaster relief while he was in the Oval Office.\n\nTrump hesitated to provide disaster aid to areas he believed were Democratic leaning, including California as wildfires raged, said a report from Politico\u2019s E&E News that cited interviews with a pair of ex-Trump aides.\n\nBiden retweeted the article and said of its allegations: \"You can\u2019t only help those in need if they voted for you.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s the most basic part of being president, and this guy knows nothing about it,\" the president added.\n\nTrump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung called the story \u201cfake news\u201d that never happened. \u201cNone of this is true and is nothing more than a fabricated story from someone\u2019s demented imagination,\" Cheung told USA TODAY.\n\nOne of the former Trump administration officials cited by E&E News, Olivia Troye, told USA TODAY that \"it was so frustrating to see Trump this week\" attack others over disaster relief.\n\n\"We don't look at disaster relief through a political lens,\" Troye said.\n\nContributing: Joey Garrison",

        "text": "Mass. presidential election 2024: Everything you need to know to vote\nFollow live updates from GBH reporters in the field and live results here.\n\nFrom voting for the next president to ballot questions about important local issues, Massachusetts voters will soon get the chance to weigh in on Nov. 5, as the country heads to the polls for the general election. Here\u2019s what you need to know to cast your ballot.\n\nJump to how to vote in person\n\n\n\nImportant dates\n\nMark these key dates on your calendar:\n\n\n\nOct. 26, 2024: Deadline to register to vote\n\nDeadline to register to vote Oct. 29, 2024: Deadline to apply for vote by mail\n\nDeadline to apply for vote by mail Nov. 5, 2024: General election. Polls will be open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.\n\nEarly voting also takes place in the weeks before, but exact dates vary by municipality.\n\n\n\nHow to register to vote\n\nThe first step to vote in the general presidential election is to make sure you are registered. If you have never registered before, want to switch political parties, recently became a citizen or if you\u2019ve moved since the last time you voted, even if it\u2019s within the same district, you need to register to vote.\n\nYou can register to vote online, by mail or in person. Learn more here to access the necessary forms, or check with your local election office. You\u2019ll need to provide a driver\u2019s license, state ID or social security number to register, or you may be asked, in certain situations such as if it\u2019s your first time voting, to show documents with your name such as a bank statement or utility bill when you go to vote in-person.\n\nWhen you register to vote, you\u2019ll be asked if you want to enroll in a party or stay unenrolled.\n\nAnyone can register, as long as you are:\n\n\n\n18 years old, or will be 18 by the time of the election (you can pre-register when you\u2019re 16)\n\nA U.S. citizen and resident of Massachusetts\n\nNot currently incarcerated for a felony\n\nIf you\u2019re doing certain things at the Registry of Motor Vehicles or MassHealth, such as applying to renew your driver\u2019s license or applying for MassHealth benefits, you may be automatically registered to vote. But if you\u2019ve moved recently, you still need to re-register.\n\nDeadlines: You must register by Oct. 26 for the general election.\n\nIssues, statewide ballot questions and candidates on your ballot\n\nMassachusetts voters will be casting votes for president, as well as U.S. senator, U.S. representative, governor\u2019s councilor, state senator, state representative, clerk of courts, register of deeds and various other local offices.\n\nPresident\n\nVice President Kamala Harris is the Democratic candidate for president and her running mate is Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. President Joe Biden endorsed Harris after he exited the race in July. Harris previously served as a U.S. senator and the attorney general of California.\n\nIn her acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention, Harris pushed her vision of an \u201copportunity economy\u201d and called for more optimism. \u201cWith this election, our nation has a precious, fleeting opportunity to move past the bitterness, cynicism, and divisive battles of the past. A chance to chart a new way forward \u2014 not as members of any one party or faction, but as Americans,\u201d she said.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is running on the Republican side and his running mate is U.S. Sen. JD Vance, an Ohio politician who emerged on the national stage after writing the bestselling book \u201cHillbilly Elegy.\u201d In his speech accepting the nomination at the Republican National Convention, just under a week after an assassination attempt, Trump said, \u201cUnder our leadership, the United States will be respected again. ... No nation will question our power. No enemy will doubt our might. Our borders will be totally secure. Our economy will soar. We will return law and order to our streets, patriotism to our schools, and importantly, we will restore peace, stability and harmony all throughout the world.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Trump and Harris, Massachusetts voters will see candidates representing four other parties on their ballot: Shiva Ayyadurai, an independent, Jill Stein from the Green-Rainbow Party, Claudia De la Cruz from the Party for Socialism and Liberation, and Libertarian Chase Oliver.\n\n\n\nU.S. Senator\n\nU.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren is running for reelection, and has emphasized the importance of keeping Democratic control. \u201cThe Republican efforts in the House and the Senate to have a nationwide abortion ban will have new life. It means cuts to Medicare and Social Security will be back on the table. And it means that billionaires will get even more tax cuts,\u201d Warren said on GBH\u2019s Boston Public Radio.\n\nJohn Deaton, a former U.S. Marine and cryptocurrency attorney, is running for the Senate seat as a Republican. He has said Warren is more \u201cloyal to the Democratic Party\u201d than her constituents, and that he would be an \u201cindependent voice\u201d in Congress who is willing to break with his party on some issues.\n\nWarren and Deaton will face each other at a GBH News/New England Public Media debate on Oct. 17.\n\n\n\nBallot questions\n\nQuestion 1 has been spearheaded by State Auditor Diana DiZoglio. If passed, it would expand the auditor\u2019s investigative power and allow her office to audit the Massachusetts Legislature.\n\nQuestion 2 concerns the MCAS exam. If passed, this measure would remove the graduation requirement for Massachusetts public school students to pass the 10th grade exam. Students would still take the exam, but schools would use their own graduation criteria. The Massachusetts Teachers Union is pushing the measure, arguing that standardized tests aren\u2019t the best way to measure students\u2019 abilities. Some parents\u2019 groups oppose the measure, saying that it helps ensure that high standards are met by all students.\n\nQuestion 3 would allow rideshare drivers at companies like Uber and Lyft to form unions and push for better wages and working conditions. Several unions like Local 32BJ are supporters of the measure. Some opponents say it could increase the cost of rides. This measure would not apply to other gig workers like DoorDash and InstaCart.\n\nQuestion 4 would legalize some natural psychedelics, like psilocybin. It would allow people to grow them at home, and create ways for adults to take them under professional supervision. Advocates say psychedelics help with conditions like depression and PTSD. Opponents say the way the measure is written doesn\u2019t provide enough specific standards for the treatment facilities or home cultivation, and it could be very expensive for people who want to use the products.\n\nQuestion 5 would increase the base pay for tipped workers in Massachusetts, implemented gradually over five years until their wage reaches the state\u2019s minimum wage. Customers would still be able to leave tips. Proponents say a higher tipped wage would help tipped workers like servers have more stable incomes, and potentially equalize pay between \u201cfront of house\u201d and \u201cback of house\u201d workers. Opponents include tipped workers who worry they would receive fewer tips and less pay overall. Some restaurants say that menu prices may go up to compensate for the higher wages, or they may have lower profits.\n\nCities and towns may have their own ballot questions, too. You can preview your ballot here.\n\n\n\nYour options for voting\n\nOnce you\u2019ve registered and done your research on the issues and candidates, it\u2019s time to vote.\n\nAbsentee voting and vote by mail\n\nIf you won\u2019t be home on Election Day, are serving in the military or living overseas, are currently incarcerated, or you have religious beliefs or a disability that prevent you from voting in person at your polling place, you may be eligible to vote with an absentee ballot. You can apply by mail, email or fax through your local election office. You\u2019d be using the same ballots as voters who vote by mail and need to meet the same deadlines.\n\nAll other voters are entitled to vote by mail for any reason, as long as you\u2019re already registered to vote. Every Massachusetts resident should be sent an application in the mail before the election. You can also apply online.\n\nDeadlines: You must apply to vote absentee or by mail no later than Oct. 29.\n\nOfficials urge voters to apply as early as they can to allow enough time for the mail to arrive. While you\u2019re waiting, you can use the online ballot tracker to follow the status of your ballot.\n\nYou can also choose to return your mail-in ballots in person at your city or town\u2019s local election office or ballot drop boxes \u2014 but not your polling location on Election Day. View Boston\u2019s locations around the city.\n\n\n\nEarly voting\n\nIf you prefer to vote in person, you can get a head start and vote early, no reason needed. You don\u2019t need to vote at your designated polling location, unlike on Election Day.\n\nIn Boston, early voting will take place from Saturday, Oct. 19, through Friday, Nov. 1. Here\u2019s a map of early polling sites and drop boxes.\n\nYou can also find information about early voting locations and hours in Brookline, Cambridge, Chelsea, Somerville, Springfield and Worcester.\n\nLive in another city? Check out the secretary of state\u2019s website for a searchable list.\n\n\n\nVote in person on Election Day\n\nYou can always vote in person on Election Day, Nov. 5. Polls will be open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Find your polling location here and view your ballot.\n\nIn most cases, you will not be asked to show an ID to vote. There are only some cases, like if you\u2019re voting for the first time, that a poll worker may ask to see your ID. Your proof of identification can be a license, recent utility bill or a copy of your rental lease.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have your ID with you, it\u2019s your right to request a provisional ballot. You can then return to the polling location before it closes to have your ID verified and your vote counted.\n\nYou can also cast a provisional ballot if your name isn\u2019t on the list at your polling location. You can ask the poll worker to call the local election office to confirm your registration.\n\n\n\nHow to vote if you\u2019re a college student\n\nIf you\u2019re a college student in Massachusetts, you have a choice on where you vote: at your permanent address in your home state, or at your student address, whether it\u2019s an off-campus address or a dorm. Registering to vote on your campus address does not impact your financial aid or your parents\u2019 tax dependent status. Just remember you can only be registered at one address, and you need to re-register every time you change addresses.\n\nIf you do want to vote at your college address, follow all of the above steps to register before Election Day.\n\nIf you want to vote at your permanent address, you probably have to vote absentee, so check with your home election office and make sure you apply for a ballot early.\n\nMany colleges in the state, including UMass, provide resources and host registration drives to help students get involved in the democratic process in the leadup to an election, so check with your school.\n\nHow to vote if you have a disability\n\nMassachusetts requires that all polling locations are physically accessible, which should include accessible parking and entrances. Poll workers should be trained to assist voters with disabilities. Every location should have an AutoMARK voting machine for voters to cast their ballot independently. You also have the right to bring someone with you to help in any part of voting.\n\nVoters with disabilities are entitled to request an accessible ballot when you fill out the application to vote by mail. Voters with disabilities also now have the option to submit their ballot electronically.",

        "text": "7 \u2018October Surprises\u2019 That Disrupted US Presidential Elections\nPresidential candidates have always understood that in a close election, any big news story in the last weeks of a campaign could be enough to tip the contest in November. Now known as an \u201cOctober surprise,\u201d the news story might take the form of a scandalous revelation about a candidate, the outbreak of war or economic turmoil, or even a fake story planted by a political enemy.\n\nAs early as the 1840 election, New York Democrats in support of President Martin Van Buren waited until mid-October to accuse the Whig party of paying Pennsylvanians to vote in New York, a key swing state. A whig official even admitted to the scheme, but it wasn\u2019t the bombshell scandal Democrats had hoped for. Van Buren still lost New York and the election.\n\nAmerica 101: What is a Swing State?\n\n\u201cWhat the idea of the \u2018October surprise\u2019 suggests, above all, is that the proximity to the election is when big news can move the needle,\u201d says David Greenberg, a political historian and journalist at Rutgers University. \u201cThe truth is, voters make up their minds based on a mixture of impressions, personalities, partisan loyalties, ideological leanings, as well as news and issues. It's never easy to say precisely that this one thing made the difference.\u201d\n\nBelow are seven examples of memorable (or anticipated) \u201cOctober surprises\u201d in U.S. presidential history.\n\n1. A Forged Letter Almost Becomes Garfield\u2019s \u2018Death Warrant\u2019 (1880)\n\nGetty Images / Pictures from History / Contributor White House portrait of James A. Garfield\n\nChinese immigration was a hot-button issue in the 1870s. In just a decade, more than 120,000 Chinese men and boys came to the United States under contract to work the railroads. Western states in particular were anxious about the influx of foreign labor and Democrats called for an immediate moratorium on Chinese immigration.\n\nRepublican candidate James Garfield took a more measured position, calling for new negotiations with China and for Congress to consider reasonable limitations on Chinese immigration that, \u201cwithout violence or injustice, will place upon a sure foundation the peace of our communities and the freedom and dignity of labor.\u201d\n\nBut just 12 days before the 1880 election, a letter emerged. Allegedly written by Garfield on House of Representatives stationary, the Republican candidate told a Massachusetts businessman named H.L. Morey that \u201cindividuals and companies have the right to buy labor where they can get it cheapest.\u201d In other words, unrestricted Chinese immigration is good for business.\n\nDemocrats printed half a million copies of the \u201cMorey letter\u201d and distributed them in tightly contested states like California. They called it Garfield\u2019s \u201cdeath warrant.\u201d\n\nRepublicans were slow to respond, but sent a team of private investigators to track down the letter\u2019s recipient in Massachusetts. There was no H.L. Morey. Garfield declared the letter a forgery and published his handwriting side-by-side with the letter to prove it was a fake.\n\nThe forged letter did real damage, though, costing Garfield California. Although Garfield eventually won the election 214 electoral votes to 155, he barely won the popular vote by .02 percentage points.\n\n2. FDR Almost Loses the Black Vote (1940)\n\nThe 1936 election signaled a landmark shift for Black voters. Prior to 1936, Black voters were loyal Republicans, the party of Lincoln. But as more African Americans moved out of the South to northern cities, they joined other racial and ethnic minorities fighting for better jobs and working conditions. After the Great Depression struck, Black voters flocked to Democratic Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal programs.\n\nFDR carried 71 percent of the Black vote in 1936 and he hoped to do the same in 1940, but public opinion had changed. As America prepared for entry into World War II, Black Americans were appalled that segregation was still the norm in the U.S. military, and that FDR had done nothing about it. Meanwhile, FDR\u2019s Republican opponent, Wendell Wilkie, was a vocal champion of civil rights.\n\nOn October 28, a high-profile incident threatened to cost FDR the Black vote for good. The president was campaigning in New York City at an event in Madison Square Garden. As FDR left for the train station, one of his staffers\u2014a short-tempered press aide named Stephen Early\u2014was blocked by two police officers. In a violent outburst, Early kneed one of the cops in the crotch. The officer, James Sloan, was Black.\n\nAs Sloan was rushed to the hospital, Early\u2014the descendent of a Confederate general\u2014issued a half-hearted apology. \u201cA policeman appears to have been hurt,\u201d Early told the press. \u201cI did not attack or kick any officer. But since one officer believes I was responsible for hurting him, I wish to apologize\u2026 I cannot understand why Republican politicians are attempting to find political significance in this incident.\u201d\n\nTwo days before the election, FDR tried to salvage the situation by announcing the creation of the Tuskegee Airmen and promoting Colonel Benjamin O. Davis Jr. to brigadier general, the first Black officer to reach that rank.\n\nFDR ended up winning an unprecedented third term as president and only lost a small percentage of the Black vote.\n\n3. Reagan Campaign Coins the Term \u2018October Surprise\u2019 (1980)\n\nIran Hostage Crisis\n\nInterestingly, the term \u201cOctober surprise\u201d was coined during an election where there wasn\u2019t an actual October surprise.\n\nIn 1980, the Iranian Hostage Crisis cast a shadow over the presidential election. More than 50 American citizens were held hostage at the American Embassy in Tehran with no political solution in sight. Election Day would mark a full year of their captivity.\n\nRonald Reagan campaigned on a promise to free the hostages, something that President Jimmy Carter\u2019s administration had failed to do. But inside the Reagan campaign, there was mounting suspicion that Carter had actually secured the hostages\u2019 release, but was waiting to announce it during the final weeks of the campaign.\n\nIt was William Casey, Reagan\u2019s campaign manager, who dubbed Carter\u2019s alleged scheme an \u201cOctober surprise.\u201d\n\nTime magazine reported, \u201c[Reagan\u2019s campaign] expects [Carter] to pull what they call \u2018the October surprise,\u2019 meaning that shortly before Election Day, he will inflate the importance of some overseas event in an attempt to rally the country around him.\u201d\n\nThat didn\u2019t happen, of course. Election Day came and went, the hostages remained in Tehran and Reagan won handily. The real surprise came on January 20, when Iran released the hostages just hours after Reagan's inauguration. Democrats then accused Reagan of striking a secret deal with Iran to hold the hostages until after he took office.\n\n4. Kissinger Prematurely Announces \u2018Peace\u2019 in Vietnam (1972)\n\nHenry Kissinger holds a press conference Oct. 26, 1972. Credit: Getty Images U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger holds a press conference Oct. 26, 1972 at which he says that agreement on a cease-fire in Vietnam is near.\n\nThe Vietnam War was the major political issue of both the 1968 and 1972 elections. Even though the term \u201cOctober surprise\u201d hadn\u2019t been coined yet, the idea was very much a political phenomenon. In both 1968 and 1972, incumbent presidents tried to secure last-minute peace deals to swing the election in their favor.\n\nIn 1968, President Lyndon Johnson chose not to run for reelection, but he was committed to helping his Democratic vice president, Hubert Humphrey, defeat the Republican candidate, Richard Nixon. On October 31, 1968, LBJ ordered a halt to all U.S. bombing campaigns in Vietnam, announcing \u201ca major step toward a firm and an honorable peace in Southeast Asia.\u201d\n\nBut just days later, the peace talks in Vietnam fell apart and Humphrey lost to Nixon. Democrats alleged that Nixon secretly scuttled the talks by promising the South Vietnamese stronger support if he were elected president. (Casey, who later coined \u201cOctober surprise,\u201d was a Nixon aide in 1968.)\n\nFour years later, the Vietnam War was still raging and Nixon was adamant about securing peace before Election Day 1972. In early October, there appeared to be a breakthrough in the peace talks with the North Vietnamese accepting America\u2019s terms for an end to the conflict. Behind the scenes, though, the South Vietnamese strongly objected to the arrangement.\n\nThat didn\u2019t stop Henry Kissinger, Nixon\u2019s national security advisor, from attending a press conference on October 26 and proclaiming that \u201cpeace is at hand.\u201d In reality, the war would continue for another three years.\n\n\u201cIt was big news,\u201d says Greenberg. \u201cToday we would definitely call it an \u2018October surprise,\u2019 even though they weren't using that phrase back then.\u201d\n\nNixon was already heavily favored to win in 1972, but Kissinger\u2019s premature \u201cpeace\u201d announcement may have contributed to his landslide victory.\n\n5. Iran-Contra Indictment Is Bad News for George H.W. Bush (1992)\n\nIn 1992, President George H.W. Bush was fighting to hold onto the White House, but he faced some serious challenges. For starters, the U.S. economy was mired in a recession, never a good place for the incumbent. On top of that, the 1992 race saw the first serious third-party challenge in decades. Billionaire Ross Perot was running as a fiscal conservative and siphoning Republican voters away from Bush.\n\nIf Bush had hopes of defeating his Democratic challenger, Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, they took a serious hit in June 1992. That\u2019s when Caspar Weinberger, who served as Secretary of Defense under President Reagan, was indicted for his involvement in the Iran-Contra Affair.\n\nIran-Contra Affair\n\nWhat\u2019s the connection with Bush? Bush was Reagan\u2019s vice president and had been trying to distance himself from the scandal, in which Reagan allegedly authorized illegal weapons sales to Iran in order to funnel money to the Contras, an anti-socialist army in Nicaragua.\n\nWeinberger was the biggest name to be charged in the case, giving credence to the idea that everyone in the Reagan administration knew about the crime, including Bush. While Weinberger\u2019s indictment didn\u2019t happen in October, the timing was still bad for Bush, who lost the election to Clinton.\n\nGreenberg says that the bad economy and the failure of Reaganomics were the biggest factor in Bush\u2019s loss, but admits that \u201cyou never quite know what goes on in the mind of individual voters as they make their decisions close to Election Day.\u201d\n\nBush pardoned Weinberger before he left office.\n\n6. A DUI Almost Derails George W. Bush (2000)\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the 2000 presidential election, polls showed that the race was a dead heat between George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore. That\u2019s exactly the type of election that could be decided by an \u201cOctober surprise.\u201d\n\nJust days before Election Day\u201a Fox News broke a bombshell story. In 1976, George W. Bush was arrested for drunk driving in Maine after a long night of partying. The revelation seemed to confirm unflattering portrayals of the younger Bush as unfit for office.\n\n\u201cI'm not proud of that,\u201d Bush told the press in a statement. \u201cI made some mistakes. I occasionally drank too much, and I did that night. I learned my lesson.\u201d\n\nThe news story was a last-minute gift to Gore, who won the popular vote in 2000, but famously lost the election after a recount in Florida was halted by the Supreme Court.\n\nRepublican strategist Karl Rove argued that Bush\u2019s \u201cOctober surprise\u201d cost him five states in the 2000 election, enough to have avoided the Florida recount altogether.\n\n7. FBI Reopens Probe into Clinton\u2019s Emails (2016)\n\nThe 2016 election was chock-full of wild \u201cOctober surprises.\u201d On October 7, the Washington Post released a 2005 video of Republican candidate Donald Trump bragging about sexually assaulting women. That same day, Wikileaks released transcripts of Hillary Clinton\u2019s speeches to Wall Street donors, which painted the Democratic candidate as pro-corporate. Then The New York Times reported that Trump hadn\u2019t paid federal taxes in 18 years.\n\nBut all of those bombshell news items paled in comparison to what happened on October 28, just 11 days before the election. James Comey, the FBI director, called a press conference to announce that the intelligence agency was reopening its investigation into Clinton\u2019s private email server\u2014an investigation that the FBI had officially closed in July.\n\nThe resurrection of the email investigation\u2014which had been the target of Republican ire for a year\u2014delivered a crippling blow to the Clinton campaign. (In her memoir, Clinton said that Comey had \u201cshivved\u201d her.) Clinton lost the election by a narrow margin, despite winning the popular vote.\n\n\u201cThere's been a lot of political science research about what they call \u2018recency.\u2019 That is to say, a big scandal in July probably is not going to matter that much, at least to most people, unless it completely derails a candidate,\" says Greenberg. \"But the same scandal a week or two before the election, it sticks.\u201d",

(A new NPR/PBS News/Marist poll indicates the trend is likely to continue in the 2024 general election.)\n\nAn analysis of the 2020 election by the MIT Election Data and Science Lab concluded that the differences in how quickly counties reported their results were \u201cdriven by the fact that smaller and more rural counties, which favored Trump, could report their ballots before the counties with hundreds of precincts and hundreds of thousands of voters.\u201d\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIt took longer for many of those larger counties to report results because of the big batches of mail-in ballots they received, the analysis found. In some states, allowing absentee ballots that arrive after Election Day to be counted also slowed down counting.\n\nAnd there\u2019s another wonky factor to consider \u2014 whether a state\u2019s laws allow election officials to process mail-in ballots before Election Day.\n\n\n\nSome state election laws slow the counting of mail-in ballots\n\nThere\u2019s an in-the-weeds process in election administration that\u2019s called \u201cpre-canvassing.\u201d\n\nIt involves all of the steps needed to prepare mail-in ballots for scanning, including checking voters\u2019 signatures on return envelopes, opening those envelopes and flattening the ballots inside.\n\nWhen this processing is allowed to start varies depending on the state, and the MIT analysis found that states with laws that allow pre-canvassing before Election Day were faster to report results in 2020.\n\nFor this year\u2019s presidential election, the states that do not allow processing before Election Day include two key swing states: Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nWhile Arizona allows processing as soon as a completed ballot is received, election officials in that swing state say there are likely to be reporting delays because hundreds of thousands of voters are not expected to drop off their mail ballots until Election Day.\n\nStill, some election watchers say the experience election officials have gained with mail-in ballots since the 2020 election, and some 2020 mail-in voters returning to in-person voting, could help reduce the time needed to finish counting this year.\n\nBut especially if the presidential race turns out to be close in any states, extra patience may be needed before voters see the true colors of the 2024 electoral map.\n\nEdited by Benjamin Swasey",

An ensuing war has proved the existential role the US plays in Israel\u2019s survival but also severely strained the alliance. It has also exposed and widened some of America\u2019s most profound political divides ahead of an already tumultuous election between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump next month.\n\nThe October 7, 2023, Hamas terror attacks, which killed 1,200 people, did not just transform the Middle East\u2019s strategic balance as Israel confronted Hamas, then Hezbollah, and traded fire with their sponsor, its archenemy, Iran. Like the September 11 attacks in 2001, the Hamas horror set off a chain of events that affected countless lives, unleashing political disturbances thousands of miles away.\n\nMilitarily, the United States and its allies have twice staged unprecedented operations to protect Israel from a barrage of missiles and drones from Iran. The US has also repeatedly bombed Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen who have launched attacks on international shipping in the Red Sea in the wake of October 7. Amid fears in Washington of a full-on Middle East war, the vulnerability of US troops in the region was tragically driven home in January when three US service personnel were killed in an attack on a base in Jordan.\n\nAt home, the fallout of the Hamas attacks has coincided with the toxic politics of a presidential election year. Campus protests underscored the splits in the Democratic Party, which soon saw unprecedented political upheaval with Biden abandoning his reelection bid and backing Harris just months before the election. In the new race between Harris and Trump, events in the Middle East continue to set off reverberations that could influence the outcome of the election.

        "text": "US warns voters of disinformation deluge\nAmerican voters are likely about to be swamped by a flood of misinformation and influence campaigns engineered by U.S. adversaries aiming, according to senior U.S. intelligence officials, to sway the results of the upcoming presidential election and cast doubt on the process itself.\n\nThe latest assessment from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, issued Monday, comes just 29 days before the November 5 election that will see U.S. voters choose the country's next president and cast ballots in hundreds of other state and local races.\n\n\"We've continued to see actors ramp up their activities as we get closer to Election Day,\" said a senior U.S. intelligence official, briefing reporters on the condition of anonymity.\n\n\"They recognize that individuals are already voting, and operations can have a greater impact as we get closer to Election Day,\" the official said, noting that the election itself may just be a starting point.\n\n\"The intelligence community expects foreign influence actors to continue their campaigns by calling into question the validity of the election results after the polls close,\" the official added.\n\nA second U.S. intelligence official warned the pace of such influence efforts, especially those targeting specific races or political campaigns, has also picked up.\n\n\"We have had more than a threefold increase,\" the official said, explaining that the number of private briefings to candidates and campaigns has likewise jumped.\n\nIntelligence agencies also cautioned that U.S. adversaries will likely seize upon the damage done by Hurricane Helene and potential damage from Hurricane Milton as it strengthens off the U.S. coastline to further amplify and manufacture narratives meant to undermine confidence in the election results.\n\n\"It does take time for those types of narratives to be formed and put out into the wild, so to speak,\" the first intelligence official said. \"But we certainly expect foreign countries to take advantage of such situations and promote further divisive rhetoric.\"\n\nMonday's assessment follows a series of earlier public warnings about foreign efforts to meddle in the U.S. election.\n\nU.S. officials said Monday that Russia, Iran and China continue to be responsible for most of the influence efforts targeting U.S. voters.\n\nAnd, they said, there have been no indications that any of those countries have changed their goals.\n\nRussia, they said, continues to run influence campaigns aimed at boosting the chances of former U.S. President and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, while seeking to hurt the campaign of Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee.\n\nIran's efforts remain focused on helping Harris by hurting Trump, they said, pointing to the ongoing hack-and-leak operation against the Trump campaign, which has been traced to three operatives working for Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.\n\nTargeting state, local races\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies assess that China has yet to wade into the U.S. presidential campaign, focusing instead on persuading American voters to reject state and local candidates perceived as detrimental to Beijing's interests, especially those voicing support for Taiwan.\n\nBut the latest public assessment pointed to some changes.\n\nU.S. intelligence officials on Monday warned that Russia and Cuba have joined China, in targeting congressional, state and local races.\n\n\"Moscow is leveraging a wide range of influence actors in an effort to influence congressional races, particularly to encourage the U.S. public to oppose pro-Ukraine policies and politicians,\" the intelligence official said.\n\n\"Havana almost certainly has considered influence efforts targeting some candidates,\" the official added. \"This is consistent with what they've done in past cycles.\"\n\nRussia, China and Iran have all rejected previous U.S. accusations of election meddling. Russia, Iran and Cuba have yet to respond to requests from VOA for comment on the latest U.S. findings.\n\nChina late Monday again dismissed the U.S. concerns.\n\n\"China is not interested in the U.S. congressional election, and we have no intention and will not interfere in it,\" Liu Pengyu, the spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, told VOA in an email.\n\n\"Some U.S. congressmen stick to their wrong positions on the Taiwan question,\" Liu added. \"China firmly defends its national sovereignty and territorial integrity, but this does not lead to the conclusion that China has interfered in the congressional elections.\"\n\nBut the U.S. intelligence assessments align with concerns voiced by some lawmakers and private technology companies.\n\n\"The 48 hours after the polls close, especially if we have as close an election as we anticipate, could be equally if not more significant in terms of spreading false information, disinformation and literally undermining the tenets of our democracy,\" Mark Warner, chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said during a hearing last month.\n\n'Vigorous activity'\n\nMicrosoft President Brad Smith, who has warned that the most perilous moments could come in the 48 hours before the U.S. election, separately said the increase in malign cyber efforts by Russia and Iran, especially, is undeniable.\n\n\"We're seeing vigorous activity,\" Smith told a cyber conference last month. \"We're seeing the Iranians really target the Republican Party in the Trump campaign,\" he said. \"We're seeing the Russians target the Democratic Party and now the Harris campaign.\"\n\nAnd it is unclear what impact the U.S. has made with its attempts to counter the growing number of foreign influence efforts.\n\nLast month, the U.S. Justice Department seized 32 internet domains used by companies linked to Moscow to spread disinformation. At the same time, the department indicted employees of the state-controlled media outlet RT in connection with a plot to launder Russian propaganda through a U.S.-based media company.\n\nU.S. intelligence officials on Monday, however, said such tactics are no longer unique to the Kremlin.\n\n\"Foreign influence actors are getting better at hiding their hand and using Americans to do it,\" said one of the U.S. intelligence officials. \"Foreign countries calculate that Americans are more likely to believe other Americans compared to content with clear signs of foreign propaganda.\"\n\nArizona Democratic Senator Mark Kelly told CBS' \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday that social media is rife with fake personas generated by U.S. adversaries.\n\n\"If you're looking at stuff on Twitter, on TikTok, on Facebook, on Instagram, and it's political in nature \u2026 there is a very reasonable chance \u2014 I would put it in the 20 to 30% range \u2014 that the content you are seeing, the comments you are seeing, are coming from one of those three countries: Russia, Iran, China,\" he said. \"It's not going to stop on November 5.\"",

        "text": "30 Day Election Security Update from the Intelligence Community\nTHE WASHINGTON FOREIGN PRESS CENTER, WASHINGTON, D.C.\n\nMODERATOR: Hello, and welcome to the Washington Foreign Press Center\u2019s briefing on election security 30 days before Election Day. My name is Gini Staab at the U.S. Department of State, and I\u2019m the moderator for today\u2019s briefing. This briefing is on background. On the call today we have several experts. They will self-identify, and you can attribute their remarks to an ODNI official.\n\nBy participating in today\u2019s call, you are agreeing to these ground rules. We will share the transcript of this briefing later today. For journalists joining us, please take a moment to rename yourself in the chat with your name, outlet, and country.\n\nAnd with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to ODNI. Thank you so much.\n\nODNI OFFICIAL ONE: Hi there. Can I start with a mike check first? Can you hear me?\n\nMODERATOR: Sounds good. Thank you so much, yes.\n\nODNI OFFICIAL ONE: Okay. I\u2019m going to try to speak up, but if you can\u2019t hear me, please let me know.\n\nOur update today focuses mostly on foreign actors seeking to influence races other than the one for president. Before we get into those details, I\u2019ll begin by setting the scene. Today is 29 days out from Election Day, and a range foreign actors continue to try to influence U.S. elections as we approach November. These activities include broad efforts aimed at undermining trust in U.S. democratic processes and exacerbating divisions in our society, while also seeking to shape voter preferences towards specific candidates.\n\nOur assessments about the activities and goals of Russia, Iran, and China are unchanged from earlier election security updates.\n\nOn the presidential race, the Intelligence Community continues to assess that Russia prefers the former president and Iran prefers the Vice President. We also continue to assess that China is not seeking to influence the presidential election.\n\nAs we approach Election Day, the Intelligence Community is also stressing that foreign efforts to undermine America\u2019s democracy won\u2019t end on November 5th. The Intelligence Community expects foreign influence actors to continue their campaigns by calling into question the validity of the election\u2019s results after the polls close. These foreign actors are almost certainly considering the possibility of another contested presidential election in a tight contest for control of both the Senate and the House of Representatives. Thus, in such a contested post-election atmosphere, foreign actors probably will use tactics similar to those they are using today to undermine trust in the integrity of the election and election processes, as well as to further exacerbate divisions among Americans.\n\nNow, turning to foreign efforts to target congressional and other races, the Intelligence Community assesses some foreign actors \u2013 particularly Russia, China, and Cuba \u2013 are supporting or denigrating candidates involved in congressional, state, and local races. To determine which candidates to support or oppose, foreign actors evaluate how they think an individual candidate\u2019s foreign policy positions affect their national security interest.\n\nI\u2019ll start by talking about the big three actors we\u2019ve been tracking to date and moving on to others.\n\nFirst, Russia: Moscow is leveraging a wide range of influence actors in an effort to influence congressional races, particularly to encourage the U.S. public to oppose pro-Ukraine policies and politicians. Russian influence actors have planned, and likely created and disseminated, content, particularly over social media, intended to encourage the election of congressional candidates that Moscow assesses will oppose aid to Ukraine.\n\n(Simultaneous telephone call begins.)\n\nODNI OFFICIAL ONE: China: Beijing is seeking to influence congressional races and candidates, regardless of political affiliation, perceived by Beijing to threaten its core interests, especially in relation (inaudible) to Taiwan.\n\nIran: The IC has not observed Tehran seeking to influence congressional or state and local races during this election cycle. This is consistent with Iran\u2019s approach in 2020, though the IC continues to monitor \u2013\n\nMODERATOR: [ODNI Official One], I\u2019m sorry to interrupt you. Just one second. We have a call going on there as well that we can hear through your mike. Okay, so \u2013 sorry, [ODNI Official One], could you just pick that up again, please?\n\nODNI OFFICIAL ONE: Yeah. Stand by one moment.\n\n(Simultaneous telephone call concludes.)\n\nODNI OFFICIAL ONE: Thanks very much. I think the mike caught all of that.\n\nMODERATOR: Yes, sorry. That was quite loud. Yep.\n\nODNI OFFICIAL ONE: Okay. This has got to be on my phone.\n\nMODERATOR: Stand by, everyone, please.\n\nODNI OFFICIAL ONE: All right, we\u2019re going to try it again. (Inaudible) hearing me okay?\n\nMODERATOR: Yes, just until the telephone call.\n\nODNI OFFICIAL ONE: Okay.\n\nMODERATOR: Thank you so much.\n\nODNI OFFICIAL ONE: All right. I\u2019m not really sure. Maybe go back to Russia? Any sense to where we \u2014\n\nMODERATOR: Yes, right there would be great. Mm-hmm.\n\nODNI OFFICIAL ONE: All right. Apologies for that. We\u2019re having some audio issues today. So Russia. Moscow is leveraging a wide range of influence actors in an effort to influence congressional races, particularly to encourage the U.S. public to oppose pro-Ukraine policies and politicians. Russian influence actors have planned and likely created and disseminated content, particularly over social media, intended to encourage the election of congressional candidates that Moscow assesses will oppose aid to Ukraine.\n\nChina. Beijing is seeking to influence congressional races with candidates, regardless of party affiliation, perceived by Beijing to threaten its core interests, especially in relation of relations with Taiwan.\n\nIran. The IC has not observed Tehran seeking to influence congressional or state and local races during this election cycle. This is consistent with Tehran\u2019s approach in 2020, though the IC continues to monitor for any change to its strategy.\n\nThe IC is also monitoring other foreign actors who are conducting or have considered influence operations to support or oppose specific candidates beyond the presidential race. These operations are typically focused on particular candidates, tailored for specific demographics or constituencies, and use tactics such as posting on social media platforms, seeding articles in the U.S. media, or illicitly funding campaigns.\n\nCuba, for example, probably views this year\u2019s election as consequential. Havana almost certainly has considered influence efforts targeting some candidates. Havana may be, as it has done in previous cycles, trying to curry favor from congressional and sub-national politicians that it believes will support its preferred policies.\n\nI\u2019m going to pass to my colleague now.\n\nODNI OFFICIAL TWO: Hi. Thanks very much for joining us on this call. We\u2019re releasing this this election security update as part of our efforts to proactively share information about foreign threats to U.S. elections. As you\u2019ve heard, the election security update we\u2019re releasing today addresses foreign adversary efforts to undermine trust in our democratic institutions and to shape voter preferences.\n\nSince our last update, ODNI has continued to work alongside its interagency partners to proactively address foreign threats to U.S. elections. We continue to brief critical stakeholders, including Congress, state and local election officials, candidates, campaigns, and committees to exchange information with industry on evolving foreign threat actor tools, tactics, and procedures, to ensure that both we and they have an up-to-date perspective on the landscape and to provide (inaudible) and the broader \u2013 excuse me \u2013 up-to-date information on foreign threats to our elections. We will continue to publicly release as much information as possible, as we are today. We will issue our next election security update 15 days ahead of the election. Thank you.\n\nMODERATOR: I\u2019m sorry, just one more interruption. We can\u2019t hear you, and a couple of the journalists are just saying they can\u2019t hear. Is it possible for you to get closer to the mike? I apologize.\n\nODNI OFFICIAL TWO: Okay, hi. Is this better?\n\nMODERATOR: Excellent. Thank you so much.\n\nODNI OFFICIAL TWO: Okay, great. Hi. So thanks very much for joining us on this call. As I said, we\u2019re releasing this election security update today as part of our efforts to proactively share information about foreign threats to our elections. As you\u2019ve heard, the document addresses foreign adversary efforts to undermine trust in our democratic institutions and to shape voter preferences.\n\nSince our last update, ODNI has continued working alongside interagency partners to proactively address foreign threats to U.S. elections. We continue to brief critical stakeholders, including Congress, state and local election officials, candidates, campaigns, and committees, to exchange information with industry on evolving foreign threat actor tools, tactics, and procedures to ensure that both we and they have an up-to-date perspective on the landscape and to provide up-to-date information on foreign threats to our elections.\n\nWe will continue working to publicly release as much information as possible, as we are doing today, and we\u2019ll issue our next election security update 15 days ahead of the election. Let me turn it back to you now, Jenny, to carry us forward.\n\nMODERATOR: Thank you so much and that was excellent. Wonderful. We really appreciate the audio was perfect there at the end. So thank you so much for those remarks and now I\u2019d like to open it up for questions. As a reminder to journalists, please be sure your screenname includes your name and media outlet. To ask a question, click the raised hand icon on the bottom of your screen or type your question in the chat. We had \u2013 did have a couple advance questions that I\u2019d like to ask first. One is from Oskar Gorzynski from the Polish Press: \u201cDo you have any assessment on how successful Russian influence operations have been to date, and how confident are you about the safety of voting systems and procedures from foreign interference?\u201d\n\nODNI OFFICIAL ONE: Hi there. Can you hear me okay now?\n\nMODERATOR: Wonderfully. Thank you.\n\nODNI OFFICIAL ONE: All right. The U.S. Intelligence Community does not evaluate the effectiveness of foreign influence operations because doing so would require us to evaluate protected free speech in the United States. So that is not a role for the Intelligence Community. As far as the safety of voting systems and procedures, what I would say there is we have not seen foreign efforts to date to attack the integrity of voting systems. A lot of the activity we\u2019re seeing so far is influence \u2013 influence operations or information operations, and some of those operations do question the integrity of the voting, if that distinction is clear.\n\nMODERATOR: Thank you so much. Our next question comes from Saurabh Shukla from NewsMobile, India. \u201cAre you aware of any disinformation campaign targeting election integrity from bad actors in Russia and China, and how are you dealing with this?\u201d\n\nODNI OFFICIAL ONE: As far as disinformation campaigns, we would say yes, there are information campaigns from some of these actors, particularly Russia and Iran, that seek to question the legitimacy or the integrity of the election, including election systems. And as we noted in our opening remarks, we expect these actors to continue their information operations after election day and after polls close to question the legitimacy of the election. And I\u2019ll turn to my colleague for anything to add on what we do about it.\n\nODNI OFFICIAL TWO: Sure. Hi. I mean, I can just add that our efforts with this election security update and others is to provide as much information as we can with the broader public about the types of activity that we\u2019re seeing. When we have intelligence about a particular threat, one that might target a particular individual, we have the ability to provide what we call defensive briefing or private notification directly to the target or the conduit about influence operations so that they can take steps to protect themselves and to mitigate that activity. Thanks.\n\nMODERATOR: Thank you so much. And we\u2019ll now turn to Rahim Rashidi from Kurdistan TV, Iraq. Please unmute yourself and ask your question.\n\nQUESTION: Yeah, thank you very much for this opportunity. We have seen several reports indicating that Iranian actors have tried to hack U.S. officials and interfered in the U.S. presidential election campaign. I know you\u2019re talking about Russia and China as well, but I am focused on Iran. How serious is this threat and what should the U.S. response be? Thank you very much.\n\nODNI OFFICIAL ONE: Hi there. Your statement is correct. Iran poses a significant foreign influence threat to U.S. elections. Our assessment is Iran continues efforts to fuel distrust in U.S. political institutions and increase social discord and, of course, as you noted and a variety of U.S. Government indictments and public statements have noted, efforts to influence the presidential race through the hack-and-leak operation against former President Trump.\n\nMODERATOR: Thank you very much. Nuaman Ishfaq Mughal from Parliament Times. Do you have a question, please?\n\nQUESTION: Thank you very much. Nuaman Ishfaq Mughal from Pakistan. My question is that in last month State Department sanctioned official Russian TV outlet RT for interference in election. Was any significant damage was done by RT before the sanctions?\n\nODNI OFFICIAL ONE: Hi there. As to your question about damage, that gets into the effectiveness of operations. But I\u2019m happy to talk a bit about the way Russia conducts these operations or their approach, and their approach is essentially to better hide their hand. Russia uses a variety of techniques to obscure that it\u2019s Russian influence operations, and they conduct these operations through two primary means.\n\nOne is they use influence-for-hire firms, or commercial firms with expertise in these type of activities. So \u2013 and the other is to coopt witting and unwitting Americans to work on Russia\u2019s behalf, and those were some of the activities you highlighted. And both of these efforts are designed to launder their influence narratives through what are perceived as more authentic U.S. voices.\n\nMODERATOR: Thank you so much. And now we\u2019ll turn to Paolo Mastrolilli from La Repubblica, Italy.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you very much for the briefing. This year while also a significant election here in Europe, in several country. I was wondering if during your research you noticed also some malignant activity to interfere with democracy in Italy and in other European country. What did you notice and what should European country do in order to defend themselves?\n\nODNI OFFICIAL ONE: Yeah, that is a little outside the scope of the briefing. I apologize that we\u2019re not able to provide information on that today.\n\nMODERATOR: Thank you. And we have another advance question with regards to congressional elections. \u201cWhat are you seeing in congressional elections in the battleground states, and do you \u2013 are you assessing that that is making a difference in the outcomes of these elections?\u201d\n\nODNI OFFICIAL ONE: Russia in particular has targeted swing states for a variety of its influence efforts, and a lot of the operations we see across the country, but in swing states in particular, are information operations to include social media activity, fake websites that purport to be U.S. news websites, and similar activity. And again, we cannot comment on the effectiveness of these operations.\n\nMODERATOR: Thank you. And you\u2019ve mentioned that Cuba has now entered the fray or is considering entering the fray into elections interference. Can you speak a little bit about Cuba and their experience in this election?\n\nODNI OFFICIAL ONE: Yes, sure. Havana is very focused on a few policy issues that it believes to be negatively impacting the regime, particularly the U.S. embargo on Cuba and other economic and travel restrictions, all of which Havana perceives as an effort to force regime change. Havana considers election influence activities as part of its standing requirements to influence those policies, and Florida is a prime target of their activities. To that end, we have observed Cuba tailoring influence activities based on its perception of a candidate\u2019s stances on policies toward Cuba. For example, in 2020 Havana intended to denigrate specific candidates in Florida and pushed influence narratives to the Latin American community in the United States.\n\nMODERATOR: Okay, thank you so much. Unfortunately, that\u2019s all the time our briefers have for today. This ends our Q&A session. As a reminder, this briefing has been on background and you can attribute their remarks to ODNI officials. I want to give a special thanks to our briefers for sharing their time with us today, and to the journalists who\u2019ve joined us via Zoom. Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s briefing.",

        "text": "Harris Appears on \u201860 Minutes\u2019 With Just 1 Month Left in Race: Oct. 7 Campaign News\nVice President Kamala Harris is holding a series of interviews and other media appearances this week.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris sat for an interview with \u201c60 Minutes\u201d that was broadcast on Monday night and, in a departure from some of her recent appearances on cable news and podcasts, she was repeatedly pressed on questions she did not initially answer.\n\nDuring a sit-down with the show\u2019s correspondent Bill Whitaker, Ms. Harris did not reveal new domestic policy proposals or share how she would pay for some of those she has already put forward. But she did expound on her views about two foreign leaders causing enormous headaches for President Biden\u2019s administration: Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, and Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president.\n\nLess than a month before Election Day, Ms. Harris\u2019s interview with CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d \u2014 the longstanding most-watched news program on television \u2014 came at a moment of increased exposure and pressure. She is set to appear on three major shows on Tuesday and at a Univision town-hall event on Thursday that is aimed at Spanish-speaking viewers.\n\nHere are seven takeaways from Ms. Harris\u2019s appearance on \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d which also interviewed her running mate, Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota.\n\nHarris was in control of her message, but avoided repeated pushback.\n\nFrom the opening seconds, Ms. Harris seemed calm and in command of the points she wanted to make \u2014 and she did not stray from them despite repeated follow-up questions. She avoided pushback when asked to detail how to end the yearlong war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. And she declined repeatedly to say whether the Biden-Harris administration should have acted earlier to restrict illegal immigration into the United States.\n\nWhen Mr. Whitaker asked her if the administration had lost all sway over Mr. Netanyahu, Ms. Harris said, \u201cThe work that we do diplomatically with the leadership of Israel is an ongoing pursuit around making clear our principles.\u201d\n\nMr. Whitaker pushed again: \u201cIt seems that Prime Minister Netanyahu is not listening.\u201d\n\nMs. Harris responded, \u201cWe are not going to stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end\u201d \u2014 an answer that did not address the volatile diplomatic tension at the heart of the question.\n\nShe has a Glock, and she knows how to use it.\n\nSince beginning her short, intense campaign, Ms. Harris has offered up few new details about herself, but on Monday she answered a couple of questions about being a longtime gun owner.\n\nShe said she owned a Glock, a popular pistol that is the handgun of choice for many in law enforcement \u2014 perhaps fitting for a former California attorney general, San Francisco district attorney and a local prosecutor before that.\n\n\u201cLook, my background is in law enforcement,\u201d she said, \u201cand so there you go.\u201d\n\nYes, the vice president said with a laugh, of course she had fired the weapon. She quickly added: at a shooting range.\n\nHarris was pressed about \u2018dealing with the real world\u2019 on some of her plans.\n\nMs. Harris was asked several times about her plans to pay for her economic proposals, including a $6,000 child tax credit for families with infants. She vowed to raise taxes on the highest earners before Mr. Whitaker pushed back: \u201cWe\u2019re dealing with the real world here,\u201d he said. She said she believed that congressional leaders were privately willing to engage on the issue.\n\n\u201cWhen you talk quietly with a lot of folks in Congress, they know exactly what I\u2019m talking about,\u201d she said, ignoring a reality she has encountered as Mr. Biden\u2019s No. 2: Discussions in private that seem promising do not always lead to public policy.\n\nStill, Ms. Harris said she would need Congress to act on several proposals, including legislation that would continue to restrict immigration to the United States.\n\nShe has warned Tim Walz about misspeaking.\n\nImage Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota has made news lately for misstatements about his personal history. Credit... Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times\n\nWhen Mr. Walz has been in the news lately, it has been about his misrepresentations of his military record and travels to China.\n\nIt was perhaps an acknowledgment of these distractions from the carefully crafted Harris campaign agenda when Mr. Walz, after being asked about disagreements he has had with his running mate, said that she had told him to button up some of his loose language.\n\n\u201cShe said, \u2018Tim, you know, you need to be a little more careful on how you say things,\u2019\u201d Mr. Walz said.\n\nHe said any embellishments he had made paled in comparison to those of Mr. Trump, whom he called \u201ca pathological liar.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will own up to being a knucklehead at times,\u201d he said. \u201cThe folks closest to me know that I keep my word.\u201d\n\nNeither Liz Cheney nor Harris can quite believe they are allies now.\n\nDuring a brief exchange at Ms. Harris\u2019s event last week in Wisconsin with former Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, Mr. Whitaker asked the vice president what she would have said if someone had suggested four years ago that she would someday be campaigning with the archconservative Ms. Cheney.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019d be great,\u201d Ms. Harris said, laughing.\n\nMs. Cheney laughed, too. \u201cShe\u2019s really diplomatic,\u201d she said.\n\nMr. Whitaker then posed the same question to Ms. Cheney. Could she believe she was here, speaking at a campaign event for Ms. Harris?\n\nThe former Wyoming congresswoman couched her support as vital to preventing Mr. Trump\u2019s return to office.\n\n\u201cI hope that if you had said to me four years ago, \u2018Our Constitution is going to be under threat and it\u2019s going to be crucial for the parties to come together and to support Vice President Harris because she\u2019ll defend the rule of law,\u2019 I know I would\u2019ve said, \u2018That\u2019s exactly what I\u2019ll do,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nHer foreign policy would look a lot like Biden\u2019s.\n\nDiscussing the diplomatic crises that have unfolded throughout the Biden administration, including the expanding Mideast conflict and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Ms. Harris signaled that foreign policy in a Harris-Walz administration would hew closely to the policies of the Biden-Harris one.\n\nMs. Harris said she would not meet with Mr. Putin about ending the war in Ukraine without involving the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nShe again warned of what could happen if her Republican rival were in office: \u201cDonald Trump, if he were president, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv right now. He talks about, \u2018oh, he can end it on Day 1.\u2019 You know what that is. It\u2019s about surrender.\u201d\n\nBut Ms. Harris did not hesitate when asked which foreign country was \u201cour greatest adversary.\u201d Iran, she said, is \u201cthe obvious one.\u201d\n\n\u201cIran has American blood on their hands,\u201d she said, though she twice declined to engage in what she called hypothetical questions about what sort of military action she would take overseas.\n\nTrump turned down \u201860 Minutes.\u2019 Harris took advantage.\n\nOn the CBS show on Monday, Mr. Whitaker said Mr. Trump had agreed to an interview, then backed out, citing, among other things, the network\u2019s promise to fact-check him on the air.\n\nMs. Harris pounced on the opportunity to point out that Mr. Trump \u201cis not going to give your viewers the ability to have a meaningful, thoughtful conversation, question-and-answer with you.\u201d\n\nTo get an idea of the substance of Mr. Trump\u2019s policies, she said, \u201cWatch his rallies. You\u2019re going to hear conversations that are about himself and all of his personal grievances.\u201d",

        "text": "Officials in North Carolina, Georgia say Helene will not derail voting in presidential election\nOfficials in North Carolina, Georgia say Helene will not derail voting in presidential election\n\nElection officials in Georgia and North Carolina said Monday that voting from their states in the presidential election in November will not be derailed by the damage left by Hurricane Helene even as crews continue to search for victims.\n\nThough parts of the two states were devastated by the hurricane, election officials said they are working on plans to assure that every ballot cast for the Nov. 5 election will be counted.\n\n\u201cWhat has been on everyone\u2019s mind is what will happen to elections,\u201d Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said at a news conference Monday. \u201cGood news: Absentee ballots are going out this week as scheduled, and early voting will start next Tuesday, on Oct. 15.\"\n\nThe streets are flooded near Peachtree Creek after hurricane Helene brought in heavy rains over night, Sept. 27, 2024, in Atlanta. Megan Varner/Getty Images\n\nRaffensperger said that while Helene caused widespread damage and power outages in his state, he does not expect there to be any major disruptions to the general election. He said election offices and voting equipment in the state's 159 counties escaped serious damage.\n\nBlake Evans, elections director for the Georgia secretary of state\u2019s office, said county officials are assessing about 2,400 polling locations. So far, just three will have to be changed because of storm damage, he added.\n\nIn North Carolina, the state's Board of Elections unanimously approved on Monday a measure that would broaden the authority of local election officials in the counties most impacted by the disaster.\n\nBrad Raffensperger, Georgia's secretary of state, attends The Principles First 2024 Summit: Conserving America's Liberal Tradition, at the in Washington, D.C., Feb. 24, 2024. Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call via Getty Images\n\nThe approved measure will allow election officials in 13 of the hardest-hit North Carolina counties to make changes to voting sites, access emergency supplies and deploy teams to assist with absentee voting at disaster shelters ahead of early voting commencing on Oct. 17.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to ensuring that we open early voting on the 17th in all 100 counties, including these affected counties. It may look a little different in these affected counties, but we fully intend to offer early voting starting on the 17th,\" said Karen Brinson Bell, executive director of the North Carolina Board of Elections.\n\nAs of Monday, every county election office in North Carolina was opened, according to Bell, compared to last week when 14 of those offices were closed due to the storm. Bell thanked local election officials throughout the state for working to get their offices online while facing \u201cpersonal struggles\u201d including damage to their homes, transportation issues and a lack of basic utilities.\n\n\u201cWhat a difference a week makes ... this is just quite the feat,\u201d Bell said. \"Our struggles are not over, and that is why we need the Board to take action to give the flexibility necessary to carry out these elections, and to be of the best service to the voters that we can be.\"\n\nShe told reporters Monday that authorities could bring in National Guard tents or FEMA trailers to act as polling locations, and she insisted that it can be done securely and safely.\n\n\"It\u2019s not as spacious as your normal polling location, but it does provide the space necessary at the existing voting site if the parking lot [of a polling site is] still accessible,\" she said. \"[And] even in a temporary structure we can still maintain security of the voting equipment and safety of our workers.\u201d\n\nAn aerial view of flood damage along the French Broad River in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, Oct. 2, 2024, in Asheville, N.C. Mario Tama/Getty Images\n\nIn Yancey County, North Carolina, Board of Elections Director Mary Beth Tipton told ABC News that officials are still assessing how many of the county\u2019s 11 polling sites would be operational by Election Day. Most of the other polling sites are in schools and fire stations, which are currently being used as shelters and emergency relief sites, and two election stations were severely damaged by flood waters.\n\n\u201cThere are some of them that don\u2019t even exist anymore,\u201d Tipton said.\n\nOne of the hardest-hit counties was Buncombe County, which sustained historic flooding. The county includes Asheville, the eleventh-largest city in the state.\n\nAs of Monday, 67,000 utility customers remained without electricity and a large part of Buncombe County was without running water due to major damage to the water system and its water treatment plant, officials said. Recovery crews continued to search massive piles of debris for 60 people who remain unaccounted for, officials said.\n\n\"I'm here to reassure our community that Buncombe County will vote,\" Corinne Duncan, the director of Buncombe County Election Services, said at a news conference Monday.\n\nDuncan said she was concerned that some polling places would have to be changed due to the lack of water or power. She said most of the election offices and voting equipment were spared by the storm, but officials are working to \"strategize and modify plans\" to make sure anyone who wants to vote can do so.\n\nShe said officials are trying to get in touch with polling workers for training to make sure polling stations are staffed. As of now, early voting will begin as planned in Buncombe County and residents still have until Oct. 11 to register to vote, Duncan said.\n\n\"We are assessing what voting locations are available,\" said Duncan, adding, \"We must respect the gravity of our situation.\"",

The term does not yet have the blockbuster potential of the term that ended in July . Guns are again on the docket as are cases involving gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors, disability discrimination and federal regulation of vapes .",
        "text": "A new Supreme Court term begins in the shadow of a presidential election\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of trepidation,\u201d said David Cole, national legal director of the ACLU, referring to election cases reaching the high court. \u201cIf the election is close, then there\u2019s a whole set of questions about voter access, counting ballots. I don\u2019t think the court wants to get involved, but it may be forced to.\u201d\n\nBut the new docket has enough cases that promise to keep the justices in the public eye in the months ahead. Guns are again on the docket as are cases involving gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors, age restrictions for access to online porn, disability discrimination and federal regulation of vapes. And the 2024 presidential election hovers over the docket like a dark cloud on a bright autumn day, pregnant with possible voting issues that may demand the court\u2019s attention.\n\nThe new term does not yet have the blockbuster potential of the term that ended in July. The prior term was packed with controversy, including three cases related to former President Donald Trump, gun regulation, two abortion cases, federal agencies\u2019 power, voting rights, a major opioid-related bankruptcy, social media regulation and more.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court opens a new term on the eve of an intense, historic election in which the justices may be called on to play a key role in the results.\n\nSome court scholars said the less intense docket this term may reflect the justices\u2019 desire to create space for post-election cases, if necessary.\n\n\u201cThey had to make space for the possibility\u201d there would be election cases, said Irv Gornstein, executive director of the Supreme Court Institute at Georgetown University Law Center. \u201cThey had to have that on their minds.\u201d\n\nIf Trump is elected, he suggested, there is a possible challenge to his holding office based on the insurrection clause in the 14th Amendment \u2014 even though the justices may have thought they ruled out such a case in their decision last term in a Colorado ballot case. And if Trump isn\u2019t elected, Gornstein added, \u201cThere\u2019s almost certainly a number of immunity cases they will have to decide\u201d related to ongoing criminal cases, a consequence of their separate decision last term awarding immunity for a president\u2019s \u201cofficial acts.\u201d\n\nWATCH: How the Supreme Court immunity ruling reshapes presidential power\n\nThe term also opens at a time when public approval of the institution is the lowest in decades. A series of ethics-related revelations involving Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito have damaged the court\u2019s image. Although the justices have adopted an ethics code after continuing outside criticism of them for lacking one, the new code does not have an enforcement mechanism. And sharply ideologically divided votes in culture-war cases appear to lend credence to some of the public\u2019s belief that the court is a partisan institution.\n\nBut for now, the justices are doing business as usual. They added 15 cases to their argument docket on Sept. 30 when they met to examine more than 1,000 petitions that had been filed over the summer or that had lingered from last term. They will continue to add to the docket until about mid-January when they traditionally have filled argument slots through April.\n\nHere is a brief look at key cases thus far that will be argued between now and the end of April.\n\nMore guns\n\nLast term, the court ruled that the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives could not ban bump stocks under the definition of \u201cmachine guns\u201d in federal law. This term, the justices face a similar case involving regulation of \u201cghost guns.\u201d Kits can be purchased online that allow anyone to assemble a gun quickly and without background checks. These ghost guns have no serial numbers and are largely untraceable.\n\nThe bureau issued a rule in 2022 that the definition of \u201cfirearm\u201d under the Gun Control Act of 1986 includes weapon parts kits that can be \u201creadily\u201d assembled into a firearm. The rule also states that the term \u201cframe or receiver,\u201d as referenced in the act\u2019s \u201cfirearm\u201d definition, includes \u201ca partially complete \u2026 frame or receiver.\u201d A lower court found that the bureau had exceeded its authority in issuing the rule. The Biden administration appealed to the Supreme Court (Garland v. Van der Stok.)\n\nThe second gun-related case, Smith & Wesson Brands v. Estados Unidos Mexicanos, came to the court from Mexico. That country charged Smith & Wesson and Interstate Arms with aiding the illegal trafficking of firearms to drug cartels in Mexico. A lower court refused to dismiss Mexico\u2019s suit under a 2005 federal law that shields gunmakers from liability for crimes committed with their guns.\n\nA transgender health care ban and reverse discrimination\n\nTennessee, like 25 other Republican-controlled states, passed legislation banning medical treatments intended to allow \u201ca minor to identify with, or live as, a purported identity inconsistent with the minor\u2019s sex\u201d at birth or to treat \u201cpurported discomfort or distress from a discordance between the minor\u2019s sex and asserted identity.\u201d In taking on United States v. Skrmetti, the justices agreed to decide whether the law discriminates on the basis of sex in violation of the equal protection clause.\n\nThe justices will also decide a woman\u2019s claim (Ames v. Ohio Dept. of Youth Services) that she was denied a promotion because she is heterosexual and her former boss, a gay woman, instead advanced two LGBTQ+ people. Marlean Ames, an Ohio government employee, challenges a court-imposed requirement that \u201cmajority\u201d Americans raising discrimination claims must demonstrate \u201cbackground circumstances,\u201d such as statistical evidence of a pattern of discrimination against a majority group, before their suits can proceed.\n\nFree speech and online porn access\n\nIn 2023, Texas joined a growing number of states that have passed laws requiring websites that publish sexual material deemed \u201charmful to minors\u201d to verify their users\u2019 age before they can access anything on the site. The Texas law also requires covered sites to prominently publish \u201csexual materials health warnings\u201d written by the government.\n\nIn Free Speech Coalition v. Paxton, the justices will decide what type of scrutiny \u2014 rational basis or strict scrutiny \u2014 to apply to the law, which the challengers contend unconstitutionally burdens users and compels speech..\n\nA fight over vapes\n\nWages and White Lion Investments makes flavored e-liquids containing nicotine for use in e-cigarettes, such as vapes. The company sought marketing approval from the Food and Drug Administration to continue making and selling its products. But the FDA denied premarketing approval after finding that the products did not show strong, reliable evidence to overcome the risks of youth addiction and benefits to adult smokers.\n\nThe company has challenged the FDA\u2019s denials, claiming it lacked authority to impose those requirements and acted arbitrarily and capriciously. A lower appellate court agreed with the company, and the FDA turned to the Supreme Court (FDA v. Wages and White Lion Investments).\n\nNot in my backyard!\n\nThe justices will return to an old and thorny issue: where to store nuclear waste. Texas challenged the Nuclear Regulatory Commission\u2019s plan to store 40,000 metric tons of waste in Texas\u2019 Permian Basin. A lower federal appellate court ruled that the federal agency did not have the authority to issue licenses to store the waste away from reactors.\n\nThe case, Nuclear Regulatory Commission v. Texas, could become another chapter in the conservative majority\u2019s recent efforts to rein in the power of federal regulatory agencies.",

Game theory explains how people make decisions when their choices depend on others' actions. Chiang's lecture explores key concepts like the Nash equilibrium, different types of games such as the prisoner\u2019s dilemma and chicken games, and how these ideas apply to elections and everyday decisions. How voting structures influence campaign strategies, with U.S. presidential candidates often appealing to the \"average voter\" due to the way general elections work will also be examined.\n\nChiang received his Ph.D. in Economics from the University of Florida in 2002 and joined the faculty at Florida Atlantic University in 2003. Over his 20-year career at FAU, he served as the Director of Instructional Technology for the College of Business and taught over 18,000 students from Introductory to Ph.D.-level economics courses.

Chiang has published 42 peer-reviewed journal articles and is the author of Economics: Principles for a Changing World, a textbook currently in use at 85 colleges and universities.\n\nChiang also serves on the advisory board for Global Traveler magazine and has visited over 100 countries. In his spare time, Chiang competes in mini-golf tournaments and is a member of the U.S. Pro Mini Golf Association. In 2019 he competed in the first season of ABC\u2019s game show Holey Moley with NBA star Stephen Curry.\n\nTomi Ovaska, professor of economics at YSU and the Paul J.

Endowed chairs are faculty positions supported by dedicated funds, enabling scholars to pursue advanced research and teaching in their field of expertise, while also fostering community engagement and collaboration in the academic and economic community.\n\nThe Paul J. Thomas Chair in Economics is supported by an endowment established to honor the donors' father, Paul J. Thomas. Thomas was born and raised in Niles, Ohio. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree from Yale and continued his education at Boston University and Ohio State University.\n\nIn 1939 he began employment with Packer Thomas as a CPA. Thomas joined the Navy during World War II, earning the rank of Lieutenant. He returned to the Mahoning Valley after the war and went onto a business career of great distinction. In addition to his service at Packer Thomas Certified Public Accountants and Business Consultants, he was vice president of Superior Industries and vice president of Easco Corporation.\n\nThe public can attend the Paul J.

Just 3% of voters remain undecided a month before Election Day.In the state\u2019s Senate race, Democratic incumbent Elizabeth Warren is easily outpacing Republican nominee John Deaton 59%-35%, with 6% of voters still undecided. At 60%, Warren\u2019s job approval tops every other major candidate among voters polled, including Governor Maura Healey (58%), Kamala Harris (57%), Joe Biden (56%), and Donald Trump (35%).Of the five ballot questions voter will face, 71% of Massachusetts voters said they would vote to grant the state auditor the authority to audit the legislature, while just 16% opposed the measure.The second question would eliminate the MCAS examination as a high school graduation requirement, and when asked if they supported this measure, 58% responded \u201cyes,\u201d and 37% responded \u201cno.\u201dQuestion 3, which would provide unionization for transportation network drivers, received support from 59% of voters, with 34% saying \u201cno.\u201dVoters were nearly equally split on the fourth question, to legalize certain natural psychedelic substances, with 47% \u201cyes\u201d and 46% \u201cno.\u201d Another high-profile ballot referendum, Question 5, which seeks to raise the minimum wage for tipped workers and allow employers to pool tips for nonmanagement workers, was narrowly opposed by those surveyed, 52%-40%.The Suffolk University and The Boston Globe statewide survey of 500 residents was conducted October 2-6, and is based on live interviews of registered voters in Massachusetts who indicated they were very or somewhat likely to vote this November. Each area\u2019s quota and demographic information\u2014including party affiliation, gender, race, and age\u2014were determined from presidential exit polls and 2022 census data. The 14 Massachusetts counties were grouped into four general regions. The margin of sampling error for results based on the total sample is +/- 4.4 percentage points. Suffolk University student Zoe Toperosky contributed to the poll summaries for this survey. Marginals and full cross-tabulation data are posted on the Suffolk University Political Research Center website. For more information, contact David Paleologos at 781-290-9310, [email protected]",

        "text": "Kais Saied set to win Tunisia presidential election: Exit poll\nThe incumbent in the lead with 89.2 percent of votes with voter turnout in Sunday\u2019s election at 28 percent.\n\nTunisian President Kais Saied is on course to win the presidential election with 89.2 percent of the vote, according to an exit poll aired on state TV, solidifying Saied\u2019s rule after a power grab three years ago.\n\nThe Independent High Authority for Elections of Tunisia (ISIE) will announce the official results of the election on Monday evening.\n\nSaied, 66, was running against two rivals, including his former ally turned critic Chaab Party leader Zouhair Maghzaoui, and Ayachi Zammel, a businessman who was seen as posing a big threat to Saied\u2019s re-election until he was jailed last month.\n\nAccording to the exit poll, Maghzaoui, 59, got 3.9 percent of the vote and 47-year-old Zammel, 6.9 percent.\n\nThe ISIE said voter turnout stood at 27.7 percent in Sunday\u2019s vote. The board\u2019s spokesman, Mohamed Tlili Mansri, said earlier that they were expecting it to be about 30 percent.\n\nSenior figures from the country\u2019s most prominent political parties, who largely oppose Saied, have faced imprisonment on various charges and have not publicly backed any of the three candidates on the ballot.\n\nJailed opposition figures include Rached Ghannouchi, the head of the opposition Ennahda party, which dominated politics after the 2011 \u201cArab Spring\u201d protests to oust President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali.\n\nAccording to rights groups, since 2019, when Saied was elected, the president has undone democratic gains for the country that were secured through the revolution.\n\nSaied has rejected the criticism, arguing that his actions were to fight a \u201ccorrupt elite\u201d and \u201ctraitors\u201d.\n\nPolitical tensions grew in Tunisia ahead of the election after an electoral commission named by the president disqualified three candidates amid protests by opposition and civil society groups.\n\nAt the same time, Tunisia is experiencing weak economic growth, high inflation, and unemployment, which have also caused protests.\n\nLast week, lawmakers loyal to Saied stripped the administrative court of authority over election disputes.\n\nThe court is seen as the country\u2019s last independent judicial body after Saied dissolved the Supreme Judicial Council and dismissed several judges in 2022.\n\nIn 2021, Saied dissolved the elected parliament and rewrote the constitution in a move the opposition dubbed a coup.\n\nThe rewritten constitution was put to a referendum vote and passed on voter turnout of only 30 percent. The January run-off for the new parliament Saied created with that constitution only achieved 11 percent voter turnout.",

        "text": "Harris embarks on media blitz and tries to edge out Trump in key swing states\nKamala Harris has embarked on a week-long media blitz, hurtling from TV studios and late-night shows to podcast interviews as she seeks to gain an edge over Donald Trump in the US election\u2019s key battleground states that remain nail-bitingly close.\n\nThe vice-president\u2019s decision to face a raft of largely friendly media outlets came as the campaigns entered the final 30 days. More than 1.4 million Americans have already cast their ballots in early voting across 30 states.\n\nThe Democratic nominee\u2019s whirlwind media tour has been carefully crafted for maximum reach and minimum risk. Harris has talked to the CBS News show 60 Minutes, along with the popular podcast Call Her Daddy.\n\nOn Tuesday she hits the media capital, New York, for appearances on ABC News\u2019s daytime behemoth The View and the Howard Stern Show, followed by a recording with the late-night host Stephen Colbert.\n\nThe first of a flurry of comments from Harris was put out by 60 Minutes on Sunday before a full broadcast on Monday. Harris will appear alone, after Trump declined to be interviewed by the election special which has been a staple of US election coverage for more than half a century.\n\nIn a short clip released by 60 Minutes, Harris was asked whether the Biden-Harris administration had any sway over the actions of Benjamin Netanyahu, the hardline prime minister of Israel who appears not to listen to Washington. Asked whether the US had a \u201creal close ally\u201d in Netanyahu, she replied: \u201cWith all due respect, the better question is: do we have an important alliance between the American people and the Israeli people? And the answer to that question is yes.\u201d\n\nSince Harris\u2019s meteoric propulsion as Democratic presidential nominee after Joe Biden stepped aside, her relative avoidance of press or TV interviews has become a point of contention on the campaign trail. Republican leaders and pundits on Fox News routinely accuse her of being media-shy.\n\nThis week\u2019s blitz is designed to counter that impression, while reaching large audiences focused on demographic groups which will be central to Harris\u2019s chances of winning in November. Call Her Daddy is Spotify\u2019s most listened to podcast among women, while The View is the number one ranked daytime talk show with 2.5 million average viewers, again heavily weighted towards women.\n\nMeanwhile Colbert\u2019s show on CBS is the highest rated late-night talk show attracting large numbers of younger viewers aged 18 to 49 \u2013 another critical demographic on Harris\u2019s target list.\n\nHarris\u2019s running mate, the Democratic governor of Minnesota, Tim Walz, is also making his own media scramble which began on Sunday, with him entering less comfortable territory on Fox News Sunday. He was questioned about the pro-abortion rights law that he signed in his state, and also asked to clarify the occasions on which he has misrepresented his record.\n\nThat included a comment that he had carried weapons in war when he had not, and his classifying the treatment that he and his wife received to have a child as IVF when it was in fact a different type of fertility treatment.\n\nAt last week\u2019s vice-presidential debate Walz recognised his missteps, calling himself a \u201cknucklehead\u201d.\n\nWalz told Fox News Sunday: \u201cTo be honest with you, I don\u2019t think American people care whether I used IUI or IVF, what they understand is that Donald Trump would resist these things. I speak passionately \u2026 I will own up when I misspeak and when I make a mistake.\u201d\n\nAs the contest enters its final month, the Guardian\u2019s latest tracker of opinion polls shows Harris up on Trump by three percentage points nationally. In the more telling test of the seven battleground states that will decide the outcome, though Harris is ahead in five of them, the margin remains essentially too close to call.\n\nBoth candidates and their running mates are speeding up their frantic dash around the seven states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Harris and Walz will be in Arizona this week, where early voting begins on Wednesday.\n\nOn Thursday, the Democratic ticket will gain extra ballast when the former president and campaigning superstar Barack Obama kicks off a round of stump appearances in the all-important swing state of Pennsylvania. He will begin in Pittsburgh, and will then travel across the country on Harris\u2019s behalf, campaign aides have said.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Stakes \u2014 Presidential Transition Free newsletter We will guide you through the aftermath of the US election and the transition to a Trump presidency Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Trump and his younger son Eric used the occasion to spread the baseless claim that the Democrats had been behind the attempt on his life.\n\n\u201cThey tried to kill him, it\u2019s because the Democratic party can\u2019t do anything right,\u201d Eric Trump said. The billionaire Elon Musk also appeared on stage.\n\nOn Sunday, Mike Johnson, the Republican speaker of the US House, was asked by ABC News\u2019s This Week whether such comments were responsible amid mounting fears of political violence in the build up to the 5 November election. Johnson sidestepped the question, saying he had not heard the full speeches.\n\nThe speaker also notably refused to answer whether Trump had lost the 2020 election, in the wake of Trump\u2019s ongoing lies that he was the actual victor. \u201cThis is the game that is always played by the media with leading Republicans, it\u2019s a gotcha game, and I\u2019m not going to engage in it,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nThe former president\u2019s wife, Melania Trump, sat down for an interview with the Fox News host Maria Bartiromo. She was asked given how close her husband had come to being shot in Butler whether she trusted the top officials of the FBI, CIA and other federal agencies who \u201cappeared to be against President Trump and yourself from day one\u201d.\n\nMelania Trump replied: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say who you really trust. You want to, but it\u2019s always a question mark.\u201d\n\nMelania Trump, who is promoting her book, Melania, also spoke about her pro-abortion rights stance which she revealed in the volume. She said her husband had always known her convictions.\n\n\u201cHe knew my position and my beliefs since the day we met, and I believe in individual freedom. I want to decide what I want to do with my body. I don\u2019t want government in my personal business,\u201d she said.",

Harris vs Trump: US citizens can bet on whether Trump or Harris wins the election at Interactive Brokers and Kalshi.(AP)\n\nThis development comes after federal appeals court in Washington, DC, permitted a prediction market to conduct election betting ahead of the November 5 election, refusing a government watchdog\u2019s attempt to block a verdict that cleared the way for legal political gambling in the United States.\n\nFollowing the court's decision, Kalshi, an online betting platform, reopened its congressional control contracts, allowing citizens to wager on whether the Republican or Democratic party will control the House and Senate in 2025.\n\nThree judges found unanimously on October 2, Wednesday that neither the Commodity Futures Trading Commission nor the general public \u201cwill be irreparably harmed while its appeal is heard.\u201d The Commission had claimed that the wagers were unlawful and could compromise the fairness of elections.\n\nKalshi has long maintained that the contracts serve the public interest by giving precise information for predicting elections and enabling individuals to diversify their bets on various results. The portal has also highlighted the growth of Polymarket, an unregulated, offshore cryptocurrency-based prediction market that gained prominence after the CNN June debate. Users have wagered over $1 billion on the presidential contest on Kalshi.\n\nThe court rendered its decision over two weeks ago after the panel heard arguments for the lifting of Kalshi's congressional contracts suspension.\n\nThe judges questioned the agency for hours about whether the markets would compromise the integrity of the November elections.\n\nSpeaking to CNN, Kalshi lawyer Yaakov Roth emphasized the advantages of a platform, stating that elections have important economic ramifications that \u201creal people want to hedge.\u201d\n\nHe further explained, \u201cThe election itself causes certain companies to increase in value or decrease in value, that is the risk, and so to hedge that risk, you would want to buy an event contract that accommodates that and that accounts for that.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: Trump calls his team \u2018so stupid\u2019, faces \u2018embarrassment\u2019 as new footage appears to show how fans ditched him: Watch\n\nLegal prediction markets are Live now\n\nOn Friday morning, October 4, trading began on the first regulated marketplaces that permitted bets on the presidential fight between Harris and Trump. Interactive Brokers and financial exchange startup Kalshi were the leading brokers in this market.\n\nSome traders will be able to wager up to $100 million on Kalshi. Additionally, both businesses allow traders to wager on which party will hold the Senate and House in 2025. In addition to other swing states, Interactive Brokers offers markets for the Senate contests in Wisconsin, Arizona, and Ohio.\n\nThe website of Kashi shows that the chance of Harris winning this election is 51 percent, while Trump's 49 percent. It features questions like \u201cwho will win the presidential race?\u201d and \u201cwho will win the Senate race in Wisconsin?\u201d\n\n\u201cPolitics is a very hot topic for a lot of people. They have strong beliefs one way or another,\u201d stated Interactive Brokers senior vice president Steve Sanders, as per Politico. \u201cSo, since the elections are in the news, we think that this could be a catalyst to really get things going.\u201d\n\nKamala Harris is ahead of Donald Trump in the White House race, as per betting platform Kalshi.\n\nShortly after the platform's opening, Interactive Brokers' platform saw the trading of over 500,000 contracts related to the presidential contest, a firm representative said. On the other hand, over $300,000 worth of contracts were traded in Kalshi's presidential markets, according to the company website.\n\nHere's how Americans can bet on elections\n\nUS citizens can bet on whether Trump or Harris wins the election at Interactive Brokers and Kalshi. In each scenario, a user can buy contracts that pay out around $1 in case his bet is correct and nothing if the bet is wrong.\n\nMeanwhile, the WSJ reports that their prices are subject to change in response to speculators' evaluations of the likelihood of a Trump or Harris victory.",

The term 'October Surprise' has become a jargon since the 1980s used by political pundits to denote an important event, deliberate or planned, that could undermine one candidate's prospects while proving to be a push for the other in the US Presidential election .

        "text": "Why October Surprise has terrified US presidential candidates for decades\n\"I anticipate something will happen in October, as it always does... There will be concerted efforts to distort and pervert Kamala Harris, who she is, what she stands for, what's she's done,\" warned Democrat Hillary Clinton. The warning from the former Secretary of State came in early October with the US Presidential Election less than a month away.\n\nAs Hillary Clinton warned Harris, she summoned the infamous 'October Surprise'. After all, she knows what the 'surprise' can do to a presidential candidate.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBeing on the receiving end of the 'surprise' in 2016, Hillary Clinton faced a two-month campaign wherein several emails and excerpts of her were released on Wikileaks, that ultimately proved a blow to her Oval Office ambitions.\n\n'October Surprise', which denotes a course-changing event before the US Presidential election, could impact the upcoming race as the Middle East crisis unfolds, along with criticism of the Biden-Harris administration's response to Hurricane Helene and protests by dockworkers.\n\nBut first let's look up where the 'Surprise' comes from and how it entered the American political lexicon.\n\nWHAT IS THE OCTOBER SURPRISE?\n\nThe term 'October Surprise' appeared in the early 20th century, to refer to a department store clothing sale advertised in newspapers, taking place during the fall (autumn), according to the Merriam-Webster dictionary.\n\nLater on, it got a political touch in the US, a nation obsessed with slangs.\n\n'October surprise' has become a jargon since the 1980s, commonly used by political pundits to denote an important event, deliberate or planned, that could undermine one candidate's prospects while proving to be a push for the other in the US Presidential election. The event typically occurs in the month leading up to the crucial November election, giving it the 'October' in 'October surprise' and defining the term.\n\nAlthough coined by Republican Ronald Reagan's campaign manager William Joseph Casey during the 1980 presidential campaign, significant election-altering events in October had occurred even before the term was coined.\n\nDuring the 1980 presidential election, Republican Reagan alleged that a last-minute agreement to release the American hostages in Iran could provide incumbent President Jimmy Carter with enough support to secure re-election. However, things turned against Carter and he lost.\n\nThe 'October Surprise', that has repeatedly disrupted or appeared poised to disrupt American presidential elections over the years, might be making a comeback.\n\nWILL OCTOBER 2024 SURPRISE THE US BEFORE NOVEMBER 5 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION?\n\nWith the first anniversary of the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel, the Middle East on the verge of all-out war, and concerns raised by Hillary Clinton about social media disinformation from Russia, Iran, China, and pro-Trump media, the 'October Surprise' looms again ahead of the closely contested November election.\n\nGiven the tight contest between Trump and Harris, with most polls in swing states showing results within the margin of error, any of the poll issues could be crucial and turn into events. The few who remain undecided, especially in the swing states, could be swayed by these last-minute developments, is the fear.\n\nIn light of the concerns about potential last-minute events that could influence the outcome of the tightly contested race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, here are the few issues that could play a spoilsport with the potential to sway undecided voters or alter the narrative of the campaign on the eve of the election.\n\nThe Middle East is on the brink of an all-out war, with recent missile strikes by Iran on Israel marking a massive escalation in the region's year-long war. The Hamas war that turned one today, combined with Israel's offensive into Lebanon presents multiple challenges for not just the parties involved, but for the US, which has allied with Israel and its offensives through some of the most violent human rights violations as alleged by critics.\n\nadvertisement\n\nOn the other hand, the US is also wary of asking Benjamin Netanyahu to tone the heat down, or being drawn into the war.\n\nIn the meantime, Israel, under the somewhat unpopular Netanyahu, has intelligently used the US election window to carry out its intensified rampage on its hostile neighbours and proxies. In the poll-bound US, none of the candidates, Democrats Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump are at the risk of losing their voter base, if they happen to suggest de-escalation of the war. Israel, on the other hand, wants to extract the most out of the period, militarily.\n\nUS politicians, regardless of their political affiliation, cannot afford to ignore this, especially with the influence of the domestic war lobby in mind.\n\nRepublican candidate and former president Donald Trump is facing renewed scrutiny due to the surfacing 165-page document released by special counsel Jack Smith, detailing a federal investigation into alleged interference in the 2020 Presidential election, when Trump lost to outgoing President Joe Biden.\n\nThe document is said to have chalked out Trump's extensive efforts to overturn the election outcome. The 165-page document could lead some voters to reevaluate Donald Trump's suitability for the presidency.\n\nOn the domestic front, a strike by approximately 45,000 dockworkers, affecting 36 ports from Maine to Texas, could have a sway on the Democratic prospects in the November election. The labour dispute, which included demands for a 77% wage hike over six years and a ban on automation, is believed to exacerbate inflation and disrupt key ocean shipping routes, potentially influencing voter sentiment.\n\nadvertisement\n\nHowever, for now, the dockworkers are returning to work after their union reached a deal to suspend a strike that could have caused shortages and higher prices if it had dragged on, reported the Associated Press.\n\nHurricane Helene that inflicted significant damage in the states of North Carolina and Georgia, two critical electoral battlegrounds, might also be a factor. The resulting crisis, killing more than 227, has become a political issue.\n\nHarris and President Joe Biden, during their visit to the Carolinas, tried to show their commitment and competence in supporting devastated communities. It was seen as an attempt to counter false claims from former President Donald Trump about the administration's response, reported the Associated Press.\n\n\"There's nobody that's handled a hurricane or storm worse than what they're [Biden-Harris administration] doing right now,\" Donald Trump had alleged.\n\nHillary Clinton has also warned about the potential for social media disinformation campaigns orchestrated by Russia, Iran, China, and pro-Trump media outlets, reported USA Today. Such disinformation could distort public perceptions of the candidates, particularly targeting Kamala Harris, Clinton underlined.\n\nadvertisement\n\nHILLARY CLINTON TO DONALD TRUMP, FOXED BY OCTOBER SURPRISE\n\nThat said, the 'October Surprise', not so much of a modern phenomenon, has influenced US polls in the past. Although it all started during the attack on the US embassy in Iran and the hostage crisis of 1980, it has made a mark in US elections as recently as 2016, when Wikileaks' shock ruined a Democratic victory, and the Covid-19 wave in 2020, a response to which was said to have costed Donald Trump a re-election.\n\nIRANIAN HOSTAGE CRISIS CLAIMED CARTER IN 1980\n\nDuring the 1980 presidential election, President Jimmy Carter's failure to secure the release of American hostages held in Iran was a major issue. There were allegations that the Reagan campaign negotiated with Iranian officials to delay the release of the hostages until after the election, which could have boosted Carter's chances if the hostages were freed before the vote.\n\nThe event in Tehran, though never proven, is often cited as a classic example of an October Surprise. Republican Regan won the election and became the American President in 1980.\n\nOn January 20, 1981, the day of Reagan's presidential inauguration, just minutes after he finished delivering his inaugural address, Iran announced the release of 52 American hostages who had been held captive for 444 days.\n\nHOW WIKILEAKS LEFT HILLARY CLINTON BATTERED IN 2016\n\nRight before the 2016 presidential election, Democrat candidate Hillary Clinton, faced the massive Wikileaks scandal that would cost her presidency. On October 7, WikiLeaks launched a two-month-long series of email dumps, later dubbed the \"Podesta Leaks,\" which involved thousands of emails from the chairman of Clinton's presidential campaign.\n\nThese emails showed a number of controversial details, including her conflicting stances on some issues, that came to bite Clinton. An email also suggested that a debate question had been known to Clinton before a primary debate.\n\nJust 11 days before the 2016 presidential election, FBI Director James Comey sent a letter to Congress announcing to open an investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server. Although the investigation ultimately did not change the FBI's previous conclusion, the announcement narrowed Clinton's lead in the polls and is widely speculated to have brought her defeat.\n\nBy 2020, the term was so widely used that it came to describe any election-related news happening in October, noted a Rutgers News piece.\n\nNYT AND COVID STING TRUMP IN 2020\n\nThe 2020 'October Surprises' began with The New York Times publishing an investigation into then President Donald Trump's taxes, revealing he had paid only $750 in taxes in 2016 and 2017. The report also indicated that Trump was over $400 million in debt. On October 16, Forbes contradicted this, stating the debt exceeded $1 billion.\n\nThe investigations that saw Trump being ousted in the election made some term it an 'October Surprise'.\n\nAgain, the same year, when Trump and his wife Melania Trump were hospitalised after being tested positive for Covid-19, many viewed it as another October Surprise. It was a part of a larger outbreak within the White House, while the US topped 9 million Covid-19 cases that month. Disease expert Anthony Fauci labelled the White House outbreak a \"super-spreader,\" that infected over 30 people, including senior White House officials.\n\nTrump, who had initially downplayed the Covid-19 threat and made repeated alleged false claims regarding the virus, faced public scrutiny.\n\n\"Relative to other issues, most voters -- even many Trump supporters -- saw the pandemic as a weakness for the incumbent. Attitudes toward and experiences with COVID affected vote choice, but perhaps less than one would have expected ex ante, because Trump supporters downplayed the pandemic, consistently said the worst of the crisis had passed, and emphasised instead issues on which they felt Trump outperformed Biden, such as the economy.\" noted American professor Kathleen Hall Jamieson, in her book 'Democracy amid Crises: Polarization, Pandemic, Protests, and Persuasion'.\n\nAlthough the 'October Surprises' have been said to have swayed voters in US elections, presidential or otherwise, its exact impact cannot be quantified and assessed. But a plethora of issues taking place in the 2024 US presidential election narrative just a month before the polls on November 5, certainly gives way to speculations if any of these factors or their offshoots can sway votes in favour or against the poll prospects of the contenders.\n\nPublished By: Sushim Mukul Published On: Oct 7, 2024",
